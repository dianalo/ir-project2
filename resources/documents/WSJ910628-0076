Nonetheless, Willard Bunn III recently agreed to turnover ownership to Banc One Corp., the Ohio bankingpowerhouse.   Mr. Bunn wasn't cashing in to live the good life. Instead,the chief executive of the $1.2 billion bank wants to getBanc One's clout behind him, go shopping for other localbanks and build his company's franchise. &quot;With the help ofBanc One's more liquid stock, we can do in one year what itmight take seven years on our own,&quot; he explains.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, Banc One itself isn't resting on its oars. Ithas two other acquisition deals pending, including anagreement to pay $347 million in stock for First IllinoisCorp. in suburban Chicago.   Bankers all over the country are just as hot on theacquisition trail, and for the same reason. They want tobuild market share in local areas before outsiders, banks andnonbank companies alike, come in and woo away individual andcorporate customers. So, even amid the worst banking crisissince the 1930s, the industry is embarking on a consolidationdrive that will create a new banking elite and put thebanking business of most of the nation's towns and cities inthe hands of fewer and fewer players.   Banking consultants say the merger wave is just beginning.&quot;By 1995, there will be a major in-market merger in at leasthalf of the top markets in the country,&quot; says JamesMcCormick, president of FMCG, a New York bank-consultingfirm. Those mergers, by offering opportunities to squeeze outoverlapping costs and produce big profit gains, &quot;can doublestock prices and dramatically improve a company's debtrating,&quot; he says, adding, &quot;That can strategically takesomeone from an also-ran to a key player.&quot;   The latest case of this fast-accelerating trend is thedecision yesterday by Candamp;S/Sovran Corp. to seriously consideran offer from NCNB Corp., a plan that would pose toughchallenges for NCNB's management but would create thesecond-largest banking company in the country.   Candamp;S/Sovran's decision followed by only three days adefinitive agreement between Wachovia Corp. and SouthCarolina National Bank to merge in a $797 million deal thatitself would be the largest bank merger in nearly two years.   The back-to-back moves caught the banking world bysurprise. For months, announcements of merger deals involvingCalifornia or New York banking giants had been anticipated.Now, with the momentum of regional mergers grabbing thespotlight, the pressure to consolidate is likely to increase,especially among moneycenter banks.   &quot;Managements fear being left behind,&quot; says Edward Furash,a banking consultant in Washington, D.C. He says the prospectthat NCNB can leapfrog from seventh in size to second &quot;goesto what is in the hearts and minds of bankers as they lookahead. They're asking themselves, `Am I right-sized, and canI make it?'&quot;   Mr. Furash believes the 10,000 or so independentcommercial banking companies today will shrink to fewer than7,000 within five years. But meanwhile, control over marketshare will grow, with 300 banks holding about 85% of U.S.banking assets, he says. &quot;The consolidation will be among thelarger banking companies buying each other up, rather thanmassive acquisitions of small banks,&quot; he predicts.   The reaction of bankers around the country to NCNB'sambitious plan is an awakening of sorts. &quot;It would be a realwatershed if all of a sudden you had another bank of morethan $100 billion in assets,&quot; says David Kemper, chiefexecutive of Commerce Bancshares, a $6.5 billion Missouribanking company. &quot;It means superregionals are really going toeclipse money centers as the dominant force.&quot;   James McDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods, abank-research firm, says that for some New York banks, &quot;thechoice is to get on with it {and merge}, or watch.&quot; Watching,he adds, &quot;is comparable to being put to the back of theclass.&quot;   In the Southeast, John G. Medlin Jr., Wachovia's chiefexecutive, says he doubts that banks in the region would feelthreatened by his bank's pending deal or a possible merger ofNCNB with Candamp;S/Sovran. But the possible NCNB deal, he adds,&quot;is more worrisome to the money centers in terms of theability to participate in investment banking, money-marketactivities, international banking and so forth.&quot;   Giving the merger movement a boost have been therelatively strong stock prices of healthy banks, which usethe stock for acquisitions. Their prices held up well duringthe pummeling absorbed by bank stocks last fall and havesurged in the bank-stock rally this year. At the same time,says Reid Nagle, president of SNL Securities, potentialsellers, after the plunge in bank-stock prices last fall,have a keener realization of how abruptly the value of theircompanies can decline. Thus, they are more prone to take agood offer if one comes along.   Also propelling consolidation, says Allerton Smith, ananalyst at First Boston Corp., is the fact that &quot;bankmanagements don't see robust loan growth in the foreseeablefuture.&quot;   With loan problems continuing to surface at many banks,such as Wells Fargo Corp. this week, there's more reason forcaution about acquisitions, consultants say. Even if NCNB andCandamp;S/Sovran get together, for instance, loan troubles atSovran, especially in the Washington-area market, could provetroublesome for some time. When Candamp;S fled from an NCNB offeronce before, in 1989, it didn't fully know the potential forbad loans that lurked at Sovran, with which it mergedinstead.   Now, NCNB may face similar problems. Candamp;S/Sovran is,especially on the Sovran side, an amalgamation of smallerbanks whose cultures haven't yet been blended. Moreover, theloan problems have caused much bitterness between the Candamp;Scrowd and the Sovran crowd. And neither NCNB nor Candamp;S/Sovranhas much management depth, bankers say. When NCNB made itsforay into Texas in 1988, it sent many of its best managersthere.   NCNB has its own real-estate problems, although they areoffset by its tremendous tax-sheltered profits in Texas.   &quot;It's great to talk about synergies, but bringing theminto reality is another thing,&quot; an investment banker says.   But Hugh McColl, NCNB's expansion-minded chief executive,envisions his banking company, already the nation'sseventh-largest, as a dominant, forward-looking institutioneager to adapt to the changing banking scene.   He has long yearned for Candamp;S/Sovran, which would fittogether well with NCNB. For one thing, Candamp;S/Sovran would giveNCNB dominance in the crucial Atlanta market, which NCNB hasnever been able to crack. And although the two companiesoverlap in Florida and South Carolina, they compliment eachother in the rest of the Southeast. &quot;It's a superb fit withour franchise, and it would strengthen us in strategicmarkets,&quot; says Russell Page, NCNB's senior vice president ofcorporate communications.   Although the cost savings of an in-market merger aren'tthere, NCNB, as the dominant party, would probably take toughsteps to slash costs and weld the two entities together. Incontrast, Candamp;S and Sovran joined in a merger of equals inwhich, until recently, social niceties took precedence overcost cutting.   Other bankers note that although they see nationwideconsolidation as inevitable, the winners in the long run willbe the best-managed, not necessarily the biggest. &quot;You don'twant to consolidate yourself into more trouble,&quot; says FrankCahouet, chairman of Mellon Bank Corp. His Pittsburgh companyacquired $5 billion in deposits from a failed Philadelphiathrift last year and now is ready for more acquisitions. Likemost bankers on the prowl, Mr. Cahouet says, &quot;We're lookingin {his own} market and in adjacent markets.&quot;   Gaining market share is key to survival, whether a bank isa superregional, large bank or a community bank, experts say.&quot;If you're a $50 million bank and have 35% market share ofthe households in an area, it doesn't make any difference ifa holding company of size moves in,&quot; Mr. Furash, theconsultant, says. &quot;Price warfare only works at the margin,not with loyal customers.&quot;   Some recent blockbuster acquisitions, adds William Gregor,a senior vice president of Mac Group, a consulting firm,create the potential for a &quot;geographic manifest destiny.&quot;Referring to the recent acquisition of the failed Bank of NewEngland by Fleet/Norstar Corp., he says, &quot;Once Fleet gets theMassachusetts and Connecticut operations of BNE woven intoits franchise, it will be very hard for any outsider toparatroop in and dislodge their business.&quot;   The regional giants are only part of the story, however.Bankers say there are simply too many banks, most with toolittle market share. Until their numbers are whittled downenough to bring more stability to the industry, mergers andacquisitions will be where much of the growth in bankingoccurs, they say.   &quot;Concentration is the way to go,&quot; says John McCoy, BancOne chairman. &quot;You've got to be No. 1, 2 or 3 to be able tomove the market, or you simply get whipsawed by the otherguys.&quot;   His $44 billion company is now concentrated in Ohio,Wisconsin, Indiana and Texas, in addition to its recentforays into Illinois. He says the advantage of growing as asuperregional bank in neighboring states is the ability toshare management and marketing expenses and to spend lesstime traveling to visit subsidiaries.   For Boatmen's Bancshares of St. Louis, the plannedacquisition of First Interstate Bank of Oklahoma dovetailswith a large Oklahoma business that stems from Boatmen'spurchase of a Kansas City bank in the mid-1980s. &quot;This fitsour strategy of blocking and tackling in the centralMidwest,&quot; says Andrew Craig III, Boatmen's chief executive.Because of the opportunities he sees for mergers over thenext five years in the 10 or so states he considers home, heexpects his $17 billion banking company to grow to about $25billion.   The spurt of regional bank combinations is coming at atime when Congress is moving to allow interstate banking --that is, to let a bank in one state put its banner onbranches throughout the country. Under current law, when onebank reaches across state lines, in the states that allowout-of-state ownership, the bank must set up a separatesubsidiary.   But such a new law isn't expected to have as profound animpact on the structure of banking as the current push formarket share within regions. As Edward Crutchfield Jr.,chairman of First Union Corp., a fast-growing North Carolinabanking company, says, &quot;We'd rather have larger market sharein the states we're in than go to another state to be anotherpinpoint on the map.&quot; Under Mr. Crutchfield, who earned thenickname &quot;Fast Eddy&quot; for his spate of mergers, First Uniongrew from a $7 billion institution in Charlotte to a $40billion company in four Southeastern states.   Interstate banking would propel mergers in states that nowrestrict entry, however. In Missouri, for instance, wherecontiguous state bank ownership is allowed, interstatebanking would open the borders to such out-of-state giants asNBD Bancorp, Norwest Corp. and Banc One. Although Mr. Kemperof Commerce Bancshares believes that they would be eager toenter such large markets as Kansas City and St. Louis, hestill thinks his bank may have the edge.   &quot;If we compete against a $50 billion bank, we have theadvantage of being closer to our customer so we can maneuverfaster. We don't have layers of bureaucracy,&quot; he says. Andalthough larger banks may be willing to make bigger loans tomajor customers, &quot;they won't have an edge over us in productlines or in systems.&quot; Nonetheless, to be prepared, &quot;Ourfeeling is we have to increase market share in our primarymarkets.&quot;   No one is saying, however, that some superregionalcompanies won't eventually grow into national powerhouses.Many will use the strategy of acquiring a bank in acontiguous market and then using it as a base to gain marketshare by acquiring assets and deposits from the government'sstockpile of failed thrifts and banks.   &quot;Eventually there will be coast-to-coast banks after thehome-market mergers allow them to become more powerful,&quot; saysMr. McCormick of FMCG. Sometime around 1995, he adds, &quot;Weimagine at least five nationwide powerhouses will be emergingthat have a strategy for acquisitions out of their markets.&quot;   Meanwhile, Mr. Furash says, more and more bankers areseizing opportunities &quot;to put together financial institutionsthat will dominate their market areas for a generation tocome.&quot;   ---   Betsy Morris in Atlanta contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
