The rapid growth could increase pressures on naturalresources needed for global survival, said the U.N.Population Fund's annual report, issued in London, and after2050, &quot;significant growth will continue for another 100years.&quot;   Estimates are being revised upward, despite strikingsuccesses by family planning programs in spreading the use ofcontraception and bringing down birth rates. &quot;Population mayeventually level off at about 11.6 billion,&quot; the report said.But some estimates put it as high as 14.5 billion within thenext century. The U.N. seeks stability at 10.2 billion by2075.   About 95% of the increase is coming in the poorer,developing nations least able to cope, with Africa leadingthe way. North American and European populations willincrease little through births, but the industrial nationscould be pressured by immigrants fleeing poverty andenvironmental problems.                                                                                                          FEW FEMALE SOLDIERS IN EUROPE                                                                                                          Women, a tiny minority among Western European soldiers,should be given more responsibility in their countries' armedforces, a Western European Union report urged. The union, theonly Western European defense body, is made up of Belgium,Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,Portugal and Spain. Its report found no female soldiers inItaly; 459 women -- confined until recently to healthservices -- among Germany's 433,450 armed forces; and 20,000women in France's 550,000 total.                                                                                                          KUWAIT PLANS TO EXECUTE SPIES                                                                                                          Anyone found guilty of espionage during Iraq's seven-monthoccupation of Kuwait will be executed, Kuwait's actingattorney general, Hamed al-Othman, said. Of about 900 casesunder study, more than 200 persons being held -- mostlyPalestinians or Iraqis -- may be brought to trial soon oncharges of collaboration with the occupation forces, which insome cases could be construed as spying.                                                                                                          CHURCH BACKS DOWN IN POLAND                                                                                                          Poland's primate, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, withdrew a demandto abolish the Roman Catholic Church's constitutionalseparation from the state and effectively make Catholicismthe official religion. The church was Solidarity's strongestally in its struggle to overthrow communism, but its role hascome under increasing scrutiny since the union movement wonpower in 1989.                                                                                                          MALAYSIAN LIBEL SUIT SETTLED                                                                                                          A Malaysian newspaper agreed to apologize to formerSingapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in an out-of-courtsettlement of a libel suit. The Star, An English-languagedaily newspaper, will pay Mr. Lee $100,000 in damages andlegal costs, and apologize for two 1987 articles allegingcorruption in Singapore. Mr. Lee said in the lawsuit filed inKuala Lumpur's high court that the two commentaries were&quot;falsely and maliciously&quot; published by the paper's editor inchief, V.K. Chin, and Star Publications (Malaysia).                                                                                                          CULTURAL GAP FOR JAPANESE                                                                                                          The Japanese enjoy more economic affluence than citizensof other industrialized countries but lag behind them inacademic and cultural activities, a government survey found.The poll, mainly based on 1989 data, weighed eight categoriessuch as crime and suicide rates, and life expectancy --unconventional economic statistics, the Kyodo news agencysaid. Japan also ranked first in health.                                                                                                          BRITAIN SETS EC BACK ON LABOR                                                                                                          Britain opposed granting the European Community greaterpowers over social and labor policies -- a setback forpolitical-union negotiations because of the importance mostEC countries and the EC Commission attach to bolstering thecommunity's role in social legislation.   The current treaty gives the EC a limited role in socialand labor legislation and subjects most such rules tounanimous voting. This veto right has allowed Britain toprevent passage of several EC proposals, including those thatwould require management to inform workers about corporatedecisions.   Proposed treaty changes would extend areas covered by ECsocial policy and increase the use of majority voting.   Separately, EC and European Free Trade Association talkson merging the blocs to create a single market of 19 nationsand 380 million consumers were said to have dim prospects.Discord emerged on creating a European Economic Area, inwhich the EFTA members would adopt EC rules on the freemovement of people, goods, services and capital, to coincidewith the EC's late-1992 unification. The EFTA members areAustria, Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland andLiechtenstein.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          For the first time since independence in 1975, Angolansmay form political parties, hold political meetings and takepart in demonstrations, as legislation passed in March tookeffect. Elections are to be held late next year. . . .Posthumous weddings in China, an ancient custom nearly wipedout after the 1949 communist takeover, are being revived inthe countryside, the official Farmers Daily said. Thepractice is supposed to ensure that unmarried people willhave a partner in the afterlife.</TEXT></DOC>
