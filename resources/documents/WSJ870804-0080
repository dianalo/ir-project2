Cox chairman and chief executive officer.    Mr. Cox, 45-year-old vice president, corporate planning, at Time Inc., was formerly president of the Home Box Office Inc. unit's networks group. He is the second former HBO executive to join Viacom, which is 83%-owned by National Amusements Inc. National Amusements' chairman, Sumner Redstone, recently tapped Frank Biondi, the one-time chief executive of Home Box Office who most recently was chief executive of Coca-Cola Co.'s television unit, as Viacom's new chief executive.    Mr. Redstone had approached Mr. Cox about the Showtime job even before Mr. Biondi was hired. Messrs. Biondi and Cox had worked closely together at HBO, and Mr. Biondi said yesterday he was &quot;thrilled to be reunited&quot; with Mr. Cox.    The two executives will need all their combined HBO experience to compete against their former employer; Showtime is less than half the size of pay-TV giant HBO, which has 19 million subscribers.    Showtime has been rudderless since its former chief executive, Neil Austrian, left last year after failing to persuade Viacom's former management to allow him to spin off Showtime into a new public company. The vacancy wasn't filled, and Viacom executives themselves became embroiled in a fight to take the company private in a leveraged buyout. They lost to a higher bid from Mr. Redstone, who acquired his stake for $3.4 billion.    As a result of the upheavals at Viacom, Mr. Cox said: &quot;Showtime has been a neglected enterprise for the last year. My first aim is to get it back on its feet.&quot;    Like Mr. Biondi, Mr. Cox graduated from Princeton University and holds an M.B.A. from Harvard University. He joined Time out of graduate school in 1965 and joined HBO in 1976, serving in various marketing, technical and affiliate relations posts. More recently, he had moved over to Time's corporate planning operations. </TEXT></DOC>
