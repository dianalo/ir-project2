The Munich newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung said Genscher angeredDefense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg by not toning down remarksaimed at the United States and Britain about short-range nuclearweapons.   It said officials within Kohl's Christian Democratic Union andits Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, fear theNATO feud could damage West German-U.S. relations.   Sources within the parties, speaking on condition of anonymity,confirmed the newspaper's account.   Kohl and Genscher have called for East-West negotiations toreduce short-range nuclear weapons, which would be used on Germansoil. The United States and Britain strongly oppose such talks.   Genscher has taken the lead in pressing the issue, while Kohlappears to be standing back to give North Atlantic TreatyOrganization nations a chance to patch up differences.   In TV and radio interviews, Genscher has also been vocal in hisopposition to making an immediate decision on whether to upgradeNATO's short-range nuclear missiles.   He said on May 4, ``We have the first and last word about thestationing of rockets on our territory, and no one else.''   Most NATO short-range nuclear weapons are based in West Germany.   Sueddeutsche Zeitung quoted Stoltenberg as saying Genscher ``isnot among those who contribute to a calming'' of NATO's internaldispute.   It further quoted him as saying, ``It is comical that Genscherappeals for other coalition partners to soften their own remarkswhile he constantly speaks his own mind.''   Stoltenberg is a Christian Democrat. Genscher is a FreeDemocrat, the junior partner in Kohl's coalition.   The newspaper reported Michaela Geiger, foreign affairs expertof the Christian Social Union, as accusing Genscher of using hispower within the coalition to give the mistaken impression that theBonn government wants short-range nuclear weapons eliminatedcompletely.   Other Christian Social Union and Christian Democratic officialsfear the NATO feud could ``damage the American view of Germany,''the newspaper said.   The comments were made during a private meeting Monday night ofofficials of the sister parties, the newspaper said.   The Defense Ministry meanwhile announced that Stoltenberg wouldvisit the United States from May 17-19 for discussions that willinclude defense topics.   He will meet with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Secretary ofState James A. Baker III, said ministry spokesman Winfried Dunkel.   The Warsaw Pact also wants negotiations on short-range nuclearweapons, and denounces NATO plans to upgrade its short-range Lancerockets.   NATO says Lance missiles will be have be replaced because oftheir age, and plans to upgrade the rockets by extending theirrange.   The West German news magazine Stern quoted Yuli Kvitsinsky, theSoviet ambassador in Bonn, as saying that increasing the range ofLance rockets would ``destroy the basis'' of the IntermediateNuclear Forces treaty, under which the two superpowers areeliminating intermediate-range nuclear rockets.   ``If NATO now builds a missile that perhaps has a range of 20 to50 kilometers (12 to 30 miles) less than our SS-23, that is abetrayal,'' Kvitsinsky was quoted as saying.   Soviet SS-23 rockets are being eliminated under the INF treaty.   Stern telexed excerpts of the interview to other newsorganizations in advance of Thursday's publication.</TEXT></DOC>
