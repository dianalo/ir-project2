Coking mixtures consisting of types G, Zh, K andOS coal from the USSR were evaluated. Grain size ranged from 0 to morethan 12 mm. The mixtures consisted of prepared coal, coal fines and flotationconcentrate. Effects of coal type, coal physical and chemical propertiesas well as petrology on the optimum crushing scheme were analyzed. Crushingof coal mixtures and selective crushing of each component are comparativelyevaluated. Effects of selective crushing on coking mixture homogeneityand its caking power are evaluated. 10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
