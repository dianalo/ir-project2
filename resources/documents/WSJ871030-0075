They haven't any choice, for just as they were beginning to emerge from political obscurity by defining who they are and what they represent, the earth shifted. With the stock-market crash Oct. 19 and the turbulence that followed, the focus of the campaign switched to the economy.    The Democrats are still groggily emerging from the shock of the crash, but some movement already is discernible:    --Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona is adjusting his controversial consumption-tax plan, saying the tax wouldn't be applied during a recession.    --Influential supporters are urging Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri to play down his emphasis on a tough trade proposal that many of his rivals say is protectionist, but he resists, saying, &quot;I intend to turn up the volume.&quot;    --Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee plans to attack Mr. Gephardt's proposal as a replay of the Smoot-Hawley tariff that plunged the nation deeper into a depression in 1930.    --The Rev. Jesse Jackson is scheduling a series of economic talks to push his populist attack on &quot;corporate greed&quot; that he says leads to the &quot;merge, purge and submerge&quot; syndrome -- the merging of giant corporations, the purging of their workers and the submerging of the economy.    --Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts is stepping up his attacks on Wall Street, especially on merger and acquisition experts &quot;who have made billions in paper profits these past few years without producing a thing or creating a single new job.&quot;    --Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, the closest thing to a New Dealer in the race, is working hard to remind audiences that he is a longtime critic of Reaganomics and a supporter of a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution.    Although economic problems seem likely to benefit the Democrats, they may have their work cut out for them. The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, taken this week, shows 43% of likely voters thought Republicans are better able to handle the nation's economic ills, unchanged from a poll seven months ago. But only 33% gave the nod to the Democrats, down from 38% seven months ago. On inflation, the public by a 51%-to-29% majority prefers the Republicans, and the GOP comes out ahead on handling the budget deficit by 40% to 34%, according to the latest Journal/NBC News poll.    To be sure, the poll was taken only a week after the market crash, and public opinion could shift significantly if the economic situation worsens.    Before the crash, each of the Democratic candidates tried to stake out a distinctive position in an effort to break out of a crowd that was largely unknown to the voters. Sen. Gore, for example, tried to portray himself as more conservative on national-security issues than his rivals, a tactic designed to win votes in the South. Gov. Babbitt embraced the consumption tax in the hope his lagging campaign might win credit for candor and courage. Mr. Jackson, along with his talk of merging, purging and submerging, hit hard in attacks on American policy in the Persian Gulf and Central America.    But the crash, says Kirk O'Donnell, a Democrat and head of the Center for National Policy, &quot;changes the whole complexion of the campaign.&quot;    The candidates no longer have the luxury of choosing their own campaign themes. The economy is now the theme for all of them.    But they face the same old problem. They still have to define themselves, but now they must do it in a specific context. The almost certain outcome is that the candidates are heading into a period of much sharper conflict.    &quot;This issue opens an opportunity for one of these guys to gain an advantage over the others,&quot; says Arthur Davis, a former Democratic Party chairman in Iowa.    It's already beginning to happen.    Sen. Gore's camp is criticizing Rep. Gephardt's trade position. Fred Martin, Sen. Gore's campaign manager, says, &quot;The last thing the country needs now is to resort to protectionism, which would compound a world-wide economic collapse.&quot;    Rep. Gephardt's camp says Mr. Gore lacks experience in dealing with economic issues, that Sen. Simon's support for a balanced-budget amendment is a gimmick and that Gov. Dukakis's anti-deficit plan is another gimmick, based on a tax-amnesty plan that was tried in Massachusetts. Moreover, the Gephardt camp argues, Gov. Dukakis's experience generally is limited to his home state. &quot;Critics of my trade policy are either too inexperienced to understand the world economy or they're shopping for political advantage,&quot; says Mr. Gephardt.    Republicans, meanwhile, are arguing that the relative inexperience of the entire Democratic field might ultimately prompt voters to turn in November 1988 to the Republicans. &quot;When the economy goes sour, Republicans normally have a hard time surviving,&quot; notes John Deardourff, a Republican strategist. &quot;But if the Democrats don't start doing a little better, the voters might turn to the more trustworthy Republican hands.&quot;    Most of the Democratic candidates changed their plans so they could seize on the campaign's most urgent issue. Rep. Gephardt will deliver two economic speeches in Iowa next week, meeting head-on allegations that his trade plan is protectionist in the Smoot-Hawley mold. Mr. Jackson will be in New York today, talking economics at a forum sponsored by Gov. Mario Cuomo, after which he will meet with business writers. Mr. Jackson will press his argument that he alone among the candidates &quot;has been out there and has seen what is happening to real people,&quot; says Carol O'Cleireachain, an economic adviser. &quot;He will say Wall Street and LaSalle Street can't escape Main Street anymore.&quot;    Gov. Dukakis planned to discuss rural health care in speeches last week, but emphasized economics instead. &quot;We're going to keep hitting the economy,&quot; says Susan Estrich, the Dukakis campaign manager.    Sen. Simon says he's been stressing in a five-day tour of New Hampshire that the situation is &quot;a little like football and baseball training: You've got to get back to the basics. You don't spend more money than you take in.&quot;    So far, President Reagan has escaped harsh criticism. Mr. Babbitt, in fact, is addressing much of his criticism instead to Vice President George Bush, who this month pledged to oppose tax increases and to try to lower the tax on capital gains. &quot;The notion that a candidate for president is saying he would handle these issues with another tax cut,&quot; says Mr. Babbitt, &quot;is a reflection of how unreal the situation is.&quot;    ---   &quot;Looking ahead to 1988, which political party -- the Republicans or the Democrats -- do you think would be better able to handle the nation's economic problems?&quot;    Republicans 43%     Democrats                                     33%   No difference (volunteered only) 8%     Not sure                                      16%</TEXT></DOC>
