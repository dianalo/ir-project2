Anoverview of the gas industry in this context covers union structure,salaried personnel, and the history of labor relations. Noting that thegovernment has the responsibility for writing regulations governing laborrelations, the author also points out that the rules, despite frequentamendments, are essentially unchanged since the early 1900s. The regulatorycommission maintains its independence, operates and makes decisions inpublic, and is mindful of the public interest. The gas unions would dowell to focus on servicing their members instead of trying to expandtheir power.</TEXT></DOC>
