Clearly taking the creditors' word is not adequate,either.   It would appear that the feeling is mutual as far asconsumers vs. TRW are concerned. While TRW may think thecreditors are its customers, its real customers ultimatelyare consumers.</LP><TEXT>   Furthermore, TRW does not have a clear idea of exactlywhat its product is. It may think its product is informationwhen the product actually is the service of gathering anddisseminating information generated by third parties. Theaccuracy and reliability of the TRW data are the coreproduct.   If TRW does not believe the consumers' word, and consumersdo not believe TRW's word, then why use TRW? If all that TRWis selling is accuracy, then it needs either to improve itsproduct drastically or exit the business.   Eugene Krebs   Epping, N.H.</TEXT></DOC>
