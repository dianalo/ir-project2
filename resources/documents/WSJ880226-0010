Wins Round in Suit Filed Against Amgen </HL><SO> </SO><CO> GENI AMGN </CO><IN> PHA </IN><DATELINE> CAMBRIDGE, Mass.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A U.S. district court in Boston granted Genetics Institute Inc. a summary judgment against Amgen Inc. in its lawsuit charging Amgen with infringing its patent on an experimental drug to treat anemia.    The biotechnology firms are disputing rights to erythropoietin, or EPO, an experimental drug that controls red-blood-cell production. Genetics Institute charged in its suit that Amgen's genetically engineered version of EPO infringes a Genetics Institute patent on a purified, naturally occurring form. Genetics Institute's suit includes as a plaintiff Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., a Japanese firm that has licensed Genetics Institute's version of EPO.    The judgment against Amgen probably won't have any immediate effect on the companies' EPO programs. Thousand Oaks, Calif.-based Amgen, the leader in the race to develop the drug, is expected to receive permission to market the drug from the Food and Drug Administration before competitors do. And while Amgen's EPO is the only version on the market, courts probably won't let patent infringement claims by competitors block Amgen from selling it, said Bruce Eisen, Genetics Institute's chief patent attorney.    When Genetics Institute's EPO is approved for marketing, Chugai and Genetics Institute may seek an injunction based on the patent-suit judgment blocking Amgen from selling the drug, Mr. Eisen said.    Amgen, as previously reported, has filed a patent infringement suit against Genetics Institute and Chugai, charging that they infringed its patent on a process for producing genetically engineered EPO.    In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Genetics shares closed at $22.75, up 37.5 cents; Amgen closed at $33.75, down $2.    George B. Rathmann, Amgen chairman, said he is disappointed with the court ruling, but said Amgen doesn't &quot;plan to alter our course of action or change our strategy&quot; in developing EPO. </TEXT></DOC>
