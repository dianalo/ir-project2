(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The sister of the longest-held MiddleEast hostage is asking Hank Williams Jr. and other country musicstars to sign a birthday card to cheer her brother during captivity.   Peggy Say is asking performers to sign the 1{- by 2-foot cardduring rehearsals for Monday's 22nd annual Country MusicAssociation awards show.   Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press, was abducted March 16, 1985. He will be 41 onOct. 27.   The card will read: ``Happy birthday Terry from Music City, USA.We love you and are praying for your freedom.''   ``I've asked particularly to have Hank Williams Jr. sign itbecause he is Terry's favorite,'' Mrs. Say said from her home inCadiz, Ky.   She said the card would be displayed at a ceremony on Anderson'sbirthday, and details would be released to newspapers in Beirut,Lebanon, in hopes of reaching her brother.   ``Hopefully Terry will see it and know that he's truly notforgotten,'' Mrs. Say said.   A spokesman for the State Department said the government doesnot foresee immediate freedom for other hostages following acaptive's release earlier this week.   Mithileshwar Singh, a 60-year-old Indian citizen and residentalien of the United States, was in good spirits following hisrelease Monday after 20 months of captivity.   A group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation ofPalestine claimed responsibility for Singh's kidnapping and said itfreed him as a goodwill gesture.   His release raised hopes for the freedom of the 16 foreignhostages still held in Lebanon.   Mrs. Say said she expected her brother to be released by the endof the year. She did not indicate, however, that she had anyspecific information about an impending release.   The latest word on Anderson's condition came from MarcelFontaine, a French hostage released in May, according to Mrs. Say.   ``He said that Terry was strong and determined to survive, thatTerry felt it would be the U.S. election before he would get outand that he was gearing for that,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
