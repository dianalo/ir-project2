Such facilities often don't have a cardiologist who canexamine patients' hearts on video screens attached toultrasound machines, interpreting the subtle signs that cantell whether chest pains call for emergency bypass surgery orfor Alka-Seltzer. Doctors at small hospitals must mail thevideotapes to big-city heart specialists for detaileddiagnoses, a process that can take days.   Claritek Corp., a San Diego start-up, has developed acomputer system called HeartLink that sends live images of abeating heart over a phone line to a specialist's computerscreen, circumventing the problem that ordinary video signalsare too big to fit into phone lines. Claritek's system usescopyrighted mathematical algorithms in an encoder device thattakes a heart's image from the ultrasound machine andtranslates critical heart movements -- such as a valve'sopening and closing -- into digital codes that fit into phonelines.   A decoder in the heart specialist's personal computer atthe other end of the phone translates the code into a colorimage of a heart. The computer-generated heart preciselymimics the patient's heart, allowing the cardiologist todiagnose problems and give prescriptions as if the patientwere in the same room.   Claritek, whose developers include a TRW Inc.mathematician and a Hollywood cartoon animator, has installeda pilot HeartLink system at the University of California, SanDiego, where cardiologists say early results are promising.It plans to place other machines, which it expects to selleventually for $350,000 to $700,000, in California, Kentucky,Pennsylvania and Massachusetts university hospitals.                                                                                                          Video Standards Grow   Passe Before They Exist                                                                                                          MULTIMEDIA proponents, who want to conduct videoconferences over phone lines and send movies into PCs, arewaiting for standards-setting groups to agree on common waysto compress those video images so they fit on such equipment.   But standards are having trouble keeping up withtechnology. The world telecommunications body, CCITT, forexample, is expected to adopt this year a standard formula tocompress video images into phone lines for teleconferencesand TV phones. But, says an executive at video-conferenceequipment vendor PictureTel Corp., the standard already &quot;is afew generations behind the latest technology.&quot;   The CCITT standard needs the equivalent of about fourphone lines to transmit images that don't blur if a confereemoves his head or gestures, PictureTel says. The companysells equipment using new compression algorithms that giveequal quality over two phone lines -- and soon will work onone phone line. Because the CCITT standard is alreadyobsolete, the company says, it was forced to turn to its ownproprietary algorithms, which aren't able to talk to othervendors' equipment cheaply.   Similarly, the International Standards Organization ismulling standards for PCs to process moving pictures, but thestandards aren't expected out until 1991 or later. IntelCorp. couldn't wait, and last year introduced a set of chipsusing a proprietary way to compress video images. Intel'schips can be programmed later to conform to standards.                                                                                                          Speeding Flow of Data   With Indium Phosphide                                                                                                          THERE'S ALWAYS a greed for speed among companies thattransmit information, whether it's over wires, airwaves orsatellites. Cable-TV concerns, for instance, will need fastertransmission speeds to send high-definition televisionchannels on fiber-optic cables.   The solution could come from a chip material called indiumphosphide, which is far faster than older materials andcreates half the electronic &quot;noise.&quot; The latest developmentcomes from Varian Associates Inc., which built anindium-phosphide chip with seven transistors that turns onand off 100 billion times a second. At that rate, the chipwill transmit and receive more than 50 times as muchinformation through optical fibers as today's silicon chips,which typically oscillate at fewer than two billion cycles asecond.   The Varian chip uses high-electron-mobility-transistortechnology (HEMT), which speeds up electrons by clearingimpurities out of their paths. Varian says the chips can bemade with standard chip-making equipment and could be on themarket in two years.   General Electric Co. expects indium-phosphide HEMTs to beused in direct-broadcast satellite systems that beam TVsignals down to plate-sized home satellite dishes. GeneralMotors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft Co. unit, which built anindium-phosphide transistor that oscillates 250 billion timesa second, expects auto companies to use the devices incollision-avoidance radar. TRW is developing such chips for&quot;smart&quot; weapons, such as missiles that use millimeter-waveradar to look through fog and recognize a target's shape.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          THE KEY to cheap chips is in squeezing more circuits ontothem. The average microprocessor chip unveiled at a recentinternational chip conference contained 580,000 transistors,up from 150,000 at 1987's conference. . . . Don't toss thatslow, aging fax machine: Electronic Modules Inc. has a new$499 device that lets an old fax machine scan documents, buttakes over the task of transmitting the image, sending a faxat speeds rivaling today's fastest machines.</TEXT></DOC>
