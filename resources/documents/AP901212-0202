After running into closed doors at several leading toycompanies, Gary Blankenship and Dorian Sandlin formed a merry, ifloose-knit, band of toymakers who are developing their ownproducts.   ``We try not to let the everyday drudgery of business,bookkeeping bring us down on our creativity. The main thing here isto have fun and create,'' Sandlin said.   Blankenship, 34, and Sandlin, 39, started talking toys when theymet in church two years ago. Blankenship asked Sandlin, acommercial artist, to design a package for a stuffed dog he'dcreated.   Sandlin then started pitching toy ideas of his own and last yearthey formed Yapco Toy Co., named for that first stuffed dog, Yappiethe Yuppie Pup.   The pair, who now operate out of a small office in Bedford,first achieved success with KidsFlex, which hospitals havepurchased to help develop the eye-hand coordination of therapypatients.   The toy is a crescent-shaped tube filled with water and a rubberball. Grips at both ends of the tube are squeezed to move the ballfrom one side to the other.   The toy is the lead product for Yapco, which is projecting morethan $1.5 million in sales next year. Blankenship and Sandlin saidthey are negotiating with a Japanese company to distribute KidsFlexthere.   To finance more creations, Blankenship and Sandlin startedhelping other inventors launch theirs. This year, they createdToyquest Inc. to provide other toy creators advice and help withpackaging, patenting and making a prototype.   Toyquest can develop simple toys, like card games, for as littleas $5,000, Sandlin said. More sophisticated toys, such aselectronics items, may take an investment 10 times that size.Initial inquiries are free.   ``We found ourselves in a situation where we go to toy companieswith an idea and they'd basically laugh you right out,'' Sandlinsaid.   ``We saw a market out there, friends of ours who had ideas, goodideas from good people out there. That's what we wanted to tap intoand hopefully make part of the Yapco line. That would help us andhelp them, too.''   Inventors have the option of joining Yapco's toy line, and manyhave. Blankenship and Sandlin and more than 30 of their clientswill unveil abot 50 products at the New York Toy Fair, theindustry's showcase event, in February.   ``It's pretty exciting once you've had an idea and you see itbeing exhibited in one of these shows. It's pretty spectacular,''Blankenship said.   ``Gary and Dorian really bring a quality agenda with Toyquest,''said Dale Brandon, a Cleveland-based toy consultant. ``There'splenty of room for champions to come along in this industry.''   Brandon, who founded a specialized toy retail chain, is one of26 people whom Blankenship and Sandlin turned to for advice andguidance. He believes the toy industry has suffered by squeezingout creative inventors such as them.   ``We're still propped up by Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles andsedentary video games,'' Brandon said.   About 30 percent of the sales by toy giant Mattel Inc. are itemsthat come from idea submissions outside of the company, said Mattelspokeswoman Donna Gibbs in Los Angeles.   Mattel's Magic Nursery doll was an inventor's idea and hasbecome one of the company's top-selling items this holiday, Ms.Gibbs said.   ``There's a stable of inventors that we stay pretty much inconstant contact with,'' Ms. Gibbs said. Those inventors usuallyhave previous experience in the toy industry, though, she said.   In addition to Yappie and KidsFlex, Yapco has developed a seriesof stuffed cats built around Cruising Charlie, who looks like agaudy tourist, several educational products, some board games and afew gag items.   Yapco already sells some of the items in specialty stores inCalifornia and Texas.</TEXT></DOC>
