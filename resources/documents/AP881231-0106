Gorbachev.   Elizardo Sanchez, president of a small, independent human rightsgroup here, proudly displayed to a reporter several copies of thespeech the Soviet president gave last month to the U.N. GeneralAssembly.   Sanchez said the Cuban press gave perfunctory treatment to thespeech, highlighting only passages that coincided with the officialview. Eager for a complete account, Sanchez obtained copies of thespeech from the Soviet Embassy.   Although his opinion can't be corroborated, Sanchez said hebelieves the government here felt uneasy about calling attention toa speech that once again underscored Soviet-Cuba differences duringthe Gorbachev era.   While playing down the Gorbachev speech, Cuba'sgovernment-controlled television provided full coverage of remarkslast month by Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister andnormally the leading villain in Cuba's pantheon of enemies. Bothaspoke on the recent agreement calling for the withdrawal of Cubanforces from Angola.   Gorbachev's speech was notably non-ideological in tone,contrasting sharply with President Fidel Castro's emphasis onrevolutionary purity. Marxist sloganeering was almost totally absentfrom the speech.   Sanchez, expressing a view shared by Western diplomats here, saidCastro is disquieted by Gorbachev's policy of open discussionbecause pressures for official candor could emerge in Cuba as well.   In his speech, Gorbachev said that given current internationalrealities, ``it is highly unlikely that closed societies can bepreserved.''   The comment could be taken as a slap at Cuba, with which theSoviets have been closely aligned for two decades.   Gorbachev also endorsed the principles of the U.N. Human RightsDeclaration, a document not held in high esteem by Cuban authoritiesbecause of its stress on civil liberties.   Cuba has always maintained that few countries do a better job offulfilling aspects of the declaration dealing with economic rights,including the right to employment.   No Latin American country employs a higher percentage of its workforce than Cuba, Castro maintains, insisting that any system thathas produced as much social progress as Cuba has in the past 30years should not be tampered with.   But Sanchez, who works out of a small, cramped office at hisHavana home, accused the government of violating at least 25provisions of the U.N. Declaration.   Dec. 10 was the 40th anniversary of the Human Rights Declaration,and this weekend is the 30th birthday of the triumph of Castro'srevolution.   It was on New Year's Day 1959 that Castro ousted a rightistdictatorship in a revolution remarkable for both its durability andthe magnitude of the changes it wrought.   Castro is expected to mark the anniversary with an appearanceSunday night in the east coast city of Santiago.   Until recently, independent human rights groups in Cuba have beenvirtually unknown. Now there are several, all of which Sanchezclaims are closely monitored by the government.   Sanchez, whose group is known as the Cuban Commission of HumanRights and National Reconciliation, said international pressure hasinduced the government to pay more heed to human rights issues.   As an example, he said there are no known cases of Cubanpolitical prisoners having been executed for at least two years.According to Western diplomats, more than 200 Cuban politicalprisoners have been released over the past year.   ``International public opinion is probably what most protectsus,'' Sanchez said.</TEXT></DOC>
