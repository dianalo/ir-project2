A twofold increase in lung cancerrisk was observed among male nonsmokers who lived in the study area.Risks were evaluated for all major lung cancer cell types, with the highestrisks observed for small cell carcinoma of the lung. Among cigarettesmokers, a slight, but not statistically significant, additional increasein risk was associated with residence in the study area. Among women,no significant elevations in risk were observed for persons who livedin the study area. The greatest increase in risk among women was forsmall cell carcinomas, but the elevations were not statistically significant.</TEXT></DOC>
