(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Ocron Inc.andM;PERCEIVE 1.0andM;Perceive 1.0 combines fairly accurate omnifont OCR methodology with across-mapping learn mode.andP;  Problem fonts, odd characters and symbols can allbe learned and stored in one or more trained font files.andP;  Font files can thenbe used singly or in combination with the omnifont mode to scan andaccurately recognize most conceivable fonts.andM;Perceive is also fast.andP;  On average, in PC Week Labs tests Perceive scannedand recognized text in less than 1 minute per page in omnifont mode and 1minute, 16 seconds, per page in learn mode.andP;  In omnifont mode, Perceive isalmost twice as fast as WordScan Plus and almost three times as fast asAccuScan.andM;The biggest difference between Perceive and the other products is its learnmode.andP;  Any well-defined font can be trained via the learn mode.andP;  While onlyone trained font can be used at a time, which makes it difficult to recognizedocuments with several odd fonts, a single trained font can be combined withthe omnifont mode, a combination of methodologies unique to this product.andM;Perceive works with a wide range of scanners, including units from AsukaTechnologies Inc., Advanced Vision Research Inc., Canon, Dest, HP, KyoceraUnison Inc., LightSpeed Technology, Logitech Inc., Marstek Inc., Microtek,Nisca Inc., Panasonic and Ricoh Corp.andM;Scanner setup options, which can be changed easily at any time, determineresolution, intensity in five degrees, paper size and a choice between lineart and halftones for scanning graphics.andP;  Perceive's limitation of fivedifferent intensity settings, while sufficient for most work, is not ascomprehensive as WordScan Plus' and AccuScan's ability to set intensityanywhere on a 100-point scale.andM;Text options include full or partial page, WYSIWYG or left-justified output;portrait or landscape orientation; and multiple page or automatic documentfeeder selections.andP;  Other setup options determine the relative tightness ofrecognition control, whether to display scanned images and text, and whetherto include recognition statistics at the end of the saved text file.andM;Recognition statistics with character and word count and the number ofprobable errors is a welcome feature, providing a quick way to determine therelative accuracy of a scan.andP;  Users can adjust the intensity or other factorsto try additional scans to measure comparative accuracy before the moretime-consuming job of proofreading.andM;Once an original is scanned and recognized, it can be edited from withinPerceive or captured to the Windows Clipboard for further editing orformatting.andP;  Perceive saves recognized text in a relatively limited number offormats: WordPerfect and WordandM;Star, as well as ANSI and ASCIIach with or without carriage returns at theend of each line.andM;Without automatic page decomposition, Perceive requires a somewhat awkwardworkaround.andP;  Full-page scanning reads, or attempts to read, everything on apage in the left-to-right order in which it's found.andP;  To maintain multipletext columns or to cut around graphics, however, the page can be scanned inpartial page mode, and then the operator can manually create boxes around thetext to be recognized.andM;The order the boxes to be scanned is determined by the order in which theboxes are created, although the order for scanning can be changed manually.andO;Drawing boxes around the text elements on the scanned page is time-consumingand sometimes awkward.andM;Perceive's omnifont mode is almost as accurate as that used by WordScan Plusand AccuScan, and the learn mode adds customization abilities that neither ofthe other products has.andP;  Training a font takes only 10 to 15 minutes, andafter training the saved font file works beautifully with documents that usethe same font.andM;Perceive is also faster than either of the other products.andP;  Other than aslightly less accurate omnifont mode, the only drawback to Perceive is itslack of automatic page decomposition.andM;A new version of Perceive is slated for shipment before the end of the year.andO;Company officials claim the new version will include improved omnifontrecognition and the addition of automatic page segmentation.andM;----------Ocron Inc.andM;Santa Clara, Calif.andM;(408) 980-8900andM;Privately heldandM;Year established: 1988andM;Number of employees: 21andM;Gross annual revenue: Not disclosedandM;Gross annual earnings: Not disclosedandM;OCR Systems Inc., publisher of ReadRight 2.01, a DOS-based optical characterrecognition (OCR) program, is set to release ReadRight for Windows 3.0 by theend of January.andM;The $595 package is an omnifont program that includes automatic pagedecomposition, format recognition and deferred recognition processing similarto that used by Calera Recognition Systems Inc.'s WordScan Plus.andP;  Included inthe program are built-in and user-customized dictionaries, and regiontemplates.andM;The product will work with a wide variety of desktop scanners as well as withhand-held scanners.andM;----------OCR Systems Inc.andM;Huntingdon Valley, Pa.andP;

 2.0, was released too late for inclusion in thisreview.andM;The package uses one or more type tables to recognize scanned text and hasthe ability to &quot;learn&quot; an unlimited number of new fonts for use.andM;Ten type tables come predefined with Read-it O..., but, as the manualsuggests, fonts will usually have to be learned using the program's learnmode.andP;  This process results in more accurate scans, but PC Week Labs found inlimited testing that learning a font for Read-it O...andP;  is much moretime-consuming and tedious than for Ocron Inc.'s Perceive 1.0.andM;Read-it O...andP;  also does not automatically decompose pages, requiring insteadthat text areas be boxed for separate recognition from graphics areas.andM;One of the $495 package's nicest features is its ability to save templates ofselected parts of documents for future use with identically formatteddocuments.andM;Unlike Read-it O...andP;

(HP) ScanJet Plus.andM;The OCR programs were tested with a wide variety of original print samples,from plain typed text to telephone book pages to magazine glossy reprints tostock listings.andP;  The reported scan and recognition times and accuracy countswere measured using several standard original print samples.andP;  All times wererounded to the nearest second.andP;  In all cases, if the scan and recognitiontiming tests required inserting new pages, adjusting scan area boxes, orother intermediate steps, the stopwatch was stopped while manual adjustmentswere made and started again with the appropriate keystroke or mouse command.andO;At the end of each scan the stopwatch was stopped when control was returnedto the user.andM;The scan and recognition times were taken from six different samples.andP;  Thefirst four samples were of single pages of text: a single-page, typed,257-word Courier 10-point letter; a 466-word laser-printed Courier 10-pitchprint sample; a 539-word IBM Proprinter dot-matrix Courier 10-point sample;and a 629-word Epson LQ-1000 dot-matrix Courier 10-point sample.andP;  PC WeekLabs also timed how long it took each program to scan and recognize the firstpage of a three-page press release and the time required to scan andrecognize all three pages.andM;All three programs tested use omnifont scanning technology, and each wastested that way.andM;Ocron Inc.'s Perceive 1.0, however, also possesses a learning mode.andP;  For eachof the test samples on which Perceive had one or more errors, Perceive wastrained in the font specific to the sample and then re-timed.andP;  Perceive'stimes using the trained fonts were somewhat longer than with the omnifontmode, but accuracy improved with the trained fonts.andM;Perceive was the fastest program at scanning and recognizing print samples,averaging 57 seconds per page in omnifont mode and 76 seconds per page withlearned fonts.andP;  Calera Recognition Systems Inc.'s WordScan Plus took anaverage of 1 minute 50 seconds per page and HP's AccuScan trailed at 2minutes 51 seconds average time per page.andM;Accuracy counts were taken on seven print samples: the four single-pagesamples and the three-page press release used for the timings; a 275-wordsingle-column article from the New York Times; and a 317-word two-columnarticle with a graphic from PC Week.andP;  With each program, software-controlledbrightness settings were adjusted to get the best possible accuracy from eachsample.andP;  Perceive was tested for accuracy both in its omnifont mode and withsample-specific trained fonts.andM;AccuScan was the most accurate omnifont OCR program, with only 15 errorstotal, 13 of which were from the PC Week article.andP;  WordScan Plus had 16errors scanning the article and seven others for a total of 23 errors.andO;Perceive did the poorest in omnifont mode, with 76 errors total, 46 from theIBM Proprinter dot-matrix print sample, 12 from the PC Week article andseveral from all samples except the laser-printed Courier 10-point sample.andM;Interestingly, Perceive's omnifont mode had the least number of errors withthe PC Week article .andP;  In learn mode, Perceive did an excellent job scanningall print samples but the PC Week article; with that test, there were toomany errors to even count.andP;  Otherwise, Perceive scored perfectly with trainedfonts, with only one error each in scanning the New York Times single-columnarticle and the three-page press release.andM;By Bruce Brown</TEXT></DOC>
