Then there was Meredith Vieira,cutting her hours and eventually being released from &quot;60 Minutes&quot; because sheis pregnant.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NORVILLE TAKES HER 'ONE CHANCE' TO BE WITHBABY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Television  </MEMO><TEXT>     Now comes Deborah Norville, leaving NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show to stay home for ayear with her baby, born in February.;    Ironically, Katie Couric, who wasnamed as Norville's successor Thursday, will be taking a two-month maternityleave of her own in mid-July.;    Norville, who joined NBC at its ownedaffiliate in Chicago in 1981, has had a stormy tenure as co-host on &quot;Today&quot;since she took over the job in January of last year.;    She replaced JanePauley in a network move widely perceived to be a betrayal of Pauley, and theshow's ratings plunged, leaving &quot;Today&quot; a runner-up to ABC's &quot;Good MorningAmerica.&quot;;    Norville became a media target as &quot;the other woman&quot; in theensuing flap. Last month, when she was pictured breast-feeding her baby inPeople magazine, she touched off another round of controversy.;    DuringCouric's substitute duties, &quot;Today&quot; show ratings slowly began to grow, andthey have been within a fraction of a point of &quot;Good Morning America&quot; for thepast four weeks.;    Norville, however, sought to make clear that leaving theshow was her own idea.;    &quot;During the past month away from my day-to-dayresponsibilities, I've had time to reflect on the tumultuous last year and ahalf,&quot; she said in a statement. &quot;Perhaps my personal situation -- being a newmother away from the spotlight -- has allowed me to see clearly what I want todo: give my son the best possible start on life and practice good journalism.;   &quot;There is plenty of time for the latter, but I'll get only one chance to dothe former.&quot;;    NBC officials refused to discuss contractual details ofNorville's departure, including whether or not she will remain on the payrollor be invited to return. A spokesman would say only that &quot;she continues tohave an arrangement with NBC News.&quot;;    Norville has proven herself a valuableprime-time asset. Two of her NBC specials, &quot;Kids and Sports: Taking the Risk,&quot;in December, and &quot;Sex, Buys and Advertising,&quot; in July, reaped high ratings.&quot;Bad Girls,&quot; broadcast in 1989, covering the increasing tendency of girls toturn to crime, remains the highest-ranked news documentary in televisionhistory.;    But does all that mean Norville will be welcome back on NBC?;   &quot;Barbara Walters could drop out of sight for a year and come back and nevermiss a beat,&quot; said Joe Foote, chairman of the Department of Radio-Televisionat Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and a specialist in the study ofthe &quot;visibility factor&quot; among television news correspondents. &quot;A star cansurvive.;    &quot;The question is, is Norville a star? Does she have thatcertified staying power? If she has that, a year away isn't going to hurt her.If she doesn't have that, she's in an insecure position.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Chicago Tribune  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910405  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  542  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday April 5, 199100096103,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
