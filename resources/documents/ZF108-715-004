(IRI), Metaphor Computer Systems Inc. in Mountain View, Calif., andMetapraxis Inc. in New York also are vying for attention.andM;EIS software is gaining acceptance.andP;  Clare Gillan, a senior analyst at IDC,expects revenue for U.S.andP;  suppliers to mushroom to $140 million by 1993.andM;One reason for the acceptance is that EIS suppliers are taking advantage ofrecent technical advances, especially the increasing power of microcomputers.andM;Universally, the programs support a simple user interface and provide topexecutives with a mouse and graphics to extract needed information.andM;LINKS FOR &quot;DRILL DOWN&quot;andM;Most programs store information in a proprietary, relational databasemanagement system (RDBMS).andP;  Initially, a user is presented summaryinformation, which can be further inspected by clicking on a mouse andproceeding to the next screen.andP;  This method of examining items is called&quot;drill down.&quot;andM;In most companies, data is generated by a variety of software programs andstored in a hodgepodge of locations.andP;  During the past few years, EISsuppliers have improved the links from their proprietary DBMS systems toother software programs so executives can &quot;drill down&quot; on different types ofdata.andM;Financial data often captures the attention of top management.andP;  Most EISprograms offer connections to leading financial software applications.andP;  Forinstance, Execucom's Executive Edge works with data from New York-based Dun andamp;Bradstreet Corporation's McCormack andamp; Dodge G/L applications.andM;In January 1989, Comshare and Management Science America Inc., Atlanta,announced a joint development agreement to merge MSA financial applicationsinto Comshare's Commander EIS package.andP;  (MSA's products have since beenfolded into the Dun andamp; Bradstreet offerings with McCormack andamp; Dodge.)andM;In March, Comshare announced a similar agreement with Ross Systems, a PaloAlto, Calif., vendor that specializes in financial applications that run onDigital Equipment Corp. VAX computers.andM;EIS software has also been connected to DSS programs.andP;  Information Resources,Inc. has structured its EIS package to work with the company's Express lineof DSS software.andP;  Execucom offers similar capabilities.andM;Links to various DBMS systems is another area of interest.andP;  Many corporationsare consolidating information from applications into a central RDBMS.andP;  Forinstance, Quaker Oats is in the process of loading all corporate data intoIBM's DB2 DBMS.andM;EIS vendors are working to improve their ability to access such information.andO;Pilot Executive Software offers a Structured Query Language (SQL) link fromits DBMS system to IBM's DB2, Redwood Shores, Calif.-based Oracle Corp.'sOracle, and Alameda, Calif.-based Ingres Inc.'s Ingres.andP;  Execucom's ExecutiveEdge works with IBM's DB2 and SQL/DS, DEC's RDB, and Oracle.andM;Electronic mail represents another area of integration.andP;  IDC's Gillan said,&quot;Leading suppliers must provide an interface from their EIS packages toelectronic mail software.&quot;andP;  Comshare supports links to IBM's Profs, and Pilotoffers connections to Profs and DEC's All-In-One.andM;Even with the enhancements, acceptance of the software within corporationstakes time.andP;  In the summer of 1988, Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Companyin Hartford decided to purchase EIS software.andM;The first user was Richard McGeary, the chief financial officer forinformation systems.andP;  &quot;The information services department was the guineapig,&quot; McGeary said.andP;  &quot;We didn't want to unleash any software on our usersthat we could not operate ourselves.&quot;andM;Connecticut Mutual Life chose Comshare's Commander package and is satisfiedwith the product, which runs on an IBM 3090 and PS/2s.andP;  But use of thesoftware spread slowly through the insurance company.andP;  Currently, 40 managerswork with Commander, and McGeary expects maybe 10 more users by the end ofthe year.andP;  &quot;Interest in the software is growing, but not at an exponentialrate,&quot; he said.andM;EIS, INTERNAL WATCHDOGandM;Most customers use EIS systems to monitor internal operations.andP;  For instance,NCNB Corp. has worked with Comshare's Commander for six months.andP;  Coggins saidthe initial applications are monitoring the bank's financial performance.andM;ACCESSING EXTERNAL DATAandM;But EIS software can do more than evaluate internal operations.andP;  Inleading-edge companies, executives use the software to keep an eye oncompetitors.andP;  These managers access external data and use it to gaugecompetitors' performance.andM;EIS software offers various mechanisms to gather external information.andP;  Themost prevalent technique is public database systems, and the most commonpublic database is news wire services, such as Dun andamp; Bradstreet's Dow JonesNews/Retrieval.andM;From these databases, executives gather news stories from publications, suchas the Wall Street Journal, concerning their competitors.andP;  The stories oftenprovide tips about competitors' strategic and product directions.andM;Other types of information are available.andP;  For instance, Pilot offers aconnection to Econbase, a database of economic information, such as themonthly U.S.andP;  trade deficit from Dialog Information Services Inc., Palo Alto,Calif.andP;  Observers expect use of such information to become more common ascompanies compete in foreign markets.andM;Currently, use of external database services is relatively low.andP;  Pullinginformation from a database takes time, and EIS software searches only onedatabase at a time.andM;To gather competitive information, executives may patiently wait for softwareto churn through various databases, and then discover there is no relevantinformation.andP;  &quot;Some executives are not willing to wait 60 seconds for thesoftware to complete its task,&quot; said Rubinow at Quaker Oats.andM;Also, desired information is often not available because the collection ofpertinent information varies by industry.andP;  Jeffrey Stamen, president of theDecision Support Systems Division at IRI, said that consumer markets have themost complete set of databases.andP;  Industries, such as retail, banking andmedicine, have little or no information sources.andM;Software companies rightfully claim that their products support connectionsto many sources of information.andP;  But present capabilities fall short of userrequirements.andP;  Rubinow said, &quot;Ideally, we want software linked to allinformation outlets, with the ability to sift though data and instantlypresent us with important items.&quot;andM;Although that goal is lofty, software vendors are taking steps to meetcustomer requirements.andP;  Users want simpler access to external data and betterintegration with internal applications.andP;  This wish list includes voice,image, video and text management applications.andM;Pioneer work has already been completed in some areas.andP;  Decision ResourcesCorporation, a consulting firm in Washington, has helped a few largecompanies integrate voice and image applications with their EIS software.andM;Lynette Ferrara, president of Decision Resources, said a manufacturingcompany incorporated voice annotation with its EIS software.andP;  &quot;An executivecan look at a document, make comments and send them to a co-worker,&quot; shesaid.andP;  &quot;Executives find that spoken messages are clearer and easier todeliver than written notes or memos.&quot;andM;Yet, not all observers see the benefit of integrating voice and EISapplications.andP;  &quot;I can't picture many executives sitting in their offices andtalking to their computers,&quot; said Stamen at IRI.andM;Imaging is an area with rich integration possibilities.andP;  &quot;Many companies havealready installed imaging applications, and EIS vendors must offerconnections to them,&quot; said Richard Crandall, president and chief executiveofficer of Comshare.andM;The number of applications is growing.andP;  For instance, a major bank presentspictures of job applicants along with resumes to managers filling variouspositions.andP;  Human resource management system (HRMS) applications includepictures of top executives with organizational charts so employees can seewhat a company president looks like.andM;DISPUTING THE VIDEO CONNECTIONandM;The need for links to video applications sparked disagreement among EISsuppliers.andP;  Mark Wood, Executive Edge product manager at Execucom, said, &quot;Thebenefits of support for video are obvious.andP;  Executives can watch programslike the Financial News Network in one window on their terminal.andP;  When achange in the company's stock price occurs, the executive can zoom foradditional information, and immediately formulate a strategy to cope with thechange.&quot;andM;Crandall disagreed, &quot;We haven't seen any interest in video applications fromour customers.&quot;andM;He added that integration with text management software is a low-priorityenhancement.andP;  &quot;Most customers are not aware of text management systemcapabilities,&quot; Crandall said.andP;  &quot;So, few are asking for links from oursoftware to text management systems.&quot;andM;Text management suppliers agree with that assessment.andP;  Barry Gross, directorof marketing at Verity Inc., a text management company in Mountain View,Calif., said, &quot;Customers are asking for links from our applications to SQLDBMS systems.andP;  Links to EIS systems may become a more important considerationin the future.&quot;andM;EIS suppliers are moving at different speeds to fulfill the vast wish list.andO;When this article was written, Pilot planned to announce a new product dubbedLightship.andP;  &quot;Our next application will integrate video, voice, imageprocessing, facsimile and graphics applications, such as maps,&quot; said DavidFriend, chairman and chief executive officer at Pilot.andP;  The software isscheduled to ship during the summer, and be generally available by the end of1990.andM;LINKS TO OUTSIDE SOURCESandM;Suppliers also plan to improve access to outside information sources.andO;Crandall said Comshare plans to take advantage of advances in publicdatabases.andP;  For instance, Dow Jones plans to use parallel processingcomputers to sift through information stored in its growing number ofdatabases.andM;&quot;When the new service is online, information will be collected from multiplesources and presented to executives in 10 seconds or less,&quot; Crandall claimed.andM;Such advances will help but not guarantee EIS acceptance.andP;  Texas Aandamp;M's McLeodsaid, &quot;Executives have their own management styles, and current packagescannot easily adapt to individuals' needs.&quot;andM;EIS systems require a great deal of customization.andP;  In many cases,corporations opt to build EIS applications from scratch, rather than tinkerwith leading packages.andP;  A 1989 IDC study found internal development at thetop of the list of customer purchasing intentions tied with Pilot Software'sproduct.andM;Thomas Gill, manager of financial information systems at Agway Inc., inSyracuse, N.Y., explained why the company built an EIS system.andM;&quot;EXPERT&quot; TAILORINGandM;&quot;Our business is a farm cooperative, so we are bit thrifty,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Thevarious EIS packages were expensive and could not be easily tailored to ourbusiness requirements.&quot;andM;Vendors are trying to make tailoring more simple, and have begun to bandy theterm &quot;expert system.&quot;andP;  Execucom claims that Executive Edge offers anartificial intelligence query language, so managers can easily access neededinformation.andM;IRI has delivered a few expert systems applications and plans to announcemore.andM;Observers expect EIS software to improve significantly during the next fewyears.andP;  &quot;The technology to add needed enhancements to current systems isavailable,&quot; said McLeod.andP;  &quot;The question is, How quickly can vendorsincorporate the technology into their products?&quot;andM;Estimates for adding capabilities, such as tighter integration with internalapplications and better connections to external information, ranged from twoto five years.andM;But the task may be endless.andP;  Ferrara at Decision Resources said, &quot;Topexecutives have an insatiable thirst for information, especially aboutmission-critical applications.andP;  As soon as vendors deliver new capabilities,executives ask for more and push suppliers into areas that we often do notanticipate.&quot;andM;Korzeniowski is a freelance writer based in Malden, Mass.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
