Chandra Shekhar has never held executive office, his innercircle lacks governing experience, and he is heading the weakestgovernment in India's 43-year history as an independent nation.   He was installed Saturday, three days after his breakawayfaction of the governing Janata Dal party helped bring down the11-month reign of V.P. Singh.   The changeover comes as India tries to recover from Hindu-Moslemrioting, separatist movements are tugging at its border states andinflation is driving millions beyond poverty into hunger with eachclimbing percentage point.   Chandra Shekhar's government is inherently unstable. His newlyformed Janata Dal (Socialist) party controls just 61 seats in thedecision-making lower house of Parliament.   It is propped up by the 195 seats of the Congress party led byformer Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who was Chandra Shekhar's swornenemy until they joined forces to unseat Singh.   Cynics say Gandhi will dump the new prime minister as soon as hebelieves he can win an election. ``This government will last aslong as Congress wants it to,'' Singh said.   Chandra Shekhar's immediate task is to grapple with thereligious and social conflicts that have claimed more than 500lives in two months and which ultimately undid the Singhgovernment.   Hindu fundamentalism has swept across India, promoted bymantra-chanting politicians preaching that Hinduism equalsnationalism and urging Hindus to stand up for majority rights.   Hindus make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people.   Riots erupted at the end of last month over a plan by Hindus tooverrun a Moslem mosque in the pilgrimage town of Ayodhya andreplace it with a temple. In two weeks more than 370 people werereported stabbed, shot or bludgeoned to death, and hundreds moredeaths may have gone unreported.   The Hindu-Moslem turbulence diverted attention from protests byupper-caste Hindus over Singh's policy to reserve nearly half ofgovernment jobs for low-caste Hindus. About 150 people, mostlyteen-agers, died in clashes with police or in dramatic suicideprotests.   The fires of caste and religion were stoked by politiciansbidding for votes among the enormous voting pool of India'sdowntrodden masses, where Chandra Shekhar also has traditionallyfound his support.   Separatist insurrections in border areas have escalated in thelast year. Lives are lost with such numbing regularity that dailynewspapers pay scant attention.   In Punjab, militants are seeking an independent state for Sikhs,who claim that the Hindus dominating the federal government arestealing their water and wealth from their northern farming state.   The separatist movement among one of India's traditionally mostloyal minorities has divided families and villages. At least 2,700people have been killed by Sikh extremists this year, making 1990their deadliest year since the insurrection began in 1983.   Moslems in Jammu and Kashmir, the only state where they are in amajority, also want to break away. The casualty toll there hassurpassed 1,500 since Indian forces cracked down this year.   India says both insurrections are being fed by arms and trainingfrom across the border in Pakistan, the nation which constitutesChandra Shekhar's biggest foreign policy challenge. Pakistan deniesaiding the separatists.   In the far eastern state of Assam, the United Liberation Frontof Asom has set up a virtual parallel state dominating thecountryside and extorting vast sums from managers of the rich teaplantations.   In the northwest part of Assam, Bodo tribesmen are fightinganother terrorist campaign for autonomy.   In the far south, 100,000 Tamil refugees have swamped India'sshores in flight from the guerrilla war in Sri Lanka across anarrow strait.   In the long run, Chandra Shekhar's government will stand or fallon the economy, the one issue which unites this diverse nationwhich is home to one of every six humans on earth.   Inflation officially is running at a projected rate of 10percent. But recent surveys show that in rural areas, the dailyfood basket has shot up by 25 percent since July.   About half the population - more than 400 million people - fallbelow the poverty line or hover just above it. Many familiescompensate for higher prices by cutting down on meals.</TEXT></DOC>
