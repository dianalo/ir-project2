The central issue in the National Labor Relations Boardcase, to be heard in Milwaukee, is whether the GLI HoldingCo. unit's bargaining tactics triggered the devastatingstrike by the Amalgamated Transit Union that began last March2 and forced the company to file for Chapter 11bankruptcy-law protection three months later.</LP><TEXT>   Greyhound is accused, among other things, of implementingits final contract proposal before reaching a bargainingimpasse, illegally firing strikers and condoning picket-lineviolence by supervisors, security personnel andstrike-breaking replacement drivers.   Greyhound officials, who have declined recent requests forinterviews, consistently have blamed the union for theviolence and have said they are confident of winning thecase, which they portray as a matter of legal technicalities.NLRB investigators, however, late last week filed a 93-pagedocument outlining dozens of alleged labor-law violations bythe company.   If any such violations are found to have caused thestrike, Greyhound could be forced to rehire hundreds ofstriking union members and pay them millions of dollars inback pay. Although the NLRB case and expected court appealscould drag on for years, the back-pay threat is alreadyhurting Greyhound's reorganization efforts.   Creditors fear that a huge union claim could substantiallyreduce what they receive in any reorganization. They haveasked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Richard S. Schmidt to estimateand to put a $40 million limit on the potential back payclaim and to reduce its priority so that most other creditorswould be paid first.   A decision against Greyhound by Judge Schmidt probablywould doom the reorganization plan it presented to creditorsin November. &quot;The issue is pivotal&quot; in the Chapter 11 case,said David Snodgrass, attorney for the Greyhound creditors'committee.   Because of the back-pay possibility, some creditorscontinue pressuring Greyhound to settle with the transitunion. Both sides met with a federal mediator last week, butno progress was reported. NLRB administrative law judgeRobert A. Giannasi has told both parties to providesettlement proposals.</TEXT></DOC>
