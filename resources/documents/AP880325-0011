Most mediacoverage was barred.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir met with U.S. Ambassador ThomasPickering to express his ``dissatisfaction'' about today'sscheduled meeting in the United States between Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz and two members of the PLO's legislative arm.   Also Friday, an Arab-American advocate of non-violent resistanceto occupation called for the establishment of a ``parallel''Palestinian government in Israel's occupied territories.   The army closed key areas of the occupied Gaza Strip and WestBank to the media, including the West Bank's Hebron area, where themost of Friday's violent clashes occurred.   In Washington, meanwhile, the State Department urged Americansto stay away from the West Bank and Gaza. Easter and Passover areapproaching, Christian and Jewish holidays that usually attracttourists to the Holy Land.   About 50 Israeli troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets intoHebron's Alia Hospital compound Friday to subdue about 100protesters who were hurling stones and bottles, hospital officialsand Arab reports said.   Later, soldiers stormed the hospital to arrest six Arab youthswho barricaded themselves on the roof, the army said.   Reporters saw troops surround Hebron's Al Haras mosque afterFriday's Moslem prayers, firing live ammunition and tear gas fromthe rooftops of nearby houses at several dozen stone-throwing Arabyouths on the mosque's roof.   Four Palestinians were wounded, hospital officials and Israelradio reported.   After a two-hour confrontation, soldiers stormed the mosque,yanked down Palestinian flags raised by the protesters and lined updozens of Arab teenagers against a wall. The army said 50 Arabswere arrested.   The army said it was forced to break in when the stone-throwersrefused to surrender. Television said it was the first timesoldiers had stormed a mosque since unrest began Dec. 8 in theterritories Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war.   Another Arab was wounded in the village of Idna, Israel Radiosaid.   In the village of Tarqumia near Hebron, troops killed twoPalestinians and wounded 13, witnesses and the radio said. The armysaid it was checking the reports but could not confirm them becauserelatives took the bodies.   Troops entered Tarqumia at about 4 a.m. and took over theschool, said Naim Odeh, a 52-year-old teacher. The army hasconverted a number of schools into military bases since the unrestbegan and is using about half a dozen as temporary detentioncenters.   ``Then about 500 youths marched out to the school and startedthrowing rocks and broken bottles,'' Odeh said in an interview.   Khaled Hassan Ahmed Murktan, 18, died of a gunshot wound to thestomach and Walid Abdul Fatatta, 18, was shot in the heart,villagers and Alia Hospital officials said.   Friday's fatalities brought to 111 the number of Palestinianskilled by U.N. count in the anti-occupation unrest since Dec. 8.One Israeli soldier has been killed.   Meanwhile, 72 percent of the Israelis questioned said they wantharsher measures in the occupied territories. The Dahaf nstitutepoll published in the daily Yediot Ahronot said 7 percent of the606 Israelis questioned this week supported less severe measureswhile 21 percent did not want policy changes.   Also, 49 percent of those questioned said Shultz' Middle Eastpeace plan _ essentially an exchange of land for piece with theArabs _ should be accepted. Forty-three percent were against it and8 percent had no opinion.   Israeli officials, however, reacted angrily to Shultz' plans todiscuss the peace initiative with two American citizens who belongto the Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile.   Shamir expressed his ``dissatisfaction'' during Friday's meetingwith Pickering, Israel TV said.   Shamir's spokesman Avi Pazner said Shultz's meeting with EdwardSaid, a professor at Columbia University, and Ibrahim Abu-Lughod, aNorthwestern University professor, violates a U.S. commitment notto talk to the Palestine Liberation Organization.   In another development, Mubarak Awad, an Arab-American advocateof non-violent resistance to Israeli occupation, called for forminga ``parallel'' government in the occupied territories.   ``We should start thinking what kind of a Palestinian state weare going to have, what to do with Jerusalem, where are theborders,'' he told Israel TV.   Israeli authorities confiscated Awad's U.S. passport and Israeliidentity card last year and ordered him expelled last November whenhis tourist visa expired. Awad stayed following strong U.S.pressure.</TEXT></DOC>
