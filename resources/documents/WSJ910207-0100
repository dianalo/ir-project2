The rally is &quot;very broadly based,&quot; says Dennis Trittin,senior vice president of Frank Russell Co., the Tacoma,Wash., keeper of the Russell 2000-stock index, which includesmany smaller issues. &quot;The market is moving toward smaller,more cyclical and financial stocks that have gotten hurt inthe last few years.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Some investors are beginning to embrace last year'scast-offs: financial stocks pummeled by worries about thebanking system, transportation issues whipped by spiralingoil prices, manufacturers of everything from heavy machineryto ice cream. Technology stocks continue to lead the charge,though some analysts now warn that their prices may beoverheating.   Even while over-the-counter stars still seize attention --Microsoft Corp. hurtled past the $100-a-share mark Tuesday --less glamorous issues such as Cincinnati Financial Corp., anOhio insurer, and State Street Boston Corp., a beaten-up NewEngland bank, have stretched past or toward new 52-week highsthis week. Yesterday, motor freight carrier Roadway ServicesInc. hit a new annual high of $48.50.   As stock buyers lighten up on the huge, safe stocks thatcarried them through last year's recession fears, they arecourting more economically sensitive companies that couldrebound if the government succeeds in its efforts tojump-start the economy, Mr. Trittin says. And small stocksseem a bargain, with the Russell 2000 index meadering alongaround 1.2 times book value as 1991 began, compared with 2.3times book for the stock market's largest 50 issues. &quot;Wehaven't seen a gap like that in ages,&quot; says Mr. Trittin.   Investors are hunting on the exchanges for neglected smallstocks, not just in the OTC market. Most popular have beenshares with a median stock market value, or capitalization,of about $500 million, according to Wilshire Associates Inc.of Santa Monica, Calif.   If you divide 2,500 representative stocks tracked byWilshire into fifths, the winning group lately, up 23% in thethree months through January, has been the second-largest 500stocks, those having a median market value of $490 million.Runner-up with a 22.3% rise was the middle fifth (medianvalue: $175 million). The largest group (median $2.2 billion)rose the least impressive 14.4%, while the smallest stocks(median $50 million) gained 19.2% for the period.   Traders say they are getting a whiff of speculative excessin some of the small-stock darlings in health-care,biotechnology and computer-related businesses. The riskiest,says Mr. Trittin, are health-care stocks, favorites both lastyear and this. &quot;Expectations of investors are so high forthose companies that they can't afford to disappoint&quot; whenthey report earnings, he says.   Some biotech stocks, which trade largely on expectationsrather than earnings, also may be poised to break hearts, headds. &quot;All it takes is for a product to be delayed or acompeting product to emerge&quot; -- then, look out below.   Technology issues also are getting dicey, says MorganStanley emerging growth analyst L. Keith Mullins. &quot;To put newcapital into some of these {stocks} that have run so much iscrazy,&quot; he says. Friday, Mr. Mullins advised his clients toavoid technology stocks for now and removed every singletechnology issue from his list of shares recommended forpurchase. If the group continues to rally, he says, he willrecommend investors sell their technology shares and not comeback into the market unless they drop at least 15%.   Investors also should be wary of some stocks in thebeleaguered groups now playing catch-up with the technologyleaders, money managers warn.   &quot;There are a good number of poorly run, undercapitalizedbanks and thrifts that I think will still go under,&quot; saysNick Adams, who manages the publicly traded First FinancialFund for Wellington Management Corp., Boston.   &quot;Stick to the quality {companies}, those with muchhigher-than-average capital ratios and lower-than-averagenonperforming loans and residential lending,&quot; he advises. Mr.Adams favors Westcorp Inc., a California thrift traded on theAmerican Stock Exchange, and NS Bancorp Inc., a Chicago-areathrift holding company that in December converted to stockownership from a mutual savings and loan.   Obscure stocks appeal to Richard Freeman, manager of theShearson Lehman Brothers Small Capitalization Fund of NewYork, up 43% in the three months through January. He ownsabout 200,000 shares of California Microwave Inc., aSunnyvale, Calif., supplier of satellite equipment. Withabout $16 a share in sales, he says, the stock is a bargainat yesterday's close of $9; he says he'll probably buy more.Advanced Polymer Systems Inc., a Redwood City, Calif., makerof drug-delivery systems, also is attractive to Mr. Freemanat yesterday's close of $3.50.   Some consumer stocks such as Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc.and Michael Foods Inc. are in the Montgomery Small Cap Fund,a Denver no-load mutual fund managed by Stuart Roberts.&quot;They're strong companies that have pulled back in price,&quot;says Mr. Roberts, who has been adding to his positions inthose stocks.   But Jack Granahan, co-manager of the Vanguard ExplorerFund, says: &quot;I'm not yet ready to move into cyclicals yet.&quot;He isn't sure the economy will recover as quickly as someexpect. He still focuses on companies able to sustain strongearnings growth. He favors OTC fast-grower SynOpticsCommunications Inc., and Cabletron Systems Inc. on the NewYork Stock Exchange. Both make equipment that links computerstogether.   Whether now is the time to move into cyclicals will dependgreatly on whether the Federal Reserve Board's moves tostimulate the economy translate into stronger growth forcompanies, says Frank Russell's Mr. Trittin. If investors seesigns that the Fed's move hasn't worked, then small stockswill fall and underperform the market again, he says.</TEXT></DOC>
