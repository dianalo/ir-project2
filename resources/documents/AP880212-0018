Shultz will go tothe Middle East in two weeks to try to promote two-stagenegotiations between Israel and Jordan on Palestinian self-rule.   A brief State Department announcement Friday said Shultz wouldmake the trip at the end of the month ``for the purpose ofadvancing the Middle East peace process.''   Other U.S. officials said he would set out for the Middle Eastabout 24 hours after returning from Feb. 21-23 talks in Mosocw andvisit Egypt, Jordan, Israel and possibly Saudi Arabia.   Shultz plans to remain in the area until he joins PresidentReagan for a summit meeting with the leaders of the 15 NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization countries in Brussels beginning March2.   The Soviets have been notified in advance that Shultz intends tosound out Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze about aninternational peace conference that would be a backdrop forArab-Israeli negotiations.   Their Moscow talks will center mostly on prospects for a treatyto sharply reduce U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear missiles andfor a withdrawal of the Red Army from Afghanistan after anoccupation of more than eight years.   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Shultz have registeredtheir reluctance to having the Soviets play a prominent role in aMiddle East settlement. But Jordan's King Hussein wants theparticipation of all the big powers, including Moscow.   According to U.S. and other sources who declined to beidentified, Shultz will advance a two-step plan that would opennegotiations in April between Israel and a mixedJordanian-Palestinian delegation and then resume in December towork on an overall Middle East settlement.   All options, including statehood for the Palestinians, would beopen at that point.   Shultz reaffirmed Monday night in a meeting with Americanforeign policy experts that the U.S. approach to a final settlementis based on Israel trading territory for peace.   That could cause severe political problems for Shamir becausemany of his supporters are against relinquishing land the Arabslost to Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War.   At the same time, the United States has not endorsed Palestinianstatehood. President Reagan's formula, outlined in a 1982 speechand still U.S. policy, proposed linking the West Bank and Gaza toJordan.   Reagan said flatly that the United States ``will not support theestablishment of an independent Palestinian state'' in theterritories and would also ``not support annexation or permanentcontrol by Israel.''   Shultz's trip is designed to show a commitment to aiding the 1.5million Palestinian Arabs who live on the West Bank and in Gaza andto ending violence in the Israeli-held territories.   Sources said Shultz's overriding goal was to promotenegotiations between Israel and the Arabs, possibly in theframework of a Mideast peace conference.   They stressed that the framework was incidental to holdingdirect talks on the Palestinian issue and that all approaches togetting the two sides to the table would be considered.   The peace conference idea has drawn objections from Shamir, butit has the support of Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, andpossibly King Hussein.   On his last visit to the region in October, Shultz said heunderstood why Shamir would be reluctant to hold negotations in away that gave the Soviet Union a chance to play an influential role.   The Soviets generally side with the Arabs in their dispute withIsrael and do not have diplomatic relations with Jerusalem.   About 96 percent of the residents of the West Bank and Gaza arePalestinian Arabs. Jewish settlers who were banned from the WestBank during Jordan's control from 1948 to 1967 have establishedvillages, religious schools and synagogues there.   Hussein has accused the Reagan administration of beinghopelessly one-sided toward Israel. But a recent U.S. diplomaticemissary, Philip C. Habib, was reported to have detected a``positive'' attitude in talks with the king in Amman.   Assistant Secretary of State Richard W. Murphy returned from theMiddle East on Thursday and reported to Shultz on his meetings withleaders of Syria, Saudia Arabia, Egypt and Israel, as well as withBritish and French officials.</TEXT></DOC>
