The two central banks intervened to stem the upward tideof the dollar after it rose above 128 yen. The dollar's risedidn't reflect economic fundamentals, a Bank of Japanofficial said after confirming the intervention.</LP><TEXT>   That left the dollar to trade relatively tightly inEurope, with speculator interest curbed by fear of furtherintervention should the dollar rise and by the absence of NewYork trading due to the Presidents' Day holiday in the U.S.   The intervention knocked the dollar down to just below126.50 yen and 1.6077 marks. By late afternoon, however, thedollar had regained some poise and was quoted in Europe at1.6225 marks, down from 1.6285 marks late Friday, and at126.95 yen, down from 127.90 yen.   Traders said that the thin European trading couldn't beused to gauge the likely direction of the dollar. However,the bounce higher following intervention seems to indicatethat the market is demanding dollars, some observers said,although they remained shy of pre-intervention levels.   Late Friday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6260marks, up from 1.6241 marks late Thursday. The U.S. currencyalso was changing hands at 127.90 yen, up from 127.65 yen.Sterling was trading unchanged at $1.7715.   In early trading Tuesday in Tokyo, the dollar was at128.10 yen, up from 126.93 yen at Monday's close in Tokyo.The U.S. currency also was trading at 1.6257 marks, up from1.6104 marks Monday.   The dollar's rise in Friday's trading in New York cameafter bullish market sentiment lifted the currency out of aslump caused by poorer-than-expected U.S. economic data.   The dollar fell to its intraday low of 1.6138 marks onnews that U.S. industrial output fell a seasonally adjusted0.9% in January, compared with expectations of a 0.5% gain.But players then rushed in to buy dollars, which caused thecurrency to shoot up to its intraday high of 1.6360 marks.   The dollar's gains completely eroded the losses thatoccurred after release of the industrial production data,which also showed a revised decline of 0.4% in December,compared with previously estimated 0.2% fall. The dollar wastrading at 1.6223 marks just ahead of the data's release.   Earlier in the day, the dollar had traded lower on newsthat U.S. producer prices of finished goods fell a seasonallyadjusted 0.3% in January, compared with an expected declineof 0.1%. The latest figure compared with a revised decline of0.1% in December, which had earlier been estimated as down0.2%.   The dollar, meanwhile, moved little against the Japanesecurrency. Fears of central bank intervention continued tokeep the dollar stuck in a narrow trading range against theyen.   Dealers recently have been reluctant to trade the dollarabove 128 yen, a level it reached briefly on Fridayafternoon.   Traders were reminded of the possibility that centralbanks might act to stem the dollar's rise against the yen bythe comments of several Japanese monetary officials.   Japanese Finance Minister Tsutomu Hata said foreignexchange levels were at a &quot;delicate point,&quot; and added thatthe Group of Seven leading industrial nations would keep inclose contact and respond appropriately. The G-7 concluded attheir Jan. 25 meeting that currency levels at that time werein line with underlying fundamentals. The dollar was thentrading around 123-124 yen.   Mr. Hata indicated that the dollar recently hadstrengthened too much against the yen and said the impact ofthis rise on Japan's trade surplus with the U.S. would bewatched carefully.   And Japan's Kyodo News Service quoted a senior JapaneseFinance Ministry official as saying there would becoordinated intervention in currency markets if the dollarrose &quot;another step.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
