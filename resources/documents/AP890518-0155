Nonetheless, the three men with whom Bush met _ ArchbishopDesmond Tutu, the Rev. Allan Boesak and the Rev. Beyers Naude _said they were impressed that Bush showed an open attitude to theirconcerns.   Tutu, who heads the Anglican Church in South Africa, wascomplimentary of Bush's attitude and expressed hopes for progresswith his administration.   ``I think there is a very warm openness and we think the doorstands ajar. No door has been slammed in our face,'' Tutu saidafter the 20-minute meeting, also attended by presidential Chief ofStaff John Sununu and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesdaythat Bush continues to view additional sanctions against theminority white government of South Africa as ``counterproductive.''   Tutu and his colleagues contrasted Bush's attitude to that ofhis predecessor, Ronald Reagan.   Once Reagan opposed economic sanctions against South Africa,Boesak said, anti-apartheid activists felt ``there was no furtherpossibility of even discussing the issue.''   Reagan vetoed the sanctions but Congress overrode him. Theybanned new U.S. investment in South Africa; barred imports of SouthAfrican coal, steel, uranium and textiles, and prohibited SouthAfrican airliners from landing in the United States.   Tutu said after meeting with Bush that he had urged thepresident to ``take the moral leadership'' toward ending apartheid.   ``We do not want to be overly optimistic,'' Tutu told reporters.But he said he was impressed that Bush wanted to be ``a catalystfor change'' and ``a positive influence.''   Boesak added, ``The very fact that he values the opinion ofthose of us who represent black people in South Africa, that initself is a sign that we did not get in the same measure from theprevious administration.''   Tutu said there were no specific indications of a change awayfrom Reagan administration policies. ``But the way we werereceived, the fact that we were received'' was a hopeful sign.   The archbishop said the three asked Bush to urge the Pretoriagovernment to negotiate with representatives of the South Africanblack majority.   Boesak spoke to Bush about the need to give hope to young SouthAfricans, ``and that touched a responsive cord,'' Tutu said.   ``We said we wanted the United States ... to take the moralleadership of the world in helping to end apartheid and bringingthe South African government to the negotiating table,'' thearchbishop said.   To that end, Bush and Congress should support new economic anddiplomatic sanctions intended to pressure financially strappedSouth Africa, the group told a news conference.   Boesak said the most effective sanctions would target the SouthAfrican coal, oil and gold-mining industries.   The three clergymen said they did not specifically discusssanctions with Bush, but do hope to have further talks with hisadministration.   Speaking for the administration, Fitzwater said that officials``will be looking at ways to best use American pressure, influenceand leverage to bring about justice and equality to South Africa.''   Fitzwater said that the president ``shares the archbishop'sabhorrence of apartheid'' and had ``promised to stress hisopposition'' to apartheid ``in every way possible.''   Meeting with reporters a day earlier, Fitzwater said Bush seesfurther sanctions as ``counterproductive.''   Fitzwater said after Thursday's meeting that Bush had issued aninvitation to Albertina Sisulu, one of the leaders of the UnitedDemocatic Front in South Africa, to visit the United States.   She is ``restricted'' in her homeland, meaning she cannot speakat public rallies or be quoted in news accounts. State Departmentofficials denied the invitation was an attempt to provoke Pretoriato give her a passport.   The Thursday meeting came as U.S. officials prepared for thevisit of F.W. de Klerk, who is expected to succeed P.W. Botha aspresident of South Africa after Botha resigns in September. DeKlerk would be the first top South African leader to officiallyvisit here in 30 years.   Anti-apartheid leaders are looking to De Klerk's ascendancy,along with the new administration in Washington, as a window ofopportunity for change. De Klerk has called for political reforms,but opposes complete enfranchisement for blacks, who comprise 85percent of the nation's population.</TEXT></DOC>
