Under the arrangement, American will acquire 50 757s with anoption to purchase 50 more. American Chairman Robert Crandall wouldnot disclose a dollar amount, but analysts have said the order isworth up to $4.2 billion.   American will take delivery of the planes starting in 1989. Theyare primarily designed as replacement airplanes for the aging 737sand 727s in American's fleet.   The 194-passenger 757 jetliner, with a range of about 3,200miles, burns 25 percent less fuel than comparable aircraft and willbe powered by two Rolls Royce engines.   ``Overall, this is a transaction that gives American, onexcellent terms, a highly efficient new airplane that can make ourfleet more efficient and productive and allow us to save trulyimpressive sums of money in the years ahead,'' Crandall told a newsconference here.   Analysts have said Seattle-based Boeing Co. could break previousrecords in 1988, a decade after the aerospace giant introduced thetwin-engine jetliner. So far this year, Boeing has had 276 aircraftordered, compared with just 88 ordered at this time last year.   The New York Times, meanwhile, reported that Allegis Corp., theparent of United Airlines, was considering ordering as many as 60of the 757s, worth an estimated $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion.   Allegis spokesman Joe Hopkins in Chicago would neither confirmnor deny such an order was pending, or say whether Allegis wasnegotiating with Boeing. ``We simply don't comment on rumors likethat,'' Hopkins said Tuesday.   So far this year, Boeing has received orders for 40 757s. Fromthe time Boeing announced development of the plane in 1978 throughthe end of 1987, just 239 of the planes had been ordered.   ``It was just a matter of time before the 757 would grow intoits time,'' analyst David Smith of Robert Elsworth and Co. inWashington, D.C., said Tuesday.   The company's previous largest order was just last week, a $4.6billion deal for 100 planes being purchased by International LeaseFinance Corp. of Beverly Hills, Calif.   Even with the possibility of 160 additional orders, Boeingspokesman Jack Gamble said Boeing had no immediate plans to addworkers to its 757 production line at Renton, Wash., or to increaseoutput from the current four 757s a month. The line has a capacityof about seven planes a month, Gamble said.   Any large orders would lengthen the life of the production runand stabilize work schedules, he said.   Orders are indicators of future business for Boeing, since thecompany isn't paid by customers until planes are delivered.   Paul Nisbet, aerospace analyst at Prudential-Bache SecuritiesInc. in New York, said the American order means the time has comefor an aircraft program ``that was the fly in the ointment'' forBoeing, he said.   New orders, he said, may turn ``what has been a continuous-lossprogram into what will be a continuous full-production line.''   Nisbet said the large International Lease order and rush ofinterest in the 757 may be the start of a bonanza year for Boeing.``It may encourage everyone to hurry up and get their place inline,'' he said, if they want new aircraft delivered before themid-1990s.   Boeing had a record $20.2 billion in commercial jet orders for1987, but Nisbet said 1988 could see orders reaching $25 billion.   Boeing intended the 757, which first flew in 1982, as theeventual replacement for the aging 727 tri-jet, which went intoservice in 1964.   The new plane is quieter than a 727, far more fuel-efficient,features a computerized cockpit and can be flown by a crew of two,instead of three. It also costs $41 million to $47 million, whichanalysts say was enough to scare away new buyers when the price ofoil fell in the early 1980s.   ``When fuel went down, it became feasible to operate 727s withthree pilots and big gas-eating engines,'' said William Whitlow,analyst for Dain Bosworth Inc. in Seattle.   ``There was not a need to replace 727s that were fully writtenoff as far as costs were concerned as long as fuel costs werelow,'' Nisbet said. ``But maybe we're seeing that 20-year-oldairplanes are not worth flying'' because of higher maintenance,fuel and crew costs.   Both Whitlow and Nisbet said that with airports becoming morecongested, the 757 is attractive because of its passenger capacity.And Nisbet noted that ``if you want an airplane delivered before1991'' in the small- to mid-size range, the 757 is the one to pick,since McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s MD-80, Airbus Industrie's A320 andBoeing's smaller 737 series ``are all pretty well booked.''   Boeing does not release profit or loss figures on individualprograms. But Smith, Nisbet and Whitlow all said a new round ofmajor orders should be enough to make the 757 a money-maker.</TEXT></DOC>
