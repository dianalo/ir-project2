The UAW quickly rejected the notion, saying that it hadn'tmade a final offer in the four-month-old dispute. It alsoaccused the company of using &quot;union-busting tactics.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Although the construction-equipment maker wouldn'telaborate on its statement, labor experts said the companycould be paving the way for inviting strikers back to workand imposing the &quot;final&quot; contract offer it made last month.It could also try to hire replacement workers, though thatwould sharply escalate the conflict.   Caterpillar's action also raises the possibility that theunion could expand its walkout. Some 3,800 of its membersremain on the job at various plants, and 800 have been laidoff as a result of the dispute.   The UAW seeks a &quot;pattern&quot; agreement similar to one itnegotiated at Deere andamp; Co., of Moline, Ill. But Caterpillarmaintains it couldn't stay &quot;globally competitive&quot; with suchan agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
