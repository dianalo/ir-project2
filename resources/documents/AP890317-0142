But the trialmay never take place because detectives lied to obtain a searchwarrant.   On Monday, Suffolk Superior Court Judge Charles Grabau isscheduled to hold a hearing to decide whether Albert Lewin, 33, willbe charged in the shooting of a Boston detective during a raid on adrug dealer's apartment 13 months ago.   The detective, 36-year-old Sherman Griffiths, was felled by abullet that pierced the apartment's steel-reinforced door as membersof Boston's elite anti-drug task force prepared to break it down.   Grabau dismissed the original charges against Lewin two weeks agoafter detectives failed to produce a potential defense witness, theinformant who supposedly led them to the apartment where theshooting took place.   In a remarkable turnabout in their story, the three detectives,under pressure from the prosecutor, filed affidavits Mondayadmitting that the informant they called ``John'' never existed.   Assistant District Attorney Francis O'Meara, in asking Grabau tochange his mind and reinstate the charges, said he will argue Mondaythat the evidence against Lewin is so overwhelming that themisconduct by police should not block the prosecution.   By the time the officers finally got into the apartment, thekiller had fled down a back stairway. But the evidence that Lewinhad been in the apartment is strong, said O'Meara.   ``I've got his fingerprints in there, I've got his clothes in thecloset, I've got his cigarettes, I've got his foot powder. I've evengot the piece of chicken that he was eating 20 minutes before theraid,'' O'Meara said.   Lewin's defense attorney, Max Stern, contends that thedetectives' misconduct has permanently prevented his client fromgetting a fair trial.   ``The critical witnesses, the police officers themselves, havecompletely trumped themselves and the (prosecution's) case by theirmassive and repeated perjury in the case, which they now admit to,''Stern said. ``They have lied so many times now that there's no wayto put any faith in the reliability of anything they say.''   According to the affidavit filed by the detectives to obtain asearch warrant, an informant named John told them that a 5-foot,6-inch Hispanic drug dealer named Stevie was selling cocaine fromthe apartment.   From the beginning, a key hole in the prosecution's case has beenthat Lewin, who is 6-foot-2 and Jamaican, clearly does not fit thatdescription. As a result, defense attorneys requested last year thatpolice produce John as a witness. But the detectives said they couldnot find him.   Under pressure from the district attorney's office, which isinvestigating them for possible perjury, Detectives Carlos A. Luna,Hugo R. Amate and Paul G. Schroeder filed affidavits this weekchanging their story. Mark Sullivan, Luna's attorney, said the menadmitted that ``John'' was not a real person, but a composite of twoinformants.   Christopher Muse, attorney for Amate and Schroeder, says thedetectives decided to come forward, even though they may beimplicating themselves for perjury, because they ``want to seejustice done'' in the murder of their partner.   Prosecutors say they now believe that the real informant was notJohn, but someone else, and that ``Stevie'' was merely a stockdescription of a typical Boston drug dealer.   Even though his case may be blown apart by the detectives'admission that they lied, O'Meara said he does not judge themharshly.   He said intense pressure from Boston's political leaders andsociety as a whole to crack down on drug dealers ``forces good anddecent young police officers into the ethical dilemma: `Should I doit right and not get it done? Or should I do it a little wrong, butget it done?'''</TEXT></DOC>
