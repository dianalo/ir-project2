The first-quarter price increase, down slightly from a 2 percentpace in the final three months of 1988, would represent a 7 percentannual inflation rate if sustained for a full year, the LaborDepartment said.   On the export side, meanwhile, prices for U.S. goods soldoverseas rose 1.4 percent in the last quarter after declining 0.3percent in the preceding three months. The increase, whichreflected higher prices for exports of food, fuels and crudematerials, would translate into a 5.7 percent annual inflation rate.   The quarterly figures are not adjusted to remove seasonalfactors.   Economist Nigel Gault of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,Mass., said the price increases for both exports and imports were``consistent with the fact that the industrialized nations as awhole are getting close to full capacity'' in industrialproduction, a condition that can create shortages and bottlenecksthat drive up prices.   The January through March increase in import prices wasprimarily due to an 18.3 percent jump in prices for imported fuels.The fuels increase was led by a 27.8 percent surge in prices forimported crude oil that followed a November production accord bythe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   Despite the first-quarter increase in fuel costs, average pricesfor imported fuels still were one-third below their 1985 levels.   Excluding fuels, import prices rose a modest 0.5 percent duringthe first quarter after climbing 2.4 percent in the previousquarter. The advance in prices for non-energy imports was held downin part by the appreciation of the U.S. dollar during the period,the Labor Department said.   The dollar's value increased 3.2 percent last quarter afterfalling 4.9 percent in the preceding quarter, according to atrade-weighted index used by the department. The index now is 2.1percent higher than it was in March 1988.   On the export side, prices for food sold abroad rose 2.5 percentlast quarter after declining 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of1988. The grain index, which reflects prices for roughly one-halfof U.S. food exports, rose 5.9 percent in the first quarter afterfalling 6 percent in the final three months of 1988.   Since March 1988, the grain index has risen 35.3 percent, mainlydue to last summer's drought.   Prices for crude material exports rose 4.9 percent last quarter;prices for fuel exports advanced 2.9 percent.   For a year, the Federal Reserve Board has been pushing upinterest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and keepinflation in check.   But Gault said it will take some time ``for the tightening ofmonetary policy in the U.S. and in other industrialized countriesto slow down the economies enough to have a significant impact onthe inflation rate.''   For the 12-month period that ended in March, import prices rose5.1 percent while export prices advanced 6.3 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
