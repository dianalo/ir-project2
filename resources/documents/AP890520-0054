Thousands of riot troopers in combat fatigues and black helmetsflooded central Seoul, conducting street checks for radicalsupporters and guarding key government buildings.   Police charged hundreds of protesters who tried to block streetsand chant anti-government slogans in the city center. Strugglingprotesters were taken away on buses. Police said more than 1,000people were arrested.   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Drive out the Yankees!''protesters yelled.   About 120 students courted arrest by laying down in one mainstreet with their arms and legs interlocked. Police hauled thestudents away as other protesters screamed abuse, but there were noclashes.   Riot police also blocked protests in the rural cities of Chonju,Sungnam and Taegu. Small protest marches were allowed in eightother cities after organizers obtained police permission.   The United National Democratic Movement, the nation's maindissident alliance, had called for a major protest in Seoul to pushfor President Roh's downfall and to mark the anniversary of a May,1980, uprising in the southern city of Kwangju.   The movement issued a statement denouncing the government forblocking the rally and said police had violated political rights.Even after the rally was blocked, protesters tried to demonstratein the city center.   Eight radical students armed with iron bars tried to attack theSeoul headquarters of the Joint Investigation Team, which has beenspearheading a major crackdown on the dissident movement. Guardsstopped the students and seized two of them while the others fled,police said.   Police said four students briefly occupied a governmentprosecutor's office in Suwon near Seoul before being overpoweredand arrested.   Police banned the Seoul rally on grounds it was a threat topublic order, and thousands of riot police ringed the street whereit was to have been held. They stopped and questioned people whoapproached the area, taking many into custody.   Troopers in the downtown area also stopped and questionedpeople, asking to see identity cards and checking bags for weaponsand anti-government leaflets. Suspects were bundled onto policebuses and taken away for questioning.   Hundreds of riot police guarded key government buildings and theU.S. Embassy.   In other protests, about 500 people marched in Kwangju to callfor Roh's fall. The march was blocked by about 2,000 riot police inthe city's main square, and the protesters hurled eggs and rocks attroopers.   The Kwangju protest was the smallest since daily protests beganMay 11 to mark the anniversary's uprising. Crowds estimated at upto 100,000 took part in protests there last week.   Dissidents have mounted a series of violent anti-governmentprotests and labor strikes in recent months to call for theoverthrow of the Roh. But the dissidents lack popular supportbecause of their violent tactics and extreme views.   Roh, a former general, won a presidential election in late 1987and has introduced broad democratic reforms, but dissidents claimhe is a front for military rule.   One of the dissidents' demands is expulsion of the 43,000 U.S.troops based in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty. Theycontend the soldiers hamper reunification with communist NorthKorea.   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the peninsula wasdivided at the end of World War II. The two sides fought the KoreanWar in 1950-53.</TEXT></DOC>
