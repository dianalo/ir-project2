A semi-classical method to extract spectral informationfrom the generated trajectories is used to calculate transition intensitiesand frequencies for the coupled quantum mechanical transitions. The nuclearterm describes a deformed heavy nucleus with potential well parametersbased on the recent work by Sharon and Naumann, it sufficiently treatscollective nuclear rotational motion lower in frequency than in the singleparticle nucleon model. We reported on the dynamics of this model inthe presence of a laser field; a problem of interest in laser-drivennuclear excitation. 15 refs., 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
