In light of the problems encountered by other banks, there hasbeen widespread speculation that Wells Fargo would be forced to makesubstantial new provisions for deteriorating real estate loans.;   Relievedinvestors pushed the stock higher after the financial report was releasedTuesday. Wells Fargo shares jumped $3.88 to close at $71.25 in trading on theNew York Stock Exchange.;   In an unusual statement, however, the bank warnedthat additional reserves still may be required. &quot;No assurance can be giventhat subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of factors thenprevailing, including economic conditions and the company's ongoingexamination process and that of its regulators, will not require significantincreases in the allowance for loan losses,&quot; the bank said.;   Althoughinvestors reacted positively, the bank's earnings fell below the estimates ofmost analysts.;   The report showed that interest income for the quarterincreased to $637 million from $590 million a year ago, primarily because ofloans added to the portfolio through the acquisition of Great America Bank andseveral smaller banks. Non-interest income also increased, to $224 millioncompared with $195 million a year ago, as a result of greater emphasis oncustomer services that generate fees.;   The bank's expenses also increased,however, due to the cost of operating foreclosed real estate, higher premiumsfor deposit insurance and additional amortization related to theacquisitions.;   The bank's loans increased 4 percent to $46 billion from$44.1 billion a year ago but fell 3 percent from the prior quarter. Aspokeswoman said the bank was seeing fewer qualified borrowers as a result ofcurrent economic conditions and was not making new loans as quickly as currentloans were being paid off.;   Wells Fargo reported anemic results on two keymeasures of bank performance. Its return on average assets fell to 0.62percent from 1.26 percent a year ago. The bank's return on average equitydropped to 10.62 percent from 21.93 percent a year ago.;   Nevertheless, theresults show the bank is operating &quot;very efficiently&quot; and is in a position tobenefit strongly from economic recovery, said Campbell Chaney of Sutro andamp; Co.in San Francisco.;   Wells Fargo operates the country's 10th-largest bank andthe state's third-largest bank based on total assets.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RON WOLF, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911016  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  464  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, October 16, 199100290009,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
