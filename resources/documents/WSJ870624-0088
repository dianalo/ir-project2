TransCanada previously reported first-quarter net income of 43.3 million dollars, or 26 cents a share.    In addition, TransCanada said the decision will reduce earnings for all 1986 by about 8.5 million dollars, or eight cents a share. TransCanada earned 60.6 million dollars, or 16 cents a share, in 1986 after write-downs of 114.5 million dollars.    As previously reported, the energy board cut TransCanada's rate of return for part of last year and set a return for 1987 that was lower than the company had requested.    Separately, TransCanada began offering 100 million dollars of 10.8% debentures due 2002. Proceeds will be used to repay bank debt incurred to finance its pipeline operations.
