The overburden-to-coal ratio will increase to 6:1 and later,when the so-called deep seams have to be opened-up, to 8-10:1. Browncoal is used mainly for the generation of electricity and for briquetting.About 20% of the briquettes are supplied to upgrading plants, where theyare used inter alia to produce metallurgical (brown coal high-temperature)char and low-temperature carbonization products. In the open-cast mines50% of the overburden is removed with the aid of overburden conveyingbridges, a method which has economic advantages compared to the benchconveying technology. A further development of the direct transport technologyhas been achieved by the introduction of so-called combined direct overcastingmethods.</TEXT></DOC>
