The losses had been expected since the Canadian government announced last week new guidelines for bank reserves against loans to 34 less-developed countries. The government ordered banks to increase reserves to between 30% and 40% of their 25 billion Canadian dollars ($19 billion) in loans to the countries. Previously, the banks had reserves representing about 15% of the loans.    Royal Bank, Canada's largest, reported a one-time charge of 800 million dollars after it increased loan-loss reserves by 1.4 billion dollars during its fiscal third quarter. After the charge, Royal Bank reported a net loss of 629.9 million dollars for the quarter and a nine-month net loss of 400 million dollars.    For the year-earlier third quarter, Royal Bank reported a profit of 111.9 million dollars, or 89 cents a share, and for the nine months a profit of 377.5 million dollars, or 3.16 dollars a share.    Bank of Montreal, the country's second-largest bank, had previously announced it would report a special charge of 753 million dollars for the quarter after it increased reserves by 1.28 billion dollars. Yesterday, the bank reported a net loss of 615.2 million dollars for its fiscal third quarter and 449.2 million dollars for the nine months after the charge.    Bank of Montreal reported a profit of 88.3 million dollars, or 92 cents a share, for the year-earlier quarter and 271.8 million dollars, or 2.87 dollars a share, for the first nine months of fiscal 1986.    Bank of Nova Scotia, the country's fourth-largest bank, reported a one-time charge of 692.9 million dollars for its fiscal third quarter, after increasing reserves by 1.17 billion dollars. The bank reported net losses of 594.9 million dollars for the quarter and 419 million dollars for the nine months after the charge.    Last year, Bank of Nova Scotia reported a 82.3 million dollar, or 46-cent-a-share, profit for the third quarter and a 236.1 million dollar, or 1.40-dollar-a-share, profit for the nine months.    In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Royal Bank's stock closed at 34.375 dollars, up 50 cents. Bank of Montreal closed at 33 dollars, up 12.5 cents and Bank of Nova Scotia closed at 18 dollars, up 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
