The union's decision will allow rank and file members to vote on basically the same contract that NBC put forward as a &quot;final offer&quot; shortly before the strike began June 29. The decision to take a vote comes after months of negotiations -- including sessions with federal mediators -- between the broadcaster and the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians.    The only significant concession by NBC, a unit of Fairfield, Conn.-based General Electric Co., is in the length of the contract. NBC agreed to a union demand that the contract cover a three-year period rather than the two-year period originally proposed by the company.    The proposed contract would still allow NBC more flexibility in hiring temporary employees, a condition the union had fought vigorously.    The previous four-year contract expired March 31.    In putting the contract to a vote, the union apparently is bowing to pressure from union members who, according to polls, favored a vote.    Union officials couldn't be reached for comment.    Representing about a third of NBC's employees, the union's members include many who work at the company's television network, television stations and radio operations. The union last struck NBC in 1979. </TEXT></DOC>
