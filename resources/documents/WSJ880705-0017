Many traders share the view of Antonio Bustamante, Marine Midland Bank's director of foreign exchange, who rhapsodizes about &quot;a basic turnaround of the three-year bear market.&quot; These traders expect the dollar to rise this week, albeit much more slowly than it has lately.    But others contend that the dollar's recent surge is a short-term, politically motivated aberration. They expect the currency to peak around current levels within 30 days, and stay there until the U.S. elects a new president in November.    &quot;We regard the surprising rally in the dollar as short-lived,&quot; said Mark Cliffe, senior economist at a London-based research affiliate of Nomura Securities Co. of Japan. &quot;The market is testing the upper limits&quot; of central banks' tolerance.    The dollar has risen about 7% against the yen and 9% against the market in the recent rally.    The skeptics figure that in the long run, economic realities will drive the dollar lower. The U.S. still has large budget and trade deficits, and the potential for rising inflation. Some Japanese and West German analysts think the dollar's rally has been propelled by U.S. political considerations and isn't sustainable.    However, the dollar rose in Asian and European activity yesterday, following the U.S. downing of an Iranian passenger plane in the Persian Gulf that resulted in the deaths of all 298 on board. The dollar generally increases during international crises because of its reputation as a safe-haven currency.    The West German Deutsche Bundesbank reportedly sold dollars in Frankfurt around 1.8200 marks yesterday, apparently to stem the dollar's rise. The Bank of Japan continued to stay away from direct activity in the foreign exchange market, even as the dollar pushed above 135 yen.    At the end of trading in London yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8236 marks, compared with 1.8210 in New York Friday, and at 134.88 yen, compared with 134.40.    In midmorning trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 134.55 yen.    U.S. markets were closed for Independence Day.    The dollar could rise through October, says Masaharu Takenaka in Tokyo, assistant manager of the foreign exchange and fund department at the Bank of Tokyo. This &quot;will help calm inflationary pressure, and will allow the Fed to steer clear of tightening its monetary policy,&quot; said Mr. Takenaka, who looks for a dollar as high as 140 yen just before the election.    But the situation could be reversed later, because a strong dollar is likely to hamper international efforts to correct external trade imbalances.    The dollar's gain, sparked by a widespread belief that the Group of Seven industrial nations would tolerate it, has convinced many that a bottom has been set at least for the short run.    &quot;Mass psychology has turned in favor of the dollar,&quot; one currency trader says.    Koichi Miyazaki, deputy general manager of the international treasury department at Sanwa Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, expects a climb to about 145 yen in the next three months. But he discounts technical arguments for a strong dollar, saying the Republicans &quot;want Wall Street, and bond and currency markets, to prolong their stability&quot; until the election.    The West Germans think their currency won't stay down for long. Ernst Drayss, director of Deutsche Bank AG's bond research unit, said the mark in the months ahead is likely to gain against most major currencies, but most strongly against the dollar. &quot;We don't believe that a country with a low inflation rate, high current-account surpluses and a booming export economy will have to defend its currency,&quot; he said.    Manfred Kunert, chief currency dealer at DG Bank in Frankfurt, adds, &quot;The dollar is in a deadlock for a period of at least three months, protected by central banks -- which have made it clear that they won't tolerate excessive fluctations . . . The dollar remains vulnerable on the downside.&quot;    This week, the specter that central banks may sell dollars will continue to haunt the market. Many analysts believe the Bank of Japan will play a crucial role.    The Japanese central bank refrained from intervening last week even though several major West European countries sold dollars and conducted coordinated interest-rate boosts to defend their own currencies. Traders say the Bank of Japan's reticence left the window open for further dollar gains against the yen.    Comments from the Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa early last week that Japan had no intention of stemming the dollar's rise eased intervention fears further.    But a senior Bank of Japan official who wasn't identified was quoted Friday as saying that the Japanese central bank will &quot;take action&quot; this week if the yen continues to go down, saying the current mood prevailing in the currency market is &quot;undesirable,&quot; according to a report on Kyodo News Service.    David Kern, chief economist at National Westminster Bank PLC in London, thinks the dollar may ease, perhaps in reaction to &quot;recurring setbacks&quot; in the U.S. trade figures. &quot;The current market is exaggerating the dollar's strength, which I don't think is warranted by the fundamentals,&quot; he said. &quot;The markets have a well-known tendency to overshoot.&quot;    Marc Cohen, vice president at Republic National Bank in New York, predicted the dollar will move higher over the next month, then retreat as election uncertainty sets in. He sees the dollar climbing to 1.8650 marks within 30 days but falling back to 1.8150 marks by Oct. 30, and rising to 137 yen before easing to 131 yen.    One longer-term dollar bull is James Hohorst, managing director of foreign exchange at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York. He expects the dollar's rally to last more than 90 days.    &quot;The prospect for a recession sometime around the end of the year -- and the fact that this will improve our trade deficit by cutting imports and will also help the bond market to rise -- will attract a lot of capital and lead to higher interest rates,&quot; he reasons.    Mr. Hohorst figures that a recession-induced drop in U.S. demand will help the U.S. improve its trade deficit, which he predicted will be about $5 billion a month by year end. He looks for the dollar to trade at 132 yen in 30 days and 140 yen in 90 days, and at 1.8300 marks and 1.9000 marks, respectively.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for current delivery settled at $437.20 an ounce, up $1.90. Estimated volume was a moderate three million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $437.45 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Monday, July 4, 1988    Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
