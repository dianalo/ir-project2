The present version, written in Prolog(a computer language designed for logic and language parsing), producesan English narrative translation of an individual OPS5 production rule.The translation is in two steps and involves an intermediate format consistingof Prolog-readable data statements. Translation to other languages orto other forms of English would not, therefore, require changing thefirst step. Samples are shown for OPS5 production rules related to theHigh Flux Isotope Reactor Intelligent Advisor Project. The Prolog programsalso are shown. 2 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
