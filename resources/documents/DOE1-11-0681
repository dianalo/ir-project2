The clinical feature of this case was gait disturbancewith trankial ataxia. An axial CT scan showed only a diffuse high-densityarea in the cerebellar tentorium, but a coronal CT scan revealed a characteristichigh-density lesion just on the cerebellar tentorium. The hematoma wasevacuated by opening a burrhole at the convex; the gait disturbance disappearedafter this operation. The value of a coronal CT scan in this case isstressed, and the mechanism of gait disturbance in a chronic subduralhematoma is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
