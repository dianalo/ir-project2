Du Pont's invention, called Genesis 2000, isn't the first such system to appear on the market and it's too early to tell how successful it will be. But some scientists hope it will contribute improved technology for producing faster and more accurate pictures of the DNA structure. The scientists are seeking improvements in current methods of analyzing DNA, the chain of basic chemicals which direct the growth of living material, because medical research is increasingly focused on unraveling genetic abnormalities that cause disease.    &quot;It's a good first step, like the first IBM-PC computer system,&quot; says Louis Kunkel, an associate investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Boston. &quot;Studies that are getting at the genes are the cutting edge of research these days,&quot; adds Victor McKusick, a geneticist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.    Not only do scientists hope to find the clues to such diseases as diabetes, muscular dystrophy and AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) by understanding the makeup of genes, but some are now proposing to analyze in detail the human genome, the sum of the DNA chains contained within a set of chromosomes that govern the makeup and functioning of the human body.    Most DNA analysis is still done manually, but some research laboratories are now using a machine similar to Du Pont's that was introduced early this year by Applied Biosystems Inc., of Foster City, Calif. Some foreign biotechnology concerns are also developing sequencers.    The advantage of the new machines over manual methods is that they process information much more quickly and require fewer people. Sequencing is the laborious process of determining the order of the bases, the molecular subunits that line up on the double strands of DNA. A gene is comprised of a long sequence of such bases and is the blueprint that cells use to reproduce themselves and to manufacture the proteins that shape human and plant processes.    Scientists using the manual method take DNA from blood or other tissues and prepare short, radioactively labeled fragments. The fragments are separated in a gel, according to length, and the resulting pattern is seen on a film. Scientists then read the resulting X-ray-like pictures to determine the order of the bases. The process is time consuming and labor intensive because it takes several days for the film to be generated, exposed and read. Sometimes results are fuzzy and the experiments must be repeated.    The automatic sequencers prepare similar fragments but tag them with fluorescent markers. Scientists can then rapidly determine the order of the bases by identifying the markers with a laser.    The most time consuming aspect of DNA sequencing, however, is preparing clean samples, and the automatic sequencers don't yet solve this problem, scientists say. They also question the accuracy of the new systems. In addition, the machines are expensive. Genesis 2000, for example, is priced at $90,000.    Du Pont expects to begin delivery of its sequencer in February and says it has several orders. Applied Biosystems says it has sold about 100 sequencers.    &quot;It's not what the machines can do today, but their capacity for change,&quot; explains J. Craig Venter, co-director of the laboratory of molecular and cellular neurobiology at the National Institutes of Health. &quot;They make goals like sequencing the human genome really thinkable.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
