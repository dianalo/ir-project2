The provisions, approved during debate on a $283 billiondefense-authorization bill for fiscal 1991, include arequirement that Japan pay the full cost of U.S. forces inthat nation.</LP><TEXT>   The actions are the clearest signal yet that lawmakers aredetermined to make long-term, fundamental changes in how thePentagon bases and pays for U.S. forces overseas. Theshort-term effect, however, depends on whether the Senategoes along with the House approach. The White House andPentagon oppose the House language.   Meanwhile, lawmakers in the next few days are expected toreceive details about a proposal to sell to Saudi Arabia anarms package substantially larger than the Pentagon or Saudiofficials previously indicated. Some defense industryofficials estimated that the proposed sales could total asmuch as $20 billion -- about twice as large as the packagesdisclosed previously -- if the White House doesn't pare theSaudi request for political reasons.   In yesterday's action on the defense bill, the House voted370-to-53 to adopt an amendment requiring Tokyo to pay theentire $5 billion estimated annual cost of keeping 50,000U.S. troops and their dependents in Japan. If Japaneseofficials balk, the amendment requires the U.S. to reduce itsforces in that country by 5,000 soldiers each year.   Reflecting the frustration of many lawmakers, Rep. DavidBonior (D., Mich.) said: &quot;History has shown that we need tobe tough to get action from Japan.&quot;   For the first time since World War II, the House alsovoted to require the Pentagon to draft plans for so-calleddual basing of troops in Japan, West Germany and othernations. Under this concept, most of the Army and Air Forceunits stationed overseas, as well as their dependents, wouldbe brought back to U.S. bases. Small contingents of troopswould return without their dependents periodically fortraining and military exercises during six-month tours, butthe cost of keeping them overseas would be far less thanunder the current system.   The Senate version of the bill doesn't contain suchprovisions, and senior members of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee have favored a more gradual approach to burdensharing.   Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D., Colo.), the main sponsor ofthe dual-basing provision, said the U.S. currently is payingto keep more than 300,000 troops to protect West Germany fromEast German forces, while &quot;all of the East Germans areshopping in West Germany at the malls . . . . It doesn't makeany sense.&quot;   In another section of the authorization bill, the Houseagreed to set up a bipartisan commission, similar to onecreated under the Reagan administration, to recommend whichdomestic bases should be closed as overall Pentagon spendingdeclines. But the language effectively prohibits closing anybases for two years. Critics contend that would tie the handsof Pentagon officials and permit parochial interests to fightfor jobs by keeping unnecessary bases in operation.   When the House resumes debate today on the bill, one ofits most controversial provisions isn't expected to come to avote. Proponents of the B-2 Stealth bomber, which the billproposes to kill, have decided they don't want to risk alopsided defeat on the House floor. Instead, they will relyon supporters in the Senate to try to keep the radar-eludingplane alive in a conference committee.   The B-2 will survive the conference &quot;if we have a goodstrong commitment from the administration&quot; for the program,predicted Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R., Wyo.) &quot;But it's sometimeshard to know what that commitment is.&quot;   The White House has threatened to veto the defense bill ifit kills the B-2, sharply restricts funding for Star Warsantimissile research and cuts too deeply into uniformedpersonnel.   Efforts to fashion a defense bill have been complicated byuncertainties over the outcome of the current budget talksbetween Congress and the White House. In addition, lawmakershaven't decided how to factor in the expectedmultibillion-dollar cost of military operations in the MiddleEast.   House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D.,Wis.), for example, has been pushing to include the funds aspart of a later supplemental appropriations measure. OtherHouse leaders want to earmark at least $7 billion for theoperation as part of the 1991 bill.   For the Saudi arms deal, U.S. defense industry officialssaid the Bush administration is planning to request expeditedcongressional approval to sell the Saudis about 24 F-15fighters and 48 Apache tank-destructing helicopters, bothmade by McDonnell Douglas Corp. The package, according tothese officials, also is slated to include Bradley FightingVehicles, built by FMC Corp.; Patriot air-defense missilesbuilt by Raytheon Co.; as well as trucks and other supportequipment.</TEXT></DOC>
