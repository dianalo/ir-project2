After evaluating 27 potentialindicators against certain ideal attributes, the task group selected17 for the trial program. The pertinent data for these indicators werethen collected from 50 plants at 30 sites. The validation of the indicatorsconsisted of two primary processes: logical validity and statisticalanalysis. The six indicators currently in the program are scrams, safetysystem actuations, significant events, safety system failures, forcedoutage rate, and equipment forced outages per 100 critical hours. A reportcontaining data on the six performance indicators and some supplementalinformation is issued on a quarterly basis. The NRC staff is also workingon refinements of existing indicators and development of additional indicatorsas directed by the commission.</TEXT></DOC>
