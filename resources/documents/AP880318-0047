The reporters were brought in Thursday to see it was quiet inthe jungle region about 175 miles from Managua and told theoffensive had ended.   About noon, two unidentified jet planes roared in from Hondurasand dropped at least five bombs. The journalists and their hostsdived for cover, the bombs exploding as close as 70 yards away.   No one was hurt and nothing at the Sandinista militaryencampment damaged.   The region is where the White House claims Nicaraguan troopsentered Honduras in pursuit of the U.S.-supplied rebels, and theattack came just hours after the first of 3,000 American troopsbegan arriving in Honduras in response to the alleged incursion.   Honduran said it had mounted the attack, but claimed it hadtargeted only Sandinista forces in Honduran territory.   The bombs landed along the narrow Coco River, which marks theborder between the two countries. Puffs of black smoke curled overthe banana trees.   Lt. Col. Javier Carrion, the deputy chief of the Sandinistaarmy's general staff, said two bombs landed in Nicaraguan territoryand one in Honduras.   He said the attack appeared more harassment than an attempt tohit any specific target. None of the five Soviet-made helicoptersin the area were hit.   In Washington, Reagan Administration sources who insisted onanonymity claimed one Soviet-made helicopter was damaged on theground in Nicaragua. The Soviet Union suplies the Sandinistas withmilitary hardware and training.   Carrion said jets had similarly buzzed the Coco River earlier inthe day.   He denied that Sandinista troops had crossed the ill-definedborder, but said: ``There are sectors in the mountains here whereyou can get lost. It's easy to confuse the topography.''   President Daniel Ortega has refused to confirm or deny whetheran incursion had occurred. Military officials in Honduras saidtheir troops were surrounding about 2,000 Sandinista soldiers inHonduran territory on Thursday.   Standing in a jungle clearing, Carrion showed the reporters on amap where he said Sandinista troops had used artillery to destroyContra camps along a six-mile route on both sides of the Coco River.   He said the offensive, begun March 8, was halted on Wednesday onOrtega's instructions after the Sandinistas had pushed 1,800 rebelsback into Honduras. Carrion said his troops received air supportfrom Soviet-made heliopter-gunships and AN-46 propeller-drivenplanes with bombs attached.   The Sandinistas killed 92 Contras and wounded 300, but noprisoners were taken during the eight-day offensive, Carrion said.   He said it would be difficult for the Contras to return to thearea, which they had used since last year for makeshift camps.   Carrion said Sandinista troops destroyed 120 plastic and woodshacks that the rebels had been using to store supplies, forsleeping and as clinics.</TEXT></DOC>
