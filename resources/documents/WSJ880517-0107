Everett Koop, in one of the strongest indictments ever of smoking, released a report yesterday that condemned tobacco as &quot;addicting in the same sense as are drugs such as heroin and cocaine.&quot;    Health groups immediately called for a wide range of new regulations on tobacco, while the Tobacco Institute, an industry trade group, said the report &quot;contradict(s) common sense&quot; and trivializes society's problems with illegal drugs.    Dr. Koop said he hoped that the 618-page report mandated by Congress, representing the work of more than 50 scientists, would spur lawmakers to force the tobacco industry to include a warning about nicotine addiction on tobacco products. If it were up to him, Dr. Koop said, such a warning would say tobacco &quot;is just as addictive as heroin or cocaine.&quot;    At a news conference in Washington, D.C., following Dr. Koop's presentation of the report, Rep. Bob Whittaker (R., Kan.) said he has already introduced legislation that would require an addiction warning label and would bring cigarettes under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration.    The surgeon general also called for insurance companies to offer reimbursement to individuals for smoking cessation programs, just as they do currently for programs designed to combat alcohol and illegal drug dependence.    Dr. Koop also urged a ban on vending machine sales of cigarettes to keep tobacco away from children, noting that smoking addiction usually begins during childhood or adolescence. He suggested that the sale of tobacco to children and teenagers should be treated just as seriously as the sale of alcohol. Because studies show that young people are less likely to buy cigarettes when they are more expensive, Dr. Koop also suggested raising the federal excise tax.    Dr. Koop avoided direct comment on the new smokeless cigarette to be unveiled later this year by RJR Nabisco Inc.'s tobacco unit, but said in response to questions that &quot;any new nicotine delivery system&quot; should be evaluated for &quot;toxic and addictive effects.&quot;    Health groups praised the report and quickly seized upon it to promote a broad menu of new regulation. The American Medical Association said it &quot;fully concurs&quot; with the surgeon general's conclusions about nicotine addiction and supports his idea for a new label that warns of addiction. The AMA also called for a minimum cigarette purchase age of 21 and the banning of all advertising and promotion of tobacco products.    Tobacco stocks moved very little on the announcement. Analysts explained that the financial community had been aware of the direction that would be taken by the report. Lawrence Adelman, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the long-range impact of the report was difficult to assess. He said the report &quot;doesn't surprise anybody.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
