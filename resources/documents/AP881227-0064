Thousands of Chinese youths chanting ``Kill the black ghosts!''on Monday surrounded the central Chinese city's train station as thestudents tried to depart for the capital by train, Americanwitnesses said.   But police would not let the Africans embark, one Americanstudent said.   Chinese students at a university in Nanking did not attendclasses today and officials at another school urged students not toparticipate in further demonstrations, American students said.   Several truckloads of police patrolled the city, the Americanssaid.   The clashes and demonstrations, which began Saturday and lasteduntil Monday night, are the latest in a series of incidents betweenChinese and China's 1,500 African students. Two years ago, thegovernment crushed widespread student demonstrations seeking greaterdemocracy.   China prides itself on its good ties with African countries.Relations between the Africans and Chinese, however, have often beenstrained. Chinese often are openly racist, saying they find blackpeople dirty.   The problem is compounded because African students in China aremostly single men, who spend up to six years here and want to dateChinese women.   ``Chinese teachers and students think this is improper,especially with African men,'' said a U.S. diplomat.   The six Americans held at the hotel, all of whom are white, wentto the train station with the Africans to express solidarity withthem. The U.S. diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saidthe protests did not have an anti-American character.   He said after talking to the students that they were beingtreated well but wanted to return to their universities. ``Theaverage student feels he is being held against his will,'' he said.   The American students included five women and one man, and arefrom U.S. universities such as Duke University in North Carolina andWesleyan University in Connecticut. Their names were not released.   Huang Jie, an official at the Jiangsu province foreign affairsoffice, said most of the students had returned to their schools. Butthe U.S. diplomat and officials at several schools in Nanking saidthis was not true.   The U.S. official also said that ambassadors from three Africancountries met with the African students today to talk about theirsafety concerns.   The incident in Nanking began when African students at HehaiUniversity wanted to bring two Chinese women to a party but refuseda guard's request for the women's identification.   In a brawl that followed, 11 Chinese and two Africans wereinjured, the official Xinhua news agency reported.   Later Sunday, Hehai's 70 African students fled the school for theNanking train station where they were joined by Africans from otherschools, along with the six Americans.   On Sunday night, Chinese police stopped them from taking a trainto Beijing.   Monday afternoon, a crowd of about 5,000 Chinese marched to thetrain station and 2,000 succeeded in getting around a policebarricade, American witnesses said.   The Africans only left the train station after Chinese officialstold them they would let the Chinese students inside if they didn'tleave.   Joe Profaizer, an English teacher at Nanking University, said theChinese students who participated in the march Monday said they weredoing so because they ``didn't believe the government was interestedin upholding the law.''   However, other Americans said they believed the fundamentalnature of the protests remained anti-black.   Profaizer said Chinese students at Nanking University told himthey had been told not to demonstrate. Chinese students also toldhim that students at Hehai University had not attended classestoday, he said.   Africans and Chinese have had a series of clashes over the lastfew years.   In 1986 a fight broke out between African and Chinese students inthe northeastern port city of Tianjin, and 18 Africans fled tosafety in Beijing. About 200 African students in the capital stageda march through Beijing streets complaining of racial discriminationagainst blacks.   In 1980, 19 Africans and Arabs and 24 Chinese were injured in afight in Shanghai that began over loud music from a foreigner'sradio.</TEXT></DOC>
