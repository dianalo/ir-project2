The exercise, important to demonstrate that thousands ofU.S. troops can work together in the harsh desertenvironment, got the go-ahead after Saudi leaders reversedtheir initial opposition to such large-scale troop movements,according to U.S. military officials. The cautious andtradition-bound Saudis have been reluctant to allowlarge-scale maneuvers by U.S. troops until now.</LP><TEXT>   Approval for the exercise came this past week as theSaudis also made more airfield and training areas availableto U.S. forces, especially those protecting vital oil,shipping and other industrial facilities in the northeastregion.   &quot;There is still some reluctance by the Saudis about wherewe can go and where we can train,&quot; said Maj. Baxter Ennis,the spokesman for the Army's 82nd Airborne Division from FortBragg, N.C. But, he said, the situation has &quot;improveddramatically&quot; in recent days.   When Defense Secretary Dick Cheney visited troops lastweekend, Col. Gene Cole, the division's aviation commander,praised the Saudi government's cooperation. &quot;We've hadexcellent support&quot; from the Saudi military, Col. Cole toldthe secretary, adding that his troops were &quot;totally confidentthat we can do the mission.&quot;   But a visit with an Army platoon handling anti-tank towweapons in the 115 degree desert heat, shows that some dayand night exercises still are being blocked by Saudiopposition. &quot;As they start giving us more freedom tooperate,&quot; said one soldier, &quot;our troops will get betteracclimated to living in the desert.&quot;   This past week, cargo planes received permission to useadditional landing strips throughout the country to speed upthe flow of men and war materials, according to U.S. militaryofficials.   A group of reporters watched a giant long-range C-5 cargoaircraft land at one of those isolated strips, which also haddozens of the Army's anti-tank helicopters and combatvehicles lined up on the tarmac guarded by U.S. troops.   While the sprawling airfield has a six-story control towerand huge storage buildings, it isn't near any major highwayand is difficult to spot among the rolling sand dunes.   Military officials here declined to provide details, andreporters are restricted from disclosing the specifics ofsuch bases and exercises.   In many units, only about half of the soldiers have hadthe opportunity to actually train in the Saudi desert,according to officers and enlisted men. The troops areconserving ammunition and missiles by not doing any actualfiring during exercises. Even the vehicles that the 82ndAirborne brought into the area seem strangely out of place:Their khaki-green color must be changed by slapping on mud orsome other type of camouflage to make them blend into thedesert.   &quot;We're oriented toward the jungle and city warfare, notthe desert,&quot; one soldier told reporters with a shrug.   But by other measures, the U.S. deployment is proceedingfairly smoothly. The American military presence has grown solarge that convoys of Army vehicles mingle freely with thecars being driven on the coastal road that links some of thecountry's major oil and chemical facilities.   Marines and some of the Army's most potent tanks areexpected to replace paratroopers in some forward positions.One 19-year-old private from Tulsa, Okla., summed it up thisway: &quot;The Saudis built all the airfields, underground bunkersand bases necessary to protect their country. Now, we'reputting in U.S. troops to get the most out of thatinvestment.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
