Jumbo jets line up to take off and land at asingle runway. About 55,000 passengers a day -- 50% more thanintended -- jostle through its terminal. Jet-lagged arrivalsendure long train or bus rides to downtown Tokyo. Barbedwire, moats and concrete stockades ring the site, guarded by1,500 riot police in outfits that look like space-age samuraiarmor.   And desperately needed growth comes to a screeching haltat the hedgerow bordering Kakichi Ogawa's sweet-potato andcarrot patches.</LP><TEXT>   How can this surreal and chaotic scene exist in a countryrenowned for its social harmony and uncanny efficiency?   The 25-year saga of New Tokyo International Airport --everyone calls it Narita, where it's located -- speaksvolumes about how Japan works, and sometimes doesn't. It's atale whose main characters include conservative farmers,left-wing radicals, elite bureaucrats and a self-styled&quot;business anthropology&quot; professor. It has already claimed adozen lives and billions of dollars in wasted time andopportunities.   And the end is still not in sight. Authorities hope tocomplete the airport's second phase by late next year -- 18years behind schedule. But to do so, in the next few monthsthey'll have to acquire the 52 acres of airport-area landstill in private hands. That's only 2% of the land, but it'sdirectly in the path of progress.   Finally getting that land will mean winning over the likesof Mr. Ogawa, who owns one of eight remaining farmsteads thathas withstood 20 years of government carrot-and-stickrelocation efforts. After years of delays andsometimes-violent opposition, Japan's vaunted bureaucratsaren't making any predictions.   The government could seize the land through a specialprefectural committee. But the panel's then-chairman wascrippled in 1988 when left-wing radicals beat him with steelpipes. The rest of the committee got the message anddisbanded.   The authorities &quot;had declared they were going to go aheadwith forced expropriation,&quot; explains Koichi Kishi, a43-year-old former student activist who heads the Naritabranch of Chukakuha, the leftist revolutionary sect thatclaimed responsibility for the beating. &quot;To us, expropriationis violence. So to fight it, it's natural to use violence.&quot;   Mr. Kishi, his hair now flecked with gray, adds: &quot;It wasthe only way we could win.&quot;   From a fairly straightforward confrontation between smallfarmers and uppity bureaucrats in the mid-1960s, Narita hasevolved into a Kabuki play of dueling egos and shiftingalliances, not unlike the internal rivalries that shapeJapanese politics at every level. The eight farm households,for example, have managed to split into three factions.   Mr. Ogawa heads one of them. &quot;The government decided {theairport plan} by itself, then told us to go along for thegood of the country -- just like war in the old days,&quot; huffsthe grandfatherly 67-year-old. &quot;It's undemocratic.&quot;   Of the 325 homes that once dotted the site, 317 haveaccepted government offers of money and alternate land. Mr.Ogawa owns about eight acres of land on the airport site.Based on the rates the airport authority says it will pay forvarious categories of land, Mr. Ogawa's spread would probablyfetch slightly less than $1 million, with an option on landelsewhere. Why not take the money and run? &quot;It doesn't matterhow much they'd offer,&quot; Mr. Ogawa says. &quot;It's not a questionof money.&quot;   His attitude stems partly from Japan's extraordinarilystrong occupancy rights and partly from this area's peculiarhistory. Two years before he was born, Mr. Ogawa's familybegan working this land, once part of a vast imperiallivestock farm. Eventually, the family was able to buy theland it had tilled.   After World War II, returnees from Japan's colonies carvedmore fields from the imperial estate -- back-breaking work ata time when farm machinery was almost nonexistent. &quot;It was aterrible time,&quot; recalls Koji Kitahara, a merchant and Naritalandowner who heads the second faction. &quot;The country wasshort of food, so they parceled out undeveloped land. It tookfive or 10 years to cultivate good crops. Then the airportcame along.&quot;   A government decision in 1965 to put the airport on alarger site nearby was dropped when farmers there balked.Officials crafted a new plan around the imperial estate,figuring that with more than half the land already in publichands, they could easily acquire the rest.   They were wrong. By 1968, even octogenarian villagers werepelting riot police with pouches of excrement. With its echoof historic peasant rebellions, the struggle became a leftistcause celebre. Students saw the seeds of revolution. In themost violent clash, sparked by government expropriation ofland in 1971, 5,000 protesters battled 5,300 police duringfive days, leaving three police dead, 206 people injured and475 protesters arrested.   Film makers and scholars took up residence. A large photoon Mr. Ogawa's wall captures his visit to China at MaoTsetung's invitation.   Authorities finally declared the airport's first phaseready to open in March 1978. But days before the debut,extremists broke into the control tower and bashed equipment,causing another two-month postponement. And that still leftthe second and last phase, which is supposed to include twomore runways -- Mr. Ogawa's fields sprawl across what wouldbe one of them -- and a second terminal building.   In recent years, the anti-airport alliance began to showcracks. Mr. Ogawa, arguing that the movement should get backto its farming roots, split with Mr. Kitahara's group in 1987and renounced ties with the radical sects. But governmentefforts to cozy up to him fell flat: When the then-Ministerof Transport called at Mr. Ogawa's home a year ago, Mr. Ogawarefused to come to the door.   Authorities' hopes for a mediated settlement now ride on anew &quot;regional promotion council&quot; started by members of thethird faction and local politicians. The group's chairman, aU.S.-educated university professor, has lived for the pastdecade in one of the small villages around the airport,building the kind of personal ties needed for such a delicatetask.   Chairman Motofusa Murayama, a self-styled &quot;businessanthropology&quot; specialist, conducts a kind of shuttlediplomacy, meeting one day with Tokyo bureaucrats in adiscreet downtown cafe, journeying several hundred miles onanother to pay respects to the parents of an activist killed14 years ago in an airport clash. Bodyguards, hired after hereceived threats, follow his every move.   &quot;Narita can't be solved in terms of economics, technologyor law,&quot; Mr. Murayama says. &quot;It's a matter of community, ofculture.&quot; In December, the council sponsored a&quot;repose-of-the-souls ceremony&quot; for victims of the struggle.   The other factions are suspicious. &quot;It's a sham,&quot; contendsMr. Ogawa. &quot;They're helping the land thieves.&quot; Mr. Murayamais philosophical. Factionalization is inherent in villageculture, he muses. &quot;People talk about Japanese consensus andgroupism, right? It's not real.&quot;   To the farmer and third-faction spokesman who dreamed upthe council, the airport fight &quot;is really fun now.&quot; ShinjiIshii grins as he chugs beer and digs into a platter ofpeppery preserved fish. A husky 43-year-old with a crew cutand a stubble of beard, Mr. Ishii boasts of being arrested 13times since the airport fray began. &quot;In the beginning, nobodylistened to us,&quot; he says. &quot;Now, it's different.&quot;   As he sees it, the best solution would be to convert aU.S. air base somewhere to civilian use. But to theChukakuha's Mr. Kishi, Mr. Ishii's recent huddle with thesecretary-general of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Partyamounts to fraternization with the enemy.   Japan's authorities are trying to pry the radicals out ofthe picture. In recent months, they've razed or wrapped inbarbed-wire coils several &quot;solidarity huts&quot; and makeshiftforts erected by leftists on private airport plots. They'vealso launched a public-relations campaign, includingnewspaper ads and subway posters, stressing Narita'scongestion and efforts to settle with the farmers.   Meanwhile, the authorities are hoping Mr. Murayama'sshuttle diplomacy will eventually win over Mr. Ogawa and thatMr. Kitahara will follow. Otherwise, concedes TransportMinistry official Hidenobu Ochi, &quot;we've run out of moves&quot; fornow.   There is one bit of good news for Tokyo frequent fliers:Last month, trains started running directly into Narita'sexisting terminal, cutting a few minutes from the tripdowntown. But the trip still takes an hour. A much-fasterbullet train was originally planned, but railroad authoritiescouldn't acquire enough land to run it.</TEXT></DOC>
