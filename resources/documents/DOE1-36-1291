<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-36-1291 </DOCNO><TEXT>A series of pipe rupture tests has been performed at the Japan AtomicEnergy Research Institute (JAERI) to demonstrate the safety of the primarycoolant circuits in the event of pipe rupture, in nuclear power plants.The present report summarizes the results of cross-over leg pipe whiptests (RUNs 5808, 5809), under PWR LOCA conditions (325 deg C, 15.7 MPa),which were performed in April, 1984. The cross-over leg pipe whip testwas performed to demonstrate the integrity of the restraints at the LOCAby using a 1/6 model of piping in the PWR nuclear power plants. Strain-gages,accelerometers and load cells were used to measure the dynamic responseof the test pipe. Test results showed that the deformation of the restraintswere within elastic region, and the residual deformation at the freeend of pipe was within 10 mm.</TEXT></DOC>
