Atlee Burpee Co. unit, a Warminster, Pa.-based supplier of home garden products, to a new company that includes Burpee's current management. The price wasn't disclosed.    In addition to the Burpee group, the new company comprises Wicks Capital Corp., an investment company, and BT Capital Corp., a New York-based affiliate of Bankers Trust Co.    Clayton andamp; Dubilier, a New York investment concern specializing in leveraged buyouts, acquired Burpee in December as part of its purchase of the lawn and garden group of ITT Corp., a New York-based telecommunications and consumer products company. As part of that transaction, which totaled about $150 million, Clayton andamp; Dubilier also acquired O.M. Scott andamp; Sons Co., a Marysville, Ohio, lawn-care products concern.    In a leveraged buyout, an investor group acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
