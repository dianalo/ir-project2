The efficiencyof crosslink formation is 100 times greater in irradiated isolated chromatinthan in chromatin irradiated in cells before isolation. Gamma-irradiationof isolated chromatin in the presence of radical scavengers shows thatOH . is the most effective radical for the promotion of crosslinkingwhereas e/sub aq//sup -/ and O/sub 2//sup -/ are essentially ineffective.For chromatin irradiated in the cell before isolation, fewer crosslinksare formed in air than in an atmosphere of nitrogen; the greatest effectis found in cells irradiated in an atmosphere of nitrous oxide, suggestingthat OH . may be involved in the formation of crosslinks in vivo. Onthe basis of comparing radiation-induced crosslinking in whole chromating(DNA, H1 histone, the core histones - H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 - and non-histonechromosomal proteins) and in a chromatin subunit (DNA and the core histones),the authors identified the core histones as the specific chromosomalproteins predominantly involved in crosslinking to DNA.</TEXT></DOC>
