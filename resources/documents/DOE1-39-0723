<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-39-0723 </DOCNO><TEXT>Oxide superconductors are described in terms of macroscopic wave functionsPSI and PHI corresponding, respectively, to electron pairs of the superconductingand insulating states. In terms of the total free energy of the system,including the effect of interaction, we discuss the electrodynamic responsesof the oxide superconductors in relation with the experiments to data.(author). 10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
