<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-68-0492 </DOCNO><TEXT>Practical hints for the application of the indirect Fourier transformationmethods are given. In detail there are discussed the problems of stabilizationof the least squares routine, the estimation of the maximum dimensionof the particles, the choice of an appropriate number of the spline functions,the combination of scattering functions measured with different primarybeam geometry, standard deviation and error propagation of the solutionfunctions, influence of the interparticle interference effect and backgroundscattering on the results, determination of the radius of gyration andthe scattering intensity at zero angle and finally the possibility ofsimulation of measuring curves starting with model bodies is described.It is attempted to demonstrate the advantages of indirect Fourier transformationon hand of several practical examples.
