 And if you plan to dismantle the temporary site in afew months, all the headaches and costs of wiring it up won't be worth thepotential benefits.andM;Or maybe some of your tech staff moves around the company to hard-to-accesslocations.andP;  They have to stay on the network wherever they go--but how do youkeep them connected?andM;The answer to these problems is wireless networking, either to replace or toaugment wire-based LANs.andM;Wireless LAN systems use one of three transmission techniques: UHF radio,some type of light beam, or carrier current radio, which sends signalsthrough AC power lines.andP;  Of the five wireless LAN packages we review in thisroundup, two rely on UHF radio to send their data, one makes use of infraredlight beams to do the job, and two employ a novel method of sending datathrough your building's AC power lines to your networked PCs.andM;UHF radio systems, such as LAWN and ARLAN 450 (both reviewed here), operatenear the same frequencies as cellular telephones--slightly over 900 MHz.andO;They usually cover a frequency spread of 20 or more megahertz, whichqualifies them as spread-spectrum systems.andP;  Spreading the signals over a widebandwidth reduces their susceptibility to many noise sources that are foundin commercial buildings.andP;  And equally important, spread-spectrum technologyimproves security--even beyond that of conventional wired LANs--since nosingle frequency can be tapped to siphon off data.andM;Light-wave systems, like the Photolink package we tested, typically operatein the infrared spectrum; the beams of light they produce are invisible tothe human eye.andP;  Interestingly, the system don't have to be within view ofeach other to communicate.andP;  They can work by reflecting light beams off somecommon point like a distant ceiling or wall.andP;  The wide bandwidths oflight-wave systems and some radio systems allow signaling at a rate ofseveral hundred kilobits per second (kbps).andM;Carrier current radio systems such as POWERNet and CarrierNET fall into adifferent category.andP;  They send low-frequency radio signals over AC powerlines, so they aren't &quot;wireless&quot; in the strictest sense.andP;  At about $200 pernode, they are less expensive than UHF and light-wave transceivers, but theirnarrow bandwidth and RS-232 cabling limit their signaling rate to a maximumof 115.2 kbps.andM;DIFFICULTES A PARADISandM;Beware: for all the physical flexibility they offer, wireless LANs sufferfrom a number of drawbacks inherent to sending network data over anythingother than dedicated lines.andP;  For example, systems such as CarrierNET that useserial ports usually limit throughput to 9,600 bits per second or less.andO;Faster transmission is too much for serial ports to handle, so you'll have touse some type of internal adapter to route the input/output data streambetween the PC and the transceiver (transmitter/receiver).andM;Radio and infrared technologies are both limited by range and environment.andO;Radio-based systems' signals can travel about a quarter of a mile outdoorsand 200 or 300 feet indoors.andP;  With infrared light beams, the range is limitedto the line of sight between one station and another station or a reflector.andO;And, outdoor transmission for either technology can be adversely affected byweather conditions.andM;Although radio systems like LAWN and ARLAN 450 use the spread spectrum tominimize interference, other radio sources can disrupt their communications.andO;In one particularly mysterious case, our PC LAN Labs crew was stumped byLAWN's miserable performance.andP;  We spent several days looking at such factorsas different versions of the ROM BIOS, bad transceivers, and even thepresence of nearby military radar installations.andP;  As it turned out, theproblem wasn't the LAWN system; the motion sensors in PC LAN Labs' burglaralarm (which emit and sense reflected radio waves) blanketed out the LAWNsignals.andM;To test the theory, we jimmied the alarm panel and disconnected the motiondetector on a Saturday night.andP;  This sent a silent alarm to the securitycompany and resulted in a visit to the LAN Labs from several representativesof the local sheriff's office.andP;  LAWN worked, but we had some explaining todo.andM;UHF and infrared technologies have another drawback in common: relativelyhigh cost.andP;  These are complex technologies, and parts for each UHF radio- orlight-wave transceiver are pricey.andP;  LAWN, a UHF wireless network, costs $499per transceiver, and that's the least expensive product of its type in ourreview group.andP;  You can typically install Novell's Advanced NetWare 286 withARCnet or Ethernet adapters for about the same money and get more capabilityand throughput--but only if you'll run the cables.andM;For those thinking of avoiding broadcast technologies altogether, don'tassume that choosing an AC power-line product will eliminate all obstacles.andO;Because low-frequency signals will not go through transformers, all of theLAN stations must be on the same leg of the AC transformer that feeds powerto the building.andP;  If the transceivers are fed from different transformerwindings, some transceivers may be able to interact with transceivers in onepart of the building but not in another.andP;  There are work-arounds for theseproblems, but you will need well-trained electricians and special equipment.andM;AC power-line products may become known for uncovering unsolvable mysteries.andO;During our tests we found some AC power connectors that were inexplicablydead to carrier current radio signals; evidently they are good for nothingmore than sending print jobs.andP;  Yet another caveat: specialized softwaredrivers and other proprietary components are often necessary when you areinterfacing conventional LANs with wireless products.andP;  If you intend to setup a mixed LAN, make sure you can get a guarantee from the wireless LANvendor that the arrangement you have in mind will actually work.andM;If you still believe that wireless LAN technology is a viable alternative foryour company, keep in mind that there is one more wireless option on themarket.andP;  At least one company--Agilis, of Mountain View, California--has apatented version of spread-spectrum radio technology that is said to permit arate of 230 kbps.andP;  We were unable to test the Agilis product because it iscurrently available only as part of a line of modular hand-held PCworkstations.andP;  Agilis promises an ISA bus transceiver and adapter for laterthis year.andP;  The product's current speed is sufficient for e-mail but fallsfar short of Ethernet's theoretical limit of 10 megabits per second.andP;  Theupshot?andP;  For heavy-duty LAN operations, you still need wires.andM;Switching your system to a wireless LAN may simply mean you've exchangedcable problems for other headaches.andP;  Some UHF and light-wave systems are ableto carry the load of real workgroups.andP;  Others are limited to low-speedsignaling rates and can't provide the file-sharing capabilities ofmedia-shared networks.andM;Nevertheless, two products, Photolink and ARLAN 450, allow full LANcapabilities.andP;  They let you take a shared resource such as a server's harddisk and treat it as a &quot;virtual drive,&quot; making it appear as a DOS driveletter on your desktop PC.andP;  O'Neill Communications' LAWN, Photonics Corp.'sPhotolink, and Telesystems SLW's ARLAN 450 have unique features that willappeal to different buyers.andP;  If you can't install cables to make your networkgo, one of these products will probably solve your no-cable dilemma.andM;RADIO LANS: Threat or Menace?andM;As the guy who usually beats the drum loudest for new technology, I feelstrange sounding a cautionary note here.andP;  A radio-frequency (RF) LAN solves avariety of problems, mostly having to do with installation and ease of use.andO;It uses very high technology, including spread-spectrum transmission, atechnique favored by the military for its security and freedom frominterference.andM;My biggest objection is that it's a radio device.andP;  Computer manufacturers arespending millions under intense scrutiny from the FCC lest their machinesemit a stray microwatt of RF energy.andP;  Yet the RF LAN vendors propose that weplunk an antenna on top of the machine and pump out tens of thousands oftimes more power into an environment already reeling with unnecessaryelectronic emissions.andP;  The FCC doesn't mind because radio devices aresupposed to emit, while PCs aren't.andM;With mounting concern about emissions in almost every part of the radiospectrum, who's to say what is safe?andP;  Workers, manufacturers, and researchersare still debating safe levels for electromagnetic fields emanating frommonitors and these levels are far lower than those associated with with radioLANs (see &quot;Unwanted Emissions: EMI and RMI,&quot; PC Magazine October 31, 1989,page 140).andP;  Indeed, the only reasons that I haven't invested in a portablecellular phone are the doubts I feel about having the antenna a few inchesfrom my head.andM;Security and freedom from interference are shaky propositions at best.andP;  Yourcompetitor can simply move in next door, buy the same brand of RF LAN youown, and tune in on your business.andP;  For that matter, your enterprising,technologically oriented employees can conceivably browse the activities ofother servers and other departments in their spare time.andP;  And who's to knowwhat will cause interference?andP;  The original Sputnik set off garage dooropeners as it swept overhead.andP;  NORAD's radar once interpreted the rising moonas an enemy missile launch.andP;  The speakerphone on my desk receivesconversations from gypsy cabs out on Park Avenue.andM;It irks me that manufacturers are overlooking a viable solution: infrared.andO;Of the five wireless systems in this roundup, only Photolink takes advantageof this technology.andP;  Light-emitting diodes and sensors are cheap and capableof high daa rates; everyone agrees they have no deleterious effects on theenvironment or its inhabitants.andP;  The only problem is that light doesn't goaround corners or through walls.andP;  Never mind--engineers thrive on adversity.andO;It's easy to imagine a variety of repeaters, light pipes, corner reflectors,and other devices on door frames and atop cubicle walls.andM;Let's hope that the RF LAN branch of technology withers before it takesvaluable light from less questionable endeavors.andM;EDITOR'S CHOICEandM;ARLAN 450andM;LAWNandM;A general endorsement goes to the wireless LAN products that usespread-spectrum radio techniques to transfer data, perform e-mail tasks, andshare printers.andP;  These systems are more practical and offe better flexibilitythan AC power-line alternatives and also beat out the optical options in mostinstallations.andM;Telesystems SLW offers ARLAN 450, whose use of Novell's NetWare along withspread-spectrum technology makes it hard to beat.andP;  Setting up ARLAN is muchlike installing normal network cards except that the adapters connect to anantenna instead of to cabling.andP;  ARLAN provides excellent capability for manyLAN designers--at a steep price.andM;O'Neill Communications' LAWN also employs spread-spectrum technology, but thetransmitters have lower power and the software doesn't possess thecapabilities of a full LAN operating system.andP;  Among its strong points, itrequires virtually no technical expertise to install or operate.andM;In select installations, the RS-232C and multiport capabilities of PhotonicsCorp.'s Photolink make it the best choice, but the need for a direct line ofsigh (or at least a surface to bounce the light off) limits the number ofplaces you can use this product.andP;  When if fits, it works beautifully, but itdoesn't fit in enough places to earn Editor's Choice status, and it lacksNetWare capability.andM;The choice between ARLAN 450 and LAWN is a choice between high cost with manyfeatures and relative economy with less versatility.andP;  Either one can be alifesaver when cables just won't do.andM;WIRELESS LANs: SUITABILITY TO TASKandM;Which wireless LAN scheme is best for you?andP;  It's not enough for a no-cableLAN to solve your logistical problem; if it won't perform the LAN tasksnecessary to your workplace, the fact that its signal reaches to Timbuktuwon't help much.andM;We rated these five systems on their ability to handle four specific LANtasks: file transfer, printer sharing, electronic mial, and database access.andO;Effective throughput accounts for alarge part of this rating, but the abilityto work in a background mode can compensate for low speeds.andP;  If you candispatch an electronic mail message or print job and then turn to other work,it generally doesn't matter whether the actual transfer takes 4 seconds or aminute and 4 seconds.andM;Each task has different characteristics.andP;  An exchange of e-mail messages isessentially a server-to-server file tranfer with overhead.andP;  Sending a printjob to a printer involves spocling and queuing the job in addition to movinga file.andP;  With a traditional program, a single manipulation of a databaserequires sending hundreds of blocks of data across the link.andM;Factors other than speed can add a lot to a system's appeal.andP;  The ability toshare a printer without having an attached PC is valuable, no matter how longthe file transmission takes.andP;  And not every product will accomplish its tasksright out of the box.andP;  Each product was reviewed in its test configuration,which means that PC LAN Labs may have added an operating system an interfacecard, and appropriate e-mail software, as any user would have to do.andO;Consider the total cost of a wireless LAN package before you make acommitment.andM;0 = Completely unsuited for the task 1 = Poorly suited for the task 2 =Marginal for the task 3 = Good for the task 4 = Excellent for the taskandM;SUMMARY OF FEATURES: WIRELESS LANsandM;Each of these wireless LANs uses a menu-driven network operating system,either in the form of bundled proprietary software or a third-party systemlike TOPS or NetWare.andP;  In each case, the system permits file transfer,e-mail, and printer-sharing functions.andM;PERFORMANCEandM;TESTS:andM;WIRELESS LANsandM;Our Wireless LAN File Transfer Test involved sending a 50K file from onemachine to another using DOS commands or similar commands from the networksoftware.andP;  In each case, we ran the test repeatedly and reported an averageresult.andM;Each test was based on conditions appropriate for the individual system.andO;While the setups are not precisely equivalent, they do represent typicalinstallations and an attempt to put each system in its best light.andM;To test CarrierNET and POWERNet, we moved a 50K data file from the RAMdisk ofone 12-MHz Dell System 200 to the RAMdisk of another.andP;  The transfer timesvaried widely, so we performed many test turns and found the median score foreach product.andM;We used the same setup for LAWN, but the time became consistent only after wedisconnected a local source of radio interference.andP;  All three of theseproducts attach to the PC's serial port, but LAWN's maximum RS-32C signalingrate of 9.6 kilobits per second limits its performance.andM;We installed one ARLAN 450 adapter in a Dell System 325 file server runningAdvanced NetWare 286, Version 2.15.andP;  The client station was a Dell System200.andM;We tested Photolink using the TOPS Network Software, FlashCard adapters, andFarallon connectors for LocalTalk.andP;  A Dell System 325 acted as the fileserver and a Dell System 200 was the client.andP;  This arrangement gave Photolinka direct connection into the PC's data bus and materially increased the costof the installation.andP;  The upcoming version of Photolink, which connectsthrough the serial port, will be limited by the maximum throughput of theserial connection.andM;The RS-232C connections between the slower units and their PCs limit theirthroughput more than the interest limitations of the airwave or power line.andO;The faster performers have internal adapter-board connections between clientPCs and the signaling devices.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
