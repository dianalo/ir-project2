Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency, meanwhile, said there was``nothing unusual'' going on in Albania, one day after reportingthat authorities there had imposed a virtual state of emergency toprevent unrest.   Also Saturday, the Albanian state-run news agency ATA quoted anItalian diplomat as denying there was unrest in the isolatedcountry.   Albania, located between Greece and Yugoslavia, is the lastbastion of Stalinism in Eastern Europe and is closed to mostforeigners, so none of the reports could be independently confirmed.   Daily newspapers in Greece on Saturday quoted Albert Tzeka, 20,as saying widespread protests had broken out in at least threecities in his country against the hard-line Communist leadership.   ``The people have risen up. The people and the students ...especially in Shkoder, Korce and Sarande,'' Tzeka was quoted assaying.   ``In Shkoder there is a revolution. The army and the sigurimi(security police) fired on the people and there are many dead andinjured,'' the daily Kathimerini quoted Tzeka as saying.   Yugoslav and Greek newspapers have carried unconfirmed reportssince Thursday of demonstrations and a state of emergency inShkoder, Albania's second-largest city.   Tzeka said that in Shkoder, ``the police, wanting to subdue thedemonstrators, fired upon them. They hanged four students to set anexample.'' He added that the demonstrators seemed determined tocontinue their uprising.   The Athens newspapers did not say how Tzeka, who was serving onthe southern Albanian border, obtained his information,particularly about Shkoder, which is in the north.   The newspaper Eleftherotypia quoted Tzeka as saying that ``welearn everything in my country by word of mouth.''   Tzeka said also that border patrols along the Greek and Yugoslavborders were intensified after the December uprising in Romania,which ousted the Stalinist leadership of Nicolae Ceausescu.   He was quoted as saying Albanian soldiers had been ordered tokill anyone trying to escape.   An officer at the Greek border village of Filiates confirmedTzeka crossed the Albanian border Tuesday and requested politicalasylum.   Albanian authorities have consistently denied any trouble intheir country, describing reports of turmoil as ``slander.''   Tzeka could not be reached by The Associated Press on Saturday.   In Yugoslavia, the Tanjug news agency said information availablefrom police and travelers at the Yugoslav-Albanian border Saturdaysuggested there was ``nothing unusual, nothing special'' in Albania.   It said even shopping trips by diplomats in Albania, who usuallyvisit the Yugoslav towns of Struga and Ohrid over the weekend, havenot been halted.   On Friday, Tanjug reported that ``Albanian authorities, in aneffort to prevent unrest against the regime, have imposed extremelystrict control measures in the country.''   It said the security measures ``can be termed a state ofemergency,'' but did not say when the measures were allegedlyimposed.   Albania's ATA news agency Saturday quoted Paolo de Nicola, theinterim charge d'affaires of the Italian Embassy in Tirana, assaying at the Foreign Ministry that Italian media reports aboutunrest in Albania ``do not refer to reality, they are groundless.''   Miloslav Milic, a reporter for Belgrade television fromYugoslavia's Kosovo province which borders Alabania, told TheAssociated Press that ``frequent sound of firearms'' was heardFriday from the direction of Albania.</TEXT></DOC>
