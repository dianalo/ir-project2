(TheCorporate Micro) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Seymour, Jim.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Many customers and stockholders in Novell Inc were happy that theproposed merger-acquisition of Novell by Lotus Development Corpcollapsed.andP;  For one thing, there was a feeling that the deal madeno sense in terms of the compatibility of the respective productlines of the two companies.andP;  There was also concern that the pricebeing paid for Novell, which has been a highly profitable stockfor its shareholders, was far too low.andP;  Customers were concernedthat Novell, upon losing managerial control due to a proposedfour-to-three ratio on the board of directors of the unitedcompany, might lose control of its product development direction.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Novell Inc.
