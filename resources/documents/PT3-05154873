In the re-slicing process, a thin slice base is mounted on the periphery      of a semiconductor wafer prior to the re-slicing process for protecting      the periphery of the wafer from chipping off damage during the re-slicing      process by an ID saw or the like. The present invention provides several      examples of methods and apparatus for mounting a slice base prepared in      advance on the periphery of a semiconductor wafer by utilizing the method      and apparatus of the present invention. In addition, another method and      apparatus for simultaneously molding and mounting a molded type slice base      by using a thermosetting type resin on the periphery of the semiconductor,      whereby the re-slicing process of a semiconductor wafer is extremely      improved in production and labor cost. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  This invention relates to a method and apparatus for mounting a piece of      thin slice-base on a semiconductor wafer, which was processed in advance      of being sliced from a crude material, such as silicon ingot or the like,      and further processed to form impurity diffusion layers on both sides in      advance, of slicing, and more particularly, for mounting the slice-base      chip on the peripheral edge of the semiconductor wafer for protecting the      lower end of the semiconductor wafer from any chipping off during the      re-slicing process from a sheet of the semiconductor wafer into two sheets      for the purpose of manufacturing a substrate for a discrete component,      which is used for a transister, diode, discrete component or the like. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  The applicant of the present invention previously suggested, in his      Japanese patent provisional application No. Hei 1-293613, and also from      other prior art, such as the Japanese patent provisional application No.      Sho 64-19729 or U.S. Pat. No. 4,261,781, that the idea of manufacturing      substrates for discrete components by re-slicing a sheet of a      semiconductor wafer, which is formed with an impurity diffusion layer on      both sides in advance, into two sheets from substantially the center      portion of core thickness of the sheet in order to obtain two sheets of      wafers, having an impurity diffusion layer on one side and a plane surface      on the other side; however, there is no suggestion to mount any thin slice      bases on the periphery of the semiconductor wafer upon the completion of      re-slicing process in the above prior art. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, the applicant of the present invention also suggested, in his      Japanese patent application No. Hei 1-137037, a technology for re-slicing      a semiconductor wafer having impurity diffusion layers on both sides of      the wafer processed in advance before the re-slicing process in order to      improve the productivity of producing the semiconductor wafer. </PAR><PAR>  In the aforementioned suggestions by the applicant, as a suggested means of      mounting the slice base on the peripheral edge of the wafer, for example,      the slice base is mounted with one wafer by using an adhesive on the      peripheral edge of the wafer, which is aligned in advance on a wafer      magazine. </PAR><PAR>  This conventional means, however, has the following disadvantages as shown      in FIG. 1: a slice base(P) tends to incline in advance from a wafer(W)      until an adhesive(C) has been solidified, wherein a shortage of adhesive      strength and errors in the accuracy of measurements between them are      caused, or as shown in FIG. 2, an adhesive falls in drops downwardly along      a wafer surface wherein it causes an irregularity on the surface of the      wafer to spoil the workabilities of subsequent processes. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In accordance with the present invention, a method and apparatus are      provided for mounting a slice base capable of solving the aforementioned      disadvantages with good workability when the slice base is mounted on the      semiconductor wafer. </PAR><PAC>  OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Accordingly, it is a general object of the present invention to provide a      process for forming a reinforcing material on a semiconductor wafer by      using the reinforcing material as a substitute for the aforementioned      slice base to improve the workability of the slicing process of a wafer      with a good finish as well as to save the material cost. </PAR><PAR>  It is a more specific object of the present invention to provide a process      and apparatus for forming the reinforcing material, which is capable of      performing a means of forming the reinforcing material at high accuracy      and high workability. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of the present invention to provide a structure for      mounting a slice base to a semiconductor wafer by enlarging the contact      area of the interface between the slice base and the semiconductor wafer      for enhancing the contact strength between them. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 are side views for showing the disadvantages of      conventional art relating to fixing a slice base on a semiconductor wafer;

The spacing wafer(1) is only      operable, to space and separate the semiconductor wafers from each other.      These two kinds of wafers are aligned one by one vertically in a concave      groove(2') of a wafer bed(2), so as to place two sheets of spacing      wafers(1) (1) on both sides to align these wafers (W) (1) as shown in FIG.      3. </PAR><PAR>  Regarding the material of these wafers(W) (1), the wafer(W) includes a      single crystal silicon ingot and is formed as a disk shape sheet, and is      further processed or doped in advance of re-slicing to have impurity      diffusion layers on both sides of the wafer. </PAR><PAR>  The material of spacing wafer(1) is made from a material which does not      receive any influence from the adhesive(C); for example, it is selected      from a group consisting of a tetrafluoride ethylene resin, and the spacing      wafer(1) is formed so as to closely contact the semiconductor wafer(W).      The material of the wafer bed(2) may be made of an adequate material, and      preferably made of the same material as the spacing wafer(1), so as to not      receive any influence from the adhesive(C). </PAR><PAR>  In addition, pressing plates(3) (3) are provided to press the aligned      wafers(W) (1) on the wafer bed(2) toward the inside from both sides, so as      to hold the wafers' alignment between both pressing plates(3) (3). The      material of the pressing plates(3) (3) may be made of a suitable material,      and preferably made by the same material as the spacing wafer(1). To press      the aligned wafers(W) (1), it is necessary to prevent these wafers(W) (1)      from inclining and diverging movement of each wafer by pressing and      holding these wafers in alignment as well as to reduce any gap occurring      between them by contacting them as closely as possible. </PAR><PAR>  Thereafter, as shown in FIGS. 3, 4 and 5, an adhesive(C) is applied thickly      on the peripheral edge surfaces of the semiconductor wafers(W) which are      held between both spacing wafers(1) (1) wherein a slice base(P) is      inserted between both spacing wafers(1) (1) to mount the slice base(p) on      the edge surface of the semiconductor wafer(W). </PAR><PAR>  It is preferable to apply the adhesive(C) on the upper edge portion of the      semiconductor wafer(W) and it is also possible to use the orientation flat      of the semiconductor wafer(W). It is also possible to apply the      adhesive(C) in advance to the slice base but not to the semiconductor      wafer(W). </PAR><PAR>  Regarding the material of the slice base(P), it is made of a carbon, a      silicon, a quick hardening type cement or the like. As to the material of      the adhesive(C), it is possible to use a thermosetting resin type adhesive      such as an epoxy type resin, polyester type resin which has a good      exfoliation property without losing scission property, a polyamid type      resin or the like, and is also possible to use a rubber type adhesive. </PAR><PAR>  According to the first example, since the spacing wafers(1) have a larger      diameter than the semiconductor wafer(W), they can assist to align and      restrict the semiconductor wafer(W) with the slice base(1) by pressing      from both sides. The plurality of semiconductor wafers(W) with the slice      base(P) can be fixed at an accurate position on the wafer bed(2) without      any damage to the semiconductor wafers(W) with the slice base(P), and the      shortage of fixing strength and error in the accuracy of measurement      caused by the movement, incline, divergence or the like. In addition,      since the combination of spacing wafers(1) put a sheet of semiconductor      wafer(W) between the spacing wafers(1) on both sides, it can prevent the      adhesive(C) from falling in drops along both sides of the semiconductor      wafer(W) by the existence of such spacing wafers(1) closely contacting the      semiconductor wafer(W), even if the adhesive(C) is overflows due to an      excessive application to the edge surface of the semiconductor wafer(W).      (shown in FIG. 5) </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, refer in detail to the re-slicing process of a      semiconductor wafers(W) with a respective slice base(P) aligned on the      wafer bed(2) in combination with the spacing wafers(1) of the first      example. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 it shows an enlarged semiconductor wafer(W), which includes the      impurity diffusion layers(Wb) processed in advance on both sides of the      wafer(W) and a plane core portion(Wa) having no impurity diffusion      layer(Wb), and which is re-sliced by a slicing machine such as ID saw      slicing machine, the ID saw being shown by the reference number(4) in FIG.      6. This semiconductor wafer(W) is further re-sliced by the ID saw(4) to      divide it into two sheets of semiconductor wafers(W') having respective      impurity diffusion layer(Wb) on one side and a plane surface(Wa') on the      other side; that is, two sheets of substrates(W') (W') of discrete      components can be produced simultaneously from one sheet of semiconductor      wafer(W) having impurity diffusion layers(Wb) on both which are processed      in advance. </PAR><PAR>  This re-slicing process necessitates kerf loss of wafer material during the      cutting process by the saw; however, this re-slicing process still has an      advantage of the loss of material in comparison with the conventional      method which the inventor referred to in his previous patent application. </PAR><PAR>  In the practice of the above re-slicing process, either one of the      semiconductor wafer(W) or ID saw(4) may move, and it may slice off      completely throughout the wafer portion and slice base portion together or      selectively slice off the wafer portion and further cut off the slice base      by half so as to remain the other half base portion as shown in FIG. 7.      According to this half slicing process of the slice base(P), it is      effective to improve the workability of unloading the wafers(W) which are      re-sliced from the slicing machine without a separation operation of two      sheets of wafers(W), because of the incorporation of them at the remaining      slice base(P). This re-slicing process, shown in FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, should      be commonly practiced even in the subsequent example to be disclosed      hereafter; however, the explanation of such the re-slicing process in      FIGS. 6 and 7 will be omitted in the following example to avoid duplicate      explanations. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE II </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 8 to FIG. 11 show the second example of the present invention, which      relates to a process and apparatus for mounting a slice base on a      semiconductor wafer. </PAR><PAR>  The second example refers to this example in accordance with the same      reference numbers as in the first example, such as the semiconductor      wafer(W), slice base(P) and adhesive(C), since the second example      comprises materially the same members as the first example. </PAR><PAR>  Firstly, the process for mounting a slice base in the second example is      described. The major difference between the first and second examples is      to use or not use a spacing wafer(1) when the slicing base(P) is applied      on the peripheral edge of a semiconductor wafer(W) by using the      adhesive(C). As shown in FIG. 8, the second example does not use any      spacing wafer(1) at all. </PAR><PAR>  It provides two types of rack magazines, such as a wafer rack magazine(12)      and a slice base rack magazine(11) for loading the semiconductor wafer(W)      and the slice base(P) into each rack groove, respectively, wherein they      are correctly aligned and then the adhesive(C) is applied on the upper end      of slice base(P), wherein the wafer rack magazine(12) is engaged to the      slice base rack magazine(11). This feature is the outline of the process      for mounting a slice base on a semiconductor wafer in the second example.      In FIGS. 9 and 10, the adhesion between the bottom of semiconductor      wafer(W) and the upper end of slice base(P) with the adhesive(C) is      achieved by the dead weight of the wafer(W) itself, naturally without any      mechanical pressure in response to the engagement between both magazines.      As an option, in FIGS. 9 and 10, it may be possible to load the      semiconductor wafer(W) into the wafer rack magazine(12) by making the      orientation flat(Wo) portion face downwardly so as to contact the slice      base(P) through the adhesive(C). </PAR><PAR>  The process in the second example has the following advantages in that the      semiconductor wafer(W) is mounted securely on the slice base(P) through      the adhesive(C) without any movement; incline or divergence in the      alignment, consequently it can prevent the semiconductor wafer(W) with the      slice base(P) from any shortage of fixing strength or error in the      accuracy of measurement. In addition, since the semiconductor wafer(W) is      mounted on the slice base(P), it can prevent the semiconductor wafer(W)      from the dirt of adhesive(C) caused by falling in drops if excessive      adhesive(C) is applied on the upper end of the slice base(P). </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 shows a thicker slice base(P) having a larger core thickness than      the core thickness of semiconductor wafer(W). According to this thicker      slice base(P), it can prevent an adhesive(C) from over-flow to the outside      if the adhesive(C) is excessively applied on the slice base(P) and in      contrast it improves the fixing strength between the semiconductor      wafer(W) and the slice base(P) by the excessive application of the      adhesive(C). </PAR><PAR>  An apparatus for mounting the semiconductor wafer(W) on the upper end of      slice base(P) in accordance with the above process of the second example      based on FIGS. 8 to 10 is now described. </PAR><PAR>  The apparatus of the second example comprises wafer rack magazine(12)      shaped as a box and a slice base rack magazine(11) shaped as a rack gear      as shown in FIGS. 8 to 10. The wafer magazine body(15) of the wafer rack      magazine(12) has a plurality of rack grooves(16) in both interior walls      which are opposed each other in the magazine body(15). The rack      grooves(16) are formed with a predetermined number and interval so as to      receive a predetermined number of semiconductor wafers(W) capable of      taking out and putting into the rack grooves(16) which are also formed to      meet with the other rack grooves(14) of the slice base rack magazine(11).      The bottom portion(17) of the wafer magazine body(15) is formed to be      fully opened so as to accept the other slice base rack magazine(11) </PAR><PAR>  The slice base rack magazine(11) has also a predetermined number of rack      grooves(14) formed upward from the bottom portion(13) so as to meet with      the above rack grooves(16) of the wafer rack magazine(12) to receive a      predetermined number of slice bases(P) capable of taking out and putting      into the rack grooves(14). </PAR><PAR>  To secure the accuracy of engagement between both magazines(12)(11), the      wafer rack magazine(12) has a plurality of guide pins(18b) projected at      adequate positions on the bottom surface of the wafer magazine body(15) to      engage with a plurality of guide holes(18a) bored at suitable      positions(18) on the upper surface of the slice base rack magazine(11),      other than at the rack grooves(14). </PAR><PAR>  During the engagement of both magazines(12)(11), the predetermined number      of semiconductor wafers(W) and the same number of slice bases(P) are      respectively loaded into each magazine(12)(11) and these magazines(12)(11)      are engaged together by engaging the guide pins(18b) with the guide      holes(18a) after the application of the adhesive(C) on each upper end of      slice base(P). During engagement of the both magazines(12)(11), the slice      base(P) is fixed with the bottom edge of semiconductor wafer(W) so as to      push up the semiconductor wafer(W) by the slice base(P) as shown in FIG.      10, and then the adhesion of both materials are achieved by the dead      weight of semiconductor wafer(W) itself. Depending on the properties of      adhesive(C), the hardening of adhesive(C) can be accelerated by heating      the whole magazines(12)(11) containing the materials(W)(P) in a heating      oven or the like. Upon completion of fixing the both materials(W)(P), they      can be taken out from the upper side. </PAR><PAR>  Regarding the material of making both magazines(12)(11), they may be made      of an adequate material, which does not receive any adhesive influence      from the adhesive(C), preferably, such as a tetrafluoride ethylene resin.      In addition, an ordinal wafer magazine may be employed as a substitute for      the wafer rack magazine(12). </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE III </PAC><PAR>  FIGS. 12 to 16 show the third example of the present invention which      relates to an improved structure of the slice base(P) commonly used in the      first and second examples as aforementioned. </PAR><PAR>  In the third example, which is shown in FIG. 13, a slice base(P') includes      an U-shaped slit(21) in section view, which is prepared to receive a      peripheral edge(20) of semiconductor wafer(W) along the upper portion(22)      of the slice base(P') having the U-shaped slit(21). FIG. 12 shows a slice      base(P') to be mounted on the circular arc(20') shaped peripheral edge(20)      of the semiconductor wafer(W); therefore, the upper portion(22) with the      U-shaped slit(21) is formed as a circular arc to meet with the circular      arc shaped peripheral edge of the semiconductor wafer(W). FIG. 14 shows      another slice base(P') to meet with the orientation flat(Wo) edge of the      semiconductor wafer(W). </PAR><PAR>  The adhesion of both materials such as the semiconductor wafer(W) and the      slice base(P') is achieved in accordance with the processes for mounting      the slice base(P) on the semiconductor wafer(W) disclosed in the first and      second examples; that is, a comparatively thicker adhesion(C) is applied      at the bottom of U-shaped slit(21) and then a semiconductor wafer(W) is      inserted into the bottom of U-shaped slit(21), wherein they are fixed. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 15 shows a modified slice base(P&quot;) having an L-shaped step portion. In      this case, it is advantageous that the workability of making such an      L-shaped step type slice base(P&quot;) is comparatively easier than making the      U-shaped slit type slice base(P'). Depending on the slicing method, it is      sometimes required to fix two sheets of the semiconductor wafer(W) on the      step portion of one piece of slice base(P&quot;); however, the requirement can      be solved easily by enlarging the width of the terrace portion of the      L-shaped step type slice base(P&quot;). </PAR><PAR>  According to the third examples, such as the U-shaped slit type slice      base(P') and the L-shaped step type slice base(P&quot;), since the      semiconductor wafer(W) is engaged closely with the interior wall      surfaces(21) of the slit type slice base(P') or the one side wall      surface(24) of the step type slice base(P&quot;) through the adhesive(C), the      semiconductor wafer(W) can be fixed with not only the bottom(20) of the      slit but also both sides(21)(21) of the interior wall surfaces(21) in FIG.      16, or not only the step(20) of the step type slice base(P&quot;), but also one      side surface(24) through the adhesive(C), wherein the fixing areas of both      type slice bases(P') (P&quot;) are enlarged so as to increase their fixing      strength. Further, depending on the material properties or viscosities of      the adhesive(C), the adhesive(C) forms boss portions(23) which are pushed      out by the pressure of insertion between the upper ends of slice bases(P')      (P&quot;) and both sides of the semiconductor wafer(W), wherein the boss      portions(23) are effective to further increase the fixing strength between      both materials. (FIGS. 13, 15 and 16) </PAR><PAR>  Thus, the semiconductor wafer(W) with the U-shaped slit type slice base(P')      and/or the L-shaped step type slice base(P&quot;) is further processed to be      re-sliced into two sheets of semiconductor wafer(W') having one side      having a plane surface without any impurity diffusion layer and the other      side with an impurity diffusion layer processed or doped in advance by      using the re-slicing machine referred to in the first and second examples      as shown in FIGS. 6, 7 and 16. FIG. 16 corresponds to FIG. 7 and shows a      feature of slicing the slice bases(P') (P&quot;) up to the half way position of      the of slice bases upon the completion of slicing the whole semiconductor      wafer(W). </PAR><PAR>  In one of the semiconductor wafers(W') with the U-shaped slit type slice      base(P') after being re-sliced up to the half way position of slice      base(P') in FIG. 16, the adhesion between the wafer(W') and the half way      slit base(P') is still securely maintained along L-shaped interface      between the wafer(W') and the slit base(P'). In FIG. 16, during the      re-slicing process by ID saw(4) of slicing machine, the wafer(W) is going      to separate by the slicing down movement of the ID saw so as to divide the      wafer(W) into two sheets of wafers(W'). In addition, the core thickness of      the slice base(P') is thicker than the core thickness of the wafer(W);      therefore, the core portion of the U-shaped slit type slice base(P') can      be held securely without any breakdown even if it is slit up to the half      way position of the slice base(P'). </PAR><PAR>  In the re-slicing process of the L-shaped step type slice base(P&quot;) in FIG.      15, comparing the step type slice base(P&quot;) with the above slit type slice      base(P'), the step type(P&quot;) would be disadvantageous because of the      difference of the shape between U-shape and L-shape when they are      re-sliced from their center; however, the disadvantage can be overcome if      a special type chucking instrument is provided for chucking one side of      the slice base(P&quot;). (not shown in the drawing) </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLES IV AND V </PAC><PAR>  The highlight of examples IV and V is to mold an adhesive(C'), which is a      quick-drying type viscous liquid material, into a slice base on the upper      end of the wafer(W) which is held between both spacing wafers(1), by      pouring the liquid material into the space provided between both spacing      wafer(1) as a substitute for those solid type slice bases(P)(P')(P&quot;), as      shown in example IV of FIGS. 17 to 20 and example V of FIGS. 21 to 30. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE IV </PAC><PAR>  Referring now in detail to example IV, according to FIGS. 17 to 20, the      practice of example IV is followed in accordance with example I in FIGS. 3      to 4; that is, it comprises two kinds of wafers such as a plurality of      semiconductor wafer(W) and a plurality of spacing wafer(1) having a larger      diameter than the semiconductor wafer. The spacing wafer(1) is only      operable to space and separate semiconductor wafers from each other.      Providing these two kinds wafers and aligning them one by one vertically      in a concave groove(2') of an wafer bed(2) so as to place two sheets of      spacing wafers(1)(1) on both sides of the aligned wafers(W)(1) is shown in      FIG. 3. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, pressing plates (3)(3) are provided to press the aligned      wafers(W)(1) on the wafer bed(2) toward inside from both sides so as to      hold the wafers' alignments both pressing plates(3)(3). </PAR><PAR>  Regarding the composition of the adhesive(C'), it is made of adding a      filler such as talc powder, aluminum oxide powder or graphite powder with      an epoxy resin type adhesive wherein they are regulated to have an      adequate viscosity and adhesive property. Thus, this adhesive(C') is      poured into a bottom space provided between both spacing wafers(1)(1), the      bottom of space being also the peripheral edge of the semiconductor      wafer(W), and the adhesive(C') is formed into a crescent shaped slice      base(30) fixed on the peripheral edge of the semiconductor wafer(W), as      shown in FIGS. 17 and 18 to solidify the adhesive(C'), and preferably put      them into an oven so as to shorten the solidification time. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 19 and 20 show a modified crescent shaped slice base(30) for further      improving the fixing strength between the slice base(30) and the wafer(W)      by processing additional modifications upon the peripheral edge of the      semiconductor wafer(W) or the opposed surfaces of spacing wafers(1)(1). </PAR><PAR>  In the additional modification upon the semiconductor wafer(W) in FIG. 19,      a slit(32) is provided on the peripheral edge of the semiconductor      wafer(W) so as to increase the interface area of mold type slice base(30)      with the semiconductor wafer(W). </PAR><PAR>  In the other additional modification upon the opposed surfaces of spacing      wafers(1)(1) in FIG. 20, the thickness of the upper portions of spacing      wafers(1)(1) are reduced to provide additional spaces between the reduced      surfaces of spacing wafers(1')(1') to receive the mold type slice base(30)      so as to cover the upper end of the semiconductor wafer(W) as shown in      FIG. 20. The fixing strength between the mold type slice base(30) and the      semiconductor wafer(W), even after the semiconductor wafer(W) being      re-sliced into two sheets, the fixing strength the re-sliced mold type      slice base(P) and the re-sliced semiconductor wafer(W') can be well      maintained due to the sufficient thickness of the re-sliced mold type      slice base(30). As an additional advantage, this process can easily widen      the range of covering the lower periphery of semiconductor wafer during      the last portion of re-slicing process by enlarging the size of molding      type slice base, wherein this process is extremely effective for the      re-slicing process of a thin type semiconductor wafer which is easily      chipped off around the lower periphery portion. </PAR><PAR>  The feature of FIGS. 19 and 20, as an option, can load two sheets of      semiconductor wafers(W)(W) into the molding type slice base, and can      re-slice them in order, depending on the preparation of a modified slicing      machine having two loaders with vacuum cups opposed each other between the      two sheets of semiconductor wafers(W)(W), which are capable of chucking      one side to re-slice firstly and then chucking the other side to re-slice      later. (not shown in the drawings) </PAR><PAR>  According to this example IV of using the mold type slice base(30), since      the spacing wafers(1) have a larger diameter than the semiconductor      wafer(W) and can assist to align and restrict the semiconductor wafer(W)      with the mold type slice base(30) formed by pouring the adhesive(C') into      the space formed between both spacing wafers(1)(1), the plurality of      semiconductor wafers(W) with the slice base(30) can be fixed at accurate      positions on the wafer bed(2) without any damage of the semiconductor      wafers(W) with the slice base(30), the shortage of fixing strength and      error in the accuracy of measurement caused by the movement, incline,      divergence or the like. In addition, there is no fear that a semiconductor      wafer having a large size diameter and a thin thickness would be broken      during pressing process from the both sides because the full surfaces of      semiconductor wafers are held by spacing wafers, and also no fear that the      adhesive(C') is falls out in drops along the surfaces of semiconductor      wafers(W) because they are closely contacted by the spacing wafers on both      sides by pressure. In addition, since the adhesive(C') can be easily      filled to cover the peripheral edge of semiconductor wafer(W) over the      wide area of interface by utilizing the flowability of the adhesive(C'),      no loss of the crude material of slice base(P)(P')(P&quot;) is produced during      the cutting process of the crude material into each piece of the slice      base, whereby it can save the material cost in the example IV. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE V </PAC><PAR>  FIGS. 21 to 30 show example V of a process and apparatus for forming      another mold type slice base(40). Referring now to the apparatus for      forming the mold type slice base(40), this apparatus comprises a wafer      magazine(A.sub.1) to hold a plurality of semiconductor wafer(W) aligned in      an upright position and a mold bed(A.sub.2) having a plurality of molding      grooves(45) to form slice bases(40) from the adhesive(C'). This mold      bed(A.sub.2) is purposed to receive the bottom of wafer magazine(A.sub.1).      The wafer magazine(A.sub.1) is made of a resin, which has a specified      property of not receiving adhesive influence from the adhesive(C'), such      as a resin selected from the group consisting of a tetrafluoride ethylene      resin. The wafer magazine(A.sub.1) is formed as a box body(41) having a      plurality of guide slits(42) opposedly provided in both side interior      walls of the body wall(41a) to receive the plurality of semiconductor      wafers(W) by inserting the wafers(W) vertically along the guide slits(42). </PAR><PAR>  The body walls(41a) of the box body(41) are made to dogleg inwardly toward      each other with the same guide slits(42), the body walls(41a) extend from      the leg portions(41C)(41C) which form a bottom opening((41b) along the      longitudinal direction of the box body(41) to engage with the mold      bed(A.sub.2) so as to cover the box body(41) of the wafer      magazine(A.sub.1) on the mold bed(A.sub.2). </PAR><PAR>  The mold bed(A.sub.2) provides a mold portion(44) with molding grooves(45)      on the base plate(43) of the mold bed(A.sub.2) for receiving the bottom      edge of the semiconductor wafer(W) on the upper surface of the mold      bed(A.sub.2). The molding grooves(45) of the mold bed(A.sub.2) are made in      the same shape and pitch as the other guide slits(42) of the wafer      magazine(A.sub.1) so as to receive the semiconductor wafer(W) when the      wafer magazine(A.sub.1) and the mold bed(A.sub.2) are engaged together.      The base plate(43) of the mold bed(A.sub.2) has grooves for engagement(50)      in both sides of the base plate(43) to engage with the lower ends of the      legs portions(41C) of the wafer magazine(A.sub.1). </PAR><PAR>  Regarding the formation of the mold portion(44) with the molding      grooves(45), the mold portion(44) is formed as a concave circular arc so      as to almost meet with or be in excess of the circle of the semiconductor      wafer(W) and the molding grooves(45) are formed as a circular arc along      the concave circular arc of the mold portion(44) to be receive the      adhesive for forming the mold type slice bases(40) to fixed with the      bottom edge of the semiconductor wafer(W). </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 26 and FIG. 29, the shape of the molding grooves(45) may be formed      as an enlarged trapezoidal shape capable of covering the lower end of the      semiconductor wafer(W) by the adhesive(C'). </PAR><PAR>  In addition, both ends of the molding grooves(45) provide V-shaped guide      slits(46) for supporting the peripheral edge of the semiconductor wafer(W)      from the lower portion. As shown in FIGS. 27 and 28, the V-shaped guide      slits(46) are formed so as to deepen the V-shape slit inwardly from the      outside, and are formed along the circular arc of the molding grooves(45)      of the mold portion(44) on plate members(48) which are fixed by screws      with both sides of the mold portion(44). The center line of the V-shaped      guide slits(46) is made to meet with the center line of the molding      grooves(45); therefore, each semiconductor wafer(W) is positioned at the      center lines by engaging the wafer magazine(A.sub.1) with the mold      bed(A.sub.2). The molding grooves(45) form the mold type slice bases(40)      along the peripheral edge of the semiconductor wafer(W) by pouring and to      solidify the adhesive(C') into the molding grooves(45); therefore, the      mold type slice bases(40) can be formed with high accuracy along the      peripheral portion of the semiconductor wafer(W) by supporting the      peripheral edge portion of the semiconductor wafer(W) at the center line      of the V-shaped guide slits(46). </PAR><PAR>  In addition, the plate members(48) to be fixed with the both sides of the      mold portion to be adjustable up and down by loosening the screws(47),      wherein it is possible to adjust the inserting depth of the lower      peripheral edge of semiconductor wafer(W) into the molding grooves(45) by      adjusting the plate members(48) up and down so that it is then possible to      vary the inserting depth of the semiconductor wafer(W) to the mold type      slice base(40). </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 23 shows another example of the mold portion of the mold bed(A.sub.2).      In FIG. 23, molding grooves(45') are formed deeper downwardly with a      smaller circular arc than the wafer's circular arc, wherein the mold type      slice base(40') is formed as a slice base having a deeper depth at the      central portion. Both sides of the molding grooves(45') provide V-shaped      guide slits(46') as shown in FIGS. 24 and 25. By forming the slice      base(40') with the wide depth at the central portion to fix with the      semiconductor wafer(W), the slice base(40') can still hold two sheets of a      re-sliced semiconductor wafer(W')(W') on the slice base(40') upon the      completion of re-slicing process of the wafer(W); therefore, it is      advantageous that it can unload the re-sliced wafers(W')(W') at the same      time upon the completion of the re-slicing process. This type mold      bed(A.sub.2) is, therefore, suitable for such an unloading method without      separation of two sheets. </PAR><PAR>  The above type mold bed(A.sub.2) provides an insert core(49) separated from      the base plate(43) so as to close the other opening portion located under      the molding grooves(45'). This insert core(49) is operable to take out      from the base plate(43) upon the completion of molding process of the      slice base(40'). After the taking out the insert core(49), the      semiconductor wafer(W) with the mold type slice base(40') is unloaded by      pushing up from the bottom portion through the opening of the base      plate(43). By pushing up the slice base(40'), the semiconductor wafer(W)      is unloaded from the wafer magazine(A.sub.2) without causing any damage to      the wafer's surfaces(W). In addition, both sides of the molding      grooves(45') provide V-shaped guide slits(46') formed as extending the      circular arc of the molding grooves(45') as shown in FIGS. 24 and 25. </PAR><PAR>  The method for forming the mold type slice base(40') in the example V by      using the aforementioned apparatus(A) for forming the slice base(40') is      now described. </PAR><PAR>  In the method, plurality of the semiconductor wafers(W) are loaded into the      wafer magazine(A.sub.1) in the same pitch with each other along the guide      slits(42) as the orientation flat(Wo) of the semiconductor wafer(W) being      positioned in the upper state. In this state, the lower peripheral edges      of the semiconductor wafers(W) are inserted along the guide slits(42) on      both sides of the wafer magazine(A.sub.1) and then the semiconductor      wafers(W) are held vertically without any backlash in the wafer      magazine(A.sub.1) by holding both side peripheral edges of the      semiconductor wafer(W) in both side interior walls(41a). </PAR><PAR>  A hardening type resin as a crude material to form the slice base(40) is      filled into each molding groove(45') of the mold bed(A.sub.2) to be      inserted into the bottom opening(41b) of the wafer magazine(A.sub.1). The      hardening type resin is selected from the group consisting of an epoxy      resin mixture such as a thermosetting resin mixed with talc powder,      aluminum oxide powder or graphite powder as a filler for providing a      certain viscosity of not flowing out when filled in the molding      grooves(45'), wherein the hardening type resin is filled to the upper      limit of each molding groove(45') while drawing attention to not insert      any air bubble into the molding resin by using an instrument for filling      the resin. (FIG. 26) </PAR><PAR>  The wafer magazine(A.sub.1) and the molding bed(A.sub.2) are engaged so as      to cover the opening portion(41b) of the wafer magazine(A.sub.1) on the      molding portion(44) of the molding bed(A.sub.2) to insert the lower ends      of the legs portions(41c) of the wafer magazine(A.sub.1) into the      receiving grooves(50), wherein the lower peripheral edges of the      semiconductor wafer(W) are inserted into the molding grooves(45') of the      molding bed(A.sub.2) by the dead weight of the wafer itself or suitable      pressurization from the upper side. (FIG. 21) </PAR><PAR>  In the above case, the lower peripheral edge of the semiconductor wafer(W)      is inserted into V-shaped guide slits(46) of the both side of the molding      grooves(45'), and supported from the lower portion, wherein the lower      peripheral edge of the semiconductor wafer(W) is positioned at the central      line of the molding grooves(45') and then covered by the adhesive(C')      which is filled into the molding grooves(45') with a predetermined      depth(b). When the lower peripheral edge of the semiconductor wafer(W) is      inserted into the adhesive resin filled in the molding grooves(45'), the      resin rises at both sides of the wafer(W) and the raised portions are      formed with the acute angle (Q) causing by the sufficient viscosity and      the surface tension as shown in FIG. 29, and then the raised portions are      kept as they are. </PAR><PAR>  The inserting depth of the lower peripheral edge of the semiconductor      wafer(W) into the molding grooves(45') can be adjustable by moving the      plate member(48) up and down. The molding adhesive filled into the molding      grooves(45') together with the lower peripheral edge of the semiconductor      wafer(W) is thermally solidified in an environment having a predetermined      temperature. After the solidification, the wafer(W) with the solidified      slice base(40) is unloaded from the wafer magazine(A.sub.1) by separating      the wafer magazine from the molding bed(A.sub.2). In addition, the      exfoliation of the slice base(40) from the molding grooves(45') can be      achieved easily by using a high exfoliation type resin, however, it may be      further useful to employ an exfoliating agent to coat the interior      surfaces of the molding grooves(45') in advance. The slice base(40) made      of the resin and formed around the peripheral edges of the semiconductor      wafer(W) is formed so as to cover both surfaces of the peripheral edges of      the semiconductor wafer(W) as shown in FIG. 29. The semiconductor wafer(W)      unloaded from the molding bed(A.sub.2) is further transferred to the      cutting process for dividing the unloaded wafer(W) into two sheets, and      the wafer magazine(A.sub.1) and the molding bed(A.sub.2) are repeatedly      used. </PAR><PAR>  According to the aforementioned process for forming the slice base, it can      mold the slice base(40) to incorporate with the lower peripheral edge of      the semiconductor wafer(W) without making by hand as the wafers(W) are      loaded within the magazine(A.sub.1). Therefore, it can form the slice      base(40) with high accuracy by saving manual labor as well as can reduce      the flow out of the adhesive which has occurred conventionally and further      reduce the damage during the handling of the wafer(W). In addition, it can      save the material cost since such a ready made type slice base is      comparatively expensive but this invention does not employ such an      expensive type slice base. </PAR><PAR>  In the re-slicing process, the above semiconductor wafer(W) with the slice      base(40) is re-sliced into two sheets from the center portion of the core      thickness of the wafer(W) by using an ID saw or the like, however, it can      prevent the wafer(W) effectively from the damage for the end portion of      the wafer(W) caused by the cutting pressure by the squeezing of the saw      into the core since the lower peripheral edge of the semiconductor      wafer(W) is reinforced so as to cover the lower end by the slice base(40)      as shown in FIG. 29. </PAR><PAR>  Upon the completion of the re-slicing process, a mold-releasing agent is      impregnated into the joint portion between the lower end of the wafer(W)      and the mold type slice base(40) for removing the slice base(40) which is      already unnecessary from the lower end of the wafers(W) which has been      re-sliced into two sheets. In the impregnation of the mold-releasing agent      into the joint portion, the mold-releasing agent is easily impregnated      into the joint portion since the joint portions are formed with the acute      angle(Q) degree causing by the sufficient viscosity and the surface      tension as shown in FIG. 29, in addition it is advantageous that it can      remove the slice base(40) easily from the lower end of the wafer(W) since      the mold type slice base(40) is pressed by external force under favorable      conditions as a force to allow the wafer to be released from the slice      base(40). </PAR><PAR>  In the re-slicing process of the wafer(W), the wafer(W) is re-sliced by the      ID saw while the wafer(W) is held by a vacuum chuck equipped with the      slicing machine after being loaded on the vacuum chuck by a loader(i.e. an      wafer loading manipulator having a vacuum cup on the end of manipulator).      In the loading or unloading operation of the wafer(W), it appears      disadvantageous that the vacuum chuck or cup would be unable to chuck the      whole surface of the wafer(W) because of the structure of the mold type      slice base(40) formed with one step projecting outwardly from the wafer      surface, however, it is proven that there is no problem to chuck the wafer      portion other than the projecting portion of the slice base(40). </PAR><PAR>  According to the above process for forming the mold type slice base, as      shown in FIG. 30, it can form a slice base(40&quot;) for covering the lower      peripheral edges of two sheets or more than two sheets of the      semiconductor wafer(W). </PAR><PAR>  In addition, there are two method to completely re-slice the wafer(W)      together with the slice base(40) into two sheets, and/or to re-slice the      wafer(W) with half of slice base(40) to remain with the last part of the      slice base(40) to hold the re-sliced two sheets of the slice base(40)      wherein it can unload the two sheets of the wafer(W')(W'). In the former      method, the slice base is formed with the same width as the slice base(40)      formed in the molding grooves(45) of the molding bed(A.sub.2), and in the      latter method, it can correspond by enlarging the width of the central      portion to be sliced such as the slice base(40') formed in the molding      grooves(45') of the molding bed(A.sub.2). In case of enlarging the      reinforcing range of the slice base(40), or in case of forming the slice      base(40) along the orientation flat(Wo) of the semiconductor wafer(W), it      can correspond by changing the form of the molding grooves of the molding      bed. </PAR><PAR>  Regarding the wafer magazine(A.sub.1), a general type article on the market      is adaptable, however, it is suggested to use a specially designed wafer      magazine in case of forming a slice base with a wide range such as to form      two sheets of the wafer(W) at the same time, or to form a slice base for a      specially thickened wafer, or specially thickened peripheral edge portion. </PAR><PAR>  According to the apparatus referred to in example V, a plurality of      semiconductor wafers are aligned to vertically hold in an wafer magazine,      the lower peripheral edges of these wafer being inserted into molding      grooves having a concave circular arc shape of a molding bed respectively.
