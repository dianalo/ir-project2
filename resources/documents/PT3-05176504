A controlling section calculates extra      horse powers .DELTA.HP.sub.1 and .DELTA.HP.sub.2 based on reference      allowable absorptive horse powers set relative to the first and second      hydraulic pumps and actual absorptive horse powers (HP.sub.01) and      (HP.sub.02) derived from the first and second hydraulic pumps. In      addition, the controlling section calculates allowable discharge      capacities (V.sub.1P) and (V.sub.2P) based on the number (N) of      revolutions of the engines, pressures (P.sub.1) and (P.sub.2) of hydraulic      oils discharged from the first and second hydraulic pumps, the extra horse      powers .DELTA.HP.sub.1 and .DELTA.HP.sub.2 and allowable discharge      capacities (V.sub.1P) and (V.sub.2P). Then, the controlling section      selects a smaller one of a target discharge capacity and the allowable      discharge capacity (V.sub.1P) and a smaller one of another target      discharge capacity and the allowable discharge capacity (V.sub.2P) as      minimum target discharge capacities (V.sub.1) and (V.sub.2). Thereafter,      the controlling section controls swash plate angles of the first and      second hydraulic pumps such that the minimum target discharge capacities      (V.sub.1) and (V.sub.2) are correctly set corresponding to the first and      second hydraulic pumps. Consequently, absorptive horse powers to be      derived from the first and second hydraulic pumps can properly be      controlled while a sum of the reference allowable absorptive horse powers      is kept constant. </PAR></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  TECHNICAL FIELD </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates to an apparatus for controlling hydraulic      pumps which are mounted on a construction machine. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND ART </PAC><PAR>  For example, a construction machine for performing excavating operations is      generally equipped with two variable capacity type hydraulic pumps adapted      to be driven by an engine in order to feed a pressurized hydraulic oil to      hydraulic actuators in the form of hydraulic cylinders, hydraulic motors      or the like. </PAR><PAR>  A technology for varying horse powers to be absorbed by variable capacity      type hydraulic pumps corresponding to a magnitude of load while      maintaining a sum of the absorptive horse powers of the hydraulic pumps at      a level corresponding to a predetermined value has been heretofore      proposed (e.g., refer to Japanese Patent Application NO. 60841/1984). </PAR><PAR>  The foregoing predetermined value is practically set to a value which      represents a rated horse power derived from the engine. </PAR><PAR>  With the prior technology as described above, in a case where one of the      hydraulic pumps has a smaller absorptive horse power, the absorptive horse      power allowable relative to the other hydraulic pump is enhanced      correspondingly. This enables the rated horse power of the engine to be      utilized effectively. </PAR><PAR>  However, it has been found that the prior technology has the following      drawback. </PAR><PAR>  Specifically, since the absorptive horse powers of the respective hydraulic      pumps are not individually monitored, optimum distribution of the      absorptive horse powers relative to the respective hydraulic pumps      sometimes fails to be carried out. </PAR><PAR>  Another drawback of the prior technology is that a controlling operation is      performed with a low accuracy, because the prior technology is practiced      by employing mechanical components. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention has been made with the foregoing background in mind      and its object resides in providing an apparatus for controlling hydraulic      pumps for a construction machine wherein distribution of horse powers to      be absorbed by the hydraulic pumps can adequately be carried out with an      excellent accuracy. </PAR><PAC>  DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  To accomplish the above object, the present invention provides an apparatus      for controlling hydraulic pumps for a construction machine wherein the      construction machine includes first and second hydraulic pumps adapted to      be driven by an engine and hydraulic actuators hydraulically connected to      the first and second hydraulic pumps via first and second actuating      valves, wherein the apparatus includes as essential components engine      revolution number detecting means for detecting the number (N) of      revolutions of the engine, pressure detecting means for detecting      pressures (P.sub.1) and (P.sub.2) of hydraulic oils discharged from the      first and second hydraulic pumps, horse power setting means for presetting      reference absorptive horse powers relative to the first and second      hydraulic pumps, target discharge capacity commanding means for commanding      target discharge quantities (V.sub.1L) and (V.sub.2L) corresponding to      quantities of actuations of the first and second actuating valves,      absorptive horse power calculating means for calculating actual absorptive      horse powers (HP.sub.01) and (HP.sub.02) derived from the first and second      hydraulic pumps, extra horse power calculating means for calculating extra      horse powers (.DELTA.HP.sub.1) and (.DELTA.HP.sub.2) based on the      reference allowable absorptive horse powers and the actual absorptive      horse powers (.DELTA.HP.sub.1) and (.DELTA.HP.sub.2), the extra horse      powers (.DELTA.HP.sub.1) and (.DELTA.HP.sub.2) failing to be absorbed by      the first and second hydraulic pumps, means for calculating allowable      discharge capacities (V.sub.1P) and (V.sub.2P) based on the engine      revolution number (N), the discharge pressures (P.sub.1) and (P.sub.2),      the extra horse powers (.DELTA.HP.sub.1) and (.DELTA.HP.sub.2) and the      reference allowable horse powers relative to the first and second      hydraulic pumps, means for selecting a smaller one of the target discharge      capacity (V.sub.1L) and the allowable discharge capacity (V.sub.1P) and a      smaller one of the target discharge capacity (V.sub.2L) and the allowable      discharge capacity (V.sub.2P) as minimum target discharge capacities      (V.sub.1) and (V.sub.2), and swash plate controlling means for controlling      swash plate angles of the first and second hydraulic pumps such that the      capacities of hydraulic oils discharged from the first and second      hydraulic pumps coincide with the minimum target discharge capacities      (V.sub.1) and (V.sub.2) </PAR><PAR>  According to the present invention, a controlling section individually      monitors the actual absorptive horse powers relative to the first and      second hydraulic pumps, whereby distribution of horse powers to be      absorbed by the respective hydraulic pumps can be carried out adequately.      In addition, since no mechanical component is used for constituting the      apparatus of the present invention, the controlling section can perform a      controlling operation with an excellent accuracy. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is an illustrative view which schematically shows the structure of      an apparatus for controlling hydraulic pumps for a construction machine in      accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 2 is a block      diagram which schematically shows by way of example the structure of a      swash plate controlling section, FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 are a graph which shows      by way of example the relationship between a pressure of hydraulic oil      discharged from a certain hydraulic pump and a capacity of hydraulic oil      discharged from the hydraulic pump so as to allow the hydraulic pump to be      driven with a predetermined absorptive horse power, respectively, and FIG.      5 is an illustrative view which schematically shows a case where a      plurality of hydraulic actuators are hydraulically connected to a single      hydraulic pump. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Now, the present invention will be described in detail hereinafter with      reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate a preferred      embodiment of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is an illustrative view which schematically shows the structure of      an apparatus for controlling hydraulic pumps for a construction machine in      accordance with the embodiment of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 1, actuating levers 1 and 2 are electrically connected to      actuation quantity detectors 3 and 4 each composed of a potentiometer or      the like instrument. A series of signals each having a magnitude and a      polarity corresponding to a quantity of actuation of the actuating lever 1      and a direction of steering induced by the actuating lever 1 are outputted      from the actuation quantity detector 3, while a series of signals each      having a magnitude and a polarity corresponding to a quantity of actuation      of the actuating lever 2 and a direction of steering induced by the      actuating lever 2 are outputted from the actuation quantity detector 4. </PAR><PAR>  These output signals from the actuation quantity detectors 1 and 2 are      sequentially fed to command signal forming sections 5 and 6. </PAR><PAR>  The command signal forming sections 5 and 6 serve to output valve      controlling signals corresponding to magnitudes of output signals and      polarities of the same from the actuation quantity detectors 3 and 4. The      valve controlling signal outputted from the command signal forming section      5 is fed to solenoids 7a and 7b of an actuating valve 7, while the valve      controlling signal outputted from the command signal forming section 6 is      fed to solenoids 8a and 8b of an actuating valve 8. </PAR><PAR>  In addition, the command signal forming sections 5 and 6 output signals for      commanding target discharge capacities V.sub.L1 and V.sub.L2 corresponding      to the output signals from the actuation quantity detectors 3 and 4, and      these command signals are fed to a swash plate controlling section 9 to be      described later. </PAR><PAR>  Hydraulic cylinders 10 and 11 each serving as a hydraulic actuator are      hydraulically connected to variable capacity type hydraulic pumps 12 and      13 via the actuating valves 7 and 8. </PAR><PAR>  With such construction, in a case where the actuating valve 7 is brought in      the state A or the state C as shown in FIG. 1 in response to the valve      controlling signal, the hydraulic cylinder 10 performs an expanding      operation or a retracting operation with the pressurized hydraulic oil      which is discharged from the hydraulic cylinder 10. </PAR><PAR>  Also with respect to the other actuating valve 8, same operations as those      of the actuating valve 7 are performed with the hydraulic cylinder 11. </PAR><PAR>  According to the embodiment of the present invention, the hydraulic      cylinders 10 and 11 serve as a boom cylinder and an arm cylinder for a      hydraulic type excavator. </PAR><PAR>  The variable capacity type hydraulic pumps 12 and 13 and a control pump 14      are driven by an engine 15. </PAR><PAR>  The hydraulic pumps 12 and 13 are provided with swash plates 12a and 13a of      which inclination angle is varied by actuating servo-actuators 16 and 17      for turnably driving the swash plates 12a and 13a. A discharge flow rate      (cc/rev) per a single revolution of each of the hydraulic pumps 12 and 13      increases more and more as an inclination angle of each of the swash      plates 12a and 13a is enlarged. </PAR><PAR>  Incidentally, the inclination angle is hereinafter referred to as a swash      plate angle. </PAR><PAR>  The servo-actuator 16 is composed of a servo-valve 16a for controlling a      flow rate of pressurized hydraulic oil to be discharged from the control      pump 14, a cylinder 16b adapted to be actuated by the pressurized      hydraulic oil controlled by the servo-valve 16a and other associated      components so as to allow the swash plate angle of the hydraulic pump 12      to be set to a magnitude corresponding to the command signal which has      been inputted into the servo-valve 16a. </PAR><PAR>  It should be added that the servo-actuator 17 is composed of a servo-valve      17a, a cylinder 17b and other associated components and functions in the      same manner as the servo-actuator 16. </PAR><PAR>  Pressure detectors 18 and 19 are hydraulically connected to hydraulic      passages of the hydraulic pumps 12 and 13 on the discharge side, and a      rotation sensor 20 for detecting the engine speed of the engine 15 is      arranged at the position in the vicinity of an output shaft 15a of the      engine 15. </PAR><PAR>  Output signals from the pressure sensors 18 and 19 and the rotation sensor      20 are fed to the swash plate controlling section 9, respectively. </PAR><PAR>  Now, it is assumed that absorptive horse powers derived from the hydraulic      pumps 12 and 13 are designated by HP.sub.1 and HP.sub.2. The absorptive      horse powers HP.sub.1 and HP.sub.2 are represented by the following      equations.      ##EQU1##      where </PAR><PAR>  K.sub.1 and K.sub.2 :constant </PAR><PAR>  N:the number of revolutions of the engine 15 </PAR><PAR>  V.sub.1 :capacity of hydraulic oil discharged from the hydraulic pump 12      (cc/rev) </PAR><PAR>  V.sub.2 :capacity of hydraulic oil discharged from the hydraulic pump 13      (cc/rev) </PAR><PAR>  P.sub.1 :pressure of hydraulic oil discharged from the hydraulic pump 12      (kg/cm.sup.2) </PAR><PAR>  P.sub.2 :pressure of hydraulic oil discharged from the hydraulic pump 13      (kg/cm.sup.2) </PAR><PAR>  Q.sub.1 :quantity of hydraulic oil discharged from the hydraulic pump 12      (cc/min) </PAR><PAR>  Q.sub.2 :quantity of hydraulic oil discharged from the hydraulic pump 13      (cc/min) </PAR><PAR>  In a case where the absorptive horse power HP.sub.1 derived from the      hydraulic pump 12 is to be maintained at a level of a half of the rated      horse power HP derived from the engine 15 as well as preset horse power      HP/2' lower than HP/2, it suffices that the capacity V.sub.1 of hydraulic      oil discharged from the hydraulic pump 12 is controlled such that the      quantity Q.sub.1 of hydraulic oil discharged from the hydraulic pump 12      and the pressure P.sub.1 of hydraulic oil discharged from the hydraulic      pump 12 are determined in accordance with the relationship as represented      by hyperbolic curves A and B in FIG. 3. </PAR><PAR>  Similarly, in a case where the absorptive horse power HP.sub.2 derived from      the hydraulic pump 13 is to be maintained at a level of HP/2 as well as a      level of HP/2' lower than HP/2, it suffices that the capacity V.sub.2 of      hydraulic oil discharged from the hydraulic pump 13 is controlled such      that the quantity Q.sub.2 of hydraulic oil discharged from the hydraulic      pump 13 and the pressure P.sub.2 of hydraulic oil discharged from the      hydraulic pump 13 are determined in accordance with the relationship as      represented by hyperbolic lines A and B in FIG. 4. </PAR><PAR>  HP/2 and HP/2' as noted above are hereinafter referred to as a reference      absorptive horse power, respectively. </PAR><PAR>  It should be noted that the rated horse power HP refers to a maximum horse      power which can be taken from the engine 14 in the fully throttled state. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a block diagram which schematically illustrates by way of example      the structure of the controlling section 9. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in the drawing, the controlling section 9 includes a discharge      capacity calculating portion 91-1 to which an output signal from the      pressure sensor 18, an output signal from the rotation sensor 20, a set      signal from a operation mode setter 21 and a signal indicative of an extra      horse power .DELTA.HP.sub.2 to be described later are fed. In addition,      the controlling section 9 includes a discharge capacity calculating      portion 91-2 to which an output signal from the pressure sensor 19, an      output signal from the rotation sensor 20, a set signal from an operation      mode setter 21 and a signal indicative of an extra horse power      .DELTA.HP.sub.1 to be described later are fed. </PAR><PAR>  The operational mode setter 21 is a manual actuating switch adapted to      selectively indicate a heavy operation mode H and a light operation mode      S. When the heavy operation mode H is selectively set, a signal indicative      of the reference absorptive horse power HP/2 is outputted from the      operation mode setter 21. On the contrary, when the light operation mode S      is selectively set, a signal indicative of the reference absorptive horse      power HP/2' is outputted from the operation mode setter 21. </PAR><PAR>  When the heavy operation mode H is selectively set, the discharge capacity      calculating portion 91-1 calculates an allowable target discharge capacity      V.sub.1P for allowing the absorptive horse power derived from the      hydraulic pump 12 to be raised up to a level of (HP/2)andplus;.DELTA.HP.sub.2 in      accordance with the following equation (3). </PAR><PAR>  Additionally, when the light operation mode S is selectively set, the      discharge capacity calculating portion 91-1 executes a calculation for      replacing HP/2 in the equation (3) with HP/2' and then obtains the      allowable target discharge volume V.sub.1P for allowing the absorptive      horse power derived from the hydraulic pump 12 to be raised up to a level      of (HP/2')andplus;.DELTA.HP.sub.2. </PAR><PAR>  Further, even in a case where the operation mode is set to either of H and      S, the discharge capacity calculating portion 91-1 calculates a reference      target discharge capacity V.sub.1R for allowing the absorptive horse power      derived from the hydraulic pump 12 to be set to the reference absorptive      horse power HP/2 in accordance with the following equation (4). </PAR><EQU>  V.sub.1P andequals;{(HP/2)andplus;.DELTA.HP.sub.2 }/K.sub.1 .multidot.N.multidot.P.sub.1(3) </EQU><EQU>  V.sub.1R andequals;(HP/2)/K.sub.1 .multidot.N.multidot.P.sub.1      (4) </EQU><PAR>  On the other hand, the discharge capacity calculating portion 91-2 executes      a calculation in accordance with the following equation (5) and a      calculation for replacing HP/2 in the equation (5) with HP/2' and then      obtains an allowable target discharge capacity V.sub.2P corresponding to      the allowable target discharge capacity V.sub.1P, when the heavy operation      mode H is selectively set. Further, the discharge capacity calculating      portion 91-2 executes a calculation in accordance with the equation (6)      and then obtains a reference target discharge capacity V.sub.2R      corresponding to the allowable target discharge capacity V.sub.1R, when      the light operation mode S is selectively set. </PAR><EQU>  V.sub.2P andequals;{(HP/2)andplus;.DELTA.HP.sub.1 }/K.sub.2 .multidot.N.multidot.P.sub.2(5) </EQU><EQU>  V.sub.2R andequals;(HP/2)/K.sub.2 .multidot.N.multidot.P.sub.2      (6) </EQU><PAR>  The controlling section 9 further includes a minimum discharge capacity      selecting portion 92-1 which compares a signal indicative of a target      discharge capacity V.sub.1L outputted from the command signal forming      section 5 with a signal indicative of the allowable target discharge      capacity V.sub.1P which has been calculated in the discharge capacity      calculating portion 91-1 and then selects and outputs a smaller signal of      the foregoing two signals therefrom. Thereafter, the output signal from      the minimum discharge capacity selecting portion 92-1 is fed to the      servo-actuator 16 shown in FIG. 1 as a swash plate angle commanding signal      for allowing the capacity V.sub.1 of hydraulic oil discharged from the      hydraulic pump 12 to be changed to the target discharge capacity V.sub.1L      or V.sub.1P. </PAR><PAR>  The controlling section further includes a minimum discharge capacity      selecting portion 92-2 which likewise compares a signal indicative of a      target discharge volume V.sub.2L outputted from the command signal forming      portion 6 with a signal indicative of the allowable target discharge      capacity V.sub.2P which has been calculated in the discharge capacity      calculating portion 91-2 and then selects and outputs a smaller signal of      the foregoing two signals. Thereafter, the output signal from the minimum      discharge capacity selecting portion 92-2 is fed to the servo-actuator 17      shown in FIG. 1 as a swash plate commanding signal for allowing the      capacity V.sub.2 of hydraulic oil discharged from the hydraulic pump 13 to      be changed to V.sub.2L or V.sub.2P. </PAR><PAR>  The controlling section 9 further includes an extra determining portion      93-1 which compares a signal indicative of the target discharge capacity      V.sub.1L with a signal indicative of the reference target discharge      capacity V.sub.1R which has been calculated in the discharge capacity      calculating portion 91-1. When it has been found from the result derived      from the foregoing comparison that the target discharge capacity V.sub.1L      is smaller than the reference target discharge capacity V.sub.1R, the      extra determining portion 93-1 outputs an extra indicating signal. </PAR><PAR>  Now, it is assumed that the hydraulic pump 12 discharges pressurized      hydraulic oil with the reference target discharge capacity V.sub.1R. As is      apparent from the equation (4), the absorptive horse power derived from      the hydraulic pump 12 coincides with the reference absorptive horse power      HP/2. In other words, the hydraulic pump 12 is driven in such an operative      state that it absorbs all the output horse power HP/2 of the engine 15 in      the divided state, i.e., in the operative state which satisfactorily meets      the equi-horse power line A shown in FIG. 3. </PAR><PAR>  Therefore, the fact that the relationship between the target discharge      capacity V.sub.1L and the reference target discharge capacity V.sub.1R is      such that the former is smaller than the latter represents that the      absorptive horse power derived from the hydraulic pump 12 becomes smaller      than the reference absorptive horse power HP/2 when the capacity of      hydraulic oil discharged from the hydraulic pump 12 is set to the target      discharge capacity V.sub.1L, i.e., that a part of the output horse power      HP/2 of the engine 15 in the divided state is not practically used. </PAR><PAR>  In such a case as mentioned above, the extra determining portion 93-1      outputs a signal indicative of the presence of an extra of the engine      output to an extra horse power calculating portion 94-1. </PAR><PAR>  The extra horse power calculating portion 94-1 includes an absorptive horse      power calculator 94-1A and a subtracter 94-1B. When the extra indicating      signal is inputted into the extra horse power calculating portion 94-1,      the absorptive horse power calculator 94-1A calculates the extra horse      power .DELTA.HP.sub.1 shown in the equation (5) in response to the extra      indicating signal transmitted from the extra determining section 93-1. </PAR><PAR>  Specifically, the absorptive horse power calculator 94-1A calculates an      actual absorptive horse power HP.sub.01 at the time of the target      discharge capacity V.sub.1L with reference to the target discharge      capacity V.sub.1L, the engine revolution number N and the pressure P.sub.1      of hydraulic oil discharged from the hydraulic pump 12. </PAR><PAR>  It should be noted that the absorptive horse power calculator 94-1A      executes the foregoing calculation while the target discharge capacity      V.sub.1L is substituted for the capacity V.sub.1 of hydraulic oil      discharged from the hydraulic pump 12 shown in the equation (1). </PAR><PAR>  On the other hand, the subtracter 33-1B executes a calculation for      subtracting the actual absorptive horse power HP.sub.01 from the reference      absorptive horse power HP/2 and then obtains the extra horse power      .DELTA.HP.sub.1 based on the results derived from this calculation. </PAR><PAR>  The signal indicative of the extra horse power .DELTA.HP.sub.1 outputted      from the extra horse power calculating portion 94-1 is fed to the      discharge capacity calculating portion 91-2 which is arranged for the      hydraulic pump 13. </PAR><PAR>  An extra determining portion 93-2 and an extra horse power calculating      portion 94-2 are substantially same to the extra horse power determining      portion 93-1 and the extra horse calculating portion 94-1 in structure and      function. Therefore, repeated description will not be required. It should      be added that an output signal indicative of the extra power force      .DELTA.HP.sub.2 outputted from the extra horse power calculating portion      94-2 is fed to the discharge capacity calculating portion 91-1 which is      arranged for the hydraulic pump 12. </PAR><PAR>  According to the embodiment of the present invention, in a case where a      signal indicative of the target discharge capacity V.sub.1P is outputted      from the minimum discharge capacity selecting portion 92-1 and a signal      indicative of the extra horse power .DELTA.HP.sub.2 is fed to the      discharge capacity calculating portion 91-1, the hydraulic pump 12 absorbs      a horse power corresponding to a line C shown in FIG. 3. Incidentally, in      a case where the position along the line C varies corresponding to      variation of the extra horse power .DELTA.HP.sub.2 and the extra horse      power .DELTA.HP.sub.2 is reduced to a level of zero, the line C overlaps      the line A. In this case, the absorptive force power derived from the      hydraulic pump 12 is changed to HP/2 and the absorptive horse power      derived from the other hydraulic pump 13 is likewise changed to HP/2. </PAR><PAR>  On the other hand, in a case where a signal indicative of the target      discharge capacity V.sub.1L is outputted from the minimum discharge      capacity selecting portion 92-1, the absorptive horse power derived from      the hydraulic pump 12 is reduced lower than HP/2 or      (HP/2)andplus;.DELTA.HP.sub.1. When it has been found that the absorptive horse      power derived from the hydraulic pump 12 is reduced lower than HP/2, a      signal indicative of the extra horse power .DELTA.HP.sub.1 is fed to the      discharge capacity calculating portion 91-2. </PAR><PAR>  As is apparent from the above description, according to the embodiment of      the present invention, the swash plate angle of each of the hydraulic      pumps 12 and 13, i.e., the discharge capacity of each of the hydraulic      pumps 12 and 13 is controlled such that a sum of the absorptive horse      power derived from the hydraulic pump 12 and the absorptive horse power      derived from the hydraulic pump 13 is normally smaller than the rated      horse power of the engine 15. In a case where one of the hydraulic pumps      12 and 13 receives a small magnitude of load, the allowable absorptive      horse power derived from the other hydraulic pump can automatically be      enlarged by a quantity corresponding to the extra horse power, whereby the      rated horse power of the engine 15 can be utilized effectively. </PAR><PAR>  According to the embodiment of the present invention, the hydraulic      actuators 10 and 11 are arranged corresponding to the hydraulic pumps 12      and 13. Alternatively, a plurality of hydraulic actuators 10-1 to 10-N and      11-1 to 11-M may be arranged corresponding to the hydraulic pumps 12 and      13, as shown in FIG. 5. In this case, as is apparent from the drawing, a      plurality of actuating valves 7-1 to 7-N and 8-1 to 8-M are arranged      corresponding to the hydraulic actuators 10-1 to 10-N and 11-1 to 11M and      moreover a plurality of command signal forming sections 5-1 to 5-N and 6-1      to 6-M are arranged corresponding to the actuating valves 7-1 to 7-N and      8-1 to 8-M. </PAR><PAR>  In this case, a signal resulting from totalization of output signals from      the respective signal forming sections 5-1 to 5-N is used as a signal      representative of the target discharge capacity V.sub.1L shown in FIG. 2,      while a signal resulting from totalization of output signals from the      respective signal forming sections 6-1 to 6-M is used as a signal      representative of the target discharge capacity V.sub.2L in the drawing. </PAR><PAR>  Further, according to the embodiment of the present invention, a half of      the rated horse power HP of the engine 15 is equally distributed to each      of the hydraulic pumps 12 and 13 as an allowable absorptive horse power.      For example, in a case where it is previously informed on the basis of a      given specification for the construction machine that a load to be born by      the hydraulic pump 12 is smaller than a load to be born by the hydraulic      pump 13, a rate of the allowable absorptive horse power to be distributed      to the hydraulic pump 12 may be set higher than a rate of the allowable      absorptive horse power to be distributed to the hydraulic pump 13. </PAR><PAC>  INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </PAC><PAR>  As is readily apparent from the above description, the apparatus for      controlling hydraulic pumps for a construction machine in accordance with      the present invention is advantageously employable for properly      controlling the absorptive horse power derived from each hydraulic pump.      Especially, the apparatus is preferably employable for a construction      machine for performing an excavating operation wherein a load to be born      by each hydraulic pump varies largely. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
