Approaches taken to achieve a goal of online implementationinclude: decomposition of the original system into smaller subsystemsthat are handled independently, development of a rule-based disturbanceidentification process embedded in a tracking state estimator for eachsubsystem used to identify the occurrence of a disturbance, and the developmentof key indicators (based upon a bifurcation theoretic approach to steady-statestability analysis) for assessing the effects of the disturbance. Algorithmperformance and execution time are demonstrated using operating dataobtained from the REMVEC 345 kV network. 16 refs., 14 figs., 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
