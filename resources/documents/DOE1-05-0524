All subjects have been diagnosedduring the last 16 months at the National Kagawa Children's Hospitalwith conventional methods and then referred to MRI study at the ShinsumaHospital, where a MRI system of a regular-conducting magnet operatingat a field strength of 1.5 KG (Picker International Corp., U.S.A.) hasbeen installed. Using the two-dimensional Fourier transform technique,three radiofrequency pulse sequences; inversion recovery: IR 2100/500,and spin-echo: SE 2100/40 or 2100/80, were routinely applied. Comparedwith X-ray CT, MR proved to be advantageous in the more precise detectionof the pathoanatomical relation and in providing information about themyelinating process. The analysis of the myelinating process by MRI insuch cerebral dysgeneses as lissencephaly, frontal-lobe dysgenesis, agenesisof the corpus callosum, and microcephalic hydrocephalus was very importantfor the detection of further functional cerebral developments. The pathoanatomicalanalysis by MRI, in particular with the midline sagittal view, is extremelyadvantageous in the diagnosis of Chiari malformation, holoprosencephaly,the Dandy-Walker syndrome, congenital dermal sinus, syringobulbia, andothers. The disadvantages or weak points of MRI were also identifiedin this study. The CSF dynamics in both the major and minor fluid pathwaysas analyzed by metrizamide CT cisternography or ventriculography is muchsuperior to the information revealed by MRI, although the SE techniquecan demonstrate some fluid distribution in the brain parenchyma and adifferent signal intensity in the fluid movements. The information aboutthe bony structure in dysraphic states and calcifications in associatedanomalies was also poor. (J.P.N.).</TEXT></DOC>
