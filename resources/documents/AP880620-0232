The police say a flourishing crocodile hide-for-cocaine tradeexists in the Pantanal, but they have yet to catch anyone.   In Corumba alone, 660 pounds of cocaine were seized last year.On the other side of the river, in Puerto Suarez, Bolivia, whichhas 1,200 people and 490 taxis, stuffed caimans are displayed insouvenir shops. Corumba is believed to be a main gateway forBolivian cocaine.   In Pocone, a tiny Pantanal town 75 miles from Cuiaba, theenvironmental threat stems from an uncontrolled gold rush. Taxidrivers quote prices in gold instead of in Brazil's weak cruzadocurrency. Practically every other store buys and sells gold.   But in the environs, the mercury used in the primitiveextraction of gold has left its mark: hollow trees decaying likeskeletons.   ``People want gold, and they don't care how they take it out,''said Catia Nunes da Cunha, coordinator of Mato Grosso'senvironmental agency.   In 1987, tens of thousands of rough, free-lance prospectors usedmercury to extract an estimated 50 tons of Brazilian gold, much ofit from the northern Pantanal. Much of that reportedly was smuggledout of Brazil and never appeared on official registers, accordingto the environmental agency.   About 60 percent of the mercury in the gold processing remainsas an environment-polluting residue, Ms. da Cunha said. Mercurypoisons wildlife and people. Gold prospectors themselves areaffected by it when they eat Pantanal fish and game, often windingup with nervous disorders and transmitting birth defects to theiroffspring.   Brazil's environmental laws severely restrict the use ofmercury, but in the remote Pantanal the laws are widely ignored.   The evironmental situation in the wetlands would be worse wereit not for the ``Pantaneiros,'' as the wetlands' natives are calledin Brazil's Portuguese language. They mostly are ``swamp cowboys''working for local ranches who take it upon themselves to try tocounter the poachers and gold miners.   These unofficial law enforcers and conservationists, oftenpiloting river canoes, try to care for endangered crocodiles,jaguars, river otters, wild swamp deer, giant anteaters andcapybaras, the world's largest rodents, which look like pig-sizedrabbits but without ears.   The Pantaneiros also help protect macaws, sapphire-coloredtropical parrots with yellow-ringed eyes, which often fetch $10,000apiece overseas and which by law can't be killed or exported fromBrazil. The Pantaneiros say poachers trap macaws and other membersof the parrot family by brushing glue on trees where the birdsperch.   Douglas Trent, an American tourist agent now living in Brazil,says ``rational, sustainable'' tourism can help save the Pantanalby increasing international awareness of the region.   ``But it must be done with caution,'' he said. ``Tourism alsocan destroy. Caimans eat plastic film cannisters but don't digestthem. Birds choke on candy wrappers and get their feet caught infishing lines.''   Arne Sucksdorf, an award-winning filmmaker who left his nativeSweden two decades ago to live in and document the Pantanal, said,``The Pantanal is a legend, but it is being killed.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 26</NOTE></DOC>
