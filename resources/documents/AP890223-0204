Thornburgh got involved in the case of Joe Doherty _ who has beenin federal prison in Manhattan since FBI agents arrested him June28, 1983 _ at the request of the Immigration and NaturalizationService, which wants him deported, said Dave Runkel, a spokesman forthe attorney general.   ``He was asked to by the INS, and he decided to take a look atit,'' Runkel said.   At issue is a Board of Immigration Appeals decision last Nov. 14that Doherty could reopen his request for asylum in the UnitedStates and remanding that request to an INS judge.   Had Thornburgh stayed out of it, Doherty could have pursued hissearch for asylum with the judge, Justice Department spokesman LoyeMiller said.   Doherty, who was convicted with three others of the killing thatoccurred during a gunfight between British soldiers and IRA memberswho had planned to ambush a British Army patrol in 1980, broke outof a maximum security prison in Northern Ireland more than six yearsago.   He contends he is not a terrorist or a murderer, but a soldierengaged in war, and he is seeking asylum on the grounds that hewould be subject to persecution if he were sent to Britain.   Stephen A. Somerstein, one of Doherty's New York-based attorneys,criticized Thornburgh's involvement.   ``We had requested that the attorney general not review it (theBoard of Immigration Appeals' decision) and just allow us our day incourt to press our political asylum claim that the board said weshould have,'' Somerstein said in a telephone interview.   ``We've felt all along that it was improper for the attorneygeneral to be reviewing decisions of his own board of immigrationappeals,'' he said. ``It's tantamount to his being a judge in hisown case.''   Thornburgh's decision means ``just more delay,'' he said. ``Thedelay already has been interminable, and he's been incarcerated allthrough this. The length of his incarceration exceeds all bounds offairness, of reasonableness.''   Doherty's case has involved the attentions of the White House,the Justice Department, civil rights activities and the leaders ofGreat Britain and Ireland.   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher raised the case in talkswith President Reagan during a 1986 visit to Washington.   Doherty's supporters include New York's Roman Catholic ArchbishopCardinal John O'Connor, Amnesty International, the American CivilLiberties Union and Jesse Jackson, who visited Doherty last July.   In the latest twist in the case, which has wended its way throughfederal courts and immigration hearings over the past five years,Thornburgh ordered that the INS submit by March 27 a brief insupport of its position.   After that, Doherty will have 30 days to submit a brief arguinghis case, and then the INS will have 14 days to file a reply.   In 1983, the British government filed a formal request forDoherty's extradition. It was denied in December 1984 by U.S.District Judge John E. Sprizzo in Brooklyn, who ruled that Doherty'scrime was a political act and qualified the defendant for politicalasylum.   The government appealed and U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haightdecided in Doherty's favor. A government appeal to the U.S. Court ofAppeals in New York upheld Doherty's previous victories.   Then the Justice Department began deportation proceedings.   Since the law says deportees can choose where they are sent,Doherty chose the independent Republic of Ireland and his decisionwas upheld in 1986 by immigration Judge Howard I. Cohen in 1986.   Then the INS appealed Cohen's order and lost again. Thegovernment appealed twice more, and lost twice again, the mostrecent loss coming last Nov. 14.   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III, meanwhile, ``issued anopinion that it was not in the interest of the United States'foreign policy that he be allowed to go to Ireland, that he shouldbe deported to Britain,'' Miller said.   The option of being deported to Ireland was eliminated for goodwhen Ireland, under pressure from London and Washington, in December1987 ratified the European Convention on Terrorism, which calls formandatory extradition of those deemed terrorists.   ``Doherty at that point asked the Board of Immigration Appeals torevoke his concession that he was deportable, claiming grounds ofchanged circumstances and the likelihood he would be subject topersecution,'' Miller said. ``That's gounds for asking for asylum.''   When the BIA ruled 3-2 last November, ``The three said that theythought there was a well-founded possibility that his fear ofpersecution was valid and should be considered again,'' Miller said.</TEXT></DOC>
