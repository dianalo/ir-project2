The FDIC voted to require state-chartered banks that aren't in the Federal Reserve system to release, on request, the same kind of data they report to federal regulators. The other federal bank regulators, which try to develop consistent regulations, are expected soon to implement similar rules.    FDIC approval came despite opposition from the American Bankers Association, which said that the rule will be burdensome to some small banks and provide consumers with information that is easily misunderstood.    But the FDIC staff contends the rule will &quot;improve public awareness and understanding of the financial condition&quot; of banks, and reduce the likelihood of people &quot;overreacting to incomplete information.&quot;    The Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates all federally chartered banks, proposed a similar rule on June 22. A final version is said to be complete, but must be reviewed by the Treasury and the White House budget office. The staff of the Federal Reserve, which regulates bank holding companies, is preparing a parallel disclosure proposal for consideration by the Fed's governors, according to the FDIC.    The FDIC rule calls for banks to make public the &quot;call reports&quot; they send to regulators, which contain detailed financial data, or audited financial statements or other reports providing comparable information. The rule requires that they post notices in all branches and have statements available by March 31, or five days after the bank mails its annual report to shareholders, whichever is sooner.    Also yesterday, the FDIC board deferred a deadline for U.S. branches of foreign banks to limit their lending outside the U.S.    The rule is designed to limit the risk that the branches would be unable to recover capital from a country because of currency exchange controls or other restrictions. It would cap lending to the bank's home country at double the branch's required capital, currently 6% of assets, and to other countries at the equivalent of the branch's capital.    The FDIC board deferred the deadline to May of next year from Jan. 22, and some board members hinted they want to change it. Chairman William Seidman suggested the issue be reviewed by the Interagency Country Exposure Review Committee, which evaluates creditworthiness of foreign nations. Scott Annenberg, a lawyer for the Institute of International Bankers, said this may suggest Mr. Seidman would favor varying lending limits to different countries depending on their creditworthiness.    The institute, the leading trade group for foreign banks in the U.S., contended that attempting to cap lending by U.S. branches can give a distorted picture of the parent bank's riskiness. Mr. Annenberg said the FDIC should leave such supervision to the banks' home-country regulators, who can review risks of the whole bank.    In voting to postpone the rule, the FDIC board ignored pleas from Paul Frits, director of the FDIC's division of bank supervision. He said foreign banks have been on notice about the requirement for three years, have not conformed to it and have failed to convince the staff it should be relaxed. He said the staff would prefer a much lower limit on foreign lending of about 50% of the branch's required capital. </TEXT></DOC>
