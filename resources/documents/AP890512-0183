U.S. District Court Judge Raymond L. Acosta said he was``generally satisfied'' with the out-of-court settlement in one ofthe largest disaster litigations in American history.   He said the agreement was binding on all parties but contingenton unspecified conditions being met within 60 days. The judge saidthe first of three phases of the complex trial will remain ineffect until July 14.   In the meantime he issued a 60-day stay against all claimsagainst the defendants.   Agreement in the case, involving about 2,300 plaintiffs seekingdamages from 230 defendants, was reached Tuesday and approvedThursday night by District Judge Louis C. Bechtle in Philadelphia.   The defendants, who filed 264 separate lawsuits, had sought $1.8billion.   U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist had appointedBechtle to head the negotiations. Bechtle was the presiding judgein a similar case involving the 1980 MGM Grand Hotel fire in LasVegas that killed 84 people. The settlement in that case totaled$200 million.   Under the agreement signed in Philadelphia, $50 million will bepaid by the insurer, American International Underwriters Corp., and$35 million by the Dupont-family group of partnerships andindividuals who owned many hotel enterprises, including the DupontPlaza. Other insurance carriers will pay the remaining $15 million.   In an interview after Friday's hearing, Acosta said the 300-pageagreement calls for the plaintiffs to receive $85 million in whathe described as ``hard money'' and $15 million in ``soft money.''   He said hard money meant immediately available funds such ascash, bonds and property. Soft money refers to funds the defendantssaid they could raise but could not guarantee.   The plaintiffs agreed to accept any portion of the $15 millionthe defendants could raise.   The judge said he could not reveal the ``critical conditions''to be completed over the next 60 days.   Jorge Ortiz Brunet, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said theygenerally dealt with deadlines for the defendants to pay theirshare of the settlement.   The fire on Dec. 31, 1986, killed 97 people and injured morethan 140. It broke out in a ballroom on the first floor of the22-floor hotel, and most of the victims were trapped in the casino.The beach hotel was filled on New Year's Eve with nearly 1,000guests.   The disaster occurred during bitter labor negotiations betweenthe Teamsters Union and the hotel management. Three formeremployees who were members of the union were accused of setting thefire and were convicted in 1987 of murder. The union denied anyresponsibility.   The hotel was cited for 25 violations by the Occupational Safetyand Health Administration, including lack of emergency exits fromthe casino where 84 of the victims periushed.   In the first phase of the trial, which began March 15, lawyersfor the plaintiffs claimed that Dupont's parent company, HotelSystems International, sought a coverup to avoid liability.   The second phase of the trial deals with hotel suppliers, andAcosta said those proceedings would begin in 45 days regardless ofwhether conditions he set down for ending the first phase weresatisfied.   The final phase deals with a lawsuit filed by the hotel againstthe Puerto Rican chapter of the Teamsters Union.   The 425-room hotel in San Juan's Condado district has beenrenovated but has not reopened.</TEXT></DOC>
