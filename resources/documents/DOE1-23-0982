General theorems are given which providea mathematically explicit in-principle limit to the mechanical efficiencyof kinematic heat engines in terms of a small number of basic engineparameters. Just as the Carnot efficiency is an upper bound to the thermalperformance of all heat engines, this paper describes an analogous limiton the mechanical performance of kinematic heat engines and relates thetheoretical results to practical engine design and operation.</TEXT></DOC>
