Steelworkers in nine states approved the settlement 19,621 to 4,045. Union officials tallied the rank-and-file ballots on Saturday, the dispute's 184th day. USX was the last of the nation's major steelmakers to reach a labor agreement with the union.    Ratification had been widely expected since the presidents of union locals approved the contract Jan. 18 by a 38-to-4 vote. The biggest surprise in the balloting was the margin of approval. For instance, Local 1014 at the steelmaker's Gary, Ind., works -- the union's largest local -- approved the pact 2,690 to 717, or nearly a 4-to-1 margin.    Ratification enables the nation's largest steelmaker to resume production at some mills this month. It also enables the company to proceed with a revamping of its steel operations; this includes shuttering parts of some mills.    USX has declined to disclose its plans, fearing that talk of restructuring its steel operations could hinder ratification. Nonetheless, the steelmaker is expected to restart at first only its flat-rolled steelmaking facilities, which provide steel to auto and appliance makers, the steel industry's strongest markets. These mills include the Gary works, the linchpin of the company's steelmaking. </TEXT></DOC>
