(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The cartoonist who created Hustlermagazine's ``Chester the Molester'' has been convicted of molestinga teen-age girl.   Dwaine Tinsley, 44, was found guilty of five child molestationcounts by a Superior Court jury on Friday. Jurors agreed Tinsleyhad substantial sexual contact with the girl but also acquitted himof six charges and deadlocked on another five.   The cartoon created by Tinsley depicts a lecherous character andhis attraction to young girls. He refused to talk with reportersafter the verdict.   Defense lawyer George C. Eskin promised to appeal the guiltyverdicts, arguing as he did during trial that the young womanaccused Tinsley in retaliation for his efforts to halt her drug use.   Tinsley faces a maximum prison term of 16 years and a $50,000fine when he is sentenced March 1, said Deputy District AttorneyMatthew J. Hardy.   The molestations started in 1984, when the girl was 13 andcontinued until age 17, he said.   Evidence presented at the trial said Tinsley told co-workers,``You can't write this stuff all the time if you don't experienceit.''   But Tinsley's ``Chester the Molester'' eliminated its focus onpedophilia several years ago, Hardy said.   The prosecutor said the verdicts vindicated the victim, whoselongtime efforts to report the attacks were discredited by adults.   Tinsley, who now lives in Los Angeles, testified during theseven-day trial that the woman made up the story because hedisapproved of her cocaine habit.</TEXT></DOC>
