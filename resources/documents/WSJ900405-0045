Such cost-cutting ideas, aimed at the military'stime-honored way of choosing and training its future leaders,emerged yesterday during a Senate Armed Services subcommitteehearing. Once considered to be almost heretical and politicalfolly by Pentagon supporters, the proposals circulating onCapitol Hill show how far the debate over defense spendinghas shifted in recent months.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We know that current demand for new officers is less thanwas forecast four or five years ago,&quot; said subcommitteechairman Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio), adding that heftiertroop cuts are inevitable by the mid-1990s. Budget pressuresrequire the Pentagon to &quot;improve the efficiency as well asthe academic vitality of the academies,&quot; Sen. Glenn said,noting that Congress has an obligation to carefully reviewhow the institutions manage those changes.   Budget cuts involving the academies are still preliminary,and the details won't become clear until the Pentagoncompletes its own personnel review later this year. Butmembers of the subcommittee, conducting their first detailedoversight hearing on the subject in more than a decade,grilled the superintendent of each of the service academiesabout everything from maintenance and training costs tofaculty-student ratios.   &quot;We're going to have to do something about {newlycommissioned} officers coming through the system as thoughnothing has changed&quot; in East-West relations, said Sen. JamesExon (D., Neb.), usually a strong supporter of the Pentagon.   So far, the military has avoided committing itself tomajor changes. &quot;There are no sacred cows&quot; in the effort tocut costs, Christopher Jehn, the Pentagon's top personnelofficial, assured lawmakers.   But other witnesses acknowledged that current Pentagonplans envision that the size of the class entering each ofthe three service academies -- West Point, Annapolis and theAir Force Academy in Colorado Springs -- will remainbasically flat this fall. As a result, the largest and mostimmediate cuts in new officers are expected to come from the850 or so colleges and universities that offerofficer-training programs.   Whatever the outcome, lawmakers are certain to think hardabout making changes in programs that for decades have beenamong the most popular and jealously guarded portions of thedefense budget. Sen. Glenn, who clearly used the hearing tosend an early-warning signal to the military bureaucracy,nevertheless assured the witnesses that his goal was toimpose tighter financial controls on the academies rather&quot;than to close them down or to reduce their role as thebedrock source of military officers.&quot;   Increased congressional scrutiny, however, already hasembarrassed the academies. A General Accounting Office reportreleased by the subcommittee concluded that the Pentagon mayhave tried to hide millions of dollars paid to run thefacilities, while failing to adequately audit and supervisetheir financial affairs.</TEXT></DOC>
