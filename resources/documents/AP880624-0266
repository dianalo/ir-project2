The impact was measured not only in failing crops, but infrantic commodity trading, surging electric power demand,restrictions on lawn-watering and car-washing in dozens of townsand shipping backed up on the no longer mighty Mississippi. Theriver was 20 feet below its year-ago levels at Memphis, Tenn.,where more than a thousand barges were stranded.   In some respects, it was already a lost summer. Rain could stillsave some crops, said Kansas Agriculture Secretary Sam Brownback,but ``the pastures are so short they're never going to get ahead ofthe herd _ they're past their growing.''   However, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said Thursday thathard, steady rains in the next two weeks could still prevent majordamage and that it was still too early to commit federal money todrought relief.   In the past week, the drought was measured in many ways:   _ The U.S. Department of Agriculture listed 1,231 counties, 40percent of the total, as having a drought emergency.   _ The U.S. Geological Survey reported that the number of streamswith normal flow in May was the lowest in six years, with only 54percent of 191 river measuring stations at normal or better.Streamflows in California were 42 percent below average in May. TheSaline River in Arkansas had only 10 percent of normal flow, whilethe Tombigbee River at Coatopa, Ala., was 15 percent of normal.   _ Sixty-one cities had record high temperatures on Tuesday, 64set records on Wednesday and 35 on Thursday.   _ Cows were selling for 39 cents a pound, down from 51-52 centstwo weeks ago, as farmers rushed to get rid of herds they could nolonger feed.   _ Tom George, administrator of Soil Conservation Service erosionsurveys, said wind erosion damaged 13.1 million parched acres inthe Great Plains this year, about three times the annual average.   _ Corn prices have doubled in a month, from $1.70-$1.85 in Mayto $3.48 at Thursday's close. Soybeans nudged close to $11 a bushelfor July delivery.   ``With the corn crop, each week that goes by without rain meansanother 10 percent is lost,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst withResearch Department Inc. in Chicago. Some estimate anywhere from 10percent to 30 percent of the U.S. corn crop already has been ruined.   While that was bad news for consumers, farmers with adequaterain and those with grain in storage stood to reap windfall profits.   ``I'm afraid we're going to lose some farmers, and we've lostenough already in my state,'' said Gov. George Sinner of NorthDakota, one of 10 Midwest governors who met with Lyng in Chicagolast week.   The bottom line for consumers, the Agriculture Department said,is a 1 percent increase in food prices if the drought persists.   Grain-based foods, such as bread and pasta, were likely toincrease the most, economists said, but drought was also likely toraise the price of beer. Barley, a prime ingredient in beer, hadincreased from $2.55-$2.60 a bushel to $4.30-$4.50 since June 6,said Marge Jones, owner and publisher of the Brewers Bulletin inWoodstock, Ill.   Low river levels also posed a pollution threat, because therewasn't enough water in many places to properly dilute sewage andother wastes.   Flows were barely adequate to handle discharges from pulp andpaper mills along the Fox and Wisconsin rivers, said Bruce Baker,director of water resource management for Wisconsin's Department ofNatural Resources.   ``Once a flow drops below risk level, waste from the plantsexceeds a river's capacity to assimilate it,'' Baker said. ``Atthat point, we must just sit back and watch the fish die.''   But it's not so easy to raise levels even where stored water isavailable. The Army Corps of Engineers found that discharging waterfrom the Gavins Point Dam on the South Dakota-Nebraska border mightwash awy the nests of piping plovers and interior least terns, bothfederally protected species.   ``I guess we've got conflicting interests here,'' said ChetWorm, chief of reservoir operations for the corps in Omaha, toldThe Kansas City Star. ``Sometimes you forget the river has allkinds of users, not just people.''   The dry heat raised concern about the dreaded ``greenhouseeffect,'' the theory that all the carbon dioxide pumped into theatmosphere by our cars, furnaces and factories, was warming theclimate.   ``Global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribewith a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationshipbetween the greenhouse effect and the observed warming,'' JamesHansen, a climatalogist at the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New YorkCity, told a congressional committee.   However, Hansen added, there was no way to prove the``greenhouse'' caused this heat wave.   Hot it was, but it wasn't miserable for everyone.   ``The weather's been really nice ident and wine maker for Glenora WineCellars nearDundee, N.Y.   Hot weather was great for business at Press Box East, anair-conditioned restaurant in Charlotte, N.C. ``People are stayinglonger,'' said general manager Bobbie Barley. ``Instead of havingjust a cold beer, they're staying for dinner.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 26</NOTE></DOC>
