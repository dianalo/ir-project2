Also on Monday, former classmates of fugitive student leaderWu'er Kaixi resumed classes at Beijing Normal University with oneweek of required political study, but students said they were justgoing through the motions.   Zhang Weiping, 25, was sentenced Saturday by the HangzhouIntermediate People's Court for spreading counter-revolutionarypropaganda and instigating criminal acts, according to China YouthNews.   Zhang, a senior at Zhejiang Fine Arts Institute in the easterncity of Hangzhou, admitted he called the U.S. government-fundedradio station and that he drew eight cartoons vilifying CommunistParty and government leaders, but he would not acknowledge his actswere counterrevolutionary, the daily said.   According to the court, on June 6, two days after the bloodymilitary crackdown of the student movement in Beijing, Zhang calledVOA and said students in Hangzhou had forced authorities to fly theChinese flag at half staff to mourn the dead in Beijing.   It said Zhang sent a tape of the VOA broadcast of his report tohis university to be played on the school's public address system,and ``it created a very bad political influence.''   VOA, which has a large audience in China, has been criticized inthe official media since the crackdown for ``rumor-mongering'' inits reports, and one of its correspondents was expelled. Chinese saythey still regard it as more reliable than their government-runmedia.   Authorities have arrested thousands of workers and students whotook part in the pro-democracy movement, and dozens of workers havebeen sentenced to long prison terms for rioting and causing socialdisturbances. At least 12 non-students have been executed fordestroying public property and attacking police.   Hundreds and perhaps thousands of people were killed in the June3-4 crackdown of the pro-democracy movement, which called for an endto official corruption, freedom of the press and a dialogue withgovernment leaders.   The government has announced the arrests of eight of the 21student leaders on a nationwide wanted list, but so far none hasbeen brought to public trial. Two students on the list _ Wu'er andLi Lu _ fled abroad, but Chinese sources say all of the remaining 19have been arrested.   Officials have refused to comment on such reports, including aHong Kong TV report over the weekend that the fourth student on thelist, Chai Ling, was arrested in Beijing.   College students are returning to their campuses, but theatmosphere is very different from the spring.   Students at Beijing Normal University, where Wu'er was a freshmanlast year, said they spent their first day of class Monday watchinggovernment videotapes of what is officially called a``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''   The tapes, which appeared on TV this summer, glorify thesoldiers, who are said to have exercised utmost patience andrestraint when faced with ``hooligans'' pitching stones and bottlesand setting tanks on fire.   ``We all know what really happened, though,'' said a sophomorefrom Jiangsu province as he walked to an afternoon politicaldiscussion session. He said he and his classmates would say whateverwas expected of them but made it clear no one believed any of it.   Although none of the students spoke of renewing the protests,they were keenly interested in the fate of the movement's leaders.   Many asked, ``What is Wu'er Kaixi doing now?'' and ``Where arethe other escaped leaders living?'' Wu'er has been accepted to studyat Harvard University, but many others appear not to have settledanywhere yet.   Many also asked about Chai Ling, one of only two women on themost-wanted list of 21 student leaders. She was at the forefront ofthe students' weeklong hunger strike in May, and reportedly was oneof the last to leave Tiananmen Square on the night of the armyattack.   Groups of students walking past the student canteen, which wasplastered with posters this spring, barely glanced at its brickwalls.   They also ignored a large red banner hung across the campus' mainroad exhorting students to ``continue the struggle against bourgeoisliberalism to the very end.''   The TV news Monday showed more than 10,000 students from 15schools in Shenyang, in northeastern China, hacking at overgrownweeds Sunday. The ``voluntary labor'' was organized by theprovincial government and is part of the renewed emphasis on moldinga correct proletarian attitude.   There are almost no students at Beijing University's campus, ahotbed of student activism this spring. The start of classes hasbeen delayed until Oct. 14, partly in an attempt to prevent anystudent protests on the Oct. 1 anniversary of 40 years of Communistrule in China.</TEXT></DOC>
