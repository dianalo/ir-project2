Still, a sustained second-quarter recovery in West German equity prices isn't yet in sight, analysts say.    The stock exchange posted its sixth consecutive gain Friday, after hitting an 18-month low the week before. The Commerzbank index climbed 40.9 points to 1779.4, its highest level since Feb. 2, when the index stood at 1782.5. The index gained 134.9, or 8.2%, in the course of the week.    Blue-chip issues were snapped up in buying spearheaded by Japanese institutional investors, who were also big consumers of German government bonds, brokers said.    Notably, the Japanese were joined by &quot;the whole foreign investment community&quot; including U.S. and British pension funds, said a broker at a large West German bank.    Managers of large British and U.S. pension funds, who triggered the bull market of the 1980s, were seen as instrumental in its dissipation this year because of their massive dumping of German shares, analysts say.    Until the recent turnaround, the blizzard of foreign selling -- along with anemic domestic buying -- had driven down shares 18% from their New Year's level. The three-month slide made German blue-chip stocks cheap relative to issues in New York, London and Tokyo.    That price difference, news of some positive corporate 1986 results and expectations of lower interest rates are fueling the current rally, brokers said.    The resurging foreign interest also lured domestic investors to return to the market last week, the broker said. &quot;The market mood is rapidly improving, and we seem to have gotten over the low,&quot; he said.    The likelihood for a prolonged upswing, though, isn't bolstered by the reduced expectations for West German economic growth, the perils for the nation's export-led industries offered by the falling dollar and technical charts indicating a long-term downward trend.    In light of the weak export performance and a stagnating economy in the past six months, most economists have lowered their forecasts for West German economic growth to less than 2% from 2.5%. Most estimates of company earnings for 1987 and 1988 have been cut, analysts say, and profits are likely to come in short of the the past two banner years.    Although the German stock market is fundamentally undervalued, analysts say, the most that can be hoped for are temporary technical rebounds and better-than-average performances of individual issues.    Small investors should pick specialized stocks with strong earnings potential and hope that the dollar won't fall much lower than its recent level around 1.82 marks, analysts say.    Medium-sized, consumer-oriented companies, such as hair care and cosmetics producer Wella and detergents and special chemicals-maker Henkel are still on the buy lists of analysts and brokerage houses, while large retailing groups such as Kaufhof, which advanced 5% Friday, are attractive again following sharp drops in their stock prices early in the year, analysts say.    A further decline in the dollar, though, is likely to lead to a pronounced reduction in the profits of the export-oriented sector, especially automobile and machinery makers, analysts say.    Even if the dollar stays above the psychologically important level of 1.80 marks, the German auto industry isn't likely to see a repeat of 1986's record sales and profits in the coming years, analysts say. In light of these prospects, the currency fraud scandal at Volkswagen is the least of the problems this sector faces, they say.    &quot;Auto stocks are right for traders,&quot; says Eckehardt Schubert, a senior analyst at Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, or West Lb. &quot;One can only make money with them through short-term transactions,&quot; Mr. Schubert adds.    Topping the Japanese shopping list Friday was Daimler-Benz, West Germany's largest industrial group and the maker of Mercedes cars and trucks. Bayerische Motorenwerke, or BMW, also advanced as did Volkswagen, which recovered its level of more than two weeks ago, when news of its currency-trading scandal broke.    The same short-term logic applies to financial stocks, Mr. Schubert says. Those stocks got a boost this week from market expectations of good earnings and higher dividends for 1986 in the nation's largest commercial banks -- Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank. All three stocks advanced Friday.    Narrow interest margins, though, and a shrinking security trading business aren't bullish for the sector, analysts say.    If the general market enters a technical-recovery phase, investors who bet on high-yield stocks in the chemical and utility sectors are likely to benefit most, says West Lb's Mr. Schubert.    In the chemical group, Bayer remains a favorite with analysts because of its consumer-oriented product mix.    &quot;We expect Bayer to outperform its sector and the rest of the market,&quot; says Michael Willis-Fleming, an analyst at Savory Milln, a London-based brokerage house.    Another bright spot is the energy and chemicals concern Veba. The German government sold its 25% stake in Veba for the equivalent of $1.39 billion last week, and analysts were surprised at how well the placement of 10.1 million shares for more than $137 each was received by investors. Given the company's solid 1986 performance and strong earnings prospects, analysts don't expect the newly placed shares to be thrown back into the market any time soon.    The successful placement of the Veba package might terminate a major irritant of the market -- the glut of new issues and large stock placements. The sale of construction group Hochtief's shares by the Finck family, the sell-off of Iran's stake Deutsche Babcock and a rights issue by the machinery maker, the expected capital increase at insurance group Aachener andamp; Muenchener Beteiligungs and the Veba transaction have recently thrown more than $2.75 billion in additional equity into the German market.    &quot;This has been a major burden in the past few months,&quot; says Mr. Fischer of Bank in Liechtenstein. But, with the government likely to postpone the sale of its 16% Volkswagen stake because of the currency scandal at the auto maker, the rush of new issues seems to have come at least to a temporary halt, analysts say.    ---   Tokyo, London Activity   Tokyo share prices closed at record levels at the end of the half-day Saturday session after scoring huge gains on unprecedented volume Friday.    Saturday, the Nikkei stock average advanced 151.36 points to 22,178.02, surpassing the record Friday, when the average surged 467.87. The stock exchange index rose 4.60 Saturday to 1926.68, after gaining 52.57 Friday.    Volume Saturday totaled 900 million shares, while a wave of buying Friday pushed that day's total to a record 2.6 billion shares, up from 1.4 billion Thursday.    Buying in financial, AIDS-related and construction stocks propelled the market Friday in advance of a new fiscal year, which begins Wednesday. Many institutional investors that have already closed their books on the old trading year poured liquidity into the market, accounting for the massive turnover.    Buying heavily outweighed selling, and several Japanese securities firms also launched new investment trusts, adding to the increased liquidity.    Moreover, because of the huge turnover, the stock exchange in Tokyo said it will shorten its afternoon trading hours by one-half hour, effective Monday. Morning processing of stock transactions customarily lags behind on high volume days, forcing clerks at large brokerage houses to work through the lunch hour.    The exchange said the new afternoon schedule will remain in effect until further notice, though it has often returned to previous schedules once single-day turnover falls below one billion shares for a while.    In London, share prices closed higher at the end of a moderate trading day Friday, buoyed by renewed optimism for a Conservative Party victory at the next general election.    The latest political opinion poll put the Conservatives in the lead, while the Labor Party slipped even further behind.    The 100-share index closed up 10.8 at 2048.6 while the Financial Times industrialshare index was up 5.7 at 1620.6. The gold mines index advanced 4.6 to 432.8.    Despite the optimism, trading was typically quiet for a Friday.    &quot;There were no enormous deals done,&quot; said one trader, adding that overseas interest was moderate.    Among the stock groups with gains were health products and oil companies. The stores sector was the hardest hit.
