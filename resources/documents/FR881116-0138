L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003 <T3>et seq</T3>; 15 U.S.C. 2601 <T3>et seq</T3>.) authorizes the Administrator of EPA to promulgate regulationsunder section 4(a) requiring testing of chemical substances and mixturesin order to develop data relevant to determining the risks that such chemicalsubstances and mixtures may present to health and the environment. Section4(e) of TSCA established an Interagency Testing Committee to make recommendationsto the Administrator of EPA on chemical substances and mixtures to be givenpriority consideration in proposing test rules under section 4(a). Section4(e) directs the ITC to revise its list of recommendations at least every6 months as necessary. The ITC may ``designate'' up to 50 substances andmixtures at any one time for priority consideration by the Agency. Crotonaldehydeis a designated chemical. For such designations, the Agency must within12 months either intitiate rulemaking or issue in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>its reasons for not doing so. The ITC's Twenty-ThirdReport was received by the Administrator on November 1, 1988, and followsthis Notice. The Report adds six substances to the TSCA section 4(e) prioritylist.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Written and Oral Comments and Public Meetings</ITAG>EPA invites interested persons to submit detailed comments on the ITC'snew recommendations. The Agency is interested in receiving informationconcerning additional or ongoing health and safety studies on the subjectchemicals as well as information relating to the human and environmentalexposure to these chemicals.A notice is published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register </T4>adding the substances recommended in the ITC'sTwenty-Third Report to the TSCA section 8(d) Health and Safety Data ReportingRule (40 CFR Part 716), which requires the reporting of unpublished healthand safety studies on the listed chemicals. These chemicals also will beadded to the TSCA section 8(a) Preliminary Assessment Information Rule(40 CFR Part 712) published elsewhere in this issue. The section 8(a) rulerequires the reporting of production volume, use, exposure, and releaseinformation on the listed chemicals.Focus Meetings will be held to discuss relevant issues pertaining to thesechemicals and to narrow the range of issues/effects which will be the focusof the Agency's subsequent activities in responding to the ITC recommendations.The Focus Meetings will be held on December 13, 1988, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">9:30 a.m. Tris(2-chloroethyl)-phosphate, three tris(chloroprophyl)-phosphates,and tetrakis(2-chloroethyl)-ethylene disphosphate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1:00 p.m. Butyraldehyde</ITAG>They will be held at EPA Headquarters, Rm. 103 NE Mall, 401 M St., SW.,Washington, DC.

L. 94-469)provides for the testing of chemicals in commerce that may present an unreasonablerisk of injury to health or the environment. It also provides for the establishmentof a Committee (ITC), composed of representatives from eight designatedFederal agencies, to recommend chemical substances and mixtures (chemicals)to which the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) should give priority consideration for the promulgation of testingrules.Section 4(e)(1)(A) of TSCA directs the Committee to recommend to the EPAAdministrator chemicals to which the Administrator should give priorityconsideration for the promulgation of testing rules pursuant to section4(a). The Committee is required to designate those chemicals, from amongits recommendations, to which the Administrator should respond within 12months by either initiating a rulemaking proceeding under section 4(a)or publishing the Administrator's reason for not initiating such a proceeding.At least every 6 months, the Committee makes those revisions in the TSCAsection 4(e) Priority List that it determines to be necessary and transmitsthem to the EPA Administrator.As a result of its deliberations, the Committee is revising the TSCA section4(e) Priority List by the addition of 6 chemicals.The Priority List is divided into three parts: Part A contains those recommendedchemicals and groups designated for priority consideration and responseby the EPA Administrator within 12 months. Part B contains chemicals andgroups of chemicals recommended with intent-to-designate. This categorywas established by the Committee in its seventeenth report (50 FR 47603;November 19, 1985) to take advantage of rules promulgating automatic reportingrequirements for non-designated ITC recommendations under the section 8(a)Preliminary Assessment rule and the TSCA section 8(d) Health and SafetyData Reporting rule. Information received following recommendation withintent-to-designate may influence the Committee to either designate ornot designate the chemicals or groups of chemicals in a subsequent reportto the Administrator. Part C contains chemicals and groups of chemicalsthat have been recommended for priority consideration by EPA without beingdesignated for response within 12 months. The changes to the Priority Listare presented, together with the types of testing recommended, in the followingTable 1: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Additions to the Section </T4>4<T4>(e) Priority List </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[November 1988] </ITAG><H1>Chemical/Group </H1><H1>Recommended studies</H1> A. <T3>Designated for response within 12 months:</T3><ITAG tagnum="3">Crotonaldehyde \1\ CAS No. 4170-30-3 </ITAG><D>Chemical Fate: Volatilization rate from water; aerobic aquatic biodegradationrate. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Health Effects: None. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Ecological Effects: Acute toxicity to algae, fish and aquatic invertebrates.</D>B. <T3>Recommended with Intent-to-Designate: </T3><ITAG tagnum="3">Tris(2-chloroethyl)-phosphate \2\ CAS No. 115-96-8 </ITAG><D>Chemical Fate: Environmental monitoring; vapor pressure; biodegradation.</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Health Effects: None. </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Ecological Effects: Acute toxicity to aquatic and terrestrial plants;chronic toxicity to fish. </D><ITAG tagnum="3"/>Tris(chloropropyl)-phosphates, including the following: <D>Chemical Fate: Environmental monitoring; water solubility; vapor pressure;octanol/water partition coefficient; biodegradation. </D><ITAG tagnum="4">Tris(2-chloro-1-propyl) phosphate \3\ CAS No. 6145-73-9 <D>Health Effects: Acute and subchronic effects, including cholinesteraseinhibition, 90-day subchronic effects and reproductive effects.

L. 94-469). The specific mandate of the Committee isto recommend to the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) chemical substances and mixtures in commerce that should begiven priority consideration for the promulgation of testing rules to determinetheir potential hazard to human health and/or the environment. TSCA specifiesthat the Committee's recommendations shall be in the form of a PriorityList, which is to be published in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The Committee is directed by section 4(e)(1)(A)of TSCA to designate those chemicals on the Priority List to which theEPA Administrator should respond within 12 months by either initiatinga rulemaking proceeding under section 4(a) or publishing the Administrator'sreason for not initiating such a proceeding. There is no statutory timelimit for EPA response regarding chemicals that ITC has recommended butnot designated for response within 12 months.At least every 6 months, the Committee makes those revisions in the section4(e) Priority List that it determines to be necessary and transmits themto the EPA Administrator.The Committee is composed of representatives from eight statutory memberagencies and seven liaison agencies. The specific representatives and theiraffiliations are named in the front of this report. The Committee's chemicalreview procedures and priority recommendations are described in previousreports (Refs. 1 through 7). 1.2 <T3>Committee's previous reports.</T3> Twenty-two previous reports to theEPA Administrator have been issued by the Committee and published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> (Refs. 1 through 7). Ninety-six entries (seventy-sixchemicals and twenty groups of chemicals) were recommended for priorityconsideration by the EPA Administrator and designated for response within12 months. In addition, 24 chemicals and one group of chemicals were recommendedwithout being so designated. Overall, in the 22 reports to the EPA Administrator,the Committee has recommended testing for 100 chemicals and 21 groups ofchemicals. A complete list of recommended chemicals may be obtained bycontacting the ITC Executive Secretary at the following address/telephonenumber: Robert Brink, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (TS-792), 401M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 382-3820.1.3 <T3>Committee's activities during this reporting period.</T3> Between April22, 1988 and October 20, 1988, the Committee continued to review chemicalsfrom its fifth and sixth scoring exercises, and from nominations by MemberAgencies, Liaison Agencies and State Agencies.The Committee contacted chemical manufacturers and trade associations torequest information that would be of value in its deliberations. Most ofthose contacted provided unpublished information on current production,exposure, uses, and effects of chemicals under study by the Committee.During this reporting period, the Committee reviewed available informationon 54 chemicals. Six were selected for addition to the section 4(e) PriorityList, and twenty-one were deferred indefinitely. The remaining chemicalsare still under study. In its twentieth report to the EPA Administrator (Ref. 5, ITC, 1987), theCommittee placed ethylbenzene (CAS No. 100-41-4) on the Priority List inthe ``Recommended with Intent-to-Designate'' category. The Committee recommededthat ethylbenzene be tested for acute toxicity to freshwater algae andinvertebrates and to saltwater algae, invertebrates and fish. Subsequently,the Committee learned that acute toxicity testing of ethylbenzene withfreshwater invertebrates had recently been completed at the Universityof Wisconsin. As noted in the twenty-first and twenty-second reports, theCommittee also was informed that a consortium of ethylbenzene producers,the Styrene and Ethylbenzene Association, voluntarily sponsored studieson the other acute toxicity tests recommended by the Committee. The Committeedeferred a decision on whether or not to designate ethylbenzene pendinga review of the data developed during the above studies. The Committeehas reviewed the data developed in those studies and has concluded thatall of the data gaps identified in the twentieth report have been satisfactorilyresolved. Therefore, the Committee has decided that ethylbenzene shouldbe removed from the Priority List. 1.4 <T3>The TSCA section 4(e) Priority List.</T3> Section 4(e)(1)(B) of TSCAdirects the Committee to: ``* * * make such revisions in the [priority]list as it determines to be necessary and * * * transmit them to the Administratortogether with the Committee's reasons for the revisions.'' Under this authority,the Committee is revising the Priority List by adding six chemicals: tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate(CAS No. 115-96-8), tris(2-chloro-l-propyl)-phosphate (CAS No. 6145-73-9),tris(l-choloro-2-propyl)phosphate (CAS No. 13674-84-5), tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate(CAS No. 13674-87-8), tetrakis(2-chloroethyl)ethylene diphosphate (CASNo. 33125-86-9), and butyraldehyde (CAS No. 123-72-8). In addition, theCommittee is designating, for repsonse within 12 months, crotonaldehyde,which was recommended with intent-to-designate in the twenty-second report.Two chemicals are being removed from the Priority List at this time. Methylethyl ketoxime (CAS No. 96-29-7) was the subject of a Notice of ProposedRulemaking (53 FR 35838; September 15, 1988) and ethylbenzene (CAS No.100-41-4) is being removed for the reasons given in section 1.3.With the six new recommendations and two removals noted in this report,twenty-one entries now appear on the section 4(e) Priority List. The PriorityList is divided in the following Table 2 into three parts; namely, A. Chemicalsand Groups of Chemicals Designated for Response Within 12 Months, B. Chemicalsand Groups of Chemicals Recommended with Intent-to-Designate, and C. Chemicalsand Groups of Chemicals Recommended Without Being Designated for ResponseWithin 12 Months.

In addition, theCommittee is designating for response within 12 months one chemical thatwas recommended with intent-to-designate in the twenty-second report. Thedesignated chemical is crotonaldehyde (CAS No. 4170-30-3). The recommendationof these chemicals is made after considering the factors identified insection 4(e)(1)(A) and other relevant information, as well as the professionaljudgment of Committee members.2.2 <T3>Chemicals designated for response within 12 months</T3>_2.2.a <T3>Crotonaldehyde.</T3> In the twenty-second report to the Administratorof EPA (53 FR 18196) crotonaldehyde was recommended with intent-to-designate.The rationale for that recommendation appears in the twenty-second report.Information reviewed by the Committee in response to the twenty-secondreport includes any public comments on the Committee's recommendations;production volume, use, exposure and release information reported by manufacturersof crotonaldehyde under the TSCA section 8(a) Preliminary Assessment rule;health and safety studies submitted under TSCA 8(d) Health and Safety DataReport rule; and any unpublished and published data available to the Committee.After reviewing the information, the Committee concluded that data arestill lacking on certain chemical fate factors and ecological effects.For these reasons and for the reasons previously presented (53 FR 18196)the Committee is now designating crotonaldehyde for response within 12months and recommending that it be tested for the following:1. <T3>Chemical fate.</T3> Volatilization rate from water; aerobic aquaticbiodegradation rate.2. <T3>Health effects.</T3> None.3. <T3>Ecological effects.</T3> Acute toxicity to algae, fish and aquaticinvertebrates.2.3 <T3>Chemicals recommended with intent-to-designate</T3>_2.3.a <T3>Tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate_Summary of recommended studies.</T3> Itis recommended that tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP) be tested for thefollowing:1. <T3>Chemical Fate.</T3> Environmental monitoring; vapor pressure; biodegradation.2. <T3>Health Effects.</T3> None.3. <T3>Environmental Effects.</T3> Acute toxicity to aquatic and terrestrialplants; chronic toxicity to fish.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Physical and Chemical Information </T4><H1>CAS No. </H1><H1>115-96-8</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Synonyms: <D>Ethanol, 2-chloro, phosphate (3:1) (9CI); </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Tris (</D><T4>b</T4>-chloroethyl) phosphate;<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>FYROL CEF;</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>FYROL PCF;</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Celluflex CEF;</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Disflamol TCA;</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Niax Flame Retardant 3CF.</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>TCEP. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Acronym: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D> </D>Structural Formula: <ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D> </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D> </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D> </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D> </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D> </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D> </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D> </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D> </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D> </D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D> </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Empirical Formula <D>C</D><T2>6</T2><T2>12</T2>CH<T2>3</T2>O<T2>4</T2>P.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Molecular Weight <D>285.5.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Melting Point (anddegrees;C) <D>^55 (Ref. 25, Sandmeyer and Kirwin, 1981).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Boiling Point (anddegrees;C) <D>330 (Ref. 2, Aldrich, 1986).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Vapor Pressure (mmHg) <D>No information was found.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Solubility in Water (mg/L); <D>7,943 (Ref. 31, Yoshioka et al., 1986).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Specific Gravity: <D>1.425 @ 20/20</D>anddegrees; (Ref. 28, Sax and Lewis, 1987). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Log Octanol/Water Partition Coefficient (log P) <D>1.7 (Ref. 31, Yoshioka et al., 1986).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Henry's Law Constant: <D>1.81 x 10</D>^7 atm m3/mol (Ref. 21, Muir, 1984). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Adsorption Coefficient (Koc): <D>5.2 (Estimated; Ref. 4, CHEMEST, 1988).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Description of Chemical: <D>Colorless liquid with slight odor (Ref. 17, Lefaux, 1968).</D></ITAG></ITAG>Rationale for Recommendations <ITAG tagnum="81">I. Exposure Information </ITAG>A. <T3>Production/use/release to the environment. </T3>Tris (2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP) is produced in substantial but CBI annual amounts in theU.S. Actual production volumes are considered to be confidential businessinformation. It is used as a flame retardant additive for flexible andrigid polyurethane and polyisocyanurate foams, carpet-backing, flame-retardantpaints and lacquers, various resins, coatings and adhesives (Ref. 15, Kirk-Othmer,1980). The major use appears to be in foams such as the flexible foamsused in automobiles and furniture and rigid foams for building insulationmaterials. It is unlikely that there is any natural production of TCEP.Most of the production eventually will be released to the environment asfurniture, and landfills. Some may be released during thermal decomposition(accidental fires and waste incineration). Muir (Ref. 21, 1984) cited areport by Cho and Klaus (1980) stating that 41 percent of TCEP remainsintact after thermal oxidation in air at 370anddegrees;C. However, Pacioreket al. (Ref. 23, 1978) reported that 85 percent of the TCEP chlorine wasaccounted for in volatile products of degradation at 370anddegrees;C, whichindicates that no more than 15 percent of the TCEP was left undegraded.B. <T3>Evidence for environmental exposure.</T3> TCEP, in common with manysimilar tris(haloalkyl)phosphates, has been found in numerous environmentalsamples throughout the world, at very low concentrations. TCEP was foundin river waters in Japan at 17 to 350 ng/L at 14 of 16 sites at Kitakyushu(Ref. 12, Ishikawa et al., 1985b) and in Canadian rivers at 13 sites, witha mean concentration of 8.7 ng/L (Ref. 29, Williams and LeBel, 1981). TCEPwas detected in the Netherlands in the river Waal (Ref. 19, Meijers andVan der Leer, 1976) and the Rhine (Ref. 24, Piet et al., 1987). TCEP waspresent in ground water from two wells at Fort Devens, MA at concentrationsof 0.28 and 0.81 ug/L (Ref. 3, Bedient et al., 1983; Ref. 10, Hutchinset al., 1984). Water from the Great Lakes contained TCEP at a mean concentrationof 1.7 ng/L at ten Canadian sites (Ref. 30, Williams and LeBel, 1981) andat concentrations of 3 to 9.6 ng/L at 4 of 5 sites in a later report (Ref.16, LeBel et al., 1987). Samples from 10 coastal sites in Japan contained14 to 60 ng/L in the seawater (Ref. 12, Ishikawa et al., 1985b). Sewagetreatment facilities in Japan contained from 540 to 1,200 ng/L TCEP inthe influent to the plants and 500 to 1,200 ng/L in the effluents. Similarly,at night soil treatment facilities, the influent contained 190 to 1,500ng/L TCEP and the effluents were found to have 190 to 1,500 ng/L (Ref.13, Ishikawa et al., 1985c). Five river and ocean sediment samples fromJapan contained 13 to 28 ng TCEP/g of sediment. None was detected in asixth sample (Ref. 12, Ishikawa et al., 1985b). TCEP was detected but notquantified in ambient air at Kitakyushu, Japan (Ref. 9, Haraguchi et al.,1985). In a survey of infant and toddler dietary intake from October 1978 throughSeptember 1979, Gartrell et al. (Ref. 7, 1985a) reported finding TCEP incomposite U.S. drinking water at an average concentration of 0.3 ug/L.Drinking water in Japan, examined over a 1-year period, contained 2 to60.5 ng/L TCEP, with a mean concentration of 17.4 ng/L (Ref. 1, Adachiet al., 1984). Fifteen pooled U.S. drinking water samples contained anaverage of 2.6 ng/L TCEP (Ref. 18, Lucas, 1984) and Millington et al. (Ref.20, 1983) reported finding TCEP on activated carbon filter beds used at40 U.S. drinking water treatment plants. In a study of drinking water samplesin England, Fielding et al. (Ref. 6, 1981) found TCEP in one of fourteensamples. LeBel et al. (Ref. 16, 1987) found TCEP at 0.3 to 9.2 ng/L induplicate drinking water samples from six sites in eastern Ontario. Drinkingwater from 22 other Canadian cities contained TCEP at 0.3 to 52 ng/L whilewater from 7 other cities contained no detectable TCEP (Ref. 29, Williamsand LeBel, 1981). In a survey of drinking water from the Great Lakes attwelve Canadian cities, Williams et al. (Ref. 30, 1982) found concentrationsof TCEP at 0.3 to 13.8 ng/L in water at 11 of the cities. In a survey ofinfant and toddler diets from October 1979 through September 1980, Gartrellet al. (Ref. 8, 1985b) reported TCEP in composite fruit and fruit juicesamples at an average concentration of 0.2 ug/L. It was not detected inother foods tested. Fish from the Okayama Prefecture in Japan containedfrom less than 0.005 ug/g up to 0.019 ug/g TCEP (Ref. 14, Kenmochi et al.,1981). TCEP and other widely used tris(chloroalkyl)phosphate flame retardantsappear to be widely distributed in the environment, especially in water,at low concentrations. It is not known whether the environmental concentrationsare increasing with time or whether these anthropogenic phosphates haveattained some steady-state, low-level concentrations. <ITAG tagnum="81">II. Chemical Fate Information </ITAG>A. <T3>Transport.</T3> The water solubility of TCEP is reported to be from7,000 (Ref. 17, LeFaux, 1968) to 8,300 mg/L (Ref. 11, Ichikawa et al.,1985a). A measured value of 7,943 mg/L was reported by Yoshioka et al.(Ref. 31, 1986). A measured value for the log octanol/water partition coefficientwas reported as 1.7 (Ref. 31, Yoshioka et al., 1986). These data indicatethat TCEP, following release to the environment, will partition largelyto water with little accumulation in sediments or biota. Vapor pressuredata at environmentally relevant temperatures were not found, but the Henry'sLaw constant reported by Muir (Ref. 21, 1984) indicates no significantvolatilization from water. The monitoring evidence (see preceding paragraphI.B.) demonstrates widespread occurrence of TCEP in water with some partitioningto air, sediments and biolipids. B. <T3>Persistence.</T3> The trialkylphosphates, in general, are resistantto hydrolysis and free-radical oxidations although hydrolysis at the pHof sea water (approximtely 8.5) may be significant. TCEP is expected todemonstrate similar resistance to hydrolysis and oxidation, although nodata were found. Biodegradation is probably the major degradation mechanismin nature but the available data, which indicate that biodegradation isslow, are mostly circumstantial. There are reports of very little biodegradationof TCEP as it passes through drinking water sand filtration units (Ref.24, Piet et al., 1981) and through sewage treatment and night soil treatmentfacilities (Ref. 11, Ishikawa et al., 1985a). TCEP was reported to be hardlydegraded after 50 hours in activated sludge (Ref. 11, Ishikawa, et al.,1985a). C. <T3>Rationale for chemical fate recommendations.</T3> There is widespreadcontamination of the environment by TCEP (and other tris(chloroalkyl)phosphates)at very low concentrations. There is some evidence that TCEP may be resistantto biodegradation. Based on its water solubility and octanol/water partitioncoefficients, TCEP released to the environment is expected to partitionlargely to water. No data were found on its vapor pressure at ambient temperatures.Since TCEP has been and will continue to be released to both water andsoil (landfill) environments, there is a need to obtain measured vaporpressure data and to evaluate its biodegradability in natural waters. Italso is recommended that appropriate follow-on monitoring studies be conductedat sites sampled in the 1970's and early 1980's in an attempt to determinewhether environmental concentrations are increasing with time.<ITAG tagnum="81">III. Biological Effects of Concern to Human Health</ITAG>A two-year gavage study with rats and mice has recently been completedunder the National Toxicology Program (Ref. 22, NTP, 1988) and is currentlyin the histopathology stages. Given this information, the Committee hasdeferred its review of TCEP for health effects pending receipt and reviewof data from the NTP study.<ITAG tagnum="81">IV. Ecological Effects of Concern</ITAG>A. <T3>Acute and subchronic (short-term) effects.</T3> The 96-hour LC50 ofTCEP was reported to be 210 mg/L with killifish (<T3>Orizias latipes</T3>) and 90 mg/L with goldfish (<T3>Carassius auratus</T3>) (Ref. 26, Sasaki et al., 1981). These authorsalso reported spine deformations (caused by convulsive muscle contractions)in killifish with exposure to 200 mg/L of TCEP for 72 hours and protrusionof killifish eyes after 24 to 72 hours exposure to 200 mg/L. Yoshioka etal. (Ref. 31, 1986) reported LC50 values of 251 mg/L with red killifish(<T3>Orizias latipes</T3>), 1,000 mg/L with a daphnia species (<T3>Moina macrocopa</T3>) and 158 mg/L with a flatworm (<T3>Dugesia japonica</T3>). Another literature report (Ref. 5, Eldefrawiet al., 1977) stated that 5 mg/L TCEP had no observable effects on goldfishafter 7 days exposure.B. <T3>Chronic (long-term) effects.</T3> No information on chronic effectswas found. Sasaki et al. (Ref. 26, 1981), as noted in the preceding paragraph,reported spine deformations and eye bulging in killifish exposed to 200mg/L for 72 hours. Eldefrawi et al. (Ref. 5, 1977) reported that TCEP isa weak inhibitor of acetyl-cholinesterase and this may produce some chroniceffects.C. <T3>Other ecological effects (biological, behavioral, or ecosystem processes).</T3>No information was found.D. <T3>Bioconcentration and food-chain transport.</T3> The bioconcentrationof TCEP was examined by Sasaki et al. (Ref. 26, 1981 and Ref. 27, 1982)in both static and continuous-flow studies. Static tests with killifishand goldfish showed bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of 2 and 1, respectively.A BCF of 1 was observed for killifish in continuous-flow studies over a10-day period. When the fish were placed in clean water there was rapiddepuration with half gone in 0.7 hours after cessation of exposure.E. <T3>Rationale for ecological effects recommendation.</T3> The widespreadoccurrence of TCEP in environmental samples raises concerns for its ecologicaleffects. On the other hand, the available data indicate that acute toxicitylevels for fish and aquatic invertebrates are 1,000 times or more greaterthan observed environmental concentrations. However, there were no dataon plants and it is recommended that TCEP be tested for acute toxicityto aquatic and terrestrial plants. There appear to be chronic exposuresto low concentrations of TCEP in aquatic environments and reports of spinedeformations raise concerns for chronic effects. Therefore, it is recommendedthat TCEP also be tested for chronic toxicity to fish.<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Adachi, K., Mitsuhaski, T., and Ohkuni, N. ``Pesticides and trialkylphosphates in tap water.'' <T3>Hyogo-ken Eisei Kenkyusho Kenkyu Hokoku.</T3> 19:1-6 (1984).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Aldrich.

Exposure Information</ITAG>A. <T3>Production/use/release to environment. </T3>TCPP, TCIP and TDCP areeach produced in substantial annual amounts in the U.S. but actual productionvolumes are classified as confidential business information. TCPP and TDCPare used as additive flame retardants in various plastic materials. TDCPis known to be used primarily in flexible polyurethane foams. No informationwas found on the use of TCIP but it appears likely that it too is usedas an additive flame retardant. Most of the production eventually willbe released to the environment as the plastic materials containing themare scrapped or disposed of in dumps and landfills. Some may be releasedduring thermal decomposition (accidental fires and waste incineration).A report by Cho and Klaus (1980) stating that 32 percent of TDCP remainsintact after thermal oxidation in air at 370anddegrees; C was cited by Muir(Ref. 11, 1984). It was reported by Paciorek et al. (Ref. 12, 1978) thatTDCP underwent 68 percent thermal oxidation at 370anddegrees; C. It is unlikelythat there is any natural production of these phosphates.B. <T3>Evidence for environmental exposure. </T3>No information was foundon TCPP or TCIP and there was no indication that they have been lookedfor in the environment. TDCP, in common with many similar tris(haloalkyl)phosphates,has been found in many environmental samples throughout the world, at verylow concentrations. TDCP was found in Great Lakes water at 4 of 5 Canadiansites (Ref. 9, LeBel et al., 1987). TDCP was found by LeBel et al. (Ref.7, 1981) at 0.2 to 1.8 ng/L in drinking water at six eastern Ontario sites.Drinking water from 15 other Canadian cities contained TDCP at 0.3 to 23ng/L while water from 14 other cities contained no detectable TDCP (Ref.21, Williams and LeBel, 1981). In a survey of drinking water from the GreatLakes at twelve Canadian Cities, Williams et al. (Ref. 22, 1982) foundconcentrations of TDCP at 0.1 to 15.7 ng/L. A study of activated carbonfilter beds used at 40 U.S. drinking water treatment plants found tris(chloropropyl)phosphate(not further identified) on the carbon (Ref. 11, Millington et al., 1983).Fish and shellfish from the Okayama prefecture in Japan were reported tocontain tris(2, 3-dichloropropyl)phosphate (Ref. 6, Kenmochi et al., 1981).In an examination of Swedish products thought to contain additive flameretardants (Ref. 16, Sellestroem and Jansson, 1987), 11 of 104 sampleswere found to contain TDCP. It was most common in polyurethane productssuch as sound absorbing materials and liners for cars and buses. Thesesame authors also examined the contents of vacuum cleaner bags from onenew and one older (15-year old) house and found TDCP in the dust from theolder house.In analyses of human adipose tissues, LeBel and Williams (Ref. 8, 1983)found TDCP in 5 of 16 samples at 0.5 to 110 ng/g. TDCP also was found at5 to 50 ppb in 34 of 123 human seminal plasma samples (Ref. 3, Hudec etal. 1981).Japanese studies have reported finding tris(chloropropyl)-phosphate (CASNo. 26248-87-3) and tris(dichloropropyl)phosphate (CAS No. 26604-51-3)(Ref. 1, Haraguchi et al., 1985) and tris(3-chloropropyl)phosphate (CASNo. 1067-98-7) and tris(2, 3-dichloropropyl)phosphate (CAS No. 78-43-3)(Ref. 4, Ishikawa et al., 1985a) in air and treatment plant influents andeffluents in Japan. The first three CAS numbers are not listed in the TSCAInventory and the fourth CAS number is a compound that is produced in lowamounts in the U.S. It may be that Japanese industry uses tris(chloropropyl)phosphateflame retardants not commonly used in the U.S. and that those compoundsmay be introduced into the U.S. environment from imported products.TDCP and other widely used tris(chloroalkyl)phosphate flame retardantsappear to be widely distributed in the environment. When they are lookedfor, they often are found. No information was found on monitoring studiesdesigned to look for TCPP or TCIP and monitoring should be conducted ifcontinued high production and use are confirmed. Additional monitoringstudies to evaluate the concentrations of TDCP in the environment shouldbe conducted to determine whether its concentration in the environmentis increasing with time.<ITAG tagnum="81">I. Chemical Fate Information</ITAG> A. <T3>Transport. </T3>The water solubility of TDCP is reported to be from7 to 1,000 mg/L (Ref. 2, Hollifield, 1981, Ref. 11, Muir, 1984, Ref. 18,Stauffer, 1979). The log octanol/water partition coefficient is reportedto be 3.8 (Ref. 14, Sasaki et al., 1981). No information was found forTCPP and TCIP. The monitoring evidence (see I.B., above) for TDCP demonstrateswidespread occurrence of TDCP in water with some partitioning to sedimentsand biolipids. TCPP and TCIP are expected to behave similarly. B. <T3>Persistence. </T3>No information was found for TCPP, TCIP or TDCP.However, Ishikawa et al. (Ref. 5, 1985b) reported that influent and effluentdata for activated sludge treatment showed no biodegradation of tris(chloropropyl)phosphate(CAS No. 1067-98-7) and tris(2,3-dichloropropyl)phosphate (CAS No. 78-43-3).C. <T3>Rationale for chemical fate recommendations. </T3>There is widespreadcontamination of the environment by TDCP. There may be persistent backgroundlevels of TCPP and TCIP in the environment but this is unknown. There isa need to conduct appropriate monitoring studies to determine if TCDD andTCIP, like similar tris(chloroalkyl)phosphate flame retardants, are presentin the environment at low concentrations and whether the environmentalconcentrations of TDCP are increasing. There also is a need to obtain reliable,measured water solubility, vapor pressure and octanol/water partition coefficientdata on these flame retardants to better estimate their transport in theenvironment and to evaluate their biodegradability in natural waters. <ITAG tagnum="81">III. Biological Effects of Concern to Human Health</ITAG> The Committee determined that tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (CASNo. 13674-87-8) has been studied extensively for health effects and concludedthat additional studies are not required. Therefore, health effects testingis not being recommended at this time. A. <T3>Metabolism and toxicokinetics. </T3>No information was found for TCPPor TCIP. B. <T3>Acute (short-term) effects. </T3>No information was found for TCPP.An LD50 of 56 mg/kg, administered intravenously in mice, was found forTCIP (U.S. Army data, cited in Ref. 13, RTECS, 1988). The reliability ofthis information cannot be assessed since experimental details are notavailable. Stauffer (cited in Ref. 20, USEPA, 1981) reported studies on the neurotoxicpotential of TDCP, a structurally similar phosphate, on adult hens. At10 g/kg, the maximum tolerated dose, there was 7 percent inhibition ofbrain neurotoxic esterase. In positive controls, treated with tri-o-cresylphospate at 0.5 g/kg, there was an 85 percent inhibition. No subchronic effects data were found for TCIP. The neurotoxic potentialof TCPP in adult white Leghorn hens was evaluated by Sprague et al. (Ref.17, 1981). A group of 18 hens received an initial oral dose of 13.23 gTCPP/kg, followed by the same treatment 3 weeks later. The animals weresacrificed 3 weeks after the second dose. Loss of body weight, transientreductions in food consumption and one death were reported for the treatedanimals. Egg production ceased shortly after the first dose and there wassevere feather loss. No behavioral or histological evidence of delayedneurotoxicity was observed. C. <T3>Genotoxicity. </T3>No information was found for TCPP or TCIP. D. <T3>Oncogenicity. </T3>No information was found for TCPP or TCIP. A structurallysimilar compound, TDCP, was tested for oncogenicity in rats of both sexesand produced a significantly increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomaand interstitial cell tumors of the testes (Ref. 19, Stauffer, 1981). E. <T3>Chronic (long-term) effects. </T3>No information was found for TCPPor TCIP. F. <T3>Reproductive and developmental effects. </T3>No information was foundfor TCPP or TCIP.G. <T3>Observations in humans. </T3>No information was found for TCPP or TCIP.H. <T3>Rationale for health effects recommendations. </T3>Three tris(chloropropyl)phosphates(TCPP, TCIP and TDCP) are produced in substantial amounts in the U.S. andused as additive flame retardants. TDCP is widely distributed in the environmentat low concentrations. No exposure information (occupational, consumeror environmental) is available for TCPP or TCIP. It is assumed that useof the latter two compounds as flame retardants will eventually lead tothe release of TCPP and TCIP to the environment. TDCP appears to be wellstudied for potential health effects but there is very little health effectsinformation on TCIP and TCPP. The health effects information is limitedto a LD50 for TCIP in mice by intravenous exposure and a subchronic evaluationof the neurotoxic potential of TCPP in hens. An evaluation of neurotoxicityshould be conducted for a period of 90 days. In view of the lack of health effects information on TCIP and TCPP andgiven the acute effects, oncogenicity and neurotoxicity of TDCP, it isrecommended that TCIP and TCPP be tested for acute effects, including cholinesteraseinhibition, 90-day subchronic effects and reproductive effects. Based onthe results of the recommended studies, the need for long-term studiesshould be considered. <ITAG tagnum="81">IV. Ecological Effects of Concern</ITAG> A. <T3>Acute and subchronic (short-term) effects. </T3>No information wasfound for TCPP or TCIP. The 96-hr LC50 for TDCP was reported to be 3.6 mg/L with killifish and5.1 mg/L with goldfish (Ref. 14, Saaski et al., 1981). These authors alsoreported spine deformations (caused by convulsive muscle contractions)in killifish after 24 hours exposure at 3.5 mg/L TDCP. B. <T3>Chronic (long-term) effects. </T3>No information on chronic effectswas found. However, as noted in the preceding paragraph, Sasaki et al.(Ref. 14, 1981) reported spine deformations in killifish exposed to 3.5mg/L TDCP for 24 hours. C. <T3>Other ecological effects. </T3>No information was found. D. <T3>Bioconcentration and food-chain transport. </T3>The bioconcentrationof TDCP was examined by Sasaki et al. (Ref. 14, 1981 and Ref. 15, 1982)in both static and continuous flow studies. Static tests with killifishand goldfish showed bioconcentration factors of 47 to 107 with killifishand 3 to 5 with goldfish. In continuous-flow studies, the bioconcentrationfactor for TDCP was 31 to 59 for up to 32 days exposure. There was a rapiddepuration following cessation of exposure to TDCP in the continuous-flowstudies, with half gone in 1.7 hours. E. <T3>Rationale for ecological effects recommendations. </T3>The widespreadoccurrence of TDCP in environmental samples and the likely contaminationof the environment by TCPP and TCIP raise concerns for their ecologicaleffects. Each should be tested for acute toxicity to fish, aquatic invertebratesand algae to better evaluate the hazard associated with chronic exposuresto low environmental concentrations. The observation of spine deformationsin fish exposed to TDCP and the widespread occurrence of TDCP at low concentrationsalso raises concerns for chronic effects. It is recommended that each ofthese tris(chloropropyl)-phosphates be tested for chronic toxicity to fish.<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Haraguchi, K., Yamashita, T., and Shigemori, N. ``Sampling andanalysis of phosphoric acid triesters in ambient air.'' <T3>Taiki Osen Gakkaishi.</T3> 20:407-415 (1985).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Hollifield, H.C. ``Rapid nephelometric estimate of water solubilityof highly insoluble organic chemicals of environmental interests,'' <T3>Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology.</T3> 23:579-586(1979).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Hudec, T., Thean, J., Kuehl, D., and Dougherty, R.C. ``Tris(dichloropropyl)phosphate,a mutagenic flame retardant: frequent occurrence in human seminal plasma,''<T3>Science.</T3> 211:951-952 (1981).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Ishikawa, S., Shigezumi, K., Yasuda, K., and Shigemori, N. ``Determinationof organic phosphate esters in factory effluent and domestic effluent.''<T3>Suishitsu Odaka Kenkyu.</T3> 8:529-535 (1985a).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Ishikawa, S., Shigezumi, K., Yasuda, K., and Shigemori, N. ``Behaviorof organic phosphate esters in several waste water treatment processes.''<T3>Suishitsu Odaka Kenkyu.</T3> 8:799-807 (1985b).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) Kenmochi, U., Matsunaga, K. and Ishida, R. ``The effects of environmentalpollutants on biological systems. 6. organic phosphates in environments.''<T3>Okayama-ken Kankyo Hoken Senta Nenpo.</T3> 5:167-175 (1981).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(7) LeBel, G.L., Williams, D.T., and Benoit, F.M. ``Gas chromatographicdetermination of trialkyl/aryl phosphates in drinking water following isolationusing macroreticular resin.'' <T3>Journal of Association of Official Analytical Chemists.</T3> 64:991-998(1981).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(8) LeBel, G.L., and Williams, D.T. ``Determination of organic phosphatetriesters in human adipose tissue.'' <T3>Journal of Association of Official Analytical Chemists.</T3> 66:691-699(1983).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(9) LeBel, G.L., Williams, D.T., and Benoit, F.M. ``Use of large-volumeresin cartridges for the determination of organic contaminants in drinkingwater derived from the Great Lakes.'' <T3>Advances in Chemistry Series.</T3> 214:309-325 (1987).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(10) Millington, D.C., Bertino, D.J., Kamei, T., and Christman, R.F.``Analysis of organic compounds adsorbed on granular activated carbon filtersused in treatment plants.'' <T3>Water Chlorination, Environmental Impact and Health Effects.</T3> Vol.4, Book 1, Jolley, R.L. et al.

Exposure Information</ITAG>A. <T3>Production/use.</T3> Tetrakis(2-chloroethyl)ethylene diphosphate (TCEEP)is produced in substantial annual amounts in the U.S. but actual productionvolumes are classified as confidential business information. TCEEP is usedas an additive flame retardant in flexible polyurethane foams and may beused as a flame retardant in various resins. There is no known naturalproduction of TCEEP.B. <T3>Environmental release.</T3> It is likely that most of the TCEEP productionis eventually released to the environment as furniture, automobiles, constructionmaterials, etc. are scrapped and disposed of in dumps and landfills. SomeTCEEP may be released during thermal decomposition (in accidental firesand incinerators) but no information was found on thermal decomposition.C. <T3>Evidence for environmental exposure.</T3> No information was found.Related chloroalkyl phosphate flame retardants (e.g., tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphateand tris(1,3-dichloropropyl)-phsophate), when looked for in the environment,have been found at low concentrations in a wide variety of environmentalmedia in industrialized countries. It is not known whether anyone has lookedfor TCEEP in the environment.<ITAG tagnum="81">II. Chemical Fate Information</ITAG>A. <T3>Transport.</T3> The water solubility, vapor pressure and estimatedoctanol/water partition coefficient for TCEEP suggest significant transportto both air and water, with little sorption to soil or sediment. The calculatedHenry's law constant, if true, would produce a half-life for volatilizationfrom water of about 1 to 2 days. A related phosphate, the tris(2-chloroethyl)-phosphate,has a reported Henry's constant of 1.81 x 10^7 atm m3/mol for a predictedhalf-life in water of about 1.4 years. It is difficult to believe thatthere would be such a great difference between these two phosphates andthe water solubility and vapor pressure used to calculate the Henry's constantsshould be reliably measured. If this phosphate behaves similarly to thetris(chloroalkyl)phosphate flame retardants, it will partition largelyto water following release to the environment.B. <T3>Persistence.</T3> No information was found.C. <T3>Rationale for chemical fate and recommendations.</T3> TCEEP, like therelated tris(chloroalkyl)phosphate flame retardants, may partition largelyto the aquatic environment and be relatively persistent. The related tris(chloroalkyl)phospateshave been found throughout the industrialized world in a variety of environmentalmedia at low concentrations. There is a need for monitoring studies thatlook for TCEEP to determine if it also appears at low concentrations inthe environment. In addition, it is recommended that studies be conductedto determine the water solubility, vapor pressure and octanol/water partitioncoefficient of TCEEP and to evaluate its biodegradability in natural waters.<ITAG tagnum="81">III. Biological Effects of Concern to Human Health</ITAG>The Committee, at the conclusion of its Sixth Scoring Exercise, concludedthat it would not review TCEEP for health effects (52 FR 10409, April 1,1987). Therefore, no health effects studies are being recommended at thistime.<ITAG tagnum="81">IV.

Exposure Information</ITAG>A. <T3>Production/use/release to environment. </T3>Butyraldehyde is producedand used in the U.S. at a rate in excess of one billion pounds per year.SRI reported U.S. production of butyraldehyde in 1987 at 1.835 billionpounds by five manufacturers at six sites spread across Texas (Ref. 52,SRI International, 1987). Greater than 90 percent of the production isused as a chemical intermediate to synthesize n-butanol and 2-ethylhexanol.Domestic production of n-butanol and 2-ethylhexanol was 935 million and638 million pounds, respectively, in 1987 (Ref. 9, Candamp;EN, 1988). Otherimportant uses for butyraldehyde include its use as a solvent for surfacecoatings and its combination with polyvinyl alcohol to form a resin inlaminated safety glass (Ref. 8, CEH, 1985).Butyraldehyde occurs naturally in many plants, including fruits and vegetables,and in cheese, meats and wines. It has FDA approval as a direct food additivefor use as a synthetic flavoring substance and as an indirect food additiveas a component of packaging (21 CFR 172.515; 21 CFR 175.105; and Ref. 44,Opdyke, 1979).The major releases of butyraldehyde to the environment will occur at themanufacturing sites in Texas and at major use sites elsewhere in the U.S.This volatile water soluble chemical may be released to water and air insignificant quantities. One company (Ref. 14, Eastman, 1988) reported 1987emissions at its Texas plant of about 831,000 pounds with 90 percent ofthe emissions listed as fugitive emissions to air. Toxic chemical releaseinventory reporting forms submitted to the EPA in response to the ToxicChemical Release Reporting rule (53 FR 4500; February 16, 1988) provideinformation on substantial releases to air (from 54,000 to 836,000 lbs.per year) at six manufacturing and use sites (Ref. 55, USEPA, 1988).B. <T3>Evidence for human and environmental exposure. </T3>According to theNational Occupational Hazard Survey (NOHS) conducted by the National Institutefor Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) from 1972 to 1974, 1,259 workerswere potentially exposed to butyraldehyde in the workplace in 1970 (Ref.38, NIOSH, 1976). Preliminary data available from the National OccupationalExposure Survey (NOES), conducted by NIOSH from 1980 to 1983, indicatethat 5,392 workers, including 950 women, were potentially exposed to butyraldehydein the workplace in 1980 (Ref. 39, NIOSH, 1984). Since domestic productionhas been increasing since 1982 (Ref. 56, USITC 1983) it is expected thatmore workers are exposed today.Occupational exposure limits have not been established by the AmericanConference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists or the Occupational Safetyand Health Administration.One company (Ref. 14, Eastman, 1988) reported that the major points ofworker exposure to n-butyraldehyde are in sampling, loading, and unloadingshipping containers, and maintaining the equipment. Also, during productionat its Texas plant, from 4 to 8 workers are potentially exposed daily,and from 1 to 2 maintenance workers are potentially exposed for approximately120 days per year. The same company reported that during use of n-butyraldehydeto manufacture other chemicals, 12 to 18 workers are potentially exposedat its Tennessee plant. These processes run from 180 to 360 days per year.Personal monitoring of production workers (42 samples) indicated air concentrationsof n-butyraldehyde averaging less than 1.0 ppm (8-hour TWA) with no sampleabove 1.25 ppm. Personal monitoring of materials handling workers (7 samples)indicated a geometric mean (8-hour TWA) of 3.7 ppm n-butyraldehyde. Fiveof the seven samples were under 1.0 ppm, the other two were 21.3 and 4.57ppm. (Ref. 14, Eastman, 1988).Another company (Ref. 26, Hoechst-Celanese, 1988) reported that 120 employeeswere working in the butyraldehyde unit of its Texas processing plant. Itreported no monitoring data collected in previous years, and only one samplecollected in 1988 which ``was 1 ppm for an 8 hour period.'' It was notreported whether this was a personal or area sample. Its Texas purificationplant (Ref. 26, Hoechst-Celanese, 1988) reported 4 to 6 workers exposedto n-butyraldehyde with monitoring data indicating exposure levels lessthan 10 ppm. However, no information was given concerning the collectionof monitoring data.There are no monitoring data available showing general population exposureto n-butyraldehyde. Exposures may be significant for populations livingnear major manufacturing sites since toxic release information indicatessubstantial fugitive emissions from manufacturing and use sites (Ref. 14,Eastman, 1988; Ref. 55, USEPA, 1988). One company (Ref. 26, Hoechst-Celanese,1988), however, reported community exposure near its Texas processing plantto be less than 0.0004 ppm n-butyraldehyde although fugitive emissionsof butyraldehyde at the plant exceeded 106,000 pounds per year. Detailsof the sampling and other procedures used to determine this number werenot reported.Butyraldehyde was detected but not quantified in the respired air of aheterogenous nonsmoking control population living in Chicago and the surroundingsuburbs; however, it was not detected in the respired air of two otherpopulations examined in the study: A prediabetic group and a diabetic group.The total sample was 62 persons. The authors classified butyraldehyde asa physiologic volatile metabolite but did not suggest a mechanism for itsgeneration (Ref. 34, Krotoszynski and O'Neill, 1982).No information was found concerning drinking water exposures to n-butyraldehyde.Many of the monitoring studies that report environmental concentrationsof butyraldehyde have dealt with urban air in areas where smogs are a problem.This appears to be due to the presence of butyraldehyde in the emissionsfrom internal combustion engines and the involvement of butyraldehyde insmog formation. Grosjean et al. have conducted several of these studiesin Southern California (Ref. 17, Fung et al., 1981; Ref. 21, Grosjean,1982; Ref. 22, Grosjean et al., 1983; Ref. 23, Grosjean and Wright, 1983;and Ref. 24, Grosjean and Fung, 1984). Similar studies have been conductedin Sweden (Ref. 31, Jonsson et al., 1985). Isodorov (Ref. 28, 1985) reportedon the emissions of butyraldehyde into the atmosphere by ferns in the forestsof northern Russia. Little or no monitoring data were found on the presenceof butyraldehyde in the air near major manufacturing and use sites althoughtoxic release information reveals substantial fugitive emissions at manufacturingand use sites.Some monitoring studies have looked for butyraldehyde in surface, groundand drinking waters and it has been found at very low concentrations ina few samples (Ref. 11, Corwin, 1969; Ref. 16, Ewing et al., 1977; andRef. 58, Viar, 1988). No data were found on monitoring conducted on watersamples obtained near manufacturing and use sites.Ito et al. (Ref. 29, 1980) reported finding butyraldehyde in fish in Japan.<ITAG tagnum="81">II. Chemical Fate Information</ITAG>A. <T3>Transport. </T3>Based on its vapor pressure, water solubility and logP, butyraldehyde released to the environment will partition to both waterand air. The Henry's law constant for butyraldehyde indicates that butyraldehydein surface waters will volatilize rapidly with a half-life in water ofabout 12 hours.,B. <T3>Persistence. </T3>Butyraldehyde released to the environment will notpersist. It will be rapidly degraded in the atmosphere by reaction withhydroxyl radicals with an atmospheric half-life of 4 to 9 hours (Ref. 14,Eastman, 1988). Butyraldehyde is readily biodegraded under both aerobicand anaerobic conditions by acclimated microorganisms.C. <T3>Rationale for chemical fate recommendations.</T3> Butyraldehyde releasedto the environment will not persist and concerns for potential adverseeffects are low in most parts of the U.S. However, the large productionvolumes at sites in Texas and the toxic release data on substantial releasesto air at manufacturing and use site raise concerns with respect to environmentalconcentrations of butyraldehyde in air and water at those sites. Thoseemissions will occur on a nearly continuous basis and butyraldehyde maybe present in the air and water at significant concentrations that representa balance between rates of release and rates of removal by degradationprocesses. It is recommended that monitoring studies be conducted to determinebutyraldehyde concentrations in air and water in the vicinity of the majormanufacturing and use facilities. Monitoring for the presence of low molecularweight, volatile, hydrophilic compounds in water samples, as noted by Ogawaand Fritz (Ref. 43, 1985), can be very difficult and special care shouldbe taken to assure realistic results.<ITAG tagnum="81">III. </ITAG><T3>Biological Effects of Concern to Human Health</T3>A. <T3>Metabolism and pharmacokinetics.</T3> Aldehydes are oxidized to thecorresponding acid by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (Ref. 59, Weiner,1980) Three isozymes have been identified from human liver, all of whichoxidized several aldehydes, including butyraldehyde (Ref. 30, Jones andTeng, 1983).Butyraldehyde has been detected in mother's milk (6 or 8 samples) obtainedfrom urban areas in the U.S. (Ref. 45, Pellizzari et al., 1982) and inthe sera of normal and diabetic patients (Ref. 62, Zlatkis et al., 1980).<T3>In virto</T3> studies indicate that butyraldehyde at concentrationsof 0.1 to 1 mM inhibits multiplication of mouse sarcoma cells in culture(Ref. 46, Pilotti et al., 1975; Ref. 13, Curvall et al., 1984), and inhibitschemotaxis and reduces viability of human polymorphonuclear leukocytesat 90 mM (Ref. 3, Bridges et al., 1977). Other <T3>in vitro</T3> effects included: damage to the cell membranes of humanfibroblasts at 25 mM (Ref. 54, Thelestam et al., 1980; Ref. 13, Curvallet al., 1984) and human red blood cells at 1mM (Ref. 47, Poli et al., 1987),and interference with lipolysis and glucose metabolism in adipose tissuecells at concentrations of 1 to 20 mM (Ref. 20, Giudicelli et al., 1973).B. <T3>Acute and subchronic (short-term) effects.</T3> The acute toxicitydata for butyraldehyde are summarized in the following Table 3.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4>Toxicity of Butyraldehyde in Laboratory Animals</T4><H1>Species</H1><H1>LC50</H1><H2>Duration (hours)</H2><H2>Concentration (mg/m\3\)</H2><H1>LD50</H1><H2>Oral (mg/kg)</H2><H2>Dermal (mg/kg)</H2><H1>Reference</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Rat<D/><D/><D>2,490</D><D/><D>Marhold (1972, as cited in RTECS, Ref. 48).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rat<D>4</D><D/><T2>a</T2>a andgreater;23,590<D>5,890</D><D/><D>Smyth et al.

An RD50 of 1,532 ppm (4,518 mg/m3) was determinedfor B6C3F<T2>1</T2> mice, and an RD50 of 1,015 ppm (2,993 mg/m3) was determinedfor Swiss-Webster mice. An RD50 of 5,572 ppm (16,431 mg/m3) was determinedfor male rats under similar conditions (Ref. 1, Babiuk et al., 1985). Inhalation exposure of ten Sprague-Dawley derived CD rats to measured concentrationsof 1,820 ppm (5,367 mg/L) butyraldehyde for 4 hours caused irritation ofthe ocular and respiratory mucous membranes during the exposure and subsequent4 hours (Ref. 26, Hoechst-Celanese, 1988). No other treatment-related effectswere reported during the 14-day observation period or at necropsy. Inhalation exposure of rats to 1,000 ppm (2,949 mg/m3) butyraldehyde fortwelve 6-hour exposures produced no observable toxic signs (Ref. 18, Gage,1970. Oral administration of butyraldehyde to rats at dose levels of 0.075, 0.15,0.3, 0.6, or 1.2 g per kg, daily for 5 days per week for 13 weeks causedirritation, inflammation, necrosis, hyperplasia, and lesions in the forestomachand gastric mucosa (Ref. 40, NTP, 1988). The increased incidence of theselesions was dose-related and affected 100 percent of the males and 90 percentof females at the highest does level, 1.2 g/kg. Dermal exposure of rabbits to butyraldehyde (2.5 mL/kg) for 24 hours causedsevere dermal lesions that became infected and led to termination of thestudy after 7 days (Ref. 26, Hoechst-Celanese, 1988). Extensive necrosisand severe edema were exhibited by all animals at 24 hours; eschar developedabout day 4 or 5. Toxic signs evident in several animals during the 24-hourapplication period included ataxia, fine tremors, hypoactivity, and respiratoryanomalies. Tremors, hypoactivity, hypopnea and respiratory arhythmia persistedin a few aniamls for an unspecified period of time. Apart from the dermallesions, no other treatment-induced changes were evident at necropsy. Butyraldehyde is a severe skin and eye irritant in rabbits (Ref. 26, Hoechst-Celanese,1988). It exhibits little or no potential to produce dermal sensitizationin guinea pigs (Ref. 26, Hoechst-Celanese, 1981). After a 3-week inductionperiod consisting of nine 6-hour applications of butyraldehyde, there wasno dermal response from guinea pigs challenged with 10 percent butyraldehyde.A second challenge at 25 percent elicited an equivocal response in only2 of 20 animals. C. <T3>Genotoxicity. </T3>In the <T3>Salmonella </T3>assay, butyraldehyde was not mutagenic in strains TA1535,TA1537, TA98, or TA100, with or without activation (Ref. 35, Mortelmanset al., 1986). No increase in chromosomal aberrations was detected in Chinesehamster ovary cells at butyraldehyde concentrations of 59 to 135 ug/mLwith or without metabolic activation, but sister chromatid exchange wasinduced in these cells at nontoxic levels ranging from 9 to 90 ug/mL (Ref.19, Galloway et al., 1987). The lowest effective doses were less than 9ug/mL without activation and 30 ug/mL with activation. When butyraldehydewas administered to male mice (Q strain) in the drinking water at 0.2 mg/Lfor 50 days, chromosomal aberrations were evident as polyploidy at allstages of spermatogenesis and abnormal pairing of chromosomes at metaphaseI (Ref. 37, Moutschen-Dahmen, 1976). Butyraldehyde did not increase sisterchromatid exchange in human lymphocytes treated <T3>in vitro </T3>at a concentration of 2andmultiply;10^3 percent (v/v) withoutmetabolic activation (Ref. 42, Obe and Beck, 1979). No increase was reportedin sex-linked recessive lethals of <T3>Drosophila melanogaster </T3>fed butyraldehyde at a concentration of2,000 ppm in 5 percent aqueous sucrose (Ref. 57, Valencia et al., 1985).D. <T3>Oncogenicity. </T3>No information was found on the subject compound.Plans for a chronic inhalation bioassay of butyraldehyde were dropped byNTP because of technical difficulties in generating the atmosphere forexposure (Ref. 41, NTP, 1988). A related compound, isobutyraldehyde, isscheduled for a chronic inhalation bioassay starting in February 1989 underthe National Toxicology Program. Other structural analogues of n-butyraldehydeincluding formaldehyde and acetaldehyde have shown sufficient evidencefor carcinogenicity in animal studies; the evidence in humans is consideredby IARC to be limited for formaldehyde and inadequate for acetaldehyde(Ref. 27, IARC, 1987). E. <T3>Chronic (long-term) effects. </T3>No information was found. F. <T3>Reproducitve and developmental effects. </T3>A single intraperitonealinjection of 1 mg butyraldehyde per animal produced chromosomal damageand meiotic anomalies including degenerative nuclei, multispindle cellsand polyploid cells at all stages of spermatogenesis in male mice 1 monthfollowing the treatment (Ref. 36, Moutschen-Dahmen et al., 1975). In alater study (Ref. 37, Moutschen-Dahmen et al., 1976), one group of malemice received a single intraperitoneal dose of 30 mg butyraldehyde perkg, and a second group received 0.2 mg/L in their drinking water for 50days. Administration of butyraldehyde by either route damaged the spermatogeniccells of the seminiferous tubules. In addition to gross degeneration, polyploidywas observed at all stages of spermatogenesis and abnromal pairing of sexchromosomes occurred at metaphase I; there was increased incidence of spermatozoawithout acrosomes in the vas deferens. G. <T3>Observations in humans. </T3>Among 12 individuals of Oriental ancestrycharacterized as susceptible to cutaneous flushing after ingestion of ethanol,all reacted positively (with erythema) to patch testing with 75 percentbutyraldehyde (Ref. 60, Wilkin and Fortner, 1985).Butyraldehyde was found to be mildly irritating when applied in epicutaneoustests (Ref. 44, Fiser and Pokorny, 1965, as cited in Opdyke, 1979), whereas1 percent butyraldehyde in petrolatum produced no irritation after a 48-hourclosed patch test (Ref. 44, Kligman 1977, as cited in Opdyke, 1979). Oneout of 25 tested with 1 percent butyraldehyde in petrolatum had a positivebut nonspecific sensitization reaction in a maximization test. Butyraldehyde vapor (230 ppm) was nonirritating to the eyes of 15 men duringa 30 minute exposure (Ref. 49, Sim and Pattle, 1957). H. <T3>Rationale for health effects recommendations. </T3>Annual domesticproduction of n-butyraldehyde is about 1.8 billion pounds by five manufacturersat six sites in Texas. Preliminary data indicate that over 5,000 workers(including 950 women) were potentially exposed to n-butyraldehyde in theworkplace in 1980. Since domestic production has been increasing since1982, it is expected that more workers are exposed today. Sizeable airborne fugitive emissions have been reported (from 54,000 to836,000 lbs. per year) from six major manufacturing and use sites. Therefore,there is potential for significant community population exposure in thevicinity of manufacturing and use sites. Structural analogues of n-butyraldehyde including formaldehyde and acetaldehydehave shown carcinogenic effects in animals. IARC considers that there issufficient evidence from animal studies for the carcinogenicity of formaldehydeand acetaldehyde whereas the evidence in humans is limited or inadequate,respectively. The National Toxicology Program is scheduled to perform a2-year inhalation study with isobutyraldehyde. There are, however, no dataavailable to assess the carcinogenicity of n/butyraldehyde itself. TheCommittee noted the data indicating impaired spermatogenesis in male mice.Considering the lack of definitive data, the Committee recommends thattesting addressing carcinogenicity and reproductive and developmental effectsof butyraldehyde should be conducted if warranted by monitoring data. <ITAG tagnum="81">IV.

C. <T3>Other ecological effects. </T3>In a series of articles, Bringmann andKuhn reported on minimum inhibitory concentrations for a large number ofchemicals and a variety of aquatic organisms. The definition of minimuminhibitory concentration varied according to the organism being tested.For daphnids it was described as the maximum tested concentration at whichall of the daphnids were able to retain their swimming capability following24 hours exposure to the test chemical. For protozoa the minimum inhibitoryconcentration was the concentration that caused cell counts in test culturesto be 5 percent or more below the counts in control cultures with 48 hoursexposure. For algae, the minimum inhibitory concentration was the concentrationof test material that inhibited cell multiplication in test versus controlcultures during 8 days exposure. For the bacterium, <T3>Pseudomonas putida, </T3>the endpoint was inhibition of cell multiplicationafter 24 hours exposure, as determined by turbidity measurements of testversus control cultures (Ref. 4, Bringmann, 1978; Ref. 5, Bringmann andKuhn, 1980; Ref. 6, Bringmann and Kuhn, 1981; and Ref. 7, Bringmann andKuhn, 1982).

(Ref. 10, 1978) reported that butyraldehyde was relativelynon-toxic to methanogenic bacteria.In a study on the use of bacteria as an indication of toxicity to fish,Curtis et al. (Ref. 12, 1981) reported a 5-minute EC50 of 16.4 mg/L for<T3>Photobacterium phosphoreum </T3>exposed to butyraldehyde.D. <T3>Bioconcentration and food-chain transport. </T3>An examination of fishin Japan revealed the presence of butyraldehyde at low concentrations (Ref.29, Ito et al., 1980). The significance of this information in unclearsince butyraldehyde is produced naturally and is found in many food products.Based on its high water solubility and low octanol/water partitioning coefficient,butyraldehyde is not expected to bioconcentrate.E. <T3>Rationale for ecological effects recommendations. </T3>Butyraldehydeis produced in very large annual quantities at several locations in Texas.There are reports of substantial emissions of butyraldehyde to air at manufacturingand use sites. There may be significant concentrations of butyraldehydein the air and surface waters in the vicinity of one or more of the manufacturingand use sites. Few data are available on the acute toxicity of butyraldehydeto aquatic species and none were found for terrestrial plants and animals.No chronic toxicity information was found. It is recommended that appropriatetoxicity studies be conducted with representative species of biota if warrantedby monitoring data.<ITAG tagnum="74">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Babiuk, C., Steinhagen, W.H., and Barow, C.S. ``Sensory irritationresponse to inhaled aldehydes after formaldehyde pretreatment.'' <T3>Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology. </T3>79:143-149 (1985).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Brabec, M.J. ``Aldehydes and acetals.'' in G.D.
