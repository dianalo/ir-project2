South African soldiers protecting a dam killed more than 300Angolan and Cuban troops who launched a land and air attack Monday,South African military headquarters said. It said 12 South Africanswere killed.   The 12 deaths were the country's highest fatality count in asingle battle in Angola during the past year. Col. John Rolt of theSouth African Defense Force described the battle as one of thebiggest South African-Cuban clashes since Cuban troops arrived in1975 to support Angola's Marxist government.   The battle occurred at a dam outside Calueque, about 30 milesnorth of the border with South-West Africa, the territoryadministered by South Africa.   The South African military said 11 of its soldiers were killedby a bomb dropped from a Soviet-made MiG fighter plane. The 12thsoldier was killed in the ground skirmish that left 300 Cubans andAngolans dead, the military said.   South Africa has long protected the dam, which supplies water toSouth-West Africa, also known as Namibia. The dam wall was damaged,electricity to the wall was cut off and a water pipeline wasdestroyed, the military said.   Botha said the attack ``confirms Cuba's aggressive intentions,''adding that additional raids could undermine ongoing peace talks.   South Africa, Angola, Cuba and the United States have held threerounds of peace talks since May, including discussions thatconcluded last weekend in Cairo, Egypt. A fourth round is schedulednext month in the United States.   The talks have focused on withdrawing all foreign troops fromAngola and bringing independence to Namibia. The talks have notproduced any concrete results, but all sides have described themeetings as productive.   ``I cannot at this stage predict how the events at Calueque willaffect the further course of the discussions,'' Botha said in astatement released early today. ``However, should this trendcontinue, it will serve no purpose to hold further discussions.''   Botha said South African protection of the Calueque dam wasdiscussed in May at peace talks in Brazzaville, Congo.   ``The impression was left that (Angola) understood the positionand would ensure that ... Calueque would not become the scene ofmilitary intervention by the Cubans,'' Botha said.   ``The clash at Calueque confirms the South African government'ssuspicion that the Cuban command in Angola ignores the Angolangovernment ... and possibly also the (Cuban) politicalrepresentatives who participated in the discussions,'' Botha added.   South Africa has said that during the past year it has had up to3,000 troops in Angola supporting the National Union for the TotalIndependence of Angola (UNITA), a pro-Western rebel movement.UNITA, which also receives military aid from the United States, hasbeen fighting since 1975 for a power-sharing agreement.   Angola claims there are 9,000 South African troops inside itsborders. The Angolan government, meanwhile, is backed by more than40,000 Cuban troops and an estimated 1,000 Soviet advisers.   In recent weeks, South Africa and UNITA said the Cubans andAngolans had moved at least 15,000 fresh troops to southern Angola,along the border with Namibia. The Angolans said the troopmovements were to match South African activity in the area.   South Africa traditionally has crossed into Angola fromSouth-West Africa in pursuit of guerrillas of the South-WestAfrican People's Organization.   The guerrilla group has been fighting for 21 years to end SouthAfrican control of the territory. The rebels often launch theirperiodic raids from bases in southern Angola.</TEXT></DOC>
