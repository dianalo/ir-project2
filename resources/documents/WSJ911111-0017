Price's U.S. firm is&quot;using its separate partnership structure as a shield to hidebehind its own culpability in the BCCI mess,&quot; Mr. Lerachcharges.   Other defendants in the class-action suit include Ernst andamp;Young -- the successor firm to Ernst andamp; Whinney, which wasBCCI's auditor before Price Waterhouse -- and a bevy of BCCIofficials, associates and government officials involved withthe bank.   BCCI was seized and closed by international bankingregulators in July after a private report requested underBritish law by the Bank of England and compiled by Price'sBritish firm showed that the bank was rife with fraud,cover-ups and subterfuges.   In the lawsuit, filed on behalf of BCCI's 1.2 milliondepositors world-wide, including several thousand U.S.citizens, plaintiffs are seeking multibillion-dollar tripledamages under the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations Act.   Erica Baird, assistant general counsel for Price's U.S.firm, said that Price &quot;doesn't believe that there is anymerit in the claims&quot; against the U.S. firm.   Arthur Siegel, vice chairman of Price's U.S. firm, saidthat Price is a &quot;world-wide organization and not a world-widefirm.&quot; He compared the affiliates to members of a family, whomay have the same names but have differing responsibilitiesand reputations. As to the charges of shoddy work andpossible fraud involving the world-wide audit of BCCI led byPrice's British firm, Mr. Siegel said: &quot;When there is aconspiracy by management in collusion with outsiders from thebank to commit fraud, it is difficult if not impossible tocatch by the outside auditor.&quot;   A spokesman for Ernst andamp; Young in New York said that &quot;wehad a limited role with BCCI which ended after the 1986 auditwhen we voluntarily resigned.&quot; He declined to comment on thelawsuit.   Ms. Baird said that Price's U.S. firm was paid $2 millionto $2.5 million in 1988 for helping to develop and performnew &quot;compliance procedures&quot; for BCCI offices in Miami, NewYork, San Francisco and Los Angeles.   &quot;This was to assure that situations giving rise to anindictment couldn't occur again,&quot; she said. In 1988, BCCI wasindicted in federal court in Tampa, Fla., on drug-moneylaundering charges involving the since-ousted Panamanianleader Manuel Noriega. BCCI last year pleaded guilty to thecharges and agreed to pay $14.8 million to the government.   Ms. Baird also said that Price's U.S. firm was paid atotal of $1.5 million for &quot;limited-scope audits&quot; of BCCI'sfour U.S. offices for the five years beginning in 1987. TheU.S. firm didn't issue public reports but sent the audits toPrice's British firm, she added.   From 1982 through 1986, Price's U.S. firm also receivedabout $500,000 in fees for accounting and auditing work forBCCI in Florida, Ms. Baird noted.   Some leading accountants say that the BCCI scandal willhurt Price's reputation despite the assertion that its U.S.firm is separate from its British firm.   John C. Burton, a former chief accountant of theSecurities and Exchange Commission, says that &quot;PriceWaterhouse holds itself out to practice under one nameworld-wide&quot; so that the BCCI scandal &quot;does affect itsreputation {and} professional deficiencies&quot; in the U.S. andelsewhere. But its legal liabilities &quot;will have to bedetermined by the courts,&quot; said Mr. Burton, who is now anaccounting professor at Columbia University's Graduate Schoolof Business in New York.   Douglas Carmichael, an accounting professor at the CityUniversity of New York's Baruch College, said the claim ofPrice's U.S. firm that it is separate from its Britishaffiliate is &quot;a distinction without a difference.&quot; Adds Mr.Carmichael: &quot;Price Waterhouse is a world-wide firm and has tostand behind its reputation everywhere in the world.&quot;   In New York, Price officials have said British banksecrecy rules prevent the firm from disclosing more about itsrole as world-wide auditor of BCCI from 1987 on. And Priceofficials have said it was not improper under Britishauditing standards for Price's British firm to give BCCI'sfinancial statements clean opinions publicly while informingthe Bank of England in several private reports about themassive fraud pervading the bank, because BCCI's capital wasguaranteed by the oil-rich nation of Abu Dhabi.   But Mr. Carmichael, former vice president, auditing, ofthe American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, says,&quot;I can't see how any set of auditing standards anywhere wouldpermit Price to issue a clean opinion without disclosing thebank's problems publicly.&quot;   Separately, the U.S. attorney's office in Miami said afederal grand jury indicted Jaime Gaviria, a BCCI customer,alleging that he filed false income tax returns for 1987 and1988. Mr. Gaviria, a Colombian who became a U.S. citizen inearly 1987, had about $2.2 million on deposit with BCCI in1987 and 1988, according to a statement issued by the U.S.attorney in Miami. Mr. Gaviria couldn't be reached forcomment.</TEXT></DOC>
