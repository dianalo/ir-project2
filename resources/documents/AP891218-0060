Fierce fighting broke out on the streets around campuses afterIm Chong-suk, 23, and five student bodyguards were overpowered andarrested by 20 plainclothes police at a Seoul university earlier inthe day.   Police said there had been arrests in the clashes but had nofigures. At least one student suffered serious burns in a clash atSeoul's Hanyang University and was hospitalized.   Im has been on the police wanted list since March with a rewardequivalent to $7,400 offered for information leading to his arrest.He is head of the outlawed National Council of StudentRepresentatives, or Chondaehyop.   Police said Im would be charged with violations of the NationalSecurity Law governing sedition and communist activity. Im toldreporters at police headquarters he had planned to discuss Koreanunification in a scheduled television interview when he wasapprehended. The interview was not held.   The most serious fighting of the day was reported in thesouthern city of Kwangju, where about 800 students, hurlinghundreds of firebombs, battled police for two hours around ChosunUniversity.   ``Release Im Chong-suk!'' the state television, KBS, quotedstudents as shouting as they charged about 1,000 riot police.   KBS showed scenes of columns of protesters with masks andhankerchiefs over their faces attacking police, who fired tear gas.   The tear gas drifted onto the Kwangju campuses of four middleand high schools in the area, forcing them to temporarily suspendclasses, KBS said.   About 400 students fought riot police with firebombs and rocksfor an hour in front of the main gates of Hanyang University, whereIm is a senior. Police hurled rocks back at the students.   In the southern port city of Pusan, groups of up to 20 studentsstormed six regional offices of an opposition party, demanding Im'srelease and protesting a compromise Saturday between ruling andopposition parties aimed at ending the long dispute over corruptionand misdeeds under former President Chun Doo-hwan. Students wantChun arrested and punished.   Meanwhile, police detained about 120 students who staged streetdemonstrations near a courthouse where a woman student and aCatholic priest are on trial for making illegal trips to CommunistNorth Korea.   ``Free the flower of unification!'' and ``Abolish nationalsecurity laws!'' the students shouted as they were loaded intopolice buses. Most were released later with warnings, police said.   Inside the courtroom, Im Su-kyong, 20, was in the fourth day ofher trial on charges of violating the National Security Law forvisiting North Korea without government authorization.   The two Ims are unrelated.</TEXT></DOC>
