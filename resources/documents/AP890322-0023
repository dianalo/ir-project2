As recently as last November, the General Accounting Office andRep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., the chairman of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, publicly lauded the Trident 2 missile as the one majorstrategic weapon that was proceeding on schedule, under ``sound''management and within budget.   And unlike the B-1B and B-2 bombers and the MX and Midgetmanmissiles, the Trident 2 has been embraced by Congress as a necessaryimprovement to the nation's nuclear arsenal.   While land-based missiles and bombers are susceptible to afirst-strike attack, the Navy's nuclear submarines are stillconsidered immune to Soviet detection and thus always ready toretaliate in the event of war.   The Trident 2 is a new, more lethal version of the weapon thatnow forms the heart of America's naval nuclear deterrent. TheTrident I missile went into service in 1979, offering a much greaterrange than its predecessor, the Poseidon missile.   That range of roughly 4,600 miles, in turn, allowed U.S. nuclearsubmarines to patrol a vast area of the world's oceans and stillremain close enough to strike the Soviet Union, improving an alreadyformidable underwater advantage.   The Trident 2 is designed to offer something more: not onlygreater range _ roughly 6,000 miles _ but more importantly, greateraccuracy. For the first time, say defense sources, the mostinvulnerable part of the U.S. nuclear arsenal also will be accurateenough to threaten targets the Soviet Union has ``hardened'' tosurvive a war.   Although accuracy figures for all nuclear missiles areclassified, published reports suggest the Trident 2 is designed tostrike within 400 feet or less of a target, compared to about 1,500feet for the Trident I.   That almost matches the predicted accuracy of the land-based MXmissile and is considered sufficient to destroy hardened targets.Some critics claim that will turn submarines into ``first strike''weapons, undermining the deterrent balance with the Soviet Union.   Pentagon officials counter that absent any arms control agreementdealing with submarine weapons, the Trident 2 is needed because itis the Soviets who have built the largest arsenal of first-strikeweapons.   Despite two previous failures in the first 19 tests of theTrident 2, Navy officials have expressed pleasure over the generalprogress in developing the missile.   On Tuesday, the service said in a statement it was``disappointed'' with the latest failure, but added: ``It is throughthis type of developmental test program that you iron out problems.''   The Navy said it is still planning to conduct eight moresea-based test launches and that it is premature to suggest themissile wouldn't be ready for its scheduled first deployment inDecember 1989.   The Trident I missile that now forms the heart of the Navy'snuclear arsenal experienced similar test failures and but wasdeployed on schedule, the service added.</TEXT></DOC>
