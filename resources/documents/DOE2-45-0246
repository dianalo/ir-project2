Constitution: Means for detectingthe failure of LRRMs and inserting TIP to that position and means forcalculating the power distribution in the reactor core based on outputsignals from TIP are disposed. Power distribution is calculated as usualif no failure is detected. However, if the failure is detected, countedpower distribution is calculated by using counted values from TIP insteadthereof. In this way, even if several of LRRMs happen to be failed, powerdistribution can be determined at such a high accuracy as in the normaloperation. Further, it is also possible to exactly evaluate the fuelintegrity and recognize the reactor core state, to thereby exactly monitorthe reactor core. (Horiuchi, T.).</TEXT></DOC>
