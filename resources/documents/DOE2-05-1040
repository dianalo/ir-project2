The sediments are groupedinto three genetic facies associations (A, B, C) reflecting two stylesof channel flow (A and B) and overbank sheet flow (C). The sedimentsare dominated by plane-bed lamination, including low-angle cross-beds(28%) and large-scale cross-bedding (27%) in association with small-scalecross-bedding (17%), massive bedding (14%) and intraformational conglomerates(5%). Mud and siltstones form only 10% of the depostis. Anhydrite (formergypsum) is associated with fine grained deposits, mainly of overbankorigin and is commonly observed in intraformational clasts in the channeldeposits. The inferred ephemeral stream complex probably formed a linkbetween a more permanent braided stream system towards the north (theSkagerrak Fm.) and a sabkha system towards south (the Middle Buntsandsteinin northern Germany). 26 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
