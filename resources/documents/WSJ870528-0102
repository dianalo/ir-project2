An even better move is raising the left eyebrow while taking off the glasses.&quot;    And perhaps the best move is getting paid for such gestures. For Mr. Altman is an actor, one of many across the country whose specialty is portraying business executives. Whether it's hawking personal computers for 30 seconds on television or starring in a corporate training film, their performances require a keen eye for business rituals and procedures -- although simply looking good in a pin-stripe suit is often enough.    In one respect, these aren't the best of times for actors who specialize in executive roles. Much work has been stolen by hams who are real CEOs -- like Chrysler Corp.'s Lee Iacocca and Remington Products Inc.'s Victor Kiam, who tout their companies' products.    Moreover, as acting roles go, portraying a banker or insurance salesman isn't exactly Hamlet. Only one of Advertising Age magazine's best commercials of 1986 features an actor as a businessman -- unless, of course, you count Messrs. Bartles andamp; Jaymes, the wine-cooler duo, or the Continental Illinois Bank loan officer who proffers a loan application but ends up doing a hula-hoop routine.    &quot;On a scale of one to 10 for dramatic stimulation, playing a businessman is maybe a three,&quot; says Mr. Altman. &quot;But then how many business people do you know who are all that stimulating?&quot;    Still, while perhaps not serious drama, an executive role can pay well and holds out the promise of a repeat performance. &quot;I started out as an earnest young salesman type,&quot; says Mr. Altman, who is 43 and also works as a drama teacher in Pittsburgh. &quot;I'm working toward upper management now. My curmudgeonhood is on the horizon. I could play chairmen! I can go all the way to the old executives' home.&quot;    Then there is the actor who simply enjoys his work. &quot;I find it rather easy to portray a businessman,&quot; says John Cleese, the English comedian who has played dozens of executives in industrial training films produced by a company he co-founded. &quot;Being bland, rather cruel and incompetent comes naturally to me, for some reason.&quot;    Commercials suggest that business executives lead a pretty good life. Rather than argue about, say, profit forecasts, they focus on the really important things. Like who has the longest town car. And after sprinting for planes and just making the flight, their pillows are constantly plumped by smiling flight attendants. Stewardesses even help put together their business deals, as one recent airline commercial showed.    But what does it take to land such roles? Actors and casting directors say it never hurts to look good in a Brooks Brothers suit and to show a dash of gray at the temple. A closetful of suspenders, horned-rim glasses and yellow power ties helps.    &quot;Look well-fed. Resembling a fat cat helps,&quot; says Lee Cass, a New York actor who has played everything from a sales manager for Panasonic to an irate machine-shop owner in a Xerox training film. He sometimes patterns his performances after Mr. Iacocca, who looks very well fed.    &quot;Know some business buzzwords,&quot; says Jim York, a New York actor who during the past two decades has played suave business types for everyone from General Motors to Oil of Olay. &quot;Bottom line. High tech. Hardware. Software. It's not too tough.&quot;    Others say they simply play themselves. &quot;I'm attractive and clean-cut looking, and I have a deep resonant voice,&quot; says Douglas Ballard, a New York actor. &quot;You know, pretty common business qualities.&quot;    For the actress aspiring to portray a businesswoman, a proper understanding of clothing is a must. Susan Chapek, who works in commercials and industrial films, places her roles in three categories: &quot;the killer female,&quot; who wears an electric blue, strictly tailored, Evan Picone tweed; the &quot;motherly&quot; businesswoman, possibly a secretary who moved up through the ranks, who wears a bow at the neck, which has become &quot;the female equivalent of a brown suit&quot;; and the loser, who wears polyester, the more poorly tailored the better.    Perfecting the role of an executive requires a few tricks of the trade. Mr. Altman uses what he calls his &quot;little catalog&quot; of moves: hiding behind the desk, leaning back in the chair and rolling it in and out, leaning over the desk. &quot;It's hard work,&quot; he professes. Mr. Ballard prefers a more cerebral approach. &quot;Looking off into the distance works,&quot; he says, contending it makes him look pensive and sincere.    Achieving the proper balance of blandness and assertiveness that is considered the hallmark of executives in TV spots isn't always a snap. &quot;It took me almost five years to learn how to be sincere,&quot; says Mr. York. His secret: &quot;I pretend I'm talking to my mother.&quot; If that doesn't work, he adds, he pretends he is Ronald Reagan.    Mr. York reckons his best performance was an ATandamp;T commercial in which he portrayed a busy computer manager helping a big airline save money. &quot;There was a real sense of urgency about me,&quot; he explains. Such roles are so popular that they are some actors' speciality. &quot;I always do the desperate, on-the-edge kind of businessman,&quot; says James Rebhorn of New York, who recently starred as an edgy newspaper publisher in one of ATandamp;T's &quot;wandering camera&quot; spots. &quot;I guess I have some inherent desperation.&quot;    Casting actors as executives apparently requires an eye for the mundane. Mr. Cleese populates his training films with a familiar menagerie of business people. &quot;There's the engineer who's rather stuffy and more at home with machines than people,&quot; he says. &quot;There's the accountant who sits there reading the Financial Times looking slightly pained. He's not listening very carefully to what anybody's saying because in a minute he's going to put the paper down and say, 'We can't do that.'&quot;    Casting was especially important in Wang Laboratories Inc.'s new ad campaign, which features computer salesmen telling war stories in dense technical jargon. &quot;When we saw the first casting tape, the actors were pretty green,&quot; says Anne Finucane, a senior vice president of Hill, Holiday, Connors, Cosmopolous Inc., the Boston-based ad agency that came up with the ads.    The actors kept stumbling over computerese like VS systems, MIS types and conductivity. &quot;DEC (short for Digital Equipment Corp. and pronounced &quot;deck&quot;) always got them,&quot; Ms. Finucane says. &quot;They always said 'D.E.C.,' which sounds like some kind of gynecological exam.&quot;    Not every would-be executive works out. Mr. Cleese says he once axed a popular English actor for a part in one of his training films after test audiences refused to believe he was a businessman.    &quot;Maybe he looked too intelligent,&quot; he muses. </TEXT></DOC>
