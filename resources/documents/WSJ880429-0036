But just as clearly, the ministers are deeply divided over how to implement any production-cutting strategy to prop up oil prices. Indeed, it appeared possible yesterday that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might have to settle at best for a symbolic gesture of cooperation with non-OPEC oil exporters.    &quot;In terms of real production, we are talking about just a temporary cut, at least for this trial period, to see how the market reacts,&quot; said Fernando Santos-Avite, Ecuador's oil minister.    Mr. Santos-Avite and other OPEC ministers began deliberations late last night on a proposal to coordinate production cuts with several nonmember oil-exporting nations. At joint meetings earlier this week, seven producing countries outside the 13-nation cartel offered to trim their oil exports for May and June by 5%, a total of nearly 200,000 barrels a day, if OPEC would follow with proportionate cuts totaling about 700,000 barrels a day.    Although OPEC actions have taken surprising turns in the past, it seemed clear late last night that any output cuts by the two groups, which together account for half the non-Communist world's oil supplies, would total considerably less than the 900,000 barrels a day recommended by the non-OPEC exporters. At the most, according to OPEC sources, the combined reductions, if they occur at all, would total less than 500,000 barrels a day, or slightly less than 1% of the world's oil output.    The OPEC ministers ended their first session early this morning after long discussions on world oil supply and demand and will meet again tonight. &quot;Let's first get our house in order -- then we'll see if we actually need production cuts,&quot; said Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister.    A modest counteroffer probably wouldn't satisfy the seven non-OPEC participants in this week's talks. They are Mexico, China, Angola, Egypt, Colombia, Oman and Malaysia. Brunei also would be a party to the agreement, non-OPEC strategists said, although it didn't have representatives here.    But some of the non-OPEC exporters have suggested their willingness to be flexible. &quot;We expect them to cut 5%, but we cannot insist that OPEC do things it cannot do,&quot; Giang Yunlong, a senior oil official from China, said in an interview.    The cultural, political and economic diversity of OPEC -- two of whose members, Iraq and Iran, are at war, for example -- assured varied responses to the historic proposal from the non-OPEC group. &quot;There are 13 members; they all have their own ideas,&quot; Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's new oil minister, said in an interview.    Some Persian Gulf members insist that OPEC minimize production cuts because its share of world oil output has dropped sharply in recent years. Others endorse the non-OPEC plan. Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, has been insisting that any reductions in the cartel's output be borne by those members whose production exceeds the cartel's self-imposed ceiling.    There have been reports here that Saudi Arabia, in the interest of unanimity, might modify its position. Asked about that at last night's opening of the OPEC ministerial meeting, Hisham M. Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, replied: &quot;I never stated we had a position.&quot; Also asked if the kingdom would be willing to cut its own production below its OPEC quota of 4.3 million barrels a day, the Saudi minister answered: &quot;We'll see.&quot;    Belkacem Nabi, Algeria's oil minister and a strong supporter of major production cuts by OPEC as well as by outside producers, called the non-OPEC offer &quot;a very positive proposal.&quot; Asked, however, if it was just a starting point for negotiations between OPEC and the non-OPEC group, he nodded affirmatively.    Most of the OPEC ministers object to cuts involving a percentage of exports, partly because OPEC exports three-fourths of the oil it produces while the seven non-OPEC nations export only about half of theirs. Yet Iran objects to any counteroffer involving equal, barrel-for-barrel cuts by the OPEC and non-OPEC groups because OPEC's production is far larger. That would be &quot;a very limited effort and would be discouraging to the non-OPEC producers,&quot; Kazempour Ardabili, Iran's deputy oil minister, said in an interview. </TEXT></DOC>
