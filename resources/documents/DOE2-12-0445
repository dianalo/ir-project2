We findthat higher-order processes, which can be phenomenologically relevantfor sufficiently long lived systems, can result in coincident narrowpeaks even for subcritical systems. The Z dependence of the energy ofthe peaks can be much softer than that predicted for positrons from ''sparking''of the vacuum. Our results may be relevant to peaks which have been observedat the Gesellschaft fuer Schwerionenforschung (GSI).</TEXT></DOC>
