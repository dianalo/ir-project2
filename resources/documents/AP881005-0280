The report to the U.N.-sponsored Convention on Long-RangeTransboundary Air Pollution said the extent of the damage could bemuch worse, since the research was mainly based on informationprovided by the countries concerned.   ``In some cases, it is too late to do anything,'' said KaarleKenttamies, head of the Finnish Environment Ministry team whichconducted the survey commissioned by the Nordic Council ofMinisters.   ``In other countries, particularly the peripheral regions suchas Scandinavia and southernmost Europe, there is still hope,''Kenttamies said.   ``But many small lakes and rivers, especially in central Europe,are dead and only a 100 percent drop in sulphur emissions can savethem,'' he said. Dumping a heavy dose of lime also helps reduceacidity, he said.   The year-long research showed nearly all smaller bodies of waterin central Europe can no longer be used as sources of drinkingwater, Kenttamies said.   The conference, which drew participants from the United States,the Soviet Union and nine west European nations, urged the EconomicCommission for Europe to adopt stricter measures to fight pollutioncaused by nitrogen and sulphur emissions.   ECE-member countries have decided to start a joint transboundarypollution monitoring project in 1989 to study environmental changescaused by acid rain.   The research is aimed at an in-depth study and classification ofdata as well as creating an integrated monitoring system onacidification across Europe and northern America.   ``Despite certain opposition to such research, particularly inthe United States and Great Britain, we can safely say thatacidification is one of the worst pollution problems of the1980s,'' Kenttamies said.   Kenttamies rejected as ``nonsense'' the argument that noconclusive evidence exists that fossil fuel-fired power stationsare a main contributor to acid rain.   ``Whatever people say, I've seen enough reports and been toenough conventions like the one here today to know that we havesuch conclusive evidence,'' he said.   The high cost of fighting acid rain is a problem for countrieswhich rely heavily on fossil fuels. Britain and Poland, both heavycoal users, are the only European nations which refused to join the``Thirty Percent Club'' whose aim is to reduce 1980-level sulphuremissions 30 percent by 1993.   Acid rain in Scandinavia, mostly from industrial centers ineastern and western europe, also has contaminated lakes and forests.   Finns were recently shocked to learn of heavy pollution in whathad been considered virgin Lapland in northern Finland caused bymassive Soviet copper and nickel works from industries in the KolaPeninsula, according to reports.   A joint commission, currently meeting in Yalta, was set up bythe Finns and the Russians to study cross-border pollution, whichis threatening the livelihood of northern Finns dependent onreindeer husbandry.</TEXT></DOC>
