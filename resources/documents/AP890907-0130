Michel Aoun said Thursday that U.S.foreign policy is ``biased and shortsighted,'' then asked Americanhelp in what the Christian leader calls the war of liberationagainst Syrian troops in Lebanon. Aoun said the U.S. withdrawal ofits last diplomats Wednesday was based on ``rumors, falsesuppositions and unconvincing reasons.''   He likened the 6-month-old battle between his 20,000 Christiansoldiers and a Moslem alliance led by the 40,000 Syrians to whatAmericans' ``forefathers did ... 200 years ago'' in theRevolutionary War.   Syrians and Christians exchanged artillery fire for five hoursbefore dawn Thursday and police reported two dead and seven wounded.At least 830 people have been killed and 2,462 wounded since theartillery war began March 8. Nearly all the victims have beencivilians.   The U.S.-trained general said he would welcome the return ofAmbassador John McCarthy and other American diplomats to Lebanononly if Washington recognized his Christian Cabinet as thelegitimate government.   His government competes for power with a Moslem Cabinet led byacting Premier Salim Hoss. McCarthy, who had been in Lebanon sincethe rival regimes were created a year ago, avoided taking sides bynot presenting his credentials to either.   U.S. military helicopters evacuated the 30 remaining Americansfrom the U.S. Embassy compound in east Beirut on Wednesday morning.   ``It is pitiful that American-Lebanese relations shoulddeteriorate to that point due to the stubbornness of the AmericanEmbassy ... backed by a biased and shortsighted foreign policy,''Aoun said.   He was clearly angered by the State Department's declarationWednesday that it evacuated the U.S. diplomats because Aounthreatened to expose them to a ``good dose of Christian terrorism.''   Speaking to reporters in his bunker under the shatteredpresidential palace in Baabda, east of Beirut, the 54-year-oldMaronite Catholic general urged the ``American people and theirelected representatives to ignore their State Department's policy.''   Americans should ``support all the Lebanese, Moslems andChristians, in our war of liberation'' against the Syrians, he said.   Syrian soldiers are in Lebanon under a peacekeeping mandate theArab League issued in 1976, the year after the sectarian civil warbegan. At least 150,000 Lebanese have been killed in the war.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Wednesdaythat a leader of Christian youths who massed outside the embassybefore the evacuation told diplomats they could move in and out ofthe compound only ``at their own risk.''   Aoun said her remarks were ``a calculated but crude personalattack on me.''   ``It is an attack perhaps born of desperation rather thanexasperation at the continued Lebanese resistance, and based at beston half truth, hearsay and downright black propaganda, at which weall know the State Department excels,'' he told journalists.   Ms. Tutwiler quoted Aoun as saying in an interview with theFrench newspaper Figaro that ``perhaps he should take 20 Americanhostages.''   In the interview published Sept. 1, Aoun was asked whether theUnited States was putting pressure on France not to aid him, andreplied in part:   ``They put pressure on everyone and claim in addition to have soacted because they have 10 hostages being held in Lebanon. As if thewar were being waged without hostages or victims. If I understandwell, it would be enough that tomorrow I take 20 Americans hostageso that the United States stops putting pressure on my friends.''   Eight Americans are among the 16 Western captives in Lebanon.   After Aoun's news conference Thursday, Ms. Tutwiler repeated herfeeling about the remark to Figaro: ``I view it as a threat.''   Aoun was not asked about it during the news conference.   The general said he had assigned his ``best officers andsoldiers'' to protect the embassy and American diplomats. He saidthe decision to evacuate them was ``unjustified ... because therehave never been any victims or any hostage-taking in this region atall since the current events started.''   His reference was to the 310-square-mile enclave north and eastof Beirut in which an estimated 1 million Christians live. It hasbeen sealed off by the Syrians and their Moslem allies.</TEXT></DOC>
