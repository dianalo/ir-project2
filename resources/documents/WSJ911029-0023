Separately, Boeing posted a 6.1% rise in third-quarterearnings on a 6.7% increase in sales.</LP><TEXT>   Net income climbed to $401 million, or $1.17 a share, from$378 million, or $1.10 a share. Sales increased to $7.66billion from $7.18 billion. The results slightly topped theconsensus among Wall Street analysts, who had been lookingfor Boeing to earn $1.15 a share, according to Zack'sInvestment Research.   The company attributed the improved profit to highercommercial aircraft sales, lower operating losses in itsdefense and space business and a lower effective federal taxrate. Those factors were partially offset by higher researchand development expense, principally for the 777 program.   JAL selected the new Boeing models -- 10 as firm orders,10 as options -- over McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s MD-12 and astretched version of Airbus Industrie's A330.   &quot;We had to make a decision on a new model within thisyear, and the other two aircraft haven't yet reached officialcustomer-launch status,&quot; said a spokesman for Japan's No. 1airline. The 777s are scheduled to be delivered between 1995and 1999.   In late trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange,Boeing shares were quoted at $49.375, up 75 cents.   Paul Nisbet, of Prudential Securities, said the timing ofBoeing's news couldn't have been better. He said it offsetMcDonnell Douglas's decision Friday to begin formallyoffering the airlines the MD-12 -- a direct challenge toBoeing's 747 jumbo jet. Had it not been for the JAL buy andthe &quot;solid earnings,&quot; Mr. Nisbet said, &quot;Boeing's stock wouldhave been much weaker.&quot;   In its earnings report, Boeing said requests by airlinesto reschedule jet deliveries as a result of the economicslowdown &quot;continue to affect a relatively small number ofaircraft.&quot; Although no firm orders for jets have beencanceled, Boeing said, several carriers have told the companythat they do not plan to exercise some of their options.   So far this year, Boeing has received firm orders for 194planes valued at $15.5 billion. Last year at this time,Boeing had won orders for 413 aircraft valued at $38.4billion. The JAL 777s aren't included in the latest figuresbecause the transaction hasn't closed yet.   Still, the JAL announcement gives Boeing some addedmomentum, coming two months after British Airways PLC orderedup to 30 777s valued at $3.6 billion. Until then, orders forthe twin-engine plane, launched last year, had been slow.   JAL doesn't have to decide on the accompanying engineorder -- valued at roughly $375 million -- until the end ofnext year. The contenders are General Electric Co., UnitedTechnologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitney unit and Rolls-RoycePLC.   Boeing is also working closely with Japan's top threeaircraft manufacturers to build the 777. But the JALspokesman denied the frequent speculation that the close workwith Japanese companies affected the airline's decision toorder the planes.   JAL will use the new Boeing planes for domestic and Asianroutes. Most of the planes will be used to expand thecompany's fleet, currently 105 aircraft. The order caps anambitious purchasing plan by JAL, and is the company's lastplanned purchase for a while, the spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
