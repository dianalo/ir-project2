Cook County Circuit Judge Anthony Scotillo on Monday said UnityCatholic High School was reasonably enforcing its policy and wascausing no irreparable harm.   Scotillo denied a request for a temporary restraining order fromCarla Minniefield Jenkins, 18.   ``I feel discriminated against,'' Mrs. Jenkins said. ``I toldthem I was pregnant in January. I participated in senioractivities, but they didn't tell me until March 31 that if you'repregnant your senior year you cannot go to graduation.''   Principal Lawrence Keller said she would be allowed to graduate,but would receive her diploma at home.   ``Our goal is to support her in going to full term in herpregnancy,'' Keller said. ``But we decided that we could notcondone premarital sex or teen-age marriage. It's as simple asthat.''   Mrs. Jenkins, who is five months pregnant, was married lastmonth to Richard Jenkins, 19. His father, attorney Robert Jenkins,filed the court request.   ``I can understand them not condoning premarital sex, but sometime we're going to have to learn to live with the good and thebad,'' the elder Jenkins said.   In the South Side school's 66-year history, officials have neverknowingly allowed a pregnant student to participate in thegraduation program, Keller said.</TEXT></DOC>
