The proposal values the remaining stake at about $80.9 million and the whole company at $137 million.    Trading was halted in National Guardian shares on the national over-the-counter market yesterday at $7.25, up 12.5 cents.    A unit of LEP Group PLC, London, owns about 41% of National Guardian's 10 million common shares. LEP has interests in international freight forwarding, insurance and travel agencies.    The proposed acquisition wouldn't result in a management change, National Guardian said. Discussions haven't been concluded, the company added. </TEXT></DOC>
