 InCzechoslovakia, the daily Lidove Noviny is the symbol of these changes.andP;  In1988, the paper started to come out as a typed monthly magazine with acirculation of no more than several hundred copies.andP;  Several prominentdissidents, today members of the government or members of Parliament, stoodat the cradle of this venture.andP;  After the November revolution, there were nofurther grounds for its illegal publication, and so, in January 1990, LidoveNoviny began to be published, at first twice a week, but since April 1990, itis published as a daily newspaper with a circulation of 300,000 copies.andM;It was obvious from the beginning that the hot metal typesetting we hadinherited from the previous regime was but a temporary solution.andP;  We Czechshad no experience in computer typesetting, and word processors were somethingjournalists knew merely by hearsay.andP;  Most had not even seen a word processor,let alone possess skills in their use.andM;The second problem was a shortage of finances.andP;  Since at the outset I wasresponsible for the technical aspects as well as international relations, Ihad to acquire experience as fast as possible in order to find a low-costsolution and obtain the necessary resources.andM;Help from abroad came in the most tangible form.andP;  In January 1990, I wasinvited to visit several Swedish newspapers to inspect their computer-runsystems.andP;  The Front Page Swedish consulting company in Stockholm was preparedto offer its experience free of charge.andP;  A few months later, I travelled toOttawa, Toronto and Winnipeg at the invitation of the Canadian ForeignMinistry.andP;  Here, too, I gathered invaluable experience, mainly from the Globeand Mail and Winnipeg Free Press but also from J.D.andP;  Graphics Inc.andM;We managed to solve our financial problems with the help of foreign aid.andO;Freedom House, together with the National Endowment for Democracy, offered usover $100,000 for the purchase of computer equipment.andP;  Some other foundationsas well as several of our countrymen abroad provided smaller sums.andP;  Mr.andO;William Briton, of the Mercury House publishers in San Francisco, gave us apersonal grant of $60,000.andP;  Without this aid, we would never have been ableto introduce electronic typesetting in such a short space of time.andM;At the outset, it appeared that compiling texts on cheap IBM XT clones andpreparing the layout on high-quality Macintosh machines would be the leastcostly and most efficient method.andP;  On a trip abroad, I saw Macs everywhere,while in Czechoslovakia they were totally unknown and viewed as &quot;not sopersonal.&quot;andP;  There was no microcomputer software that could be used for theCzech alphabet with all its accents and inverted circumflexes; we did noteven know how to transfer sets of text from PCs to the Macintosh machines.andO;We had to make a risky decision: to choose more advanced technology totallyunknown in Czechoslovakia or select less suitable computers with which wewere familiar.andM;We decided in favor of the Macintosh.andP;  One of the reasons was that therepresentative of Apple in Sweden .andP;  .  .  assured me that Apple was morethan keen to pave the way for its technology to Czechoslovakia.andO;Unfortunately, I have to say that subsequently Apple utterly disappointed myoriginal expectations, which were based on what I had been told about thefirm or in reading the memoirs of John Sculley.andP;  The ultimate fact of thematter was that Apple had given the franchise to a firm in Prague that was inno position to honor its commitments.andP;  But that was something we were unawareof last September when we concluded an agreement with the firm for the supplyof Macintosh machines.andM;Apple IMC had assured us that by the end of the year all of its machineswould be in operation with professional Czech fonts and with the Quark Xpressprogram for typesetting in Czech.andP;  When the firm failed to adhere to itspromised deadlines (and even delivered certain used hardware items althoughwe had paid for new ones), we realized that we could not rely on the firmwhen it came to providing the Czech alphabet characters.andP;  A letter I wrote toApple in Sweden was of no avail.andP;  Fortunately, we found three youngenthusiastic programmers in Prague who were great fans of the Mac.andP;  Westraight away employed these three devotees and asked them to prepare thekind of software we needed.andM;For several reasons we decided not to link the PCs into a network right fromthe start.andP;  First of all, computers were a total novelty for all ourjournalists; many of them were even afraid to have anything to do with themas they thought they would never learn to master them.andP;  That is why wedecided to proceed step by step.andP;  The first to receive a computer and printerwere journalists who showed an interest and .andP;  .  .  soon learned to usethem.andP;  When the others saw that their colleagues had succeeded in workingwith the computers, they too began to show an interest.andP;  Today, virtually allof them do their writing on computers.andM;In the subsequent phase, the computer printer link was retained, but theeditor also hands in his diskette.andP;  Psychological reasons apart, our decisionto reject the network was the fact that we were still working in temporarypremises where we have no intention of remaining.andP;  That is why theintroduction of a network would be an untimely investment.andP;  In the newbuilding, where we hope to move in the middle of the year, we want to set upa network serving at least the editors dealing with current affairs.andM;And the third reason is that the network will bring us, after all, one stephigher on the ladder of modern technology, and, as is generally known, themore complex the system, the more prone it is to break down.andM;The second major decision we had to make was the choice of an output device.andO;At first, we clearly considered phototypesetting.andP;  But we soon found outabout laser printers that have an accuracy of around 900 dpi manufactured byBirmy Graphics.andP;  We made several tests and discovered that the BirmyPowerPrint should be adequate for us while being less costly and simpler touse.andM;Since Apple had let us down in the introduction of the Czech alphabet, ourown experts promised that by the end of January, they themselves would adjustthe machine to our requirements and that we would be able to set our weekly16-page literary supplement on the machine.andP;  Yet reality was faster than ourcarefully worked out plans.andP;  When the allies attacked the Saddam Husseinregime on the night of January 17, the morning edition of Lidove Noviny wasalready off the press.andP;  That is why we decided to prepare a special issue inthe morning and issue it in the afternoon.andP;  The use of classical typesettingwas out of the question at the speed at which the issue had to be done.andP;  Thecomputer setting operators had not yet been fully trained, and the system wasnot yet quite operational.andP;  Our programmers, therefore, decided to man theterminals themselves and set the special issue.andP;  As we still did not have thePowerPrint, we set the pages on the Apple LaserWriter.andP;  When Iraq attackedIsrael during the night, we issued another special issue the following day.andO;This experience was of immense value to us.andP;  In the course of [organizing]the operation, which .andP;  .  .  was merely in its experiemental stage, weakspots showed up immediately, and we were able to put them right on the spot.andM;Lidove Noviny is at present gradually changing over to computer typesetting.andO;A mere 14 months passed between November 17, 1989, when the communistdictatorship finally collapsed in our country, and January 17, 1991, when weput out the first special issue of the paper on computers.andP;  Yet one completeera has elapsed during this period.andP;  The museum-ripe typesetting machines cango where they belong--they can become history.andP;  Instead, a modern era hasentered our editorial offices.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
