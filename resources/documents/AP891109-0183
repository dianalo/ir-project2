Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, said she was asking Navy SecretaryLawrence Garrett III to explain the ``alleged selection'' of Capt.Fred P. Moosally for sequential major command.   The Navy investigation concluded that gunner's mate ClaytonHartwig of Ohio ``most likely'' caused the April 19 explosion byinserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in oneof the ship's 16-inch guns.   Members of Congress, Hartwig's family and shipmates havecriticized the report. Oakar has asked the General AccountingOffice, the investigative arm of Congress, to review the Navy'sfindings.   The Navy screening board that took the action on Moosallyincludes Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, who headed the service'sinvestigation into the explosion, Oakar said.   ``I realize that consideration and possible selection of Capt.Moosally does not commit the Navy to consider him for sequentialmajor command, but I question the propriety of such action whilethere are several congressional and Navy investigations ongoing,''Oakar said.   Moosally, Oakar said, received a non-punitive ``letter ofadmonition'' Oct. 3 after an administrative hearing on the Iowaexplosion.   A sequential major command for a Navy officer would be a movefrom commanding a cruiser or battleship to another similar command,Navy officials said.   ``The selection or non-selection of an individual is predicatedon his or her past performance and an individual's entire careerand his or her performance during that entire career isconsidered,'' said Cmdr. Craig Quigley at the Pentagon.   ``If someone is selected, that means they are just eligible,''Quigley said.   Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., chairman of a House ArmedServices subcommittee that's reviewing the matter, cited an FBIreport that said its laboratory inquiry was inconclusive about whatcaused the explosion.   The Senate Armed Services Committee will question Milligan,Moosally and Robert J. Powers, who heads the criminal division ofthe Naval Investigative Service, at a hearing Nov. 16.</TEXT></DOC>
