SRM 2689 (a Class F fly ash from a bituminous coal) andSRM 2691 (a Class C fly ash from a subbituminous coal) have been includedin the study and also show inter-grain chemical variation. A classificationscheme of fly ash grain compositions has been developed and has provento be useful in illustrating the differences and similarities of theashes. There is a positive correlation, for example, between grains richin SiO/sub 2/ and Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/ and the Na/sub 2/O content of thegrains in lignite and subbituminous coal derived fly ashes. There isalso a positive correlation between grains rich in CaO and the MgO contentof the grains in both classes of fly ashes.</TEXT></DOC>
