In the static conditionthe combination of pipeline structure and weights has a positive submergedweight. But the structure and/or the weights have surfaces that generatehydrodynamic lift forces when the structure is towed along. The arrangementof the surfaces and the speed of tow are such that the submerged weightof the combination is reduced by at least 40 percent as compared withthe static condition.</TEXT></DOC>
