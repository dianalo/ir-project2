Theregulations establish requirements necessary to apply consistently andequitably the SES pay provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978,as amended. In particular, the regulations focus on setting individualbasic pay under the SES and implementing the statutory provisions on aggregatecompensation. They attempt to provide as much flexibility to agencies aspossible under the statutory provisions while providing adequate protectionsfor career appointees. The regulations also permit more flexibility onthe part of agencies in operating their SES performance appraisal systemsby revising the requirements on the number of SES summary rating levelsand the ending date of the SES performance appraisal period.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>February 22, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Neal Harwood, (202) 632-4486.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On August 8, 1988, OPM published proposedregulations (53 FR 29684) on pay and performance under the SES. The commentperiod, which was 60 days from the date of publication, ended on October7, 1988. Comments were received from 10 agencies. Comments are summarizedbelow, along with any changes in, or clarifications of, the proposed regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Performance Appraisal for the Senior Executive Service (Part 430,Subpart C)</ITAG>Two changes to current regulations were included in the proposed regulations.There was no opposition expressed in the comments to either change, andthey have both been incorporated in the final regulations.The first change amends andSection; 430.304(g) to allow agencies to havea three, four, or five summary rating-level system, rather than requiringfive levels. (The first three levels under any system must be those establishedby 5 U.S.C. 4314(a), i.e., unsatisfactory, minimally satisfactory, andfully successful.) As with all significant changes in performance plans,and in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 4312(c)(1) and Subpart A of Part 430, anagency must submit any revision in the number of rating levels in its performanceappraisal plan to OPM for review and determination on compliance with lawand applicable regulation. Submissions should be sent to the AssistantDirector for Pay and Performance Management, Room 7H30.The second change amends andSection; 430.305(a) to allow agencies to endtheir SES performance appraisal period at any time, rather than requiringit to end between June 30 and September 30. If an agency changes the enddate of its appraisal period, it is not necessary to obtain the prior approvalof OPM, but the agency should notify OPM of the change when it is made.The notification should explain how the agency will handle the transitionfrom the old to the new period. For example, if the end date is changedfrom September 30 to December 31, the agency should state whether the timefrom October through December will be added to the old period or the newperiod during the transition, or will be rated separately.<ITAG tagnum="84">Pay Under the Senior Executive Service (Part 534, Subpart D)</ITAG>(a) Setting individual basic pay.The proposed regulations at andSection; 534.401 provided procedures for implementing5 U.S.C. 5383(c), under which pay for SES members may be adjusted onlyonce in a 12-month period by an appointing authority.One agency asked whether the 12-month waiting period for a pay adjustmentapplies when an executive is reassigned between organizations which arein the same agency, but under different appointing authorities. andSection;534.401(c)(1) has been revised to clarify that the waiting period appliesto any pay adjustment in the same agency, so that pay may not be adjustedupon the reassignment unless 12 months have elapsed since the last adjustment.Under proposed andSection; 534.401(d), pay could be set at any rate upontransfer between agencies, since a new appointing authority is involved.One agency commented that it was not clear whether the 12-month waitingperiod for a pay adjustment is continuous or starts over if the gainingagency sets an individual's pay at the same level as the losing agency.A new 12-month waiting period begins only if there is a change in the ESrate upon the transfer (e.g., from ES-3 to ES-4). Otherwise, the 12-monthwaiting period is considered to begin at the time of the last adjustmentin the losing agency. The regulations have been clarified on this point.Under proposed andSection; 534.401(e)(1), if there was a break in SES serviceof more than 30 days, pay could be set at any rate upon reappointment tothe SES; and under proposed andSection; 534.401(c)(1)(iii), a new 12-monthwaiting period for a pay adjustment was required following the reappointmentaction, no matter at which rate the pay was set.One agency suggested requiring a 12-month break in service before allowingpay to be set at any rate upon reappointment, on the basis that an executivemight be willing to take even a 30-day break just to be able to get a higherpay rate. We believe 30 days is a sufficient break. It is each agency'sresponsibility to assure that the break, whatever the length, is not solelyfor the purpose of avoiding the 12-month waiting period between pay ratechanges.Two agencies argued that if the reappointment was at the same rate theexecutive previously held, the 12-month waiting period should begin asof the time of the executive's last pay adjustment, not the date of thereappointment action. The agencies said that this would increase flexibilityby allowing an agency to reappoint the executive at a higher pay levelimmediately (starting a new 12-month waiting period) or to reappoint theexecutive at the same pay level and wait to see how the executive performsbefore deciding whether to increase the pay level (without having to waita full 12 months).We agree that some additional flexibility is appropriate.Section 534.401(c)(1)(iii) has been revised to provide that a new 12-monthwaiting period for a pay change starts upon reappointment only if the executive'snew ES rate is different from the former rate or if the break in SES serviceexceeds 12 months. Otherwise, the waiting period begins on the date ofthe last previous adjustment preceding the reappointment. For example,if an executive received an ES-3 rate on March 1, 1988, left the SES onJuly 1, 1988, and was reappointed to the SES as an ES-3 on October 1, 1988,the executive would be eligible for a change in pay on March 1, 1989. Ifthe executive was reappointed to the SES as an ES-4, however, on October1, 1988, the executive would not be eligible for a change in pay untilOctober 1, 1989.Proposed andSection;534.401(e)(1) did not specifically state how pay wouldbe set upon reappointment if there had been a break in service of 30 daysor less. It has been clarified to state that in this situation, pay maybe set at any ES rate if the individual's last ES pay adjustment was morethan 12 months earlier. If the last ES pay adjustment was less than 12months earlier, pay must be set at the former rate. It may then be changedafter 12 months have elapsed from the last adjustment.  Section 534.401(f) continued the restriction currently in andSection;534.402that the ES rate of an executive who converted to the SES under SubpartC of Part 317 may not be reduced below ``the basic payable salary'' forthe executive immediately before the conversion. One agency asked whether``basic payable salary'' means the actual dollar amount received immediatelybefore conversion, or the current salary level of the grade and step occupiedimmediately before conversion. The term means the former, i.e., the actualdollar amount received immediately before conversion. (b) Aggregate compensation. Proposed andSection;534.402 defined an individual's aggregate compensation(basic pay, performance awards, Presidential rank awards, and physicianscomparability allowances) and provided, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5383(b),that such compensation for a fiscal year may not exceed the pay rate ineffect at the end of the fiscal year for level I of the Executive Schedule.The proposed regulations also explained how any amount exceeding the levelI ceiling was to be paid later, including situations where an individualtransferred to another agency, separated from the Federal service, or died.No comments were received on these provisions, and they have been incorporatedin the final regulations as proposed.  <ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291.
