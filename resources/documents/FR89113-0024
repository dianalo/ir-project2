Thestandards, policies, standard specifications, guides, and references (publications)that are approved by the FHWA for application on all Federal-aid highwayprojects are listed in 23 CFR Part 625. The standards, policies, and standardspecifications for pavement design are cited in andSection; 625.4(a)(11).Part 626 currently approves and incorporates by reference the publicationentitled the ``American Association of State Highway and TransportationOfficials (AASHTO) Interim Guide for Design of Pavement Structures, 1972,''Chapter III Revised 1981, for application on Federal-aid projects. On May7, 1986 (51 FR 16830), the list of publications contained in Part 625 wasrevised and updated. In order to accurately differentiate between thosepublications establishing Federal standards and those containing guidanceand information, a new section entitled ``Guides and references'' was addedto Part 625. For those publications that provide informational and guidancematerial only, the incorporation by reference was withdrawn and the publicationcitation was placed in the new guide and reference section. By the May7, 1986, final rule, an additional publication entitled ``Guidelines onPavement Management, AASHTO 1985'' (Pavement Management Guide) was addedas a reference at andSection; 625.5(a)(7). To be consistent with the May7, 1986, policy on reference citations, the FHWA will add the 1986 publicationentitled ``AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures'' (1986 Guide)to andSection; 625.5(a), ``Guides and references.'' The AASHTO views thePavement Management Guide and the 1986 Guide as information and guidancematerials and not as technical policies and standards. The FHWA sharesthis view and is revising Part 626. A notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 26, 1988, (53 FR 2041) in which theFHWA requested comments on the proposed regulation. Originally commentswere to be received by April 25, 1988; however, pursuant to a request received,the comment period was extended to May 27, 1988, by notice published inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 11, 1988, (53 FR 11875).<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>Sixty-nine written comments were received in the docket. Of the sixty-ninecomments, thirty-six were from SHAs, fourteen were from county and cityhighway agencies, three were from local planning organizations and sixteenfrom other public and private organizations or individuals. The majorityof comments received, including those from AASHTO, support both the intentand content of the proposed policy. The following summarizes the comments,suggestions and actions taken.Several commenters expressed concern that the 1986 ``AASHTO Guide for Designof Pavement Structures'' (1986 Guide) was being mandated as a standard.It was never the intent of the FHWA to mandate the use of 1986 Guide. TheFHWA recognizes that there are several acceptable pavement design procedures.The States may use the design procedures outlined in the 1986 Guide orthey may use other pavement design procedures that either by past performanceor by support from research are satisfactory for the pertinent conditions.A number of commenters addressed PMS technical issues, many of which werediscussed in the supplementary information section of the proposed rule.Most of these comments stated that the FHWA should not be too prescriptiveregarding the detailed features and analysis procedures to be containedin a PMS. As explained in the following paragraphs, it is the intent ofthis policy that SHAs develop a PMS tailored to their specific needs andcircumstances. The listing of key features included in the supplementaryinformation to the proposed rule is intended to demonstrate typical processesand scope of PMSs. The ``Pavement Management Guide'' is cited as guidance,and along with other PMS-related materials will be used as reference materialfor determining the acceptability of an SHA's PMS. The FHWA will allowflexibility to SHAs in the development of their PMS.A number of commenters stated that a complete detailed inventory, includinginformation on pavement materials and structural composition, representsa great amount of effort and should not be required. The statement concerningdetailed inventory was part of the discussion on the ``Pavement ManagementGuide'' concepts, and as such represents guidance on good practice in PMSdevelopment, but it is not a required part of a PMS. The use of inventorieswith extensive information such as layer types, thicknesses, material properties,etc. can be very valuable within a PMS; particularly when conducting investigationsinto the performance of a range of design parameters. It may be appropriateto collect and store this information on higher-order routes only wherereliability is more critical and loads are more extensive. One commenterstated that the policy should distinguish between network level and projectlevel data needs. The FHWA considers both levels to be important; however,the SHAs will have the flexibility to determine the appropriate data requirementsfor each level.One commenter stated that traffic control devices such as edge and centerlines should be included as part of the PMS data elements. The FHWA intentregarding the PMS requirement is restricted to achievement of safe, cost-effectivestructural and ride quality performance of the pavement. There is nothingto prevent an SHA from including items such as edge and center lines, signs,guardrail, etc. in a more complete inventory. While the FHWA recognizesthe benefits that can be obtained from such data, it is not appropriateto require it as part of the PMS.  Section 626.3 as published in the notice of proposed rulemaking containedten definitions. A few commenters suggested that the definitions be thesame as those used by AASHTO. This was accomplished to the extent believedprudent. The definition for ``analysis period'' was changed to more closelyconform to the ASSHTO definition. The definition for ``pavement structure''remains the same as the AASHTO definition. Several commenters objectedto the inclusion of user costs in the definition of ``life cycle cost.''They pointed out that there is substantial disagreement in the highwayindustry regarding the make-up of user costs, as well as considerable disagreementin the literature regarding the specific magnitudes of these costs. Itis recognized that the current state-of-the-art includes many uncertaintieswhich may have an unrealistic or unbalanced effect on life cycle cost analyses.Because the definition of ``analysis period'' was revised, thus eliminatingthe reference to life cycle costs, and because of these uncertainties relatingto user costs, the definition of ``life cycle cost'' has been deleted.The definitions for ``low volume road'' and ``pavement design'' have alsobeen eliminated, as they have become unnecessary. The definition for ``pavementmaintenance'' has been modified to: ``all routine actions, both responsiveand preventative, which are taken by a State or other parties to preservethe pavement structure including joints, drainage, surface, and shoulders,as necessary for its safe and efficient utilization.'' The definition for``pavement management'' has been replaced with a definition for ``pavementmanagement system'', as the concept of an all-inclusive pavement managementhas been removed. One commenter questioned the use of the phrase ``* ** finding optimum strategies * * *'' within the definition of pavementmanagement (now pavement management system). The commenter stated thatoptimizing a product implies that some aspect of the product will be maximized;yet, the parameter to be optimized (such as years of life or pavement condition)is not specified in the definition. The FHWA agrees that this pharase issomewhat ambiguous, and has replaced ``optimum'' with ``cost-effective''in the definition of PMS. The definitions for ``pavement performance period'',``pavement reconstruction'', and ``pavement rehabilitation'' remain unchanged.Section 626.5(a) published in the proposed rulemaking required that eachSHA have a PMS approved by the FHWA. Several commenters stated that itis not necessary to require that SHAs have PMS, or that it is not the roleof the FHWA to mandate implementation of such a system. One commenter wentfurther to state that these requirements were contrary to the Administration's``new Federalism,'' wherein States are to be given as much flexibilityas possible when expending Federal funds. On the other hand, most of thecommenters took a very positive view of the PMS requirement and the roleof the FHWA, and endorsed the proposed rule. The FHWA continues to believethat it is appropriate to require that SHA's have a system that will helpassure that the Federal investment is used in a way that protects safetyand provides cost-effective pavement life cycles. General guidelines onthe various features of a PMS are not considered sufficient. Only a completePMS will enable an SHA to effectively produce the full range of informationneeded to assist decisionmakers. To better define the FHWA role, the requirementthat a PMS be ``approved by FHWA'' has been changed to ``acceptable toFHWA.'' The goal is to have each SHA implement a PMS which will be usedin the State's decisionmaking process. It is not the intent to producevoluminous documentation for FHWA approval. The new language encourageseach SHA to design a PMS tailored to its own needs, and to work with theFHWA during the development process to assure that it will be capable ofproviding the desired products. Most of the local agency commenters, and a number of SHAs, indicated thatthe rule should not require the PMS to include Federal-aid routes undercity and county jurisdiction. The FHWA never intended that this be thecase. The FHWA's original statement that ``each SHA shall have a pavementmanagement system * * *'' assumed that the PMS would be limited to routesunder SHA jurisdiction. The final rule clearifies this by adding the phrase``* * * under its jurisdiction'' to the sentence. Several commenters onthis issue went on to state the significant benefits of local-level PMSs,and the value of some level of coordination between SHA and local-levelsystems. The FHWA agrees with these comments, and a sentence expressingthe desirability of a local PMS for pavements under local jurisdictionhas been added. Section 626.5(a) of the proposed rulemaking also stated that the PMS wasto be implemented within 4 years from the effective date of this regulation.Several commenters indicated that more than 4 years would be required toimplement a PMS. In order to restrict required actions to areas of highestFederal interest, the final rule requires that only rural arterial andurban principal arterial routes under SHA jursidiction must be a part ofthe PMS. Rural arterial routes are defined as those routes having a functionalclassification of Interestate. Other Principal Arterial, or Minor Arterial.Urban principal arterial routes are defined as those routes having a functionalclassification of Interstate. Other principal Arterial, and Other Freewaysand Expressways. The SHAs are encouraged to expand coverage to other routes,but it is not a requirement. With the PMS coverage limited to only themore important routes, the 4 year period is considered to be reasonableand appropriate. In addition, the requirement that a PMS be ``implemented''in 4 years has been changed to ``operational'' within 4 years. This wasdone in recognition that some components of a PMS may not be fully implementedin 4 years, especially those which may require several years' worth ofperformance data. The FHWA would expect that the framework and basic proceduresof a PMS would be in-place and operational within the 4 year period.A few commenters complained that the pavement management requirement wouldnecessitate significant expenditures for the purchasing of equipment andthe measuring of pavement condition and distress. Many States have alreadypurchased highly sophisticated pavement condition measuring devices suchas profile-measuring equipment and video distress gathering systems. Significantproductivity, accuracy, and repeatability benefits can be gained from usingthese systems, and they are continually being improved. However, the FHWArecognizes that acceptable PMSs can be developed without the use of thesesystems, and they are not required as part of SHA's PMSs. The SHA's areprovided the flexibility necessary to develop a practical and implementablePMS acceptable to the FHWA, within reasonable resource levels.Section 626.5(b) of the proposed rulemaking prescribed policy for the designof new, reconstructed, and rehabilitated pavements. Based on the numberof comments received, it became apparent that this section should be splitinto two paragraphs for purposes of clarification. Section 626.5(b) nowprescribes policy for the design of new and reconstructed pavements, whereasandSection; 626.5(c) prescribes policy for the design of rehabilitated pavements.Section 626.5(b) of the proposed rulemaking required that a comprehensivepayment type selection and design process for new, reconstructed, and rehabilitatedpavements be included as part of the PMS. Several commenters stated thatpavement design should not be required as part of the functional responsibilityof a PMS, or in the same SHA organizational element as a PMS. Others statedthat the PMS should not decide the final design alternative. One commenterstated that the rule erroneously implied that States center their entirepavement strategy on data and reports generated from the PMS. The FHWAagrees with these comments. It is not the intent to change State organizationalstructures or to require that the PMS itself include final pavement designfunctions. A PMS is best characterized as a tool for decisionmakers toconsult for information, which is then combined with engineering judgmentand other factors in reaching decisions. It is clear that the characterizationof pavement management as encompassing ``all the activities involved inthe planning, design, construction, maintenance, evaluation, and rehabilitationof pavements'' is too extensive when translating to existing SHA organizationallines of authority and functions. While the FHWA believes that this conceptis valid when viewing SHA functions as a whole, it is certainly not theFHWA's intent that this rule needlessly disrupt current operating procedures.Accordingly, the FHWA is not requiring that the final pavement type selectionand design processes be part of the PMS. Instead, each SHA will be requiredto have a type selection and design process which is acceptable to theFHWA. However, the type selection and design analytical processes shouldbe coordinated with the PMS process, and draw upon and use the inventoryand performance data which is contained in the PMS database.Section 626.5(b) also required that an analysis period of at least 30 yearsbe used for all projects except that a shorter period may be used for lowvolume roads. Many commenters objected to the mandatory 30 year analysisperiod and the term ``low volume'' roads as a threshold for a shorter analysisperiod. They felt that 30 years was an arbitrary number. Most agenciesdid not have the historic performance data to make an economic analysisof several alternatives for a 30 year period. Because of these concerns,the policy has been revised and the low volume road threshold eliminated.The 30-year analysis period was originally established to ensure that atleast one rehabilitation operation was included during the economic analysis.This section was reworded to require that the analysis period include aninitial performance period, plus at least one rehabilitation operation.The reference to a shorter analysis period for low volume roads was eliminated,as it is considered to be no longer necessary.Section 626.5(b) also required that an engineering and economic analysisof an appropriate range of strategies be performed for all new, reconstructed,and rehabilitated pavements. For existing pavements, the analysis shouldinclude both reconstruction and rehabilitation alternatives. Several commentersstated that requiring an economic analysis for the design of all rehabilitatedpavements would not be practical, as it would generate unnecessary paperwork.The FHWA agrees that this would be the case for minor rehabilitation projects,where the corrective strategy is obvious. The policy no longer requiresan economic analysis of alternative actions for all rehabilitation projects.However, in order to obtain the goal of achieving the best return possiblefor the money expended, it is considered essential that major rehabilitationprojects include an economic analysis. For projects involving rehabilitatedpavements, an engineering and an economic analysis of alternative rehabilitationstrategies will be required if the pavement is approaching terminal serviceabilityand exhibiting significant structural deficiencies. Alternative rehabilitationstrategies should include both reconstruction and rehabilitation alternatives.The analysis period used shall be the same for all alternatives. If anexisting pavement structure is sound and the cost to restore serviceabilityis minor when compared to the cost of a new pavement structure or majorrehabilitation, an engineering and economic analysis of alternative actionsmay not be necessary.Section 626.5(c) as published in the proposed rulemaking required thateach project involving construction of a pavement have a skid resistantsurface. It also required all pavement rehabilitation and reconstructionprojects to incorporate other cost-effective opportunities to enhance safety.Several commenters requested that the reference to skid resistance surfacebe deleted, whereas one commenter requested that specific skid values beprovided. It is felt that the existing FHWA policy and technical guidanceon this subject are adequate. No revisions were made to the safety sectionof the policy, but it is now referenced under andSection; 626.5(d).One commenter criticized the FHWA proposal for not providing uniform performancestandards for pavements. In particular, the commenter cited the lack ofa threshold for coefficients of friction and the absence of performancecriteria for maintained levels of skid resistance. According to this commenter,the FHWA is acting irresponsibly from a safety standpoint by basing theskid resistance requirement on subjective factors. The FHWA disagrees withthis comment. Imposing numerical requirements for minimum skid resistancewould create many legal difficulties. Such requirements would impose asevere financial burden on all agencies involved in construction of pavementsunder the Federal-aid highway program. Many city and county agencies wouldbe forced to discontinue construction of Federal-aid projects, creatinga financial hardship for them. Many other cities and counties, to avoidthe legal ramifications resulting whenever a pavement failed to meet therequirements, would also decide to stop using Federal-aid funds. On theresulting non-Federal-aid projects, officials would not have to complywith any minimum skid resistance values included in the pavement policy.In addition, although most projects are designed with safety in mind, theFHWA recognizes that reasonable opportunities to enhance safety are sometimesoverlooked. Under the new pavement policy, State and local officials developingFederal-aid projects would have to comply with andSection;626.5(d), whichwould ensure that other opportunities to enhance safety are considered.By causing many of these officials to forego Federal-aid, incorporatingminimum requirements to increase skid resistance would have the oppositeeffect. These non-Federal-aid projects would not be covered by the skidresistance requirements or andSection;626.5(d). Overall safety would be significantlyless than if Federal-aid funds were used and the projects were developedin accordance with the proposed rulemaking and other Federal-aid requirements.Thus, this commenter's recommendation was not adopted. The FHWA believesthat existing policies and technical guidance are adequate. Proposed andSection;626.7(a) required that the design of new and reconstructedpavements be based on the approved pavement management system. As discussedpreviously, several commenters indicated that pavement design should notbe placed by mandate under the organizational responsibility of a PMS,or that the PMS should not decide the design alternative. Section 626.5(b)was subsequently modified to require that each SHA have a design processacceptable to the FHWA. The inclusion of this design process within thePMS is optional. Section 626.7(a) is thus being modified to provide consistencywith andSection;626.5(b) by requiring that the design of new and reconstructedpavements be based on the SHA's pavement type selection and pavement designprocesses. Proposed andSection;626.7(b) required that the design of rehabilitated pavementsboth be a cost-effective solution based on the approved PMS and providea minimum performance period of 8-years. Longer performance periods wererecommended on high type, high volume facilities, especially where trafficdisruption costs were significant. A provision for exceptions to the 8-yearminimum performance period was provided, when supported by historical performancedata and economic analyses. This section received a large number of comments.Several commenters stated that requiring a detailed economic analysis ofalternative actions for the design of all rehabilitated pavements wouldnot be practical, as it would generate unnecessary paperwork. This is feltto be the case in many minor rehabilitation projects, where the correctivestrategy is obvious. Therefore, in those cases where the existing pavementstructure is sound and the cost to restore serviceability is minor whencompared to the cost of a new pavement structure, a detailed economic analysisis not necessary. However, as discussed previously, in order to obtainthe goal of achieving the best return possible for the money expended,it is considered essential that major rehabilitation projects include aneconomic analysis of the alternative actions. Section 626.5(c) has beenmodified to require an economic analysis for major rehabilitation projectsas part of the pavement rehabilitation selection process, which must beacceptable to the FHWA. Since these analyses are part of the process, itis no longer necessary to refer to them under andSection;626.7(b). As discussed previously, several commenters responded that the design ofrehabilitated pavements should not be a required element of a PMS. Section626.5(c) has been modified to require that each SHA have a pavement rehabilitationselection process that is acceptable to the FHWA. This selection processshall include a methodology for structural design. The inclusion of thisdesign process within the PMS is optional. Section 626.7(b) has thus beenmodified to conform with andSection;626.5(c) by eliminating the requirementthat the design be based on the PMS. Several commenters suggested that the minimum performance period of 8 yearswas too restrictive and recommended that it be shortened. As discussedpreviously, the proposed rulemaking addressed all Federal-aid systems,whereas andSection;626.5(a) has been revised so that only rural arterialsand urban principal arterials are covered by a SHA's PMS. While all ofthese routes are to be included in the PMS, it is recognized that someroutes are far more important than others. Section 626.7(b) has subsequentlybeen modified to require a minimum performance period of 8-years only forrehabilitation projects on routes classified as Interstate. Other PrincipalArterials (both rural and urban), and Other Freeways and Expressways, regardlessof jurisdiction. For all other Federal-aid pavement rehabilitation projects,a minimum performance period of 5 years may be allowed. As a result of the above change, the lower order of the Federal-aid systemis now subject to the 5-year minimum performance period for rehabilitationprojects. There is no provision for exceptions to the 5-year performanceperiod. Shorter term strategies on these types of roadways are consideredmaintenance. Exceptions may be granted to the 8-year performance periodon a project-by-project basis. Proposed andSection;626.7(c) required that pavement maintenance not be eligiblefor Federal-aid funding. No comments were received, and this section wasnot modified. Based on a further review and consideration of comments received, the FHWAis establishing a policy which will ensure that SHAs utilize appropriatepractices and procedures to provide safe and cost-effective pavements.The SHAs will have a PMS that is acceptable to the FHWA and that coversthe more major routes under their jurisdiction. The PMS shall be operationalwithin four years. Each SHA will be required to have a process that isacceptable to the FHWA for the type selection and design of new and reconstructedpavement structures. Each SHA will also be required to have a pavementrehabilitation selection process that is acceptable to the FHWA and thatincludes identification of candidate solutions and a methodology for structuraldesign. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact </ITAG>The FHWA has determined that this document does not contain a major ruleunder Executive Order 12291 or a significant rgulation under the regulatorypolicies and procedures of the Department of Transportation. The FHWA hasalso determined that the expected impact of these revisions will be minimal.This determination is based on the fact that the SHAs will be requiredto merely formalize the pavement management processes that are currentlybeing followed. In addition, the basic design criteria for pavement designremains essentially unchanged. The material contained in the publications``Guidelines on Pavement Management, AASHTO 1985'' and the 1986 ``AASHTOGuide for Design of Pavement Structures'' is not in fact a policy or standard,but simply provides guidance for use at the discretion of the designer.The SHAs will be allowed to continue to use the same basic pavement designprocedures based on past performances. Variation from present practicesand technical criteria will not be significant. As stated in the preamble,the preparation of a Pavement Management System (PMS) should not placeany undue burdens on the States' resources. As a practical matter, mostSHAs have informally been establishing a procedure for the selection anddesign of new pavement structures and rehabilitation strategies. Therefore,a full regulatory evaluation is not required. For the same reasons andunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354),it is hereby certified that this action will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511),the reporting or recordkeeping requirements that are included in the proposedregulation will be submitted for approval to the Office of Management andBudget. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that thefinal rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrantthe preparation of a Federalism Assessment. A regulatory information number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory actionlisted in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory InformationService Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of eachyear. The RIN number contained in the heading of this document can be usedto cross reference this action with the Unified Agenda.<ITAG tagnum="21">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.205, HighwayPlanning and Construction.
