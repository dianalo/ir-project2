Kissingergrudgingly supported Senate ratification of the new U.S. Sovietmedium-range arms reduction agreement on Tuesday, saying it nevershould have been agreed to in its present form.   But Kissinger said the treaty should be approved withoutcrippling amendments because failure to do so would ``magnify alldifficulties'' within the NATO alliance.   ``The removal of American intermediate range missiles (fromEurope) is now irreversible,'' because of the pressures of Europeanpublic opinion and other factors, Kissinger told the Senate ForeignRelations Committee.   Because of that, he said, defeat of the treaty in the Senate``would generate a crisis in the Atlantic Alliance which in the endwould almost certainly lead to the unilateral withdrawal of U.S.missiles from Europe and undermine the cohesion of the alliance.''   ``My concerns cannot be removed by the refusal of the Senate toratify the agreement,'' Kissinger said. ``Failure to ratify ...cannot cure its defects.   Meanwhile, because they had ``manuevered themselves into aposition where they think they now have no choice but to stand byproposals they never thought would be agreed to in the firstplace.''   The treaty is the result of NATO's 1979 ``dual-track'' decisionto deploy U.S. weapons to counter Soviet SS-20 medium-rangemissiles while at the same time negotiating their removal.   ``They felt the obligation to imply that these weapons werethere for arms control purposes and were therefore open tonegotiation,'' Kissinger said of the European political leaders.   Kissinger said he believes the treaty is flawed because it willnot reduce in any significant way the ability of the Soviet Unionto devastate Europe with other nuclear weapons and because itsubstantially reduces the ability of the United States to retaliatewith nuclear weapons based in Europe.   Nuclear deterrence in Europe will now rely primarily on weaponsbased in the United States and Kissinger said that creates ``apsychological and political imbalance,'' especially when weighedagainst Soviet superiority in conventional forces.   But he said rejection of the treaty would severely undermineconfidence in American leadership, demoralize the alliance, andignite neutralism.   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the IntelligenceCommittee, said his committee has ``high confidence'' in theability of the United States to verify Soviet compliance with thetreaty.   But ``there's a very big question mark about our ability toverify'' a separate treaty providing deep cuts in long-rangenuclear weapons, Boren said in an interview.   ``The problem there is one of money, not technical ability,'' heexplained. ``We have the capability, but the administration has tocome forward and propose a budget plan to pay for it.''   The Intelligence Committee has been holding closed-door hearingsfor three weeks about verification capabilities.   In his testimony, Glitman provided a detailed analysis as partof the Senate's thorough examination of the pact signed 10 weeksago by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Thetreaty will eliminate all nuclear-tipped missiles with ranges ofabout 300 to 3,000 miles.   Armed Services committee members say the detailed scrutiny isneeded because of disputes about the meaning of past treaties,particularly the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   The current treaty is being considered by the Senate amid afight between the Democratic-controlled Congress and the Reaganadministration over the precise meaning of the 1972 pact andwhether it banned futuristic weapons such as those being developedunder the Strategic Defense Initiative.   Article 14 of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treatysays neither side shall do anything, now or in the future, toundercut the pact.   Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., told Glitman that ``I'm concerned aboutarticle 14'' because it might limit future U.S. help to other NATOnations.   ``If we don't spell out what the future obligations are,'' saidQuayle, ``down the road I can foresee some problems ... now is thetime to give us as much running room as possible in the future forour technology.''   But Glitman took the opposite approach, noting that the treatyis extremely specific in spelling out prohibited weapons, alongwith their components.   ``If it is not prohibited by the treaty, we can do it,'' saidGlitman. Later, he added that ``we're best protected by statingwhat we cannot do.''   Glitman cited one method in which he said U.S. aid to NATO wouldnot be affected. The treaty bans cruise missiles, he said, but itdoesn't block the transfer of U.S. technology to NATO nations suchas Great Britain to develop cruise missiles.   Glitman said the U.S. negotiating team resisted Soviet effortsto block U.S. help for NATO. ``We knew their goal was to find a wayto put a brake on NATO activities,'' he said.   Reagan promised Tuesday that the United States will do its partto ensure that the NATO alliance remains strong, saying in anaddress broadcast to Europe that ``our destiny is coupled withyours.''   In the address, which came a week before a NATO summit meeting,Reagan reaffirmed the alliance agreement that an attack on anymember nation is an attack against all of them. ``Simply put, anattack on Munich is the same as an attack on Chicago,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
