The six-member panel, appointed by the governments ofNorway, Sweden and Denmark, sharply criticized the ferry'sowner, VR DaNo Lines, its captain, crew and Norwegian rescueofficials in the disaster last April 7. TheBahamas-registered ferry was on an overnight run from Oslo toCopenhagen when a fire in the car deck spread through theship. It had 383 passengers and 99 crew aboard.   The panel's report said the Scandinavian Star wasbasically well-maintained but had an untrained, oftenoverworked crew. The crew lacked emergency training, wasunfamiliar with the ship and did not use all availableequipment to help passengers escape smoke and fire, thereport said. Some of the crew were Portuguese and could notunderstand orders in English, said the 1,000-page document.   The panel urged the Scandinavian countries to requiresprinklers and fire detectors, which it said may have savedthe victims. It also called for compulsory safety trainingfor crews on ferries sailing Nordic seas.                                                                                                          FUNDING JAPAN'S GULF PLEDGE                                                                                                          Japan said it plans to fund its new pledge of $9 billionfor multinational forces in the Gulf with temporary increasesin gasoline, cigarette and corporate taxes. Under the plan,short-term government bonds would be issued to collect themoney quickly. These would be repaid in turn with the highertaxes, to be levied only in the fiscal year beginning April1, government spokesman Misoji Sakamoto said. The $9 billionpledge, which follows a separate $4 billion contribution lastSeptember to the allied forces and front-line states,averages out to about $76 for each Japanese citizen.                                                                                                          POWER FROM PALM OIL                                                                                                          Brazil announced that palm oil would be available as a newalternative-energy source to power heavy farm machinery andtransport vehicles. Agricultural Minister Antonio Cabrerasaid a mixture of three-quarters palm oil and one-quarterdiesel oil has been used to power a test passenger car 50,000miles. Mr. Cabrera also said the palm-oil fuel was muchcleaner when burned than conventional fuels such as gasolineor alcohol.                                                                                                          SOUTH KOREA'S RISING PRICES                                                                                                          South Korea's consumer prices in January rose 2.1% fromDecember and 10.6% from a year ago, the Economic PlanningBoard reported. Officials said it was the sharpest one-monthincrease since June 1981, when consumer prices went up 2.8%.The January increase was attributed to price rises almostacross the board, including fruits, meat, vegetables, subwayand railway rates, and heating coal.                                                                                                          FALLING DEBRIS                                                                                                          Debris from a disused Soviet space station is likely tofall to Earth sometime between Feb. 4 and 8, a spokesman forthe Dutch Interior Ministry said. Most of the Salyut 7 spacestation, currently tumbling uncontrolled in space, is likelyto burn up when it re-enters the earth's atmosphere. But somepieces large enough to cause damage may survive. This debriscould land anywhere in a band around the planet stretchingfrom southern Sweden to the tip of South America, theministry said. Salyut 7 was launched as a manned spacestation in 1982 but hasn't been used for more than fouryears.                                                                                                          TRADE TALKS                                                                                                          Trade negotiators are holding a series of private talks inGeneva in a bid to break the deadlock over agriculturalsubsidies that has stalled efforts to liberalize globalcommerce, a trade source said. The source said seniorofficials had traveled from the U.S., the European Community,Japan, Canada and Australia for individual meetings withArthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade. The source said it was unclear when thefull Uruguay Round of trade negotiations would resume.                                                                                                          SWISS WEAPON EXPORTS DECLINE                                                                                                          Exports of Swiss weapons declined 15% in value last yearto 329.7 million Swiss francs ($260.3 million), the DefenseMinistry said.   A ministry official said the drop was in line with trendsin other industrialized countries. He cited a Swissweapons-export ban for Mideast countries after Iraq'sinvasion of Kuwait and competition from Third World armsindustries.   Swiss statistics don't cover the increasingly importantexports of weapons technology and know-how. Explosives andabout a dozen chemicals that could be used to make poison gasare included.   Canada, Austria and Germany were the biggest customers in1990, taking some 40% of total exports, the government said.

Uganda's elephant population has reportedly doubled withina decade due to an intensified war against poachers and otherconservation measures. Kampala's New Vision newspaper quotedEric Edroma, director of Uganda National Parks, as sayingthat the number of elephants had risen from 1,350 in 1980 toan estimated 3,000 this year. . . .
