The new rule generally requires every self-propelledcommercial motor vehicle operated by a private motor carrier of propertyin interstate motor carrier of migrant workers to be marked with specificinformation. The required marking must be located on both sides of theself-propelled vehicle and consist of the motor carrier's name or tradename, the city or community and State [name abbreviated] in which the carriermaintains its principal place of business, or in which the vehicle is customarilybased, and the motor carrier identification number, if issued by the FHWA,preceded by the letters ``USDOT.'' The statory authority for the promulgationof this rule is 49 U.S.C. 3104. Accordingly, the FHWA limited the applicationof this marking requirement to private motor carriers of property and motorcarriers of migrant workers expressly covered by this section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Applicability of the Marking Requirement to All Vehicles Subject tothe FMCSRs </ITAG>The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) regulates the marking of commercialmotor vehicles operated by another segment of the motor carrier industry.That segment is comprised of 2 groups of for-hire motor carriers, namely,common and contract motor carriers of property or passengers. The preamble to the final rule issued on May 19, 1988, which establishedthe marking requirement stated: <ITAG tagnum="21">There is a segment of the motor carrier industry that neither theDOT nor the ICC has the authority to regulate insofar as vehicle identificationand marking is concerned. That segment is known as ``exempt carriers.''``Exempt carriers'' are for-hire motor carriers that have been exemptedfrom economic regulation. This group of for-hire motor carriers is currentlysubject to Federal safety regulations, but will not be required to marktheir vehicles. </ITAG>Generally, the ``exempt carrier'' segment is comprised of (1) for-hiremotor carriers who transport commodities (e.g., fresh fruits or vegetables)in interstate commerce that are exempt from the economic regulations ofthe ICC; (2) for-hire motor carriers transporting the U.S. mail in interstatecommerce under contract to the United States Postal Service; (3) for-hiremotor carriers of passengers transporting school children or school personnelin interstate commerce when such transportation is at the direction and/orunder the control of a public school system; (4) for-hire motor carriersof property engaged in the emergency towing of disabled vehicles from thepoint of disablement to another location in interstate commerce; and (5)for-hire motor carriers of property operating wholly within ICC designatedcommercial zones. The FHWA believes that having these groups of motor carriers exempt fromany type of marking requirement is a problem. A substantial number of commercialmotor vehicles would continue to be operated on public highways with littleor no information visible to the general public to identify the operatorof a specific vehicle. The Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1984 (MCSA of 1984) (49 U.S.C. app. 2501-2520(Supp. II 1984)) authorizes the FHWA to establish a minimum vehicle markingrequirement for all commercial motor vehicles, as defined in the MCSA of1984, if such a requirement will assist in ensuring that commercial motorvehicles are safely maintained, equipped, loaded, and operated. The FHWAbelieves that a marking requirement for all commercial motor vehicles operatedin interstate commerce will assist in ensuring that those vehicles aresafely maintained, equipped, loaded, and operated. The FHWA is interested in receiving comments on a proposal to extend themarking requirements to all self-propelled commercial motor vehicles subjectto the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs). The FHWA is alsointerested in what effect such requirements would have on foreign motorcarriers.To implement such a new provision, the FHWA would add to the motor carriersnow covered under andSection; 390.21, all for-hire motor carriers (includingthose currently exempt from the ICC's marking requirements) of propertyand passengers. Should any motor carrier subject to the FMCSRs be exemptfrom the marking requirements? The FHWA is particularly interested in commentsregarding the burden, if any, such a requirement would place on those carriersnot currently subject to the FHWA's marking requirements. We believe thatthe costs associated with an extension of the vehicle marking requirementwill be minimal, especially for those motor carriers already required tomark their vehicles (i.e., ICC authorized carriers and private motor carrierstransporting hazardous materials).The FHWA could allow ICC authorized motor carriers to comply with the markingrequirements of andSection; 390.21 through the display of their ICC (MC)number. The FHWA's Motor Carrier Census File contains both the ICC numberand the FHWA census number (DOT identification number) for each for-hiremotor carrier which is required by the ICC to display its identificationnumber. The FHWA believes that it should require the ICC authorized motorcarriers to appropriately mark their self-propelled commercial motor vehiclesbecause State enforcement personnel will then be able to enforce the markingrequirements if it is part of the FMCSRs and their State safety regulations.We believe that compliance with such a vehicle marking requirement willenhance overall compliance with applicable safety regulations, and willmake noncomplying motor carriers more accountable for their noncompliance.The FHWA believes that with the adoption of a requirement that all commercialmotor vehicles operating in interstate commerce be marked with either aDOT identification number or, in the case of ICC authorized carriers, anMC number, the need for individual State mandated motor carrier identificationnumbers may be duplicative of, or even detract from the Federal requirement.Thus, the FHWA recognizes that Federalism will be an issue in this proposal,and invites public comment on that issue.The FHWA has long been a proponent of and supported uniformity within themotor carrier industry. The agency has led the way with the advent of theMotor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) and the Commercial DriverLicense (CDL) program. It is hoped that, in the final analysis, the variousStates and other government agencies would recognize the DOT identificationnumber as a universal number to be used nationwide as a single motor carrieridentifier for a variety of purposes (e.g., International RegistrationProgram (IRP), fuel tax, highway use taxes). The universal use of a singleidentification number has the potential for saving both the States andthe motor carrier industry substantial sums of monies as well as simplifyingthe motor carrier identification process which could lead to other efficienciesand savings. The FHWA is interested in receiving comments from the variousStates, other government agencies, and the motor carrier industry, generally,concerning the concept of utilizing a single identification number on anational basis. Motor carriers subject to the ICC requirements should include,in their comments, data regarding the possible remarking of their vehicleswith a single identification number (the DOT identification number). TheFHWA is also interested in receiving comments on the appropriate size,shape, location and color of the marking from all motor carriers, regardlessof type of operation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Postcard Type Registration</ITAG>The FHWA's marking requirement was, in part, promulgated to identify themotor carrier population that is subject to the FMCSRs and to assist inmaintaining a current, up-to-date census file of all those motor carriers.As required by 49 CFR 385.21, Motor carrier identification report, eachmotor carrier of property and each for-hire motor carrier of passengers,who operates one or more commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce,must make a onetime filing with the FHWA on a Form MCS-150. Temporarily,Form MCS-137 is being used in lieu of the Form MCS-150. The FHWA is requestingcomments on the adequacy of a one-time filing to properly maintain sucha census file. The FHWA is considering the possible use of a postcard typeform for annual census purposes. Such a postcard type form would, it isenvisioned, replace the Forms MCS-137 and MCS-150 and be filed annuallyby each motor carrier subject to the FMCSRs. To minimize the paperworkburden, the form would be preprinted with current information, includingthe carrier identification number, and mailed to the business entitiesof record on the census each year in late December for return by January31 of the following year. Additional postcard forms would be made readilyavailable at convenient locations or upon request for new entities or asneeded by existing carriers. The following information would be reportedand or corrected:1. Motor carrier's name and U.S. DOT identification number.2. Motor carrier's principal place of business address and mailing address,if different.3. Motor carrier's telephone number.4. Name of the person completing the form.5. As of December 31, 19<T2>X</T2>, were you still operating as motor carrier in interstate commerce?(Yes) (No)6. Do you transport hazardous materials? (Yes) (No)7. Principal commodity transported?During the reporting year:8. Number of straight trucks (over 10,000 pounds GVWR) operated.9. Number of truck-tractors operated.10. Number of semi-trailers or full trailers operated.11. Number of buses (designed to transport 16 or more persons, includingthe driver) operated.12. Total number of miles operated in the United States. Bus<T2>XX</T2> Truck<T2>XX</T2>.The FHWA is interested in receiving comments from all interested partiesconcerning the concept of an annual postcard type filing by all motor carrierssubject to the FMCSRs and the concurrent discontinuance of Forms MCS-137and MCS-150. The FHWA is also seeking suggestions on how such a filingshould be structured.<ITAG tagnum="84">Marking of Rental Vehicles</ITAG>The TRALA has requested that the FHWA amend the marking requirements foundat 49 CFR 390.21 and thereby eliminate certain costly operational problemsassociated with the short-term rental of commercial motor vehicles to privateand for-hire motor carriers. The TRALA states:<ITAG tagnum="21">The nature of the truck rental industry makes the vehicle markingrules for short term commercial rental vehicles impractical for a varietyof reasons. Trucks and tractors that are available for rental to motorcarriers are, in fact, rented as frequently as 50-150 times per year. Becauseof this frequency, any vehicle marking would have to be under the controlof the truck rental company. To place the responsibility of vehicle markingon the customer could result in damage or disfigurement to the vehicle.Additionally, if the responsibility is placed on the customer, there willbe many inadvertent violations of the regulations due to misunderstandingor confusion on the part of the customer. . . . Nearly 15% of the companiesthat rent vehicles for short term use do not own or operate any trucksof their own. Because [they believe] they are not motor carriers, it isunlikely that they would have a census identification number.</ITAG>In view of the above, the TRALA proposes amending the marking rule as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">a. That upon application by a truck rental company, the DOT will issuea census identification number to the company provided it certifies tothe DOT that it will display its census number and its own vehicle identificationon the side of the vehicle and, it will, upon request of the DOT, providethe identity of any rental customer given the vehicle number and the timeand date of a reported driving infraction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. That the display of the rental company's own census identificationnumber and vehicle identification number will satisfy the vehicle markingrequirements of any motor carriers using rental vehicles in interstatecommerce.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">[c]. Because the rules do not apply to `the occasional transportationof personal property by individuals not for compensation nor in the furtheranceof a commercial enterprise,' we propose that the rules relating to themarking of Motor Vehicles specifically exclude those vehicles, availablefor rent by the public, that are primarily dedicated to just such transportation.</ITAG>The TRALA also proposes that the FHWA require the renting motor carrier'sname, address, and DOT identification number be placed on the rental agreementand that rental agreement be carried on the vehicle during the full termof the rental agreement. Further, it proposes that the rental company displayconspicuously, on the rental agreement, the following statement: ``THISLESSOR COOPERATES WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALSNATIONWIDE TO PROVIDE THE IDENTITY OF CUSTOMERS WHO OPERATE [THIS RENTAL]VEHICLE.''The TRALA contends regulatory uniformity, motor carrier and vehicle identification,and driver identification will be enhanced if its proposal is acted uponaffirmatively. The FHWA believes that the TRALA proposal warrants carefulconsideration.The FHWA envisions that if the proposed TRALA amendment is adopted, andSection;390.21would be modified in a manner similar to that requested by the TRALA. Inorder for a motor carrier to take advantage of the provision for a rentalvehicle and be exempted from placing its name, principal place of business,and DOT identification number on the sides of the self-propelled vehicle,the following conditions would need to be met:(1) The rental company's (lessor's) name, place of business, and DOT identificationnumber would have to be on both sides of the self-propelled motor vehicleas required by andSection;390.21.(2) The motor carrier's (lessee's) name, principal place of business, andDOT identification number, if issued to the carrier, would have to be containedin legible form on the vehicle's rental agreement, and such agreement wouldbe carried on board the vehicle during the full term of the rental agreement.(3) The rental company would agree to provide the DOT or its designee (Stateor local enforcement officials), upon request, the identity of any rentalcustomer who has rented a self-propelled commercial motor vehicle fromthe lessor, provided the DOT or its designee could provide the vehiclenumber(s), time, and place the vehicle was seen. The lease agreement wouldindicate, in a conspicuous manner, that the rental company cooperates withFederal, State and local enforcement officials in identifying the lesseeof the motor vehicle.If any of these conditions were not met, the motor carrier could not makeuse of this provision. If an enforcement official stopped the rental vehicleand any of the requirements were not met, the lessee motor carrier wouldbe in violation of andSection;390.21. If a rental vehicle were stopped andit did not contain the required motor carrier marking on the vehicle oron the rental agreement, it is possible that the enforcement official wouldissue a citation for a violation of the marking requirement or any vehicledefect to the lessor since that would be the only identification informationavailable.The FHWA is seeking comments on this TRALA proposal from interested parties,especially State law enforcement officials charged with the responsibilityof enforcing commercial motor carrier safety regulations. The FHWA is especiallyinterested in receiving responses to the following questions; however,commenters need not limit their responses to just these questions and issues.1. Authorized for-hire motor carriers that have entered into lease arrangementshave been, and currently are, required to identify the leased equipmentwith the name, or trade name, of the motor carrier and MC number underwhose authority the vehicle is being operated (49 CFR Part 1058). Has thisrequirement resulted in damage to the leased commercial motor vehicles?2. What damage has occurred to date to vehicles which were rented for shorttime periods and marked as currently required? Are there methods to repeatedlymark vehicles without damaging each vehicle? If so, what are the costsinvolved?3. What economic and/or paperwork burdens are being placed on the motorcarrier industry if the marking requirements remain unchanged? What burdenswould be placed on the industry if the marking requirements are amendedas proposed by the TRALA?4. What impact would the proposed TRALA amendment have upon the abilityof State enforcement officials to accurately identify the motor carrieractually operating the rental motor vehicle?5. If the proposed TRALA amendment is subsequently adopted, should it belimited only to those emergency situations where a motor carrier is supplementingits motor vehicle fleet? If so, should that period of time be limited to5 days, 10 days, 15 days, 30 days, or some other period?6. How many vehicle rentals each year could take advantage of the proposedTRALA amendment? Please provide these estimates for each of the time periodsset forth in question number 5.7. Could the amendment proposed by the TRALA be adequately enforced byState enforcement officials?8. Is there a way, such as requiring rental companies to cover their DOTidentification number when renting to noncommercial entities, to clearlyindicate to the State enforcement officials that a particular vehicle isengaged in a noncommercial movement?9. If adopted, should the proposed TRALA amendment be limited to specificoperations of the lessee and/or specific types of leasing companies?10. What experience, if any, have State enforcement officials had withobtaining information from rental companies regarding motor carriers thatrented commercial motor vehicles from those companies? Have the rentalcompanies been able to adequately identify the motor carrier and its exactgeographic location?11. What should the penalty be for any violation of the commercial motorvehicle marking requirements?<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 390</ITAG>Highway safety, Highway and roads, Marking requirements, Motor carriers,Motor vehicle safety.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.217, MotorCarrier Safety)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issued on: July 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Eugene R.
