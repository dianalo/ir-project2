The official of the banned Patriotic Union of Kurdistan told TheAssociated Press in a telephone interview that about 180 Iraqisoldiers were killed in the Dec. 24-25 attack on the bases, whichdot snow-covered Mount Sadir near Qala Diza.   The spokesman said 10 guerrillas _ known as Peshmergas, or``those who face death'' _ were wounded in the fighting, which hesaid was continuing in a diminished capacity. The official spokefrom a West European capital but asked that his name and locationbe kept secret for security reasons.   The official, who is known to The AP, said soldiers from theIraqi army's 24th battalion launched the offensive because ``theywere determined to capture those bases.'' He said one helicoptergunship was downed by the guerrillas.

The last big assault on the area was in September. Iraq haslaunched several concerted attacks against the Kurdish rebels sincethe August 1988 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq conflict.   Iraq's 3{ million Kurds have been fighting on and off for morethan a half-century for their own homeland.</TEXT></DOC>
