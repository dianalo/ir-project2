At the same time, President Bush directly warned the Iraqipeople that war might be the result of the showdown withIraqi leader Saddam Hussein. In a taped message to Iraq,aired last night on Iraqi TV, Mr. Bush declared that Iraq'sinvasion of Kuwait had put the nation &quot;on the brink of war.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Bush added: &quot;Perhaps your leaders do not appreciatethe strength of the forces united against them. Let me sayclearly there is no way Iraq can win. Ultimately, Iraq mustwithdraw from Kuwait. No one -- not the American people, notthis president -- wants war. But there are times when acountry, when all countries who value the principles ofsovereignty and independence, must stand against aggression.&quot;   Even as the military preparations and talk of militaryaction accelerated, though, Bush administration officialsinvolved in managing the crisis now believe that it will beNovember at the earliest before Saddam Hussein begins toconsider withdrawing from Kuwait, even if the trade embargoagainst Iraq and diplomatic pressure work well. And it couldbe December before that goal can be achieved through economicand diplomatic pressure, they believe.   The current U.S. strategy is to refrain from a militaryassault as long as the sanctions keep working -- even afterU.S. military forces reach full strength in November.   But officials concede privately that any signs of waveringon the embargo, or of willingness to compromise -- such asIran's recent verbal attacks on the U.S. forces in SaudiArabia -- could slow the process, as Saddam Hussein probesfor any fissures in the international effort that he canexploit. The longer the standoff stretches out, the harder itwill be to hold together the sprawling anti-Iraq coalition.   Thus, the U.S., France and the U.S.S.R. are discussing newUnited Nations sanctions to punish countries that break theembargo, especially by air. Presumably, these nations wouldface some of the sanctions that have been issued againstIraq. One possible penalty would be suspension of landingrights for their national airlines. The ambassadors of thefive permanent U.N. Security Council members met yesterday tobegin shaping further resolutions, and U.S. officials saidthere might be U.N. action as early this week to slappenalties on embargo-busters.   In just the past few days, five countries agreed to newmilitary deployments to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region tojoin more than 100,000 American soldiers and sailors alreadythere. And others have pledged billions of dollars in fundsfor the effort.   France, enraged after Iraqi troops broke into one of itsbuildings in Kuwait and seized diplomats Friday, agreed toadd a 4,000-man light-armored brigade with aircraft to itsforces in the Gulf. U.S. officials were puzzled by the Iraqimoves against the French diplomats, and others from Belgium,Canada and the Netherlands, which they regard as a majormiscalculation that only bolstered the anti-Iraq coalition.   The fallout from the raids on diplomatic premises isbecoming more widespread. The U.N. Security Council yesterdayunanimously condemned the incursions, the Soviet Unioncriticized them and Italy expelled some employees of theIraqi embassy there.   In moves that were in the works even before the Iraqimoves against diplomatic buildings in Kuwait, Britain said itwould dispatch a 6,000-man armored brigade and a thirdsquadron of fighter jets to the Persian Gulf. Canada andItaly each announced the deployment to the Gulf of theirfirst jet fighter squadrons. Egypt said it is ready to sendup to two divisions of ground troops and Syria has pledged adivision of at least 10,000 men with roughly 300 tanks.   In addition to the political importance of the French andBritish decision to send additional forces, U.S. militaryofficials also welcomed the moves for more practical reasons.Delays by Syria and Egypt in sending promised tanks andsoldiers have concerned U.S. commanders for several weeks,and they hope to use European forces to plug certain holes inthe defensive barrier in northern Saudi Arabia.   West Germany, while not sending combat forces, is handingover to the U.S. about $1 billion of new military gear,including military vehicles, 60 special tanks equipped toresist chemical and nuclear attack, combat-support andcommunications equipment.   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also pledged about $1billion in support for Egypt, Turkey and Jordan, bringing theGerman total to $2 billion. The European Community is alsoexpected to announce shortly a financial commitmentapproaching $2 billion.   Mr. Kohl said &quot;I regret very much&quot; that Germany'sconstitution doesn't permit it to send troops to the Gulf. Hepledged to try to change that law in early 1991, afterGermany is reunited and has held elections.   &quot;The buildup is still going on. It's going on for thepurposes the president described,&quot; said Brent Scowcroft,President Bush's national security adviser, on CBS News's&quot;Face the Nation&quot; yesterday. He added: &quot;We want {SaddamHussein} to know we are serious.&quot;   In addition, Secretary of State James Baker claimed thatall eight Arab and European governments he called on during a10-day, 24,000-mile search for support that ended over theweekend had signed onto the hard-line U.S. stand. Thatposture rules out any compromise with Iraq on the U.N.resolutions that demand unconditional withdrawal from Kuwaitand restoration of the Kuwaiti government that was ousted byIraq's Aug. 2 invasion.   &quot;We talked about the preference for a peaceful andpolitical solution,&quot; an exhausted Mr. Baker told reporters inBonn, West Germany, the final stop on his tour. &quot;But we haveto understand from the very beginning what we mean by that.We do not mean walking away from, watering down, or in anyway diminishing the scope and extent of the United NationsSecurity Council Resolutions. So, a sine qua non is that Iraqwithdraw, and that the legitimate government of Kuwait berestored.&quot;   Since Sept. 5, Mr. Baker has crisscrossed three continentsto meet with the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Egypt,Syria, the Soviet Union, Italy, West Germany, North AtlanticTreaty Organization and the EC, as well as the exiled Kuwaitileadership.   The developments left the administration feeling upbeat.But political criticism at home could still cause the WhiteHouse trouble. For one thing, all the new military forcesbeing sent by other countries are relatively small, leavingthe U.S. still the major country at risk there.   Also, it's becoming clearer that the administration,distracted by European and Soviet matters, wasn't tough onIraq until after the invasion, and may have missed a chanceto help head it off.   In particular, a transcript of a crucial meeting thatApril Glaspie, U.S. ambassador to Iraq, held with SaddamHussein just before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait indicatesthat she failed to clearly warn Iraq that the U.S. wouldstrongly oppose an invasion. The transcript was released byIraq, but U.S. officials haven't questioned its accuracy.   But at a news conference in Bonn Saturday night, Mr. Bakerrefused to discuss the Glaspie affair, citing theconfidentiality of diplomatic communications.   Instead, he lashed out at critics of her performance,calling her &quot;a dedicated public servant who has done a finejob&quot; and saying it is &quot;ludicrous to somehow suggest that theUnited States contributed to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.&quot;   In his address to the Iraqi people, meanwhile, Mr. Bushattempted to place the blame for current high tensionssecurely on the shoulders of Saddam Hussein, quoting back theIraqi leader's own words from a 1988 speech in which hedeclared that no Arab nation had the right to occupy another.In that speech, the Iraqi leader also declared that &quot;if Iraqshould become intoxicated by its power and move to overwhelmanother Arab state, the Arabs would be right to deploy theirarmies to check it.&quot;   Mr. Bush said that war isn't &quot;inevitable,&quot; but added that&quot;when conflict is thrust upon us, there is no nation on Earthwith greater resolve or stronger steadiness of purpose.&quot;   Iraqi TV followed Mr. Bush's speech with a longercommentary of its own saying that many of Mr. Bush's remarksabout the evolution of the current crisis were lies and thathe wants to be &quot;dictator of the whole world.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
