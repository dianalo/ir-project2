<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-67-0099 </DOCNO><TEXT>A survey is presented of X-ray diagnostic methods and techniques and possibilitiesof their further development. Promising methods include direct imagingusing digital radiography. In connection with computer technology thesemethods achieve higher resolution. The storage of obtained images inthe computer memory will allow automated processing and evaluation andthe use of expert systems. Development is expected to take place especiallyin computerized tomography using magnetic resonance, and positron computedtomography and other non-radioactive diagnostic methods.
