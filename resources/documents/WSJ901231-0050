But they hopedthe problems would go away.   Lacop, as it is known, had for years appeared on anational watch list of shaky insurers. Various states hadbarred it from doing business within their borders. But itwas up to Pennsylvania, Lacop's home state, to decide whetherto shut it down. And Pennsylvania waited.   Lacop assured state officials this past July that it soonplanned to sell its policies to another insurer and get outof the business. Officials decided to give Lacop more timeeven though its bank accounts were overdrawn by $2.8 million.Lacop wrote millions of dollars in new policies as the stateheld back.   This fall, Lacop gradually stopped paying most claims.First a trickle and then a torrent of calls came into theinsurance department from angry policyholders and bankscomplaining about missed payments and bounced checks. In lateOctober, the state suspended all operations at Lacop, andregulators are now seeking to have the company declaredinsolvent by a state court.   State insurance Commissioner Constance Foster, anenergetic official who has built up a department that haddeclined for years, says she remains astounded by Lacop'sdemise. &quot;I'll tell you frankly, to this day I don't know howthis company became insolvent.&quot; The company disputes thenotion that it is actually insolvent, and says it plans tochallenge the state in court.   The Lacop case illustrates several problems with the wayinsurance companies are regulated in this country. Though itreaches not only across state lines but around the globe,insurance is governed by a patchwork of local regulation thatis sustained by state and industry lobbying. So diffuse isthe current system that state regulators refer to companiesheadquartered in other states as &quot;foreign.&quot;   There is increasing concern that the business isoutstripping the ability of laws, regulators, and accountingrules to guide it. The business itself is riskier than ever.Property and casualty carriers, who once concentrated on themore predictable hazards of theft and fire, now alsounderwrite far riskier lines such as product liability andfinancial guaranties. Life insurers, acting much like banks,are selling investments at narrowing profits backed in somecases by worrisome assets. And hundreds of policy writers useoffshore companies to &quot;reinsure&quot; their own risks.   Up against this are state insurance departments, whoseabilities and resources vary widely. While New York spentmore than $50 million to monitor the $31 billion in policieswritten there last year, Pennsylvania spent only $11 millionto regulate the $27 billion of policies written in thatstate. New York's insurance commission has 821 staffers,while Pennsylvania's has but 263. Pennsylvania has only sevenfinancial analysts and 46 field examiners to inspect theroughly 400 insurance companies headquartered there and themore than 1,000 other companies doing business in the state.The small staff conducted about 200 examinations this year.   &quot;I guess that you can always use more {resources}, but Ifeel that we have been very kindly treated&quot; by the statebudget, Commissioner Foster says.   While no one has questioned the integrity or thecommitment of Pennsylvania's department, that isn't so insome other states. Two commissioners were indicted earlierthis year for alleged bribe-taking in unrelated incidents.Critics say many states still jockey for narrow and parochialinterests at the expense of a coordinated, national approachto policing insurers. And more than a century of closeconnections between the industry and its government overseerspersists, even though for years many regulators themselveshave called for greater regulatory independence.   &quot;The problem with state regulation is that in many casesit continues to function in the era of the quill pen,&quot;complains Rep. John Dingell, the Michigan Democrat whoseOversight and Investigations subcommittee has beenresearching the insurance business for over a year. Many inthe industry believe Rep. Dingell will next year proposefederal legislation for insurance regulation.   Proponents argue that the current regulatory structure cancatch up with the modern realities of insurance. The systemis slowly strengthening its oversight of companies' financialconditions. &quot;We have accomplished more in the last year onsolvency regulation than we have in the last 20 yearscombined,&quot; says James Long, North Carolina insurancecommissioner and president of the National Association ofInsurance Commissioners, which coordinates state regulation.   But, for all their efforts, the states still have far togo. When an insurer falls ill, its home state is expected byother states to monitor -- and, if need be, cut off -- thebusiness. Theoretically, consumers across the country areequally protected. In practice, 50 doctors may minister tothe one patient, enforcing different laws with widely varyingvigilance. The Pennsylvania department is a case in point.   The agency was in disarray when Mrs. Foster took over inJanuary 1987, inside and outside observers contend. Eightcommissioners had come and gone in as many years. Staffinghad dropped by about 30% in the preceding decade. And a majorinsolvency was breaking on the scene.   Mutual Fire, Marine andamp; Inland Insurance Co. had recentlyfailed and been taken over by the department. Its assetstrailed its liabilities by about $400 million, making it thelargest insurance failure in Pennsylvania history. Mrs.Foster had little experience in this kind of thing herself,having spent most of her time as a Philadelphia attorneysuing insurance companies in workers' compensation cases.Still, she says, it was immediately apparent that thedepartment wasn't up to its regulatory responsibilities.   &quot;It was clear that our solvency net was full of holes,&quot;she says. Among other things, she was bothered by the sightof department financial analysts checking company numberswith hand calculators. There was hardly a computer in sight.   Commissioner Foster has pushed staff training and shakenup the organization chart. She has increased the staff by 33%and the budget by 43%. And she draws praise from some othercommissioners. &quot;Connie seems to be able to filter through allthe technical stuff and understand what's needed for themarketplace,&quot; says Elaine McReynolds, Tennessee's insurancecommissioner.   For her part, Mrs. Foster says, &quot;I think we have usedevery financial and human resource to our fullest potentialin the last four years. We couldn't have done more. But I dothink there are more improvements we can make.&quot;   Penny-pinching remains a way of life in the department.The commissioner recently spent days debating the purchase ofa $25,000 machine to improve the flow of calls to thecomplaints department.   Pennsylvania's insurance outlays are proportionately amongthe lowest of major states. Moreover, the departmentroutinely takes in more in license fees and fines than itspends -- resulting in a &quot;profit&quot; to the state of $4 millionin the latest fiscal year. And, like all states, Pennsylvaniaalso collects taxes on insurance premiums that dwarfregulatory spending. Those amounted to about $190 million inthe last fiscal year, ended June 30.   Most of Commissioner Foster's improvements and addedpersonnel have been in politically attractive areas such asrate monitoring and consumer complaint services.   Insurance regulation is more than financial analysis. In anondescript brick high-rise a few blocks down from thecapital building in Harrisburg, rows of employees field callsfrom distressed consumers while dozens of actuaries and ratespecialists scrutinize over 14,000 rate filings and over40,000 policy forms a year.   Under Gov. Robert Casey, the Democrat who appointedCommissioner Foster, Pennsylvania has undertaken some majorconsumer-oriented initiatives, particularly in automobileinsurance, where it has compelled insurers to disregard apolicyholder's sex in setting rates and to reduce rates inreturn for some restructuring of certain mandatory coverage.   As the Lacop case shows, attention to company analysis andsolvency was almost lost in the battles over auto rates andother issues.   About every three or four years, regulators visitinsurance companies in Pennsylvania and around the country todo an on-site audit of the books. It's a time consumingprocess that takes months and even years to complete. Andcritics contend that these so-called examinations are oftenso late as to be useless. The state's examination of Lacopfor the year 1987, for example, still isn't finished.   Insurers do have to voluntarily report a raft of financialdata to the state every year, and that data is fed into acomputer run by the national insurance commissioners' group.In fact, as the insurance business becomes more complex,regulators are relying more on computers than increasedmanpower to monitor insurers's health.   Each year, the computer identifies companies that may bein financial trouble so that states, and particularly theirhome state, can pay closer attention. Beginning in themid-1980s, the computer picked out Lacop as a troubledinsurer.   Life Assurance Co. of Pennsylvania is a 33-year-old,closely-held company that is part of the real estate andinsurance holdings of Chicago businessman Richard Fanslow.Lacop specialized in so-called credit life policies, whichpromised to keep up payments on car and consumer loans evenif the borrower should die or be disabled. A small company,it had total capital of but $7.8 million as of June 30. Thenation's largest life insurer, Prudential Life Insurance Co.of America, has more than $5 billion in capital.   James Blair, president of Lacop, declines to discuss itsdealings with regulators, saying it is contesting a number ofinsurance department actions in court.   The first regulatory action against Lacop came more than ayear ago, when Ohio's insurance department limited thepremiums Lacop could write there. In October 1989, theIllinois department banned the company altogether. So didTennessee in December of that year. And last April,California took the same step, alleging that the company was&quot;conducting its business and affairs in a manner hazardous toits policyholders, creditors, and the public.&quot; Marylandlifted the company's license in July.   Yet, most states held to tradition, counting on Lacop'shome regulators in Pennsylvania to take the lead. WestVirginia, one of Lacop's most active markets, awaited actionfrom Pennsylvania while the company took in $11.4 millionfrom West Virginia residents in the year and a half leadingto June 30. &quot;We rely on the regulatory strength and abilityof the insurance company's home state; that's all we can do,&quot;says John Collins, director of the West Virginia insurancedepartment's Financial Conditions Division. He notes that heand two financial analysts must look after the 1,200companies licensed to do business in the state.   By June 30, Lacop's bank accounts were overdrawn by $2.8million. Assets exceeded liabilities only because another ofMr. Fanslow's businesses transferred the deed on an $8.5million piece of property to Lacop.   Yet Pennsylvania refused to take action -- in part,regulators say, because they were misled by companyofficials, and in part because they say shutting an insurerdown is such a drastic and difficult step.   By summer, state and Lacop officials were in almost dailycontact. State officials failed to appreciate the seriousnessof the company's cash shortage. Moreover, they were focusedon Lacop's assurances in July that it was getting out of theinsurance business altogether. &quot;I remember breathing a sighof relief when they told us that and thinking that wewouldn't have to take harsher action,&quot; recalls KennethWolensky, the 28-year-old director of the department's Bureauof Licensing and Financial Analysis.   Harsher action means taking an insurer to court andproving -- generally against the company's protests -- thatit is insolvent, or that its liabilities exceed its assets.Commissioner Foster says the cases can be tough to prove. Andwhen the state wins, it then has the burdensome job of takingcontrol of the insurer and liquidating it.   &quot;We thought that we could dismember the company, and thatthere were books of business within Lacop that were veryattractive, and that those books of business could be soldoff with no impact at all on the consumers,&quot; CommissionerFoster says. &quot;Once you put a book of life insurance intoliquidation, there are some very big legal questions aboutwhat's going to happen to the holders of whole life{policies}, and that was something we were trying to avoid.&quot;   It seemed at first that there might be buyers for Lacop'sbusiness. Negotiations with an undisclosed party droned onthrough August and into September, and the department keptits hopes up.   But then, in about mid-September, calls began tricklinginto the state that Lacop claims weren't being paid and thenthat claim checks were bouncing. The department paid littleattention. Lacop, according to state officials, explainedcomplaints away, first as a processing problem and then as atemporary cash glitch that would soon be covered by a line ofcredit.   &quot;We were misled,&quot; the commissioner says now.   On October 4, Lacop voluntarily stopped writing newbusiness, again quelling state concerns. Not until mid-monthdid the state realize the full gravity of the cash problem.On Oct. 18 it issued an order officially suspending thecompany's business, and four days later it sent an examinerinto the company's offices. But it was too late. RonaldChronister, deputy insurance commissioner for companyregulation, says the state had for months planned to send ateam of examiners into Lacop, but somehow &quot;other prioritiesjust interceded.&quot;   In Pennsylvania's mind, Lacop's days of independentoperation were over. Nearly half a decade after the firstwarnings signs from regulators' computers, CommissionerFoster, on Nov. 23, asked the Commonwealth Court ofPennsylvania in Harrisburg to declare Lacop insolvent. Lacopis disputing that assertion, but it declines to disclose itsreasons. A court hearing is scheduled for early January.   Across the country, the number of insolvencies has jumpedto a record 44 last year from less than five per year earlierin the decade, renewing calls for some form of federaloversight of insurance.   State oversight of the insurance industry dates back to1868, when the U.S. Supreme Court concluded in a case calledPaul vs. Virginia that insurance wasn't a form of commerceand therefore was exempt from federal control. &quot;A historicalquirk,&quot; one scholar has called the ruling. The high courtoverturned Paul vs. Virginia in 1944. But the industry andits state government allies, in a lobbying tour de force,swiftly convinced Congress to pass the 1945 McCarran-FergusonAct, once again exempting insurance from federal control,including antitrust laws. The act &quot;violates the mostfundamental rights of citizens and economic good sense,&quot; saysSen. Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat who has conducted anumber of campaigns to rescind McCarran-Ferguson.   While the industry and the individual states have beatenback such attempts before, both groups feel under pressurenow. In response, the state commissioners' group, NAIC, isworking to get the 50 states to adopt uniform standards ofregulation, such as requiring that all insurers get anoutside auditor to sign off on their annual statement offinancial health. Currently, only 15 states, includingPennsylvania, require such an audit.   The NAIC this year began a campaign to certify stateinsurance departments. Two of the best state departments, NewYork and Florida, entered the process. Both were certified,but NAIC officials concede that many states would flunk iftested. Nor has the NAIC adopted any punishment for failureto attain certification, asserting instead that insurancebuyers themselves will shun companies based in states thatdon't make the grade.   State politics in many cases can play as big a role astheories of insurance regulation and sound accountingpractices. California Assemblyman Patrick Johnston says heran into a buzz saw this summer when he proposed limitinginsurance company junk-bond holdings to 20% of assets. Mr.Johnston, who is chairman of the assembly's Finance andInsurance Committee, says he hadn't reckoned on the lobbyingpowers of Los Angeles-based First Executive Corp., a majorholder of junk bonds. His bill was sunk by his own committee.&quot;It wasn't even close,&quot; he says. First Executive has declinedto comment on the assembly vote.   The regulatory process itself is infused with industryofficials and lobbyists at all levels. NAIC meetings oftenare filled with insurance executives, known sometimes as &quot;thegreenies&quot; because of the registration tags they must wear. Ata conference in Baltimore earlier this year, industryrepresentatives outnumbered state officials more than six toone. Each NAIC committee has an industry advisory group,whose members sit side by side with their regulators,cajoling and arguing about the detailed rules andrequirements that are supposed to guide the industry.   At their worst, industry ties to regulators have led toallegations of corruption. According to federal prosecutors,Louisiana insurance Commissioner Douglas Green letnow-insolvent Champion Insurance Co. stay in business,despite widespread complaints that the insurer wasn't payingclaims, after he had received $150,000 in campaigncontributions from interests related to the company.   This June, a federal grand jury in New Orleans charged Mr.Green with mail fraud, money laundering and conspiracy. Hewas also indicted in Baton Rouge in July by a state grandjury on charges of public bribery in the same matter. Througha spokeswoman, Mr. Green denies the charges, which he saysare politically motivated.   Former Wyoming insurance Commissioner Gordon W. Taylor Jr.was indicted earlier this year on three federal counts ofalleged bribe-taking in connection with companies under hisdepartment's surveillance. Mr. Taylor recently pleaded guiltyin federal court in Casper, Wyo., to one of the charges andis awaiting sentencing.   Meanwhile in Pennsylvania, lessons are being learned,Commissioner Foster says. &quot;Next time we will be lessaccepting of what the company has to say,&quot; she asserts. Thestate has been working for two years on a new computer systemof its own to better target troubled insurers. It plans tocut back on its on-site examinations of clearly healthycompanies to concentrate more resources on sick ones.   Many of the more aggressive state insurance commissionsare taking similar steps. But other states lag far behind.Commissioner Foster says she reluctantly would welcomefederal guidelines for states to follow. &quot;I think there is acrying need for minimum standards,&quot; she says. Bettermonitoring of company &quot;solvency is the door through whichfederal regulation will walk. Some form of it is inevitable.&quot;   ---     Top Ten Insurance States -- And Their Regulators                                                                                                                          JULY 1989-    1989           JUNE 1990       REGULATORY    STATEWIDE      DEPARTMENT      SPENDING AS    PREMIUMS       BUDGET          A PERCENT OF   (In billions)  (In millions)   TOTAL PREMIUMS     STAFF                                                                                                        California      $54.59         $60.4            0.11%             813                                                                                                        New York       30.98          54.2            0.17              812                                                                                                        Florida       28.24          39.0            0.13              651                                                                                                        Pennsylvania       27.23          11.3            0.04              263 Texas       27.03          50.7            0.18            1,299                                                                                                        Ohio       16.74          11.8            0.07              185                                                                                                        North Carolina       11.96          18.7            0.16              356                                                                                                        Indiana       11.82           3.3            0.02               99                                                                                                        Connecticut        9.77           4.3            0.04               76                                                                                                        Georgia        9.51           6.3            0.07              131                                                                                                          Source: National Association of InsuranceCommissioners/State Reports/WSJ</TEXT></DOC>
