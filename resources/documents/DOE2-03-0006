The paper describes a method how to obtain this, by optimizationof a parameter of amplification, KQ, in the electrical control of thepower plant. A model of the wind power plant and the optimizing algorithmhave been designed and implemented in the simulation language Simnon.The optimization algorithm works in the following way. Add a test signalto KQ so that a power variation is obtained. Estimate the cross-covariancebetween the test signal and the power variation. The result of the estimationis then used to adjust KQ to its optimum.</TEXT></DOC>
