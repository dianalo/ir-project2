Several other units of Greyhound's parent company, GLIHolding Co. were included in the bankruptcy petition. Thefiling was made with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for theSouthern District of Texas in Brownsville, Texas, home ofEagle Bus Manufacturing Co., one of GLI subsidiariesinvolved.</LP><TEXT>   In addition to missing a $9.8 million interest payment onits 13% senior notes due in 1995, as of June 1, Greyhound wasbehind on about $10 million in lease payments on certainbuses and properties.   J. Michael Doyle, senior vice president and chieffinancial officer, said the company filed for bankruptcy --seeking protection from creditors while working out a plan torepay debt -- because creditors involved in those leases werethreatening to take possession of a number of buses. Roughlytwo-thirds of the company's 3,800 buses are leased, but Mr.Doyle declined to say how many were in jeopardy.   &quot;The system has much more value to everybody as anoperating unit and we couldn't afford to let a lot of assetsget out of the system,&quot; Mr. Doyle said.   Greyhound, which has sustained huge losses as a result ofa three-month-long strike by the Amalgamated Transit Union,said the action was necessary to ensure that it will be ableto serve its full network during the busy summer travelseason. A company spokesman said that under Chapter 11,Greyhound will continue to serve all locations on itsnetwork.   The company also said that the bankruptcy court lateyesterday gave it permission to honor tickets alreadypurchased for future travel.   In a memo to employees, Greyhound Chairman Fred Curreycalled the Chapter 11 filing &quot;a result of a one-time badevent.&quot;   &quot;That event was not the strike, but was the strike-relatedviolence, which was unlawful,&quot; Mr. Currey said. &quot;It causedyour company to spend over $50 million out of pocket onsecurity forces to protect customers and employees, and forlawyers to get court action to restrain the unlawfulactivity.   &quot;Fortunately, most of those expenses are behind us,&quot; Mr.Currey also said in the memo. &quot;The Chapter 11 proceedingswill enable us to recapitalize so that we can fulfill theobjective of making Greyhound Lines into the growingcustomer-focused business that it must be to fulfill itspotential.&quot;   Mr. Doyle said Greyhound is already seekingdebtor-in-possession loans from several sources and &quot;expectsto be successful&quot; in that effort. He declined to say how muchadditional capital Greyhound now is seeking but previouslythe bus company had indicated that it needed about $35million for working capital and other purposes.   The Chapter 11 filing comes just two weeks after Greyhoundoffered to redeem about $191 million in face amount of debtfor about $86 million in cash. Amid grumbling from holders ofthe Greyhound notes, the company had yet to find a source tofinance the tender offer although Mr. Doyle said negotiationshad been progressing. He said he was uncertain of the statusof the tender offer as a result of the Chapter 11 filing.   ATU officials, who recently asked Greyhound to discuss apossible employee buy-out, were caught off-guard by theChapter 11 filing. Edward Strait, president of theAmalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, the ATU'sbargaining unit, said the filing would make such a buy-outmore difficult.   He denied the company's claims that strike violence hadforced it into bankruptcy. &quot;We wanted people punished for theviolence,&quot; he said. &quot;They negotiated us into a strike. Ithink this has been planned. The company wants to get rid ofthe union.&quot;   Other union officials welcomed the company's action. &quot;Wemight get rid of Fred Currey and reorganize this thing,&quot; saidEdward Vezza, president of the ATU's Philadelphia local. &quot;Wecould have had a good contract for all the money he spenttrying to break this union.&quot;   Mr. Currey led a group of Dallas investors that launched a$270 million leveraged buy-out of Greyhound Lines in 1987from its former parent company, the recently renamedGreyhound Dial Corp. The group acquired the assets of itsmajor competitor, Trailways Corp., the same year for $80million. At the end of 1989, the closely held concern stillhad about $359 million in debt on its books, largely as aresult of those leveraged buy-outs.   Although Mr. Currey attempted to rally employees behindhis plans to revamp Greyhound, his efforts crumbled amidbitterness over the company's contract offer earlier thisyear. The ATU strike began March 2 and was followed bywidespread violence as the company hired permanentreplacement drivers to replace strikers. Such violenceeventually tapered off but not before Greyhound recorded a$55.8 million loss for the first quarter, compared with ayear-earlier $14.4 million loss.   A regional office of the National Labor Relations Boardrecently issued a complaint alleging that the strike is anunfair labor practices walkout. If the finding is upheld, thecompany says it could ultimately be forced to rehire uniondrivers and be liable for as much $800 million in back pay tostrikers.   Greyhound officials said the NLRB proceedings willcontinue despite the Chapter 11 filing.</TEXT></DOC>
