ProIcon extends SNOBOL4 with goal-directed expressionevaluation, higher-level string-scanning functions,co-expressions, and other math and Macintosh-oriented functions.andO;It is a powerful environment in which defining statements becomethe code for standalone applications.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Catspaw Inc.
