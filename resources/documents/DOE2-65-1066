This instabilityleads, if developed, to a separation of the two currents in space - aperiodic structure orthogonal to the beam axis is finally obtained. Incontrast to previous results by Ivanov, the maximal growth rate for theinstability is shown to occur at a finite wavelength. Furthermore, thesegrowth rates are much lower than calculated before. The influence ofvacuum contributions is also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
