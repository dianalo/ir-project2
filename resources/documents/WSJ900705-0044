Ms. Taylor, a planning director for the London agency,recalls the would-be client grilled her hard: &quot;Will you stillbe our team in six months' time? Are you going to get fed upand leave?&quot; Unconvinced, the British manufacturer took itsbusiness elsewhere.</LP><TEXT>   A few weeks later, Ms. Taylor and six colleagues quit toform their own shop. It was the biggest defection ever fromBritain's largest and most award-winning agency.   The breakaway pummeled the parent's share price, becauseinvestors feared possible client losses and a wider exodusfrom an agency created by company founders Maurice andCharles Saatchi in 1970. Saatchi pooh-poohed the defectors asdisgruntled unknowns, then sued them to dissuade others andrecover everything from corporate marker pens to old newsclippings.   A major walkout from the heart of the empire marked asymbolic turning point for Saatchi, the world's biggestadvertising business until a flawed diversification led tored ink and a boardroom upheaval in recent months. TheCharlotte Street agency, informally known by its address, nolonger can escape the parent's well-known ills.   &quot;In this town, the name Saatchi is now associated withfailure. Advertising is basically about selling confidence,&quot;says Tim Delaney, creative director at Leagas Delaney, asmaller rival. The Charlotte Street attitude of &quot;`we can dono wrong, we are the world conquerors' is gone.&quot;   The Saatchi agency is snaring fewer clients. It hastumbled to seventh place in the U.K. ad-agency new-businessrankings so far in 1990, after leading the pack for the pastthree years. Amid Britain's worst ad downturn in a decade,Charlotte Street lost several medium-sized clients earlierthis year, while many remaining ones (mostly hard-hitretailers) are slashing their ad budgets.   And staff morale has begun to sag under a round oflayoffs, deferred pay raises and other cost-cutting measuresdictated by the harsher business climate and the parent'sburdensome debt.   Saatchi executives insist Charlotte Street's powerfulcreative reputation remains unscathed and predict solidprofits this year for its overall U.K. advertising andmarketing-services operation, which barely broke even in thefirst fiscal half.   &quot;I hope we will be on top&quot; in new-business rankings byyear end, says agency Managing Director Paul Bainsfair. Withtypical Saatchi bravado, he corrects himself: &quot;I am sure wewill be No. 1.&quot; Even if &quot;Charlotte Street doesn't win theSuper Bowl,&quot; Mr. Bainsfair goes on, &quot;it doesn't mean the endof the dynasty.&quot;   But the jewel in Saatchi's crown may be all that's leftafter dismemberment of the far-flung enterprise. Someindustry analysts think that to repay debt, the company willshed everything but the international ad network headed bythe flagship agency -- and then go private by letting thedisillusioned Saatchi brothers buy it back. That &quot;is aperfectly reasonable scenario,&quot; says an individual close toSaatchi. &quot;They would like to go back to running an agencyagain . . . like they used to do.&quot; Saatchi officials haven'truled out the possibility of a future disposal of one of thetwo international ad networks.   Charlotte Street grew out of an agency the youthful IraqiJewish brothers launched with #25,000 of borrowed capital,tough creative standards, systematic client poaching -- and aknack for well-timed publicity. &quot;The clients for whom theSaatchis have done the best job for are Saatchi andamp; Saatchi,&quot;remarks Chris Jones, J. Walter Thompson's managing directorin Britain and an ex-Saatchi man.   The agency bred fierce, almost familial loyalty, based on&quot;Saatchism&quot; -- a culture of success and the cocky belief thatnothing is impossible. Maurice Saatchi once tried (butfailed) to land Black andamp; Decker Corp.'s Continental Europeaccount by offering to move Saatchi's Paris operation toLyons in order to serve the U.S. power tool maker's Europeanoffice there.   The brothers ran their rapidly expanding business for morethan a decade from Charlotte Street's sixth, top floor.There, temperamental Charles often tossed phones and chairsat Maurice during shouting matches audible below. (Bothdeclined to be interviewed for this article.) Corporateheadquarters moved several blocks away in 1986, after adizzying string of U.S. acquisitions had realized the pair'sglobal ambitions.   But close ties linger between the agency and the brothers.Reclusive and eccentric Charles Saatchi, despite hispreoccupation with a bulky contemporary art collection, stillroutinely calls to suggest music for commercials or critiquecampaigns. Charlotte Street initially kept its favored-childstatus even when the parent company's earnings tumbled lastyear and Chairman Maurice Saatchi relinquished thechief-executive-officer role. Although Saatchi reduced itsworld-wide staff by some 800 during 1989, the agency escapedlayoffs at that time.   Maurice Saatchi, urged by Saatchi's new Chief ExecutiveRobert Louis-Dreyfus, resumed wooing potential and currentCharlotte Street clients this spring -- something he rarelydid during the company's takeover spree.   In any case, his efforts may not suffice. The downturn inCharlotte Street's new business partly mirrors advertisers'skittishness about turmoil at the parent company. &quot;Thisfeeling that Saatchi might be a slightly precarious bet hasto come through to the new-business clients,&quot; a senior agencyofficial concedes.   Peter Church, advertising manager at Abbey National BankPLC, concurs. &quot;Heavy media coverage of Saatchi's {corporate}situation at the moment&quot; may persuade some advertisers &quot;tonot commit themselves to a new agency.&quot; The U.K. bankrecently stopped using Charlotte Street for its #2.5 million($4.4 million) checking-account campaign after employing theagency for four years. &quot;We felt we hadn't gotten the rightcreative idea,&quot; Mr. Church says, adding: &quot;It may well be thatthey have hit the crest of the wave.&quot;   A new corporate name might end client confusion betweenthe still-successful agency and its ailing parent, manyCharlotte Street staffers believe. They have even dreamed upsome alternatives: Chas. andamp; Mo Inc. or Titanic EnterprisesInc. The Saatchi brothers aren't amused. &quot;They're used to it{the name} and don't want to change it&quot; because they &quot;spent20 years building up a company&quot; called Saatchi andamp; Saatchi,explains the individual with Saatchi ties.   At the same time, the corporate and industry crunch now isforcing retrenchment at the flagship agency. Mr.Louis-Dreyfus has been nicknamed &quot;Jaws&quot; for effectivelyfreezing most equipment purchases companywide. &quot;You've gotfewer tools to do your business with,&quot; complains a managerwho recently quit Charlotte Street, primarily because of suchspending restrictions.   The Saatchi agency laid off 30 of its roughly 900 staffersin February -- the first ever. More layoffs loom, workersfear. Further job cuts aren't expected &quot;at the moment,&quot; saysMr. Bainsfair, the managing director. But &quot;the great $64,000question is how long will this {downturn} go on for?&quot; Theagency may skip this year's Christmas bonus, typically amonth's pay, And its management is cracking down on certaincommon ad-industry practices, offering fewer company cars andbanning expense-account staff lunches.   Around the corner from the agency's squat gray building, aFrench brasserie feels the pinch. A year ago, &quot;we used tohave dozens and dozens of Saatchi people in here from earlyafternoon until early evening drinking champagne,&quot; recallsZazou manager Nick Stern. The Saatchi people &quot;now are alleating sandwiches at their desks,&quot; he sighs.   The Saatchi setbacks have failed to completely diminishthe flagship agency's characteristic self-assurance, however.It recently ran a secretarial recruiting ad that promisedapplicants they would &quot;be working at the most successfuladvertising agency in the known universe.&quot;   &quot;There is still a hell of an atmosphere&quot; here, argues thesenior agency official. Even with fewer people, &quot;the peoplehere are very Saatchi. We still do great advertising.&quot;   ---   Ad Notes. . . .                                                                                                          NEW ACCOUNT: Goldberg Moser O'Neill will handle thenational launch of Wings, a personal learning system byIntelligy Corp. The win, estimated at more than $5 million,is the first for the former Chiat/Day/Mojo San Franciscooffice since its management buy-out.                                                                                                          ALLY COMPENSATION PLAN: Ally andamp; Gargano, hoping to attractthe attention of potential car clients, introduced a gimmickynew compensation for car makers. The new system would involvepaying Ally primarily in cash but partly in cars. It alsowould involve a sliding commission based on sales goals; ifsales fell short of goals, Ally would be paid less cash andmore cars. Bill Luceno, chief executive, said the plan aimsto &quot;provide a little incentive for somebody to come on in andtalk to us.&quot; And what happens to the cars? &quot;We'll cross thatbridge when we come to it.&quot;                                                                                                          ADS MODIFIED: PepsiCo and Nestle's Stouffer Foods unitmodified campaigns in response to inquiries by the NationalAdvertising Division of the Council of Better BusinessBureaus.
