 The savings in repair time and costs can bedramatic.andM;&quot;Companies spend an awful lot of money supporting their personal computers,&quot;says Bob Bowers, president of Magna Enterprises, a computer training andconsulting firm in Ellicott City, Md.andP;  &quot;More than 1,500 people have taken ourcourse on maintaining and troubleshooting PCs,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;And at least 80%of them are looking for ways to save money on technical support.&quot;andM;Third-party support can cost anywhere from $50 to $200 an hour, says Bowers,depending on where a company is located.andP;  For a company with thousands ofPCs, the annual cost can be astronomical.andP;  One of Bowers's corporate clientswas spending about $1 million a year for its support contract.andP;  In most ofthe on-site calls, the repair person found a simple problem that could havebeen corrected by an informed user.andM;These are exactly the problems that a system-diagnostic program can helpsolve.andP;  &quot;Diagnostic software is the easiest way to save money,&quot; says Bowers.andO;&quot;These programs can cut most companies' support costs by nearly two thirds.&quot;andM;A byte-by-byte breakdown.andP;  System-diagnostic programs perform severalfunctions.andP;  They tell you exactly what's in a computer--the kind of CPU, thenumber of serial and parallel ports, whether it has a math coprocessor, howmuch and what type of memory is installed, what kind of ROM BIOS it uses, andso on.andP;  These programs also report on your memory-resident programs, tellingyou what interrupts they use.andP;  This can help identify and eliminatememory-address conflicts.andP;  And some of them run operational tests and speedbenchmarks.andM;System-diagnostic programs differ from utilities such as The Norton Utilitiesmainly in their emphasis on the hardware system and in the breadth of theirdiagnostic analysis.andP;  Each system-diagnostic program has its specialty.andO;Manifest ($59.95, from Quarterdeck Office Systems, Santa Monica, Calif.)andO;focuses on memory.andP;  It tells you how much and what kinds of memory you haveavailable and which portions of RAM are faster.andP;  Then it shows you how toload network software, buffers, drivers, and memory-resident programs intounused memory.andP;  It will even test the speed of your memory boards.andM;Two programs do even more testing.andP;  QAPlus Advanced Diagnostics ($134.95,from DiagSoft, Scotts Valley, Calif.) and Check It ($149, from TouchStoneSoftware Corp., Seal Beach, Calif.) send data to the ports, printer, andmonitor to make sure that they function properly.andP;  These programs also testindividual memory chips and show the location of bad ones in a screendiagram.andP;  System Sleuth ($149, from Dariana Technology Group, Buena Park,Calif.) gives you detailed information on your disk drives, as well.andM;Jack Aderhold, a computer-support technician, uses Check It several times aweek.andP;  Alderhold is responsible for maintaining 100 PCs at Honeywell TestInstruments Division (Denver, Colo).andP;  &quot;Using Check It saves me 15 to 20minutes each time I work on a machine,&quot; he says.andM;In one case, Aderhold had to test a computer for faulty memory chips.andP;  In thepast, that would have meant a laborious, time-consuming process of removing,replacing, and testing each chip in succession.andP;  But in just a couple ofminutes, Check It showed him exactly which chips were bad.andP;  &quot;It saved mehours,&quot; he says.andM;Problem-solving on the run.andP;  Support people can also run a diagnostic programremotely, giving them access to the data they need without making an on-sitecall.andP;  That makes life a lot simpler for Stephen Cooke, president of ConSpecData Systems, a value-added system reseller in Jaffrey, N.H.andP;  Cooke's clientsare spread out all over New England.andP;  &quot;I'm kind of like a country doctor,&quot;says Cooke, &quot;I'm always on call and I cover a lot of terrain.&quot;andM;Before Cooke started bundling System Sleuth with the systems he sells, heoften had to drive a couple of hundred miles to spend 15 minutes fixing aproblem that he could easily have talked his client through over thetelephone.andP;  With System Sleuth, he can check out his clients' problems viamodem.andP;  &quot;I can even solve problems from my car phone,&quot; he says.andM;Software vendors, as well as hardware vendors, are looking for ways to reducethe mounting burden of technical support services.andP;  That's how QuarterdeckOffice Systems first dreamed up Manifest.andP;  The company initially intendedjust to bundle Manifest with its memory products so that its supporttechnicians could find out exactly what was in a caller's computer.andP;  ButQuarterdeck's corporate customers were so enthusiastic about the program thatthe company decided to sell it as a stand-alone package.andM;Fix it yourself.andP;  For both corporations and individuals, the benefits ofdiagnostic software are severalfold.andP;  Savvy users who understand theinformation reported by a diagnostic program may be able to fix problems ontheir own and thereby eliminate some support calls entirely.andM;When Bruce Senator, an advertising and marketing consultant in Orange,Calif., had trouble getting his 80386 PC to work after installing anextended-memory board, he loaded up Check It.andP;  &quot;Neither the dealer nor themanufacturer could figure out what was wrong,&quot; he says.andP;  But a quickdiagnostic session with Check It led Senator to discover that the memorychips on the motherboard were incompatible with the memory chips on the newboard.andP;  The solution: Replace the chips on the motherboard.andM;If you can't fix a problem yourself, it still helps to have the diagnosticreports handy for the support technician.andP;  &quot;If you can give the repair persona headstart, you cut down on the repair time and cost,&quot; says C. ShannonJenkins, president of TouchStone Software.andP;  This also means you can get backto productive work more quickly.andP;  &quot;When a user can't do his or her job,that's also a cost,&quot; says David Cearly, a senior analyst with the GartnerGroup, a market research firm in Stamford, Conn.andM;Cearly believes system-diagnostic programs will become important tools formany companies with a big investment in PCs.andP;  &quot;We've automated the user,&quot; hesays.andP;  &quot;Now it's time to automate the support function.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
