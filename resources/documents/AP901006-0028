Security Council Gives OK for Haiti Election Monitors</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Security Council has approved U.N.monitors for Haiti's elections, and France pledged $2 million tohelp organize the voting.   The Security Council's action came Friday in a letter to U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, approving his plan tohelp the Caribbean nation with its Dec. 16 elections.   The U.N. General Assembly is expected to give final approvalMonday.   Haiti is struggling to introduce democratic government. Theimpoverished country, which declared independence from France in1804, has been ruled by military force during most of its history.   The last attempt at free elections collapsed in 1987 when thugsbacked by the army shot and hacked to death at least 34 voters.   In recent months, former members of the security service ofousted dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier have returned to Haiti. ManyHaitians worry they will interfere in the elections.   Perez de Cuellar has indicated he will send 87 staff members, 80election monitors and 150 military personnel at a cost of about $10million.   Haitian President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot opposes the presence ofarmed personnel, however.   Diplomats say most Haitians consider armed security men asoppressors after three decades of dictatorship by the Duvalierfamily.   On Thursday, Haiti's Electoral Council signed an agreement withthe Organization of American States for about 25 OAS poll watchersto monitor the campaign and election.   Another team of election observers will be led by formerPresident Jimmy Carter.   The request for U.N. observers touched off a battle in theSecurity Council between the United States and a coalition of Cuba,China and Colombia.   The United States backed the plan. The other three nationscontended that there was no threat to international peace posed bythe Haitian situation and that the council therefore had nojurisdiction.   In announcing its electoral aid, the French Embassy in Haitisaid Friday that France was contributing the $2 million to supporta civic education campaign and the printing of ballots.   The United States has pledged $6.4 million in electoralassistance.</TEXT></DOC>
