Alterman, a Public Health Service ADP official said at a technologybriefing in Washington.andM;Getting new information quickly is key in fighting the AIDS epidemic,Alterman said.andP;  &quot;If we can cut three months off the communication time on atherapy, we have made a real impact on about 5,000 people, and about 2,000 ofthem will live that might not have lived,&quot; he said.andM;Progress on the AIDS front requires rapid exchange of information betweenNational Institutes of Health researchers in Bethesda, Md., Food and DrugAdministration personnel coordinating clinical trials, epidemiologists at theCenters for Disease Control in Atlanta and staff at the National Library ofMedicine.andM;&quot;Internal paperwork is the connectivity tissue disease of the government,&quot;Alterman said.andP;  &quot;Anything we can do to facilitate communications between thisstaff guy in Atlanta and that staff guy in Bethesda is going to have,frankly, a direct effect on whether someone lives of doesn't live.andP;  Andthat's about as important a function as electronic mail can carry,&quot; he said.andM;The SoftSwitch messaging product from SoftSwitch Inc. of Wayne, Pa., whichhas become a strategic communications utility for the Public Health Service,today runs only under mainframe MVS or VM.andM;Unix VersionandM;SoftSwitch announced last month it will develop a Unix version of itselectronic message-switching software to run on Data General Corp.'s Aviionreduced-instruction-set computing hardware.andM;Users can configure the Unix version of SoftSwitch Central to act as eitheran X.400 message transfer agent, a Systems Network Architecture DistributedServices (SNADS) gateway or a multiprotocol switch.andM;SoftSwitch Central software running on an MVS mainframe at the  Public HealthService's Parklawn Computer Center in Rockville, Md., acts as a SNADS gatewayto nine electronic-messaging systems, including Banyan Mail from BanyanSystems Inc. of Westborough, Mass., and cc:Mail from cc:Mail Inc. of PaloAlto, Calif.andM;&quot;Directory synchronization is a problem we are grappling with,&quot; Altermansaid.andM;A company official at the technology briefing said SoftSwitch directorysupport for synchronizing Banyan and cc:Mail networks will be available inJune.andP;  SoftSwitch today has directory synchronization products for WangLaboratories Inc.'s Wang Office, Digital Equipment Corp.'s DEC All-In-1 andIBM Corp.'s Profs.andM;Dave Foster, SoftSwitch marketing vice president, said mail-enabledapplications are a reasonable way to build bridges between organizations,better-suited than either batch communications or full interactiveapplications, he said.andM;&quot;Simple distribution lists can significantly enhance organizationaleffectiveness,&quot; Foster said.andM;Mail-enabled applications run the gamut from person-to-person messages,person-to-application messaging and application-to-application messaging.andM;Electronic messaging to collect information for budgetting and reporting, toroute documents and to access libraries of policies and procedures isbecoming a fairly accepted way to reduce paper flow in organizations, hesaid.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
