For its quarter ended Feb. 2, Home Depot reported earningsof $67.6 million, or 31 cents a share, compared with $41.5million, or 23 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.Sales rose 29%, to $1.29 billion from $1 billion; on astore-by-store basis, sales were up 12%, the company said.</LP><TEXT>   Several analysts promptly increased their estimates forthe Atlanta-based retailer's profits in the coming year andsaid Home Depot's performance may show that the company isstarting to benefit from a slow economic recovery. They notedthat some of Home Depot's smaller rivals, including Lowe'sCos. and Hechinger Co., have had strong sales gains recently.   Home Depot officials said they didn't attribute theimpressive fourth-quarter results to an improved economy. Thecompany performed well during the recession, as it won overcustomers from locally owned lumber and hardware stores andbenefited from an increased do-it-yourself mentality.   But Dan R. Wewer, an analyst with Robinson Humphrey Co.,said Home Depot is now benefiting from a rebound in lumbersales and a decline in customers' tendency to chooseless-expensive models of home-improvement equipment.   Home Depot's gross profit margins also improved, to 29.6%of sales from 29%, partly because the company's growth gaveit better volume rebates from suppliers. Also, the companysaid relatively lower advertising and occupancy costs helpedthe bottom line.   For the full fiscal year, earnings rose 52% to $249.2million, or $1.20 a share, from $163.4 million, or 90 cents ashare, the previous year. Revenue was up 35% to $5.14 billionfrom $3.82 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
