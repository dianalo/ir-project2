Explosive for a masterdie uses smaller critical tablet diameter and a titamite with 9 mm diameterand 4300 m/s of blasting speed. For automatic loading spare-dies, titamitein a plastic tube with size and weight 25 mm x 100 g is used. A guidepipe for master die insert is a polycarbonate pipe with O.D. 13 x 1500mm length, whose tip end is fitted with a wooden tip cone, which easilyinserts at the loading density 1.0 g/cm{sup 2}, also eliminating theproblem of friction static electricity (below 500 V). Loading time wassimilar to the manual loading, if the time for machine handling, hoseremoving and matrix die loading is totally calculated. The real meritsare the higher loading density and the remote handling apart from thefaces in the mines. (1 fig, 1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
