Gas output is well below thedesign level at both plants. Describes an in-situ coal gasification methoddeveloped recently at the Dnepropetrovsk Mining Institute. The methodconsists in drilling two directional boreholes that are initially inclinedand then horizontal along the coal deposit. Gasification occurs in thespace between the air downcast hole and the gas output hole. The through-channelsbetween the two boreholes can be executed by drilling, burning, penetrationwith compressed air or using hydraulic or chemical methods. Ignitionis by chemical incendiary substances. The reaction zone moves towardsthe incoming air stream. Gasification effectiveness can be improved byoperation at elevated pressures (2-4 MPa) and temperatures (1,300-1,600C) and using oxygen enrichment.</TEXT></DOC>
