The pesticides are based on Bacillus thuringiensisbacteria that make toxins fatal to insect pests, such ascaterpillars, but harmless to animals and humans. Sales of Btsprays have taken off in recent years as harmful insects havebecome resistant to synthetic chemical pesticides and asfarmers have been pressured to cut their use of thechemicals.   But now there's a Bt problem: Farmers in Hawaii, Florida,New York and the Far East have reported that a major pest,the diamondback moth, has become resistant to it. The moths,found on cabbages and watercress, aren't hurting growers muchyet. But increasing Bt resistance may blunt a major newweapon against pests -- plants genetically engineered toproduce Bt's toxins. Within a few years, Monsanto and othershope to introduce cotton, potato and tomato plants able tomake their own Bt toxins.   Bt resistance won't necessarily spread to other pests andplaces, says Randy Deaton, a Monsanto research manager.Besides, he adds, plants could be engineered to producemultiple Bt toxins, making it unlikely pests would evolvewith the right combination of genes to resist all the toxins.   But over the years, some insects have evolved &quot;multiple&quot;resistance to different chemical pesticides, notes CornellUniversity entomologist Rick Roush. Thus, he says, &quot;managinginsect resistance is a matter of delaying.&quot;                                                                                                          Rate of Increase Slows   For One Greenhouse Gas                                                                                                          THE ATMOSPHERE'S level of methane is rising less rapidlythan it did a decade ago.   Carbon dioxide, released when things are burned, is themain greenhouse gas, trapping heat from the sun and possiblycausing global warming. But methane traps heat about 20 timesmore effectively than carbon dioxide does. Released by ricepaddies, wetlands, landfills and the digestive processes ofcattle, methane is estimated to contribute about 20% of thegreenhouse effect.   In the early 1980s, atmospheric methane rose more than 1%a year, says Aslam Khalil, a climate researcher at the OregonGraduate Institute of Science and Technology. Now the rate ofincrease has fallen to about 0.8%, perhaps because the growthof rice and cattle farming has leveled off.   But that's not necessarily good news. Methane helpscounteract the thinning of the ozone layer caused by therelease of chlorofluorocarbons, and the ozone layer blockscancer-causing solar rays. Thus, climate experts proposingmajor cuts in methane levels to counteract global warming maybe making a big mistake, Dr. Khalil argues.   Still, &quot;it's tempting to work on methane&quot; to help ward offwarming, says Ralph Cicerone, a researcher at the Universityof California at Irvine. That's mainly because cutting itsemissions would yield much greater gains against thegreenhouse effect than cutting the same amount of carbondioxide emissions, he adds.                                                                                                          Refillable Bottles   Are Slow to Come Back                                                                                                          REFILLABLE beverage containers cut trash and save energyand money.   Indeed, refilling bottles is generally cheaper and betterfor the environment than breaking them down and recyclingthem. But don't count on a big comeback soon for refillables.The logistics work best for small, local bottlers withlimited distribution areas, and now the bottling industry isdominated by larger, regional companies, says Scott Chaplin,a researcher at the Rocky Mountain Institute, a think tank inSnowmass, Colo.   In 1990, about 8.7% of U.S. soft drinks came inrefillables, down from 56% in 1975. Despite growing use ofrefillable beer bottles in some states, refillables' overallshare of the U.S. packaged beer market fell last year to anestimated 7.5% from 7.8% in 1989, says Robert S. Weinberg, abeer-industry expert at Washington University in St. Louis.   But refillables are becoming more common for some things,most notably milk. Sales of caps for refillable milkcontainers have risen about 15% annually during the pastthree years, says Murray Bain, marketing manager at Stanpac,a Smithville, Ontario, maker of the caps. Beachhurst Farms,which delivers milk to homes in the New York City area, saysit now carries refillables on 33 routes, up from 13 lastyear. Schroeder's Milk, St. Paul, Minn., says sales inrefillables have risen fivefold in the past three years.   The dairy industry &quot;still has remnants of littleprocessors that haven't changed much from the 1950s,&quot; saysSteven Rasmussen, president of Castle Creamery in Hayward,Calif. Thus, it has had little trouble expanding the use ofrefillables for nostalgic and environmentally awareconsumers.                                                                                                          For Environmentalists,   A 606-Page Almanac                                                                                                          HOUGHTON MIFFLIN has published a $10 almanac claiming tohave &quot;everything you need to know about the environment.&quot;   That's debatable, of course. But the 606-page&quot;Environmental Almanac,&quot; compiled for Houghton Mifflin by theWorld Resources Institute, a Washington think tank, may offermore environmental data than any other single book.   Some excerpts: Federal regulators found pesticide residuesin 82% of celery shipments in 1987. Anyone who cuts down atree in Vienna must replace it. Jefferson County, La., hashigher emissions of cancer-causing chemicals than any otherU.S. county. In a ranking of 64 U.S. cities by environmentalquality and awareness, the almanac lists Honolulu No. 1 andSanta Ana, Calif., No. 64.</TEXT></DOC>
