Verenigde BedrijvenNutricia has a simple product strategy: It makes food forpeople who don't have any choice about what they eat.   Nutricia is one of the top European makers of infantformula and baby cereals, competing with the likes of NestleS.A. of Switzerland and Milupa AG of West Germany in a marketwhere doctors and parents call the shots. Once an infantoutgrows such fare, Nutricia bows out, leaving themass-market food companies to scrap over fickle appetites.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The moment you don't feel well,&quot; says Erlend van derHagen, Nutricia's management-board chairman, &quot;we jump inagain.&quot; The company's other core business is making specialfoods and nutritional supplements for the ill, sold mostly tohospitals.   Somewhat less simple are Nutricia's choices about where toexpand outside its base in Western Europe -- a vital questionas the company seeks to retain its independence in a rapidlyconsolidating food industry.   Many Dutch companies have long viewed the U.S. as theirtop priority for overseas growth. But Nutricia, which got alate start breaking out of its home market, says it wants toavoid an expensive fight for a large slice of the U.S.market. Instead, Mr. van der Hagen said in an interview, thecompany will put a higher priority on Europe (notably thesouthern and eastern parts where its sales are still small)and on the Far East.   For decades after it was formed in 1901 by a doctor and adairy-plant operator, Nutricia was content with the Dutchmarket. After World War II, the company spilled over theborder into Belgium. Then, in the 1970s, Nutricia made astrategic choice that Mr. van der Hagen says was &quot;totallywrong.&quot; Rather than trying to become a global player in theproducts it knew best, the company confined itself to theBenelux market and diversified its product range intomargarine, sauces, pickles, processed fruits and snacks.   By 1979, that strategy had driven Nutricia into the red.The company's product range was too unfocused, and itsmarkets too small.   Mr. van der Hagen, a grandson of one of the founders,reacted by moving from Nutricia's supervisory board to themanagement board in 1979. He quickly began selling thediversified food units. &quot;I simply put the company back to itsorigins,&quot; he says.   Mr. van der Hagen decided that Nutricia's future was inproducts for which medical endorsements are vital rather thanthose that require mass marketing. (The company kept a fewmass-market products, such as Chocomel chocolate milk andNutroma coffee creamer, which provide an outlet for milk fatseparated out in making infant formula. But those productsare sold only in the Benelux countries.)   Mr. van der Hagen's approach has worked so far: Nutricia'snet income has doubled in the past five years, reaching 60.3million guilders ($32 million) last year on sales of 905.3million guilders, and the company's return on equity is wellabove average at about 20%. The company also has raised theshare of its revenue derived outside the Netherlands to about64% from 20% a decade ago.   Mr. van der Hagen says Nutricia began to organizeproduction on a pan-European scale long before the 1992unified market plan took off. Asked about 1992, he says, &quot;Weinvented it in 1980.&quot;   Even so, Nutricia had little presence in West Germanyuntil April, when it acquired Immergut Milch G.m.b.H., adairy-products company. Mr. van der Hagen promises totransform Immergut into a German version of Nutricia.   Milupa, Germany's leading infant-formula and baby-cerealmaker, says it isn't worried. Told about Nutricia'sambitions, Milupa director Joerg Zehelein says, &quot;Well, goodluck.&quot; Mr. Zehelein notes that other foreign health-care andnutrition companies have found the German market extremelyhard to penetrate.   One challenge for Nutricia is that German doctors tend tofavor feeding hospital patients intravenously. Nutricia'sproducts are &quot;enteral&quot; -- that is, absorbed through thedigestive system rather than the blood stream. But Mr. vander Hagen says the German market is rapidly changing asdoctors recognize the advantages of enteral feeding, which isfar cheaper.   Meanwhile, Nutricia predicts that it can increase itsmarket share in southern Europe and says it is graduallybuilding up ties with the medical profession in EasternEurope. Last year, after an eight-year effort, Nutriciafinally cracked the Soviet market with a big sale of infantformula.   The graying of the population is expanding the market formedical nutrition throughout Europe; Campbell ManagementConsultants of Brussels estimates that European sales ofenteral foods are growing 15% to 20% a year. But competitionis growing, too. Last year, Nestle and Baxter InternationalInc. of the U.S. set up a joint venture in medical nutrition,Clintec International Inc., which already has set up units inBritain and Italy.   While defending its home market, Nutricia also is tryingto expand in Asia, where it has sales units in Hong Kong andTaiwan and a 50% share of a new infant-formula plant inIndonesia. Though Asia accounted for just 3.6% of sales lastyear, Mr. van der Hagen says Nutricia aims to become one ofthe leading suppliers there.   The U.S. market already is mature and offers less room forgrowth. In any case, analysts suspect that Nutricia doesn'twant to draw retaliatory attacks in its home market from suchcompanies as Abbott Laboratories Inc. and Bristol-MyersSquibb Co., which dominate the U.S. infant-formula market.&quot;We have no ambition to get into a fierce fight with Abbott,&quot;Mr. van der Hagen says.   Milupa apparently agrees. The German company closed asmall infant-formula factory in the U.S. last year afterdeciding it had better growth prospects in Europe.   Still, Mr. van der Hagen says Nutricia needs to be presentin the U.S. market to keep up with developments. Toward thatend, Nutricia acquired Loma Linda Foods Inc., a Riverside,Calif., maker of soybased infant formula, from a Seventh-dayAdventist Church organization in 1988. Loma Linda has about2% of the U.S. infant-formula market, and Mr. van der Hagensays Nutricia hopes to boost that share gradually.   Though Mr. van der Hagen talks cautiously, Dutchinvestment analysts tend to be bullish on Nutricia. On theAmsterdam Stock Exchange, the company's nonvotingcertificates, representing shares held by a trust, aretrading at about 14 times projected 1990 earnings, comparedwith a market average of 9.7. Even with that high rating,says Frans van Schaik of Barclays de Zoete Wedd NederlandN.V., Nutricia is still an attractive investment. He predictsnet income will surge at least 20% this year and another 10%in 1991.   Nutricia's certificates occasionally get a boost fromtakeover speculation. Mr. van der Hagen says that many majorfood companies have approached him about making a friendlybid for Nutricia but that none has been able to tell him whatwould be in it for Nutricia. (Unigate PLC of Britain ownsabout 25% of the shares but can't raise its stake withoutpermission of Nutricia's board.)   Though Nutricia says it is in good shape to survive as anindependent company, it isn't taking any chances. The companyhas armed itself with all the protective barriers allowed toDutch companies, making a hostile takeover virtuallyimpossible.   Earlier this year, the Amsterdam exchange pressed Nutriciaand other companies to give up some of their protectivebarriers in an effort to bring Dutch stock market practicescloser to international norms. As a gentle form of pressure,the exchange began using a special symbol in its officialgazette to flag companies that refuse to modify theirprotective devices.   Nutricia was unimpressed. &quot;We have a black dot,&quot; Mr. vander Hagen says gleefully, &quot;and we're very proud of it.&quot;   Eventually, the European Community is expected to forceDutch companies to reduce their takeover protections. If thathappens, Mr. van der Hagen says, the company will simply findsomewhere else to list its nonvoting certificates.</TEXT></DOC>
