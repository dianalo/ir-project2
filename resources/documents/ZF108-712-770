Mac II computers.andP;  It will replace aportion of an existing classified network that carries black-and-white video,text and graphics.andM;&quot;The immediate use of the prototype network will be to allow scientists totake less complex portions of large computational codes and run them onworkstations in their own offices.andP;  The problems can then be returned to thesupercomputers if necessary,&quot; Rupert said.andM;High-resolution visualization is another reason why the lab is interested inthe network.andP;  It will give scientists and engineers the capability of viewinga virtual movie of their computer models and allow them to simulate complexphenomena such as nuclear explosions and aircraft flight dynamics.andP;  Officialssaid the network permits displays with 16 million colors and a resolutionfour times better than standard television sets.andM;Lab and company officials said the CXT/1000 is analogous to a telephoneswitch because it supplies point-to-point connections using circuit switchingtechnology over fiber-optic lines.andP;  The CXT (Circuit Exchange Terminal)module, which is the heart of a CXT/1000 system, consists of a circuitswitch, communications controller and full-duplex, fiber-optic, input/outputconnections for 16 nodes.andP;  Four modules mount inside a 7-inch-high enclosureto supply up to 64 non-blocking channels with any line having the capabilityto connect to any other line.andM;Multiple enclosures can connect via fiber-optical cabling to form a networkof virtually unlimited bandwidth for linking disparate computers and localarea networks.andM;&quot;The switch is built from a single type of printed circuit board.andP;  You cankeep plugging these together to build as bing a system as you want,&quot; Andersonsaid.andM;Equipment connects to a CXT through Ancor-supplied interface modules, whicheither go inside a computer like a network interface card or connect to anexternal data port.andP;  These modules supply the high-speed information transferand bridging, protocol conversion and control functions.andM;Rupert said if the network proves successful it will be extended to includeall of the nearly 1,700 scientists and engineers involved in classified workat the lab.andP;  Such a network would cost between $20 million and $40 millionand have an aggregate capacity of 850 gigabaud, the official said.andM;&quot;While current communication networks have a limited capacity or pie todivide, this technology will enlarge the pie each time more scientists andengineers join the network.andP;  If it proves successful, we should be able toleapfrog the next generation of communication networks,&quot; Rupert said.andM;The prototype network, which will cost the lab's weapons program $850,000,will arrive in December and become operational next April if it goesaccording to plan.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
