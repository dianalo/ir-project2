Gas temperature profiles and the mean temperature are calculatedwith allowance for discharge inhomogeneity for three different modelsof input power distribution over the cross-section of the gas-dischargetube. It is found that discharge inhomogeneity significantly affectsthe mean gas temperature. 19 references.</TEXT></DOC>
