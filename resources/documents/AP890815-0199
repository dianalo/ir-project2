Poor blacks and Hispanics are under-represented in AIDS clinicaltrials where experimental therapies are tested, and they often don'tseek treatment until they are sick enough to qualify for freemedical care, said AIDS caseworkers attending a governmentconference on AIDS and minorities.   ``They're not as well-educated about prevention and they don'thave a cousin who is a doctor who can tell them about the latestdrug that's being tested in a clinical trial in their area,'' saidDr. Gina Brown, an assistant attending physician in obstetrics andgynecology at Harlem Hospital.   Also, the poor are often suspicious of attempts to get them intomedical research, she said. Many hear only that the treatments, likeAZT, make patients sick and don't understand that the drug cancripple the AIDS virus, said Brown, also a clinical instructor atColumbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Teen-agers and adults alike view drug abuse asthe most important problem facing the country _ eclipsing fear ofwar, the economy, AIDS, crime, abortion and alcohol abuse as topconcerns, says a new Gallup poll.
