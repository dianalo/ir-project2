(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A rescue convoy stood byat the shuttle's Mojave Desert landing site in case of an emergencytoday, but once Discovery reached orbit the ground crew settleddown to prepare for the scheduled touchdown in four days.   The shuttle is to complete its mission with a landing hereMonday morning on the hard, clay-like surface of Rogers DryLakebed, but ``We're ready to support a landing anytime during themission,'' NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato said Wednesday.   The lakebed is the prime site for an earlier emergency landing,including what the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationcalls an abort-once-around, a landing after one low orbit spurredby a premature shutdown of the main shuttle engines followinglaunch.   ``The only reason they wouldn't come here (for anabort-once-around) would be weather _ if there were flooding (ofthe lakebed) or severe winds,'' said NASA spokesman FranklinO'Donnell.   But the Air Force forecast sunny skies, temperatures climbing tonear 90 degrees and winds up to 17 mph for today _ acceptableconditions for an emergency landing here.   Bad weather here during an abort-once-around would force theshuttle to land at White Sands, N.M., or back at the Kennedy SpaceCenter launch site in Florida.   Loss of two main engines soon after launch would dictate atrans-Atlantic abort landing at Ben Guerir, Morocco; Moron, Spain;or Banjul, Gambia. A shutdown of the engines even earlier mightrequire a return-to-launch-site landing in Florida.   A 110-person recovery convoy of NASA and Air Force rescuers wasready to wait out the launch in NASA's shuttle operations areahere, then drive numerous rescue and service vehicles onto thelakebed if an emergency landing was needed, Lovato said.   After any landing, technicians check for hazardous vapors aroundthe shuttle orbiter, then connect various cooling and gas-purginglines to the spacecraft. Plans call for the shuttle crew to emergefrom the orbiter 30 to 40 minutes after landing.</TEXT></DOC>
