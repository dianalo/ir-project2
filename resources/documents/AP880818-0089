The typewritten statement from Islamic Jihad was delivered tothe Beirut office of the Reuters news agency along with ablack-and-white photograph of American hostage Terry Anderson.   Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, has admitted holding Anderson andThomas Sutherland. A total of 18 foreigners, including nineAmericans, are missing and believed kidnapped in Lebanon.   Anderson, 40, of Lorain, Ohio, is the chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He is the longest-heldforeign captive, kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut on March 16, 1985.   Anderson's photograph was released with the Arabic-languagestatement in the group's normal way of proving the statement isauthentic.   The photograph, the 10th of Anderson released by Islamic Jihad,showed the captive from the chest up with a bushy beard and anuntrimmed moustache. He was wearing a sweatshirt and lookingstraight into the camera without his glasses.   On Wednesday night, a telephone call to Reuters, purportedlyfrom Islamic Jihad, said British hostage Terry Waite, an Anglicanchurch envoy, may be freed on a Shiite anniversary Monday if theBritish government shows ``good intentions.''   The developments came during speculation that Iran might use itsinfluence on its supporters in Lebanon to release the hostages. Acease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war is scheduled to start Saturday, andIran has been making conciliatory statements toward the West sinceaccepting the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire on July 18.   But the Islamic Jihad statement released today said: ``None ofthe captives will be released until our demands are met in full.''   The statement outlined the demands as:   ``The release of all our mujahedeen (holy fighters) from allArab and foreign prisons (including 17 Shiites convicted in the1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait and nowheld in Kuwaiti prisons).   ``The release of all Lebanese and Palestinian mujahedeen fromthe prisons of Israel and its surrogates in the (southern Lebanese)security zone and (Christian) east Beirut.   ``The unconditional withdrawal of all the Israeli forces andtheir allies from south Lebanon.   ``The reconstruction of south Lebanon and Beirut which have beendevastated by the American-Israeli plot and compensation for ouroppressed people in Lebanon for all the losses it suffered.''   The statement said any expected rapid release of the hostages is``a mirage assumed to be water by a thirsty man.''   ``We are the only side that decides the fate of the captives, beit at the level of releasing them, executing them or maintainingtheir detention.''   The Wednesday night caller said in Arabic, ``British hostageTerry Waite is alive and we might release him if the government of(British Prime Minister Margaret) Thatcher showed good intentions.''   Waite, 48, disappeared Jan. 28, 1987 after leaving a west Beiruthotel to negotiate the release of hostages with representatives ofIslamic Jihad.   There was no way to authenticate the telephoned statement, whichwould be the first admission by Islamic Jihad that it holds Waite.No group has formally claimed responsibility for his abduction.   In addition to Anderson, the group has admitted holdingSutherland, 57, of Fort Collins, Colo. Sutherland, acting dean ofagriculture at the American University of Beirut, was abducted June9, 1985.   Islamic Jihad repeatedly has warned not to trust theauthenticity of telephone statements attributed to it.   But a man claiming to speak for Islamic Jihad announced therelease of three French hostages in a May 4 telephone call to theeast Beirut headquarters of the Christian radio station, Voice ofLebanon. The three were released in Moslem west Beirut less than anhour later.   The telephone caller said Wednesday that Waite would be released``on the occasion of Ashoura,'' a Shiite anniversary of the 7thcentury killing of Imam Hussein, the prophet Mohammed's grandsonand one of the sect's most revered saints. The occasion falls onMonday.   Britain's ambassador to Lebanon, Alan Ramsey said he had noinformation related to the phone statement.   The British government this month sent a high-level diplomat toTehran for talks. Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, thespiritual leader of the Anglican church, met in London with a topIranian diplomat in an effort to gain the release of Waite and twoother British hostages in Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
