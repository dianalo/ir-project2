Hatch Nuclear Plant, Unit 2; Exemption</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I</ITAG>Georgia Power Company, et al. (the licensee) is the holder of FacilityOperating License No. NPF-5, which authorizes full power operation of theEdwin I. Hatch Nuclear Plant, Unit 2. The license provides, among otherthings, that it is subject to all rules, regulations and Orders of theNuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect.The facility incorporates a boiling water reactor at the licensee's sitelocated in Appling County, Georgia.<ITAG tagnum="84">II</ITAG>By letter dated January 6, 1988, the licensee requested an exemption fromthe requirements of 10 CFR 50.62(c)(4), which establishes the minimum injectionflow rate and the boron concentration for the standby liquid control system(SLCS).Specifically, 10 CFR 50.62(c)(4) requires that each boiling water reactormust have a SLCS with minimum flow capacity and boron content equivalentin control capacity to 86 gallons per minute (GPM) of 13 weight percent(w/o) sodium pentaborate solution. The licensee requested an exemptionfrom this requirement to permit use of a minimum flow rate of 41.2 GPMand an available sodium pentaborate concentration ranging from 6.2% to13 w/o depending on the volume in the existing SLCS storage tank. The Boron-10content of the boron in the dissolved sodium pentaborate solution wouldbe enriched to 60 atomic percent.The requirement established by the regulation was intended to provide forprompt injection of negative reactivity into a boiling water reactor pressurevessel in the event of an anticipated transient without scram (ATWS) event.The reactor vessel size used to establish the required flow rate of 86GPM and the sodium pentaborate concentration of 13 w/o was the large 251-inchdiameter vessel used in the BWR/5 and BWR/6 designs. The Hatch Unit 2 reactorhas a much smaller 218-inch diameter vessel. For the Hatch Unit 2 reactor,a lesser flow rate, following the formula proposed by the licensee, willprovide a negative reactivity injection in an ATWS event equivalent tothat called for by the regulation for the larger 251-inch diameter boilingwater reactor vessel. See Generic Letter 85-03, ``Clarification of EquivalentControl Capacity for Standby Liquid Control Systems,'' January 28, 1985.<ITAG tagnum="84">III</ITAG>In the case, the flow rate-boron 10 concentration relationship establishedby the licensee's formula will provide control capacity for the smallerHatch Unit 2 reactor pressure vessel equivalent to that called for by therule based on larger reactor pressure vessels. Requiring Hatch Unit 2 tohave the flow rate-boron 10 concentration capacity specified by the ruleis not necessary to provide adequate negative reactivity in the event ofan ATWs at Hatch Unit 2. Thus, the Commission's staff finds that thereare special circumstances in this case which satisfy the standards of 10CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii). As set forth in the Safety Evaluation of AmendmentNo. 90, issued concurrently with this Exemption, the staff has determinedthat operation under the revised Technical Specifications governing flowrate and boron-10 concentration will not endanger public health and safetyand will not be inimical to the common defense and security.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV</ITAG>Accordingly, the Commission has determined that pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12,an exemption is authorized by law and will not present an undue risk tothe public health and safety, and is consistent with the common defenseand security, and hereby grants the following exemption with respect tothe requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of 10 CFR 50.62.The licensee may operate the facility with flow rate and boron concentrationrequirements as set forth in sections 3.1.5. and 4.1.5 of the Hatch Unit2 facility Technical Specification.Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting thisExemption will have no significant impact on the environment (53 FR 2659).<ITAG tagnum="21">This Exemption is effective upon issuance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 3rd day of February 1988:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For The Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Steven A.
