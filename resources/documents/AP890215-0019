The CRP was included in the 1985 farm law as a vehicle for taking40 million to 45 million acres of highly erodible land from cropproduction and planting it in protective grass and trees for 10years.   More than 28 million acres have been enrolled, and USDA officialssay further signups will bring the 1990 target within reach.   Overall, the report said Tuesday, the CRP ``may generate anestimated $3.5 billion to $4 billion in water quality benefits''through reduced water treatment costs, lower sediment removal costs,less damage to equipment that uses water, and increased recreationalfishing.   Farming activities generate materials than can be carried intowaterways by runoff. These farm-generated pollutants includenutrients from chemical fertilizers and animal manure, primarilynitrogen and phosphorous; pesticides; sediment; and dissolvedminerals and salts, the report said.   ``Sediment washing off cropland and into waterways can fillreservoirs, block navigation channels, interfere with conveyancesystems, harm aquatic plant life and degrade recreationalresources,'' the report said.   ``Potential for the CRP to bring about a major reduction in thedischarge of agricultural pollutants into waterways is large,because of the large acreage involved and because only highlyerodible land is eligible to be enrolled,'' the report said.   The study, by the department's Economic Research Service, saidthe estimate of $3.5 billion to $4 billion in water benefits wasbased on an assumption that the full 45 million acres would besigned into the program.   It said the benefit estimates are incomplete because neither thebenefits associated with swimming and commercial fishing nor thosefrom reduced pesticide use were taken into account.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Farmers are going to use more fertilizer thisyear, and they'll be paying higher prices for it, says theAgriculture Department.   Overall, fertilizer use by U.S. farmers is expected to rise 9percent this year because of larger crop plantings and higher cropprices, the department's Economic Research Service said Tuesday in areport. By spring planting, prices are expected to average about 7percent more than a year ago.   World use of commercial fertilizers also is climbing, a trendthat is expected to continue at least for several more years.   ``By the early 1990s, world growth in nitrogen demand couldexceed supply, leading to higher prices,'' the report said. ``Thedeveloped countries will likely have excess phosphate supplies,while the Soviet Union, Asia and Eastern Europe will be deficitareas.''   The greatest surplus of potash, another fertilizer ingredient, isexpected to be in North America, while Western Europe, Asia, Afriaand Latin America are projected to be in short supply, the reportsaid.   Some other farm production items are likely to be more costlythis spring, including pesticides, up 2 percent to 5 percent; cropseeds, 10 percent to 15 percent; and farm energy costs.   ``Despite the drought, 1988 farm machinery expenditures rose anestimated 5 percent to 10 percent over 1987,'' the report said. ``Asimilar increase is likely in 1989, when expenditures could reach$6.4 billion to $7.1 billion.''   Last year's sales of most types of machinery remained stable orincreased, except for a 16 percent drop in combine sales, the reportsaid. Barring poor weather, sales of all major kinds of machineryare expected to increase in 1989.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Agriculture Department plans to lower honeysupports for the 1989 crop by nearly 5 percent from last year, partof a gradual decline specified by 1985 farm law.   Milton Hertz, executive vice president of the department'sCommodity Credit Corp., said Tuesday that the basic honey supportwould be lowered to 56.36 cents per pound from 59.1 cents in 1988.   Adjustments of the basic support can be made according to honey'sflower source, color, class, grade, location and other marketdifferentials.   Details of the 1989 honey program were officially published Feb.13 in the government's rule-making document, the Federal Register.   Comments on the proposal can be sent by March 15 to: Director,Commodity Analysis Division, USDA-ASCS, P.O. Box 2415, Washington,D.C. 20013.   Hertz also asked for comments on continuing the program's``marketing loan'' provision, which allows producers to repay honeyprice support loans at less than the original loan rate.   In effect, this lets the producer to ``sell'' honey to thegovernment and then buy it back for less.   Currently, for example, producers can buy back 1988-crop honey atrates of 34 to 40 cents per pound, depending on quality. The CCCloans originally were for 48 to 62 cents per pound.</TEXT></DOC>
