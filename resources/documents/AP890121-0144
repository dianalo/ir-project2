FRAZIER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Six white supremacists marched through downtownSaturday surrounded by National Guard troops in riot gear ashundreds of angry counterdemonstrators hurled bricks, rocks andinsults at them.   A half-dozen law enforcement officers were injured as violencebroke out along the route and in spots throughout downtown after themarch. Police reported 42 arrests.   Two thousand police officers and National Guardsmen surroundedthe Capitol and lined the mile-long march route, trying to keepabout 1,000 counterdemonstrators away from the white supremacists.   John Bankhead, a spokesman for the Georgia Bureau ofInvestigation, said the counterdemonstrators overwhelmed thesecurity forces at some points. The white supremacists said theycompleted their march battered from being hit with debris, butwithout serious injuries.   ``I wouldn't call it a riot,'' said Public Safety CommissionerGeorge Napper, who was quickly surrounded by an angry crowd of about50 people when he appeared downtown after the march. ``It's anunusual situation that we're going to contain.''   He told the crowd the white supremacists had a right to march,adding, ``They're entitled to protection. it's not always easy.''   The six marchers were among 10 white supremacists who had ralliedat the state Capitol, marking the second anniversary of clashesbetween civil rights marchers and white onlookers in neighboringForsyth County.   Rally organizer Richard Barrett, a Mississippi lawyer and leaderof the white supremacist Nationalist Movement, had predicted 1,000supporters would attend his rally and march, which also was aprotest of last week's observances honoring the Rev. Martin LutherKing Jr.   ``People ask me, `Where are your numbers?''' Barrett told thenine supporters at the Capitol. ``How many people were at Kitty Hawk(where the Wright brothers made their historic flight)? I don'tknow, but it changed the course of history. I have the spirit ofKitty Hawk in my heart.''   As Barrett's group walked from the Capitol to near The Omnisports arena, they were surrounded by riot-helmeted Guardsmen,massed shoulder to shoulder, who covered almost a full city block.   The Guardsmen were led by a convoy that included 12 motorcycleofficers, four police cars, two dozen officers on foot, two policebuses and two vans.   At the end of the route, the marchers were met by dozens ofyouths throwing bottles, bricks and other objects. The violencescattered dozens of curious bystanders, including conventioneers intown for a homebuilders trade show.   When the convoy turned around and marched back to the Capitol,the melee continued, with more rocks and bottles tossed at the group.   After the march, hundreds of people milled about at spotsthroughout downtown. Vandals at the Underground Atlanta shopping andentertainment complex, which is under construction, threw buildingmaterials.   Police used riot shields and clubs to disperse the crowds, andseveral people were seen struck by policemen wielding billy clubs.   By sundown, the streets downtown were quiet.   At a City Hall news conference, Napper said he thought policehandled the day's events well. He said Atlanta historically has beenable to work out its racial conflicts, adding, ``I think that's whywe haven't had the kind of situations that took place in Miami.''   During the melee, a police officer was knocked unconscious by aflying rock, a National Guardsman was injured by a brick that hithis foot, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said several of itsagents were hurt, and Grady Hospital said it was treating twoofficers from the state Department of Natural Resources.   Barrett's rally and march was billed as a resumption of onecanceled at the last minute in July by police on the eve of theDemocratic National Convention. That march was canceled as about 500counterdemonstrators gathered and police feared violence.   As troops waited for Barrett's rally to begin, a loudspeakerblared a song proclaiming, ``If the South would have won, we'd haveit made.''   A few blocks away, about 1,000 people gathered at Woodruff Parkto demonstrate against the supremacists. Participants, ranging fromclean-cut Emory University students to punk rockers to streetpeople, were separated from the streets that the white supremacistmarchers were to take by 100 police officers.   The counterdemonstration was organized by a New York-based groupcalled the Partisan Defense Committee, which bills itself as aTrotskyist-socialist organization.   Gene Herson, a member of the group, said it was not seeking aviolent confrontation but wanted to make a statement of its own. Hesaid the white supremacist march was ``a provocation in a city thatis predominantly black, has a large Jewish population and is strongin trade unions. These are all things the Klan is against.''   Barrett said his rally was intended to repudiate the holidaymarking King's birthday.   ``The theme of the march is `America arise _ no King over us,''he said earlier on the steps of the Forsyth County Courthouse inCumming, a virtually all-white community 40 miles north of Atlanta.   Forsyth County officials refused to permit him to use a podium orloudspeakers or to put up his American flag because he was denied apermit for a full demonstration.   ``Me without my flag is like Castro without his cigar,'' Barretttold Sheriff Wesley Walraven.   ``If you had a permit, we'd let you fly that little old flag allover the place,'' Walraven said.</TEXT></DOC>
