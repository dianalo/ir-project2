The characteristics of biofilmsincluding the biofilm dry density and thickness, the volumetric oxygenmass transfer coefficient, and the phenol removal rates under differentoperating conditions in the DTFB were evaluated. A phenol degradationrate as high as 18 kg/cubic metre/day with an effluent phenol concentrationless than 1 g/cubic m was achieved, signifying the high treatment efficiencyof using a DTFB.
