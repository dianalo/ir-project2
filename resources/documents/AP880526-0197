The development came in advance of Sunday's start of the Moscowsummit, at which President Reagan said he would ask Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev to encourage the Vietnamese to resolve theCambodian conflict.   From Hanoi, Kyodo News Service quoted Vietnam's defense andforeign affairs ministries as saying the pullout would cut thenumber of troops in half, or to about 50,000.   According to American estimates, the move would leave 70,000 to75,000 of Hanoi's forces battling guerrillas in Cambodia.   The withdrawal, by land and sea routes, is to take place betweenJune and December.   Communiques from the defense ministries of Vietnam and Cambodiasaid the two governments had agreed the remaining Vietnamese troopswould be placed under the command of the Phnom Penh government.   The announcements, monitored in Bangkok, were carried by radioHanoi and the official Cambodian news agency SPK.   The Soviet-armed Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in late 1978,overthrowing the regime of the Khmer Rouge and setting up apro-Hanoi government in Phnom Penh. They are fighting guerrillasbacked by China, non-communist Southeast Asian countries and theUnited States.   The 50,000 or more guerrillas, including the Khmer Rouge, aregrouped in a coalition led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the formerhead of state.   In Moscow, Deputy Foreign Minister Igor A. Rogachev saidVietnam's planned withdrawal could improve relations between theSoviet Union and China and indicates ``a political decision can bereached'' in the conflict.   ``We think this opens a direct avenue for the speedy solution tothe problems around Kampuchea (Cambodia) and for turning it into azone of peace,'' Rogachev said at a press conference.   He noted the withdrawal will eliminate two of the three issuesconsidered obstacles by the Chinese in normalizing relationsbetween the Soviet Union and China.   The Chinese have said relations will improve only when theSoviets withdraw from Afghanistan, a process begun May 15; theVietnamese end their occupation of Cambodia; and the Soviets agreeto reduce troops along the Sino-Soviet border.   The Cambodian news agency said that over the past nine years,the Phnom Penh government ``has gradually undertaken the defensework by itself, thus creating the conditions for six annualwithdrawals of Vietnamese volunteer troops from Kampuchea(Cambodia).   ``This time, the command of the Vietnamese volunteer army inKampuchea will also be pulled out ... and the remaining Vietnamesetroops in Kampuchea are to be placed under the command of thePeople's Republic of Kampuchea until their complete withdrawal in1990.''   In Tokyo, the official Radio Hanoi, monitored by Radio Press,quoted Vietnam's Foreign Ministry as announcing that outsiderswould be allowed to watch the pullout.   This year's partial withdrawal would be by far the largest ofthe six that Vietnam claims to have made since 1982. The UnitedStates says the only genuine withdrawal occurred last November,when 20,000 troops went home.   Although pledging to completely withdraw by 1990, Vietnam haswarned it will take action if Khmer Rouge guerrillas try to retakepower.   In Bangkok, a spokesman for Sihanouk, Roland Eng, said hewelcomed the announced withdrawal but said Vietnam should acceptSihanouk's proposal for an international peacekeeping force toverify the pullout and to prevent the Vietnamese and the KhmerRouge from returning.   A senior Western embassy official said Vietnam was able towithdraw forces last November because of the low level of militaryactivity in Cambodia in the past year.   The strategy of the Khmer Rouge, the most powerful of theguerrilla groups, has been to gain control of the villages andavoid direct clashes with the Vietnamese, apparently to preserveits forces for the 1990 withdrawal, he said.   He said the Vietnamese were moving into the interior, leavingthe Phnom Penh forces to guard the Thai border area, thetraditional zone of fighting.</TEXT></DOC>
