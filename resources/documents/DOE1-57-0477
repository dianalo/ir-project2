Computer-aided process planningserves as the key to this problem. A significant amount of work thatprovided a basic structure for process planning analysis has been conducted.However, in order to achieve integrated computer-aided manufacturing,the computer-aided process planning function must be totally automated.Recently, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has advanced to thepoint where AI techniques are producing encouraging results both in academiaand industry. Some of the results involve the design and implementationof expert systems, which are intelligent computer systems using domain-specificknowledge to achieve a high level of performance in the field we wouldnormally consider as requiring a human expert. The domain knowledge anda pattern-directed inference mechanism with a concurrent rule-firingconcept is implemented in PROLOG. The system contains a machined surfaceidentifier, a knowledge base, a backward-inference engine, a machiningdata-selection module, an automated NC part program generator, and aneffective relational data base manager.</TEXT></DOC>
