SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The recent string of accidents aboard Navyvessels may just be due to bad luck, rather than a lack of trainingor poor equipment, congressional military experts say.   But one civilian specialist who's studied hazards aboardaircraft carriers warns that budget cuts in Navy training couldlead to more accidents.   ``Congress is always trying to cut training budgets. But if apilot can't practice flying, those on the deck don't get trainedeither. ... It's a prescription for an accident,'' said KarleneRoberts, an industrial psychologist participating in a five-yearstudy of Nimitz-class aircraft carriers and hazardous industrialsystems.   Overall, Ms. Roberts said, the Navy's safety record ``isexcellent.''   From Sunday's jet crash aboard the aircraft carrier USSLexington that claimed five lives to Wednesday's fire aboard theoiler USS Monongahela, the week has brought a series of accidentsthat has left Navy brass shaking their heads.   ``Operating at sea is an arduous life, and the lesson is thateven at peace time there are dangers,'' said Rear Adm. Brent Baker,the head of the Navy's information division.   ``That's no consolation to the families who have lost sons ordaughters. But those who have been around the Navy a long timerealize that's why we train so hard and emphasize safety. ... Youcan't prepare for war at the pier,'' said Baker.   The admiral called the string of accidents ``frustrating. It's areal streak of bad luck.''   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on theSenate Armed Services Committee who served as undersecretary andsecretary of the Navy for five years, called the incidents ``anextraordinary grouping of unrelated accidents.''   ``Unquestionably we have the finest Navy in the world. We havethe best equipment, the best training that money can buy,'' Warnertold reporters.   Warner called charges that Navy personnel were too young fortheir duties ``nonsense.'' The senator said that when he served inthe Navy during World War II, many of the personnel were 17 yearsold and some could not read or write.   Ms. Roberts, a professor of business at the University ofCalifornia at Berkeley, said that while the sailors are young _averaging usually 20 years of age _ they are trained for specificjobs through ``a repetitive system that demands attention to safetyand accountability.''   The Navy released figures saying that since the beginning ofthis year, there have been 101 ``operation and training related''fatalities throughout the service.   However, included in this number are the 47 fatalities thatresulted from the explosion on board the USS Iowa. Excluding those,there have been 54 fatalities this year, the Navy said.   The Navy counted 64 operation and training related fatalities in1984; 61 in 1985; 56 in 1986; 72 in 1987, and 63 in 1988.   Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., chairman of the House ArmedServices subcommittee on seapower and strategic and criticalmaterials, said ``these tragic, these sad'' events are ``not insubstance very much connected.''   Bennett said the incidents of the past week could be viewed as a``product of bad luck, but that doesn't mean we can't use them toprepare for the future.''   In the latest incident, the Navy reported that nine sailorssuffered smoke inhalation and four of those were treated for burnsfollowing an early morning fire in a boiler aboard the USSMonongahela, some 500 miles west of Gibraltar.   The others include:   _Three sailors and a reported $4 million worth of non-nuclearmissiles were swept by a wave from the aircraft carrier USSEisenhower near Cape Hatteras, N.C. on Tuesday, with one sailorstill missing and presumed dead.   _A sailor aboard the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson fell intothe Pacific about 620 miles north of Wake Island late Monday andwas presumed lost.   _A F@A-18 pilot dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided missilecruiser USS Reeves in the Indian Ocean also on Monday, causingminor injuries to five sailors and blowing a five-foot hole in theship's bow.   _In the week's most deadly event, a jet pilot making his firstlanding on an aircraft carrier crashed into the USS Lexington inthe Gulf of Mexico on Sunday, killing him and four others on thedeck of the huge ship.</TEXT></DOC>
