Why is all this hatred, all this fanaticism directed at us? Next week, two excellent shows --one a TV movie, one a documentary --examine the reasons.    Islam, the dominant faith in the Mideast, is the fastest-growing religion on earth, now numbering almost one-quarter of the world's population. &quot;The Sword of Islam&quot; (Jan. 12 at 9 p.m., on PBS; in New York, Jan. 13 at 10 p.m.) studies the religion by observing the violent fundamentalist wing currently on the rise. Six centuries after the Crusades, Moslem warriors are once again preparing for battle with the West.    The 90-minute documentary focuses on two of the most extreme groups --the Jihad in Egypt (responsible for Anwar Sadat's assassination) and Hizbollah in Lebanon (responsible for the bombing of the U.S. Marine base, the hijacking of TWA Flight 847, and the majority of the recent kidnappings).    Shot under the most dangerous of conditions, &quot;The Sword of Islam&quot; offers indepth views of the two radical groups gleaned from sitting in on their councils of war, interviewing their members, even witnessing a Hizbollah unit in action, as it storms an Israeli-occupied fort. It's no surprise that producer/director David Darlow and his British Granada TV team won the International Emmy for this documentary --they deserved it for bravery alone.    But &quot;The Sword of Islam&quot; is not just gripping; it's also intelligent. First it chills the blood with glimpses of young, hotheaded Moslems ready to fight the Holy War, ready to die. (&quot;Islam is a tree that drinks the blood of martyrs,&quot; intones one Jihad member. &quot;Islam will take over the world.&quot;) Then, in clear, concise terms, it offers some explanations.    The roots of the unhappiness are, as always, financial. Dirt-poor Middle Easterners, living in rodent-infested shacks, had their noses rubbed once too often in the luxury and Western pretensions of their leaders. From this inequity came envy, frustration and finally rage.    The anger found its natural expression in Islam, a stern faith (especially the Shiite brand) born of sorrow, suffering and martyrdom. Islam gave a dignity to the people's poverty, transformed their resentment into a &quot;sacred rage.&quot; It also gave them someone to blame for their misfortune --the &quot;corrupt,&quot; prosperous West. &quot;The U.S. is the Great Satan,&quot; says one Moslem fundamentalist. &quot;They're vampires. They're not human.&quot;    The tone of &quot;The Sword of Islam&quot; is gloomy and depressing --perhaps too much so. Where, in all this footage of blood and carnage, is the 80% or 90% or more of the Moslem world that is peaceful and stable? Where are all the moderates? The documentary pays them some lip service, but we never really see them. We do, however, come away with an all-too-clear understanding of the anger and the envy that gnaws at radical Moslems.    ---   Tackling complex socio-political issues may be the bread and butter of documentaries, but it always comes as a surprise when a TV drama does it, and does it with finesse. &quot;Terrorist on Trial: The United States vs. Salim Ajami&quot; (Jan. 10 at 8 p.m., on CBS) traces the fictional story of one Palestinian terrorist (played by Sam Davi), a grim, pock-marked man in the Abu Nidal mold. Abducted abroad, he is brought to stand trial in an American court for the murder of five tourists.    While Ajami freely admits to the killings, he refuses to acknowledge the American court's jurisdiction. If anything, he says, he should be tried by a military tribunal, as a prisoner of war --a soldier trying to bring world attention to the plight of his homeless people.    Murderer or freedom fighter? &quot;Terrorist&quot; unlocks a series of difficult, emotionally charged questions. To their credit, screenwriters Richard Levinson and William Link sidestep none of them. &quot;Terrorist on Trial&quot; is the last collaboration of the pair (Mr. Levinson died in 1987) that created such award-winning issue-oriented dramas as &quot;The Execution of Private Slovik&quot; (World War II desertion), &quot;My Sweet Charlie&quot; (race relations), and &quot;That Certain Summer&quot; (homosexuality).    True, there are flaws in &quot;Terrorist on Trial.&quot; Character takes a back seat to polemics, especially in some of the preachy courtroom scenes. There are several heavy-handed pats on the back for the American system of justice (&quot;the best system in the civilized world&quot;). And the camera work is inconsistent, starting with an intriguing, quasi-documentary approach (complete with camera jiggle) that disappears halfway through.    But none of these minor flaws takes away from the achievement --the depth --of &quot;Terrorist on Trial.&quot; The drama allows the gray areas to stay gray. Salim Ajami is a cold-blooded killer, but he is also a fighter for his homeland.    Defense lawyer Simon Resnik (Ron Leibman) can view Ajami as &quot;scum,&quot; but still defend his right to a trial. Resnik (modeled on the sexy, confrontational media darling defense lawyer that consultant Alan Dershowitz imagines himself to be) is both a publicity hound and a principled man obsessed with due process.    Even the U.S. government is both right and wrong --right for bringing a murderer to justice, wrong in its methods (invading another nation's territorial sovereignty to abduct someone).    One message, however, does come across without equivocation in both &quot;The Sword of Islam&quot; and &quot;Terrorist on Trial&quot;: People who have lost all they own, people who have lost their land, their hope, people with nothing left to lose --they are the most dangerous. These two shows leave us with an uneasy appreciation of the passions in the Middle East --a frightening glimpse of the &quot;tree of blood.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
