Self-similar, scale invariantwave functions-solutions of the scale invariant Hamiltonian-representstates of long range correlations. These intrinsically correlated statescan be observed as carriers of super-current. The conformal invariantstring theory is proposed as a first approximation to describe the mechanismof high-temperature superconductivity. (author) 8 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
