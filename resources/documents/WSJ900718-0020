Because one-timeitems boosted Upjohn's earnings, however, that company'sresults generated some investor disappointment.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Upjohnshares fell 50 cents each, to $41.50. Pfizer closed up $1.125at $69.25. Despite its strong earnings, Lilly closed down87.5 cents at $88.875.                                                                                                          Eli Lilly andamp; Co.                                                                                                          Record-high world-wide sales contributed to the surge insecond-quarter earnings for Lilly. The Indianapolispharmaceuticals giant said the rapid growth of itsanti-depressant Prozac paced sales, which grew 24% to $1.225billion from $986.6 million a year ago.   Lilly said that among other contributors to its growthwere the anti-ulcer drug Axid, the antibiotic Ceclor, andHumatrope, the growth hormone that earlier this month wasreported to decrease the debilitating effects of aging.   The company's medical-instrument systems segment hadanother strong quarter, led by the Cardiovascular Systemsunit, which is benefiting from regulatory difficultiesencountered by a competitor.   The company said cancer diagnostics led to increased salesin its Hybritech unit for the quarter. Lilly's acquisition ofPacific Biotech Inc., a developer of immunodiagnostic-testingproducts, also was completed during the second quarter.   &quot;This is a very high quality {earnings} quarter,&quot; saidJerome Brimeyer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds. Heattributed the drop in Lilly's stock yesterday to eitherlarge profit-taking or reaction to rumors of a suit involvingthe drug Prozac.                                                                                                          Upjohn Co.                                                                                                          Upjohn, helped by one-time items, reported a jump inearnings from the previous year. The Kalamazoo, Mich.,company posted revenue of $805 million, up 11% from $728million a year ago.   Strong sales in the U.S. and Europe, and cost-cuttingmeasures implemented in 1989 helped boost quarterly earnings,the company said. U.S. sales rose 9% to $487 million from theprevious year; foreign sales climbed 13% to $318 million.   In addition, a $43 million pension credit and othernonrecurring charges raised pretax earnings by $28 million,or 10 cents a share, the company said. The pension creditinvolved lump-sum payments to employees who took advantage ofan early-retirement program announced last year.                                                                                                          Pfizer Inc.                                                                                                          Pfizer said second-quarter sales rose 15% to $1.5 billionfrom $1.3 billion in the period a year ago.   In the quarter, Pfizer said health-care product salessurged 26% on the strength of some new products. The companysaid it received more than $165 million from sales of its newcardiovascular drugs, Procardia XL, Cardura, Minipress XL andNorvasc; the anti-fungal drug Diflucan; and the MonorailPiccolino coronary angioplasty catheter, which is used toclear arteries.   Pfizer said it expects the benefits from new products tocontinue, saying it anticipates having six new drugs approvedby the Food and Drug Administration during the next twoyears.   The company said its specialty-chemicals sales grew 4% inthe quarter, but animal-health sales were flat andconsumer-product sales dropped 2%. Specialty minerals salesfell 20% but would have increased 13% if not for the sale ofa pigments business.   ---                           1990             1989                       in       per     in       per     %                     millions  share  millions  share   chg.
