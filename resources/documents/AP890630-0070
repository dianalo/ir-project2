Bill Clements said.   ``We will not stand by and allow Texans to be preyed upon bycriminals and unscrupulous business practices,'' the governor saidin a news release Thursday. He said he was adding the law to theagenda for the special legislative session, which began last week.   Clements urged legislators to amend the law to make informationon crime victims available to the public and media, rather thanrepeal it outright. Penalties should be established for people orbusinesses that use crime victim information for commercial profit,he said.   ``Allowing the Texas Open Records Act to become the Texas ClosedRecords Act is inexcusable,'' Clements said. ``Clearly, the Texasmedia has a right, indeed an obligation, to fully and accuratelyinform the people of Texas.''   Action on the amendment proposal is not expected until next weekat the earliest.   The new law, believed to be the first of its kind in the nation,allows government agencies including police and fire departments towithhold the names, addresses and other identifying information offelony crime victims. The law has angered news organizations andconfused police.   News organizations throughout Texas have been unable to getroutine crime information, such as the names of people killed indrunken driving accidents.   State lawmakers had asked Clements to put the issue on thespecial session agenda. They said the law was intended to shieldcrime victims from sales pitches by security and alarm companies buthas been misinterpreted and misapplied.   The bill's author, Rep. Fred Blair, earlier Thursday said hewanted to repeal the law ``because of what is going on now andbecause of the future misapplication of the bill.''   Sen. Kent Caperton, a frequent sponsor of open-recordslegislation, said the bill ``just slipped through'' withoutopposition during the regular legislative session, which ended May29.   Clements signed the measure June 14. He said later that he hadn'tthought it would put crime victim information ``in seclusion.''</TEXT></DOC>
