Furthermore part of the H/sub 2/S present in naturalgases may be converted into COS if molecular sieves are used as H/sub2/S removal substances in natural gas desulphurization plants. Carbonylsulfide might then hydrolize to H/sub 2/S in the gas storage fields andtransmission lines. This paper illustrates experimental data relevantto the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reaction between carbonyl sulfideand water both at gas and gas/liquid phases. Results may suggest whethercarbonyl sulfide should be included in natural gas quality specifications.</TEXT></DOC>
