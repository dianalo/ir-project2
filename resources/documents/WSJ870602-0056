Keaton, a former director at Santa Fe International Corp., was sentenced to two months in prison for his part in a major insider-trading case uncovered in 1981.    Mr. Keaton, 63 years old, also received $11,000 in fines and five years' probation that must include 200 hours of public service each year. Despite pleas from his lawyer that Mr. Keaton shouldn't be given time in prison simply for living in the &quot;post-Boesky world,&quot; U.S. District Judge Whitman Knapp said he thought a &quot;token jail sentence&quot; would be appropriate.    Mr. Keaton, one of the few top corporate officials ever to face insider-trading charges, pleaded guilty in March to one count each of wire fraud and of failing to report a change in stock ownership to the Securities and Exchange Commission. More than four years ago, Mr. Keaton settled related civil charges by the SEC without admitting wrongdoing.    The charges involved insider trading in advance of the 1981 takeover of Santa Fe by Kuwait Petroleum Corp. Mr. Keaton bought 10,000 Santa Fe shares before the takeover; in the related SEC settlement, he gave up $300,000 representing illegal trading profits.    Though he also was originally charged with tipping others to the inside information as well, Mr. Keaton pleaded guilty to using the information only for himself. Judge Knapp formally dropped 16 other felony counts involving the alleged tipping after he imposed sentence yesterday.    &quot;You weren't just a messenger boy in a print shop who got on to how to use the computer,&quot; Judge Knapp told Mr. Keaton during the sentencing in federal court in Manhattan. &quot;You had the highest type of fiduciary responsibility you can have, except perhaps being a lawyer.&quot; He said that Mr. Keaton's insider trading, although his first offense, was &quot;clearly deliberate.&quot;    Milton Gould, Mr. Keaton's attorney, had noted that inside traders historically have only been forced to give up their illicit profits, and not necessarily to go to prison. But Judge Knapp said that too many white-collar criminals know they have &quot;a pretty good gamble&quot; in committing crimes, in that their only punishment for getting caught is to give back their profits.    Mr. Keaton, for his part, told the judge he was &quot;terribly sorry for the transgressions . . . it's an aberration to me.&quot;    He added that he's still &quot;perplexed&quot; that the Santa Fe takeover ever went through, because of political concerns and what he said was an overly high price paid by Kuwait Petroleum, a Kuwaiti government-owned concern.    Mr. Keaton could have received as much as 10 years in prison; the $11,000 in fines was the maximum allowed for the counts to which he pleaded.    Santa Fe is an Alhambra, Calif.-based oil exploration company. Shortly after Santa Fe was taken over in 1981, the SEC launched an investigation of possible insider trading and later filed civil charges that said Mr. Keaton made illegal stock profits and that he tipped a Jordanian oil consultant, Costandi Nasser, to the deal. Mr. Nasser, in turn, was charged with tipping off others. Messrs. Keaton and Nasser settled those SEC charges without admitting wrongdoing, but a 16-count criminal indictment against Mr. Nasser is still pending. </TEXT></DOC>
