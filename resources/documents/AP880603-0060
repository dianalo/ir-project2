Mohawk leaders warned however that the barricades, erectedWednesday after police raids to stem the illegal trade ofcigarettes, might reappear.   Mohawk Indian late Thursday cleared roadblocks set up acrossHighway 132 and Mercier Bridge, which connects Montreal withsuburbs on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River.   The blockades went up after 200 police officers raided thereserve and arrested 17 people for selling cigarettes smuggled fromthe United States.   After the raid, Mohawks with rifles slung over their shouldersparked an 18-wheel truck across the highway and dumped gravel onthe road, closing the major artery and bridge and causing chaos forcommuters.   The standoff continued until late Thursday. Reporters at MercierBridge said the Indians set up what looked like a machine gun.   Late Thursday, Earl Karoniakta, a spokesman for the MohawkWarrior Society, said the Mercier Bridge will remain clear ``aslong as we're not being jerked around, as long as our people arebeing treated like human beings.''   In Ottawa, a Mohawk delegate to the meeting with Canadianofficials stormed out an hour after it started calling the sessionpointless.   ``Quite clearly ... the talks were not too productive orsuccessful,'' said Joe Norton, Mohawk grand chief, after emergingfrom the meeting.   Norton said the Mohawks failed to gain a guarantee from theRoyal Canadian Mounted Police that there wouldn't be further raids.   Acting police commissioner Hank Jensen said after the meetingthe raids were the result of a long investigation, part of ``alaborious task that you don't launch overnight'' and the force willdo it again when there are ``flagrant abuses'' of the law.   The Mounties carried out the raid using search warrants and saidthey seized $450,000 worth of cigarettes bought duty-free in theUnited States.   Police said the 17 people arrested would probably be chargedwith smuggling.   Canada exempts Indians from taxation but only for goods sold toIndians. The Mohawks have been importing tax-free cigarettes fromthe United States and reselling them to non-Indians. A carton thatwould sell for $20 if taxed goes for about $14.50.   Customs officials estimate the illegal cigarette trade is worth$16 million a year at two reservations alone _ Kahnawake and theAkwesasne reserve straddling the border between Cornwall, Ontario,and Massena, N.Y.   The raid and blockade came less than 24 hours after GeorgesErasmus, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, issued awarning that frustration with the federal government's inaction onIndian concerns could lead to violence.   Canada's 387,000 Indians have pressed the government for threeyears to negotiate constitutional guarantees on Indian self-rule.</TEXT></DOC>
