The buyers that flooded the market and pushed prices for cable systems to more than $2,000 per subscriber in recent months are evaporating, according to industry executives. And with buying interest down, potential sellers also are disappearing from the market.    Cable executives say they believe the industry is almost recession-proof, but those cable companies that can afford to, such as industry leader Tele-Communications Inc., are buying back their own stock at sharply reduced prices instead of buying new systems.    Hardest hit by the sagging demand may be the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which has been trying for several months to sell the cable assets of Storer Communications Inc., the nation's fourth-largest cable system. Kohlberg Kravis acquired the operations in a leveraged buyout two years ago and had been negotiating with a group of cable operators to sell the holding company, SCI Holdings.    Talks with the cable operators, which included Tele-Communications and Time Inc., broke off three weeks ago when the two sides couldn't agree on price. With the market crash, executives involved in the talks said, it may be nearly impossible for Kohlberg Kravis to unload the cable systems, particularly at the prices of more than $2,000 per subscriber it seeks.    Kohlberg Kravis declined comment. But John Malone, president of Tele-Communications, said the deal was in trouble before the market crash because of the heavy debt his group would have been required to assume and unfavorable tax consequences. &quot;It was like buying the last buildable lot on the Florida Gold Coast and then finding out it had been a toxic-waste dump,&quot; he said.    Mr. Malone didn't rule out an eventual purchase of the cable assets. At the moment, however, he said, &quot;If I have a choice of spending $1 billion to buy my stock and the stock of other cable companies, or investing $1 billion in the KKR systems at their asking prices, there's no question now what the better deal is.&quot;    One investment banker involved in the Kohlberg Kravis transaction said the firm &quot;is certainly not going to sell at bargain prices.&quot; He predicted that a number of cable companies that had planned to sell assets will hold back rather than cut prices.    J. Patrick Michaels, chairman of the brokerage and investment banking concern Communications Equity Associates, predicted that &quot;the deals that are in motion will go ahead, but people will be much more cautious about new deals.&quot;    For example, Continental Cablevision Inc., the third-largest U.S. cable television company, signed a definitive agreement earlier this month to buy American Cablesystems Inc. for $46.50 a share, a transaction analysts valued at between $2,100 and $2,200 a subscriber.    After the market crash, Continental said it was going ahead even though American's stock was trading in the mid-30s last week. A Continental spokesman said the company remains confident the merger will go through, but he said it also is buying American shares in the open market.    Essex Communications Corp., meanwhile, said in August that it had received several proposals to acquire its 42 cable systems serving 63,000 subscribers. One industry executive familiar with the proposals said they now are &quot;in trouble.&quot; Essex, which also has four affiliated partnerships serving 62,000 subscribers, declined to comment.    John Waller, a cable systems broker representing Essex, also declined to comment on his client. But he said that his firm hasn't seen any major slippage in transactions, particularly in the so-called &quot;private market&quot;-sales of individual cable systems between companies or groups that aren't tied to public company stock prices.    &quot;The smaller deals still are going ahead because they are based on bank debt and equity&quot; rather than junk-bond financing, he said. &quot;If interest rates go up and the debt markets go through turmoil, any deal involving cable is going to have difficulty,&quot; he added.    ML Media Partners, a limited partnership fund that raised $190 million two years ago to buy cable and other media properties, had planned an additional $100 million offering next month. That offering will be put off until at least January.    I. Martin Pompadur, general manager of ML, said the group still plans to go ahead with a recently announced plan to buy some cable systems with the backing of General Electric Co.'s General Electric Credit Corp. But he said his group is taking a tougher stand on the prices it is willing to pay for systems. He predicted many would-be sellers will keep their properties off the market for now.    Cable operators argue that even in a severe economic downturn, cable can continue to prosper because people will stay home more. With subscriber fees averaging $8 to $15 monthly, the argument goes, cable offers a good entertainment value. &quot;We're still bullish on cable and we're willing to put substantial values on it,&quot; says Tele-Communications' Mr. Malone. &quot;But right now there's a lot of uncertainty in the market, and there's going to be a hiatus period.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
