What I'm interested in is current events. ... We've got to moveon.''   The trial of Raymond Buckey, 30, and his mother, Peggy McMartinBuckey, 62, hit the two-years-and-four-days mark Thursday,surpassing by one day the Hillside Strangler trial of Angelo Buono.But the McMartin trial is months from conclusion, and attorneys sayit is unlikely to end before 1990.   Testimony from 99 witnesses has filled 50,000 transcript pages,and Los Angeles County says the proceedings have cost about $15million.   Buckey spent more than four years in jail before he recently wasable to post bail.   The mother and son, accused in 65 combined counts of conspiracyand child molestation, are the only remaining defendants in a casethat began five years ago with seven people charged. Chargesagainst the other five were dismissed after the district attorney'soffice concluded there was insufficient evidence.   The case drew national attention when it broke with allegationsof nursery school children being raped, sodomized, then terrorizedinto silence by satanic rites and animal mutilations by teachers.   But as the case was pared down, doubts were raised about whetherthe children had been coaxed into describing events that hadn'thappened, to please their adult interviewers.   A preliminary hearing took 18 months. At trial, the prosecutionspent more than 14 months presenting testimony from 61 witnessesincluding nine children who claimed they were raped, sodomized orforced to have oral copulation.   The defense is in the sixth month of its presentation, which hasfeatured testimony from former teachers and students who testifiedthey never saw children molested at the school.   The judge, whose temper has flared repeatedly in recent weeks,took drastic action to cut down testimony after jurors begandropping out of the case and some appeared to be nodding off duringtestimony.   Two weeks ago, he slashed eight witnesses from the defense caseand warned that he would do whatever is necessary to ensure thatthe trial reaches a verdict.   ``I have an obligation to see that it's a fair trial and that itgets to a jury that's still there,'' Pounders said. ``I amdesperately concerned that we are not going to have a jury tocomplete this case, the most illogical case that's ever gone to ajury.''   Over the years of testimony four of the six alternate jurorshave been excused, two for medical reasons, one who was ruledinattentive to testimony and one who had career difficultiesbecause of the trial's duration.   Another juror recently reported that the company that has beenpaying his salary may go out of business, which would force him toleave the jury and look for work. Pounders was so disturbed at theprospect he said he might consider asking the county to pay thejuror's salary for the rest of the trial.   Although the strain of the long proceedings has taken its tollon all participants, Pounders has been the most visibly distraught,lashing out at attorneys and others. At a session last week, theowner of a service that he accused of delaying delivery oftranscripts became the brunt of his anger.   Pounders frequently blames defense attorney Davis for delays, towhich Davis recently responded outside court: ``If you get a judgewho goes bonkers you can lose the case, too.''   For jurors, the highlight of recent weeks was a chance to leavethe stuffy courthouse and travel 25 miles to the seaside suburb ofManhattan Beach where they visited the little school wheremolestations allegedly occurred.   The jurors strolled through the school grounds, paced offdistances from one room to another and did their own sound tests tosee if voices could be heard between classrooms.   The next day, they came to court with an enormous cake to markthe trial's two-year anniversary.   ``I thank you,'' the judge said, ``for enduring with us.''</TEXT></DOC>
