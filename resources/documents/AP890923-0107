Iran rejected Saudi allegations that the Iranian Embassy inKuwait trained and equipped the 16 Kuwaitis to carry out thebombings in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.   Tehran Radio quoted Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, Iran's spiritualleader, as saying the consequences of the executions Thursday ``willplague'' the Saudis.   He branded the beheadings ``another crime at the hands of therulers of Saudi Arabia ... These dear martyrs were killed for thecrime of supporting the Islamic republic and their love'' for Iran'srevolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died June 3.   The radio quoted Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying:``The Saudi government, with baseless allegations, is striving tocreate divisions within the Kuwaiti nation. This is against theinterests of Saudi Arabia.''   The executions of the Shiite Moslems, members of Iran's dominantreligion, appeared to scuttle recent moves aimed at restoringrelations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, where Sunni Moslemspredominate.   The two branches of Islam have feuded for centuries.   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, also vowed in astatement published in Beirut to avenge the execution of theKuwaitis.   Hezollah, the umbrella group thought to hold 16 Western hostagesin Lebanon, said the executions were ``a terrorist act and anorganized crime.   ``The deep grudge that rules the actions of the pagan regime ...will be a motive for avenging the blood of the oppressed.''   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored inNicosia, said a similar threat was made by a group calling itselfthe Organization of the Islamic Revolution in the Arab Peninsula.   In June, the group claimed responsibility for the slaying of anEgyptian driver working for the Saudi Embassy in Brussels, Belgium.Several Saudi diplomats have also been killed in recent monthsaround the world.   IRNA quoted a statement by the group saying the executions ``willfurther speed up retaliatory moves by Moslems and strengthen theirdetermination to eradicate this unholy root from the most sacredland on earth.''   IRNA also quoted an unidentified Iranian Foreign Ministryspokesman as saying that recorded confessions of the convictedKuwaitis broadcast by Saudi television were ``false allegationsdisseminated by the Saudi government.   In their confessions, the Kuwaitis said they had receivedsabotage training from Iranians in a remote area of Kuwait. Theyalso said two Iranians at the embassy in Kuwait provided them withexplosives and timing devices.   The spokesman blamed the attacks on ``mercenaries working forSaudi Arabia ... to suppress Moslems who reject Saudi control of theholy shrines.''   ``With the execution of a number of oppressed Kuwaiti Moslems theSaudi regime has further exposed its anti-Islamic nature,'' thespokesman said. He urged the world's Moslems ``to break theirsilence over these atrocities.''   Otherwise, he said, ``The Islamic world will continue to witnesstorture and bloodshed at the hands of the Saudi rulers during thehajj,'' the annual Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca.   On July 10, two bombs exploded in Mecca, birthplace of Mohammed,Islam's founder, killing a Pakistani man and wounding 16 otherpilgrims.   Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia were severly strained inJuly 1987 when more than 400 people, most of them Iranian pilgrims,were killed in clashes with Saudi security forces in Mecca duringthe pilgrimage. Saudi Arabia severed relations with Tehran in April1988, citing subversion and terrorism.   The Saudis imposed a limit on the number of pilgrims in 1988 inan effort to improve security. Iran boycotted the pilgrimage becauseits quota was cut from the usual 150,000 to less than 50,000.</TEXT></DOC>
