(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A teen-ager identified as a suspect inthe slayings of five Gainesville college students was sentencedThursday to 22 months in a prison mental hospital for beating hiselderly grandmother.   Edward Lewis Humphrey, who has a history of mental problems,also faces an assault charge in Gainesville and a 1988 attemptedrape and burglary case in Indian River County.   Public Defender J.R. Russo told Circuit Judge Theron Yawn thathe could find no public treatment center willing to accept the19-year-old University of Florida student. Private psychiatrichospitals wanted $600 to $1,000 per day to treat him, more than hisfamily could afford, Russo said.   Hospitals run by the universities of Florida, Miami and SouthFlorida refused to accept Humphrey for private commitment,partially because of his notoriety, Russo said.   Humphrey was convicted Oct. 10 on a charge of battery on aperson over age 65.   The judge imposed the maximum prison term and recommended to thestate prison system that Humphrey serve it in the CorrectionsMental Health Institution at Florida State Hospital inChattahoochee.   ``I look at it as a psychiatric care sentence,'' Russo said,adding that he doesn't think Humphrey will serve any of his time ina regular prison.   Humphrey has been labeled a suspect in the slayings of fivestudents, some of them mutilated, near the University of Floridacampus in Gainesville during the last week in August. But he hasnot been charged in those cases.   He had been jailed in lieu of $1 million bond since the beatingAug. 30 at his home in Indialantic, two days after the last twobodies were discovered in Gainesville.   Humphrey's grandmother, Elna Hlavaty told a deputy that nightthat her grandson had beaten and choked her. But at the trial, shetestified she had fallen and hurt herself in the dark.   Russo had argued for probation with temporary commitment to amental hospital, but the judge said he wanted a sentence somewherebetween probation and prison.   Humphrey's family reacted angrily to the sentence, with his79-year-old grandmother calling it a ``charade of justice.''   ``It should have been thrown out. I was never beaten,'' shesaid. ``That boy has done nothing wrong.''   ``Any hope Ed had of being a normal person has been washedaway,'' said Humphrey's 22-year-old brother, George, choking backtears.   ``It's sad to see Ed sacrificed,'' George Humphrey said.   Edward Humphrey nodded when his grandmother blew him a kiss ashe entered the courtroom but generally appeared oblivious to theproceedings and mostly stared off into space.   The judge also placed Humphrey on probation for 14 months afterhis prison term with the condition that he continue psychiatrictreatment if needed.   Humphrey was to transferred to an Orlando hospital for apsychiatric evaluation and then to the state prison system's mentalhealth hospital within the next three days, Russo said.</TEXT></DOC>
