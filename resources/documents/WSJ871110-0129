As part of the settlement, Ford agreed to review illness and injury records at all 72 of its plants from Jan. 1, 1986, as well as records at all its wholly owned subsidiaries, to assure that they comply with standards set by the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.    The auto maker paid a $305,000 penalty to settle charges that it either didn't record or improperly recorded illnesses and injuries at its plant in Hapeville, Ga. The charges, made last April, covered recording violations involving eye and back injuries, fractures, chemical exposures, strains and lacerations. OSHA said the violations occurred in 1985 and 1986.    Ford agreed to pay an additional $20,000 penalty for record-keeping violations at its St. Louis plant.    &quot;This agreement achieves prompt corporatewide abatement without the delays and expense of litigation to either the government or the company,&quot; said George Salem, the Labor Department's solicitor. &quot;Since the agreement covers all 72 Ford sites, it multiplies the benefits of OSHA's inspection efforts, covering many more employees.&quot;    In Dearborn, Mich., a Ford spokeswoman said the company didn't deny the OSHA allegations of miskept records. However, she emphasized that Ford doesn't believe work conditions at the plants are unsafe. &quot;The alleged violations pertained only to record-keeping violations and not actual hazardous work environments,&quot; she said.    Ford agreed to give OSHA a detailed plan for its records-review program next Jan. 5. The review must be completed by June. OSHA in recent months has stressed the importance of properly kept safety records, saying they not only help employers correct specific hazards, but help OSHA inspectors decide whether a fuller inspection of a particular facility is necessary. </TEXT></DOC>
