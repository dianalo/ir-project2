KarrStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTCONSTRUCTION, MATERIALS (CON)LABOR DEPARTMENT (LBR) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Labor Department proposed a record $5.1 million in fines against five companies involved in building an apartment complex that collapsed during construction at Bridgeport, Conn., six months ago.    The collapse of the twin-tower L'Ambiance Plaza apartment project on April 23 killed 28 workers and injured 10 others. It was the worst construction accident this decade.    In proposing the penalties, the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration said design deficiencies in a system for lifting concrete floor slabs, inadequate construction practices and employer &quot;complacency&quot; were responsible for the collapse of the two towers.    The Commerce Department's National Bureau of Standards, which joined in the investigation of the incident, found that the apparatus used to lift the concrete slabs didn't meet a federal requirement that it be able to hold 2 1/2 times the anticipated load it normally would have to support.    OSHA proposed fines of $2.5 million each against TPMI/Macomber, a joint venture of TPM International, Darien Conn., and George B.H. Macomber Co., Boston; and against Texstar Construction Corp., San Antonio, Texas. TPMI/Macomber was the primary contractor and project manager, and Texstar was an important subcontractor.    The agency also proposed penalties of $104,000 against Lift Frame Builders, Elmsford, N.Y., a general contractor; $10,000 against Fairfield Testing Labs, Stamford, Conn., and $1,000 against Preforce Corp., New York. Fairfield Testing and Preforce were subcontractors.    Chris Geckler, vice president of Texstar Construction, said: &quot;We have not seen the National Bureau of Standards report, so we have no comment at this time. Until we see the documentation, we have no opinion.&quot;    Spokesmen for Fairfield Testing, Preforce and Lift Frame Builders said their companies had no comment. TPM International officials declined to comment, and the company's attorneys couldn't be reached.    The OSHA charges included a number of alleged willful violations by all of the five companies except Preforce. The agency defines a willful violation as one in which an employer knew about unsafe work conditions that don't meet federal requirements, or was aware of a hazardous condition, but didn't make a reasonable effort to correct it.    &quot;It's clear that they acted in reckless disregard&quot; for safety, Frank White, deputy assistant secretary of labor for OSHA, said at a news conference. He said OSHA standards for construction in which concrete floor slabs are poured at the construction site and raised into place by hydraulic lifters, were &quot;clearly violated.&quot;    The construction concerns have 15 working days to protest the proposed fines and OSHA findings before an independent federal Occupation Safety and Health Review Commission.    OSHA has decided to re-evalute its existing standard for so-called lift-slab construction, with a view toward possibly strengthening the requirements. Mr. White said &quot;it's safe to say&quot; that new regulations will emerge.    The agency also has advised the two known concerns using the lift-slab technique in the U.S., including Texstar, to cease lifting work until their systems have been tested.    Major OSHA findings in the Bridgeport probe included conclusions that the floor slabs at L'Ambiance were lifted without adequate bracing, lifting jacks weren't secured, and two support columns were removed from the original building design, which may have increased stress on the lifting system.    Construction workers were lifting three slabs weighing more than two million pounds when the collapse occurred. One slab fell initially, causing others to collapse when weight shifted to them, and finally bringing down both towers. </TEXT></DOC>
