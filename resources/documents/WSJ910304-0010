The Environmental Protection Agency said it has sentletters to 262 pesticide manufacturers informing them of theallegations against Craven Laboratories, Austin, Texas. Theletter asks the companies to identify all Craven studiessubmitted to the agency, among other information. Inaddition, the companies are supposed to come up with waysthey could provide new data to the agency if needed.</LP><TEXT>   Linda Fisher, an assistant EPA administrator, said thatbased on current information, the agency doesn't &quot;believethere is a risk to public health or the environment.&quot; But shecalled the allegations &quot;very serious,&quot; adding that &quot;ofparamount importance is the analysis of specific chemicals toresolve questions about the safety of the {nation's} foodsupply.&quot;   The EPA has also turned the matter over to its criminalenforcement staff in Dallas and to the Justice Department.   Don Craven, the lab's president, wasn't available forcomment, the company said.   Craven conducts studies for pesticide manufacturers todetermine the amount of pesticide residues that remain oncrops. The EPA uses the studies to establish allowable levelsof residues in foods.   If it turns out that the pesticides are more prevalentthan the lab work indicated, some products might have to beremoved from the market, but an EPA spokesman said the agencydoesn't expect that to be necessary.   The allegations against Craven came to light last summeras a result of a visit to Craven by a quality-assuranceofficer of a pesticide manufacturer. The EPA conducted itsown inspection of the company in September.   Ms. Fisher said the agency has received allegationsinvolving 17 pesticides produced by 11 companies. Craven workwas also used for about 40 other chemicals that the EPA knowsof so far. She said the agency would release data on whichcrops are affected as soon as it's available.   Rick Hind, legislative director of Greenpeace's toxicscampaign, said it's &quot;mindboggling that six months later theagency hasn't been able to sort out what companies are linkedup with what lab.&quot; He blamed &quot;weak enforcement of thepesticide law and underfunding of the agency.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
