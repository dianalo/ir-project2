Chernobyl showedthat effective action can be taken to reduce the release of activityfollowing a very serious reactor accident, but at a human cost. In thispaper we examine the merits of advance planning for such control action.There is an argument that a very serious reactor accident will not happenin the UK and, therefore, that planning for one is unnecessary. Certainly,the likelihood of a disastrous accident is extremely low and the riskto any individual in the UK is small. Nevertheless, it is clear thatthe risk is very widely distributed, and this in turn gives rise to apublic concern which may not be taken lightly. One intention of thispaper is to promote a wider debate of the issue of preplanned on-siteaction for mitigating the consequences of very serious reactor accidents.Means of controlling such accidents are indicated in the paper, but theseare preliminary proposals only. A serious attempt to pre-plan such actionswill involve considerably more study than the authors have devoted sofar.</TEXT></DOC>
