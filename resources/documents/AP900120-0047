And to takeeverything away from someone who's done nothing _ it's anightmare.''   Buckey said the family has been living off her husband'searnings as an aircraft company electrical technician, her and hermother's Social Security, their daughter's teaching salary, andhelp from their church.   At a packed news conference, Buckey and members of her familytold of death threats issued in the aftermath of the verdict, andsaid they are considering moving out of Southern California.   ``My husband was threatened in court yesterday,'' Buckey toldreporters. ``They told him, `You're gonna be killed.'''   The 63-year-old Mrs. Buckey, and her son, Raymond, 31, wonacquittal of 52 felony charges on Thursday because jurors saidbizarre allegations of molestation at the McMartin Pre-Schoolappeared to be the result of coaching by parents and therapists.   A mistrial was declared on 13 other counts, all involvingRaymond Buckey. The district attorney's office will have to decidewhether to try those counts again.   The nation's longest criminal trial cost over $15 million.   The suit filed Friday names as defendants Los Angeles County,the city of Manhattan Beach, former District Attorney RobertPhilibosian, Children's Institute International and therapist KeeMacFarlane, as well as Capital Cities-ABC Inc. and its formerreporter Wayne Satz.   ``I have no idea what her intent might be,'' Philibosian said.``Similar lawsuits have been filed in the past and they are allroutinely dismissed by the courts. It's not unusual for defendantsto do this,'' he said.   Ms. MacFarlane said the lawsuit was the fifth filed against herby various former McMartin defendants, ``and every court that hasbeen asked to consider them, including the California SupremeCourt, has thrown them out,'' she said.   ``My opinion, both as a lawyer and a reporter, is that this isan entirely frivolous and groundless kind of lawsuit,'' said Satz,who often broke stories in the case in early 1984.   ``We stand by our coverage, but we have not yet seen the legalpapers,'' was the response of a Capital Cities-ABC spokeswoman inNew York.   Assistant Los Angeles County Counsel Robert Ambrose refusedimmediate comment on the suit, and Manhattan Beach City AttorneyCarl Newton was not in his office.   The lawsuit contended that all defendants joined in a conspiracyto have the McMartin defendants indicted. They were accused ofdefamation, malicious prosecution, conspiracy and violation of Mrs.Buckey's civil rights. The suit sought general damages of $1million and unspecified punitive damages.   Mrs. Buckey, who is the only plaintiff in the federal suit,appeared at the news conference with her mother, Virginia McMartinand her daughter, Peggy Ann Buckey, who both were charged in theoriginal child molestation case but had their cases dismissed.</TEXT></DOC>
