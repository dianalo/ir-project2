The suit relates to the state's May 27 denial of a permit for Arco's Coal Oil Point Project, a complex of three offshore platforms designed to produce oil and gas from reserves in state waters and related onshore processing facilities. The state cited &quot;environmental and aesthetic reasons&quot; for the denial.    Arco filed claims in July with the state and county seeking compensation for the value of proven and potential oil and gas reserves on five leases, but said the claims had been rejected.    Arco said an exploratory drilling program had been approved by the lands commission in 1980, and that the county had agreed in 1981 to permit Arco to install equipment on the ocean floor in preliminary work on the Coal Oil Point Project.    Denial of the project amounted to a &quot;taking of property, and requires just compensation to the owner&quot; by the responsible parties, Arco said. It said the county's urging of a denial of the project breached good-faith convenants with Arco.    A spokesman for the lands commission declined to comment, saying he hadn't seen a copy of the complaint. George Poppic, special counsel for Santa Barbara County, said he was surprised that the county had been named in the litigation. He said the county hadn't urged denial of the project, but had &quot;expressed concern mainly about one of the three platforms.&quot;    In addition to the damages being sought reflecting the value Arco puts on the reserves, the company estimates additional damages from the delay of the project at $6.9 million. </TEXT></DOC>
