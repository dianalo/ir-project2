<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-11-0022 </DOCNO><TEXT>Japan Research Reactor No.2 (JRR-2) is a heavy water moderated and cooledreactor with MTR-type and cylindrical type 93 % enriched uranium fuelelements. It provides a maximum thermal neutron flux of about 2 x 10/sup14/ n/cm/sup 2/ center dot sec at the power level of 10 MW. The reactorreached to its initial criticality in October 1960, and since that timeit has been used for various research and development work satisfactorily,except for about two years shutdown for repair and maintenance. In accordancewith the non-proliferation policy of the United States, the core of JRR-2will be converted to 45 % enriched uranium in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
