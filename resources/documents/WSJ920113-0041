The measure, passed 59-9, would largely deregulate NewJersey Bell Telephone, which hopes to replace much of itscopper cable with fiber-optic cables that have the capacityto carry video signals as well as voice and data over asingle line. Competing industries -- cable television,newspapers and other publishers -- have expressed concernabout phone companies' access to information andentertainment services other than telephone calls.</LP><TEXT>   The bill passed late Friday would allow state regulatorsto liberalize New Jersey Bell's rates in return for itsinvestment in the new fiber-optic lines. Assembly SpeakerJoseph T. Doria, sponsor of the bill, said the state &quot;cannotallow old and antiquated regulations to impede progress.&quot; Butconsumer advocacy groups have said previously that many ofthe proposed new services available by fiber-optic lineswould be too costly for many ratepayers, or that mostratepayers would make little use of those services.   The bill now goes to Gov. James Florio, who has previouslyexpressed strong support for the regulatory change.   New Jersey Bell is a unit of Bell Atlantic Corp. Officialsof Bell Atlantic couldn't be reached to comment.</TEXT></DOC>
