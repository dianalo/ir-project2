The Democratic Convergence, a coalition of three left-of-centerparties, announced Monday that it will choose its candidates in thecoming weeks for the March presidential elections.   The coalition includes the National Revolutionary Movement, thePopular Social Christian Movement and the Social Democratic Party.   In the past, the Christian Democratic government of PresidentJose Napoleon Duarte invited leftist political leaders toparticipate in elections, but asked the guerrillas to lay downtheir arms.   Leftist parties have boycotted previous elections, saying theirsecurity could not be guaranteed and elections formed part of aU.S.-directed counterinsurgency plan.   Guillermo Ungo, leader of the National Revolutionary Movement,and Ruben Zamora, chief of the Popular Social Christian Movement,are the president and vice-president of the DemocraticRevolutionary Front.   The front forms a civilian-military alliance with the FarabundoMarti National Liberation Front, the guerrilla army battling theU.S.-backed government.   An estimated 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in thecivil war.   Leftist civilian politicians recently said guerrilla leadersunderstand their decision to take part in the March elections.   ``Our objective in the electoral process is the promotion of apolitical and negotiated solution to the armed conflict as anindispensable condition for fulfilling the Salvadoran people's mostpressing demands,'' a communique issued by the coalition said.   ``We are convinced that our participation will bind and mobilizepeople around the objectives of social justice, democracy, nationalindependence and peace,'' the statement said.   The election likely will be a close contest between ElSalvador's two dominant parties, the incumbent Christian Democratsand the conservative Republican Nationalist Alliance.   The rightist alliance, known as Arena, gained control of thelegislature and two-thirds of the country's municipal governmentsin elections held in March.   Duarte, barred by the constitution from another term aspresident , has been diagnosed as having terminal liver cancer.</TEXT></DOC>
