A U.S.bankruptcy judge in New York late Wednesday denied a requestby creditors and claimants to block the plea agreement.   At the court hearing, Brian Smouha, the liquidator forBCCI's assets appointed by a Luxembourg court, told the courthe wanted to enter guilty pleas for the bank to severalserious financial crimes that the U.S. government says BCCIand its agents committed. These include BCCI's alleged secretacquisition and ownership of National Bank of Georgia,Independence Bank of Encino in California, and First AmericanBankshares Inc. of Washington D.C. They also includesecurities offenses involving an issue of debentures byCenTrust Savings Bank, a failed Florida savings and loaninstitution, and the evasion of U.S. taxes.   Under the proposed settlement, the liquidators for BCCIHoldings (Luxembourg) S.A. and its subsidiaries agree toforfeit all their U.S. assets, which would be split in two.Half would remain in the U.S. to help shore up financialinstitutions hurt by BCCI's alleged illegal ownership, whilethe other would be put into an international fund tocompensate the world-wide victims of BCCI's massive fraud.</TEXT></DOC>
