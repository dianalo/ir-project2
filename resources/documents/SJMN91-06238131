I'd pay for more of a show than that.&quot;;   La Russa took the blame forfailing to inspire his players but also mentioned the chasing of bad pitches,the &quot;funky&quot; swings and the hitting mistakes that are repeated over and over.Now is not the time for this, with the A's American League West pennant hopesbecoming slimmer with each loss or Minnesota victory.;   &quot;I don't know ifthere's a stage in the season you ever should have (body language),&quot; La Russasaid. &quot;That is an impression. For some guys, it means they're mediocrelyready.&quot;;   Although Joe Slusarski was guilty of the A's second poor pitchingperformance in a row (he gave up a two-run homer by Greg Vaughn and athree-run shot by Bill Spiers), weak hitting has been a consistent problemeven when the A's were sweeping California last week. They scored 11 runs inthe past five games.;   &quot;Everyone is kind of waiting for someone else to dosomething,&quot; Mike Gallego said.;   Culprits are easily found. Mark McGwire (3for his last 27) and Gallego (3 for 20) are slumping. Rickey Hendersonapparently was so wrapped up in the pennant race, he neglected to call the A'sto let them know he wasn't showing up Thursday.;   Saturday's worst examplesof clutch hitting came in the third and sixth innings.;   In the third, theA's loaded the bases against Bill Wegman, with only one out. Jose Cansecostruck out with a checked swing on a 2-and-2 pitch, and Harold Baines groundedout to first base.;   In the fifth -- with none out, Canseco on third andBaines on second -- the pathetic parade included Brook Jacoby (pop out toWegman), McGwire (flyball to left) and Jamie Quirk (grounder to third).;   &quot;Ifyou get into a bases-loaded and a second-and-third situation, you didsomething to get into it, and you should be able to do certain things to scoresome runs,&quot; La Russa said.;   &quot;We have certain guys who keep making certaintype outs. That's something we can do something about.&quot;;   Tom Trebelhorn, theBrewers' manager, thought the A's lost opportunities in the third turned theballgame.;   &quot;That was a six- or seven-run swing,&quot; he said. &quot;You've got tothink they're going to get one, two or three runs. Instead, we get four.That's deflating for them. There's not a switch that you can turn on or offfor that.&quot;;   Trebelhorn didn't notice the body language La Russa was talkingabout.;   &quot;I have the utmost respect for Oakland,&quot; Trebelhorn said, &quot;and I didnot feel really confident six up with 12 outs to go.;   &quot;With one out, I knowJose Canseco wasn't trying to strike out and Harold Baines wasn't trying toground out. So maybe Billy Wegman was throwing some pretty good pitches.&quot;;  Wegman probably was, but La Russa clearly believes the problem is deeper thanjust that.; HOW THEY SCORED;   Brewers 2nd -- Yount singled and Vaughnhomered.
