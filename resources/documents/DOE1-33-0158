Amplitude of elementary subprocesseN -andgt; e{pi}/sup 0/N has been calculated with the account of Born's mechanizmwith psevdoscalar variant of {pi}N - interaction and non Born's partconnected with PCAC and current algebra contributions. It was shown thatdifferential cross-section of this process is very sensitive for nonBorn's part of amplitude contibution.</TEXT></DOC>
