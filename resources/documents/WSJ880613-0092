But lately Motown has been playing the same old song.    It churned out compact disks of its classic songs by artists such as Marvin Gaye, the Four Tops, and Diana Ross and the Supremes. But it failed to develop successful new acts, and the attention of its owner, Berry Gordy Jr., was diverted by other entertainment ventures conducted under the umbrella of his Motown Industries.    Now Motown seems to be saying, &quot;Let's get it on.&quot; The company has all but cinched a deal to sell its record division to MCA Inc. and Boston Ventures, an investment firm that includes such heavyweights as Warner Communications Inc., News Corp., A. Jerrold Perenchio, and Norman Lear, according to record industry executives.    Motown Records is one of America's biggest and best-known black-owned companies, and its likely sale is especially poignant because of its role in popularizing music by black performers among white audiences. Music by Motown stars -- they have included the Temptations, Gladys Knight and the Pips and Stevie Wonder -- helped define an era and remains popular years after it was first recorded.    &quot;Motown is priceless,&quot; said Dick Griffey, a black recording executive who has expressed interest in acquiring the company. &quot;There's no Warner Brothers sound, no CBS sound, but there is a Motown sound.&quot;    Nevertheless, Motown is also ailing, and the buyers' willingness to pay $61 million has raised some eyebrows. Motown's annual sales after returns have slid to a mere $20 million, and the proposed sale excludes the valuable Jobete music publishing division, which holds copyrights to most Motown songs, industry executives said. MCA will put up only 20% of the cost, retaining distribution rights to Motown recordings and gaining an option to buy the rest of the company, the executives said.    MCA, Boston Ventures, and Motown won't comment.    Unlike MCA, Motown isn't among the six big companies that dominate the record business, and it also lags behind major independents such as closely held Aandamp;M Records Inc.    Mr. Gordy, a former boxer, auto worker, and songwriter founded Motown in Detroit -- the Motor City -- in 1959, and drew its talent from that city. In fact, some commentators date the label's decline to 1971, when it moved to Los Angeles to pursue movies and television. Motown's current stars are Mr. Wonder, Lionel Richie, and Smokey Robinson, who reportedly owns 10% of the business.    For MCA, meanwhile, the most relevant Motown song is, &quot;You Keep Me Hanging On.&quot; MCA last tried to buy Motown in December 1986, but talks broke down at the last minute, and this time around, arrangements for the transaction have dragged on.    One recording executive says the parties may have delayed an announcement because Mr. Wonder has the right to break his contract with Motown if the company is sold, and efforts are being made to keep him. MCA is already the No. 1 label in music by black artists.    Mr. Gordy is also said to be interested in perpetuating some ownership of his business by blacks, and Mr. Griffey hopes to have a role, perhaps through his closely held Solar Records.    If Mr. Gordy is concerned about minority ownership, he isn't alone, and the potential sale has sparked mixed feelings in some. &quot;You're happy that they got to the point where they're going to be sold to a public company,&quot; said John R. Robinson, president of the National Minority Business Council. &quot;But you're sad because it's a loss of a major minority-owned enterprise.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
