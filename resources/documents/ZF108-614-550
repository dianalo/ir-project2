(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Color PrintersandM;With color printers on the verge of becoming standard office equipment priceshave been dropping fast.andP;  The QMS Inc. ColorScript 100 Model 30, for example,carried a price tag of $24,995 about a year ago.andP;  Now it is $15,995.andP;  QMS'ColorScript 100 Model 10, at $9,995, was the first PostScript printer tobreak the $10,000 barrier.andP;  TheNEC Information Systems Inc. Colormate PS, a300-dot-per-inch color PostScript model, is $9,995.andM;Seiko Instruments USA Inc.'s CH-5500 color laser printer lists below $7,000,including Custom Applications Inc.'s Freedom of Press PostScript-compatiblesoftware.andP;  Its 35 resident fonts, four standard interfaces and potential for16.7 million colors make that a hard deal to beat.andM;An even lower-priced Seiko model, the CH-5504, goes for $8,245.andP;  AndHewlett-Packard Co.'s PainJet lists as low as $2,495 -- an outstanding deal.andM;What set off this price war in color printing?andM;One factor certainly is the enormous growth of desktop publishing andpresentation graphics.andP;  Another is that in 1989, color monitors finallyovertook monochrome monitors in sales, which translates into a large base ofenthusiastic color users.andM;Today's fast platforms can do the computations for color output much fasterthan a few years ago.andP;  Also, color printers have benefited indirectly fromthe marketing of color copiers.andP;  It seems more reasonable to invest the timeto print a perfect color original when color copies of it can be madeimmediately and inexpensively.andP;  Canon USA Inc.'s $35,000 Color Copier, forinstance, has a per-copy overhead of $2.50 to $3.andM;Hot ColorandM;The two hottest technologies in the color printer market today, ink jet andthermal transfer, are beginning to edge out dot-matrix.andP;  Newer entrantsinclude thermal dye diffusion and MEad Imaging's Cycolor process.andM;Greg Porell of Bis Cap International Inc., a market research company inNorwell, Mass., predicts the market in the 1990s will shift away fromdot-matrix printers to non-impact electrophotographic color printing,primarily ink-jet printers.andM;&quot;Impact technologies have dominated in the past,&quot; Porell said.andP;  &quot;This isshifting over to non-impact technology led by the ink jet.&quot;andP;  By 1992, hesaid, market share for serial impact printers will drop to 50 percent, andserial non-impact devices will reach a 20-percent share.andP;  Nevertheless,printer prices in the $8,000 to $16,000 range still remain out of reach formany buyers, unless they produce large volumes of presentations.andM;By far the greatest use of color output today is for presentations.andP;  Thebest-looking presentation output comes from thermal transfer printers.andO;Ink-jet output also looks acceptable but has lower color saturation.andM;No one would claim that any color printer works fast.andP;  Still, improvementsare evident with each new printer generation.andP;  The main bottleneck has beenthe need for four printing passes, which the latest single-pass models areeliminating.andM;Colored ribbons for dot-matrix printers have had irritating drawbacks, suchas they frequently need replacing and have low resolution.andP;  And dot-matrixoperation can be objectionably loud.andM;On the plus side, dot matrix more than suffices for low-volume applicationsand costs the best to buy and run.andP;  The low end of the dot-matrix market isgrowing fastest, although printers priced below $500 really are suitable onlyfor single-user micros.andM;Some of the greatest dot-matrix improvements have come in tractor-feed paper.andO;Its perfortions have grown far less noticeable and texture and colors havemore variety.andM;The latest dot-matrix models handle paper economically, advancing to let theuser tear off a page, then rolling the paper back to prepare for the nextpage.andP;  Some models have multiple paper paths.andP;  Control panels have becomeless complicated to operate.andM;Star Micronics Inc. has introduced two 24-pin color dot-matrix printers, theXB-2415 and the XB-2410, with 16 resident fonts and only 49 decibels ofoperating noise.andM;Good dot-matrix output shows clear color differentiation and true colors, notoff-shades.andP;  The dominant color-control command sets come from Epson AmericaInc. and IBM Corp. printers; Epson JX-80 color compatibility is most common.andM;Before buying a dot-matrix color printer, check its color command setcompatibility.andP;  Also find out whether your software applications have printerdrivers that can take advantage of color.andM;The Fall of PricesandM;Falling prices for color laser and ink-jet printers probably will bring downhigh-end dot-matrix prices over the next several years.andP;  In addition, ribbonsfor transparency output, better print heads and smoother paper handling willensure continued dot-matrix popularity into the 1990s.andM;Hewlett-Packard is expected to introduce an ink-jet printer to compete withnine-pin dot-matrix printers in the coming year.andP;  Presently, the 24-pindot-matrix models compete with ink jets, lasers and their own nine-pincousins.andP;  But if 24-pin printers are to remain competitive against ink jetsand lasers, they will have to begin supporting industry standards like theLaserJet and DeskJet.andM;The price-performance of ink-jet printers continues to improve.andO;Hewlett-Packard now offers a $1,395 PainJet and a $2,495 PainJet XL.andP;  butbecause the most common output is transparencies for presentations, ink jetshave been losing market share to thermal transfer printers, whose brilliantcolor makes ink-jet output look washed out.andP;  One new advance to watch for inink-jet technology is waterproof inks.andM;Although few high-resolution ink-jet printers are sold, the technology canattain as much as 500-dpi resolution.andP;  The first 300-dpi ink-jet printer isthe Siemens Information Systems Inc.andP;  High-Print 6200.andM;Hewlett-Packard Co. ink-jet sales reportedly are growing faster than itslaser printer sales; the company now has a 90 percent share of the ink-jetmarket.andP;  Bis Cap International predicts that high-resolution ink-jet saleswill grow by 50 percent in 1990.andM;HP's black-and-white DeskJet Plus, a 300-dpi model priced at $500 with a new$150 rebate, prints two pages per minute.andP;  The same price-performanceimprovement is expected to appear shortly in HP color printers such as thePaintJet.andM;In thermal transfer printers a thermal head scans a wax ribbon and transfersthe pigment-saturated was onto the paper or transparency.andP;  A solid plasticpolymer ink melts at application.andM;Plastic crayon-based colors like those of Howtek Inc.'s Pixelmaster are bothbright and durable.andP;  Wax-based thermal transfer output, like that of theTektronix Inc.andP;  Phaser CP, is brighter than life but delicate as abutterfly's wing -- rubbing damages it.andM;From 1988 to 1989, the world market for thermal transfer printers doubledfrom 30,000 to 60,000 units.andP;  However, buyers should be aware that theseprinters leave large margins.andP;  The QMS A-size image area, for example,measures 8.11 inches by 8.91 inches.andP;  Only the Seiko QD-5500 has a full-sizeimaging area of 8.2 inches by 10.7 inches.andM;New Shades of PrintingandM;New color printing technologies continue to appear.andP;  Colorocs Corp. hasintroduced a color model based on plain-paper xerographics.andP;  It produces300-dpi output at five color pages per minute, or 40 black-and-white pagesper minute.andP;  It accepts 11- by 17-inch paper as well as the standard 8-1/2-by 11-inch size, and includes postScript software.andM;The Colorocs laser engine creates four-color images on a photoconductor beltand lays them down on a transfer belt, which applies the built-up, four-colorimage to paper or acetate.andP;  QMS and CSS Laboratories Inc. use Colorocstechnology in some of their models.andM;The Cycolor process introduced by Mead Imaging, a subsidiary of Mead Corp.,andO;has not yet moved into color printers with any great force.andP;  Cycolor buildscolor directly into the paper with a coating of millions of light-sensitivemicrocapsules called cyliths.andP;  These react to colored light and release theirdyes when crushed by pressure rollers.andM;Cycolor also is in its infancy in the color copier market; Seiko Mead hasannounced a Cycolor 3000 copier listing for $5,995.andP;  Brother InternationalCorp. was the first to use Cycolor paper in its color copier.andM;The only barrier for Cycolor appears to be the high cost of consumables -- 65cents per letter-size copy, $1.80 per transparency.andP;  Those prices undoubtedlywill fall as demand increases.andP;  And with copiers on the market, Cycolorprinters can be expected soon.andM;One interesting new development in color printing in Braille graphics.andP;  TheHowtek Pixelmaster has a translator that converts ASCII characters intoBraille fonts, which the thermal jets lay down in four layers of plastic inkdots.andP;  Printing a Braille page costs about 10 cents.andM;Another introduction, the Honeywell Inc. colorado dry silver imagingrecorder, can reproduce computer images in near-photographic quality.andP;  Itlists at $10,500.andP;  Computer-generated or -enhanced images on a CRT exposesilver halide-coated paper, which is thermally developed at 270 degreesFahrenheit.andM;The Colorado's color calibration process is supposed to prevent colorinconsistency.andP;  Three densitometers verify that colors on the hard copy matchthe internal color palette.andP;  If deviation is detected, an electricaladjustment is made to the CRT.andM;In another technical advance, continuous-tone color printing has appeared atthe high end of the market.andP;  A printer from E.I.andP;  du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co.andO;layers transparent color dyes one over another at each pixel location.andM;Continuous-Tone QualityandM;Ordinary color printers distribute primary-color dots in a rosette patternlike a half-tone photograph.andP;  But the DuPont's output is very close tocontinuous-tone photography, with 300-dpi resolution and a full tabloid-sizeimaging area plus room for bleeds and crop marks.andP;  The $74,600 printer comeswith PostScript interpreter and SCSI interface.andM;Last year, CSS Laboratories introduced a single-pass color laser printer, theColor Magic, listing at $29,995 with a Colorocs engine.andP;  An LED array exposesa photosensitive belt, which passes the electrically charged areas underdevelopers for cyan, magenta, yellow and black.andP;  Toner transfers to a secondbelt, and then any remaining toner on the photosensitive belt is removed asit approaches the exposure array again.andM;The transfer belt places the image on paper, which passes through a fuser asit moves out of the printer.andP;  This technology achieves perfect registration,needs only a single paper pass and avoids wasting pigments.andP;  However, itprobably will be a year before more such printers are on the market.andM;For desktop publishing and computer-aided design applications, many buyerswill settle for nothing less than the Adobe Systems Inc. PostScript pagedescription language.andM;PostScript is expensive, but PostScript clones like Custom Applications'Freedom of Press and QMS' UltraScript have lower prices.andP;  With Freedom ofPress, the PC acts as the rasterizer, communicating how the image will appearon the page -- a function normally performed by the printer.andP;  SeikoInstruments' CH-5500 color thermal printer series starts at $6,245 withFreedom of Press.andM;For users who have no need for PostScript, Panasonic Communications andSystems Co. sells a non-PostScript color thermal printer, the EPL-8541, for$8,995.andM;With color monitors following three or four color display standards, usershave started to demand that their screen and output colors start matchingmore closely.andM;The safest route to good color matches is to buy software that can handle thePantone Inc. matching system.andP;  Even if the display color is off.andP;  theinformation will be processed through a Pantone color algorithm and emerge inthe correct color.andM;Practical problems caused by the lack of agreement on a color output standardare not as far-reaching as you might think.andP;  Only high-end graphicsapplications with customized colors encounter problems.andM;Radius Inc., Pantone Inc., Barco Industries Inc., RasterOps Inc. andTektronix Inc. all are working on color standards to calibrate displaysagainst printed output.andM;The $695 Radius PrecisionColor Calibrator, optical-sensing hardware andproprietary software, aims at accurate Panone color simulations.andP;  Radius andPantone jointly are developing software to standardize display of Pantonesimulations.andM;Tektronix's $50 TekColor color-fidelity software can pick out screen colorsthat have exact matches on a Tektronix printer.andP;  But such products remainproprietary tools -- what users really want is a standard.andM;Ron Mileikowsky is a computer consultant in Potomac, Md.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
