Model building studies based on the crystal structure of thepsoralen-thymine monoadduct suggest that each cross-link bends the DNAdouble helix by 46.5{sup 0}. Here the authors use gel electrophoresisto test the validity of the current models. They have synthesized a seriesof DNA fragments (21-24 base pairs in length), each containing one uniqueT-A site for 4'-(hydroxymethyl)-4,5'8-trimethylpsoralen (HMT) cross-linking.Because of an estimated 28{sup 0} unwinding of the helix by HMT, oneexpects that the 22-bp cross-linked fragment will be repeated nearlyin phase with the average helical screw when multimerized. In that sequenceligation will maximally amplify any deformation to the double helix.They find that the ligated multimers of cross-linked DNA migrate closeto the multimers of non-cross-linked DNA on polyacrylamide gels. Theseobservations place an upper limit of 10{sup 0} on DNA bending inducedby psoralen cross-linking and indicate unwinding by about 1 bp, as wellas stiffening of the double helix. These properties are not unexpectedfor classical intercalators.</TEXT></DOC>
