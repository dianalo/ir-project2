Clarence Thomas, on the doorstep of the SupremeCourt, has been pulled down by a Washington establishmentdetermined to make him understand that conservatism in thattown carries a cost, as it has for so many individuals since1980. Elliott Abrams, who in his years in the StateDepartment did as much as anyone to create a new world orderof democratic self-determination across Latin America, wasbrought down by Lawrence Walsh. What an awful, lurid placethe American capital must now seem to the rest of thecountry.   As we went to press it appeared that Judge Thomas would berequired to restore his reputation by proving the unprovable.No court at any level in the United States would entertainthis uncorroborated accusation. Washington, having become onebig kangaroo court, will do so with glee. One can only hopethat Judge Thomas -- and apparently his only uncowedpolitical defender, Sen. John Danforth -- will prevail overthe grim forces arrayed against him. (At Kennebunkport theday of the nomination, President Bush asked Judge Thomas ifhe and his family were prepared to endure what was to come.We imagine Judge Thomas, in assenting, took this to mean thatMr. Bush would remain on the front lines.)   Does one need a flavor of what is going on here? Fancythis. Yesterday afternoon, as it was becoming apparent thatthe vote would be delayed, who should rise on the floor ofthe Senate to speak but the distinguished senior Senator fromMassachusetts, Edward Kennedy. This is what Teddy said:   &quot;If members of the Senate ignore Professor Hill's seriouscharges, if the Senate votes on this nomination withoutmaking a serious attempt to resolve this issue, the Senatewill bring dishonor on this great body. . . . If ProfessorHill's allegations are true, Judge Thomas denied ProfessorHill her right to work free from sexual harassment.&quot;   The Democratic Party is now led by the likes of this andsuch figures as Howard Metzenbaum and Howell Heflin. It isintriguing to contemplate the political ramifications of theparty of Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnsonnot only trying to defeat a distinguished black American fromsitting on the Supreme Court but destroying his person aswell. In another time, there would have been party wise mento warn against going this far, but today the Democratsderive their wisdom from Ralph Neas, Kate Michelman and PaulSimon.   In pleading, Elliott Abrams has at least managed to freehimself from the peculiar hellishness of the place.Congress's robotic Terminator, Lawrence Walsh, had pinned Mr.Abrams into a Hobson's choice and got the guilty plea. Mr.Abrams's alternative was to spend a minimum of $1 milliondefending himself against a $100 million, taxpayer-fundedprosecution. Mr. Walsh was determined to get someone from theState Department, so he got what he wanted. And because Mr.Abrams had spent his years in the Reagan administrationbluntly and publicly criticizing Congress's policies andindirectly the permanent Washington establishment, they bothgot what they wanted: Elliott Abrams on the front pages withthe words &quot;Pleads Guilty&quot; appended.   Well, if character still counts for anything inWashington, we suspect that Mr. Abrams's reputation willsurvive this.   History can judge Mr. Abrams, but we have some preliminarythoughts. Congress and the Walsh operation during this periodare tied forever to one phrase -- Iran-Contra. That was theirchoice. By comparison, Mr. Abrams has a legitimate claim as amajor architect of the new democratic structure of LatinAmerica.   He worked, spoke and wrote tirelessly on behalf ofdemocratic self-determination throughout the continent, andhe helped keep the Contras alive body and soul until DannyOrtega was forced to accept free elections. Mr. Abrams urgedthat U.S. policy separate itself from Panama's ManuelNoriega. He pushed for a plebiscite on General Pinochet, andwas the first member of the U.S. administration to opposeMarcos.   Both Judge Thomas and Mr. Abrams came to Washington toperform public service. In the same week, Washington has nowtried to destroy both of them. It is of course useful todenounce what the city has become, but in the interests ofpreserving the system, more than a few people better startactively fighting back against the worst of it.</TEXT></DOC>
