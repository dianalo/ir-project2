(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After months of debate, the U.S. EnergyDepartment has decided not to restart the flawed and aging NReactor, one of four reactors supplying the U.S. nuclear arsenalwith bomb-grade plutonium.   The N reactor has been closed since January 1987 for about $70million worth of safety improvements prompted by the nucleardisaster that killed 31 people at the similarly designed Sovietnuclear plant at Chernobyl.   Energy Secretary John Herrington announced Tuesday the reactorat the Hanford nuclear reservation will be placed on ``coldstandby'' status, forcing about 2,600 workers to be laid off in thenext two years.   ``This decision signals the end of the plutonium productionmission at the Hanford site,'' said Mike Lawrence, Hanfordoperations manager for the Energy Department.   Plans for the mothballing of the reactor will be included in theReagan administration's proposed budget that will be sent toCongress Thursday.   A report prepared last year for the Energy Department projectedthat a gradual phase-out of plutonium-producing operations atHanford by 1996 would result in the loss of more than 13,800 jobsin the state.   Gov. Booth Gardner and members of the state's congressionaldelegation pledged to seek a way to cushion the economic shock.   But Sen. Dan Evans, R-Wash., said, ``Frankly, the most likelytype of aid to come will be unemployment benefits.''   Herrington said the decision to mothball the reactor was basedon a secret Department of Defense review of the nation's futureneed for plutonium, a key ingredient in nuclear weapons.   The Energy Department said demand for plutonium could be met bythree reactors at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C., andthrough plutonium recovery from nuclear weapons retired as a resultof the recent U.S.-Soviet treaty.   The Savannah River reactors are running at 50 percent powerbecause of safety concerns.   The N Reactor, operated for the Energy Department byWestinghouse Inc., shares several design characteristics with theChernobyl plant, including graphite in the reactor core to moderatenuclear fission and lack of a containment dome.   U.S. officials say the N Reactor, operated for the EnergyDepartment by Westinghouse Inc., was considerably safer than theone at Chernobyl.   The fate of the reactor, the last of nine plutonium producersthat have operated at Hanford since 1944, had been mired incontroversy. Proponents said the nation needed the plutonium whileopponents contended it did not, and that the reactor was unsafe.   The ``cold standby'' status will begin next year shortly afterthe safety improvements are completed and tested. The reactor couldbe restarted, but that would take up to three years, Lawrence said.   The N reactor employs 3,300 of Hanford's 14,000 workers. Thesite is the biggest employer in the nearby cities of Richland,Kennewick and Pasco, which have a combined population of about130,000.   ``State agencies will do everything they can to help those whowill be affected by the shutdown,'' Gardner said.   Rep. Don Bonker said he and Sen. Brock Adams, both Democrats,planned to introduce a ``military waste cleanup bill that we hopewill provide thousands of high-skilled jobs.''   Over 40 years of defense wastes are temporarily stored in tanksat the site. Under cold standby status, fuel will be removed fromthe reactor and inspection and maintenance programs continued, theEnergy Department said.   Related plutonium processing plants, which employ more than3,000 Hanford workers, will be gradually phased out in the 1990s asthe stockpiled plutonium is exhausted, Lawrence said.   The decision to close the reactor ended a period of uncertaintyfor local officials and plant workers.   ``I'm just glad that we finally know what the decision is,''said Richland Mayor John Poynor. ``We'll survive this and come outstronger for it.''   ``The reality of it hasn't hit home yet,'' said Stan Waggoner,an N Reactor technician who learned of the decision as he came offthe afternoon shift Tuesday.   Hanford was built in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project toproduce atomic bombs. The N Reactor began operations in 1963.   At more than 4,000 megawatts of thermal power, the N Reactor hasthe highest operating power of any U.S. reactor.</TEXT></DOC>
