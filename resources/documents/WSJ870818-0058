Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FINBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><TEXT>   Federal thrift examiners believe Financial Corp. of America has significantly more problem loans than it has reported and could force the company to boost its loan loss reserves, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.    Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp., troubled parent of the nation's largest thrift, cautioned in its quarterly SEC filing that the examiners haven't completed their review of loans, and that the federal rules for classifying thrift problem loans may change before the examination is finished, resulting in a less negative assessment.    However, any move by the examiners to require Financial Corp. to increase loss reserves would add to the company's mounting losses, reduce its already thin capital base and increase the pressure for a government-assisted acquisition of the company.    Also in the SEC filing, Financial Corp. said it is discussing the settlement of two pending SEC investigations of its accounting practices from 1980 to 1986 on terms that wouldn't require restatement of any previously reported financial results.    In its SEC filing, Financial Corp. said that in June, it received some preliminary evaluations of its loan portfolio made in connection with a regular federal examination that began in March 1986. The evaluations include a review of loss reserves and so-called &quot;scheduled items,&quot; which regulators use to gauge a thrift's problem loans.    Financial Corp. said that if it had included results of the examiners' preliminary evaluation in its June 30 financial statement, the total of scheduled items &quot;would have increased significantly&quot; from the $1.38 billion reported.    The preliminary review also indicated that Financial Corp. would be required to put up additional loss reserves in some cases, while in others its reserves are larger than necessary, the filing said.    Financial Corp. has provided more information to the examiners, and said that &quot;an indication of the ultimate additional loss reserves, if any, will not be forthcoming&quot; until the examiners finish reviewing that information.    A Financial Corp. spokeswoman yesterday declined to estimate the relative size of the under-reserving or over-reserving indicated in the examiners' preliminary review. &quot;It's really too preliminary to begin quantifying numbers publicly because we don't wish to mislead anybody,&quot; she said.    In its SEC filing, Financial Corp. noted that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates thrifts, proposed in May to change some regulations used to determine scheduled items. Also, Financial Corp. said that the banking bill that President Reagan signed last week requires the Bank Board to change some regulations on scheduled items and loss reserves. Financial Corp. said it couldn't determine the impact of such changes on the examiners' preliminary findings.    Souring loans have been a major source of Financial Corp. woes since 1984. From August 1984 to March 1987, current management put up more than $1.15 billion of loss reserves on loans made under the firm's former chairman, Charles W. Knapp, but added $165.5 million more to reserves in the 1987 second quarter, resulting in a $176.6 million loss for the period. The loss cut net worth -- assets minus liabilities -- by 56%, to $140.3 million, or 0.4% of the company's assets of $33.91 billion.    In its SEC filing, Financial Corp. also changed its previous explanation of the second-quarter increase in loss reserves. In the filing, it said the increase &quot;resulted from continuing deterioration of condominium properties being rented as apartments,&quot; predominantly in California.    Previously, Financial Corp. said a major cause of the reserve increase was a change, adopted in April by accounting rule makers, in the accounting treatment of renegotiated loans. The company spokeswoman said yesterday that the accounting change turned out to be less of a factor than the company expected.    Financial Corp. also said in the filing that it continues to have problems with loans in oil-producing areas and, nationwide, with hotel and motel loans.    Financial Corp. also disclosed that it repaid $1 billion of long-term borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, reducing its borrowings from that bank to $2.1 billion. The bank borrowings were replaced with short-term borrowings from other sources that Financial Corp. said were hedged with futures contracts to reduce interest-rate risk.    Financial Corp. reported a change in the way the Bank Board figures the required capital of the company's main unit, American Savings andamp; Loan Association. The new method, which took effect in January, is 4% of liabilities, rather than 4% of liabilities plus 20% of scheduled items. The capital that American Savings now is required by the Bank Board to have is $1.3 billion, compared with the $1.7 billion calculated under the old method. However, with capital of only $414 million, American Savings still remains deficient, by $928 million.    As reported previously, the most likely source of capital is Ford Motor Co., which has proposed to the Bank Board that it take control of Financial Corp., pump in about $1 billion of capital, and receive government guarantees against certain future losses. Such a transaction could severely dilute or wipe out the interests of current Financial Corp. shareholders. </TEXT></DOC>
