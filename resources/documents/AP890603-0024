(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In 1980, five ardent U.S. environmentalistswent on a hiking and camping trip into the Pinacate mountains ofSonora, Mexico.   When they returned, they had founded a radical activist movement_ Earth First! _ epitomized by a no-holds-barred slogan: ``Nocompromise in the defense of Mother Earth!''   With a clenched fist as its logo, Earth First! mountedletter-writing efforts, staged protests, filed suits, made threatsand used theatrical and guerrilla tactics in a variety of battlesagainst developers and the lumber and oil industries.   The group has no formal structure, no official leaders, noofficeholders, no dues, no bureaucracy. Just committed supporters.   It has about 50 chapters worldwide, including the Korago Tribein the Solomon Islands of the southwest Pacific where tribesmenburned a logging camp to the ground several years ago.   Members adhere to the uncompromising philosophy espoused by themost highly profiled of its founders, David Foreman of Tucson, whowas arraigned Friday before a federal magistrate and charged withconspiracy to sabotage nuclear facilities in Arizona, Californiaand Colorado. He was freed on a $50,000 bond.   Three other Earth First! activists, Mark Leslie Davis, 39, MarcBaker, 37, and Margaret Millett, 35, were ordered held withoutbail. Foreman is charged with conspiracy; the other three face acount each of conspiracy and three types of property destruction.   Baker, Davis and Millett were committed to attacks on the PaloVerde and Diablo Canyon nuclear complexes of Wintersburg, Ariz.,and San Luis Obispo, Calif., respectively, and the Rocky Flatsnuclear weapons center near Denver, according to FBI testimonybased on tape-recorded conversations.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Roger Dokken told the federal magistratethat Foreman was the ringleader.   ``Mr. Foreman is the worst of the group,'' Dokken said. ``Hesneaks around in the background. He was the financier, the leader,sort of the guru to get all of this going. I don't like to use theanalogy of a Mafia boss, but they never do anything either. Theyjust send their munchkins out to do it.''   If convicted, Foreman faces five years in prison and a $10,000fine; the others each could be sentenced to 35 years and fined$80,000, the FBI said.   Earth First! adheres to a concept called deep ecology, whichmaintains wilderness, endangered species and wild plants andcreatures should be preserved for their own sake.   In a December interview, Foreman said the group's job is tochallenge people to live up to higher standards.   ``I think we redefined the debate,'' he told The Arizona DailyStar. ``The media had stopped covering the environment because itwas boring. We made it interesting again.''   Demonstrations led by Earth First! included one at the GrandCanyon where members performed a skit in anti-radiation suits toprotest against a proposed uranium mine.   Members dressed as birds, squirrels and coyotes dropped dollarbills on federal Park Service officials' heads during a Phoenixhearing on flights over Grand Canyon.   They also staged a ``die-in'' at the Phelps Dodge Corp.'s nowclosed smelter in Douglas, where members wearing gas masks climbedthe smokestacks in opposition to the air pollution it caused.   There have been confrontations, such as where Foreman put hischest against the front of a moving pickup truck in trying to blockconstruction of a logging road in Oregon's Siskiyou National Forest.   Foreman published a book in 1985 titled ``Ecodefense: A FieldGuide to Monkeywrenching,'' which reportedly has sold more than11,000 copies. It is an illustrated and detailed primer on how tobattle timber and land-developing interests.   His book offers instructions on such actions as putting spikesinto trees to discourage loggers with chain saws, knockingbulldozers and helicopters out of order by putting sand in engineoil, pulling up survey stakes and trap lines, downing billboards,cutting fences, closing wilderness-area roads and topplingpower-line towers.   Its genesis, and that of Earth First!, was a 1975 novel by thelate Edward Abbey, ``The Monkey Wrench Gang,'' about a group of``eco-raiders'' who unsuccessfully plot to blow up the Glen CanyonDam that blocked the Colorado River and created Lake Powell.</TEXT></DOC>
