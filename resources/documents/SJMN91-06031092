I noticed stores are carrying the drinkagain, but those of us who sent in proof of purchase for a voucher forreplacements still are waiting. I've lost the company's address. Could youhelp?;    -- Mrs. Jo Tagg, Portola Valley  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SPRINGING TO THE RESCUEOF KOALA COMPLAINERS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Action Line  </MEMO><TEXT>  A  You should be receiving those vouchers in the mail within the next week anda half, says a spokeswoman for Koala Springs International. After the Novemberrecall of the beverage, consumers were asked to attach either the UniversalProduct Codes from bottles, or receipts for can purchases, to 3-by-5 indexcards with their names, addresses and telephone numbers and to send them to aspecific address by Dec. 31. The fulfillment house hired by Koala Springs heldthe early requests so it could mail all the vouchers at once, the spokeswomansays. Because the fulfillment house's post office box is closed, that addressis no longer good. Instead, readers who have followed the recall instructionsand have not received their vouchers by Feb. 11 should write Action Line andinclude any photocopies of receipts or Universal Product Codes available withtheir letters. We will forward them to Koala Springs for investigation.;    Don't shoot, we've paid; Q  I bought a set of custom tire rims in 1987, whileI was living in Oregon. The account was financed by Bank One in Dayton, Ohio,and I made payments for about a year. I moved to California in August 1988 andstopped making payments because I was unemployed. The account was turned overto a collection agency, but in July my father paid off the account in full. Isent a copy of the canceled check to the collection agency this past fall.However, the collection agency continues to send me threatening letters andannoy me with phone calls on the average of once a week. Is there any way toget the company to leave me alone?;    -- Patrick Heaney, San Jose; A  Wecontacted Bank One, which has advised the collection agency to close itsaccount. You've been given a toll-free number to call Bank One if you have anymore problems.;     A complaint supported; Q  I am enclosing a copy of thechild support warning notice from the Santa Clara County District Attorney'sOffice family support division and a copy of the document releasing my husbandfrom the arrearages by the Burke County General Court of North Carolina. Weare still getting these warning notices and bills, although we have mailedfour copies of the legal papers to a San Francisco address provided and onecopy to a San Jose address. We've also tried numerous times to contact thelocal office by phone. Either there is no answer or we are put on hold forextensive lengths of time. Would you look into this matter for us?;    --Elaine Mitchell, San Jose; A  We did. The Santa Clara County DA's familysupport division has contacted Burke County to confirm that your husband'scase has been closed. At North Carolina's request, Santa Clara County isclosing its case. Susan McGarry, of family support division, says the delaywas because North Carolina failed to send Santa Clara County a written requestto close the case.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910131  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  552  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday January 31, 199100031092,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
