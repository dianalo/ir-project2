Airports in England, West Germany, Italy and Belgium stepped upsecurity after receiving the warning issued by the Federal AviationAdministration. No additional precautions were reported in theNetherlands, Greece or Spain.   The Bush administration was clearly unhappy the warning hadleaked out in a front-page newspaper story in London. TransportationSecretary Samuel K. Skinner called it a potentially seriouscompromise of intelligence-gathering activities and ordered an FAAinvestigation of the disclosure.   Three Lebanese Palestinians were mentioned by name in thewarning, according to the Daily Express. The bulletin said the threemay be traveling on passports from Bahrain, Pakistan or North Yemen.   The FAA confirmed that it had issued a security bulletin toairports and carriers March 16 about ``the possibility of ahijacking of a U.S. airliner in Western Europe.''   The warning did not mention any specific airline or airport thatmight be threatened, nor did it cite any time frame for the warning,the FAA said.   Disputing the Daily Express accoun, U.S. officials emphaticallydenied that the notice had been relayed to U.S. diplomats andmilitary personnel abroad while being withheld from the public atlarge _ as was the case with a warning prior to the bombing of PanAm Flight 103, which killed 270 people on Dec. 21.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said last week'swarning was intended to heighten ``the already high securityprocedures now in effect'' and was not designed for publicdistribution. He said the alert was directed to authorities ``whocan direct responses to the threat.   ``Travelers on U.S. air carriers should be confident that allreasonable precautions are being taken to insure that the highestlevel of security exists,'' he said.   On Capitol Hill, Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., chairman of theHouse aviation subcommittee, said the warning had been distributedonly among intelligence and law enforcement agents so that theycould pursue further information.   ``I'm persuaded there was not a double standard,'' he said,referring to accusations the government in the past has warned itsemployees about terrorist threats but not alerted the public.   ``As for the question (of) is it safe for American peopletraveling, yes,'' Oberstar said, citing beefed up security resultingfrom the warning. He spoke with reporters after members of his panelreceived a previously scheduled, private three-hour briefing onaviation security from government and industry officials.   The FAA would not reveal what had prompted the alert, other thanto say there had been ``sensitive information'' not designed forpublic distribution.   ``The release of this information by unauthorized persons can becounterproductive to the civil aviation community's efforts toprovide a totally effective security system,'' the FAA said.   Skinner said, ``Hopefully, no one will lose their life over this,but it is a very serious matter.''   Army Maj. Dennis Pinkham, a spokesman for the U.S. EuropeanCommand, which is in charge of U.S. military forces in Europe, saidthe command was aware of the warning but did not pass it along tomilitary personnel.   Discussing the warning at a White House briefing, Fitzwater said,``My understanding is it is similar to many, many similar kinds ofinformation and security bulletins that go out and would be, infact, lower than many because it was not given to any military ordiplomatic personnel, but rather just to security experts ... ataviation airports and airlines.''   Refusing to divulge the contents of the bulletin, Fitzwater said,``I can't comment (on) what's in this bulletin. I don't want tounnecessarily scare people or to present public information thatmight be harmful in many ways. That's the reason it's not madepublic in the first place.''   He said intelligence agencies routinely collect information aboutthe travel of terrorists or people who are on a suspect list. ``Someof this information, like all intelligence information, isquestionable. Some of it has higher value than others. ...   ``Unless it has a certain degree of authenticity or believabilityor credibility or whatever,'' he said, ``you can't go out and makegeneral warnings to the public. So that's the situation we're in.''   The Daily Express printed some of the memorandum, which read inpart:   ``Possible: 3 Lebanese Palestinians may try to hijack a U.S.airliner in Europe. Possible names: Jamel Hahmud Talid Muhammed:Ahmed Muhammad Salim Abuzayni: Khalour Muhammed Jafar.   ``Alias passports: Bahrain, Pakistan, North Yemen, possiblegenuine@forged or altered.   ``Above information credible although not confirmed.''</TEXT></DOC>
