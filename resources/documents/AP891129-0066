Scores of homes have been burned and numerous street battleshave occurred in Mpumalanga, near the provincial capital,Pietermaritzburg. The violence has included clashes between rivalblack factions and a wave of attacks on police.   Mpumalanga has been the center of an upsurge of politicalviolence throughout Natal. More than 30 people have been killed inunrest in the province this week, according to police _ one of thebloodiest periods during a three-year power struggle in which morethan 3,000 blacks have died.   The conflict is between members of Inkatha, a relativelyconservative Zulu political organization headed by MangosuthuButhelezi, and supporters of the banned United Democratic Front, amilitant anti-apartheid coalition.   Maj. Gen. J.C. Van Niekerk, police commissioner for Natal, saidtoday that additional security forces would sent into Mpumalanga.He gave no details, but there were unconfirmed reports thereinforcements would include army units.   Police headquarters said six people were killed in Mpumalanga inthe 24-hour period ending at daybreak today. These included threemen shot and killed by police who were fired on after arriving tobreak up a clash in which two other men had been killed.   Five other unrest deaths were reported in the same periodelsewhere in Natal.   Police officials have insisted their forces seek to remainneutral in the factional conflict. However, a delegation of lawyersand human rights activists which visited Mpumalanga on Tuesdaycontended that police were assisting Inkatha vigilantes.   Both Inkatha and the United Democratic Front oppose apartheid,but they differ sharply over strategy.   Buthelezi condemns the front's use of boycotts and encouragementof economic sanctions against South Africa. He also opposes theguerrilla tactics of the outlawed African National Congress, whichis aligned with the front.   Some United Democratic Front leaders depict Buthelezi as agovernment collaborator because of his position as chief ministerof the tribal homeland of KwaZulu.</TEXT></DOC>
