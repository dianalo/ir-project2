Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee announced the order under termsof the Internal Security Act, which prohibits a wide range ofactivities. It takes effect Friday and will be in force throughMarch 31, 1989.   Under national emergency regulations already in effect, outdoorrallies are illegal unless approved by a magistrate or Law andOrder Minister Adriaan Vlok.   It was not immediately clear if the latest order expandedgovernment authority to restrict rallies.   Magistrates still will have the power to consider exceptions tothe ban.   The order appears aimed at nationwide municipal electionsscheduled for all race groups in October. By restricting rallies toindoors, the government apparantly seeks to limit the size ofcrowds and reduce the potential for violence.   It is the latest move in recent government crackdowns aimed atlimiting political activity.   Last week, a judge, acting on a government request, banned anoutdoor rally by the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, awhite-supremacist paramilitary organization. The group eventuallymet indoors.   On Feb. 24, the government banned 18 leading blackanti-apartheid groups from participating in political activity.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.   Also Thursday, Minister of Constitutional Development ChrisHeunis said residents of the small black township of Oukasie,outside the northeastern city of Brits, must be resettled inkeeping with government policy.   Heunis said Monday in Parliament the government would not try torelocate the remaining 8,000 residents.   He said Thursday his statement was misinterpreted. He reiteratedgovernment policy that Oukasie remained officially abolished andresidents would be moved to Lethlabile, a newly establishedtownship 15 miles away. But he said it would not be done by``force.''   Heunis abolished Oukasie by decree in October 1986, but onlyabout 5,000 residents moved to Lethlabile. Oukasie residentsrepeatedly have said they prefer their old homes and have nointention of moving.   The government says the cost of upgrading Oukasie would be``astronomical.'' Oukasie residents say the government wants themout because the township has expanded to within 250 yards of awhite suburb in Brits.</TEXT></DOC>
