The executions ended a court-martial and appeal process thatrevealed a ring in the army and Interior Ministry engaged in drugtrafficking, black marketeering, smuggling and other crimes.   The Prensa Latina news agency said the four were executed at dawnin Cuba. In addition to Ochoa, a former army general, they includedformer Col. Antonio de la Guardia Font; former Maj. Armado Padron;and former Capt. Jorge Martinez.   They were sentenced to death last week, stripped of theirmilitary ranks and thrown out of the Communist Party.   Ochoa, 57, fought in the guerrilla war that brought Fidel Castroto power and was made a Hero of the Revolution, Cuba's highesthonor, for heading Cuba's 50,000-man expedition in Angola and anearlier one to Ethiopia. Ochoa also headed a mission to Nicaragua'sleftist Sandinista government.   The defendants appealed their sentences to the Council of State.The council's 29 members voted unanimously Sunday to uphold thedeath sentences.   Castro, giving a five-hour summation to the panel, said the fourmust face a firing squad to restore faith in the Cuban revolution,ensure discipline in the armed forces and set an example for others.   In addition to drug trafficking, they were convicted of treasonand other crimes.   The court-martial also handed out prison sentences ranging from10 years to 30 years to 10 other defendants in the case. They werestripped of rank and decorations and were dishonorably discharged.   The scandal shook Castro's government, embarrassing him and theCommunist Party. He had for years been denying U.S. accusations hisnation was being used for drug shipments, saying the reports were aplot to embarrass the revolution.   But he had to admit the accusations were true. In addition to theofficers put on trial, the transportation and interior ministershave been sacked, and there have been unconfirmed reports that otherofficials were arrested.   Castro said the drug scandal did immense internal damage, erodedCuba's international image and crippled the tourism industry it hasbeen trying to foster.   Castro accused the United States of trying to score propagandapoints on the drug trafficking issue. He also said Ochoa had stolenfrom Nicaragua and Angola, and he held him responsible for defeatssuffered by Cuban forces supporting the government of Angola againstSouth Africa-supported guerrillas.   Instead of sharing information on drug smuggling, Castro said,the United States engaged in a propaganda campaign to discreditCuba, its communist revolution and his younger brother, DefenseMinister Raul Castro.   In Washington, the State Department Deputy spokesman, RichardBoucher, said the Bush administration did not have access to all theevidence in the case and therefore cannot make a judgment about theexecutions.   ``With regard to policy, we, of course, support vigorousprosecution of alleged drug traffickers whoever they may be,'' hesaid.   As for the possibility of U.S. cooperation with Cuba, assuggested by Castro, Boucher said the United States is waiting tosee what Cuba will do ``in terms of efforts to combat drug-relatedactivity that still continues.''   ``You don't automatically start negotiating cooperation until youhave an indication the other side is really serious. And that's whatwe're looking for,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
