Not the drama (certainly not this week). Not the food(check back next month, after New Orleans). It's the shamelessrhetorical excess!   And all of it this week directed at one man. The man with onename. George.   Poor George, that toothache of a man, that hear-nothing,see-nothing, do-nothing vice president. A man, it has now beensaid, ``too squeamish to bait his own hook.''   In a spirit of generosity, the Democrats sometimes give Georgemore than one name. They give him the four he was born with, as inGeorge Herbert Walker Bush ``of the Kennebunkport Bushes.''   Bush is the target of this attention by virtue of the fact thathe is to be nominated next month by the Republicans to standagainst Michael Dukakis, a Democrat about whom not one humorousthing has been said this week at his convention in Atlanta.   Rhetorical excess is political mischief-making with a seriousdesign. A convention provides a four-day televised platform where aparty will lay its record before the public and present its hopesand plans for the future. On the less idealistic side, the TV timecan also be used to instill public doubt in the opposition.   So scorn has been heaped as high as an elephant's eye here inAtlanta as a score of prominent Democrats have taken their bestshot at the man who, it has now been said, probably wears argylesocks with his cowboy boots.   Next month the Republicans get their chance to take on Dukakis,but for now Bush will have to hope his spokeswoman was right whenshe said (in reaction to the notion that George was ``born with asilver foot'' in his mouth): ``I don't think nastiness ever playsvery well.''   Bush emerged from the Wyoming wilderness Wednesday and wasquickly asked about the Democratic criticism. ``It might show alittle desperation,'' he said. ``Why don't they run on what they'refor? Why (should I) respond to a bunch of frantic name-callers?''   The Democrats are poking at Bush's vulnerabilities not so muchwith nastiness as with sarcasm and ridicule.   It began Monday night with the keynote speech, by thesharp-tongued Texas State Treasurer, Ann Richards.   ``For eight straight years George Bush hasn't displayed theslightest interest in anything we care about,'' she said. ``And nowthat he's after a job he can't get appointed to, he's like Columbusdiscovering America. He's found child care. He's found education.''   On Tuesday, Rep. Tony Coelho of California got things started,followed in prime time by Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts andTexas agriculture commissioner Jim Hightower.   ``I know it's not fair to criticize the vice president behindhis back,'' Coelho said, then proceeded to do just that. ``He'sfishing in Wyoming, all alone, except for Jim Baker.'' The treasurysecretary is there, Coelho alleged, ``in case George is toosqueamish to bait his own hook.''   Then Coelho began the ``where was George?'' routine that pokesat Bush's lack of identity in Reagan administration matters.   ``When we sold arms to the Ayatollah,'' he asked, ``Where wasGeorge Bush?   ``When Edwin Meese mocked the values we teach our kids, wherewas Goerge Bush?''   ``... Fact is, for eight years, nobody knows where GeorgeHerbert Hoover Walker Bush has been. He's been silent. Invisible.Missing. AWOL. Gone. Vanished.''   Kennedy made the chant a prime-time highlight.   ``The vice president says he wasn't there, or can't recall, ornever heard as the administration secretly plotted to sell arms toIran. So when the monumental mistake was made, I think it's fair toask, `where was George?'   ``The vice president says he wasn't there, or can't remember, ordidn't comprehend the intelligence report on General Noreiga,'' hesaid. ``...So when that report was being prepared and discussed, Ithink it's fair to ask, `Where was George?'''   And so on, until the crowd began answering for him, and thenrepeated the chant without provocation: ``Where was George?''   For anti-Bush one-liners, you had to like the speech byHightower, a populist who likes to make fun of rich people.   After calling Bush ``a toothache of a man,'' he added, ``His isan upper-class world in which wealth is given to you at birth. Heis a man who was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple.''   All that before the convention was half over. Next month willcome Bush's time for revenge.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Jonathan Wolman is assistant bureau chief forthe AP in Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
