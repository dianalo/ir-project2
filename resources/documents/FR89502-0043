On May 9, 1988, the petitioner, theU.S. Rayon Producers Committee, requested in accordance with andSection;355.10 of the Commerce Regulations an administrative review of the order.We published the initiation on June 29, 1988 (53 FR 24470). The Departmenthas now conducted that administrative review in accordance with section751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Tariff Act'').<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Review</ITAG>The United States, under the auspices of the Customs Cooperation Council,has developed a system of tariff classification based on the internationalharmonized system of Customs nomenclature. On January 1, 1989, the UnitedStates fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) as providedfor in section 1201 et seq. of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Actof 1988. All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumptionon or after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS Item number(s).Imports covered by this review are shipments of Swedish regular viscoserayon staple fiber and high-wet modulus (``modal'') viscose rayon staplefiber. During the review period, such merchandise was classifiable underitem numbers 309.4320 and 309.4325 of the Tariff Schedules of the UnitedStates Annotated. Such merchandise is currently classifiable under HTSitem number 5504.10.0000.The review covers the period January 1, 1987 through December 31, 1987and three programs. The only known Swedish exporter of this merchandiseto the United States is Svenska Rayon, AB.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs</ITAG>(1) Loans/Grants for Plant CreationUnder three agreements, the Swedish government provided Svenska with interest-freeloans for the creation of a modal fiber plant. The agreements providedthat the Swedish government would forgive the loans in equal amounts overten years if Svenska maintained its modal fiber production capacity forten years. If Svenska eliminated this production capacity prior to theend of the ten-year period, the agreements also provided that the remainingamount of the outstanding principal would fall due immediately.The first agreement, Project 77, was concluded in 1975, and the Swedishgovernment disbursed the funds between 1975 and 1977. The second agreement,Project 81, was concluded in 1978 and the funds disbursed between 1978and 1981. In 1979, the Swedish government provided a final interest-freeloan to Svenska for pollution control improvements to the modal fiber plant.Forgiveness of these loans began when the equipment purchased went intooperation. Accordingly, the Swedish government forgave ten percent of thetotal disbursements to Svenska under Project 77 in each year from 1978through 1985. Similarily, the Swedish government forgave ten percent ofthe total disbursements under Project 81 in each year from 1981 through1985 and ten percent of the environmental loan in each year from 1980 through1985. In 1986, after Svenska permanently discontinued all modal fiber productionand closed the modal fiber plant designed and developed for productionof such fiber, the Swedish government forgave Svenska's remaining indebtednessfrom the plant creation and pollution control improvements.Since these loans were in fact grants, we have calculated the benefit streamsusing the declining balance methodology. We allocated the benefits fromeach grant over the 10-year average useful life of assets in the rayonfiber industry, according to the ``Asset Guideline Classes'' of the InternalRevenue Service, and used as discount rates the national average corporatebond rates in Sweden for the years in which each grant was received (obtainedfrom the ``Monthly Digest of Swedish Statistics'', a Swedish governmentpublication).We allocated the benefits attributable to the review period over the valueof Svenska's net sales during the review period. On this basis, we preliminarilydetermine the benefit from this program to be 10.73 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3>(2) Elderly Employment Compensation ProgramThe Swedish government provided a subsidy to certain companies within thetextile and clothing industries through a special employment contributionfor older workers. This program provided compensation to a company basedupon the number of hours worked by employees over 50 years of age. A companyparticipating in the program had to agree not to dismiss or release redundantemployees of any age for any reason other than normal attrition. Paymentswere calculated on the basis of 28 Swedish kronor per hour for employeesover age 50 who were involved in production. The payment could not exceed15 percent of the company's total labor costs.Svenska received its last payment under this program in July 1982. In January1983, the Swedish government excluded the rayon fiber industry, includingSvenska, from this program. Using the declining balance methodology referredto above, we calculated Svenska's benefit by allocating the 1982 paymentover ten years, the average useful life of assets in the rayon fiber industry.We used Svenska's 1982 weighted cost of capital as the discount rate.We allocated the benefit attributable to the review period over the valueof Svenska's net sales during the review period. On this basis, we preliminarilydetermine the benefit from this program to be 0.50 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3>(3) Grant for Manpower Reduction and Conditional LoanThe Swedish government concluded an agreement with Svenska in 1980 consistingof two parts: a grant for manpower reduction and a conditional loan tocover operating losses. The grant was intended to compensate the companyfor maintaining redundant employees longer than collective agreements andemployment protection laws required, and for retraining employees to workelsewhere within the KF Industri group (the group of firms, including Svenska,owned directly or indirectly by Kooperativa Forbundet). The grant was paidthrough the National Labor Market Board in two installments, one in December1980, and the other in July 1981. Svenska received no new manpower productiongrants during the period of review.Using the declining balance methodology, we allocated each grant over tenyears, the average useful life of assets in the rayon fiber industry. Weused as a discount rate the national average corporate bond rate in Swedenfor 1980, the year in which the agreement was reached.We allocated the benefit attributable to the review period over the valueof Svenska's net sales during the review period. On this basis, we preliminarilydetermine the benefit from this grant to be 0.58 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3>For the conditional loan part of the 1980 agreement, the terms (includingthe length) and conditions depended on the company's profit levels. Theconditional loan was disbursed in three installments between 1980 and 1982.Under the original agreement, the Swedish government would forgive portionsof the outstanding principal and interest of the loan if Svenska did notmake a sufficient profit (as determined by a confidential formula concludedbetween the Swedish government and Svenska). If Svenska attained the requisitelevel of profit, it would have to repay a certain portion of the loan,including interest. Svenska did not make a sufficient profit in any yearbetween 1983 and 1985, and the Swedish government forgave the yearly repaymentof the loan in 1983, 1984 and 1985. In 1986, in conjunction with the forgivenessof the loans/grants for plant creation, the Swedish government forgavethe total outstanding balance of this loan.Because Svenska never made any payments on this loan, which was forgivenin its entirety over four years, we have treated each of the three loaninstallments as grants given in the year of receipt. As with the loans/grantsfor plant creation program, we have applied the declining balance methodology,allocating benefits from each grant over the 10-year average useful lifeof assets in the rayon fiber industry. We used as discount rates the nationalaverage corporate bond rates in Sweden for the years in which each grantwas received.We allocated the benefit attributable to the review period over the valueof Svenska's net sales during the review period. On this basis, we preliminarilydetermine the benefit from the conditional loan to be 3.49 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary Results of Review</ITAG>As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine the net subsidy tobe 15.30 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for the period January 1, 1987 through December 31,1987.The Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to assess countervailingduties of 15.30 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments ofthis merchandise exported on or after January 1, 1987 and on or beforeDecember 31, 1987.Further, the Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to collecta cash deposit of estimated countervailing duties, as provided by section751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, of 15.30 percent of the f.o.b. invoice priceon all shipments of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,for consumption on or after the date of publication of the final resultsof this administrative review. This deposit requirement shall remain ineffect until publication of the final results of the next administrativereview.Interested parties may submit written comments on these preliminary resultswithin 30 days of the date of publication of this notice and may requestdisclosure and/or a hearing within 10 days of the date of publication.Any hearing, if requested, will be held 30 days after the date of publicationor the last workday preceding.
