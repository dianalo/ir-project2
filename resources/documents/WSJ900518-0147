In an interview here, the official, who requestedanonymity, disclosed that Colombia sent the Bushadministration a &quot;package of trade, technical and financial&quot;assistance requests more than two months ago and has receivedno reply from the U.S.</LP><TEXT>   The plan, the official said, was sent in the wake of ananti-drug summit in the Colombian coastal city of Cartagenain February that brought together President Bush and theleaders of the three Andean nations, Colombia, Peru andBolivia. At the summit, the U.S. agreed to place moreemphasis on trade and aid to help wean the Andean countriesfrom their economic dependence on cocaine, rather thanprovide mostly a military and police response. But, theofficial said, the U.S. isn't living up to its promise.   &quot;We were very hopeful, especially after Cartagena,&quot; theofficial said. But now, Colombia feels a &quot;negative attitude&quot;from the U.S., he said, adding, &quot;It looks like they're notinterested.&quot; Alluding to recent U.S. decision to start a $35million military aid program in Peru, the official said: &quot;Theresponse of the U.S. is the traditional response to theseproblems -- more military, more U.S. troops, more aircraftcarriers, not practical solutions on the ground.&quot;   In Washington, the White House disputed claims that theadministration hasn't followed through on commitments made inCartagena. &quot;We have been communicating with the Colombiansand doing things for them, so to imply that we haven't beenresponsive is incorrect,&quot; said a White House spokesman.   He said the requests alluded to by the Colombian officialare a &quot;very broadbased list of things, most of which wouldrequire special legislation to give special advantages to theColombians.&quot; The suggestion that these requests, many of themtrade-related, can be accomplished in a matter of months&quot;shows a lack of understanding of the U.S. political system.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
