The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that donors'privacy rights do not override Patty Jo Baker's need to learn theiridentities for her wrongful-death lawsuit.   Although today's action sets no national precedent, the justicestwice in two months have rejected arguments that ``the nationalinterests in a viable volunteer blood system'' are jeopardized byreleasing donors' names in such circumstances.   George W. Baker underwent surgery at Lewisville MemorialHospital in Dallas in 1984, and received several transfusionsduring and after the operation. He died in 1986 of Acquired ImmuneDeficiency Syndrome.   His widow, charging that at least one of the transfused bloodunits was contaminated with the AIDS virus, sued the hosital, theoperating surgeon and two blood banks that supply the hospital.   As part of the pretrial ``discovery'' proceedings, Mrs. Baker'slawyers sought the identities and medical records of all blooddonors whose blood had been used in Baker's health care.   The defendants objected, arguing that complying with therequests would violate donors' privacy rights and that suchinformation was protected under the physician-patient privilege.   A trial judge ruled that the requested information must bereleased, and a state appeals court agreed. The Texas Supreme Courtrefused to hear the case.   The appeal acted on today was filed by one of the sued bloodbanks, known as the Blood Center at Wadley. It is based in Dallas.   Lawyers for the blood bank said courts in Florida and Iowa havebarred the release of blood donors' names in similar cases.   ``The blood banks are a nationwide operation,'' the appeal said.``A blood donor's freedom from intrusive questioning and disclosureof the most intimate details of his life should not depend uponwhich state the donor chooses as his place of residence or wherehis blood is sent.''   The appeal said the Texas courts ``gave too litle weight to theprivacy of donors and the interest of the public in a volunteerblood system.''   The case is Wadley Research Institute and Blood Bank vs.Houston, 87-1438.</TEXT></DOC>
