President Bush is sending Special Trade Representative CarlaHills to a meeting in Paraguay of the Organization of AmericanStates to outline U.S. thoughts on how the region can overcome itsdismal economic performance the past decade.   In an interview Friday, Hills said she plans to stress lowertrade barriers and establishing favorable foreign investmentclimates as two keys to the region's economic recovery.   ``Investment will flow where climate is most hospitable,'' shesaid, adding that a number of countries have begun to scrap policiesthat have crippled growth in the past. ``There have been substantialchanges this year.''   Other officials have cited Mexico, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Venezuelaand Chile as countries which have initiated pro-growth policies.   The 1980s have frequently been described as Latin America's``lost decade'' because of the steep economic decline that occurredin almost all countries in the region.   Hills will be accompanied to the annual OAS conclave of membernation's foreign ministers by Deputy Secretary of State LawrenceEagleburger. They were due to arrive Saturday night in theParaguayan capital of Asuncion.   Eagleburger is standing in for Secretary of State James A. BakerIII, who will be in Europe during the consultations.   Baker's top aide for Latin America, Assistant Secretary of StateBernard Aronson, also is not attending the OAS meeting. He plans togo to Rome for a meeting next week of more than 20 donor countriesfor a discussion on ways to help Nicaragua overcome its economiccrisis.   Hills will meet starting Sunday night with several of the sixhemispheric presidents planning to participate in the discussions,which are taking place on the 100th anniversary of the firstinter-American conference.   Recent OAS meetings have become bogged down over disputes onPanama and the overall Central American question. With those issueslargely resolved, an unusually small number of divisive politicalquestions are on the agenda this year.   Last year OAS delegates spent most of their energies grapplingwith the political crisis in Panama. This year they will be able tofocus more on issues such as drugs, trade, foreign debt and theenvironment, U.S. officials said.   Delegates also will discuss ways of promoting the scheduledtransition to democratic rule in Haiti this year.   Underscoring the relative harmony in the hemisphere these days isthe fact that virtually all 32 OAS members have elected presidents.Paraguay is hosting its first OAS meeting, a recognition of thereplacement of 35 years of military rule last year by an electedgovernment.   Hills will address the meeting at Monday's opening session andvisit Brazil and Argentina afterwards.</TEXT></DOC>
