Bush was only $1.7 million away from the $23 million primaryspending limit as of the beginning of this month, while Dukakisstill had $3.6 million to go before hitting the ceiling, accordingto reports their campaigns filed this week with the FederalElection Commission.   Bush had more cash on hand, $3 million, than Dukakis, who had $2million. While the likely Republican candidate cannot spend thatmuch on campaign activity without exceeding the cap, the law allowsfor additional spending on legal and accounting costs, which arenot included in the $23 million limit.   Jesse Jackson, who has refused to officially concede theDemocratic race to Dukakis despite the Massachusetts governor'snumerical lock on the nomination, has spent only $11 millionagainst the ceiling.   He entered this month with $1.2 million in cash on hand, a solidstart toward a warchest to fund his convention activities. Jacksonhas a full convention team and is planning a significant operationinvolving the platform and rules as well as delegate activity.   Jackson borrowed $1.5 million in May, which brought his receiptsfor the month to more than either Bush or Dukakis. His total was$3.9 million, including $1.5 million in federal matching funds and$893,970 in contributions. Jackson also paid back $1.3 million inloans during the month.   Dukakis raised $3.5 million _ close to $1 million in matchingfunds and $2.3 million in contributions from individuals.   Bush's fund-raising has come to a virtual standstill because hecan't spend much more even if he raised new money. During May hetook in only $45,834 in contributions and received $289,792 infederal matching funds.   Matching funds are provided to presidential candidates who agreeto abide by the spending limits. The taxpayer-supported fund alsofoots the entire general election cost, providing $46 million eachto the Republican and Democratic party nominees.   Bush and Dukakis each have collected enough delegate support towin their parties' nominations at the summer conventions. TheDemocrats meet in Atlanta, July 18-21. The Republicans gather inNew Orleans, Aug. 15-18.   Bush, however, must keep his operation alive with very littlespending between now and the August convention.   He has scaled back his traveling and has switched his strategyto Washington-oriented events and utilization of free news coveragewhich he gets by making himself accessible to the national media.   Bush spent heavily in laying the groundwork at the beginning ofhis campaign last year. Since the start of this year, he has spent$16.2 million, compared to Dukakis' $17.7 million.   Among the candidates who dropped out of the race, the financialstatements show that Senate Minority leader Bob Dole of Kansas andtelevision evangelist Pat Robertson each owe more than $1 millionin campaign debts.   Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., has whittled his down to $111,397 andformer Secretary of State Alexander Haig Jr. owed $352,648 as ofthe end of May, their reports show.  </TEXT></DOC>
