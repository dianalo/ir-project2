In a decision written by Justice Harry Blackmun, the highcourt ruled, 9-0, that federal laws regulating the nuclearindustry don't preclude so-called whistleblowers from suingfor the emotional distress caused by their employers'treatment.</LP><TEXT>   The ruling is a defeat for the nuclear industry, which nowfaces lawsuits under disparate state personal-injury lawsinstead of being held accountable under a single federal law.   The decision reinstates a lawsuit against General ElectricCo. by Vera English, a former employee at the nuclearfuelsplant in Wilmington, N.C. According to GE, the suit asks forabout $1.5 million in compensatory damages and nearly $2.3billion in punitive damages.   Ms. English was fired in 1984 after she complained thatspills of radioactive materials weren't being properlycleaned up by workers. To prove her point, she left aradioactive work area uncleaned and showed her supervisor afew days later that it hadn't been cleaned or even noticed.   After her dismissal, she filed administrative claims underfederal labor law with the Labor Department, but they weredismissed. So she sued the company for emotional distress.   Both a federal district court in North Carolina and afederal appeals court in Richmond, Va., dismissed thelawsuit, ruling that federal law pre-empted her claims.Yesterday, the Supreme Court reversed the appeals courtdecision.   &quot;As a result of the Supreme Court decision the case willgo back to the federal district court in North Carolina,&quot; aGE spokesman said. &quot;GE is confident it will prevail on themerits of the state tort claim, which the Supreme Court saidwas not pre-empted by the federal law.&quot; (English vs. GeneralElectric Co.)                                                                                                          Lawyer Advertising                                                                                                          The justices ruled, 5-4, that states can't prohibitlawyers from truthfully advertising themselves as specialistsin certain areas. The high court ruled that although suchadvertising may be regulated by states to determine whetherit is truthful, it is protected by the First Amendment andcan't be entirely barred.   The high court ruled against Illinois officials for their1989 censure of an Edwardsville, Ill., lawyer. The lawyernoted on his stationery that he is certified as a specialistin civil trials by the National Board of Trial Advocacy, alawyers group that sets standards and maintains lists ofthose who have met them.   Illinois officials censured him because the stateprofessional code for lawyers prohibits claims ofspecialization. Similar bans are contained in the codes ofabout 15 other states.   But in an opinion written by Justice John Stevens, thehigh court ruled that the letterhead is a form of advertisingthat is protected by the First Amendment. Justice Stevens'sopinion only commanded four votes, but Justice ThurgoodMarshall provided a fifth vote, agreeing for separate reasonsthat the Illinois ban was invalid.   Justice Byron White dissented. Justice Sandra O'Connoralso dissented, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist andJustice Antonin Scalia. (Peel vs. Attorney DisciplinaryCommission)                                                                                                          State Bar Dues                                                                                                          The high court ruled, 9-0, that the use of compulsory barassociation dues for lobbying and to support political causesviolates the First Amendment rights of lawyers who object tothe positions advocated.   The decision, written by Chief Justice Rehnquist, was adefeat for the State Bar of California. But it will affectother states as well. In recent years, some 30 states havehad mandatory bar associations, those that lawyers arerequired to join. Many of these bar associations use aportion of their compulsory dues to become involved in localpolitical issues.   In California, the state bar used dues to lobby forlegislation, file friend-of-the-court briefs, and adoptresolutions supporting gun control and a nuclear freeze. In achallenge by 21 lawyers, the California Supreme Court upheldthe bar's activities.   Yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed that ruling.The court said that a state bar may spend dues to lobby onissues directly related to the profession, such aslegislation on lawyers' ethics, but not for other, unrelatedmatters.   The decision subjects bar associations to the same limitson dues that the court has imposed on labor unions, althoughthe American Bar Association had urged the high court togrant more flexibility. (Keller vs. State Bar of California)                                                                                                          Natural Gas Pricing                                                                                                          The justices agreed to decide whether Congress gave theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission the authority to revampthe pricing for natural gas from wells that were inproduction before November 1978. A federal appeals court inNew Orleans ruled in September 1989 that the commissionexceeded its authority in 1986 when it revamped the pricingsystem for so-called old natural gas.   If the justices uphold the appeals court ruling, thecommission may order producers to refund $100 million toconsumers, industry groups say.   Old gas is gas produced from wells that were already inoperation when the federal Natural Gas Policy Act took effectin November 1978. Congress set higher price ceilings forso-called new gas, gas that would come from newer wells, andlower ceilings for old gas. But the 1978 federal law alsopreserved 15 different categories of old gas with varyingprice ceilings, based on the age of the wells.   In 1986, the FERC concluded that the ceilings for old gaswere so low that producers were abandoning old wells, leavinghuge untapped reserves and prompting greater reliance onimports and on higher-priced new wells. The commissionconsolidated old gas into one category, raised the price, andrequired producers to renegotiate their contracts.   Pipeline companies, consumers and distributors challengedFERC's authority for the orders and won in appeals court.   The case was appealed to the high court by the commissionand by two dozen natural gas producers. They said the appealscourt ruling will disrupt natural gas markets and 1,600natural gas supply contracts that have been renegotiated.(Mobil Oil Exploration and Producing Southeast Inc. vs.United Distribution Cos.; FERC vs. United Distribution Cos.)                                                                                                          Airline Lawsuits                                                                                                          The high court agreed to decide whether a treaty thatgoverns liability for international airline flights allowspassengers to sue for damages for emotional distress becauseof near mishaps, even though there were no physical injuries.The justices agreed to hear an appeal by Texas Air Corp.'sEastern Airlines Inc. unit.   The case stems from 25 separate lawsuits filed against theairline under Florida and federal laws by passengers who wereon an Eastern flight in 1983 from Miami to the Bahamas. Soonafter takeoff the engines shut down, and passengers were toldthe plane would have to ditch in the Atlantic Ocean. Thepilots were able to restart one engine and return to Miami,but not before the plane sharply lost altitude.   Most international flights are subject to a treaty,approved by the U.S. in 1934 and modified in 1966, thatlimits airline liability for accidents to property andindividuals.   Last year, a federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled thatthe treaty allows lawsuits for emotional distress, even whenthere was no physical injury. A federal district court haddismissed the lawsuits before trial.

Thehigh court refused to hear appeals by General Motors Corp.and Reynolds Metals Co. General Motors challenged the $6.3million that it and several subsidiaries paid from 1983through 1988. Reynolds objected to $1.2 million it paid in1982 and 1983.   The companies argued that the franchise tax, imposed onall corporations doing business in Alabama, is calculateddifferently for companies based in Alabama than for thosebased in other states. The result, they argued, is a muchheavier tax on out-of-state corporations than on those basedin Alabama. But the Alabama Supreme Court concluded that thetax doesn't violate either the 14th Amendment guarantee of&quot;equal protection of the laws&quot; or the Constitution'sprohibition on interference with interstate commerce.(General Motors Corp. vs. Department of Revenue; ReynoldsMetals Co. vs. Sizemore)</TEXT></DOC>
