But progress does not stop: beyond the existing commercial reactors, new projects are being developed.Advanced versions of the present families of plants will allow for betteroperability, reliability, and competitivity while still improving upontheir high level of safety. Further on, fast breeders will allow to extractmany times more energy from the uranium ressources. The whole nuclearindustry, from the power plants to the fuel cycle facilities, will, fora long time to come, keep being a driving force towards excellence inmaterials research and development.</TEXT></DOC>
