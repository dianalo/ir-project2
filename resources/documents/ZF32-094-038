(N.E.T.), has announced major newproducts and coordinated development and testing efforts with IBM, in aneffort to further integrate local- and wide-area communications.andP;  The newinternetworking announcements are the latest results of the strategicdevelopment and distribution agreement between IBM and N.E.T.andM;The announcements include:andM;-    The N.E.T.andP;  LAN/WAN Exchange, a product to integrateandM;multivendor LAN internetworking communications withandM;voice, video, data, image, and facsimileandM;communications; the new product will be distributedandM;worldwide by IBM and N.E.T.andM;-    License of IBM's Token-Ring technology to N.E.T.andM;-    Coordinated frame relay product development and jointandM;participation in the Frame Relay ForumandM;-    Joint N.E.T.andP;  and IBM product testing, providingandM;interoperability between the companies' implementationsandM;of frame relay and IBM Token-Ring technologiesandM;The LAN/WAN Exchange is the first product based on the packet- circuitarchitecture of N.E.T.'s IDNX product family.andP;  Downloaded into the engine ofan IDNX system, the LAN/WAN Exchange product consolidates packet-mode LANinformation--as well as voice, video, image, and facsimilecommunications--into a single enterprise transport.andM;The product can integrate LAN internetworking communications withcircuit-mode communications, such as voice or video.andP;  The integrated LAN/WANExchange and IDNX product can dynamically route voice, video, image, and LANcommunications based on user- assigned priorities.andM;The N.E.T.andP;  LAN/WAN Exchange starts at $7,995 and will be available worldwidebeginning in August 1991.andM;IBM has licensed its Token Ring Network Bridge Program technology--includingIBM LAN Network Manager agents--to N.E.T.andP;  for use in future versions of theLAN/WAN Exchange and in other internetworking products.andM;Using IBM's LAN Network Manager agent technology, the token-ring capabilitiesof the LAN/WAN Exchange product will be managed by the IBM LAN NetworkManager.andP;  In addition, the LAN/WAN Exchange will be able to consolidatenetwork management information from workstations on a token-ring network andforward the information to an IBM LAN Network Manager console.andM;Complementing the LAN/WAN Exchange product is a new N.E.T.andP;  frame relayproduct that will leverage the IDNX packet-circuit architecture.andP;  The N.E.T.andO;frame relay product will provide a method for organizations to connect theirremote computing devices to an IDNX network using the CCITT and ANSI framerelay standard.andP;  The product is scheduled for availability in mid-1992.andM;Together, N.E.T.andP;  and IBM have joined the Frame Relay Forum, working withother vendors employing frame relay technology to provide further multivendorproduct compatibility.andM;Information:  Drusie Demopoulos, N.E.T., (415) 780-5313.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
