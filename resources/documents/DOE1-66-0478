<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-66-0478 </DOCNO><TEXT>Investigations are made with respect to already existing dual purposeplants (power plant + thermal seawater desalination) to find an alternativeto significantly increase drinking water production at the same primaryenergy input rate. One possibility to achieve this goal is the reverseosmosis process. Therefore tests on a seawater pilot plant in Kuwait(GKSS plate system, type G4) had been carried out to determine the specificenergy input up to the maximum possible recovery with respect to scalingat a given pretreatment. The limiting recovery was determined to about62% and the detected scaling was mainly aluminium silicates. With 24figs., 12 tabs..</TEXT></DOC>
