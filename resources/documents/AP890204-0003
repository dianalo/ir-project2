The first lady, in an interview Friday, also expressed ``enormoussympathy'' for the financial plight of members of Congress, who aretaking political heat for a 51 percent pay increase.   ``I know it sounds outrageous to people at home, but if they sawthe cost of Washington housing ... . It's terrible. And thesacrifices the family makes,'' Mrs. Bush said.   She said her family had not been able to live off her husband'ssalary in the 1960s when he was a member of the House from Houston,but had to rely on the money he had earned as an oilman. She saidthey probably could have made it on his congressional salary if theyhadn't owned two homes and hadn't wanted to send their children toprivate schools.   Mrs. Bush said she did not want to discuss the ``politics andpolicies'' surrounding handgun ownership. Her husband, PresidentBush, opposes new federal handgun controls and is a lifetime memberof the NRA. The NRA is the most powerful lobby against lawsregulating firearms.   ``I myself do not own a gun,'' she said. ``I choose not to getinto that. I'm afraid of guns. ... I'm so afraid I'd shoot the wrongperson.''   Nancy Reagan, before moving to Washington eight years ago,revealed she had owned ``a tiny little gun'' that she kept by herbed for protection while her husband was away. In her first WhiteHouse interview in 1981, Mrs. Reagan said she had gotten rid of theweapon.   Marking the end of her second week in the White House, Mrs. Bushspent part of Friday afternoon giving her first interviews since herhusband became president. ``I feel at home here,'' she said, sittingon a couch, bathed in light from an arched window behind her.   Asked if her husband had changed in any way since becomingpresident, she replied, ``I don't see a difference with him.''Pointing to several people in the room, she said, ``I see adifference in you and you and you. Not me. I mean it's justdifferent when you're president. Everybody treats you differentlywhen you're president.''   Joking about her husband's former status as vice president, Mrs.Bush said, ``I spend half my life saying, `Could you please get thevice president on the phone?' and the operator says, `Do you reallywant Dan Quayle' or `Don't you know Dan Quayle's in Venezuela.'''   More seriously, she said, one big difference for Bush is that``everything you say becomes major, and it is major. He is thepresident of the United States.''   And yet, she said of her husband: ``I think he's exactly thesame.'' She said many people who used to kid with her husband hadstopped doing that briefly but ``after awhile they all became normalagain. It just took a little while. ...   ``I call him Mr. President sometimes _ when I'm needling him ...to tease him, `Yes, Mr. President.'''   The first lady was asked whether she favored enactment of lawsbanning sale to the public of military assault guns. Measures tooutlaw the manufacture, sale or possession of a variety of riflesare pending in Congress and dozens of states. It was a Chinese AK-47assault rifle that a gunman used in the rampage in which fivechildren were killed and 29 others, were wounded in Stockton, Calif.last month.   Mrs. Bush said she thought such weapons already were outlawed.``They should be, absolutely,'' she said.   While refusing to discuss her position on handguns, Mrs. Bushsaid that she does not like to go hunting, as does her husband, anavid outdoorsman.   ``I went hunting with George once,'' Mrs. Bush recalled. ``Hetold me to follow the bird, and I followed the bird and his headcame right through that little circle (the rifle scope). I put downthe gun and said, `That's it. I'm not going to do that again.'''</TEXT></DOC>
