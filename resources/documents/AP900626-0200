Atlanta in the 1990s is emerging as the new center for rhythmand blues, just as Detroit did in the '60s with Motown.   Recording artists are flocking to the South's capital from NewYork and Los Angeles, drawn by a cheaper real estate market andmore privacy.   ``Atlanta was one of the country's best-kept secrets,'' said TomWright, owner of Cheshire Sound Studios, where singers such asPeabo Bryson and Bobby Brown come to record. ``Not anymore.''   Bryson was new in the music business and Atlanta seemed like agood place to start. So when the relatively unknown Bang recordsoffered him a contract, he snapped it up. Nineteen years later,he's still here, after raising a family and building a prosperouscareer.   ``Atlanta was not a throbbing metropolis full of opportunity inthe recording industry, but it was also not a New York City _ allcrowded,'' Bryson said in an interview.   ``I wanted to develop my writing style here, learn to makerecordings. Now the producers are here, the equipment is here. I'mglad I stayed.''   Bryson was joined last year by Brown, the former New Editionmember whose multiplatinum album, ``Don't Be Cruel,'' sold 5million copies.   Brown bought a downtown building, which he is calling Bosstown,to convert to a recording and pre-production studio.   Arista producers Antonio ``LA'' Reid and Kenny ``Babyface''Edmonds, responsible for No. 1 hits by Brown, Reid's wife, Pebbles,and Paula Abdul, opened their own label, LaFace Records. They havean office in suburban Norcross and plan a nearby studio to handleat least eight projects a year _ including Whitney Houston's newalbum.   ``It's a place we felt we could raise a family and live normallives,'' Edmonds said.   Producer Dean ``Sir'' Gant of Platinum Plus Productions, who hasworked with Anita Baker, George Howard and Madonna, also has openedshop in Atlanta. Others who've been lured here include the vocalgroup After 7, and Matt ``Atlanta'' Bliss, trumpeter for Prince.   ``Unless you're somebody everybody really knows like BobbyBrown, you're safe here,'' Bliss said. ``People here aren't used tolooking for stars on the street. In L.A., yeah, that's all it is.''   Bryson is a visible celebrity in Atlanta. He's frequentlyspotted walking around town and says he enjoys the city's mostpopular and crowded nightclubs _ Petrus and Ruperts. He's also anavid patron of the region's first comedy club catering to blackacts, the Comedy Act Theatre.   ``Although anonymity is not readily afforded, here people arevery calm,'' he said. ``They'll walk up to you but they don'tnecessarily have to bother you. You won't get your clothes torn offhere. It has a lot to do with Southern hospitality. Our attitude isbasically different.''   Georgia isn't new to the music scene. The industry has beenbuilding since James Brown formed his band in Toccoa about 30 yearsago. Progressive rockers REM, the Georgia Satellites and the IndigoGirls all started here.   But the newcomers are primarily Randamp;B artists and their producers.With the producers comes Atlanta's chance at becoming a majorrecording market, just as Detroit once was, and other cities aswell: Memphis, in the '60s with Stax Records; Muscle Shoals in the'60s with Aretha Franklin; Chicago in the '60s with Curtis Mayfieldand Jerry Butler; Philadelphia in the '70s with the O'Jays andSpinners; and Minneapolis in the '80s with Prince and Jimmy JamProductions.   Bryson said the producers' presence means it's no longernecessary for artists to fly to New York and Los Angeles forrecording sessions. Production costs are relatively equal in everycity, he added, and the latest technology has come to Atlanta'sstudios.   ``There's a producers' network now ... unheralded and unspoken,but it's here,'' Bryson said. ``And Cheshire studio is the place tobe. We hang out, exchange ideas.   ``Atlanta is a very sophisticated place. People can afford tolive here on an opulent level. New York and L.A. _ these areglorious places where opulence is the order of the day, but they'renot afforded by a whole lot of people.''   Real estate costs that are significantly lower than New York orLos Angeles have prompted many artists to move here.   ``You can get 1,200 square feet, if you're lucky, for a quarterof a million (dollars) there,'' Bryson said. ``And here, if you'rewilling to drive just 20 minutes, you can get five bedrooms with acircular drive on an acre of land. That's pretty decent.''   Rent also is often prohibitive for musicians living in New York.Former Cameo singer Charlie Singleton, now a solo artist, said,``About $700 here will get you a nice place. That's worth $1,200 orso there.''   Gant, working on his third album with Bryson, moved toAlpharetta to raise his three children, save money and to gain someprivacy.   ``You'd be out for lunch and the waiter finds out you're aproducer and pops out the demo tape. You don't find that here,'' hesaid.   ``With all the recording here _ and there's a lot of it going on_ this will be one of the biggest recording places in the world,''said Bobby Byrd, who played with James Brown for 25 years afterhelping the singer start his band in his grandmother's basement inToccoa. ``I think two years and we'll be big on the map.''   Byrd just opened his own studio and production facilities _called Phase One and Byrd's Nest Productions _ to work with JacksonRecords.   Bliss, who moved to Marietta from Minneapolis, said Atlanta willdefine the '90s as a decade of musical variety _ from a mellowBryson to the more pop sounds of Singleton.   The influx of artists has meant big business to the city'srecording studios. Cheshire studios were booked solid last year,with 1989 the best of Wright's 20 years recording.   Talent scouts are taking note, too. The owners of twonightclubs, The Point and The Cotton Club, signed a three-yearcontract with Warner-Chappell, the world's largest musicpublishers, to scout the area.   Bobby Brown's ``Live at Sensations'' talent showcase regularlyattracted scouts from Atlantic, Warner Bros., CBS and Arista, untilthe club lost its lease this month, said Sensations manager EdRucker.   While Brown seldom attended the showcase, other stars oftenjoined the amateurs for impromptu concerts.   ``Jermaine Jackson and Peabo Bryson were performing one week andStevie Wonder walked in,'' Rucker said. ``He upstaged everybody,just walked on to the stage.''   Industry insider Bob Patton, former booking manager for JamesBrown, said while Atlanta probably won't become the musical ``NewYork of the South,'' it can easily surpass Detroit's claim as thecountry's soul capital.   Experts said it's too early to guess just what share of the $6.5billion recording industry Atlanta has snared. But Bryson saidwithin three years, 25 percent of the recording will come fromAtlanta.   ``You can make a great recording anywhere,'' agreed23-year-resident Rodney Mills, former producer for .38 Special nowworking with Singleton. ``But there's something of an advantagewhen enough people in the same business are in the same city.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv</NOTE></DOC>
