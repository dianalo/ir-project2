The apparently doomed institutions represent about 10% ofthe nation's savings banks, and include about 15 of thebiggest savings banks. Regulators are already negotiatingwith bidders for Goldome of Buffalo, N.Y., which had anegative net worth of $452.4 million at year end, althoughGoldome hasn't yet been seized by the FDIC.</LP><TEXT>   Four other large savings banks have also run out ofcapital, and at least 10 others have such big continuinglosses or such heavy burdens of nonperforming assets thatthey are unlikely to survive for long without a miraculousrecovery in Northeast real estate markets. These 15institutions had assets of about $45 billion at year end. TheFDIC's historical cost for resolving insolvencies rangesroughly from 10% to 20% of assets, or in this case, fromabout $4.5 billion to $9 billion if all 15 were to fail.Still, the FDIC doesn't expect the troubled Northeast banksto fail all at once, or within any specific time frame.   The FDIC says it has established reserves for the expectedcosts of savings bank failures. At the end of 1990, theFDIC's reserves stood at $8.3 billion. During 1991, the FDICestimates, 180 savings and commercial banks will fail,drawing the fund down to $4.1 billion. Those predictionsassume the recession ends by the middle of this year.   &quot;Some {savings} institutions likely won't make it andwe'll have to handle them,&quot; said a senior FDIC officialspeaking on condition of anonymity. So far this year, onlytwo savings banks have been seized, compared with 10 failureslast year and one in 1989.   Moreover, most of the remaining 90% of the industry iswell-capitalized and benefits from low-cost deposits. GreenPoint Savings Bank, New York, has a lot of nonperformingassets, but a capital ratio equal to 12% of assets and itearned $91.2 million last year before extraordinary items.Even some big losers can withstand losses for several moreyears. For instance, People's Bank, Bridgeport, Conn., lost$84.7 million before extraordinary items last year and isinundated with more than a half billion dollars of badassets. But with $375 million of capital, it can last anotherfour years at its 1990 loss rate.   But much of the industry is deteriorating so fast thatsome investment bankers doubt that the FDIC's reserves aresufficient. &quot;They will probably say the cost of Goldome willbe $500 million, but I'm sure it's north of $1 billion,&quot;asserts an investment banker familiar with the negotiations.He notes that some sick banks haven't had a full regulatoryexamination for as long as two years, and that the growth ofnonperforming assets is far outstripping increases inreserves against those assets.   The industry lost a record $2.4 billion, more than threetimes the $773 million it lost in 1989 and also far in excessof the $1.4 billion savings banks lost in 1981, the previousworst year on record, according to an FDIC research report.   The biggest loser was Howard Savings Bank, of Newark,N.J., with a loss of $161.3 million before extraordinaryitems, followed by Meritor Savings Bank, Philadelphia, andAmerican Savings Bank, White Plains, N.Y. The nonperformingassets of each of these banks dwarfed remaining capital andreserves.   If savings banks &quot;don't have adequate reserves to covertheir losses, equity will be eroded and eventually they willbe insolvent,&quot; observes Donald Inscoe, an FDIC senior bankinganalyst, who declined to discuss specific institutions. Threeof the top 12 money losers are already insolvent: FirstMutual Bank for Savings, Boston; Dartmouth Bank, Manchester,N.H.; and Amoskeag Bank, also in Manchester.   Although analysts consider most of these biggest moneylosers doomed to federal takeover, several aren't concedingtheir demise. Meritor and First Mutual Bank are seekingprivate capital infusions, but given their losses such aid isunlikely. Amoskeag and Central Bank, Meriden, Conn., areseeking capital contributions and/or a loan from the FDIC.&quot;If we don't get assistance, we will become insolvent thisyear,&quot; said Richard Reilly, controller of Central Bank, aunit of Cenzest Inc.   Judging from past experience, these applications face longodds. The FDIC needs to see a likelihood of recovery, andapproved only one of several dozen such applications filedlast year. However, an FDIC official said, &quot;We areopen-minded and willing to listen to any proposal.&quot;   In the first quarter, losses generally eased because offewer write-downs of bad loans, but were still enough toeventually wipe out the most troubled institutions.</TEXT></DOC>
