Reuss said.   Mr. Reuss added that GM sees a slow recovery, with U.S.car and light-truck sales next year rising only to 13.5million to 14 million vehicles. &quot;I don't see a double-dip{recession},&quot; Mr. Reuss said. &quot;The challenge is the rate atwhich we're moving out of it.&quot; Consumer confidence remainssoft, he said, and some potential car buyers are delayingpurchases because they're worried about their jobs.</LP><TEXT>   Still, Mr. Reuss said GM's U.S. vehicle production in theremainder of the year will improve over year-ago levelsbecause &quot;we haven't had stocks {of unsold cars} so low since1971, when we had a strike.&quot; In the 1990 fourth quarter, GMbuilt only about 874,000 cars and trucks in the U.S. as theeconomy slumped toward recession.   Speaking at a new-model introduction show for GMemployees, Mr. Reuss also predicted GM will gain onepercentage point of market share during the next year, mainlybecause of new Oldsmobile and Pontiac models now beinglaunched.
