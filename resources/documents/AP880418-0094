RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today left intact a keyfederal regulation designed to foster competition within thenatural gas industry.   The justices, without comment, rejected appeals by pipelinecompanies that claim the rule places them in an unfair economicbind.   The justices also refused to hear arguments by natural gasproducers who support giving federal officials broader power toregulate the pipelines.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission adopted sweeping newregulations in 1985 to change the way the natural gas industryoperates.   The key change _ called the open-access rule _ is aimed atgiving consumers the benefits of competition among natural gassuppliers.   The rule requires pipeline companies, under certain conditions,to transport gas sold by other producers and traders. Thus, thepipeline companies would carry gas that is in competition withtheir own supplies.   The commission adopted the rule to end what it said was apractice that unnecessarily inflates the price of some gas supplies.   Potentially billions of dollars in proceeds from gas sales areat stake in the dispute.   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here substantially upheld thecommission's new regulations last year, stating that the pipelinecompanies apparently were trying to stifle competition.   ``Their attack on the (commission rule) is precisely that it maydisable them from passing on to customers gas purchase costs thatthey incur under contracts entered into years ago under premisesnow obsolete,'' the appeals court said. ``In other words,enforcement (of the rule) will expose them to competition thattheir discriminatory practices enable them to avoid.''   The commission said the pipelines had been practicing unfairdiscrimination by generally declining to transport gas incompetition with their own sales, thus denying consumers access togas at the lowest reasonable rates.   The commission said the problem was aggravated by the phasingout of price controls in recent years.   In the appeal acted on today, the pipeline companies said theopen-access rule is causing a dramatic decline in gas sales and adrop in drilling for gas reserves. The regulation ``has raisedquestions as to the security of the nation's gas supply and hasthreatened the financial and operational base of the pipelineindustry,'' the companies said.   The appeals court here stopped short of upholding all of thecommission's 1985 regulations.   The appeals court ordered the commission to come up with anadequate explanation of its decision not to amend so-calledtake-or-pay provisions in gas supply contracts.   A take-or-pay provision requires a pipeline to pay a producerfor some specified percentage of deliverable gas, for example 75percent, even if the pipeline took less.   The pipeline companies say such provisions became particularlyonerous by committing them to high gas costs in what by 1982 becamea time of falling prices.   Natural gas producers urged the justices to overturn thatportion of the appeals court ruling that requires the commission tore-examine its support of the take-or-pay concept.   The cases are Interstate Natural Gas Association vs. FERC,87-976; Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. vs. FERC, 87-977; ShellOffshore Inc. vs. Associated Gas Distributors, 87-978; Willcox,Ariz., vs. FERC, 87-979; and Southern California Gas Co. vs. FERC,87-1091.</TEXT></DOC>
