On potential entry is via propagationof local faults. Within this category is a wide range of initiators whicheach require assessment of their probability and consequences in orderto determine their contribution to plant risk. Local faults include thoseinitiators which cause local power/flow disturbances restricted eitherto a single subassembly or to a local region of the bundle. The concernis that these localized initiators may start a sequence of events inwhich fuel failure may propagate first within a subassembly envelopeand finally cause loss of coolable geometry in adjacent. This documentdiscusses these scenarios. 3 refs., 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
