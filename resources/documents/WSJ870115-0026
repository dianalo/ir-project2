In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Shamrock, a Burbank, Calif.-based investment firm, said it sent a letter to Holly Sugar asking for access to information it believes is necessary to determine whether it should make a competing proposal.    Shamrock, which holds 5.5% of Holly's common, had said last June that it might join another investment group, which holds a 10% stake, in a possible bid. But since then, that group, which includes New York-based Brookehill Equities Inc. and Moran, Moore, Grossman andamp; deRose Inc., has said it plans to launch a proxy fight for control of Colorado Springs, Colo.-based Holly.    Holly and Shamrock officials couldn't be reached for comment.    As previously reported, Holly received a leveraged-buyout proposal in December from Arcanum I Partners and certain members of senior management, including Michael Buschbaum, Holly's chairman. Holly said terms of the proposal called for shareholders to receive $35 and one share of a new class of preferred stock for each of the 1.1 million common shares outstanding. Mr. Buschbaum has been trying with other members of Holly management to take the company private since at least March 1982, but hasn't been able to obtain financing.    Holly shares closed yesterday at $103.50, up $1.50, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
