He says the Soviet strategic objectives victory, superiority,and offensive action, are goals to be striven for, not conditions tobe guaranteed. American objectives are deterrence, sufficiency, and retaliation.Soviet strategy sees war as essentially unpredictable while Americanstrategy demands certainty.
