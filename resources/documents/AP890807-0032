The dollar closed at 139.78 yen, up 1.73 yen from last Friday'sclosing of 138.05 yen. It opened the week's trading at 139.55 yenand ranged between 139.10 and 139.80 yen.   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 111.61points, or 0.32 percent, to end trading at 34,630.38. The indexdeclined 37.82 points on Friday.   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's jump to its upswing inNew York last Friday following an unexpected drop in the U.S.jobless rate for July.   ``There was some active buying of the dollar by players who arerelieved of the anxiety that the Fed will relax its interest ratesfurther,'' said a dealer at a major commercial bank, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   Washington last Friday announced the nation's unemployment ratefor July was 5.2 percent, down 0.1 percentage point from an earliermonth, reassuring market players that the U.S. economy was stillgrowing moderately.   But the dollar is unlikely to keep rising ``because marketplayers tend to sell the U.S. currency for profit-taking wheneverit approaches the 140-yen mark,'' said a dealer at the Bank ofJapan, requesting anonymity.   Securities dealers said the yen's weakness and politicaluncertainties are depressing stock prices.   ``Until the new government under a fresh prime minister getsgoing, I don't expect a summer rally,'' said a dealer at NikkoSecurities Co., speaking anonymously.   The governing Liberal Democratic Party is expected to chose anew leader who will replace Prime Minister Sousuke Uno as Japan'sprime minister.</TEXT></DOC>
