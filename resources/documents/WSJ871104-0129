But don't bother looking for the spot on TV.    Neither will you find Woody Allen plugging a department-store chain, Sylvester Stallone hawking beer, or Paul Newman pushing Nissan cars. Unless, that is, you're in Japan.    American celebrities who turn up their noses in disgust at doing TV commercials in the States are happily hawking everything from liquor to life insurance in the Orient. Not only is the money good, but their fans in the U.S. won't see them -- freeing them from such potential annoyances as overexposure, humiliation and the appearance of unchecked greed.    &quot;I'm not aware of any celebrity who won't do a commercial in Japan,&quot; says Sandra Joseph, an agent with Joseph, Heldfond andamp; Rix, a Los Angeles talent agency that handles many TV-commercial actors.    Actress Diane Lane, for example, models Max Factor of Japan cosmetics and has endorsed a Japanese diamond firm and a liquor company. &quot;If Woody Allen can do it,&quot; she figures, &quot;then there is no such thing as selling out.&quot;    Money is the main attraction. Although Japanese commercials don't pay as well as the American kind, what run-of-the-mill celebrity can pass up an easy $50,000 to $100,000? Bigger stars can earn more than $500,000, while the biggest can command more than $1 million for an ad campaign, agents say. And while that doesn't compare with, say, Michael Jackson's $10 million endorsement deal in the U.S. with PepsiCo Inc., &quot;it's a lot of money for two days' work,&quot; says Curry Walls, the president of Ingels Inc., a Los Angeles firm that lines up celebrities for advertisers and for other celebrity-seekers.    It is hard to find a star too big or too rich to grab for a little more dough. Mr. Stallone, who is said to make $16 million for a movie, is shown in a Kirin beer ad striding Rambo-like through water, his muscles rippling. Paul Newman chit-chats (in English) with a little girl in his latest commercial for a Japanese credit card. Mikhail Baryshnikov, Sean Connery, John Travolta and Nastassia Kinski have made pitches recently, too, according to the Japanese ad agency Dentsu Inc.    Athletes and musicians also flock to the Japanese to pick up a little pin money. Most of the world's top tennis players have made commercials, including John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors and Martina Navratilova, Dentsu says. Rock star-actor Sting received seven figures to endorse Kirin beer, according to an ad-agency executive; in a magazine ad he stands bare-chested, a can of beer in one hand and a bass fiddle in the other.    Sting couldn't be reached for comment. Neither, for that matter, could almost anyone else. Madonna's publicist curtly dismisses an inquiry with &quot;this isn't something that she wants to comment about.&quot; Brooke Shields, who endorsed Sansui stereos, doesn't respond to two inquiries. Woody Allen's representatives refuse to contact him, saying he made his commercial several years ago. &quot;I'm not going to give you any information,&quot; snaps Sylvester Stallone's lawyer, Jacob Bloom, before hanging up.    Away from the prying eyes of the public, however, the stars can't get enough Japanese deals. The number of Americans in Japanese commercials has soared since the first few appeared more than a decade ago. Japanese ad agency officials say they are bombarded by requests from U.S. stars and near-stars. &quot;Even the celebrities I don't represent are always talking about Japan,&quot; says Ms. Joseph, the agent. &quot;It's a prestige thing to do.&quot;    The Americans are beneficiaries of twin Japanese infatuations: with all things foreign and with all celebrities. Motoko Yamamoto, a schoolteacher in Yokasuka who says she loves Paul Newman, is surprised when told that American TV commercials don't use foreign celebrities. &quot;No?&quot; she asks, baffled. &quot;Why not?&quot;    Although the Japanese usually clamor for the same stars who are popular here, their taste occasionally strays. Singer Irene Cara, who recorded the song &quot;Fame,&quot; hasn't been highly visible lately in the U.S. but remains popular in Japan, where she has pitched coffee. A recent survey by Video Research Ltd. in Tokyo found that the most popular female foreigner among Japanese adults is Audrey Hepburn.    Jazz musician Herbie Hancock, who pitched Suntory whiskey in Japan, says his popularity &quot;in ways is bigger over there, because jazz is more prestigious.&quot; Although he doesn't generally do commercials in the U.S., he says, &quot;I'm putting my feelers out&quot; for more work in Japan.    Ms. Lane -- whose five-year Max Factor contract pays &quot;in the millions,&quot; according to her father -- is also better known in Japan. &quot;I get off the plane and there are TV crews and crying fans with roses,&quot; she says. &quot;The films that made me famous over there were films that were quite the opposite in the U.S. 'A Little Romance' they loved -- those really sensitive-type stories that just don't tend to sell well over here.&quot;    Conspicuously absent from Japanese ads are major American TV stars, whose shows aren't as popular in Japan as are U.S. movies. How popular is &quot;Dynasty&quot; vixen Joan Collins? A puzzled Sueo Kubota, the president of the U.S. unit of Tokyo's Kirin Brewery Co., pauses before replying, &quot;I'm not so familiar with TV stars in the U.S.&quot;    Celebrities rationalize about why it is all right to do commercials in Japan although the very thought of doing them here is abhorrent. They note that they don't have to talk about a product, use it or even show it. &quot;Their mere presence is enough to endorse the product,&quot; says Bernard Barber, an executive vice president of Tokyo-based ad agency McCann-Erickson Hakuhodo Inc.    The ads are also less crassly commercial than those here. &quot;Most Japanese people enjoy watching commercials,&quot; says Mrs. Yamamoto, the teacher. &quot;They're very artistic and nice just to watch.&quot;    Making the ads even more attractive for the stars, Japanese crews will travel here to film them. Mr. Hancock was filmed in his own home in Los Angeles by a crew of about two dozen -- including custom tailors flown over to make him just the right suits.    But despite all the rationalizing, most celebrities would rather appear on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; than let U.S. fans see their Japanese work. They routinely write clauses into their contracts forbidding publicity about the ads, and some contracts demand enormous payments if the commercials are shown in the U.S. Farrah Fawcett, who had such a contract, received a settlement about five years ago after a diamond commercial she did in Japan appeared in a segment of a U.S. news show, says her agent, Marjorie Schicktanz.    Other actors enforce their contracts with equal vigor. Initially, Kirin's Mr. Kubota is very happy to talk at length about the latest campaign starring Sting, and he promptly sends a reporter a videotape of the commercial. &quot;Sting was very hard&quot; to sign up, he explains. &quot;Sting is very famous in Japan. I think we paid him like $1 million. Very, very big money.&quot;    But when the reporter arrives for work the next morning, Mr. Kubota has been patiently waiting for more than an hour, a decorous senior executive sitting politely amid messengers and maintenance men. He follows the reporter to her desk and seizes the unviewed tape, explaining that he has learned that Sting's contract forbids showing it in the U.S. Then he bows, disappears into the elevator and is gone. </TEXT></DOC>
