Allowing such a deduction is one of numerous ideas thattop Bush administration officials are considering for apackage that aims to repair the private health-care market.No final decisions have been made, and President Bush hasn'teven seen some of the options that health and economic policyaides are preparing, administration officials say. But as thehealth-care debate escalates in the presidential campaign,the White House has focused more attention on the issue.</LP><TEXT>   It has been clear for some time that the proposal isalmost certain to include tax credits to help low-incomepeople buy insurance, say people familiar with thedeliberations in and out of the administration. But thepossibility of tax breaks to the middle class hasn't beenpreviously reported.   Both the size of the credits and the income level of thoseentitled to them haven't been decided. Officials areconsidering credits of a few hundred dollars for the workingpoor and are discussing credits ranging from about $1,000 to$3,000 for the poorest families.   If the president decides to go for big credits andsweetened deductions for the middle class, people withknowledge of the negotiations say the administration will payfor it by extracting large savings from projected spending onthe government's two major health programs: Medicare, whichprovides health insurance to the elderly and disabled, andMedicaid, which is jointly run with the states and provideshealth care for the poor. Administration officials vehementlystress that they wouldn't pare a penny of benefits, butadvocates for the elderly always argue that any cuts hurt theprogram.   The options are also being reviewed by White Housepolitical aides, setting the stage for disputes betweenpolicy makers such as Budget Director Richard Darman, who iseager to press a variety of health-care initiatives, andpolitical advisers, who are wary of controversial measures inan election year.   Hints of the program may be included in the fiscal 1993budget that the president intends to submit to Congress Jan.29, and it may be mentioned in his State of the Union addressthe day before, but the detailed plan isn't likely to beunveiled until sometime in February.   To assist people with incomes too high to qualify for thenew tax credit, administration officials are looking at aplan to allow middle-class people -- probably with annualincomes of as much as $50,000 or $60,000 -- to deduct somehealth costs their employers don't pick up. The tax codecurrently allows people to deduct some medical expenses, butonly if they itemize and if their medical bills exceed 7.5%of adjusted gross income. The medical deduction was taken ononly 5.1 million of the 112.3 million tax returns filed for1989, according to the Internal Revenue Service.   Although certain to be popular with the middle-classbeneficiaries, the proposed deductions move away fromrecommendations made by some Republican health analysts whoadvocate limiting tax breaks for health care so thatindividual Americans will become more sensitive to healthcarecosts. But as a step in that direction, the administration isconsidering proposals to tax part of the employer-providedhealth benefits of highly paid workers.   The package is likely to include broad reforms to theprivate health insurance market that would streamlinepaperwork and make it easier for people and businesses toband into large risk pools, which would lower premiums. Oneof the main aims of the proposals is to abolish insurancecompanies' common practice of choosing policyholders based onmedical risk. It also would protect people with medicalconditions from losing employer-provided health insurance ifthey switch jobs.   Another important feature of any plan will be incentivesto encourage people to enroll in health maintenanceorganizations or other prepaid care providers, people withknowledge of the talks say. Such systems, where peoplereceive all medical services from a group of doctors for aprenegotiated fee, are less costly than traditional&quot;fee-for-service&quot; care.   Administration officials are discussing numerousincentives to encourage use of HMOs and other forms ofso-called managed care in the Medicare and Medicaid programs,primarily to save money. They aim to encourage states to runtheir Medicaid programs like Arizona, which alone among thestates assigns each Medicaid beneficiary to a managed-careprovider.   Through greater use of managed care, officials think theycan save large amounts of money in Medicare and Medicaid.Taken with other measures, the savings in the two programscould be as much as $75 billion to even $100 billion fromprojected expenditures over five years. (Despite the savings,spending on Medicare and Medicaid will still increase eachyear.)   Last year, the administration proposed cutting $25.2billion from projected Medicare spending over five years, byparing subsidies to research hospitals and other measures.Almost all those proposals died in Congress, but theadministration plans to submit them again. One key proposalthat the White House intends to repeat is charging Medicarebeneficiaries with incomes higher than $100,000 at leasttwice as much for Medicare premiums.   ---   David Wessel contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
