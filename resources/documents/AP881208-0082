William Kellogg went undefended Wednesday during the AmericanGeophysical Union's fall meeting when he asserted ``we are in thegrips of an irreversible global change'' that has already started towarm the atmosphere.   ``I liken my position to being like Daniel in the lions' den,''said Kellogg, a retired atmospheric scientist from the NationalCenter for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.   ``I think you're more like Chicken Little,'' replied retiredclimatologist Arnold Court, of California State University,Northridge.   ``There's going to be a greenhouse effect, but that doesn't saywhere or when it's going to happen. I'm denying it's here now,''said meteorologist Jerome Namias, who headed the National WeatherService's extended forecast division for 30 years.   The anticipated warming of the climate by carbon dioxide andother pollutants _ which trap heat from the sun like glass in agreenhouse _ ``is a very convenient scapegoat'' for the drought thatbaked much of the nation this summer, but there is no evidence itcaused the drought, said Namias, now with the Scripps Institution ofOceanography.   Many climatologists predict the greenhouse effect will warm theEarth's climate by 4 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit by about 2050,increasing total precipitation but making some areas drier, and alsoperhaps melting enough polar ice to raise sea levels and flood somecoastal areas. But they disagree on whether the phenomenon is underway.   Kellogg said records kept by the University of East Anglia inNorwich, England, show average global temperatures rose by 1.1 to1.4 degrees from 1880 to 1986, consistent with the theory thatcarbon dixoide from increased burning of fossil fuels has warmed theEarth since the industrial revolution.   Kevin Trenberth, a researcher at the Boulder center, saidtemperature measurements tend to be made in cities, which got warmerdue to rapid growth.   William Sprigg, director of the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration's climate office in Rockville, Md., said, ``The casehas not been made that greenhouse gases explain what we see.''   Namias said his study shows this year's drought fit the patternof many earlier dry periods and had many causes. The causes includedcomplex changes in interacting patterns of the jet stream and otherwinds, ocean and air temperatures, atmospheric pressure and soilmoisture, all of which ``explain what went on quite adequatelywithout the greenhouse effect,'' he said.   The drought has been blamed for at least $12.8 billion in U.S.agricultural losses.   In June, experts told a congressional committee that risingtemperatures worldwide, including four record-breaking warm yearsthis decade, were caused by a buildup of greenhouse gases.   James Hansen, a National Aeronautics and Space Administrationclimatologist, told the panel, ``The evidence is pretty strong thatthe greenhouse effect is here'' and the 1988 drought and heat wavewere examples of what would happen more frequently in the future.   ``The frequency of droughts in the United States over the pastcentury suggests that the drought of 1988 cannot be distinguishedfrom the normal climate variability of the past century,'' said TomKarl, of NOAA's Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C.   Namias emphasized the summertime drought over much of the nationis different than the wintertime drought that has plagued the WestCoast since 1986. Namias expects heavy rains this winter inWashington state, Oregon and Northern California, but said so far,they haven't materialized.</TEXT></DOC>
