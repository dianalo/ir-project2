Kennedy andMartin Luther King Jr. slayings.   A decade has passed since the House Select Committee onAssassinations ended its work by concluding that Kennedy and Kingwere apparently the victims of conspiracies, but the committeedocuments, which scholars say would be important research tools,appear no closer to being opened to the public.   ``What we're talking about is the records of our politicalhistory _ two of the most important events of the 20th century,''said Kevin Walsh, a former committee aide who has led a small groupof private Kennedy researchers in the fight to open the records.   ``This is about the public's right to know.''   Most of the work conducted by the Warren Commission, whichconcluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the Kennedyslaying, has been opened to the public, a move that has helpedresearchers evaluate _ and in many cases strongly criticize _ thatinvestigation.   But the House committee, the only government investigation toconclude that conspiracies were involved in either murder, ran outof money and was dissolved before voting to release its documents.   Without such a vote, the materials fell under the House'sso-called ``50-year rule,'' keeping congressional documents underlock and key for a half-century.   The late Rep. Stewart B. McKinney, R-Conn., a member of theselect committee, had taken up the scholars' cause in Congress,fighting for a resolution to release most of the documents. But hedied in 1987.   Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, the committee chairman, originallyled opposition to that resolution, but had a change of heart afterMcKinney's death, from AIDS, and said he would work for theinformation's release.   That buoyed researchers, but the 1988 legislative session cameand went without any action on the committee documents.   House counsel Steven R. Ross said he expected Stokes to act nextyear on a measure that would immediately open some of the records,but he declined to provide specifics.   The committee sent shockwaves around the world in December 1978when it concluded that Kennedy's killing in 1963 was probably theresult of a conspiracy _ pointing to accoustic evidence thatexperts said clearly showed the presence of a second gunman. Thecommittee also concluded that a conspiracy likely was behind theKing slaying in Memphis five years later.   But in 1982, the National Academy of Sciences concluded thatthere was no evidence of a second Kennedy gunman and that theindependent experts used by the committee incorrectly analyzed atape recording made from a motorcycle policeman's open microphone.The experts' testimony had been the key to the committee'sconclusion; before it, the panel had planned to conclude that therewas no conspiracy.   Despite the academy study and the Justice Department's finalconclusion this year that there was no conspiracy in eitherslaying, Stokes stands by his committee's report.   ``It's a difference between scientists,'' Stokes said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Nov. 5-6</NOTE></DOC>
