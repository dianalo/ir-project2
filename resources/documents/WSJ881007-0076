The seven-count indictment by a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., accuses William G. Moore Jr., Recognition's chairman and chief executive officer; Robert Reedy, head of its marketing operation; and Peter Voss, a former vice chairman of the Postal Service, of &quot;circumventing, undermining and manipulating&quot; the agency's decision to purchase optical-scanning equipment for sorting mail.    Mr. Voss is identified as a primary conspirator in the alleged scheme, but wasn't charged in the indictment.    Overall, the indictment charges a pattern of graft and corruption extending to high levels of the Postal Service, with Mr. Voss, the two Recognition Equipment executives and other alleged conspirators agreeing in the fall of 1985 to &quot;set into motion a plan to remove&quot; the postmaster general at the time, Paul Carlin.    The defendants agreed that &quot;Carlin was an obstacle to their plan&quot; to obtain noncompetitive contracts for Recognition Equipment from the agency, according to the indictment.    Mr. Carlin was fired by the postal board of governors a few months later, but board members have said they acted out of general dissatisfaction with his performance.    The indictment identified former Postmaster General Albert Casey, who succeeded Mr. Carlin, as among three candidates recommended by Recognition Equipment officials and supported by other members of the alleged conspiracy.    According to the indictment, the alleged conspirators concealed their plans and secret financial ties from Mr. Casey. Mr. Casey hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing. Mr. Voss resigned in 1986, and pleaded guilty to accepting illegal gratuities and agreed to cooperate with investigators. No other current or former members of the postal board have been charged.    While the outlines of the alleged conspiracy previously were spelled out in court documents, the indictment provides new details about how Messrs. Moore and Reedy allegedly used their association with Mr. Voss and others to successfully push for the removal of a senior assistant postmaster general and influence agency procurement and policy decisions.    The indictment charges that the conspirators resorted to bid-rigging, payment of gratuities and embezzlement to obtain the inside track for Postal Service contracts in 1985 and 1986.    The grand jury also accused Messrs. Moore and Reedy, with the help of Mr. Voss, of illegally obtaining proprietary bidding information submitted by one of Recognition Equipment's competitors.    The document also charges Recognition Equipment with paying about $295,000 to Gnau andamp; Associates, a public-relations firm in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and associated companies also previously implicated in the conspiracy. Mr. Voss received at least $19,000 of that amount, according to the indictment.    The indictment caps the government's almost three-year investigation of the contract-steering scandal involving the Postal Service and additional charges aren't likely.    For his role in the scheme, Mr. Voss previously was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $11,000. John Gnau, president of the Michigan consulting firm, previously pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and paying an illegal gratuity. He was sentenced to three years in prison and fined $10,000.    If convicted, Recognition Equipment could be fined more than $3 million and be barred from winning future government contracts. The two executives each face a maximum of 33 years in prison and fines of as much as $1.5 million.    In Irving, Texas, Recognition Equipment said it doesn't believe it has done anything wrong and that it is confident it will be cleared. The maker of information-processing equipment said it hasn't had a chance to review the indictment, but that all of those charged will &quot;defend this matter to the fullest extent.&quot;    Charles Stillman, a New York attorney representing Mr. Moore, said his client is convinced that &quot;a full and fair trial of this indictment will reveal that&quot; Mr. Moore, Mr. Reedy and the company &quot;were victims of a carefully orchestrated scheme put into place by others.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
