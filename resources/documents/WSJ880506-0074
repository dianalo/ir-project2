The British builder's move was seen as a direct attempt to lay aside concerns -- raised both in federal court and in congressional hearings -- that a takeover of Pittsburgh-based Koppers would mean a loss of jobs and, therefore, could be considered harmful to the public interest.    Koppers, which has 700 employees at its headquarters and a total work force of about 11,000, had no immediate response to the proposal, but Wall Street observers said there was no chance the company would capitulate.    Beazer leads a group of suitors, BNS Inc., that has made a $1.69 billion, or $60-a-share, hostile tender offer for Koppers. The bid, which BNS again extended yesterday, to midnight EDT May 18, currently is being held up by federal court actions in Pittsburgh and in Los Angeles.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Koppers closed at $56.50 a share, up 25 cents.    Beazer -- which gave details of its plan in a letter from the company's chairman, Brian C. Beazer, to Koppers Chairman Charles R. Pullin -- maintained that it also would honor all of Koppers's civic contributions in Pittsburgh. Donations this year are expected to total $483,600.    Such enticements have been used by other suitors to complete acquisitions. For example, Houston Coastal Corp.'s acquisition of American Natural Resources in 1985 was spurred along by Houston Coastal's agreement to honor American's community commitments in Detroit.    But in a battle as bitter as the Koppers one, the latest Beazer plan probably won't make a difference. &quot;If anything, it will just make Koppers's management more emboldened,&quot; said one Wall Street trader who is playing the stock.    In a related announcement, Beazer said it added a supplement to its tender offer to try and persuade the Pittsburgh court -- which has been concerned with matters of financial disclosure -- to lift its preliminary injunction. The court, however, hasn't ruled that the additional disclosure is adequate.    And it isn't expected to make its ruling very soon, either. Judge Maurice B. Cohill, who is hearing the Koppers case, is now busy presiding over another jury trial. Moreover, he isn't expected to hand down his Koppers decision until after a California appeals court, concerned with antitrust issues, hears arguments next week.    Even then, the judge might want the case to go to trial. Indeed, while some of the concerns he raised in issuing the preliminary injunction can easily be met -- it's a matter of supplying additional documents -- other questions, regarding bank borrowing rules, may require detailed testimony.    Said the Wall Street trader: &quot;They're in this for the long fight.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
