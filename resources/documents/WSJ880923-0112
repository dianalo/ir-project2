Rembrandt Group Ltd., a major South African tobacco, finance and consumer-products company controlled by the Rupert family, earlier this week announced a complicated restructuring of its non-South African interests. The move will create Richemont Group, which intends to list its shares on a Swiss stock exchange and won't have any &quot;legal or operational&quot; ties to South Africa. But the Ruperts and other founding holders effectively will control the European concern, with #819.9 million ($1.37 billion) of assets.    The Rembrandt move and the bid for Consolidated Gold reflect common concerns. Minorco S.A. is 60.1%-held by the Oppenheimer family's big South African mining companies, Anglo American Corp. of South Africa and De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. London-listed Minorco bid #2.05 billion for the 70.6% it doesn't already own of Consolidated; Minorco also announced plans to sell London-based Consolidated's remaining South African assets to create a powerful European-based company.    Neither group says so explicitly, but both apparently hope to insulate their non-South African operations from possible future sanctions. U.S. legislators, for instance, already have banned imports from certain state-related South African companies and could someday seek to extend the ban to other companies. The offshore companies also could offer some protection for their wealthy owners if they ever have to leave South Africa.    &quot;What the Oppenheimers are doing is only what a number of the big South African firms have been doing recently,&quot; said Brian Bolton, a Bromyard, England, consultant who recently completed a report on South African investment in Britain.    Most South African companies firmly voice their commitment to the country and vow to blunt the impact of Western sanctions, he noted. &quot;How this marries up with the creation of Richemont and the meanderings of Minorco is presumably that some of these people are playing a double game,&quot; Mr. Bolton said. &quot;At the end of the day, it's money they worry about, and they want to insure their own invulnerability.&quot;    Werner Rey, an influential Swiss businessman, likens the plight of South African companies to that of Hong Kong concerns worried about the 1997 transfer of the colony to the Chinese. Those companies &quot;are restructuring wherever the environment seems most appropriate.&quot;    For some South African companies, Britain looms large. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has stood fast against calls for sanctions. &quot;It's no coincidence at all that this is happening in Britain, given the posture adopted by Her Majesty's government,&quot; said Mr. Bolton, who supports Britain's Anti-Apartheid Movement, a special-interest group. &quot;We've said, come on in, we need your money and we don't care whether it's rands, yen or dollars.&quot;    South African executives deny any hidden motives. Johann Rupert, the son of Rembrandt's founder and managing director of Richemont, said the group's formation doesn't represent a disengagement from South Africa. Rembrandt spent nearly 800 million rand ($324 million) on acquisitions in South Africa last year and could buy some of Consolidated's South African holdings if Minorco succeeds in its takeover bid.    Mr. Rupert said in a telephone interview yesterday that the announcement caps a five-year effort to secure a position inside the European Community. Richemont's operations will be based in Luxembourg. &quot;The Europeans as a whole may find it to Europe's advantage to exclude non-Europeans and as such we wanted to be inside,&quot; he said. &quot;If this is a European company I don't see how they {the Europeans} can discriminate against us.&quot;    For anti-apartheid activists favoring disinvestment, the new South African-backed companies present perplexing questions. South African interests effectively will control Swiss-listed Richemont.    Are Minorco or Richemont shares acceptable for investors who want to avoid South Africa? &quot;This is a new one,&quot; said Marcy Murningham of Boston-based Lighthouse Investment Group, which advises U.S. companies on South African issues. &quot;It will catch people off guard.&quot;    Said Mr. Rey, the Swiss financier: &quot;Nobody is fooled that there are still South African interests behind these groups, but I am not sure people really care that much.&quot;    The Minorco and Rembrandt moves highlight the extent of South African industry's foreign holdings, which don't have to be disclosed under South African law. Minorco listed $3.02 billion in net assets at June 30. But Rembrandt hadn't disclosed the size of its overseas assets. Whatever flag they reside under, the assets have substantial allure. The new Richemont group will hold about 33% of the common stock of Rothmans International PLC, a United Kingdom-listed tobacco company whose brands include Benson andamp; Hedges cigarettes. Philip Morris Cos. of the U.S. controls 29.4% of Rothmans. Richemont also holds major stakes in the producers of such luxury goods as Dunhill tobacco and accessories and Cartier jewelry.    Richemont and Minorco dismiss suggestions that their South African heritage will hamper their maneuvering room.    Richemont isn't wasting any time trying to acquire and hold &quot;investments in other companies in Switzerland or abroad,&quot; as its objectives are described in an offering prospectus. It owns 10.7% of the common shares and 50.8% of the preferred of Transatlantic Holdings PLC, a U.K. financial company that has amassed nearly 26% of Sun Life Assurance Society PLC.    Transatlantic is partly-owned by South African insurer Liberty Life Association of Africa Ltd. Last week, Sun Life, fearing a potential takeover, announced a cross-shareholding agreement with France's Union des Assurances de Paris that it believes may insulate it from a bid. </TEXT></DOC>
