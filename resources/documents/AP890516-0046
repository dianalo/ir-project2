Once again, when confronted with the realities and conflictingpressures of governing, Bush opted for compromise.   His speech Monday from the steps of the U.S. Capitol includedechoes from his campaign, including his call for greater use of thedeath penalty, tougher sentencing and increased prison construction.   But on the touchy question of gun control, he sounded fardifferent.   His calls for a ban on large-capacity cartridge magazines andfor import restrictions on assault-style weapons were welcomed bygun control advocates. But while taking that action, the presidentdeclined to move against assault-style rifles manufactureddomestically.   A month ago, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater suggested _and it was nothing more than a suggestion _ that a ban ondomestically manufactured assault-style rifles could be part of theBush crime package.   The press secretary said was there was ``some unfairness''because the ban on imported weapons would have no impact on salesof U.S. made rapid-fire rifles.   ``Unfortunately, it is not something we can do anything about,''said Fitzwater. ``To do anything about domestically manufacturedweapons would require a change in the law.''   That change was never requested.   What Bush did request was a prohibition on manufacture and saleof magazines that carry more than 15 cartridges, a position thatputs him on the same side as Democratic Sen. Howard Metzenbaum ofOhio.   But Metzenbaum also wants to ban sales of new assault-styleweapons made in the United States. The Ohio senator argues thatlimiting imports only deals with about 25 percent of the weapons.   The day that Bush delivered his speech, the National RifleAssociation ran a full-page ad that attacked Metzenbaum's bill.   ``Do you honestly believe that banning some, or even all,semiautos will stop drug dealers, street gangs or any violentcriminals from getting any gun illegally?'' asked the NRA ad.   Some anti-crime proposals such as mandatory gun-relatedsentencing have a wide range of support.   The NRA ad suggested alternatives that were identical to some ofBush's key proposals, including barring plea bargaining for anyfelony committed with a gun, mandatory sentencing for crimescommitted with a gun, and increased prison construction.   Metzenbaum also supports a 10-year mandatory sentence and moremoney for new prisons.   But there was a distinct difference in tone between the speechBush gave to the National Peace Officers Memorial Service and hiscampaign rhetoric.   His audience on a rainy Monday included relatives of the 161police killed in the line of duty last year. As he did so oftenduring his campaign, Bush recalled how he had been given the badgeof 22-year-old Eddie Byrne, a New York police officer killed bywhat the president called ``a gang of cocaine cowards.''   But during the campaign, Bush took a no-compromise position ongun control.   ``My opponent favors gun control and I do not,'' he said inspeech after speech. ``I don't believe in new restrictions on therights of citizens to own arms.''   As a president faced with a growing wave of drug-relatedviolence, Bush is inching away from that hard line.   ``The right to own a gun is not a license to harm others,'' hesaid Monday, using language unlike any he uttered during thecampaign.   When he was attacking the Massachusetts prison furlough programlast year, Bush aides assured reporters that as president he wouldorder a review of the federal prison furlough program.   A source in the Bureau of Prisons said no general review of thefederal program has been done although wardens have been instructedto take a harder look at prisoners before they are grantedfurloughs.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Donald M.
