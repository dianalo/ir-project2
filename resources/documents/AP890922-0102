Arab League envoy Lakhdar al-Ibrahimi made the announcement afteran hour-long meeting with Gen. Aoun at his office in a bunker underthe bomb-ravaged presidential palace in Beirut's suburb of Baabda.   ``I am glad to inform you that the general has accepted the terms(of the plan) and has agreed that we start working to implementthem,'' said Ibrahimi, assistant secretary-general of the 22-memberArab League.   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who heads aSyrian-backed Cabinet vying for legitimacy with Aoun's Christiangovernment, and Parliament speaker Hussein Husseini, a ShiiteMoslem, have already accepted the plan.   Shiite militia chieftain Nabih Berri and Druse warlord WalidJumblatt, who are Syria's main allies in Lebanon also have endorsedit.   Ibrahimi, an Algerian diplomat, was asked by an Arab Leaguecommittee to head a security committee to supervise the cease-fireand monitor ships to ensure no weapons supplies reach Lebanesefactions.   Aoun initially said he would not send a representative to such acommittee because it did not include a Syrian representative. Hesaid Syria was trying to portray the crisis as one among Lebanesefactions, even though Syrian forces in Lebanon are the main partyfighting his Christian troops.   But France and the United States, traditional backers of theChristians, and several Arab governments voiced support for thepeace plan and urged Aoun to display flexibility to avoid furtherbloodshed.   ``Thank God, all the brethren in Lebanon have agreed that westart implementing this plan,'' Ibrahimi said.   The Arab League plan, drafted by leaders of Saudi Arabia, Moroccoand Algeria, calls for a cease-fire, lifting of blockades andopening Beirut airport.   It also invites the 73 surviving members of Lebanon's 99-seatParliament to meet outside the country to formulate politicalreforms. These would give the country's Moslems, an estimated 55percent of the population, an equal share of power with thetraditionally dominant Christians.   In another development, an oil tanker carrying badly neededgasoline for Lebanon's besieged Christians played hide-and-seek forthree hours with Syrian artillery before slipping into port beforedawn.   Police said the Lebanese-flagged Timex Star ran the gantlet ofradar-controlled Syrian shellfire to deliver its cargo of 660,000gallons of fuel at Jounieh, 12 miles north of Beirut.   ``The captain ducked into a bay north of Jounieh, puttingmountains between him and the Syrian radar and blocking it. Then hehugged the coast to slip into port,'' a police spokesman said.   The spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said the Syrians usedlong-range artillery in Moslem west Beirut, from mountainsoverlooking the Christian enclave and in north Lebanon, in theireffort to sink the Timex Star.   The Christians, critically short of fuel after a 6-month-longSyrian blockade, began unloading the fuel 15 minutes after thetanker docked.   Syrian attempts to sink the tanker caused an artillery duelbetween the Syrians and Aoun's forces in and around Beirut that lefttwo people killed and seven wounded, police said. That raised thetoll to 929 killed and 2,738 wounded since the latest fighting beganMarch 8.   The Christians control a 28-mile strip of coast north of Beirut.With their enclave ringed on its three landward sides by the Syriansand their Lebanese Moslem militia allies, the coastal strip is theironly lifeline.   In the 14-year-old civil war, more than 150,000 people have beenkilled and more than 1 million of Lebanon's 4 million people havebeen displaced.</TEXT></DOC>
