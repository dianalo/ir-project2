Williams, Acting Chief,Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Departmentof the Interior, Room 634-Arlington Square, Washington, DC 20240 (703-358-1714).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information: </T2>The annual process for developing migratorygame bird hunting regulations deals with regulations for early and lateseasons. Early seasons include those which may open before October 1, whilelate seasons may open about October 1 or later. Regulations are developedindependently for early and late seasons. The early-seasons regulationscover mourning, white-winged and white-tipped doves, band-tailed pigeons,rails, moorhens, and gallinules, woodcock, and common snipe; sea ducksin the Atlantic Flyway; September teal; experimental September duck seasonsin identified States; experimental September Canada goose seasons in portionsof identified States; sandhill cranes in the Central and Pacific Flyways;doves in Hawaii; migratory game birds in Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the VirginIslands; and some extended falconry seasons. Late seasons include the generalwaterfowl seasons; coots, moorhens and gallinules, and common snipe inthe Pacific Flyway; and extended falconry seasons.Certain general procedures are followed in developing regulations for theearly and late seasons. The data used in regulatory decisions were outlinedin the March 27, 1989, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 12534). At this time the Service doesnot have complete data from the spring breeding ground surveys but a preliminaryassessment of duck breeding habitat was developed in mid-May. The habitatconditions in the prairie-parklands continue to be dry and duck productionprospects are poor. Restrictive duck regulations were enacted in 1988 inresponse to poor habitat conditions, reduced duck breeding populations,and expected poor fall flights. The Service notes that if populations needadditional protection, further framework restrictions, to include, butnot limited to, outside dates, season lengths and bag limits, will be consideredin the development of regulations for the 1989-90 hunting season. In addition,all aspects of past regulations which may have a bearing on possible harvest,are being reviewed. Some actions on early-season regulations will haveto be based on information from the May surveys.Initial regulatory proposals are announced in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>document published in March and opened to publiccomment. These proposals are supplemented, as necessary, with additional<T4>Federal Register </T4>documents. Comments in response to the Marchdocument that support or oppose proposed preliminary regulations are notlisted in this supplemental document. They will be considered in the regulationsdevelopment process. This document does contain recommendations that requireeither new proposals or substantial modifications of existing proposalsin order to facilitate effective public participation. Following reviewof comments received and after public hearings, the Service further developsand publishes proposed frameworks for times of seasons, season lengths,shooting hours, daily bag and possession limits, and other regulatory elements.After consideration of additional public comments, the Service publishesfinal frameworks in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The Service responses to comments and proposalsdo not appear in this supplemental or subsequent proposed rules but willappear in the two final frameworks documents. Using these frameworks, Stateconservation agencies than select hunting season dates and options. Uponreceipt of State selections, the Service publishes a final rule in the<T4>Federal Register, </T4>amending Subpart K of 50 CFR Part 20, to establishspecific seasons, bag limits, and other regulations. The regulations becomeeffective upon publication. States may prescribe more restrictive seasonsthan those provided in the final frameworks.The regulations schedule for this year is as follows: On March 27, 1989,the Service published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 12534) a proposal to amend 50 CFR Part20, with public comment periods ending as noted above. The proposal dealtwith establishment of seasons, limits, and other regulations for migratorygame birds under andSection;andSection; 20.101 through 20.107, 20.109, and20.110 of Subpart K. This document is the second in a series of proposed,supplemental, and final rules for migratory game bird hunting regulations.Comment periods on this second document are specified above under <T2>DATES. </T2>Final regulatory frameworks for migratory game bird huntingseasons for Alaska, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and early seasonsin other areas of the United States are targeted for <T4>Federal Register </T4>publication on or about August 9, 1989; and thosefor late seasons on or about September 18, 1989.On June 22, 1989, a public hearing will be held in Washington, DC, as announcedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of March 27, 1989, to review the status of mourning,white-winged, and white-tipped doves; band-tailed pigeons; rails; moorhensand gallinules; woodcock; common snipe; and sandhill cranes. Recommendedhunting regulations will be discussed for these species and for migratorygame birds in Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; September tealseasons; experimental September waterfowl seasons in designated States;special sea duck seasons in the Atlantic Flyway; and extended falconryseasons.On August 3, 1989, a public hearing will be held in Washington, DC, asannounced in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of March 27, 1989, to review the status and recommendedhunting regulations for waterfowl not previously discussed at the June22 public hearing.This supplemental rulemaking describes a number of changes which have beenrecommended based on the preliminary proposals published on March 27, 1989,in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>Statements and comments are invited.<ITAG tagnum="84">Review of Public Comments</ITAG>Written Comments ReceivedAs of May 8, 1989, the Service had received comments on proposals publishedin the March 27, 1989, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 12534) from 16 correspondents, including4 States, 2 organizations, all four waterfowl flyway councils, and 6 individuals.In some instances, the communications did not specifically mention theopen comment period or the regulatory proposals; however, because theywere received during the comment period and generally relate to migratorygame bird hunting regulations, they are treated as comments. The Serviceseeks additional information and comments on the recommendations containedin this supplemental proposed rule. These recommendations and all associatedcomments will be considered during development of the final frameworks.Early-season frameworks will be proposed in late June and late-season frameworksin early August, Responses to written comments and those received at thepublic hearings will be included in the appropriate final frameworks <T4>Federal Register </T4>documents, at which time, additional data aboutthe status of affected species will be available.General CommentsThe Service is currently reviewing many special harvest strategies andtools for migratory game bird management. The Service requested informationfrom the Flyway Councils and States on these harvest stratgegies whichinclude zones, splits, management units, special seasons, bonus birds,and the point system. The Service reiterates that any action on these itemsis likely to be deferred until the review is complete, which likely willnot occur prior to the 1989-90 hunting season. New proposals and modificationsto previously described proposals are discussed below. Wherever possible,they are discussed under headings corresponding to the numbered items inthe March 27, 1989, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (at 54 FR 12536).1. <T3>Shooting hours. </T3>The Service believes clarification is needed inregard to shooting hours and falconry. The first consideration is thathunting hours for falconry will be the same as those for other means oftaking migratory birds. The second is that States need not consider falconryseasons in determining the ``earliest duck season opening date * * * latestduck season closing date'' (at 54 FR 12539, item 1b) in their State.2. <T3>Frameworks for ducks in the conterminous United States_outside dates,season length and bag </T3><T3>limits. </T3>Framework dates. At its March meeting, the Central FlywayCouncil recommended that framework dates be standardized to open on theSaturday nearest October 1 and closing on the Sunday nearest January 20,as was in effect in 1984-85.4. <T3>Wood ducks.</T3> The recommendation for September Duck Season bag limitswill impact wood ducks (see Item 8).8. <T3>September Duck Seasons. </T3>At its March meeting, the Atlantic FlywayCouncil endorsed a recommendation that the bag limit be 4 wood ducks onlyduring the Experimental September Duck Season in Florida. The Council notesthat low harvest levels, low band recovery rates, and a low portion ofnorthern wood ducks in the harvest are compatible with providing increasedopportunity for harvesting southern wood ducks without jeopardizing thesustained welfare of wood duck populations.14. <T3>Frameworks for geese and brant in the conterminous United States_outsidedates, season length and bag limits.</T3>a. The Atlantic Flyway Council endorsed the following recommendations atits March meeting:i. That a 3-year experimental season be established for resident Canadageese in North Carolina west of Interstate 95 from September 1 throughSeptember 10. The daily bag limit would be 2 geese. The Council notes thatNorth Carolina's voluntary closure of the Canada goose season in that portionof the State west of Interstate 95 eliminated a means to harvest residentgeese within the regular season framework. Recreational opportunity toharvest resident geese has been lost and hunter support for efforts toprotect geese affiliated with the Southern James Bay population may declineas a result. The arrival of migrant geese in North Carolina appears tooccur after the proposed season dates of September 1-10.ii. That a 3-year experimental season be established for resident Canadageese in Georgia and last for 8 days between November 15 and February 5.The bag limit would be 1 goose per season. The Council notes that residentCanada geese in Georgia have increased to nuisance proportions and thepopulation is large enough to support a limited sport harvest. High levelsof recreational use, other than hunting, within the proposed hunt areas,prevent implementation of an early September resident goose season.iii. That the bag limit of Atlantic brant be increased from 2 to 4 birdsper day. The season length would remain at 50 days. The Council notes thatthe population increased and a large proportion of young birds warrantfurther liberalization of the existing regulation. The 1987-88 season frameworksallowed a 30-day season and 2 brant daily and was extended to 50 days in1988-89.iv. That the bag limit for greater snow geese be increased from 4 to 5birds per day. The season length would remain at 90 days. The Council notesthat populations are at high levels and crop depredation and habit degradationare resulting. Snow geese are adapting to hunting pressure, resulting inlower harvest levels Increasing the daily bag limit may stimulate interest,increase hunter participation, and increase harvest levels.v. That the experimental (special) snow goose season at Bombay Hook NWRin Delaware be expanded to include State areas adjacent to the existingarea. The Council notes that the 13-day seasons have been successful inmoving geese and minimizing late October damage to Spartina marshes atBombay Hook. The experimental hunts also provide additional hunting opportunity.b. The Upper Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Councilendorsed the following recommendations at its March meeting:i. That a 3-year experimental season be established to evaluate the effectivenessof a September 1 to September 10 season for reducing the growth of thelocal Canada goose population in the Southwest Border zone of Minneosta.The Council notes that giant Canada goose populations in this zone haveexceeded population objectives. Restrictive Canada goose seasons have madeit difficult to harvest adequate numbers of local Canada geese in thisarea in order to minimize nuisance and damage problems.ii. That a 3-year experimental season be established to evaluate the effectivenessof a September 1 to September 10 season for reducing growth of the Canadagoose population in the Fergus-Alex zone of Minnesota. The Council notesthat giant Canada goose populations in this zone have exceeded populationobjectives. Restrictive Canada goose seasons have made it difficult toharvest adequate number of local Canada geese in this area in order tominimize nuisance and damage problems. iii. That Iowa be permitted to change the boundary of its Southwest Goosezone to include DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge and associated feedingareas. Goose seasons in this zone have generally been held 2 weeks laterthan those in the rest of the State. The Council notes that snow geesein western Iowa have migrated later in recent years. The requested changewill allow the snow goose season in the vicinity of DeSoto National WildlifeRefuge to better coincide with the period when snow geese are present.A slight harvest increase may occur in some years, but snow goose populationsare increasing. iv. That Indiana be permited to split its goose season in existing zonesinto 3 segments. The Service notes that 3 segments in zoned areas previouslyhave not been permitted. c. At its March meeting, the Pacific Flyway Council recommended liftingrestrictions on hunting western Canada geese in 2 California areas (SacramentoValley and San Joaquin Valley). There is currently no open season for Canadageese in the Sacramento Valley area, while the hunting season for Canadageese in the San Joaquin Valley area currently closes no later than November23. The Council notes that western Canada goose hunting is consistent withharvest management objectives for Pacific population Canada geese, butacknowledges potential concerns for Aleutian and cackling Canada geesewintering in these areas. 15. <T3>Tundra swans. </T3>There were two errors regarding the tundra swanseasons in the preliminary proposal. The following statements correct theseerrors and clarify the swan framework in the Pacific Flyway.a. It is again proposed that permits in the Pacific Flyway portion of Montanawould be valid in Teton, Cascade, Toole, Liberty, Hill, and Pondera Counties.b. It is again proposed that tundra swan hunts in the Central Flyway portionof Montana run concurrent with the season dates for taking geese.c. In the Pacific Flyway eligible States may select a 93-day season betweenSeptember 30 and January 21.24. <T3>White-winged and White-tipped Doves.</T3>a. In the March 27, 1989, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (at 54 FR 12542), the Service reviewed a requestfrom Texas for an experimental dove bag limit. At its March meeting, theCentral Flyway Council recommended establishment of a 3-year experimentaldove bag limit study during the 4-day special season for white-winged dovesin Texas. The aggregate daily bag limit of 12 white-winged, mourning, andwhite-tipped doves would permit no more than 2 white-tipped doves but wouldallow up to 12 mourning doves. The Council notes that these 4 days (duringthe first 2 weekends in September) are part of, and not in addition to,the 70-day mourning dove season in Texas. The daily aggregate bag is currently10 white-winged, mourning, and white-tipped doves to include no more than2 mourning doves and 2 white-tipped doves. The Council further notes thatthe restricted bag limits have limited recreational opportunity and contributedto economic problems.b. In a letter dated May 2, 1989, Texas recommended their initial proposalbe modified to limit the aggregate bag limit to 10 doves per day, not morethan 5 of which can be mourning doves or 2 of which can be white-tippeddoves, except that in the special white-winged dove area upriver from DelRio, the aggregate daily bag be allowed to contain up to 10 mourning doves.The State reports there is very little late-nesting of mourning doves inthe upriver area.If the experiment is approved, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Departmentproposes to monitor the effects of the experimental bag limit with (1)additional mourning dove call-count surveys, (2) a nesting chronology study,(3) an egg and nestling survival study, and (4) harvest surveys. Resultsof these surveys will be used in formulating bag limit recommendationsat the end of the 3-year experimental period.25. <T3>Migratory bird hunting seasons in Alaska. </T3>At its March meeting,the Pacific Flyway Council endorsed Alaska's existing frameworks with nochange for the 1989 migratory bird hunting frameworks. In 1988, shootinghours for migratory game birds in Alaska began one-half hour before sunrise.In the March 27, 1989, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (at 54 FR 12542) the Service proposed that shootinghours for Alaska begin at sunrise and end at sunset. The Council notesthat, during the hunting season, Alaska receives greater illumination atone-half hour before sunrise than the contiguous United States.27. <T3>Migratory game bird season for falconers. </T3>See item 1 (Shootinghours). Because of the framework extension granted for falconry in 1988the Service believes that the number of season segments allowed needs tobe established. The Service recommends not more than 3 segments be allowedfor falconry seasons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Invited</ITAG>Based on the results of migratory game bird studies now in progress andwith due consideration for any data or views submitted by interested parties,the possible amendments resulting from this supplemental rulemaking willspecify open seasons, shooting hours, and bag and possession limits fordesignated migratory game birds in the United States, including Alaska,Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.The Service intends that adopted final rules be as responsive as possibleto all concerned interests, and therefore desires to obtain the commentsand suggestions of the public, other concerned governmental agencies, andprivate interests on these proposals. Such comments, and any additonalinformation received, may lead to final regulations that differ from theseproposals. The addresses where comments should be sent and where receivedcomments are available for public inspection were given earlier in thisdocument under the caption <T2>ADDRESSES</T2>.Special circumstances are involved in the establishment of these regulationswhich limit the amount of time that the Service can allow for public comment.Specifically, two considerations compress the time in which the rulemakingprocess must operate: the need, on the one hand, to establish final rulesat a point early enough in the summer to allow affected State agenciesto appropriately adjust their licensing and regulatory mechanisms, and,on the other hand, the unavailability before mid-June of specific, reliabledata on this year's status of some migratory shore and upland game birdpopulations. Therefore, the Service believes that to allow comment periodspast the dates specified is contrary to the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="84">Flyway Council Meetings</ITAG>Department of the Interior representatives will be present at the followingmeetings of Flyway Councils:<T3>Atlantic Flyway</T3>_Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (Desgovzerneurs) July28-29<T3>Mississippi Flyway</T3>_Saginaw, Michigan (Saginaw Sheraton) July 29-30<T3>Central Flyway</T3>_North Platte, Nebraska (Holiday Inn) July 27-28<T3>Pacific Flyway</T3>_Reno, Nevada (Peppermill Hotel) July 28Although agendas are not yet available, these meetings usually commenceat 8:30 to 9 a.m. on the days indicated.<ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Consideration</ITAG>The ``Final Environmental Statement for the Issuance of Annual RegulationsPermitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FES 75-54)'' was filedwith the Council on Environmental Quality on June 6, 1975, and notice ofavailability was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 13, 1975 (40 FR 25241). The ``Final SupplementalEnvironmental Impact Statement for the Issuance of Annual Regulations Permittingthe Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds'' was completed and filed with theEnvironmental Protection Agency on June 9, 1988, and a Notice of Availabilitywas published in the June 16, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 22582). Copies of these documents areavailable from the Service at the address indicated under the caption <T2>ADDRESS</T2>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Endangered Species Act Consideration</ITAG>Consultations are presently underway to ensure that actions resulting fromthese regulatory proposals will not likely jeopardize the continued existenceof endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adversemodification of their critical habitat. It is possible that the findingsfrom the consultations, which will be included in a biological opinion,may cause modification of some of the regulatory measures proposed in thisdocument. Any modifications will be reflected in the final frameworks.Hunting regulations are designed, among other things, to remove or alleviatechances of conflict between seasons for migratory game birds and the protectionand conservation of endangered and threatened species and their habitats.The Service's biological opinions resulting from its consultation undersection 7 are considered public documents and are available for publicinspection in the Division of Endangered Species and Habitat Conservation,and the Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,Department of the Interior, Washington, DC 20240.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12291, and the PaperworkReduction Act</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> dated March 27, 1989 (54 FR 12534), the Servicereported measures it had undertaken to comply with requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act and the Executive Order.
