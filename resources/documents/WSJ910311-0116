Seib   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>03/11/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A11</SO><CO>   MDEST</CO><LP>   WASHINGTON -- In the midst of their happiness over thesweeping allied victory over Iraq, U.S. policy makersprivately are vexed by one particular question: Why are sixAmericans still being held hostage in Lebanon?   The answer is that, even as the Middle East landscape isbeing redrawn, the radical, Iranian-inspired cells holdingWestern hostages probably are finding entirely new reasons tohang on to them. Some of these reasons are wholly unrelatedto the kidnappers' original motivations. They suggest thatthe ordeal of these forgotten hostages may be far from over.</LP><TEXT>   Put bluntly, the captors keep their hostages because &quot;theyhad hoped to get a price for them and nobody has come by witha price for them,&quot; says former Central Intelligence Agencyanalyst Graham Fuller. The U.S., beyond using its newfoundfriendship with Syria to lobby for their release, can't domuch more to free the hostages now than it could before thewar with Iraq.   The issue is particularly perplexing because the crisisover Iraq's invasion of Kuwait ignited a series of changesthat should be good news for the hostages, all of whom arebelieved held by factions associated with the radicalHezbollah organization.   Many of the hostages originally were seized in an attemptto force Kuwait to free the Dawa 17, a group of terroristswith links to Iran and Hezbollah who were jailed for a seriesof 1983 bombings of Western installations in Kuwait. AfterIraq's invasion of Kuwait last August, the 17 apparently weresprung from jail, and U.S. intelligence analysts believe theyhave made their way back to Lebanon. One of the 17 was thebrother-in-law of Hezbollah terrorist Imad Mugniyah, whosedesire to free his relative was believed to have been aprincipal motivation for the kidnapping of Westerners inLebanon.   The shifting positions of Syria and Iran also should bodewell for the hostages. Syria used the distraction of the warto tighten its grip over Lebanon, and it seems to have made adecision to shift allegiances away from Moscow and toward theWest. As a result, it should be more willing and able to helpfree U.S. hostages.   Iran also illustrated during the war that it wanted to beseen more as a responsible international citizen. It resistedrepeated Iraqi entreaties to enter the war to fight againstthe U.S.-led allies and impounded Iraqi warplanes sent toIran.   But the hostage holders in Lebanon probably are hanging onto their victims precisely because they want to disrupt thesepro-Western trends, U.S. officials believe. The Hezbollahhostage holders don't want Syria and Iran to build strongerties to the West. If the presence of hostages is animpediment to that process, the captors presumably are happyabout it.   In addition, Iran's desire to use its influence to helpmay be limited, U.S. officials believe. While Iran seems tobe angling for better relations with the West over the longrun, it is agitating right now against a long-term U.S.military presence in the Persian Gulf. So it isn't likely todo the U.S. many favors until the troops that fought Iraqhave gone home.   Beyond that, there is the simple fact that the hostageholders are, in the words of one official, &quot;local operators&quot;who aren't completely under the thumb of any outside power.They undoubtedly are pleased that they have seen the Dawaprisoners in Kuwait freed without having to release any oftheir own hostages.   So now they may be setting a new price for the captives,such as the release of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Hezbollahleader abducted by Israeli commandos in 1989. They also mayintend to extract a price from Syria, such as an agreementallowing Hezbollah freedom of operation in the new,Syrian-dominated Lebanon.   Certainly the noises from Hezbollah aren't encouraging.One of its leaders claimed in an interview last week that thegroup wasn't happy with the continued hostage-holding butwouldn't do anything to stop it. That's sad news for all thehostages -- particularly for Associated Press correspondentTerry Anderson, who has been held the longest. Next Saturday,he will begin his seventh year of captivity.</TEXT></DOC>
