The burst, GB830801, occurred at 22:14:18 UT on 1 August 1983and was one of the strongest ever observed. The total fluence was 2 x10/sup -3/ erg cm/sup -2/, most of which occurred in the first 4 s ofthe burst. Simultaneously, a change was observed in the amplitude ofa very-low-frequency (VLF) radio signal from a transmitter in Rugby,England, monitored at Palmer Station, Antarctica, indicative of an ionosphericdisturbance. Weaker disturbances were also recorded at the same receivingsite on signals from VLF stations in Annapolis, Maryland and Lualualei,Hawaii. The times of the burst and the disturbances are coincident withinthe 10-s resolution of the VLF recording system.</TEXT></DOC>
