THE HORROR .andP;  .  .andM;So, you think you're safe.andP;  You think your company doesn't need powerprotection.andP;  That's what a major insurance company in the midwest thoughttoo.andP;  Then their telephone and computer systems got zapped and they suffereda half-million dollars of damage -- $400,000 of that was damage to theirphone system.andM;They learned the hard way.andM;In order to protect your phone system from power disturbances, both yourtelephone line and your AC power must be protected.andP;  The power that comesdown the telephone line is fairly clean and stable.andP;  The phone companyinstalls a primary protector at your building entrance to prevent fires andother major catastrophes, but this protection is not designed to protect yourphone system.andM;With a telephone line, the two things to watch out for are lightning andpower crosses.andP;  Lightning can cause a power surge even if it strikes somedistance away.andP;  Power crosses involve someone crossing an AC power line withyour telephone line -- usually somewhere in your building.andM;AC power disturbances take many forms.andP;  The ones we hear about the most arespikes, surges, blackouts, brownouts and sags.andM;Spikes, also called transients, are increases in voltage lasting only a fewmillionths of a second.andP;  They can really pack a wallop though, reachingseveral times the normal peak voltage.andP;  Surges are a lot like spikes, theyjust last longer.andP;  A surge can last a fraction of a second to severalseconds.andM;Blackouts are familiar to everyone.andP;  This is when no electricity is comingdown the line and the lights go out.andM;Brownouts are when the lights dim rather than go out.andP;  Technically it's an&quot;undervoltage.&quot;andP;  A hot summer day when everyone has their air conditioner onis prime time for a brownout.andP;  You may notice a certain sepia tone to yourlighting (hence &quot;brownout&quot;?) or you may not notice a thing.andP;  Sags are verybrief undervoltages.andM;Other power gremlins to look out for are noise (or oscillations), frequencyaberrations (when the current departs from its 60 Hz cycle) and staticelectricity.andM;Ac power disturbances can be caused by everything from lightning, to demandson the local utility, to the normal operation of office equipment andappliances.andP;  For example, a photocopier creates a power disturbance withevery copy it makes.andM;You're still not convinced?andP;  No lightning bolts have crashed through yourceiling lately and the power company seems pretty reliable.andP;  Unfortunately(or is it fortunately?) power problems are not always as dramatic as alightning strike or a blackout.andP;  You may not even realize they are occurring.andM;Mike Yardley of Alpha Systems reports that an industrial plant located in aresidential area outside of Milwaukee was having problems with their largePBX.andP;  Every day at about four o'clock the PBX would start to do strangethings.andM;It was pretty annoying, but they couldn't find any reason for the PBX'sstrange behavior.andP;  After searching high and low they figured it out.andP;  At fouro'clock each afternoon everyone would start coming home in the residentialarea that surrounded the plant.andP;  And when they came home they would turn ontheir microwaves, blenders and other appliances.andM;All this residential activity was draining the local power supply.andP;  The PBXwas very sensitive to low voltage.andP;  The daily &quot;brownout&quot; was the cause of theproblem.andM;Alpha recommended a UPS and a separate circuit for the plant.andP;  Problemsolved.andM;Don't get us wrong.andP;  Power disturbances are not a once-in-a-lifetime event.andO;Several years ago IBM conducted a study of AC power disturbances, chroniclingthe average occurrence of problems at a building entrance.andP;  They found that,on average, 7.5 power disturbances were occurring each week.andP;  There were 1.5sags each month, one spike each month and one surge.andP;  The power went out atthe building entrance an average of .6 times each month.andM;Not to be outdone, Bell Labs conducted a study of power disturbances at yourtypical wall receptacle.andP;  They recorded four sags per month, two spikes andone power failure each month for an average of 1.8 disturbances a week.andM;That's a lot of opportunities for damage to occur.andP;  And you are still takingchances?andP;  Like using a seat belt, those who protect themselves can often walkaway from a nasty power accident, while those who don't get creamed.andM;Sue Hinterliter of The Siemon Company reports that a company in Pennsylvaniaprotected its phone system well.andP;  When a low impedance to earth groundoccurred (that's a short circuit to you and me) their phone system escapedunscathed.andP;  The central office did not do as well -- their equipment wasdamaged.andM;Then there is the bittersweet experience of the company that protected theirkey system with a surge protector from EMI.andP;  When they were hit with a surge,the key system was fine -- but everything that wasn't plugged into the surgeprotector was fried.andM;Oh yeah.andP;  That large insurance company finally got smart.andP;  John MacKay of EFItells us they installed $30,000 worth of protection equipment after &quot;the bigblow out&quot; and they haven't had a single electrical problem since.andM;Hindsight is 20/20, isn't it?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
