During the design phase, the order of successionof transients is not known. In that case, the codes require to take theorder of events which leads to the maximum damage, but they don't givethe detailed rules to perform it. The method we present here consistsin building the totality of possible loading histories. For each loadinghistory we calculate the creep fatigue damage V+W. The choice of themost severe loading history is done a posteriori. In practice, we arelead to uncouple the calculation of V and W. We proceed as follows: 1.Build all the loading histories able to masimize V. 2. For each of theseloading histories, maximize W. 3. Choose a posteriori the most damagingloading history.</TEXT></DOC>
