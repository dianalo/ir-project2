Unit Pleads No Contest In Contributions Case </HL><SO> </SO><CO> SO GPE+ </CO><IN> UTI </IN><G> IRS JUS </G><DATELINE> ATLANTA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Southern Co.'s Georgia Power unit pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge that employees illegally forced subordinates to contribute to the election campaign of a member of the state Public Service Commission.    The charge, filed yesterday in state court, stems from an investigation ordered by Gov. Joe Frank Harris of the Southern Co. unit last month on the recommendation of Attorney General Michael Bowers. Mr. Bowers said that questions were raised in documents released by the federal court.    The charges surfaced as a side issue from an ongoing investigation by the Internal Revenue Service that Georgia Power and several other companies defrauded the federal government out of millions of dollars by accounting improperly for spare parts, and setting up an illegal &quot;off-the-books&quot; accounting system. In addition, a federal grand jury in Atlanta is looking into the company's accounting practices. The company has denied any criminal wrongdoing.    The state attorney's office charged that Georgia Power's management wrongfully encouraged a number of its employees to support, with their own personal funds, commission candidate Bobby Rowan's campaign during an August Democratic primary this year. In Georgia it is illegal for people acting on behalf of a commission-regulated public utility to contribute to the campaign of a commission candidate. Officials of the state attorney's office were unavailable for comment.    Robert W. Scherer, in a news conference last month, denied that the company improperly influenced the election by ordering employees to contribute to one candidate's campaign. &quot;If any Georgia Power employee feels that he or she was pressured, in any way, to make a political contribution, I will personally reimburse that employee out of my own pocket,&quot; Mr. Scherer said at that time.    In a statement yesterday, Georgia Power said it agreed to pay a $1,000 fine in relation to the charge, but maintained it &quot;did not knowingly break the law.&quot; The company said although the law has never been &quot;tested or defined in the courts,&quot; it sought to avoid a &quot;lengthy trial.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
