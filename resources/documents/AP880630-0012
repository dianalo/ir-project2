The high court's 7-1 decision Wednesday removes a cloud from theIran-Contra conspiracy case, and it clears the way for thesentencing of former White House aide Michael K. Deaver for lyingunder oath about the lobbying business he formed after leavingPresident Reagan's staff.   The ruling also removes the special prosecutor issue from formerWhite House political director Lyn Nofziger's challenge to his90-day sentence and conviction for illegally lobbying formeradministration colleagues.   And the court's decision revives independent counsel AlexiaMorrison's long dormant investigation of allegations that formerAssistant Attorney General Theodore B. Olson lied to acongressional committee investigating the Superfund scandal at theEnvironmental Protection Agency.   Challenges by Olson and two other former high-ranking JusticeDepartment officials to grand jury subpoenas obtained by Morrisonled to the high court's ruling on the independent counselprovisions of the Ethics in Government Act.   ``Obviously we are very pleased with the opinion andparticularly at the fact that it was reached nearly unanimously bythe court,'' said Morrison, whose investigation has been stymiedfor nearly a year.   The high court, in a decision written by Chief Justice WilliamRehnquist, rejected arguments that appointment of independentcounsels by a special court violated the Constitution's doctrine ofseparation of powers.   Rehnquist wrote that the special prosecutors did not encroach onthe power of the executive branch to investigate crimes.   The decision drew an impassioned dissent from Justice AntoninScalia, who wrote that ``by its short-sighted action today, I fearthe court has permanently encumbered the Republic with aninstitution that will do it great harm.''   Ruling as it did, the court further validated the authority ofindependent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to prosecute former WhiteHouse aide Oliver North, former national security adviser John M.Poindexter and others on charges stemming from the Iran-Contraaffair.   Walsh accepted a parallel appointment offered by the JusticeDepartment last year to blunt constitutional challenges to the law.   But if the high court had ruled the other way, North, Poindexterand their co-defendants might have been able to challenge evidenceWalsh gathered before he was given the second appointment.   Harvard University law professor Laurence H. Tribe, whorepresented Walsh, said the court found that ``vague notions ofseparations of powers are not enough to justify invalidating''Congress' solution to ``a serious problem that would otherwisewould have undermined credible law enforcement.''   James C. McKay, the independent counsel who prosecuted Nofziger,also accepted a backup appointment five weeks after he began hisinvestigation.   If the law had been invalidated, Nofziger would have challengedthe use of evidence obtained by McKay before he was given theparallel authority.   Morrison and Deaver's prosecutor, independent counsel WhitneyNorth Seymour Jr., refused to accept the Justice Department'soffer, choosing instead to set the stage for the constitutionalbattle.   Deaver's conviction was put in jeopardy in Jan. 22 when the U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled 2-1 that the special prosecutorlaw was unconstitutional.   Following that decision, U.S. District Judge Thomas PenfieldJackson stayed further proceedings in the Deaver case pending finalresolution of the issue by the high court.   Seymour called the decision ``a major victory for the publicinterest'' and said he would for ask Jackson to set sentencing ``atan early date.''   Deaver could be sentenced up to five years for each of threefelony convictions for lying to a House subcommittee and a grandjury that investigated his lobbying activities for possibleconflict-of-interest violations.   Deaver himself requested appointment of an independent counselwhen questions were raised in 1986 about the propriety of hislobbying contacts with former Reagan administration colleagues.   But his lawyers later tried to stop his indictment and trial bychallenging Seymour's authority to bring the charges.   Defense lawyer Randall J. Turk acknowledged the importance ofthe independent counsel challenge, but said, ``We have a number ofissues still pending before the trial court and if we don't prevailthere, we plan to pursue an appeal.''   E. Lawrence Barcella, one of Nofziger's lawyers, said the highcourt's decision is not a serious setback.   ``Our challenge has always been focused on the post-employmentsections of he Ethics in Government Act, the vagueness of thatstatute and the application of the facts to that statute,''Barcella said.   Nofziger remains free pending appeal of the conviction.   ``This office has believed that there is an appropriate placewithin the framework of the Constitution for the establishment of aprocess which eliminates the inherent conflict of interest whicharises when a high official of the executive branch is investigatedby the Department of Justice,'' said McKay, who is also concludinga lengthy probe of Attorney General Edwin Meese III.   McKay is not expected to bring criminal charges against Meesebut is preparing a lengthy report that could raise questions aboutthe ethical propriety of some of his financial dealings.</TEXT></DOC>
