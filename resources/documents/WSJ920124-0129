However, I was left feeling dissatisfied withthe edited portion of my letter that actually appeared inprint. I would like to emphasize strongly that although I didencounter anti-Japanese feelings on the two occasionsmentioned, these were isolated events, and that my family andI thoroughly enjoyed the many years we lived in the U.S.America has become a part of me and, far from holding anygrudges, I have made building bridges of friendship andunderstanding between the U.S. and Japan one of my lifegoals.   I believe that rather than bickering over our differences,we need to work harder at building bridges of appreciation.Izumo enjoys a sister-city relationship with Santa Clara,Calif. Because of the personal relationships establishedduring the various exchange programs between our two cities,America has taken on a face for the citizens of Izumo, andperhaps Japan has taken on a face for the citizens of SantaClara. I think it would be very beneficial to Japan-U.S.relations if each of the 656 cities in Japan could share thistype of bond with an American city. Perhaps it is easy toharbor feelings of hostility against a country when one knowsnothing about it except its location on a map. However, ifone can look at that same map and recall the smiling face andfriendly wave of a fellow human being, it might motivate thepeople of both countries to work harder at resolving ourdifferences.</LP><TEXT>   Tetsundo Iwakuni   Mayor   Izumo City   Izumo, Japan</TEXT></DOC>
