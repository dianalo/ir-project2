Now, he says, ``the paper union is in trouble.''   The United Paperworkers International Union and theInternational Brotherhood of Firemen and Oilers abruptly called offstrikes against the world's biggest paper company on Monday atmills in Jay and in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.   Union leaders cited a desire to give strikers an opportunity toreturn to the mills, where the average annual salary had been$37,000 before the strike.   The end came as the unions faced the prospect of losing itsstrike benefits, the paperworkers union faced decertificationelections and support lacked for expansion of the strike to otherIP mills where union members are working without contracts.   The strike _ over premium pay and work rule concessions _ couldhave been successful if all IP locals working without contractsthreatened to walk off the job, said Ben Burdetsky, a professor inthe School of Government and Business Administration at The GeorgeWashington University.   ``As long as the employer is able to keep running, there islittle impact that a union can have,'' Burdetsky said.   The strikes affected only the Androscoggin Mill in Jay and millsin De Pere, Wis., and Lock Haven, Pa. More than 1,000 workersremain locked out at an IP mill in Mobile, Ala.   When other locals failed to join the effort, the strikers shouldhave realized the company could get along without them, Crayposaid. ``From that point on it (the strike) was foolhardy.''   But even with union support across the country, the strike stilllikely would have failed because IP kept its mills running withhundreds of replacement workers, contends Michael Avakian, generalcounsel for the Center on National Labor Policy in NorthSpringfield, Va.   ``They should have known in advance that there is a readilyavailable supply of labor in the market,'' he said. ``When theunions engage in economic activities, they can't have a blind eyeto the competition for those jobs.''   The strike's failure was the latest in a string of union defeatsthat include the failed 1985-86 meatpackers strike against Geo. A.Hormel Co.'s flagship plant in Austin, Minn., and the Reaganadministration's firing of thousands of striking air trafficcontrollers in 1981.   Strikes still can be effective, Burdetsky said, but ``if youcan't inflict pain, don't strike.''   Craypo said that given International Paper's financial strength,there was little likelihood the strike could have been effective.   International Paper, with 45,500 employees in 33 states and 15countries, demonstrated it could easily weather the showdown. Thepaper company showed a profit for the first nine months of 1988 of$548 million, up 94 percent from $282 million in 1987. Revenue rose21 percent to $7 billion from $5.8 billion.   Union leaders admit they lost a battle, but say it is just onesmall fight in a larger ``corporate war.''   ``On paper we've lost it, but as the ashes sift down, there'llbe some hot coals there and we will try to fan them,'' said JohnChouinard, a UPIU shop steward in Jay.   Chouinard blamed the union's national leaders for the``beating'' the workers took, saying they encouraged the strike butfailed to fully support the effort at the local level.   ``They pulled the rug out from under us,'' he said.   Labor consultant Ray Rogers, who was hired by the unions toconduct a corporate campaign against International Paper, saidstrikers can claim victory for showing solidarity within locals andfor making unprecendented contacts with 20 other paperworkersunions working without contracts at other IP mills.</TEXT></DOC>
