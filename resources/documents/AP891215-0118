Sakharov remained free during his toughest years as adissident because he held a unique position in Soviet society thatstymied official attempts to silence or expel him.   Because of his top-level scientific reputation and the hugesupport he received from the West, authorities feared that jailingSakharov could threaten Kremlin leader Leonid I. Brezhnev'sstruggle to forge a 1970s detente with the United States.   Soviet authorities sometimes dealt with troublesome dissidentsby expelling them from the country. But because Sakharov was a keydeveloper of the Soviet hydrogen bomb, the security-obsessedbureaucracy couldn't imagine that course, either. Once abroad,officials feared, Sakharov could divulge critical Soviet nuclearsecrets.   Meanwhile, the honors Sakharov won for his scientific work andhis membership in the Soviet Academy of Sciences gave himprivileges that set him far apart from other dissidents, who wereoften impoverished and little-known.   Foreign visitors, including parliament members and diplomats,came frequently to Sakharov's apartment in a prestigious area ofdowntown Moscow. As a result of his academy membership, thephysicist enjoyed a hefty salary and the use of chauffeured cars,even as he suffered surveillance by the KGB and vilification in theofficial press.   Yet the threatening police presence around him and the officialdenunciations still put pressures on Sakharov that requiredsubstantial personal courage. His colleagues in the Academy ofSciences frequently castigated him in public, although they nevervoted him out of membership, and he often received threateningletters.   And he never knew when his espousing of human rights andenvironmental causes might lead to the abrupt end of hisprivileges, and his fall into the world of brutal repression wheremany other dissidents lived.   Until he was banished to the city of Gorky in 1980, sufferingmany of the horrors that other dissidents faced, Sakharov's specialstatus made it natural for him to become a central figure in thedissident movement in Moscow. Dissidents felt that if they couldonly contact Sakharov and get him to speak for them, they wouldacquire a measure of safety from persecution.   Sakharov in reality could offer them little protection, but herarely failed to welcome them. Dissidents from all over the nation,sometimes 15 or 20 at a time, squeezed into his two-room apartmenton Chkalova Street in Moscow to beseech him for help, and to meetwith Western reporters.   The book-lined, disorderly apartment was usually filled with thesmell of tea brewing in the kitchen. As many as seven members ofthe Sakharov family, who slept at night on sofas and the floor,milled around with the visiting dissidents, foreign camera crewsand foreign supporters.   Yelena Bonner, Sakharov's outspoken wife, presided over thechaos, sometimes giving interviews herself or jumping in to answera question asked of Sakharov.   The telephone rang constantly. Authorities at times cut off hisinternational phone service, but Sakharov usually was able to makeand receive calls within Moscow and often relayed messages from onedissident to another. Sakharov's mail service functioned, too,bringing him as many as 20 appeals for help a week from dissidentsthroughout the Soviet Union.   Sakharov believed the mail was read and the phone callsmonitored by authorities, but felt he had little to fear because hemade no secret of his dissident activities.   Along with his Academy of Sciences salary of 530 rubles a month_ nearly three times that of the average Soviet worker _ Sakharovhad other privileges stemming from his three ``Hero of the SovietUnion'' awards for his scientific work. By showing a special card,he could ride buses and subways for free, get priority airline andtrain tickets and go to the head of lines at stores and theaters.   He traveled occasionally, sometimes attending the trials ofdissidents in other cities.   Yet despite his special status, Sakharov suffered manypressures. Frail in appearance, he often seemed stung anddespairing after a new press attack or a threatening, anonymousphone call. When he visited a foreign diplomat or journalist, KGBagents would tail him by car. There were rumors the neighbors inhis apartment building had been recruited to spy on him.   Yet Sakharov never seemed interested in leaving the country ortoning down his dissident activities.   ``I have never considered emigrating. Not for one minute. Itnever entered my head,'' he said in 1977, the year President JimmyCarter sent him a strong letter of support that gave him a newmeasure of safety.   Sakharov's freedom did not last indefinitely. In 1980, theauthorities finally stripped him of his official honors and thenexiled him for six years to Gorky, a city closed to foreigners.There, Sakharov was almost entirely isolated from the outside worldand subjected to a far higher level of threats and harassment thanhe ever experienced in Moscow. Sakharov staged hunger strikes inprotest. The authorities responded with painful force-feeding.   According to his wife, a doctor in Gorky once told him: ``Wewon't let you die, but we will make you an invalid.''   But the state never jailed him and never expelled him from thescientific community _ an enduring sign of Sakharov's special rolein Soviet life.</TEXT></DOC>
