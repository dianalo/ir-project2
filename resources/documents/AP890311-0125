Thousands of guerrillas blasted Jalalabad in a relentless attackwith long-range rockets and heavy artillery, said Mohammad Shoaib ofthe Jamiat-e-Islami insurgent group.   The city, Afghanistan's fifth-largest, is seen by the guerrillasas a stepping stone to the capital of Kabul, 75 miles to the west.   ``Fighting is close to and around the city,'' said Shoaib.``There are rumors that some mujahedeen (guerrillas) have enteredthe city from the north, but there is no confirmation.''   Several guerrilla sources said the insurgents now control a keygovernment garrison on the outskirts of Jalalabad, which is 45 mileswest of the border with Pakistan where many guerrilla groups arebased.   The guerrillas captured as many as 500 government troops in thebattle for the post, said Naeem Majrooh of the Afghan InformationCenter, which opposes the Marxist government.   Majrooh said casualty figures ``are very high. Most of the deathsare from mines and bombardments.''   The government of Afghan President Najib said 1,500 guerrillashad been killed in the weeklong fighting around Jalalabad. It didnot give figures for government forces.   The official Soviet news agency Tass said Afghan governmentforces in Jalalabad attacked the rebels with bomb strikes androckets, killing 350 insurgents and wounding 200. It said governmentunits suffered 15 killed and 12 wounded.   Tass also said a large government convoy reached Jalalabad fromKabul with arms, ammunition and reinforcements.   Western journalists returning from the Afghan-Pakistani bordersaid a convoy of ambulances was headed for Pakistan.   The International Committee of the Red Cross runs a hospital inPeshawar, Pakistan, about 30 miles from the border, and the staffreportedly was working around the clock treating war wounded.   Afghanistan's official Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, saidnine rockets hit the capital Saturday, killing one person andinjuring another.   The Tass dispatch said a Soviet civilian jet of the Aeroflotairline was slightly damaged in a rocket attack on Kabul airport.   It did not say if the plane was on the ground or in the air or ifthere were any casualties, but it said the rockets killed anunspecified number of people in residential buildings mear theairport.   Najib asked the United States and the Soviet Union to interveneto stop the fighting, according to a radio report Friday.   The United States, Pakistan and Iran have aided the guerrillas.The Soviets in February withdrew the last of their troops fromAfghanistan after nine years of intervention in support of thegovernment.   Boris Yelstin, the former Moscow Communist Party chief, revealedSaturday in a speech that only four men made the fateful decision tosend Soviet troops into Afghanistan: President Leonid Brezhnev,Defense Minister Dmitri Ustinov, Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko andPolitburo ideologist Michael Suslov.   Yeltsin, who was demoted from Moscow party chief aftercriticizing the party leadership, was the first official to name theindividuals involved in the decision, which led to the deaths of15,000 Soviet troops. It had long been believed that only a few topofficials were involved.   The guerrillas have been fighting the government since a Marxistcoup in 1978 and have vowed to overthrow Najib now that the Sovietsare gone.   They recently formed an interim government and on Friday heldtheir first Cabinet meeting inside Afghanistan, about seven milesfrom the border in eastern Paktia province.   An alliance of seven guerrilla groups that operates fromPeshawar, Pakistan, formed the government with hopes it willeventually replace Najib's.   Sudan on Saturday extended formal recognition to the rebelgovernment.   The move made Sudan the second country, after Saudi Arabia, torecognize the government.   Malaysia's foreign minister said Saturday his country willpropose that other Moslem countries recognize the guerrillagovernment at the Organization of Islamic Conference meeting inSaudi Arabia on Monday.   Foreign Minister Abu Hassan Omar said he would present theproposal at the conference.</TEXT></DOC>
