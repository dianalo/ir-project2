Introduction </ITAG>On December 7, 1988, the Texas Funeral Service Commission filed a secondpetition for exemption for the State, of Texas from the FTC's Funeral Rule,16 CFR Part 453.\1\<NOTE/> An earlier petition for exemption, filed on February 21,1984 by the Texas State Board of Morticians (the predecessor to the TexasFuneral Service Commission), was denied by the Commission on December 4,1986.\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Texas petition has been placed on the public recordas Document No. XXIII-15, FTC File No. 215-46. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 51 FR 43746 (December 4, 1986). Section 453.9 of the Funeral Rule provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">If, upon application to the Commission by an appropriate state agency,the Commission determines that: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) There is a state requirement in effect which applies to any transactionto which this rule applies; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) That state requirement affords an overall level of protectionto consumers which is as great as, or greater than, the protection affordedby this rule; then the Commission's rule will not be in effect in thatstate to the extent specified by the Commission in its determination, foras long as the state administers and enforces effectively the state requirement.</ITAG>Factors which will be considered by the Commission in determining whetheran exemption is warranted include such things as the means available tothe state to enforce its provisions, the existence of any private rightsof action by an aggrieved consumer, and the scope and format of requiredprice disclosures to funeral consumers.\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Statement of Basis and Purpose, 47 FR 42260, 42287 (September24, 1982). Exemption proceedings are conducted pursuant to andSection; 1.16 of the Commission'sRules of Practice. In addition, the staff of the Bureau of Consumer Protectionhas published guidelines for petitions for state exemption from the FuneralRule.\4\<NOTE/> These guidelines were not formally approved or adopted bythe Commission; however, they represent the views of the staff of the Bureauof Consumer Protection. Specifically, the guidelines explain: (1) The materialswhich should comprise a complete petition for state exemption from theFuneral Rule; (2) the procedures required by Commission rules for consideringexemption applications; and (3) the procedures staff will recommend theCommission follow in granting, denying, or revoking exemptions from theFuneral Rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 50 FR 12521 (March 29, 1985). The exemption guidelines also state that additional procedures for publicparticipation, such as oral hearings or a rebuttal comment period, maybe scheduled if necessary for a full and fair presentation of significantfactual issues.\5\<NOTE/> A determination as to whether such procedures will be necessaryin this instance has not been made at this time. Any interested party mayrequest that the Commission schedule such additional proceedings. Suchrequests should be sent to the Office of the Secretary and should set forthspecific reasons why such additional proceedings are necessary to a fulland fair presentation of relevant factual issues.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ 50 FR at 12525-26.The Commission invites written public comment on the December 7, 1988 petitionby the State of Texas for exemption from the FTC Funeral Rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Texas Petition </ITAG>A. Background The first Texas exemption petition was filed on February 21, 1984, priorto the effective date of the Funeral Rule on April 30, 1984, and was supplementedby six additional filings that concluded on March 4, 1985.\6\<NOTE/> During the public comment period, which lasted from November6, 1985 to January 27, 1986, comments were received from 11 parties, including:the Consumer Protection Division of the Office of the Attorney Generalof Texas; Mr. T. Grady Baskin, Jr., a former member of the Texas StateBoard of Morticians; five memorial societies; Consumers Union; the GrayPanthers of Austin; and two individual consumers.\7\<NOTE/> All of the commenting parties urged that the Commission denythe Texas exemption petition. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The first Texas exemption petition and supplemental filingswere placed on the public record as Document Nos. XXIII-2-7 and 13, FTCFile No. 215-46. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The comments were placed on the public record as DocumentNos. XXIV-24-29 and 31-37, FTC File No. 215-46. The petition was denied because the Commission concluded that Texas lawfailed to provide an overall level of protection to consumers as greatas that provided by the Funeral Rule. Specifically, the Commission citedthe following areas in which Texas law afforded consumers less protectionthan the Funeral Rule: \8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ 51 FR 43747-48.  1. Under Texas law, consumers who entered a funeral establishment and inquiredabout the availability of arrangements, but did not ask specifically aboutprices, might not be entitled to price disclosures as they would underthe Funeral Rule. In addition, the state law covered only individual consumers,but not other entities such as memorial associations. 2. The Texas law did not define or limit the ``services of funeral directorand staff'' which might be included in a non-declinable fee. Thus, it didnot prevent all tying arrangements that are prohibited under the FuneralRule, and, as a result, consumers could be denied choice in the selectionof funeral goods and services. 3. The Texas law did not mandate the timing of the provision of price listsand the itemized statement of goods and services selected to consumers.Thus, under Texas law consumers might not be provided with price disclosuresprior to the selection of goods and services as required by the FuneralRule. The Commission noted that several commenters had alleged inadequate enforcementof the state law. However, the Commission determined that it need not addressthis issue since it had already determined that the petition should bedenied because   Texas law failed to provide consumers an overall levelof protection as great as that afforded by the Funeral Rule. The Commissionfurther noted that before an exemption petition could be granted, it wouldhave to make a determination that the state law was administered and enforcedeffectively.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ 51 FR 43747. B. Changes in Texas Law The current Texas exemption petition states, in Exhibit E, that since thedenial of the first exemption petition, ``Texas has taken positive stepsto correct any shortcomings in the state law and regulations.'' The followingchanges were cited: 1. The Texas mortuary law has been amended to define ``prospective customer''as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">`Prospective customer' means any consumer who enters a funeral establishmentand inquires about any funeral service, cremation, or merchandise. Thefuneral establishment may not make a distinction in providing funeral informationto any customer regardless of any affiliation of the customer or whetherthe customer has a present need for the services or merchandise.\10\<NOTE/> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes (hereafter VTCS), Article4582b, Section 1.V.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Texas statute requires that each customer or prospective customerbe provided with itemized written price information.\11\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ VTCS, Article 4582b, Section 3.H.22. See also 22 TexasAdministrative Code (hereafter TAC) 203.18, described in section II(B)(3)below. The Funeral Rule requires that a general price list be provided to personswho inquire in person about funeral arrangements or the prices of funeralgoods or services.\12\<NOTE/> A ``person'' is defined as ``any individual, partnership,corporation, association, government or governmental subdivision or agency,or other entity.''\13\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ 16 CFR 453.2(b)(4)(i). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ 16 CFR 453.1(n). 2. The regulations of the Texas Funeral Service Commission have been amendedto define the ``services of the funeral director and staff'' (which maybe a non-declinable fee) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">`Other itemized services provided by the funeral home staff' in TexasCivil Statutes, Article 4582b Section 1, S, shall include services of thefuneral director and staff which are not included in the prices of othercategories on the retail price list or written memorandum which may befurnished by a funeral provider in arranging and supervising a funeral,including but not limited to conducting the arrangement conference, planningthe funeral, obtaining necessary permits, placing obituary notices andany other services offered by the funeral establishment.\14\<NOTE/> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ 22 TAC 203.17. The regulations of the Texas Funeral ServiceCommission (formerly the Texas State Board of Morticians) have been promulgatedpursuant to VTCS, Article 4582b, Section 5.  This is very similar to the FTC definition of ``services of funeral directorand staff,'' except that Texas has added the phrase ``and any othcr servicesoffered by the funeral establishment.\15\<NOTE/> The Texas regulation also contains an anti-tying provisionthat is virtually identical to andSection; 453.4(b) of the Funeral Rule.\16\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ 16 CFR 453.1(o). However, the FTC definition does notpurport to be an exclusive list of the services that may be included withinthis fee. What is clearly excluded are services that are provided in connectionwith other items that the Rule requires to be separately listed on theprice list. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ 22 TAC 203.11(h). 3. With regard to the timing of the provision of price information, theTexas Funeral Service Commission has adopted the following regulation:<ITAG tagnum="21">In order to provide the maximum protection to the consuming public,the presentation of required price lists and purchase agreements will beas follows: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The retail price list, which includes the general price list,casket price list and outer burial enclosure price list, will be presentedfor retention to any consumer who inquires in person about any funeralservice, cremation or merchandise and prior to the consumer viewing orselecting any merchandise or service. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The written memorandum or funeral purchase agreement must be presentedfor retention to each person who arranges a funeral, cremation or otherdisposition of a dead human body upon the conclusion of the discussionof arrangements.\17\<NOTE/>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ 22 TAC 203.18.  The FTC Rule requires that a general price list be provided ``upon beginningdiscussion either of funeral arrangements or of the selection of any funeralgoods or funeral services,''\18\<NOTE/> and that casket and outer burial container price lists beprovided upon beginning discussion of, and before showing, the merchandise.\19\<NOTE/> The FTC regulation requires that the itemized statement ofgoods and services selected (``written memorandum'' in Texas nomenclature)be given to the customer upon conclusion of the arrangements discussion.\20\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ 16 CFR 453.2(b)(4)(i). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ 16 CFR 453.2(b)(2)(i) and (3)(i). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ 16 CFR 453.2(b)(5).  The Texas Funeral Service Commission asserts that as a result of thesechanges, ``Texas law now provides an overall level of protection to consumersas great as or greater than the Funeral Rule,'' and ``that the only criterionthat remains to be addressed is whether the state law is being administeredand enforced effectively.'' \21\<NOTE/> The Commission requests public comment on the issue of whetherthese recent changes in Texas law afford consumers protection as greatas, or greater than, the protection afforded by the FTC's Funeral Rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ FTC File No. 215-46, Document No. XXIII-15, Exhibit E. C. Other Differences Between Texas Law and the FTC Funeral Rule The three items discussed in section A, above, were the basis for the Commission'sdenial of the first Texas exemption petition. However, they were not then,and they are not today, the only areas of difference between Texas lawand the FTC Funeral Rule.\22\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ Other areas of difference were noted in the request forpublic comment on the first exemption petition. 50 FR 46271. The Commissiondid not form any conclusions regarding these other differences. The denialof the first exemption petition merely states that the three items discussedtherein ``illustrate its conclusion that state law provides less protectionthan the Funeral Rule.'' 51 FR 43747. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Transactions Covered by FTC Rule and Texas Law </ITAG>The Funeral Rule covers all funeral providers. The definition of a ``funeralprovider'' is ``any person, partnership or corporation that sells or offersto sell funeral goods and funeral services to the public.''\23\<NOTE/> Thus, the provisions of the Rule would extend to pre-needsellers who may not be licensed funeral directors.\24\<NOTE/> The jurisdiction of the Texas Funeral Service Commission,however, extends only to funeral establishments, licensed embalmers, orfuneral directors.\25\<NOTE/> Comments filed by the Consumer Protection Division of theTexas Attorney General's Office with regard to the first Texas exemptionpetition made clear that the Texas State Board of Morticians (predecessorto the Texas Funeral Service Commission) could not enforce state law againstan unlicensed funeral provider.\26\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ 16 CFR 453.1(j).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ However, the Rule would not cover such sellers if theywere engaged in the ``business of insurance.'' 16 CFR 453.8(c). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ VTCS, Article 4582b, Section 3.H. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ This letter was placed in the public record as DocumentNo. XXIV-34, FTC File No. 215-46.The Commission requests public comment on the following questions: (a)Are there persons in Texas selling or offering to sell funeral goods andfuneral services to the public on a pre-need basis, who would meet theFTC definition of a ``funeral provider'' and therefore be subject to therequirements of the FTC's Funeral Rule, but who would not be subject tothe authority of the Texas Funeral Service Commission because they arenot licensed funeral directors? (b) If the answer to (a) is ``yes,'' andthe Texas exemption petition were granted, would consumers of Texas beafforded significantly less protection than they now have with respectto pre-need funeral arrangements? \27\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ In a letter to the Attorney General of Texas, dated December20, 1988, FTC staff requested the views of the Consumer Protection Divisionon these and other issues raised by the current Texas exemption petition.This letter has been placed on the public record as Document No. XXIV-38,FTC File No. 215-46. Of course, if the Commission were to grant the Texaspetition, the exemption could be a partial one that would extend only tothose transactions regulated by the Texas Funeral Service Commission. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Required Price Itemization </ITAG>The Funeral Rule requires that consumers be provided with a general pricelist, showing prices for 17 specified items of service or merchandise,a casket price list, and an outer burial container price list.\28\<NOTE/> Texas law requires a retail price list which includes theprices of caskets and outer burial containers, and various other chargesfor services, facilities, and automotive equipment.\29\<NOTE/> The essential differences between the federal and state requirementsare that Texas does not require any descriptive information about the casketsor outer containers listed on the price list and does not require itemizedprices for other preparation of the body, other use of facilities, andother automotive equipment. (The Texas statute does list a category of``other itemized services provided by the funeral establishment staff.''However, the Texas regulations have defined this item as a professionalservices fee which, under both the Funeral Rule and Texas law, may be madea non-declinable item.\30\<NOTE/> Thus, it cannot be considered a catch-all category for othermiscellaneous items of service, facilities or automotive equipment.) Inaddition, Texas law does not require that alternative containers be separatelyitemized on the retail price list. However, it does require that pricesfor alternative containers be included in the package prices for minimalservices for direct cremation and immediate burial.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ 16 CFR 453.2(b) (2), (3) and (4).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ VTCS, Article 4582b, Sections 1.S, 3.H.22; 22 TAC 203.9,203.17, and 203.18.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ VTCS, Article 4582b, Section 1.S; 22 TAC 203.17; comparewith 16 CFR 453.1(o) and 453.2(b)(4)(iii)(C). <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Required Disclosures </ITAG>(a) Customer's right to choose only goods and services desired. The FTCFuneral Rule has required disclosures for both the general price list andthe itemized statement concerning the customer's right to choose and payfor only the items desired. Texas requires a dual set of disclosures foreach document. The disclosures required by the Texas Funeral Service Commissionrules track the language required by the FTC. However, the Texas statuterequires somewhat different wording, with a somewhat different meaning.On the general price list, the Funeral Rule requires the following disclosure:<ITAG tagnum="21">The goods and services shown below are those we can provide to ourcustomers. You may choose only the items you desire. If legal or otherrequirements mean you must buy any items you did not specifically ask for,we will explain the reason in writing on the statement we provide describingthe funeral goods and services you selected.\31\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ 16 CFR 453.4(b)(2)(i)(A).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The regulations of the Texas Funeral Service Commission require identicallanguage.\32\<NOTE/> However, the Texas statute requires the following notice:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ 22 TAC 203.11(h)(2)(A)(i).<ITAG tagnum="21">You may choose only the items you desire.

Prior Approval for Embalming </ITAG>Like the Funeral Rule, Texas law requires prior approval for embalming,or a reasonable effort to obtain such approval.\44\<NOTE/> However, the Funeral Rule also provides that the customerneed not pay for embalming performed without prior authorization if thecustomer selects funeral arrangements where the procedure is not needed.Texas has no comparable provision that would enable the customer to declinepayment under such circumstances.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ 16 CFR 453.5(a); VTCS, Article 4582b, Section 3.H.11;22 TAC 203.19 and 203.21(b)(1).

In other respects, provisions of Texas law are identical,or nearly identical, to provisions of the Funeral Rule. These include:telephone price disclosures; \45\<NOTE/> misrepresentations; \46\<NOTE/> required purchases; \47\<NOTE/> and comprehension of disclosures.\48\<NOTE/> Therefore, these areas do not raise any issue with regardto the level of protection provided by state law. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ Compare 16 CFR 453.2(b)(1) with 22 TAC 203.8. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ Compare 16 CFR 453.3 with 22 TAC 203.11 (a)-(f). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ Compare 16 CFR 453.4 with 22 TAC 203.11 (g) and (h).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ Compare 16 CFR 453.7 with 22 TAC 203.115.D.

Recent Enforcement History of the Texas Commission </ITAG>Exhibit H of the exemption petition is a statistical summary, for fiscalyears 1986-88, of establishment inspections, complaints received or initiatedby the commission, and actions taken by the commission. Complaints thatalleged violation of state law or regulations enforced by the commissionnumbered 60 in 1987 and 55 in 1988. The agency itself initiated (as a resultof its funeral establishment inspections) 11 complaints in 1987  and 106complaints in 1988. Three complaints were resolved through commission arbitrationin 1987 and eight in 1988. There were 23 formal disciplinary hearings in1987 and 15 in 1988.\74\<NOTE/> There were four informal disciplinary hearings in 1987 and29 in 1988. Two agreed orders were issued in 1987 and 20 in 1988. Licenserevocations, suspensions or probations numbered 17 in 1987 and 25 in 1988.In 1988, the first full year that the commission had authority to assessadministrative penalties, 132 penalties were assessed for a total dollaramount of $49,900. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\74\ The commission's authority to assess administrative penaltiesbegan on September 1, 1987. (Letter dated February 27, 1989, to Carol Jennings,FTC Funeral Rule Coordinator, from Larry A. Farrow, Executive Director,Texas Funeral Service Commission, Document No. XXIII-18, FTC File No. 215-46.)As a result the commission began to utilize administrative penalties and/oragreed orders to resolve complaints whenever possible to avoid time consumingand costly formal hearings.Exhibit I to the petition summarizes the complaints received during fiscalyears 1987 and 1988, including the allegations and the final commissionaction. There are 60 complaint summaries for fiscal year 1987. Eighteenof the 60 appear to involve allegations of conduct that would also constituteviolations of the FTC Funeral Rule. The primary allegations in these complaintscan be broken down as follows: 12 alleged failure to provide the customerwith required price lists or the written memorandum (itemized statementof goods and services selected); five alleged embalming without authorization;and one involved failure to properly complete the funeral purchase agreement(itemized statement). Two complaints involved the same funeral home. The disposition of these complaints was as follows: Three resulted in formalhearings: In one case (where the funeral home had been the subject of twocomplaints) the license was revoked; the other two hearings resulted indismissal. One case was closed after an informal hearing. One case wasresolved by agency arbitration, and another by an agreed order with thefuneral home and license suspension with probation. Two cases were closedwith a warning letter to the funeral home. Five were closed because ofinsufficient evidence, witness refusal to testify, or lack of substantiationfor the complaints. In another case, the allegations were disproved bythe investigation. One case was closed because the establishment was nolonger in business and the owner could not be located. Finally, two casesof alleged unauthorized embalming were closed because the embalming hadbeen ordered by the Justice of the Peace. There were 161 complaint summaries for 1988, of which 21 contained allegationsthat appeared to involve violations of the Funeral Rule as well as of Texaslaw. The allegations can be broken down as follows: there were 17 allegationsof failure to provide a price list or itemized statement (written memorandum);there were three charges of embalming performed without authorization;one complaint alleged a charge for an item not ordered; and one allegeda misrepresentation. (One complaint alleged both failure to provide a pricelist and embalming without authorization.) The disposition of these 21 complaints was as follows: fines were assessedin six cases (three for $500 and three for $250; in addition there wereagreed orders in two instances); six of these matters were closed becauseof insufficient evidence or lack of substantiation; in one matter the complaintwas withdrawn; in two cases there was a license suspension with probation(also an agreed order in one instance); six matters are still under investigation.FTC staff requested copies of the case files for 37 complaints that appearedto involve conduct that would violate the FTC Funeral Rule as well as Texaslaw. Because this request entailed an extensive amount of photocopying,it was agreed between FTC staff and the Executive Director of the TexasFuneral Service Commission that 20 case files would be submitted. Thesecase files have been placed on the public record.\75\<NOTE/> In addition, closed case files are available for public inspectionat the office of the Texas Funeral Service Commission, 8100 Cameron Road,Building B, Suite 550, Austin, Texas 78753.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\75\ The FTC request is Document No. XXIII-16, FTC File No.215-46.

He was ableto discuss funeral arrangements at 18 of these funeral homes. Only onefuneral home was found by Mr. Baskin to be in full compliance with statelaw. No enforcement actions were brought by the State Board as a resultof the Baskin survey.\77\<NOTE/> However, Mr. Baskin states he was informed by the AttorneyGeneral's office that as a Board member, he could not testify in any Boardproceeding.\78\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\76\ This document was placed on the public record, in FTCFile No. 215-46, as Document No. XXIII-10.

Do the recent changes in Texas law (summarized in section II(B) above)afford consumers protection as great as, or greater than, the protectionafforded by the FTC's Funeral Rule? 2. (a) Are there persons in Texas selling or offering to sell funeral goodsand funeral services to the public on a pre-need basis who would meet theFTC definition of a ``funeral provider,'' and therefore be subject to therequirements of the FTC Funeral Rule, but who would not be subject to theauthority of the Texas Funeral Service Commission because they are notlicensed funeral directors? (b) If the answer to 2(a) is ``yes,'' and the Texas exemption petitionwere granted, would consumers of Texas be afforded significantly less protectionthan they now have with respect to pre-need funeral arrangements? 3. Are other differences between the Funeral Rule and Texas law with regardto price itemization, required disclosures, and prior approval for embalming(summarized in sections II(C) (2), (3), and (4) above) significant, andwould they afford Texas consumers less protection than they now enjoy ifthe exemption petition were granted? 4. How do other provisions in Texas law that are not included in the FuneralRule (summarized in section II(D) above) affect the level of protectionprovided consumers by the state law? 5. Is the Texas law administered and enforced effectively? 6. Should the Commission grant the petition by the State of Texas for statewideexemption from the Funeral Rule? <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 16 CFR Part 453 </ITAG>Funerals, Funeral homes, Price disclosures, Trade practices.<ITAG tagnum="21">By direction of the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Donald S.
