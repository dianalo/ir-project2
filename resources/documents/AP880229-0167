Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis' staff debated the debate,with one aide saying he would not go and another saying thedecision on the League of Women Voters' forum in Nashville wasstill under consideration.   Word of candidates no-debate decisions tumbled out as thepresidential contenders themselves plunged into their final week ofcampaigning before the biggest delegate day of the primary season.   Meanwhile, Dukakis was celebrating another New England victory,in Maine, saying he will ``surprise some people in the South'' nextweek on Super Tuesday. Vice President Bush claimed victory in Maineon the GOP side.   The GOP presidential hopefuls split up today after criticizingeach other on taxes and trade in a debate Sunday in Atlanta.   Robertson, in Jacksonville, Fla., told about 500 people today,``I've got a feeling we're going to win in Florida and we're goingto win in the South. ... We've got one week to the most crucialelection, I believe, in the history of America, certainly thiscentury and maybe since its beginning.''   Dukakis and Gephardt, the winners of the major Democraticcontests so far, skipped a Democratic debate in Houston on Sunday.Gephardt aides said today that he wouldn't show up for a debate inopponent Albert Gore Jr.'s home state.   Gephardt, who had said last October he would participate in thedebate, sent word last week that he would not, noting that it wasto be in Gore's home state, said Janice Kaplan, a spokeswoman forthe League of Women Voters' presidential debates.   Dukakis aides passed out conflicting word on his intentions.Political director Paul Jensen said he would not attend the debate;communications director Leslie Dach said ``no official decision hadbeen made'' on whether or not to attend the Sunday debate.   League officials said Dukakis had told them last fall he wouldparticipate and they have heard of no change in that stance.   She said Robertson _ as well as Bush, who announced his plansearlier _ would not take part in the GOP debate the same day. BobDole has not formally agreed to attend, and the Republican debatewill be called off if he decides against debating, she said.   It was a son of the South, Jesse Jackson, who pulled theweekend's surprise, finishing a strong second to Dukakis in theMaine Democratic caucuses on Sunday.   With Super Tuesday looming barely a week away, Republican JackKemp sought to pump up his fading campaign with direct attacks onBush and Senate GOP leader Dole, saying they will not be true toRonald Reagan's legacy.   ``They sound alike. They talk alike. They've supported everysingle tax increase over the last eight years,'' Kemp said in atesty GOP debate Sunday in Atlanta. ``If they're nominated, theReagan revolution is over, gone, dead.''   Harsh rhetoric did not dim the good news from Maine for Bush andDukakis.   Bush's campaign claimed victory in the GOP caucuses on Sunday.With no official count available, his campaign gave out figuressaying he more than doubled his rivals' totals in the city and townmeetings.   On the Democratic side, Dukakis won the Maine caucuses easily,relying on a strong organization and his neighborly ties. He tookbetter than 40 percent of the delegates to the state convention andat least 10 national convention delegates.   ``Today's victory gives our national campaign another pushtowards success on Super Tuesday,'' Dukakis said.   Earlier, he told a crowd in Maryland _ where he hopes to do wellon March 8: ``You're an important Super Tuesday state. ... I thinkwe're going to surprise some people in the South.''   Dukakis' win was expected. Jackson's strong second-place showingwas not.   The black civil rights leader campaigned relatively little inthe state, but showed strength in many parts of the New Englandcountryside to win nearly a third of the vote. A block ofuncommitted delegates was in third place with the rest of theDemocratic field trailing.   Both Dukakis and Bush hoped to put another victory in theircolumn on Tuesday, when the non-binding Vermont primaries arescheduled.   The Democratic candidates gather for another pre-March 8 debatetonight in Williamsburg, Va., before the members of the DemocraticLeadership Council. It was DLC members who put together the idea ofa southern regional primary and then pushed state legislaturesacross the region to move their primaries to the early March date.   The Republicans' debate Sunday in Atlanta may be their lastfull-scale confrontation before Super Tuesday.   Bush, who is skipping the League of Women Voters' debate nextSunday in Nashville, told his three rivals that intra-party snipingis not useful.   ``There's no point in Republicans going around criticizing eachother or certainly criticizing the president of the United States.What we want to do is go after the people you had here yesterday,''Bush said, referring to the Democratic candidates who debated inthe same hall on Saturday. ``That's easy. That's slow-motion, slowtargets to go for.''   Kemp attacked hardest during the debate sponsored by the Atlantanewspapers, accusing his opponents of sounding like Democratichopeful Gephardt on trade.   ``Pat Robertson and Bob Dole sound like Dick Gephardt to me ontrade, and George Bush and Bob Dole say the budget deficit ispublic enemy No. 1. I want to say I believe the Soviet Union ispublic enemy No. 1,'' Kemp said.   For his part, Dole attacked Bush for the Reagan administration'sdecision to trade arms for hostages in the Iran-Contra affair.   ``We never should trade arms for hostages. We shouldn't issuethese reports and say we shouldn't trade arms for hostages _ thevice president's report _ and then later go to a meeting and sayit's all right. We shouldn't do those things,'' Dole said, holdingup a report on terrorism that was written by a commission headed byBush.   Bush did not respond directly, but did say ``mistakes weremade'' in the Iran-Contra affair. He has maintained throughout theaffair that he did not know the arrangement was an arms-for-hostagedeal.</TEXT></DOC>
