But the Italian concern, Ferruzzi Finanziaria SpA, said itswithdrawal of the U.S. District Court lawsuit was ``a technicalmatter only'' and that it is still preparing a suit seekingcompensation for the losses it incurred as a result of the Board ofTrade's order.   Ferruzzi has denied trying to corner the market.   The suit had sought to bar the exchange from enforcing its July11 order requiring all traders to reduce their holdings in the Julysoybean futures contract.   U.S. District Judge James Zagel in Chicago denied the request onJuly 13 and the July soybean contract expired on July 20, renderingthe lawsuit moot.   Ferruzzi said it withdrew the lawsuit on Tuesday.   ``Withdrawing the suit, which applied to an act governing aperiod which is now over, is a technical matter only,'' the companysaid in a statement.   Nevertheless, the Board of Trade hailed the action as a victory,saying the exchange ``welcomes this action, which demonstrates theintegrity of futures market self-regulation at the Board of Trade.''   Prior to the Board of Trade's order, Ferruzzi said it heldcontracts to take delivery of 23 million bushels of soybeans, whileBoard of Trade officials said that at the time, only about 12million bushels of soybeans were available for delivery againstthose contracts.   Ferruzzi, one of the world's largest soybean processors, hasdenied trying to corner the market, saying it needed all thesoybeans it had contracted to buy in order to keep its plantsrunning and meet the demand for its products.</TEXT></DOC>
