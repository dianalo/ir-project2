His goal: To create &quot;the great consulting firm of the1990s. Not one of the great firms. `The' great firm.&quot; Histactic: To give up United Research's independence. Last year,partners in the 31-year-old company sold control of UnitedResearch to Sogeti S.A., a holding company that owns CapGemini Sogeti, a $1.7 billion information-services companybased in Paris.</LP><TEXT>   Now another big U.S. consultant is following Mr. Teiger'slead. Last month, MAC Group Inc., a $74 million firm inCambridge, Mass., sold itself to Sogeti, too. MAC, Sogeti andUnited Research have already begun laying the groundwork fora new firm that will merge resources from all three.   Selling out to another company may not be everyone's ideaof a way to thrive. But some people insist it is: &quot;This is inno way a combination born of weakness or complacency,&quot; saysJames Kelly, co-managing director at MAC. &quot;I view it as acombination of real strength.&quot;   When management consultants plot strategy these days, thetalk often turns to mergers -- their own. Even once fiercelyindependent firms are deciding they can no longer afford togo it alone. Big firms gobble little ones; little ones fishfor boutiques. U.S. firms snap up consultants abroad, andforeigners shop here. Over the past two years, a dozen bigconsulting firms have decided to pool their forces.   The merger path isn't an easy one. In the past, severalbig companies -- including Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. and Citicorp-- bought consulting firms only to sell them back to theirmanagers when business faltered. Most recently, advertisinggiant Saatchi andamp; Saatchi was forced to dump most of itsconsulting-company acquisitions last year at fire-saleprices.   Still, many suggest that consolidation in the consultingindustry is inevitable. Ten years hence, 75% of the world'smanagement-consulting business may be handled by fewer than20 firms, compared with about 40 firms today, predicts CarlSloane, chief executive officer of Temple, Barker andamp;Sloane/Strategic Planning Associates, Lexington, Mass.   One reason is globalization, consultants say. Industryrevenue is growing much more rapidly in overseas consultingthan in domestic work. And with large corporate clientsincreasingly focusing on their international operations,consultants must follow suit.   When Temple, Barker andamp; Sloane partners were devising afive-year plan back in 1986, they saw a big hole in theirstrategy. They had no offices outside the U.S. To rectifythat, &quot;We had a sense we were talking about a minimum of ahalf a dozen {new offices} over five years, and 12 to 20 overa 10-year period,&quot; says Mr. Sloane. At an estimated $1million to $2 million per office, he says, &quot;we concluded wecould do it on our own, but it would be tight.&quot;   Within a year, the company had sold itself to insurancegiant Marsh andamp; McLennan. Last year, under Marsh andamp; McLennan'saegis, Temple Barker andamp; Sloane merged with Strategic PlanningAssociates, a Washington-based firm that has offices inLondon and Paris and plans to expand throughout Europe.   Even giant Sogeti feels its move abroad may be betteraccomplished through mergers. &quot;I'm not sure we will find anyother way to find the global coverage that our clientsrequire,&quot; says Michel Jalabert, president of Sogeti. &quot;Organicgrowth may not be appropriate in a fast-concentratingindustry.&quot;   Many consulting companies that started small find that,ironically, their own success pushes them into mergers.Consultants can often break into business with little morethan a good idea, or a popular concept. But once they grow,says Thomas Doorley III, who founded strategy firm BraxtonAssociates, they enter &quot;the valley of death,&quot; where they mustgrow even more -- or perish.   Firms of between 50 and 60 people with between $6 millionand $15 million in revenue are &quot;beginning to feel thesqueeze,&quot; says David Clinkenbeard, based in Fitzwilliam,N.H., who consults to consultants on acqusitions. &quot;Theyaren't large enough to have a national following, but they'rebig enough to have overhead costs.&quot;   Says Mr. Doorley: &quot;If you are going to train 10 people youcan just as cheaply train 20. You only need one room and oneperson.&quot; Braxton Associates sold itself in 1984 to theaccounting firm now known as Deloitte andamp; Touche.   Today, Mr. Doorley says, as part of a larger firm, Braxtonpartners can do more promotions, like sponsoring seminars andwriting books. &quot;You have to be big, or you have to be small,but you can't be in between,&quot; he says. Today, Braxton'srevenue has grown to almost $20 million, compared with lessthan $7 million in 1984.   The growing need for consultants to offer complextechnical advice is pushing the most reluctant firms intoalliances. For example, McKinsey andamp; Co. as a matter of policyhad long kept itself aloof from affiliations with othercompanies. But a little over a year ago, McKinsey changedcourse and bought Information Consulting Group, a 200-personWashington, D.C., firm specializing in informationtechnology. McKinsey said it was responding to the growingimportance of information technology in managers'decision-making.   United Research, MAC Group and Sogeti are betting that theincreased speed of corporate decision-making will mean that alinked network of consultants will succeed where individualfirms cannot. In the past, says Scott Parker, co-managingdirector of MAC, companies hired one consulting firm to planits strategy, then engaged another to help implement it.Today, he says, &quot;the markets are moving too fast for that. Ifyour product life cycle is two years, you can't use up oneyear&quot; studying the issue.   So MAC, which specializes in strategy, United Research,which helps organizations manage change, and Sogeti, whoseunits design technical systems, will pool their specialtiesto take a project from strategic planning throughimplemention.   Other earlier ventures had problems with the notion thatone type of firm could sell another's services. Back in 1970,Citicorp acquired consultants Cresap, McCormick andamp; Paget.&quot;They went into it thinking they could cross-sell,&quot; saysRodman Drake, who was a young Cresap consultant at the timeand who recently retired as Cresap's chairman. It didn'twork, he said, partly because the economies of the businesseswere so different. &quot;A corporate lending officer could makemore money for the bank in 10 minutes than Cresap could makein a year.&quot;   In 1977, Citicorp sold Cresap back to its partners; later,Cresap was sold to consultants Towers Perrin.   But most observers say most failed mergers founder on thepeople factor. &quot;We don't make telephones or ashtrays orproducts you can focus on, &quot; says William Atkins, who runsthe information-technology consulting practice at Deloitte andamp;Touche. &quot;When you are dealing with people, your inventorywalks out every night.&quot;   MAC, United Research and Sogeti did &quot;a lot ofsoul-searching&quot; before deciding to combine, says Mr. Parkerat MAC. And Sogeti, for its part, pledges not to burden thepartnership with bureaucracy. Says Sogeti's Mr. Jalabert:&quot;The only way to have people stay is if they love their job.&quot;   There are still many consultants who believe that the bestowner is no owner at all. Despite a call &quot;every four or fivemonths&quot; from a potential buyer, Dan Ciampa, president of Rathandamp; Strong Inc., a Lexington, Mass., consulting firm, says hevalues his independence. &quot;I can't think of anything moredepressing than every Dec. 10 having to go down to corporatewith a profit plan under my arm.&quot;   Still, Temple Barker's Mr. Sloane says the new competitivemarket for consultants has changed his idea of whatindependence is. After being acquired by Marsh andamp; McLennan,&quot;in most important respects, we have gained our independence:an ability to compete, to pursue strategy, and to gainclients.&quot;   ---                    Getting Together                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1989                                                                                                        Ernst andamp; Whinney          Arthur Young Touche Ross              Deloitte, Haskins andamp; Sells McKinsey andamp; Co.
