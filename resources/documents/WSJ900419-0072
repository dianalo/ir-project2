The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.9%, or 3.90, to 431.52.Declining stocks led advancers, 1,119 to 787, and 134 issuestraded at new lows compared with 102 reaching new highs.Volume was 149.7 million shares, up from 136.4 million.</LP><TEXT>   Despite the day's fall, PaineWebber's head of OTC trading,Richard Bruno, called the decline &quot;an orderly sell-off in amarket that's reacting to inflation fears.&quot; He added: &quot;I seea broad buying interest in this market that I don't thinkwill be swept away by one down day.&quot;   However, there aren't many buyers for shares of small- tomid-sized companies, said Walter Carucci, president of CarrSecurities, a wholesale market maker whose customers arebrokers and dealers trading largely in stocks of that size.   &quot;There's a definite stratifying of the market,&quot; Mr.Carucci said. &quot;It's very reminiscent of the mid-1970s, wherewell-known stocks performed magnificently and the rest of theuniverse did badly.&quot; However, that lack of demand should makethose shares attractive in six months or so, Mr. Caruccisaid. &quot;I'm beginning to see some real values in terms ofinherit asset value and underlying fundamental value.&quot;   MCI Communications, which reported first-quarter earnings,dominated the day's trading, falling 1 5/8 to 35 1/8 onnearly 6.5 million shares. Although the earnings were in linewith analysts' expectations, some investors expressed concernabout the long distance carrier's near-term outlook aftercompany officials held a morning conference call withportfolio analysts.   However, two analysts -- Jack Grubman of PaineWebber andJoel D. Gross of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette -- said theywere puzzled by investors' reaction to the conversation withMCI's chief financial officer, Daniel F. Akerson. Bothanalysts said they weren't surprised by his indications thatsecond quarter earnings will be 64 to 68 cents a share,compared with 62 cents reported yesterday for the firstquarter.   Mr. Grubman, who expects MCI's earnings to grow at about20% a year over the next few years, said that some &quot;go-go&quot;fund managers who invest in companies with very high growthrates are scaling back their MCI positions. He suggests thatfor the next few months, MCI's investor base will &quot;be inlimbo&quot; as it shifts to more traditional money managerslooking for large, high-quality companies with solid growthrates from more aggressive funds looking for more rapidgrowth.   Stocks continued to trade on earnings and earningsforecasts. &quot;We're starting to see people buy on good news andsell on bad news, like they did years ago before all thetakeover and arbitrage frenzy,&quot; said Jerry Markowitz, partnerin charge of OTC trading at Montgomery Securities in SanFrancisco.   Microsoft, which reported strong earnings late Tuesday,fell 1 3/8 to 60 5/8 on profit-taking. Merrill Lynch analystMelinda H. Reach reduced her investment opinion on thesoftware maker to an &quot;attractive&quot; rating from the firm's top&quot;buy&quot; rating, according to another person at Merrill.   Also active was Apple Computer, unchanged at 43 1/4 on 1.7million shares. After the close, the computer maker reportedsecond-quarter earnings rose to $1.04 a share from 44 cents ayear before. Mr. Bruno of PaineWebber said he expects to seestrong demand for Apple's shares this morning.   Other technology issues up on encouraging earnings wereAST Research, up 2 to 23 1/4, Pyramid Technology, up 2 1/2 to32 and Linear Technology, up 3/4 to 10 3/8.   Bogert Oil spurted 2 3/8 to 12 1/8, a 24.7% gain, afterthe Oklahoma City company announced it's in talks to beacquired for $13.20 a share by a subsidiary of Louis DreyfusEnergy Corp.   Among the day's most active shares was a new issue,Sullivan Dental Products, a marketer of dental supplies andequipment based in West Allis, Wis. An initial publicoffering of one million shares was priced at $10 each throughDain Bosworth. More than 1.2 million shares traded, closingup 2 7/8 at 12 7/8.   Exide Electronics topped the day's percentage losers,falling 2 1/2 to 8 1/4, or 23.26%, after a jury awarded about$14.9 million in damages to a plaintiff charging the maker ofpower supply products failed to pay certain salescommissions. The Raleigh, N.C., company said it will appealthe verdict.   Neutrogena slid 2 5/8 to 19 1/2 after announcing lateTuesday that it expects net income for the second quarterending April 30 will be about 50% lower than a year ago.Attributing the drop to softness in the retail market, theLos Angeles-based maker of personal care products said that1990 growth will probably be flat with 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
