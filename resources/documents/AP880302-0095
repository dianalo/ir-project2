An article in the Communist party daily Trybuna Ludu saidinnocent people were harmed merely for advocating reform, but itadded that ``the predominant majority of party and state activistshad no part in anti-Semitism.''   Addressing the 20th anniversary of the March 1968 event, the1{-page article said some conservative, nationalist party factions``took advantage of the Jewish ancestry'' of some of theirpolitical rivals.   ``Injustice was done to many people of Jewish descent as theywere removed from political and professional positions,irrespective of their views and conduct,'' the paper said.   But, it added, all the people in the conservative faction in theintra-party struggle were not anti-Semitic, and some activelydisassociated themselves from anti-Semitism.   About 9,000 Jews lost positions in the party, government,academia and other official institutions in the purge. An estimated12,000 to 20,000 Jews emigrated, the majority of the Jewishpopulation that remained after the Nazi Holocaust.   The first word that the party was going to issue a revisedhistory of the 1968 ``anti-Zionist'' purges came at the end ofJanuary in a speech by a Polish historian in Jerusalem.   Two weeks ago, the party weekly Polityka printed a chronology ofthe events with a critical introduction. But the Trybuna Luduarticle, which was reported by the state-run news agency PAP andtelevision, has the authority of an official party statement.   Speaking more generally about the persecution of liberals at thetime, the party paper said, ``Identification of the pro-reformatorymovement with revisionist and anti-socialist movements was amistake on the part of the leadership.''   It said the party leadership failed to make contact with theleading intellectuals who made ``rational proposals ofdemocratization and who sought a dialogue with the authorities''while recognizing the authority of the party.   Discrimination against Jews, in the guise ``anti-Zionism,''began after Israel's victory in the June 1967 Middle East war. Butit accelerated sharply in 1968.   Before World War II, Poland was home to more than 3.5 millionJews _ more than half the world's Jewry. There are now believed tobe between 7,000 and 15,000 Jews, with not a rabbi among them.   ``All the obscenities of the March (1968) propaganda campaignhave been repeated, all of them,'' said Adam Michnik, a prominentopposition activist and historian who was a student leader in 1968and a chief target of anti-Semitic attacks.   ``What has been done is nothing but cosmetics,'' he said in atelephone interview.   A leading party theoretician and journalist, Ludwik Krasucki,said on Polish television Tuesday that the party's attempts toreconsider the history of the period were vital.   He expressed hope that with a thorough re-examination of theperiod, in all its aspects, ``this chapter, which neverthelesscan't be forgotten, shall once and for all be closed.''</TEXT></DOC>
