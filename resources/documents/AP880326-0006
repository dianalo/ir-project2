North and John M. Poindexter will be acquitted of chargesin the Iran-Contra affair.   In off-the-cuff remarks Friday, Reagan called the affair ``theso-called scandal'' and said he still considers North ``a hero.''But he refused to say whether he was considering granting anypardons in the case.   ``I just have to believe that they're going to be found innocentbecause I don't think they were guilty of any lawbreaking or anycrime,'' Reagan said in response to a question at a seminarsponsored by the Center for the Study of the Presidency.   North and Poindexter, along with arms dealers Richard V. Secordand Albert A. Hakim, pleaded innocent Thursday to charges ofconspiracy, theft and fraud in the Iran-Contra case. The caseinvolved the sale of U.S. arms to Iran and the diversion ofproceeds to the Nicaraguan Contras.   Senate Majority Whip Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said Reagan'scomment about the innocence or guilt of people under criminalindictment ``is highly inappropriate.''   ``His statement could adversely and improperly influence theexecution of justice,'' Cranston told reporters on Capitol Hill.   ``President Reagan has contributed to a prejudicial climatewhich could make it extremely difficult to get an unbiased jury inthese cases,'' he said. ``The president has made a judgment aboutguilt or innocence which only a jury is supposed to decide underour system of justice.''   Professor John F. Banzhaf III of George Washington UniversityLaw School, called Reagan's remarks ``highly inappropriate'' andsaid they could influence jurors in the case.   ``Millions of people feel strongly in favor of the president andhis views carry great weight. He has an awful lot of credibility,''said Banzhaf, a consumer advocate who has been associated withliberal causes. ``This is prejudging the case.''   In 1970, defense lawyers unsuccessfully sought dismissal ofmurder charges against Charles Manson after then-President RichardM. Nixon said Manson ``was guilty directly or indirectly of eightmurders without reason.''   Nixon subsequently issued a statement saying he had not intendedto proclaim Manson guilty, and that a person was presumed innocentuntil proven otherwise.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, questioned aboutReagan's remarks, said, ``He's a man who tells you what he thinksand that's what he thinks.'' He said the president was ``a man ofrare insight and perception, just giving his perception there.''   White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker described thepresident's remarks as ``personal views,'' and said the president's``official position is that the system must operate.''   Reagan said that when he learned that proceeds from the armssales to Iran had been channeled to the Contra cause, he had topaides brief congressional leaders and appointed a commission toprobe the matter. Reagan also noted that he had sought theappointment of a special counsel to investigate the diversion.   ``Now, that's the whole extent of the so-called scandal,'' hesaid. ``What our intent was and what happened. And you knowsomething? After all the investigations, today I still don't knowwho got that extra money or where it came from. I'm hoping to findout.''   ``But I wanted you to know that I have some definite reason forstill thinking Ollie North is a hero,'' he added.   Reagan previously had said he did not think any laws were brokenin the Iran-Contra affair, but had never gone so far as to predictacquittals.</TEXT></DOC>
