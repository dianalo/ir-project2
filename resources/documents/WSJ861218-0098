As previously reported, Pullman, which recently asked to see Joy's books, would have had to have signed a two-year standstill agreement. The agreement would have prohibited Pullman from continuing with its $31-a-share, or $527 million, tender offer or from launching a proxy fight for control of Joy.    But a Joy spokeswoman said that in allowing Pullman access to its books, Joy was forgoing the standstill agreement. The company wouldn't elaborate.    Joy's board last week rejected Pullman's offer and said it was considering selling the company, possibly through a leveraged buyout. In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company.    Pullman, a Princeton, N.J.-based supplier of material-handling and food-service equipment, recently paid about $18 million for 750,000 Joy shares, which represent a 4.2% stake in the maker of oil field and mining equipment. The tender offer for Joy's remaining 17 million shares began Dec. 2 and is scheduled to expire Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EST, unless extended.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Joy closed at $30.625, up 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
