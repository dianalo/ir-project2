The new target compares with actual growth of 6.7 percent lastyear when exports, the engine of South Korea's economic growth,were sluggish.   The country's economy grew at an annual average rate of 12.7percent between 1986 and 1988, when exports jumped by more than 20percent annually.   The new goal was contained in the economic plan for the secondhalf of this year that was adopted Tuesday in a meeting of economicministers.   Officials at the Economic Planning Board said the upwardrevision was prompted by a better-than-expected economicperformance in the first half and an anticipated export recovery inthe latter half.   The plan said the gross national product was estimated to havegrown at a rate of 9.2 percent in the first half, mainly spurred bystrong private consumption and booming construction business.   According to the plan, South Korea is expected to post a currentaccount deficit of $1 billion this year, its first shortfall infive years. The government previously had projected a surplus of $2billion for the year.   Officials said the economic management plan calls for holdingdown annual price inflation to 9 percent by cooling down overheateddomestic consumption and curbing hotel, leisure and otherunnecessary construction projects.   Korean consumer prices have gone up an estimated 7 percent sofar this year, fueled by excessive demands for constructionmaterials connected with a boom in real estate and excessiveprivate consumption.   The annual inflation rate stood at 5.7 percent last year andaveragd 3.8 percent in the preceding seven years. A governmentthink tank predicted two weeks ago that prices would rise 13percent this year.   The government plans to peg this year's total money supplygrowth at 19 percent to contain inflation, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
