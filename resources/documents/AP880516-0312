Senior officials of the group said Monday they do not expect anydramatic breakthroughs such as occurred last year, when theministers decided to measure costly subsidies to farmers as a firststep to eliminating them.   ``The present situation does not give reason for a spectacularshift or reversal of policies,'' said one of the officials whospoke at a press briefing on the understanding they would not benamed.   The officials were alluding to the U.S. presidential electionsin November, which rule out any major policy iniatives before then,as well as continuing differences among the seven majorindustrialized countries over monetary policy.   In Britain, there is even disagreement between Prime MinisterMargeret Thatcher and her finance minister over exchange ratepolicy. There has just been a change of governments in France andWest German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's position has been weakened.   Sometimes referred to as the ``rich countries club,'' the OECDgroups the 24 main industrialized nations and focuses on economicissues. For the Group of Seven main democracies, the OECD meetingwill serve as a dress rehearsal for next's month world economicsummit in Ottawa.   On trade, the officials said the current round of Uruguaynegotations was entering its most difficult phase.   They urged nations involved to settle their differences now andtry to give the talks a new political impetus rather than waituntil a ministerial review of the talks scheduled for Montreal inDecember.   At the OECD meeting, European nations are expected to seek acommitment from the United States to reduce what they regard ashostile trade practices before they will consider taking moreaction on eliminating farm subsidies.   ``Trade and agriculture are two areas of contention where therecould be some fireworks,'' the officials said.   The officials said they hoped for free-wheeling discussions onhow to deal with the ``four dragons'' in southeast Asia: Taiwan,Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.   They expect the end result to be instructions to the secretariatto begin informal talks with these nations and others known asnewly industrialized countries, or NICs. They said they would notbe opposed to the NICs eventually joining OECD.   These countries' mounting trade surpluses are expected to exceedJapan's next year and pose a threat to reducing the U.S. tradedeficit. The effort to seek a dialogue with the NICs contrasts withthe previous practice of lecturing them on what they should do.</TEXT></DOC>
