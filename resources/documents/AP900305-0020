His name is Dmitri Hvorostovksy, and at his U.S. debut recitalSunday night, he showed that much of the excitement is justified.   Hre is a voice of splendor, supple and powerful at the sametime, tinged with a dark, mellow beauty over virtually the entirebaritone range. His only discernible weakness is in the veryhighest register, around G, where he sounds less secure. He alsohas phenomonenal breath control, giving him the ability to singlong phrases without gulping for air.   For his program, Hvorostovksy chose all Russian songs, halfTchaikovsky and half Rachmaninov. No doubt he felt most at home inthis repertoire; still, more variety would have been welcome _ toomany of the songs were slow, mournful lamentations over hopelesslove or worldly misfortune.   But there were striking moments and some first-rateinterpretations: Tchaikovsky's familiar ``None but the lonelyheart,'' was nicely restrained; the same composer's ``Don Juan'sSerenade'' had a streak of cruelty as well as bravado. AndRachmaninov's ``Christ is risen!'' seemed deeply felt in its cry ofanguish.   The real revelation came at the end, when Hvorostovksy performedthree operatic arias as encores: one from Rachmaninov's ``Aleppo,''and one each from Verdi's ``Un ballo in maschera'' and ``DonCarlo.''   Here, the young Siberian's voice rang out with a thrilling,hall-filling grandeur that prompted wild cheering from the capacityaudience at Alice Tully Hall.   Hvorostovsky, who grew up and studied in the city ofKrasnoyarsk, first came to international attention last June whenhe won the Young Singer of the World competition in Cardiff, Wales.Tapes of the BBC telecast of his performance there have circulatedwidely _ winning him admiration for both his voice and his matineeidol looks.   Before returning to Europe, Hvorostovsky will repeat Sunday'sprogram in Washington on March 10. He has signed a recordingcontract with Philips and is rapidly getting booked up byorchestras and opera companies.   One hopes he won't take things too fast _ 27 is still veryyoung, and his voice surely cannot have reached its fulldevelopment.   But if he gets the right coaching and management, one can easilyimagine that a few years from now he will virtually own the greatbaritone roles on record and on stage.</TEXT></DOC>
