In a joint news conference with British Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher, whom he met Friday for a day of talks,President Bush sounded his oft-repeated call for negotiationsover the republic's drive to break from the Soviet Union.</LP><TEXT>   On Friday, Soviet leaders seemed to step up their threatsagainst the republic. In a letter to Lithuania's president,Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev vowed to block shipments ofunspecified &quot;essential&quot; goods within 48 hours if the republicdidn't halt its independence moves. It is believed Mr.Gorbachev was referring to such goods as oil, natural gas andcoal, which are readily converted into hard currency.   (As Moscow's deadline for concessions from Lithuania wentunheeded yesterday, the Kremlin warned Washington againstrisking a return to Cold War tensions over Lithuania'sindependence claim.)   Calling reports of the Gorbachev letter to Lithuania'sleaders &quot;deeply disturbing,&quot; Mr. Bush said on Friday that&quot;now is no time for escalation; it's time for talk.&quot; Butasked what steps the U.S. would take if the sanctions wereimposed, Mr. Bush said he didn't have enough informationabout the specifics of the Soviet threat to respond.   Prime Minister Thatcher used somewhat stronger language,saying that while she wasn't &quot;lecturing&quot; Mr. Gorbachev, shewas entitled to express a view, and that &quot;this isn't aproblem that should be solved by force and which cannot besolved by force.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
