Boston? The Massachusetts capital has 39 million square feet ofoffice space downtown. In the Dallas area alone, almost an equalamount of office space is empty, according to Cushman andamp; Wakefield, areal estate research firm.   Much of that real estate is now foreclosed and owned by thestate's savings and loans, and the dead space remains one of thebiggest problems for the nation's struggling thrift industry.   Despite last year's rescue of nearly one-third of Texas' thrifts,the savings and loan business won't rebound, experts say, until thestate's economy recovers and tenants start to fill up all thoseempty, money-guzzling buildings.   It could take years.   ``Unfortunately, their (Sandamp;Ls) greatest exposure is to the weakestsegment of the Texas economy,'' said Alex Sheshunoff, an Austin,Texas, banking expert. ``It's a bit of a spiral.''   Half the repossessed assets now owned by the nation's Sandamp;Ls is inthe Lone Star state. Texas savings and loans own so much repossessedreal estate _ nearly $13 billion worth _ they literally can't giveit all away.   Texas got the nation into the Sandamp;L mess, and Texas has continuedto make it worse. The thrift industry lost $8.8 billion in the firstnine months of 1988, and $8.3 billion of that was lost in Texas.   Of the $38.2 billion spent last year by regulators to clean upthe colossal mess, $25.2 billion was spent in Texas.   Yet after closing or merging 88 insolvent Texas Sandamp;Ls last year _nearly a third of all the Sandamp;Ls in the state _ there are still 65 to70 that regulators haven't gotten to yet.   ``The ones that have the most notoriety as far as the fraud havebeen addressed,'' said George Barclay, president of the Federal HomeLoan Bank of Dallas. ``But it's a moving target...Are there more(insolvents) coming on stream? Yeah, there probably will beadditional ones, but they'll be smaller.''   Barclay, one of the architects of the Federal Home Loan BankBoard's ``Southwest Plan,'' says that most of the remaining largeTexas insolvent thrifts will be dealt with by summer, that losseswill begin to end this year, and that regulators are making progressand have the situation under control.   That still doesn't mean the thrift crisis is over in Texas,however. There are other areas of concern:   _ Despite reports of widespread fraud that contributed billionsof dollars to the Sandamp;L crisis, only a handful of Sandamp;L officials havebeen indicted. The Justice Department has assembled a huge taskforce in Dallas, which has been at work more than one year.   _ The Texas economy, which crashed with the oil-market collapse,remains sluggish, dashing dreams of a quick turnaround that wouldabsorb many of the thrift problems. Should the economy dive againwith a new crash in oil prices, the cost of the thrift cleanup wouldgrow again.   _ New owners of Sandamp;Ls have brought with them $1.1 billion in freshcapital, something regulators say is an accomplishment. But someeconomists say that's just a drop in the bucket, and not enough toreturn the state and the industry to solid footing.   At the heart of the thrift crisis in Texas is the bank board'soften criticized ``Southwest Plan,'' which merges sick institutionsinto healthier ones rather than liquidating.   It was created with a premise that the government just couldn'tdump all the dead real estate in Texas _ that it would have to waitfor the economy to recover and absorb the vacant space.   Now it's almost a Catch-22 situation: The Sandamp;Ls need the economyto recover, but the economy remains sluggish because of the Sandamp;Lrelated problems, economists say.   ``The ultimate question is how fast does Texas come back if itdoes come back,'' said Salomon Brothers Inc. real estate analyst BobHopkins.   The Lone Star state's battered economy has begun growing againslowly, but it's not keeping up with the rest of the nation.   ``It's going to be awhile before we have growth consistent withthe rest of the U.S.,'' said William Gruben, a senior economist atthe Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas.   Construction has come to a near standstill because of theoversupply of office buildings and homes. And banks and Sandamp;Ls arehesitant to lend money these days to anyone but the safest ofcustomers, making it tough for new businesses to get started.   ``Lenders at virtually every financial institution are runningscared,'' Sheshunoff said. ``The reality on the Texas economy isthat the Texas economy is going to come back one job at a time.''   And if the economy doesn't cooperate with the regulators, thecost for the Sandamp;L cleanup will undoubtedly rise.   ``If the economic environment deteriorates further, if the valueof real estate, rather than coming back or stabilizing, goes down,or if interest rates go up dramatically, that cost will go up,''Barclay said.   How the Sandamp;L crisis came about is a story of part crime and partcircumstance. It was triggered by the downfall of the Southwesteconomy, but it was exaggerated by the high-flying antics ofentrepreneurs, primarily in Texas, who, either through fraud,mismanagement or bad decisions, created billion-dollar messes.   At the same time, regulators had only skeletal forces in Texas,and weren't keeping up.   So widespread were Sandamp;L shenanigans across Dallas that the JusticeDepartment task force reportedly subpoenaed the records of hundredsof people.   The task force, which occupies an entire floor of a federalbuilding in Dallas, has grown to 58, including 25 FBI agents, saidRichard M. Fishkin, an agent with the fraud section of JusticeDepartment.   So far, 33 people have been indicted and 20 convicted. Fourtrials are pending. But the major players in what has been describedas looting of thrifts, remain under investigation.   ``These cases are complex and it takes a long time to accumulateevidence and put the cases together,'' Fishkin said.   Meanwhile, regulators have beefed up their examination forces inTexas, both to prevent a recurrence of the disasters of the mid-80s,and watch over their Southwest Plan creations.   In the last five years, the Southwest regional regulatory bank,which moved from Little Rock, Ark., to Dallas in 1983, has grownfrom 92 examiners and supervisors with a $5 million budget to 450professionals with a $33 million budget.   This year, another 123 examiners and analysts will be added,Barclay said, with another $11.5 million for the budget.   ``We see an awesome responsibility to make sure that the mergerswe're putting together work,'' Barclay said.   ``Everybody always learns from their experience. What happenedhere in '83, '84, and '85 when the regulatory process wasn't up tosnuff, won't happen again,'' Barclay said. ``If anything, we mayeven be overreacting.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Tuesday, Feb. 7</NOTE></DOC>
