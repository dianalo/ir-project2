Thetrouble began when the library tried to bar a homeless manwhose behavior disturbed other library patrons --particularly women.   The man in question had, it seems, a propensity forstaring persistently at women trying to use the reading roomand for following them around the premises. Library spokesmenexplain that in addition to this none too subtleintimidation, Richard Kreimer's body odor and lack of hygieneseriously disturbed other people trying to use the readingroom. The Free Public Library of Morristown as a resultadopted rules that barred entry to anyone creating these andsimilar nuisances.</LP><TEXT>   Enter Judge H. Lee Sarokin, of the Federal District Courtin Newark, who has now ruled that the library's policyviolates Mr. Kreimer's First Amendment rights -- a decisionthat Mr. Kreimer's lawyer described as &quot;novel.&quot; Judge Sarokindeemed the library's regulations unconstitutional on thegrounds -- among others -- that they violated Mr. Kreimer'sFirst Amendment &quot;right to receive ideas.&quot;   In a decision ascending to ever-loftier moral planes,Judge Sarokin opined that those who wanted to shield theireyes and noses from the homeless should &quot;revoke theircondition, not their library cards.&quot; What the judge did notsay was just how society could go about remedying Mr.Kreimer's condition.   Mr. Kreimer, who has free legal counsel and is busy filingnumerous lawsuits against Morristown officials, refuses thejobs offered him. He has explained, further, that it is hisright not to work.   In Judge Sarokin's view, apparently, homelessness is sosacrosanct a condition that to be designated as such isenough to exempt the homeless citizen from the rules ofconduct required of everyone else -- among them theobligation not to harass and disturb other people. In thisview moreover -- one clearly shared by the civil libertarianswho have flocked to Mr. Kreimer's side -- a homeless person'sright to offend and disturb takes precedence over the rightsof society at large.   This double standard may explain the peculiar tolerationbeing extended to Mr. Kreimer, despite the charges concerninghis annoyance of women library patrons. When a collegeprofessor or business executive looks at a woman in a way sheconsiders disturbing, he nowadays may be subject toreprimands, departmental hearings, threats to his job andstatus, and accusations of sexual harassment. Mr. Kreimer, onthe other hand, has been treated as a hero, embraced by thepolitically correct who have apparently decided thatharassing women is acceptable so long as the harasser ishomeless.   Evidently taking the position that all things are a matterof taste -- including the response to rank body odors, JudgeSarokin observes, in his decision, that &quot;one person's hayfever is another person's ambrosia.&quot; There is precedent ofcourse for the departures from common sense and reasonevident in this decision.   In a 1972 ruling against vagrancy laws, for example,Justice William Douglas took the highly romantic view thatvagrants were dissenters and nonconformists and went so faras to compare them with Walt Whitman and Vachel Lindsay,those troubadors of the open road. Justice Douglas was at thetime not privileged to look upon the sights such attitudeswould help breed -- the sort, for example, that greetvisitors to our bus stations and subways and streets, wherethese &quot;dissenters and nonconformists&quot; roam in squalor andmisery.   Not for nothing has this saga of the courts vs. a smallsuburban library made international news. The story touches araw nerve precisely because it is so familiar -- because itis in its folly-drenched fashion a perfect exemplar of theway that judges and civil libertarians go about the businessof sacrificing the public good in the interest of some highermorality.</TEXT></DOC>
