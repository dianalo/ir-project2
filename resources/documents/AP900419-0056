The 88 new launchers, 36 of which were to be controlled by theUnited States and the others by West Germany, Britain and theNetherlands, were designed for targeting on East Germany.   The tentative U.S. goal was to begin deploying them in 1995 toreplace the current mixture of nuclear-armed and conventional Lancemissiles.   But East Germany is rapidly moving out of the Soviet sphere andpreparing for union with West Germany. It is no longer perceived asa threat to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries.   The current arsenal of Lances will remain in West Germany,however. Those with nuclear warheads have a range of about 75miles, and the non-nuclear weapons are designed to hit targetswithin 45 miles.   The new launchers were intended to have a greater range of about280 miles, just below the level of intermediate-range nuclearmissiles that were banned in a U.S.-Soviet treaty in 1987.   ``The present system is a viable deterrent through the year2,000, even though the Army would have liked to start deployment ofnew Lances in 1995,'' a U.S. official said.   The current Lances recently were touched up with new fuel fortheir rockets, the replacement of worn-out components and othermaintenance.</TEXT></DOC>
