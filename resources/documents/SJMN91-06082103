If you've read the latest statistics on violent crime inAmerica, you realize how hollow these pronouncements are in the face of thefrightening reality.;    Are we to believe that our kinder and gentler nation,one able to put a man on the moon and a heart into a human being, is simplyincapable of identifying and eradicating the sources of crime within ourmidst? The plain and simple truth is that we do know what social forces areresponsible for crime and we obstinately refuse to remedy them.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  REDUCE CRIME? WE COULD BUT WE WON'T  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Silver Pen AwardLetters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     We know that guns are involved in most murders and make possible manythefts, yet we have state and federal legislators who balk at meaningfulgun-control legislation.;    We know that poverty increases the pressure tocommit property crimes, and that crimes to obtain property account for about90 percent of the crime rate, and yet we find ourselves at a loss to improvethe impoverished conditions of our inner-city neighborhoods or to improve,much less avoid further impeding the education system that will make or breakthe generations to come.;    We know that the brutality and inhumanity of ourjails and prisons undermine human dignity and actually create more criminalsthan they'll ever rehabilitate.;    We also know that the ex-con stigmaprevents a complete re-assimilation into society, and yet we do little toimprove these conditions beyond shaking our heads over the fact that so muchcrime is committed by recidivists. Eighty percent of the people incarceratedin this country have been there before.;    We know that heroin and cocaineaddicts will steal and even kill to support their habits because of the highprices of these illicit substances, and yet we cannot even conceive of asociety in which these drugs would be legal and in which addicts would be freeto sentence themselves to the prison of addiction.;    The point is thatAmericans might not know how to eliminate crime completely, but we have somepretty good ideas on how to greatly reduce both crime and the suffering itcauses.;    Our tragic flaw isn't ignorance. It's indifference.;    -- CharlesF.
