L. 94-163, 89 Stat. 917,as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, Pub. L. 95-619,the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100-12,92 Stat. 3266, and the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendmentsof 1988, Pub. L. 100-357, which requires the Department of Energy (DOE)to prescribe standardized test procedures to measure the energy consumptionof certain consumer products, including furnaces. The intent of the testprocedures is to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption thatwill assist consumers in making purchase decisions. These test proceduresappear at 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B.The Department of Energy amended the test procedure regulations by addingandSection; 430.27 on September 26, 1980, creating the waiver process. 45FR 64108. DOE further amended the Department's appliance test procedurewaiver process to allow the Assistant Secretary for Conservation and RenewableEnergy to grant an interim waiver from test procedure requirements to manufacturersthat have petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed product test procedures.51 FR 42823, November 26, 1986.The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary of Conservation and RenewableEnergy to waive temporarily test procedures for a particular basic modelwhen a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one or more designcharacteristics which prevent testing of the basic model according to theprescribed test procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluatethe basic model in a manner so unrepresentative of its true energy consumptioncharacteristcs as to provide materially inadequate comparative data. 45FR 64108 (September 26, 1980).Pursuant to andSection; 430.27(1), the Department shall publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice of each waiver granted, and any limitingconditions of each waiver.Rheem Manufacturing Company (Rheem), filed a ``Petition for Waiver'' inaccordance with andSection; 430.27 of 10 CFR Part 430. DOE published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> Rheem's petition and solicited comments, data,and information respecting the petition. 53 FR 25535 (July 7, 1988). Onecomment was received, from Teledyne Laars, which supported granting thewaiver to Rheem.DOE consulted with the Federal Trade Commission on October 7, 1988 concerningthe Rheem Petition.<ITAG tagnum="84">Assertions and Determinations </ITAG>Rheem's petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that requirea 1.5 minute time delay between the ignition of the burner and the startingof the circulating air blower. Instead, Rheem requests the allowance totest using a 30 second blower time delay when testing its (^) GEB and (^)GKA condensing gas furnaces. Rheem states that since the 30 second delayis indicative of how the (^) GEB and (^) GKA models actually operate andsince such a delay results in an energy savings of approximately 1.8 percent,the waiver should be granted. Since the blower controls incorporated on the Rheem condensing furnacesare designed to impose a 30 second blower delay in every instance of startup, and since the current test provisions do not specifically address thistype of control, DOE agrees that a waiver should be granted to allow the30 second blower time delay when testing the Rheem (^) GEB and (^) GKAcondensing furnaces. Accordingly, with regard to testing the Rheem (^)GEB and (^) GKA condensing furnaces, today's Decision and Order exemptsRheem from the existing provisions regarding blower controls and allowstesting with the 30 second delay. It is therefore ordered that: (1) The ``Petition for Waiver'' filed by Rheem Manufacturing Company (F-016),is hereby granted as set forth in paragraph (2) below, subject to the provisionsof paragraph (3) and (4). (2) Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of Appendix N of 10 CFR Part430, Subpart B, Rheem Manufacturing Company shall be permitted to testits (^) GEB and (^) GKA condensing gas furnaces on the basis of the testprocedure specified in 10 CFR Part 430, with the modification set forthbelow: (i) 3.0 Test procedure. Testing and measurements shall be as specifiedin section 9 of ANSI/ASHARE 103-1982 with the inclusion of the followingprocedures in lieu of section 9.3.1 of ANSI/ASHARE 103-1982. Gas- and Oil-Fueled Central Furnaces. After equilibrium conditions areachieved following the cool down test and the required measurements performed,turn on the furnaces and measure the flue gas temperature, using the thermocouplegrid described above, at 0.5 and 2.5 minutes after the main burner(s) comeson. After the burner start-up, delay the blower start-up by 1.5 minutes(t^), unless: (1) The furnace employs a single motor to drive the powerburner and the indoor air circulating blower, in which case the burnerand blower shall be started together; (2) the furnaces are designed tooperate using an unvarying delay time that is other than 1.5 minutes, inwhich case the fan control shall be permitted to start the blower; or (3)the delay time would result in the activation of a temperature safety devicewhich shuts off the burner, in which case the fan control shall be permittedto start the blower. In the latter case, if the fan control is adjustable,set it to start the blower at the highest temperature. If the fan controlis permitted to start the blower, measure time delay, (t^), using a stopwatch. Record the measured temperatures. During the heat-up test for oil-fueledfurnaces, maintain the draft in the flue pipe within andplusmin; 0.01 in.of water gauge of the manufacturers recommended on-period draft.'' (ii) With the exception of the modification set forth in subparagraphs(i) above, Rheem Manufacturing Company shall comply in all respects withthe test procedures specified in Appendix N of 10 CFR Part 430, SubpartB. (3) The waiver shall remain in effect from the date of issuance of thisorder until the Department of Energy prescribes final test procedures appropriateto the (^) GEB and (^) GKA models of condensing warm air furnaces manufacturedby Rheem Manufacturing Company. (4) This waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements, allegations,and documentary materials submitted by the applicant. This waiver may berevoked or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basisunderlying the application is incorrect. <ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, November 23, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John R.
