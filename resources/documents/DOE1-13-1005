Often operating at low reliability, in severe financialdifficulty due to inadequate tariffs, and under pressure to expand thenetwork to rural areas at the same time that they are under pressureto reduce capital outlays because of demands to reduce public-sectorspending and concerns over the ability to service foreign debt. Traditionalapproaches to electric utility planning have become inadequate in thisnew financial climate. The institutional, economic, manpower and financialdimensions of the present crisis, and their implications for nationalgovernments, donor agencies and international financial institutionsare examined. The need for a more balanced approach to planning models,for improved procedures to deal with uncertainties and for a more imaginativeapproach to non-traditional solutions is emphasized.</TEXT></DOC>
