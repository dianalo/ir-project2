Yethe often wrote his wife that the hardest thing to endure was thetreatment she received.   He wrote that he sometimes wondered ``whether any kind ofcommitment can ever be sufficient excuse for abandoning a young andinexperienced woman in a pitiless desert.''   In April 1982, Mandela and five colleagues were transferred toPollsmoor Prison in a white suburb outside Cape Town. They shared alarge cell where Mandela cultivated a vegetable garden andcomplained about the conditions. He was allowed to pursue hisstudies for an advanced law degree, which he received in early1989, and eventually began receiving uncensored newspapers andradio reports.   Mandela's communications with his wife and family wererestricted to 40-minute visits and one 500-word letter per month,monitored to make sure only family matters were discussed. On May12, 1984, Mandela and his wife were allowed to embrace for thefirst time in 22 years.   Mandela was born July 18, 1918, the son of a tribal chief, andreceived a relatively privileged upbringing in Transkei, a Xhosahomeland the government has declared an independent republic. Heattended Methodist schools and was admitted to the black Universityof Fort Hare in 1938, but was expelled in 1940 for leading astudent strike with Oliver Tambo, now the ANC's exiled president.   To avoid an arranged tribal marriage, Mandela fled toJohannesburg, where he worked as a policeman at a gold mine, as alaw clerk, and for a real estate agency run by Walter Sisulu, laterto be imprisoned with him. Mandela boxed as a heavyweight andstudied law at the predominantly white University of theWitwatersrand.   He married a nurse, Evelyn Mase, who bore him two daughters andtwo sons. One daughter died in infancy and one son was killed in acar crash in 1970. The couple divorced in 1957.   Mandela, Tambo and Sisulu formed the ANC Youth League in 1944,and Mandela became its president in 1950. He was chief organizer ofthe ANC's Defiance Campaign in 1952, encouraging people to breakSouth Africa's racial separation laws.   He and Tambo formed the first black law partnership in thecountry and were charged in December 1952 under the Suppression ofCommunism Act for their part in the civil disobedience campaign. Hereceived the first of many banning orders, restricting hisactivities.   He continued to work secretly and was charged in December 1956with treason, along with 155 other South Africans of all races whohad supported the Freedom Charter, calling for a non-racialdemocracy and a socialist-based economy.   While on trial, he married social worker Winnie NomzamoMadizekela, who bore him two daughters, Zenani and Zindzi.   He helped conduct the defense in the treason trial, which endedin 1960 with acquittals for all defendants. Mandela immediatelywent underground for fear he would be rearrested and spent the next17 months as a fugitive.   After a planned two-day nationwide strike was crushed by police,he and a small group of ANC colleagues decided on military action.   ``All opportunities for peaceful agitation and struggle havebeen closed to us,'' he said. ``Africans no longer have the freedomto even stay peacefully in their houses in protest against theoppressive policies of the government.''</TEXT></DOC>
