This paperindicates, for diverse types of installations (data processing centers,industrial control systems, etc.), the methods$adopted for the evaluationof disturbances due to lightning. In addition, special problems encounteredby aircraft, are also discussed. These assessments, in the context ofdesign for electromagnetic compatibility, allow the definition of minimumrequirements for diverse installations, thus assuring the implementationof adequate precautionary measures.</TEXT></DOC>
