The report addresses activitieswhich are undertaken by the US Department of Energy-Richland OperationsOffice through contractor organizations to reduce the quantity or volumeand toxicity of waste generated in support of Hanford's ongoing wastemanagement programs. To the extent possible, the waste minimization havebeen reported in quantitative terms. Although the concept and implementationof waste minimization at the Hanford Site is relatively new, substantialreductions in the amount or toxicity of certain waste types have beenachieved. As implementation of the waste disposal costs and improvementsin operational, efficiency will provide further incentives for continuedgenerator reductions. 6 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
