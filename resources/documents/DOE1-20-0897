The other effort is led bya consortium conducted research and development on Populus in physiology,ideotype development, growth modeling, genetic improvement (includingbiotechnology), and monoculture viability. In Populus, the ideal traitsemerging as important are narrow crowns with small limbs, larger upperleaves and smaller lower leaves, indeterminate growth, pest resistance,and drought tolerance. Other traits currently under investigation inthe genetic improvement projects are root architecture and fine-rootdynamics (an area of little knowledge), desirable root-symbiont relationships,leaf display for maximum light interception, photosynthesis, and dry-matterpartitioning. As knowledge of genetic variation, growth, culture, andconversion technologies advances, improvement of more specific traitswill take place.</TEXT></DOC>
