PORUBCANSKY ^Associated Press Writer</UNK><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The head of the government-controlled unionspresented a draft labor law to the legislature Wednesday, sayingSoviet workers should be allowed to strike if binding arbitrationfails, Tass reported.   Stepan Shalayev presented the law just days before the SupremeSoviet is to adjourn for the summer and a couple of weeks afterstrikes by hundreds of thousands of miners paralyzed much of theSoviet Union's coal industry.   The Supreme Soviet debate over the proposed law so soon afterthe strikes indicated that the government views labor unrest as apotentially serious problem for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev andhis reform effort.   But a leader of one Siberian coal strike committee said strikersview Shalayev and other national union officials as ``just anotherechelon of power,'' and that more strikes are likely unless theSoviet Union's social and economic situation turns around.   Soviet law in principle allows workers to strike but never hasaddressed the issue explicitly. Workers are walking off their jobsto protest low pay and bad working conditions as well asunwillingness of the official union leadership to help.   Tass said Shalayev told the Supreme Soviet the law calls forestablishing conciliation commissions to settle labor disputes andgives either side the right to appeal to an arbitration commissionset up by a local court.   It appeared from the Tass report that the law calls forpermitting strikes only when management fails to live up to anagreement or arbitration order.   The arbitration panel decision ``will be obligatory forfulfillment,'' the official news agency said.   ``If the conflicting parties still fail to settle theirdifferences, a labor collective will be given the right to use allother methods envisaged by the law, including a strike,'' Tassadded. ``However, this can be done on the decision of the majorityof the labor collective.''   The law also prohibits strikes that endanger people's lives, ordisrupt the normal life of the people or defense industries, Tasssaid.   It provided no details on what would be included in thosecategories, but if interpreted broadly they could prohibit nearlyall strikes.   Workers engaged in a legal strike will receive part of theirregular pay from management, Tass said.   Shalayev acknowledged under questioning in the Supreme Sovietthat the draft law needs amendments. But the legislature endorsedit in general and set it for publication in the official press. Alegislative debate will take place in the fall.   Tass said many Supreme Soviet deputies spoke out for expandingthe right to strike and sharply defining those industries in whichstrikes are not allowed.   Emphasizing workers' suspicion of the official unions, one ofthe coal strike leaders wrote in Wednesday's edition of the MoscowNews that the strikers regarded the unions as ``one more upperechelon of power, from which we are given orders.''   Teimuraz Avaliani, a member of the parliament and chairman ofthe strike committee in the Kemerovo region of Siberia, said: ``Weneed to create unions that are fundamentally new, maybe,alternative unions.''   ``It simply didn't enter our minds to invite Comrade Shalayev toour side, and we presented him with demands similar to otherrepresentatives of authority,'' Avaliani said.   Avaliani said the strike was not an effort to take somethingaway from somebody else, but ``the action of people who live worsethan anyone else.''</TEXT></DOC>
