The resultswere obtained by searching a number of on-line retrieval systems, downloadingthe data, and processing it using software developed by the TechnologyInformation Systems Program. Databases which were searched included PsycINFO(American Psychological Association), Compendex (Engineering Index),Inspec (Institute of Electrical Engineers), NTIS (National TechnicalInformation Service), DROLS (Department of Defense), NASA-Recon (NationalAeronautics and Space Administration), Science Citation Index (Institutefor Scientific Information), Conference Papers Index (Cambridge ScientificAbstracts), and a number of other databases which produced no retrievalresults. Those citations identified as part of the PsycINFO databasesare reprinted with permission of the American Psychological Association,publisher of Psychological abstracts and the PsycINFO database (Copyrightc 1967--1988 by the American Psychological Association), and may notbe reproduced without its prior permission. The retrieval citations werethen converted to a common format, duplicates were eliminated, and theresulting master set was sorted and formatted for printing. Indexes andvarious analyses were produced as the final step in creating this publication.The major listing is alphabetical by author and includes abstracts wherethey were available. An index to authors follows as well as several frequencylists to provide an overview of the coverage. Additional informationconcerning either the bibliography or the software used to create itmay be obtained form Hilary Burton, TIS Program, Lawrence Livermore NationalLaboratory.</TEXT></DOC>
