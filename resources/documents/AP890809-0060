(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists are hoping the microbes theytinkered with will vanish quickly after the nation's first open-airfield test of a pesticide made of genetically engineered virus.   Weather permitting, scientists from Cornell University's BoyceThompson Institute for Plant Research intended to spray the virustoday on a field of cabbage at the New York State AgriculturalExperiment Station.   The test is designed to see if a genetically disabled virus willdisappear from the environment quickly after attacking the insectsit is aimed at destroying, rather than lingering in the field, saidH. Alan Wood, the virologist who will direct the test.   ``It's a hurdle in terms of the genetic engineering of virusesand quite a significant step if it's successful,'' Wood said. ``Itwould be a big step for biological control.''   The test could provide new ways to fight plant diseases andpests while lessening dependence on pesticides. About 3 billionpounds of pesticides are used in the United States each year.   Scientists are aiming their test at the cabbage looper, a palegreen caterpillar that attacks more than a dozen kinds ofvegetables, including cabbage, beets, broccoli and cauliflower.   The virus they are using is identical to naturally occurringstrains known as baculoviruses, which can cause viral epidemics inmany agricultural and forest insect pests. Researchers will removea gene that provides a protective protein coat from the virus.   Scientists eventually hope to splice a new gene into the virus,one that would make it more deadly to pests, Wood said. The new,more virulent virus could be sprayed onto plants, where it wouldkill pests and then die quickly.   The field test will be conducted on a two-acre, doughnut-shapedplot containing 20,000 cabbage plants, of which 2,500 plants in thecenter will be sprayed with the virus.   The plot will be monitored through 1991.   The Environmental Protection Agency approved the field test inJuly after determining it posed no environmental or human healthhazards.   Several genetically altered bacteria have been tested before,but this is the first altered viral insecticide tested in thefield, said Fred Betz, a biologist at the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency.</TEXT></DOC>
