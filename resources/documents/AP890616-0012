The Chinese government's violent suppression of a student-ledreform movement has sent a shiver around the world, instilling fearin some students who had hoped to return home and hope in others whowant to stay abroad.   Since the June 3-4 military attack on unarmed students inBeijing, governments have said they would extend the visas ofChinese students. Among those are the United States, Japan, Canadaand the 12-nation European Economic Community.   In Australia, the Immigration Department said it had received10,000 inquiries from Chinese students _ virtually all of the 10,600registered in the country _ about extending their visas.   Only a few have actually applied, said immigration spokeswomanJenny Hoskin. ``But we expect a great deal more in coming weeks.''   ``We would consider sympathetically the case of any student whocould be considered in any sense in danger by returning to China,''Prime Minister Bob Hawke said Thursday, assuring students inAustralia they need not worry about their visas lapsing and beingdeported.   In Beijing, statistics show about 80,000 Chinese now are studyingabroad, with half of them in the United States, according to theReturned Student Association.   They were permitted to leave China only after passing competitiveexaminations. Rules published in 1987 said they had to show they``love the motherland and cherish socialism.'' Political reliabilityand family connections _ relatives in China to ensure their return _are important.   Abroad, many students hope to keep alive the pro-democracymovement. But distance from the tensions in China has not allayedfears of government reprisals. In several countries, students saythey believe they are being monitored and harassed by Chineseauthorities.   At Brandeis University near Boston, mathematician Cheng Mo, 26,said he suspected the Chinese government was responsible for takingdown posters after a meeting of Chinese students.   In Japan, a Chinese student who asked not to be identified saiddiplomats had photographed demonstrations outside the ChineseEmbassy in Tokyo.   ``Although they couldn't possibly identify everyone, many of usare worrying,'' he said.   Another student in Japan, also asking anonymity, saidpro-democracy activists have toned down the optimism they felt twoweeks ago.   ``It looks like the battle will be a long one,'' he said. ``Noneof us wants to do anything conspicuous. But we will continue tofight. Maybe publish a magazine or something. We won't make anyneedless sacrifices.''   Some Chinese even want to move to Taiwan, where the mainland'sold rulers fled after the communist revolution.   Taiwan's de facto embassy in Tokyo said 200 Chinese students hadpicked up applications for Taiwanese passports and 20 had submittedthem in the last four days.   In London, the Free Chinese Center, which represents the Taiwangovernment in Britain, has received several dozen applications forcitizenship ``and we expect more to come,'' said spokesman KateHanniker.   The Taiwanese government announced last week it would relax itsrules and issue Taiwan passports to Chinese students who hadpariticipated in rallies in other countries supporting thedemonstrators in Beijing.   ``This is to show our concern for overseas mainland students. Wehope our passports will help them complete their studies in foreigncountries,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Chen Yu-chu in Taipei.   But holding a Taiwan passport will not guarantee permanentresidence in Nationalist China, he said, because the country's lawssay mainland Chinese must live four years in a free country to beeligible for entrance and residence on the island.   The Taiwanese Education Ministry has proposed offering financialhelp to mainland Chinese studying in other countries.   Some of the 3,000 Chinese students in Britain have expressedworry that their financing ends this summer, said Dr. Abraham Lue,assistant principal of Kings College in London.   ``And so they are worried that if the situation in China prevailsand it's hazardous for them to return, then they're going to find itdifficult to find funding and to stay on here longer,'' he told theBBC.   Some Chinese students in the United States fear they will bejailed if they return home, said Ding Xueliang, 36, a HarvardUniversity student who was active in the democracy movement in exile.   ``We'll continue to speak out,'' Ding said. ``It could cause moretrouble, but our moral obligation is to help our friends in China.''   In Denmark, seven Chinese students and two businessmen haveapplied for asylum since the crackdown in Beijing, said IngeThomsen, a department head in the Aliens Directorate. She saidDanish authorities would be cautious in forcing any Chinese toreturn to China under the present circumstances.</TEXT></DOC>
