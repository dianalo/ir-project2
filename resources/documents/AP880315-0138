Bob Dole. Sen. Paul Simon dueled Jesse Jackson in a battle ofDemocratic favorite sons that made third place attractive to theirrivals.   In the first industrial state to vote, Massachusetts Gov.Michael Dukakis sought to leave Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and Rep.Richard Gephardt far behind.   The Illinois primaries included presidential straw polls andseparate elections of delegates to the nominating conventions nextsummer.   Bush, winner of 16 out of 17 Super Tuesday contests last week,led Dole by huge margins in the pre-election polls in the Land ofLincoln. He looked for his first primary win on Midwestern soil,and an increase in his seemingly insurmountable lead in conventiondelegates.   Kansas Sen. Dole spent the day campaigning in Wisconsin andConnecticut in a demonstration of his determination to stay thecourse _ even though he had speculated about withdrawing if hesuffered another big defeat. He said he hoped to win 40 percent ofthe delegates at stake during the day.   Pat Robertson, the former television evangelist campaigning as aconservative alternative to Bush, said he might quit if he failedto pick up 5 percent of the vote. ``I'm not Don Quixote and I'm notgoing to tilt against windmills,'' he said.   Simon was rated the slight favorite on the Democratic side as hesought a victory he said was essential to sustain his candidacy. Hecampaigned as the man to represent Illinois at the bargaining tableof what he said would be a brokered Democratic National Conventionin Atlanta.   But pre-election polls suggested Jackson's popularity amongblack voters could propel him to his first industrial-statevictory, and the Chicago-based civil rights activist forecast a``significant breakthrough.'' He voted at a South Side church inChicago.   Dukakis used a combination of personal campaigning and $250,000worth of television ads in an appeal to Simon supporters to rejectSimon's strategy of forcing a brokered nomination.   Dukakis' aides said they would be pleased if that made Jacksonthe winner, since a Simon withdrawal would eliminate a rival forwhite, liberal support in the next states to vote. Michigan,Connecticut, Wisconsin, New York and Pennsylvania all follow nextweekend's Kansas caucuses.   Simon cast a primary-day ballot in Makanda in southern Illinoisand said, ``We have to win both'' the popular vote and the delegatecontest to stay alive in the race. He said he would do both, andspokesman Terry Michael predicted the Illinois senator would pickup 135 of the 173 national convention delegates at stake.   Dukakis was locked in a close race nationally with Jackson fornational delegate superiority and hoped to establish position overthe field for the Michigan caucuses on March 26. Dukakis' campaignsaid he has a reserve of some 100 delegates won in caucuses inother states that have been held but have not yet been counted.   Going into Illinois, Dukakis had 462.5 of the 2,082 needed towin the nomination. Jackson had 423.55, Gore 352.8, Gephardt 145and Simon 35.5.   Republicans elected 82 of their 92-member delegation Tuesday.Democrats picked 113, with an additional 60 to be allocated laterat a state convention on the basis of the evening's results.   Bush began the day the prohibitive leader in the delegatecompetition on the Republican side with 705 of the 1,139 needed toclinch the nomination. Dole had 165, while Robertson had 17.   Illinois' separate delegate elections looked like an easiercontest for Simon, although Jackson was expected to virtually sweepthe competition in the predominantly black congressional districtsin Chicago.   Most of Simon's delegate candidates were well-known figureslocally, and they urged him not to drop out of the race afterearlier primary disappointments, at least partly so they could havea chance at attending the Democratic National Convention in Atlantathis summer.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
