Early diagnosis, properstaging, and follow-up evaluation should play very important roles inthe management of hepatomas. It has been stated that malignant hepatomasare usually radiogallium-avid on scintigraphy. Since early April 1987,in order to determine the value of Ga-67 scanning in hepatomas, planarand single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients withsuspected, proven, or treated hepatomas was performed at Yonsei UniversityHospital. On the basis of the preliminary study, on 20 patients thusfar, planar or SPECT gallium scintigraphy appears useful in the followingareas: (1) Hepatomas can be diagnosis early especially in cirrhotic patientson whom other imaging modalities such as US and CT are not helpful. (2)Small lesions are detected better by SPECT than by planar image. (3)Primary, daughter, and metastatic lesions are readily demonstrable. (4)Following treatment specially with I-131 lipiodol, the tumor status canbe evaluated using serial gallium scanning. Thus, gallium scanning, planaror SPECT, appears quite useful in the management of hepatomas, especiallyin the evaluation of tumor status following therapy.</TEXT></DOC>
