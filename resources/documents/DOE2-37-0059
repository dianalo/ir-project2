To whatextent these observations faithfully represent the sources rather thancharacteristics induced in propagation is therefore a question of greatinterest. Light propagation is determined by the metric of spacetimeand so is sensitive to the physical inhomogeneities that perturb theidealized smooth cosmology. The author analyzes two varieties of metricperturbation - gravitational waves and gravitational lenses - and discussessome possible methods for including their properties within a unifiedformalism dealing with light propagation through gravitationally perturbedcosmologies. In addition to investigating the astrophysical effects ofthese inhomogeneities (redshift, position, and luminosity fluctuations),he derives upper limits on the energy density in gravitational wavesby examining cosmic-microwave background anisotropies and galaxy-clusteringcorrelations. He also calculates constraints on the mass and number densityof compact (possibly dark) objects acting as gravitational lenses byexamining supernova amplification probabilities.</TEXT></DOC>
