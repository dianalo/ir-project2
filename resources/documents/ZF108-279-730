Ronald Carey, the progam manager, said the GeneralServices Administration has agreed to allow bidders flexibility in meetingRCAS communications requirements.andM;In their proposals, due April 30, bidders can propose to use the Defense DataNetwork or their own systems, Carey said.andP;  But once the contractor is named,the National Guard &quot;can compel them to use FTS 2000 as link in their systemif the service provided in FTS 2000 is the same as in their proposal,&quot; hesaid.andM;In an interview before the amendments were released, Carey said they coveredsuch topics as interfaces, maintenance credits, the compute-off, workloadanalysis requirements, warranty clauses and technology enhancements.andP;  He saidthese items did not amount to major changes in the Guard's requirements.andM;Earlier this year, as many as seven teams of contractors were expected to bidon the mammoth integration contract.andP;  The first company to withdraw was TRWInc.andM;ATandamp;T spokeswoman Edith Herman said the company's withdrawal from RCAS &quot;hadnothing to do with the FTS issue.andP;  A company has to set priorities, and ourplate is very full now with some of the major contracts we're involved with.&quot;andM;Left in the fight for the $400 million contract are Boeing Computer ServicesCo., Computer Sciences Corp. and General Dynamics Corp.andM;Electronic Data Systems Corp. is rumored to be a fourth potential bidder.andO;But Randy Dove, an EDS spokesman, declined to discuss the company's planslast week.andM;ATandamp;T's decision to withdraw from a team led by Science ApplicationsInternational Corp. left SAIC unable to continue as a prime contractor, anSAIC source said.andM;He said SAIC has reached a tentative agreement to bid with Boeing.andP;  JohnAlter, a Boeing spokesman, said the company &quot;is not yet prepared to announcewho our team members will be.&quot;andM;Two teaming arrangements are firm.andP;  General Dynamics Corp. is teamed with GTEGovernment Systems Corp., Apple Computer Inc., Digital Equipment Corp. andseveral smaller companies, said Art Melvin, a business development manager atGeneral Dynamics.andM;Officials at Computer Sciences Corp. have announced that Systems Research andApplications Co. and American Management Systems Inc. are on its team.andO;Sources have said CSC also reached an agreement with US Sprint CommunicationsCo.andM;RCAS will be developed in two stages.andP;  In the compute-off, two primes willvie for the full development contract, which may require up to 28,000microcomputers in 5,000 National Guard and Army National Guard locationsthroughout the country.andM;Several sources have said that of the remaining bidders, Boeing has investedthe most in trying to win the RCAS contract.andP;  One source said Boeing willhave spent as much as $8 million once its proposal is submitted.andM;General Dynamics' Melvin said he was not surprised that only four teams arebidding.andM;&quot;Because of the size of the program and the wherewithal required, youwouldn't expect there would be more than a few bidders.&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
