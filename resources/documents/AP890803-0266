The State Taxation Bureau will check the books and taxregistrations of private industrial, commercial and serviceenterprises in August and September for signs of tax evasion orother illegal activities, Chinese newspapers reported Wednesday.   About 70 percent to 80 percent of all private businesses evadeda total of more than $4.94 billion last year, far exceeding the$2.53 billion in tax revenue collected, the bureau said.   ``What is more serious is that a few lawbreakers attack taxcollectors and prevent them from carrying out their duties,''stated the Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily.   The inspections are intended to establish a ``clear-cut orderfor private business people to fulfill their obligations to thestate,'' said tax bureau director Jin Xin.   Jin said illegal businesses would be closed and illegal incomeconfiscated.   Private companies in China are required to pay 52 percent oftheir profits to the government as taxes and to reinvest 30 percentin business expansion, leaving only 18 percent as income for theowners, he said.   The inspections are part of an effort to more strictly regulateChina's small private sector, which is flourishing at the expenseof state-owned firms, Jin said.   At the end of last year, there were 14.5 million privatebusinesses employing more than 23 million people in China.   The government also is cracking down on corrupt tax collectors,who are prohibited from accepting gifts from tax-free andtax-reduced businesses to help ``ensure an honest and cleangovernment,'' the official Xinhua news agency said.   Employees of the tax bureau are not allowed to go on junkets orhold meetings in tourist spots, live in luxurious hotels duringinspection trips, build luxurious office buildings or apartments,host banquets or send gifts, Xinhua said.   The restrictions are part of a national anti-corruption drivetriggered by the student democracy movement that was crushed inJune after drawing hundreds of thousands of supporters with suchslogans as, ``oppose corruption.''</TEXT></DOC>
