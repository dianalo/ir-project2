(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The deaths of 10 bald eagles thatapparently ate illegally poisoned animal carcasses threaten thecomeback of the endangered birds in the Chesapeake Bay area,federal officials said.   ``While our national symbol is making a recovery, it cannotsustain this rate of loss month after month nor will we tolerateit,'' said Frank Dunkle, director of the U.S. Fish and WildlifeService.   Five dead eagles, one adult and four immature bald eagles, werefound May 3 in a field near the carcasses of three raccoons, a deerand a vulture. Five others were found elsewhere in DorchesterCounty between March 12 and May 1, including the BlackwaterNational Wildlife Refuge near Cambridge.   ``The birds are not in danger of becoming extinct'' because ofillegal poisoning of animals, but ``the deaths resulting will havesome impact on their recovery because the deaths are occurring inan area where we have a large amount of bald eagles,'' Glenn D.Therres, the non-game and endangered species program manager forthe Maryland Forest, Park and Wildlife Service.   State and federal officials said they are particularly concernedbecause the county has the greatest concentration of bald eagles inthe Chesapeake Bay area. The eagle population, devastated by theuse of the pesticide DDT in the 1950s and 1960s, had been restoredto its highest levels on the East Coast.   Officials are testing tissue from the dead eagles and thecarcasses for chemicals. Results are expected in several weeks, butbecause the eagles had been dead at least a month before they werefound, such analyses can be difficult, said Inez Connor, aspokeswoman for the Fish and Wildlife Service in Newton Corner,Mass.   ``The fact there has been a carcass near all of the eagles wehave found leads us to think that they died as a result of eatingpoisoned animals,'' Ms. Connor said. Criminal charges could bebrought against anyone found to be poisoning animals. Bald eaglesare protected under federal law.</TEXT></DOC>
