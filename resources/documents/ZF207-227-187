 Here's a guide to the paths you have available to you.andP;  BYRUSSELL ITOandM;If your idea of surrealism is trying to run FullWrite on a 1-megabyte MacPlus, you're ready for a memory upgrade.andP;  How much you'll need depends on thekind of work you do, but regardless of your  situation, one rule willdefinitely prove true: You'll neverandM;have enough.andP;   Given that fact, here's what you should know aboutandM;memory and the upgrades available to you.andP;  THINGS ARE WHAT THEY SIMMandM;In the Mac Plus and up, the Mac's temporary memory, or RAM (random accessmemory), resides in single in-line memory modules (SIMMs).andP;  They're installedon the Mac's motherboard, and since a standard 1- megabyte Mac always hasfour of them, they're pretty easy to spot.andP;  When you look at a SIMM, you'llsee a narrow circuit board about 3 inches long with eight dynamic RAM (DRAM)chips on one side and a  row of metal contacts along one of the long edges.andM;The DRAM chips can come in 256-kilobit or 1-megabit capacities, so, dependingon the type of DRAM on the SIMM, the SIMM's total memory could be 256K or 1megabyte.andP;  You can tell which you have, because the type will be embedded inthe part number on the DRAM chips.andP;  If you see the number 256 somewhere inthe part number, you've got a 256K SIMM.andP;  Unfortunately, things aren't socut-and-dried for 1- megabyte SIMMs.andP;  If you check the part number and yousee 1M, 1024, 1100, or anything similar -- but not 256 -- you're looking at a1-megabyte SIMM.andP;  (Unless you buy your SIMMs from some guy in a bus stationbathroom.)andM;However, not all SIMMs come with only eight DRAM chips.andP;  IBM- compatibleSIMMs actually have nine.andP;  You can install these in a Mac, but you'll bepaying for an extra chip that the Mac can't read, and frankly no one needssomething that does nothing -- especially at today's prices.andM;The contacts, or fingers, along the SIMM's edge look like little metal teeth,and the main thing you have to worry about is making sure they're pointing inthe right direction when you install the SIMM.andP;  If you look into a SIMMsocket, you'll see a row of springs sticking out along one edge.andP;  The SIMM'sfingers must make contact with these springs, so, when you insert the SIMM,make sure you've got it turned the right way.andP;  SLIM SIMM VERSUS THICK DIPandM;In addition to their memory capacities, SIMMs also come in two physicalsizes: surface mount, or low profile; and dual in-line package (DIP), or highprofile.andP;  Surface-mount SIMMs are generally more popular for the Plus and SE,because they take up less room inside the Mac.andP;  These SIMMs use DRAM chipsthat mount directly to the surface of the circuit board, which reduces theirbulk.andP;  And since slim is in, surface mounts are the SIMMs everyone wants, butthat also makes them more expensive.andP;  DIP SIMMs are cheaper, but because theyuse DRAM chips with leads that have to pass through the circuit board, theyalso take up more room.andP;  You can install either type in any Mac, but DIPSIMMs may get in the way if you have a Mac Plus or SE with other internallyinstalled hardware, such as accelerators or hard disks.andP;  Since the Mac II haslots of room, however, you can  save some money by buying DIP SIMMs whenupgrading it.andP;  SOCKET TO SIMMandM;To this point, we've been talking about standard SIMMs, but there is anotherconfiguration available: socketed SIMMs.andP;  Several companies offer these 256Kmodels, and they look and function just like  regular SIMMs, except thatthere's a socket on the edge opposite the  fingers.andP;  The idea is that youinsert the socketed SIMMs into the Mac motherboard, then insert the Mac'sSIMMs into the open sockets on  the expansion SIMMs.andM;Since it uses the cheaper 256K SIMMs, this piggyback method is economical,but it does have some limitations.andP;  First, socketed SIMMs may come insurface-mount or DIP versions.andP;  Depending on how much stuff you've packedinto your Mac, the DIP versions may not fit, so make sure you've got enoughroom before you buy.andP;  Second, some of these kits can't be expanded further,so even though you may have reached only half the computer's maximum RAM, youcould beandM;stuck.andP;   As always, it pays to plan ahead.andP;  Piggybacks can be anandM;economical  long- term solution, but they can just as easily turn into anexpensive stopgap.andP;  FASTER THAN SIMMandM;Just like hard disks, DRAM is rated for speed, although dealers will usuallyrefer to the SIMM, rather than the RAM chips themselves, as being rated at aparticular speed.andP;  RAM speed is listed in nanoseconds: The lower the number,the faster the SIMM, but the  speed rating isn't necessarily an absolutevalue.andP;  A SIMM's actual speed  is usually faster than the stated number --what the number tells you  is that the SIMM you're buying will be no slowerthan the reported value.andP;  For example, a 120-nanosecond SIMM may actually berunning  at 100 nanoseconds -- or even faster.andP;  The Mac Plus and SE bothrequire 150-nanosecond (or faster) SIMMs, while the Mac II requires 120-nanosecond (or faster) SIMMs.andP;  THE PLUS PLUSandM;The SIMMs in a Mac Plus are arranged in a vertical array of two pairs of twoslots each, limiting the memory expansion to a maximum of 4 megabytes.andP;  Eachof these pairs is called a row, and there are a few rules that govern them:andM;(1) All the SIMMs in a row must be of the same speed.andP;  You can, however, havediffering speeds between the rows.andM;(2) All the SIMMs in a row must be of the same size.andP;  You can't mix a1-megabyte SIMM with a 256K SIMM within a row.andM;(3) A row must be completely filled or empty -- it can't contain only oneSIMM.andM;(4) Larger SIMMs must be installed in the first row, so if you're going tomix 256K and 1-megabyte SIMMs, make sure the 1-megabyte units are in thefirst row.andM;Because rules 2 and 3 impose specific restrictions, the upgrade path for aMac Plus is as follows: 1 megabyte (the standard configuration is four 256KSIMMs), 2 megabytes (two 1-megabyte SIMMs), 2.5 megabytes (two 1-megabyteSIMMs and two 256K SIMMs), and 4 megabytes (four 1-megabyte SIMMs).andP;  Youcan't have a 3-megabyte machine.andP;  The only trick in installing SIMMs,assuming you follow the rules, is getting the Plus to recognize how muchmemory it has available.andP;  To do this, look at the resistor on the logic boardin the area labeled RAM SIZE.andP;  For a 2-megabyte machine, using two 1-megabyteSIMMs, the resistor (150 ohms) that's normally installed at R8 (labeled 256KBIT) must be moved to the socket marked R9 (labeled  ONE ROW).andP;  For a 2.5- or4-megabyte Mac Plus, it should be removed.andP;  THE SE PLUSandM;The upgrade path for an SE is identical to that for a Plus, and in fact, theSE even follows the same rules governing SIMM types, position within a row,and so on.andP;  Like the Plus, the SE's memory banks are arranged in two sets oftwo rows.andP;  But, unlike the Plus, the SE's rows are arranged and readhorizontally.andP;  As with the Plus, the resistor must be properly positioned forthe Mac to know how much  RAM it actually has.andP;  In the SE's case, thepertinent resistor is  located at R35 (256K BIT).andP;  For a 2-megabyte SE, theresistor (150 ohms) should be moved from R35 to R36 (ONE ROW).andP;  For 2.5- and4-megabyte SEs, it should be removed entirely.andP;  THE MAC II EIGHTandM;While the Mac II has twice the memory capacity of either the Plus or SE, someof the same types of rules governing memory management apply.andP;  In the Mac II,SIMMs are installed in two banks of four (Banks A and B), instead of in rowsof two.andP;  But interestingly enough, the SIMMs are numbered in pairs, so whileyou may have eight SIMMs installed, the Mac reads them as SIMMs 1 to 4.andP;  Notonly that, SIMM 1 is actually in Bank B (don't ask; I don't know why).andP;  Aswith the Plus's and SE's rows, you can't mix SIMM types within a bank.andP;  Doingso will cause the bank to default to the lowest capacity SIMM, so don'tshuffle them before installation.andM;Because the banks must either be full or empty, your choice of configurationsis this: 1 megabyte (again, the standard configuration is four 256K SIMMs), 2megabytes (eight 256K SIMMs), 4 megabytes (four 1-megabyte SIMMs), 5megabytes (four 1-megabyte and four 256K SIMMs), or 8 megabytes (eight1-megabyte SIMMs).andP;  Because of the Mac II's rule of fours, you should give alot of thought to how you want to upgrade your system before you do it.andP;  Forexample, 2 megabytes may sound like all you'll ever need.andP;  But if you choosethis route and subsequently decide to upgrade further, you'll have to sell ortrash the four additional 256K SIMMs you installed for the upgrade.andP;  The sameholds true for the 4-megabyte model; except in this case, you'd actually bepulling the SIMMs that cameandM;installed in the Mac II.andP;   For these reasons, the conventionalandM;upgrade path for a Mac II is 1, 2,  5, and 8 megabytes -- and in fact, mostusers skip right to 5  megabytes, if they can.andP;  Unlike the Plus and SE, theMac II is a plug-and-go machine -- you don't have to make any resistorchanges.andP;  MEMORY LANEandM;So now that you know what you can do, here are some things you should do.andO;Before you touch a SIMM, make sure you've discharged any static you mighthave built up from walking across the carpet or rubbing your acrylic sweaterwith a balloon.andP;  All it takes is one spark, and your precious treasure willbe turned into the computer equivalent of a pet rock.andP;  And when you'reworking on a Plus or SE, make absolutely sure you don't touch the video tubeor circuitry.andP;  Even if you've got the machine unplugged -- which youdefinitely should -- these goodies can retain enough voltage to turn you intothe equivalent of a pet rock.andP;  So be careful, and the only melting circuitboards you'll see will be in your dreams.andP;
