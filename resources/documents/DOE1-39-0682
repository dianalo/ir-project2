We show that it is possible to consider an n particlediagram like a correction to the DFF results for electronic structure,if we take into account the electron-electron interaction with non-zerotransmitted momentum q or energy {epsilon}. The model is proposed forcalculating the leading term of the self-energy expansion as a powerseries in interactions, i.e. the second order term under the conditionsq=O and {epsilon}not =O. This model is illustrated by calculating theelectronic band structure and optical properties of anti ferromagneticchromium. The self-energy correction leads to a better agreement betweenthe theoretical calculations and experimental measurements of electronicproperties. (author). 40 refs, 5 figs, 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
