These are discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicant Comments</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">A. Summary of Facts and Representatives</ITAG>The applicant has commented on or clarified certain aspects of the proposedexemption. In this regard, item 4 of the preamble to the proposed exemptionstates that certificateholders are entitled to receive monthly or quarterlyinstallments of principal and/or interest, or lease payments due on receivables.The applicant has requested that the Department clarify that the exemptionis available for the receipt of semi-annual payments by certificateholders.The applicant represents that when payments are made on this basis, fundsare not permitted to be commingled with the assets of the servicer forany period longer than would be permitted for a monthly-pay security. Asegregated account is established in the name of the trustee (on behalfof certificateholders) to hold funds received between distribution dates.The account is under the sole control of the trustee, who invests the account'sassets in short-term securities that meet rating criteria consistent withthe rating of the certificates. In some cases, the servicer may be permittedto make a single deposit in the account once a month. When the servicermakes such monthly deposits, the funds received by the servicer may becommingled with the servicer's assets during the month prior to deposit.In no event will the period of time between receipt of funds by the servicerand deposit of these funds in a segregated account exceed one month. Furthermore,in those cases where distributions are made semi-annually, the servicerwill furnish a report on the operation of the trust to the trustee on amonthly basis. At or about the time the report is delivered to the trustee,it will be made available to certificateholders and delivered to or madeavailable to the rating agency that has rated the certificates. After consideringthe applicant's comments with regard to semi-annual payments to certificateholders,the Department has concluded that the exemption is available for semi-annual(rather than monthly or quarterly) payments made to certificateholders,provided that the conditions set forth in the exemption are met.With respect to item 5, the applicant notes that in some transactions fastpay/slow pay certificates may involve certificates which have the samematurities but different payment schedules.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\Goldman Sachs also has clarified that, if a trust issuessubordinate certificates, holders of such subordinate certificates maynot share in the amount distributed on a pro rata basis. The Departmentnotes that the exemption does not provide relief for plan investment insuch subordinated certificates.Item 9 of the preamble to the proposed exemption states that the trustee'sfee is paid by the servicer. The applicant notes that in some transactionsthe servicer, sponsor, or the trust may pay the trustee for services renderedon behalf of the trust. The method of compensating the trustee will bespecified in the pooling and servicing agreement and disclosed in the prospectusor private placement memorandum relating to the offering of the certificates.Item 11 of the preamble to the proposed exemption states that in some cases,the sponsor will obtain the receivables from various originators pursuantto existing contracts with such originators under which the sponsor continuallybuys receivables. In other cases, the sponsor will purchase the receivablesat fair market value from the originator or a finance company pursuantto a purchase and sale agreement related to the specific offering of certificates.The applicant has commented that in some cases the sponsor will purchasethe receivables from other sources in the secondary market.The second paragraph of item 11 of the preamble to the proposed exemptionstates, that as compensation for the receivable transferred to the trust,the sponsor receives certificates representing the entire beneficial interestin the trust which it sells for cash to investors or securities underwriters.The applicant has clarified that in some transactions the sponsor may retaina portion of the certificates for its own account. In addition, the applicantnotes that in some transactions the originator may sell receivables toa trust for cash. At the time of the sale, the trustee would sell certificatesto the public or to underwriters and use the cash proceeds of the saleof the certificates to pay the originator for the receivables sold to thetrust.The second paragraph of item 13 states that the ``credit support fee''paid to the servicer is paid out of the payments received on the receivablesin excess of the pass-through payments made to certificateholders. Theapplicant notes that in some transactions the ``credit support fee'' ispaid in a lump sum at the time the trust is established.With respect to item 16, the applicant notes that, for some public offerings,Goldman Sachs may sell certificates on an agency basis in a best effortsunderwriting. In these cases, Goldman Sachs would receive an agency commission.The applicant further notes that in some private placements Goldman Sachsmay buy certificates as principal, in which case its fee would consistof the difference between what it receives for the certificates that itsells and what it pays the sponsor for these certificates.Item 17 of the preamble to the proposed exemption states that the poolingand servicing agreement generally provides that the servicer may purchasea receivable included in the trust when the balance payable on the receivableis reduced to a specified percentage (usually 10 percent) of the initialbalance. The applicant has clarified that the servicer may purchase thereceivables then included in the trust when the aggregate unpaid balanceon the receivables is reduced to a specified percentage (usually 5 to 10percent) of the initial aggregate unpaid balance. The applicant statesfurther that the second paragraph of item 17 should read as follows: ``Thepurchase price will be at least equal to the unpaid principal balance onthe receivable plus accrued interest, less any unreimbursed advances ofprincipal made by the servicer.''With respect to item 18 of the preamble to the proposed exemption, theapplicant states that cash flow subordination is a further example of creditsupport.Item 19 of the preamble to the proposed exemption states that where themaster servicer or its affiliate provides credit support to the trust,the master servicer, in its capacity as servicer, will first advance fundsif it determines that such advances are recoverable out of late paymentsby the obligors or amounts otherwise distributable to holders of subordinatedcertificates. Otherwise, the master servicer, as the provider of creditsupport, will be called upon to provide funds to cover such payments tothe full extent of its obligations as insurer. The applicant notes thatthe arrangement described in item 19 is the typical arrangement. However,the applicant further notes that in some transactions the master servicermay not be obligated to advance funds, but instead would be called uponto provide funds to cover defaulted payments to the full extent of itsobligations as insurer.\5\<NOTE/> Moreover, the applicant notes that a master servicer typicallycan recover advances either from the provider of credit support or fromthe future payment stream.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The applicant has clarified that where the master servicerprovides credit support to the trust, it covers defaulted payments ratherthan delinquent payments as stated in item 19 of the preamble to the proposedexemption.The applicant has requested the Department to clarify that the conditionsset forth in paragraph (d) of item 19 apply only where the master servicerand the insurer are affiliated or are the same entity. The applicant furtherrequests clarification that, in the case of a trust that issues subordinatedcertificates which may be held by the servicer or its affiliates, the conditionsreflected in this paragraph would not apply insofar as the definition ofinsurer contained in section III.I. of the proposed exemption states thata person is not an insurer solely because it holds subordinated certificates.The Department concurs with this comment.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Proposed Exemption</ITAG>Subsection I.A. of the proposed exemption states that ``Section I.A. dosnot provide an exemption from the restrictions of secion 406(a)(1)(E),406(a)(2) and 407 for the acquisition or holding of a certificate by anyperson who has discretionary authority or renders investment advice withrespect to the assets of an ``Excluded Plan.'' The applicant expressedconcern that this provision might be read to mean than an independent fiduciarywith respect to an Excluded Plan could not purchase or hold certificateson behalf of a plan that is completely unrelated to the Excluded Plan.The applicant requests that the Department clarify that the exception appliesonly if the assets of the Excluded Plan with respect to which such personis a fiduciary are involved in the transaction. In response to the comment,the Department has revised section I.A. to clarify that the exception applieswhere a person having discretionary authority or rendering investment adviceto an Excluded Plan is acquiring or holding a certificate on behalf ofthat Excluded Plan. Moreover, the Department has revised Section I.A. toclarify that this exception applies to persons rendering investment adviceto an Excluded Plan within the meaning of section 3(21)(A)(ii) of the Actand Department regulation 2510.3-21(c).The applicant has also requested certain modifications to the exemptionas proposed. Paragraph I.B.(1)(ii) of the proposed exemption requires,with regard to section 406(b) relief for sales of certificates, that ``soleyin the case of an acquisition of certificates in connection with the initialissuance of the certificates, at least 50 percent of each class of certificatesis acquired by persons independent of members of the ``Restricted Group.''The applicant notes that the sponsor may retain 100 percent of the subordinatedclass of certificates. The applicant has requested that the Departmentclarify that paragraph I.B.(1)(ii) requires only that this condition besatisfied with respect to classes of certificates to which the exemptionapplies. In this regard, the Department notes that the preamble to theproposed exemption, in describing this provision, provided that section406(b) relief would be limited to situations where at least 50 percentof the aggregate interest in the trust is acquired by persons independentof the Restricted Group. Upon consideration of this comment, the Departmenthas determined to make two modifications to paragraph I.B.(1)(ii) of theexemption. Accordingly, under the final exemption, although the 50% testwould not apply to classes of certificates in which plans do not invest,at least 50% of the aggregate interest in the trust (including all classesof certificates issued by the trust) must be acquired by persons independentof the Restricted Group.Footnote 13 of the proposed exemption provides that ``in the case of aprivate placement memorandum, such memorandum must contain the same informationthat would be disclosed in a prospectus if the offering of the certificateswas made in a registered public offering under the Securities Act of 1933.''The applicant maintains that footnote 13 is inconsistent with the policyof the federal securities laws respecting private placements. For example,in an offering that is made only to ``accredited investors,'' there isno specific information that must be furnished to investors. Similarly,for the majority of private offerings, there is no specific informationrequired. At all times, however, investors have the protection of the federalsecurities laws as well as any applicable ``Blue Sky'' and common law antifraudprovisions. The applicant states that the essential requirements of theselaws are that all material information regarding the offering be furnishedor otherwise made available to investors and that the offering materialsdo not contain any material misstatements or omissions of material facts.In light of the applicant's comment, the Department has determined to revisethe footnote in the exemption to provide that in the case of a privateplacement memorandum, such memorandum must contain substantially the sameinformation that would be disclosed in a prospectus if the offering ofthe certificates were made in a registered public offering under the SecuritiesAct of 1933. Similarly, the Department has determined to modify subsectionI.C.(2) to provide that the pooling and servicing agreement is providedto investing plans or described in all material respects in the prospectusor private placement memorandum. In this regard, the Department notes thatthe private placement memorandum must contain sufficient information topermit plan fiduciaries to make an informed investment decision.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ For purposes of clarity, the Department has substitutedthe term ``private placement memorandum'' in the final exemption for ``privateoffering memorandum'' as used in the proposed exemption.Subsection II.A.(3) of the proposed exemption conditions exemptive reliefupon the certificates acquired by the plan having received a rating thatis in one of the three highest generic rating categories from either Standardandamp; Poor's Corporation (Sandamp;P's), or Moody's Investors Service, Inc.(Moody's) in the case of all certificates covered by the exemption, orDuff andamp; Phelps Inc. (Dandamp;P), if the certificates represent an interestin a trust containing obligations secured by multi-family residential orcommercial real property. As stated in footnote 7 of the preamble to theproposed exemption, it was the Department's understanding at the time ofpublication of the proposed exemption that asset-backed securities underwrittenby Goldman Sachs which are backed by assets other than multi-family residentialmortgages or commercial mortgages have been rated by either Sandamp;P's orMoody's or both. Goldman Sachs has now requested that subsection II.A.(3)and section III.B. of the proposed exemption be modified to include Dandamp;Pas an acceptable rating agency for all types of certificates covered bythe exemption. In this regard, Goldman Sachs represents that Dandamp;P hasbecome increasingly active in rating all types of asset-backed securities,including certificates of the types described in the proposed exemption.Goldman Sachs believes that Dandamp;P is qualified to rate these types ofcertificates and expects to use Dandamp;P to rate these types of certificatesin the future. Based on Goldman Sachs' representations, and additionalinformation contained in a comment on the proposed exemption submittedby Dandamp;P, the Department has determined to revise the exemption to includeDandamp;P as an acceptable rating agency for rating all types of certificatescovered by the exemption. In this regard, Dandamp;P represents that its ratingprocess with respect to all types of certificates included in the proposedexemption is similar to and consistent with that described in the preambleto the proposed exemption.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Dandamp;P has notified the Department that it has recentlychanged its rating scale for all long-term fixed income securities, includingcertificates included in the exemption, from the numerical scale describedin the preamble to the proposed exemption to alphabetical designationswhich are consistent with the designations utilized by Sandamp;P's. As doesSandamp;P, Dandamp;P will use ``+'' and ``^'' to designate further refinementswithin a given rating category. Thus, for example, the highest rating of``Dandamp;P-1'' has been replaced with an ``AAA'' rating, ``Dandamp;P-2'' hasbeen replaced with an ``AA+'' rating, and ``Dandamp;P-7'' has been replacedwith an ``A^'' rating. Dandamp;P represents that it changed to alphabeticaldesignations to facilitate the ease of use of its ratings by investors,and that no other aspect of Dandamp;P's rating procedure will change as aresult of the new rating scale.The applicant has also requested modification of section II.B. of the proposedexemption. This section generally provides that neither any underwriter,sponsor, trustee, servicer, insurer or any obligor (assuming it is nota fiduciary with respect to the plan assets used to acquire certificates)will be subject to penalties under section 502(i) of ERISA or sections4975 (a) and (b) of the Code if the steps specified in this section aretaken to ensure that an investing plan is an accredited investor, evenif the plan is determined not to be an accredited investor. The applicantsuggests that this section should be revised to indicate that all the reliefprovided under Part I will be available if it is later determined thatthe plan was not an accredited investor. The Department has consideredthis comment and has determined to amend section II.B. of the proposedexemption by deleting ``shall be subject to the civil penalties which maybe assessed under section 502(i) of the Act, or the taxes imposed by sections4975 (a) and (b) of the Code,'' and by substituting ``shall be denied therelief provided under Part I'' in lieu thereof.The applicant has requested clarification of the definition of ``trust''in section III.B. First, the applicant notes that pooling and servicingagreements typically provide for the temporary investment of undistributedcash held in the trust pending distribution to certificateholders or applicationto the payment of trust expenses. The applicant therefore has requestedthat subsection III.B.(3) of the proposed exemption be amended to referto ``undistributed cash, or temporary investments made therewith maturingno later than the next distribution date; and''. After considering thissuggested change, the Department has determined to modify the exemptionin the manner requested.The applicant also requests clarification that the definition of the ``trust''in section III.B. of the proposed exemption would include trusts containinginterest-bearing or discount obligations secured by shares issued by acooperative housing association. After considering this comment, the Departmenthas determined to revise paragraph III.B.(1)(a) of the exemption such thatthe category of trusts containing ``secured consumer receivables that bearinterest or are purchased at a discount'' includes ``obligations securedby shares issued by a cooperative housing association.'' For purposes ofclarification, the Department has also determined to amend subsection III.B.(4)of the proposed exemption to include ``rights of the trustee under thepooling and servicing agreement.''Finally, the proposed exemption only would apply to certificates representinga beneficial ownership interest in the assets of a trust that entitle theholder to pass-through payment of principal, interest and/or other paymentsmade with respect to the assets of such trust. In commenting on the proposedexemption, the applicant requested that the Department expand the exemptionto cover certificates denominated as debt instruments and issued by a commonlaw or statutory trust which is a REMIC.\8\<NOTE/> In this regard, the applicant has provided the Departmentwith further information regarding such certificates, as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Department of Labor regulation section 29 CFR 2510.3-101clarifies the definition of ``plan assets'' for the purposes of Title Iof ERISA. In general, the regulation provides that, in the case of a plan'sinvestment in an equity interest of an entity that is neither a publicly-offeredsecurity nor a security issued by an investment company registered underthe Investment Company Act of 1940, its assets include both the equityinterest and an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets ofthe entity, unless the entity is an operating company or equity participationin the entity by benefit plan investors is not significant.<ITAG tagnum="28">Regulation section 29 CFR 2510.3-101(b)(1) defines ``equity interest''to mean any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treatedas indebtedness under applicable local law and which has no substantialequity features. The applicant is concerned that, in certain circumstances,REMIC interests in the form of debt instruments might be recharacterizedas equity interests under this regulation.</ITAG>(1) The applicant states that the decision to structure a transaction asa sale (in the case of pass-through certificates) or as a secured financing(in the case of certificates denominated as debt) is made by a REMIC issueron the basis of the accounting and other regulatory consequences to theissuer. In the absence of a specific regulatory framework (<T3>e.g.,</T3> limiting debt or equity investments to a specified percentageof an investment portfolio), investors in mortgage-backed securities donot distinguish between identically rated REMIC pass-through securitiesor debt instruments because (a) the tax treatment of REMIC pass-throughsecurities and REMIC debt instruments is exactly the same, and (b) ratedREMIC debt instruments are collateralized in accordance with rating agencyguidelines and prescribed procedures so as to assure the same uninterruptedpayment stream as a similarly rated pass-through security.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ In this regard, Sandamp;P's notes that the issuer's creditworthiness, if applicable, is taken into account in determining the ratingof REMIC securities. Thus, in the case of REMIC transactions structuredas a sale, the financial condition of the seller will have no impact onthe REMIC security. REMIC securities structured as debt, however, are impactedby the financial condition of the issuer. In a bankruptcy, payments wouldbe interrupted causing timing delays to investors. Additionally, a bankruptcyjudge would have the power to substitute collateral. Because of these concerns,Sandamp;P's indicates that it will only rate REMIC debt instruments in itshighest rating categories (AAA, AA) when the issuer is a special purposeentity. Such special purpose entities are created solely for the purposeof issuing highly rated debt.(2) A mortgage pass-through certificate represents a beneficial ownershipinterest in a pool of mortgages held by the trustee of a common law orstatutory trust. As explained in the preamble to the proposed exemption,the trustee contracts on behalf of certificateholders with a servicer,who undertakes to service the mortgages in accordance with the terms ofthe pooling and servicing agreement. A REMIC debt instrument, by contrast,represents the promise of an issuer to pay principal in a specified amountand interest thereon at a specified rate, secured by the pledge of a poolof mortgages (or pass-through certificates representing interests in sucha pool, as described below) which is serviced by a servicer in accordancewith the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement entered into withthe issuer, a common law or statutory trust which is the owner of the mortgages.The issuer's promise to pay the debt holders is documented in an indentureentered into by the issuer and an indenture trustee who acts on behalfof the debt holders; (3) In some cases, the issuer will issue pass-through certificates in additionto debt instruments.\10\<NOTE/> Under those circumstances, investors in the REMIC debt instrumentswould have a security interest in the pass-through certificates. In otherecases, the investors in REMIC debt instruments would have a security in``whole'' mortgages which have not been previously securitized as pass-throughcertificates; <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ In this situation, the pass-through certificates wouldbe subordinate to the debt instruments and, consequently, this exemptionwould not apply to plan investment in such pass-through certificates. (4) In the case of REMIC debt instruments, the indenture trustee will eitherbe the assignee of the issuer's interest in the pooling and servicing agreementor, if the debt instruments are secured by pass-through certificates representingbeneficial interests in the issuer (and therefore beneficial interestsin the underlying pooling and servicing agreement), the indenture trusteewill obtain a security interest in the pass-through certificates, includingrights represented thereby in the pooling and servicing agreement. As aresult, in the case of REMIC instruments denominated as debt, the indenturetrustee is responsible in the first instance for the enforcement of theservicing agreement. In consideration of the comments provided regarding REMIC debt instruments,the Department believes that it is appropriate to revise the exemptionto include such instruments, provided that they are issued by a statutoryor common law trust and that the other representations contained in thepreamble to the proposed exemption apply to these instruments (<T3>e.g., </T3>that for tax reasons the trust must be maintained as anessentially passive entity). As a result, the Department has made certainconforming changes to the final exemption, as explained below: (1) The definition of ``Certificate'' contained in subsection III.A. hasbeen expanded to include a certificate demoninated as a debt instrumentthat represents an interest in a REMIC and is issued by, and is an obligationof, a trust; (2) The definition of ``Trustee'' contained in subsection III.H. has beenexpanded to include the trustee of the indenture trust, in the case ofcertificates which are denominated as debt instruments; (3) The Department has added subsection III.V. which defines ``Poolingand Servicing Agreement''. This subsection states that ``Pooling and ServicingAgreement'' means the agreement or agreements among a sponsor, a servicerand the trustee establishing a trust, and, in the case of certificateswhich are denominated as debt instruments, also includes the indentureentered into between the trustee of the trust issuing such certificatesand the indenture trustee. <ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous</ITAG>1. Six comments were received requesting that the Department issue a classexemption that could be utilized by other investment banking firms, banksand bank affiliates which underwrite asset-backed securities. The commentsrequesting that the Department issue a class exemption included suggestedmodifications to the proposed exemption which these commentators believeshould be made if the Department determines to issue a class exemption.In this regard, the Department notes that consideration of a class exemptionis beyond the scope of this proceeding for individual exemptive relief.Finally, the Deaprtment wishes to take the opportunity to state that thecommentators may wish to consider applications for individual relief undersection 408(a) of ERISA. 2. In addition, other commenters requested that the Department amend PTE83-1 (48 FR 895, January 7, 1983), Class Exemption for Certain TransactionsInvolving Mortgage Pool Investment Trusts, to incorporate certain changeswhich conform to any class or individual exemption the Department issueswith respect to asset-backed securities. With respect to these comments,the Department notes that amendment of PTE 83-1 is beyond the scope ofthis proceeding.3. Part II of the preamble to the proposed exemption states that to bean ``accredited investor'' under Rule 501(a)(1) of Regulation D under theSecurities Act of 1933, a plan would need to have at least $5 million inassets, or the decision to invest in certificates would have to be madeon behalf of the plan by a bank, insurance company or an investment adviserregistered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. It has come to theDeaprtment's attention that Rule 501(a)(1) has recently been amended toinclude as an accredited investor a plan on behalf of which the investmentdecision is made by a savings and loan association. In the Department'sview, such a plan would meet the requirement of subsection II.A.(6) ofthe exemption. Moreover, the Department contemplates that the conditioncontained in subsection II.A.(6) of the exemption would be met if the investingplan is an accredited investor within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1) asamended from time to time. 4. One commentator suggested that the term ``Underwriter'' as defined insubsection III.C.(3) of the proposed exemption be modified to include membersof the selling group which places certificates with investors, includingplans, even though the members of the selling group are not members ofthe underwriting syndicate. After considering this comment, and discussingthe modification with the applicant, the Department has determined to modifythe definition of underwriter in subsection III.C.(3) of the exemptionto include any member of a selling group of which Goldman Sachs or a persondescribed in subsection III.C.(2) of the exemption is a manager or co-manager.5. Two commentators requested clarification of the condition containedin subsection II.A.(2) of the proposed exemption that ``the rights andinterests evidenced by the certificates are not subordinated to the rightsand interests evidenced by other certificates of the same trust''. Thesecommentators noted that, in a common form of subordinated certificate transaction,two classes of certificates (``A'' and ``B'') are created and paymentsare shared pro rata among all certificates except that cash flow shortfallsresulting from defaults and delinquencies on the obligations in the poolare first borne by the subordinated ``B'' class. Thereafter, recoverieswith respect to such defaulted payments would be available (to the extentthat the other assets in the pool are producing sufficient cash flow tomake distributions to the A class) to make distributions to the B classto the extent of the prior losses borne by such class. These commentatorsstated that they assume that the B class would be considered ``subordinated''within the meaning of the proposed exemption and, thus, ineligible forexemptive relief. The commentators, however, requested that the Departmentclarify that the ``A'' class would not be considered subordinated merelybecause recoveries with respect to defaulted and delinquent obligationscould result in the ``B'' class receiving ``catch-up'' payments. The Departmentconcurs with the view expressed by the commentators.In addition, these commentators state that it is unclear how the ``no subordination''requirement would apply in the case of a REMIC trust in which the classA certificates described in the previous example could be further subdividedinto several classes (<T3>e.g.</T3>, A-1 through A-4) with payment being made in sequence inthe classes. Defaults on the underlying obligations in the pool would firstbe absorbed by the B class. However, in the event of massive defaults (<T3>i.e.,</T3> far in excess of rating agency projections) it is possiblefor the A-2 through A-4 classes to be subordinated to the prior A classesunless the governing documents provide otherwise. The commentators statethat class A-2 through A-4 certificates in such a structure should notbe treated differently from the class A-1 certificates. They further arguethat the Department should consider permitting senior certificates of thistype to qualify for relief, notwithstanding possible subordination to otherclasses of senior certificates, if another class of certificates is subordinatedto all classes of senior certificates and the certificates in questionhave achieved a high rating (<T3>e.g.</T3>, one of the two highest rating categories). The Departmentdoes not believe that it has a sufficient basis upon which to provide exemptiverelief for any subordinated certificates at this time. Furthermore, theDepartment notes that the applicant has not requested such relief. Accordingly,the Department is not modifying the condition contained in subsection II.A.(2)of the proposed exemption as requested.6. Three commentators requested that the Department make clear that ``strip''and ``fast-pay/slow-pay'' certificates (described in item 5 of the preambleto the proposed exemption) would not be deemed to be subordinated merelybecause they are of classes having rights to disproportionate principalor interest payments or because they are of classes having different statedmaturities. The Department notes that, as stated in Item 5 of the preambleto the proposed exemption, the applicants have represented that in neithercase will the rights of a plan purchasing certificates be subordinatedto the rights of another certificateholder in the event of default on anyof the underlying obligations. The Department believes that the exemptionwould apply to any class of ``strip'' and ``fast-pay/slow-pay'' certificatesto which that representation applies.7. The Department received comments from Dandamp;P, Fitch Investors Services,Inc. (Fitch), and McCarthy, Crisanti andamp; Maffei, Inc. (McCarthy), eachrequesting that it be included as an acceptable rating agency for ratingall types of certificates covered by the exemption. As noted above, theapplicant requested in its comment filed with the Department that the proposedexemption be modified to include Dandamp;P as an acceptable rating agencyfor rating all types of certificates covered by the exemption, and theDepartment has determined to modify the final exemption accordingly. However,since the applicant has not requested that the Department revise the proposedexemption to include Fitch and McCarthy as acceptable rating agencies,the Department has decided that it would not be appropriate to furthermodify the exemption in this manner. The Department wishes to emphasize,however, that no implication should be drawn regarding these rating agencies,and that the Department would be willing to consider these other ratingagencies for rating certificates with regard to other asset-backed securitiesindividual exemption requests.8. Three commentators noted that the proposed exemption does not make clearwhether the certificates covered by the proposed exemption must have receivedthe requisite rating solely at the time of purchase by the plan, or whethersuch rating must be maintained while the plan holds the certificates. Thecommentators state that the exemption should specify that the rating requirementonly applies at the time the certificates are purchased by the plan. TheDepartment agrees with this comment and, accordingly, has modified subsectionII.A.(3) of the exemption to clarify that the rating condition need onlybe met at the time the certificates are acquired by the plan. In this regard,the Department notes that ERISA section 404(a)(1)(B) would require thata fiduciary act prudently in determining whether a plan should continueto hold certificates, as well as with respect to the initial decision topurchase the certificates.9. One commentator requested that the Department clarify that trusts containingassets of a type which have not been specifically considered by the Departmentwould be covered by the exemption provided that such assets satisfy thecondition set forth in section III.B. of the exemption. The Departmentagrees that the exemption would be available with respect to such trustsprovided that the condition contained in section III.B and the other conditionsof the exemption are met.10. One commentator stated that it is not clear whether the conditionsimposed by paragraphs I.B.(1)(i) through (iv) (with respect to section406(b) relief for sales or transfers in the initial issuance of certificates)would apply also to subsections I.B.(2) (with respect to section 406(b)relief for acquisitions or dispositions in the secondary market) and I.B.(3)(with respect to section 406(b) relief for the continued holding of certificatesby a plan pursuant to subsections I.B.(1) or (2)). In response to the comment,the Department has clarified subsection I.B.(2) of the exemption to makeclear that the relief contained therein is available provided that theconditions set forth in paragraphs I.B.(1)(i), (iii) and (iv) are met.11. Two commentators questioned why retroactive exemptive relief was proposedfor Salomon and First Boston as of November 1, 1985, whereas the effectivedate for Goldman Sachs' proposed exemption is January 1, 1987. In thisregard, the Department notes that Salomon and First Boston, in their respectiveapplications, requested an effective date of November 1, 1985, and thatGoldman Sachs, Inc. requested an effective date of January 1, 1987.After consideration of the entire record, the Department has determinedto grant the exemption, as modified herein.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Paul Kelty of the Department,telephone (202) 523-8194.

DefinitionsFor purposes of this exemption:A. ``<T3>Certificate</T3>'' means:(1) A certificate_(a) That represents a beneficial ownership interest in the assets of atrust; and(b) That entitles the holder to pass-through payments of principal, interest,and/or other payments made with respect to the assets of such trust;

These are discussed below.Applicant Comments<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Summary of Facts and Representations</ITAG>The applicant has commented on or clarified certain aspects of the proposedexemption. In this regard, the applicant notes that item 4 of the preambleto the proposed exemption states that, prior to the closing date, the sponsoracquires legal title to all assets selected for the trust. The applicantindicates that in many transactions, the sponsor acquires legal title toassets selected for the trust on the closing date and concurrently conveysto the trust legal title to the assets.In addition, item 4 states that certificateholders are entitled to receivemonthly or quarterly installments of principal and/or interest, or leasepayments due on the receivables. The applicant has requested that the Departmentclarify that the exemption is available for the receipt of semi-annualpayments by certificateholders. In this regard, the applicant representsthat when payments are made on this basis, funds are not permitted to becommingled with the servicer's assets for longer than would be permittedfor a monthly-pay security. A segregated account is established in thename of the trustee (on behalf of certificateholders) to hold funds receivedbetween distribution dates. The account is under the sole control of thetrustee, who invests the account's assets in short-term securities whichhave received a rating comparable to the rating assigned to the certificates.In some cases, the servicer may be permitted to make a single deposit intothe account once a month. When the servicer makes such monthly deposits,payments received from obligors by the servicer may be commingled withthe servicer's assets during the month prior to deposit. In no event willthe period of time between receipt of funds by the servicer and depositof these funds in a segregated account exceed one month. Furthermore, inthose cases where distributions are made semi-annually, the servicer willfurnish a report on the operation of the trust to the trustee on a monthlybasis. At or about the time this report is delivered to the trustee, itwill be made available to certificateholders and delivered to or made availableto each rating agency that has rated the certificates. After consideringthe applicant's comments with regard to semi-annual payments to certificateholders,the Department has concluded that the exemption is available for semi-annual(rather than monthly or quarterly) payments made to certificateholders,provided that the conditions set forth in the exemption are met.  With respect to item 5, the applicant notes that in some transactions fastpay/slow pay certificates may involve certificates which have the samematurities but different payment schedules.\1\\4\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\Salomon also has clarified that, if a trust issues subordinatecertificates, holders of such subordinate certificates may not share inthe amount distributed on a pro rata basis. The Department notes that theexemption does not provide relief for plan investment in such subordinatedcertificates.  Item 9 of the preamble to the proposed exemption states that the trustee'sfee is paid by the servicer. The applicant notes that in some transactions,the trustee's fee is not paid by the servicer but rather is paid by theseller or sponsor or out of trust assets. For example, the trustee's feesmay be paid out of investment earnings on undistributed cash or from specifiedamounts on deposit in the trust, as is the case with the servicer's compensation.The method of compensating the trustee will be specified in the poolingand servicing agreement and disclosed in the prospectus or private placementmemorandum relating to the offering of the certificates.  The second paragraph of item 11 of the preamble to the proposed exemptionstates, that as compensation for the receivable transferred to the trust,the sponsor receives certificates representing the entire beneficial interestin the trust which it sells for cash to investors or securities underwriters.The applicant has clarified that in some transactions the sponsor may retaina portion of the certificates for its own account. In addition, the applicantnotes that in some transactions the originator may sell receivables toa trust for cash. At the time of the sale, the trustee would sell certificatesto the public or to underwriters and use the cash proceeds of the saleto pay the originator for the receivables sold to the trust.  The second paragraph of item 13 states that the ``credit support fee''paid to the servicer is paid out of the payments received on the receivablesin excess of the pass-through payments made to certificateholders. Theapplicant notes that in some transactions the ``credit support fee'' ispaid in a lump sum at the time the trust is established.  With respect to item 16, the applicant notes that, for some public offerings,Salomon may sell certificates on an agency basis in a best efforts underwriting.In these cases, Salomon would receive an agency commission. The applicantfurther notes that in some private placements Salomon may buy certificatesas principal, in which case its fee would consist of the difference betweenwhat it receives for the certificates that it sells and what it pays thesponsor for these certificates.  Item 17 of the preamble to the proposed exemption states that the poolingand servicing agreement generally provides that the servicer may purchasea receivable included in the trust when the balance payable on the receivableis reduced to a specified percentage (usually 10 percent) of the initialbalance. The applicant has clarified that the servicer may purchase thereceivables then included in the trust when the <T3>aggregate</T3> unpaid balance on the receivables is reduced to a specifiedpercentage (usually 10 percent) of the initial balance.  Item 19 of the preamble to the proposed exemption states that where themaster servicer or its affiliate provides credit support to the trust,the master servicer, in its capacity as servicer, will first advance fundsif it determines that such advances are recoverable out of late paymentsby the obligors or amounts otherwise distributable to holders of subordinatedcertificates. Otherwise, the master servicer, as the provider of creditsupport, will be called upon to provide funds to cover such payments tothe full extent of its obligations as insurer. The applicant notes thatthe arrangement described in item 19 is the typical arrangement. However,the applicant further notes that in some transactions the master servicermay not be obligated to advance funds, but instead would be called uponto provide funds to cover defaulted payments to the full extent of itsobligations as insurer.\1\\5\<NOTE/> Moreover, the applicant notes that a master servicer typicallycan recover advances either from the provider of credit support or fromfuture payments on affected assets.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\The applicant has clarified that where the master servicerprovides credit support to the trust, it covers <T3>defaulted </T3>payments rather than delinquent payments as stated initem 19 of the preamble to the proposed exemption.  The applicant has requested the Department clarify that the conditionsset forth in paragraph (d) of item 19 apply only where the master servicerand the insurer are affiliated or are the same entity. The applicant furtherrequests clarification that, in the case of a trust that issues subordinatedcertificates which may be held by the servicer or its affiliates, the representationsreflected in this paragraph would not apply insofar as the definition ofinsurer contained in section III.I. of the proposed exemption states thata person is not an insurer solely because it holds subordinated certificates.The Department concurs with this comment.  With regard to item 23 of the preamble to the proposed exemption, the applicantnotes that a rating agency may not automatically receive reports regardingthe operation of the trust at or about the time distributions are madeto certificateholders, unless the rating agency requests that all reportsbe delivered to it. These reports will be available to any rating agencythat rated the certificates upon its request, and will be delivered tothe rating agency as frequently as requested by the rating agency.  <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Proposed Exemption </ITAG>Section I.A. of the proposed exemption states that ``section I.A. doesnot provide an exemption from the restrictions of section 406(a)(1)(E),406(a)(2) and 407 for the acquisition or holding of a certificate by anyperson who has discretionary authority or renders investment advice withrespect to the assets of an ``Excluded Plan.'' The applicant requests clarificationthat this exception applies only to a person who becomes a fiduciary toan Excluded Plan by reason of rendering investment advice. In responseto the comment, the Department has revised section I.A. to clarify thatthis exception applies to persons who render investment advice to ExcludedPlans within the meaning of section 3(21)(A)(ii) of the Act and Departmentregulation 2510.3-21(c). The applicant also expressed concern that thisprovision might be read to suggest that an independent fiduciary with respectto an Excluded Plan could not purchase or hold certificates on behalf ofa plan that is completely unrelated to the Excluded Plan. The applicantrequests that the Department clarify that the exception applies only ifthe assets of the Excluded Plan with respect to which such person is afiduciary are involved in the transaction. The Department has adopted thiscomment and revised section I.A. to clarify that the exception applieswhere a person having discretionary authority or rendering investment adviceto an Excluded Plan is acquiring or holding a certificate on behalf ofthat Excluded Plan. The applicant has also requested certain modifications to the exemptionas proposed. Paragraph I.B.(1)(ii) of the proposed exemption requires,with regard to section 406(b) relief for sales of certificates, that ``solelyin the case of an acquisition of certificates in connection with the initialissuance of the certificates, at least 50 percent of each class of certificatesis acquired by persons independent of members of the ``Restricted Group.''The applicant notes that frequently the sponsor retains 100 percent ofthe subordinated class of certificates, and that, therefore, the proposedexemption would effectively eliminate section 406(b) relief for transactionsin which subordinated certificates are issued. The applicant requests thatthe Department amend paragraph I.B.(1)(ii) to require that ``at least 50percent of the certificates being offered (other than certificates of aclass of subordinated certificates) is acquired by persons independentof the members of the Restricted Group.'' In this regard, the Departmentnotes that the preamble to the proposed exemption, in describing this provision,provided that section 406(b) relief would be limited to situations whereat least 50 percent of the aggregate interest in the trust is acquiredby persons independent of the Restricted Group. Upon consideration of thiscomment, the Department has determined to make two modifications to paragraphI.B.(1)(ii) of the exemption. Accordingly, under the final exemption, althoughthe 50% test would not apply to classes of certificates in which plansdo not invest, at least 50% of the aggregate interest in the trust (includingall classes of certificates issued by the trust) must be acquired by personsindependent of the Restricted Group.Subsection I.C.(2) of the proposed exemption requires, with respect toexemptive relief for servicing and operation of the trust, that ``the poolingand servicing agreement is provided to, or fully described in, the prospectusor private offering memorandum provided to investing plans before theypurchase certificates issued by the trust.'' The applicant notes that thefederal securities laws require a prospectus to contain all informationmaterial to an investor's decision to acquire a security. Consequently,the issuer may omit from its disclosure document a description of provisionsthat are immaterial or irrelevant to purchasers of the offered certificates.The applicant indicates that, because the pooling and servicing agreementis available to investors before they invest in certificates, investorsare better served by receiving a disclosure document that is more easilyunderstood while still describing the pooling and servicing agreement inall material respects. Therefore, the applicant requests clarificationthat ``fully described'' as used in the proposed exemption is intendedonly to require that the pooling and servicing agreement is described inall material respects. On the basis of this comment, the Department hasmodified subsection I.C.(2) to incorporate the applicant's suggested change.In this regard, the Department notes that the description of the poolingand servicing agreement contained in the prospectus or private placementmemorandum must contain sufficient information to permit plan fiduciariesto make an informed investment decision.\16\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ For purposes of clarity, the Department has substitutedthe term ``private placement memorandum'' in the final exemption for ``privateoffering memorandum'' as used in the proposed exemption.Footnote 13 of the proposed exemption provides that ``in the case of aprivate placement memorandum, such memorandum must contain the same informationthat would be disclosed in a prospectus if the offering of the certificateswas made in a registered public offering under the Securities Act of 1933.''The applicant notes that a private placement memorandum would never beidentical to a prospectus used in an offering registered under the SecuritiesAct of 1933. In particular, while a prospectus and a private placementmemorandum would each contain all information material to an investor'sdecision to acquire certificates, a private placement memorandum wouldnot contain, for example, statements regarding filing of a registrationstatement. Moreover, a private placement memorandum may describe restrictionson transfer of certificates because they are not registered under the SecuritiesAct of 1933; a prospectus would not contain such information. The applicantrepresents that, under the federal securities laws, the level of prescribeddisclosure in a private placement varies depending, in part, on the typeof issuer, the nature of proposed offerees, and the characteristics ofthe security being offered. The applicant further indicates that compliancewith applicable antifraud provisions of federal securities law would requirethat all material information regarding the offering (including the securitiesbeing offered and the nature and operation of the issuer) be disclosedto investors prior to their purchase of any of the securities being offered.In light of the applicant's comments, the Department has determined torevise the footnote in the final exemption to provide that, in the caseof a private placement memorandum, such memorandum must contain substantiallythe same information that would be disclosed in a prospectus if the offeringof the certificates were made in a registered public offering under theSecurities Act of 1933.Subsection II.A.(3) of the proposed exemption conditions exemptive reliefupon the certificates acquired by the plan having received a rating thatis in one of the three highest generic rating categories from either Standardandamp; Poors Corporation (Sandamp;P's), or Moody's Investors Service, Inc.(Moody's) in the case of all certificates covered by the exemption, orDuff andamp; Phelps Inc. (Dandamp;P), if the certificates represent an interstin a trust containing obligations secured by multi-family residential orcommercial real property. As stated in footnote 7 of the preamble to theproposed exemption, it was the Department's understanding at the time ofpublication of the proposed exemption that asset-backed securities underwrittenby Salomon which are backed by assets other than multi-family residentialmortgages or commercial mortgages have been rated by either Sandamp;P's orMoody's or both. Salomon has now requested that subsection II.A.(3) andsection III.B. of the proposed exemption be modified to include Dandamp;Pas an acceptable rating agency for all types of certificates covered bythe exemption. Salomon represents that Dandamp;P has become increasinglyactive in rating all types of asset-backed securities, including certificatesof the types described in the proposed exemption. Salomon believes thatDandamp;P is qualified to rate these types of certificates and expects touse Dandamp;P to rate these types of certificates in the future. Based onSalomon's representations, and additional information submitted by Dandamp;P,the Department has determined to revise the exemption to include Dandamp;Pas an acceptable rating agency for rating all types of certificates coveredby the exemption. In this regard, Dandamp;P represents that its rating processwith respect to all types of certificates included in the proposed exemptionis similar to and consistent with that described in the preamble to theproposed exemption.\1\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ Dandamp;P has notified the Department that it has recentlychanged its rating scale for all long-term fixed income securities, includingcertificates included in the exemption, from the numerical scale describedin the preamble to the proposed exemption to alphabetical designationswhich are consistent with the designations utilized by Sandamp;P's. As doesSandamp;P, Dandamp;P will use ``+'' and ``^`' to designate further refinementswithin a given rating category. Thus, for example, the highest rating of``Dandamp;P-1'' has been replaced with an ``AAA'' rating, ``Dandamp;P-2'' hasbeen replaced with an ``AA+'' rating, and ``Dandamp;P-7'' has been replacedwith an ``A^'' rating. Dandamp;P represents that it changed to alphabeticaldesignations to facilitate the ease of use of its ratings by investors,and that no other aspect of Dandamp;P's rating procedure will change as aresult of the new rating scale.The applicant has also requested modification of section II.B. of the proposedexemption. This section generally provides that neither any underwriter,sponsor, trustee, servicer, insurer or any obligor (assuming it is nota fiduciary with respect to the plan assets used to acquire certificates)will be subject to penalties under section 502(i) of ERISA or sections4975(a) and (b) of the Code if the steps specified in this section aretaken to ensure that an investing plan is an accredited investor, evenif it is later determined that the plan is not an accredited investor.The applicant has expressed concern that if a plan is not an accreditedinvestor, notwithstanding that the specified steps have been taken, therelief provided by part I of the exemption would not be available. TheDepartment has considered this comment and has determined to amend sectionII.B. of the proposed exemption by deleting ``shall be subject to the civilpenalties which may be assessed under section 502(i) of the Act, or thetaxes imposed by sections 4975(a) and (b) of the Code,'' and by substituting``shall be denied the relief provided under Part I'' in lieu thereof.The application has requested clarification of the definition of ``trust''in section III.B. in three respects. First, the applicant notes that poolingand servicing agreements typically provide for the temporary investmentof undistributed cash held in the trust in ``permitted investments'' pendingdistribution to certificateholders or application to the payment of trustexpenses. ``Permitted investments'' are subject to careful scrutiny bythe rating agencies and consist of investments such as governmental obligations.The applicant, therefore, has requested that subsection III.B.(3) of theproposed exemption be amended to read as follows: ``Undistributed cash,or temporary investments made therewith maturing no later than the nextdistribution date; and''. The second change requested by the applicantwith respect to section III.B. of the exemption concerns subsection III.B.(4).The application notes that the trustee has a variety of rights under thepooling and servicing agreement that it may exercise for the benefit ofcertificateholders which are assets of the trust. Accordingly, the applicanthas requested that the Department amend subsection III.B.(4) of the proposedexemption to include ``rights of the trustee under the pooling and servicingagreement.'' After considering these two suggested changes, the Departmenthas determined to modify the exemption in the manner requested.Third, the applicant requests clarification that the definition of theterm ``trust'' in section III.B. of the proposed exemption would includetrusts containing interest-bearing or discount obligations secured by sharesissued by a cooperative housing association. After considering this comment,the Department has determined to revise paragraph III.B.(1)(a) of the exemptionsuch that the category of trusts containing ``secured consumer receivablesthat bear interest or are purchased at a discount'' includes ``obligationssecured by shares issued by a cooperative housing association.''Finally, the proposed exemption only would apply to certificates representinga beneficial ownership interest in the assets of a trust that entitle theholder to pass-through payments of principal, interest and/or other paymentsmade with respect to the assets of such trust. In commenting on the proposedexemption, the applicant requested that the Department expand the exemptionto cover certificates denominated as debt instruments and issued by a commonlaw or statutory trust which is a REMIC.\1\\8\<NOTE/> In this regard, the applicant has provided the Departmentwith further information regarding such certificates, as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ Department of Labor regulation section 29 CFR 2510.3-101clarifies the definition of ``plan assets'' for the purposes of Title Iof ERISA. In general, the regulation provides that, in the case of a plan'sinvestment in an equity interest of an entity that is neither a publicly-offeredsecurity nor a security issued by an investment company registered underthe Investment Company Act of 1940, its assets include both the equityinterest and an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets ofthe entity, unless the entity is an operating company or equity participationin the entity by benefit plan investors is not significant.<ITAG tagnum="28">Regulation section 29 CFR 2510.3-101(b)(1) defines ``equity interest''to mean any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treatedas indebtedness under applicable local law and which has no substantialequity features. The applicant is concerned that, in certain circumstances,REMIC interests in the form of debt instruments might be recharacterizedas equity interests under this regulation.</ITAG>(1) The applicant states that the decision to structure a transaction asa sale (in the case of pass-through certificates) or as a secured financing(in the case of certificates denominated as debt) is made by a REMIC issueron the basis of the accounting and other regulatory consequences to theissuer. In the absence of a specific regulatory framework (<T3>e.g., </T3>limiting debt or equity investments to a specified percentageof an investment portfolio), investors in mortgage-backed securities donot distinguish between identically rated REMIC pass-through securitiesor debt instruments because (a) the tax treatment of REMIC pass-throughsecurities and REMIC debt instruments is exactly the same, and (b) ratedREMIC debt instruments are collateralized in accordance with rating agencyguidelines and prescribed procedures so as to assure the same uninterruptedpayment stream as a similarly rated pass-through security.\1\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ In this regard, Sandamp;P's notes that the issuer's creditworthiness, if applicable, is taken into account in determining the ratingof REMIC securities. Thus, in the case of REMIC transactions structuredas a sale, the financial condition of the seller will have no impact onthe REMIC security. REMIC securities structured as debt, however, are impactedby the financial condition of the issuer. In a bankruptcy, payments wouldbe interrupted causing timing delays to investors. Additionally, a bankruptcyjudge would have the power to substitute collateral. Because of these concerns,Sandamp;P's indicates that it will only rate REMIC debt instruments in itshighest rating categories (AAA, AA) when the issuer is a special purposeentity. Such special purpose entities are created solely for the purposeof issuing highly rated debt.(2) A mortgage pass-through certificate represents a beneficial ownershipinterest in a pool of mortgages held by the trustee of a common law orstatutory trust. As explained in the preamble to the proposed exemption,the trustee contracts on behalf of certificateholders with a servicer,who undertakes to service the mortgages in accordance with the terms ofthe pooling and servicing agreement. A REMIC debt instrument, by contrast,represents the promise of an issuer to pay principal in a specified amountand interest thereon at a specified rate, secured by the pledge of a poolof mortgages (or pass-through certificates representing interests in sucha pool, as described below) which is serviced by a servicer in accordancewith the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement entered into withthe issuer, a common law or statutory trust which is the owner of the mortgages.The issuer's promise to pay the debt holders is documented in an indentureentered into by the issuer and an indenture trustee who acts on behalfof the debt holders;(3) In some cases, the issuer will issue pass-through certificates in additionto debt instruments.\2\\0\<NOTE/> Under those circumstances, investors in the REMIC debt instrumentswould have a security interest in the pass-through certificates. In othercases, the investors in REMIC debt instruments would have a security interestin ``whole'' mortgages which have not been previously securitized as pass-throughcertificates;<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ In this situation, the pass-through certificates wouldbe subordinate to the debt instruments and, consequently, this exemptionwould not apply to plan investment in such pass-through certificates.(4) In the case of REMIC debt instruments, the indenture trustee will eitherbe the assignee of the issuer's interest in the pooling and servicing agreementor, if the debt instruments are secured by pass-through certificates representingbeneficial interests in the issuer (and therefore beneficial interestsin the underlying pooling and servicing agreement), the indenture trusteewill obtain a security interest in the pass-through certificates, includingrights represented thereby in the pooling and servicing agreement. As aresult, in the case of REMIC instruments denominated as debt, the indenturetrustee is responsible in the first instance for the enforcement of theservicing agreement.In consideration of the comments provided regarding REMIC debt instruments,the Department believes that it is appropriate to revise the exemptionto include such instruments, provided that they are issued by a statutoryor common law trust and that the other representations contained in thepreamble to the proposed exemption apply to these instruments (<T3>e.g., </T3>that for tax reasons the trust must be maintained as anessentially passive entity). As a result, the Department has made certainconforming changes to the final exemption, as explained below:(1) The definition of ``Certificate'' contained in subsection III.A. hasbeen expanded to include a certificate denominated as a debt instrumentthat represents an interest in a REMIC and is issued by, and is an obligationof, a trust;(2) The definition of ``Trustee'' contained in subsection III.H. has beenexpanded to include the trustee of the indenture trust, in the case ofcertificates which are denominated as debt instruments;(3) The Department has added subsection III.V. which defines ``Poolingand Servicing Agreement.'' This subsection states that ``Pooling and ServicingAgreement'' means the agreement or agreements among a sponsor, a servicerand the trustee establishing a trust, and, in the case of certificateswhich are denominated as debt instruments, also includes the indentureentered into between the trustee of the trust issuing such certificatesand the indenture trustee.Miscellaneous1. Six comments were received requesting that the Department issue a classexemption that could be utilized by other investment banking firms, banksand bank affiliates which underwrite asset-backed securities. The commentsrequesting that the Department issue a class exemption included suggestedmodifications to the proposed exemption which these commentators believeshould be made if the Department determines to issue a class exemption.In this regard, the Department notes that consideration of a class exemptionis beyond the scope of this proceeding for individual exemptive relief.Finally, the Department wishes to take the opportunity to state that thecommentators may wish to consider applications for individual relief undersection 408(a) of ERISA.2. In addition, other commentators requested that the Department amendPTE 83-1 (48 FR 895, January 7, 1983), Class Exemption for Certain TransactionsInvolving Mortgage Pool Investment Trusts, to incorporate certain changeswhich conform to any class or individual exemption the Department issueswith respect to asset-backed securities. With respect to these comments,the Department notes that amendment of PTE 83-1 is beyond the scope ofthis proceeding.3. Part II of the preamble to the proposed exemption states that to bean ``accredited investor'' under Rule 501(a)(1) of Regulation D under theSecurities Act of 1933, a plan would need to have at least $5 million inassets, or the decision to invest in certificates would have to be madeon behalf of the plan by a bank, insurance company or an investment adviserregistered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. It has come to theDepartment's attention that Rule 501(a)(1) has recently been amended toinclude as an accredited investor a plan on behalf of which the investmentdecision is made by a savings and loan association. In the Department'sview, such a plan would meet the requirement of subsection II.A.(6) ofthe exemption. Moreover, the Department contemplates that the conditioncontained in subsection II.A.(6) of the exemption would be met if the investingplan is an accredited investor within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1) asamended from time to time.4. One commentator suggested that the term ``Underwriter'' as defined insubsection III.C.(3) of the proposed exemption be modified to include membersof the selling group which places certificates with investors, includingplans, even though the members of the selling group are not members ofthe underwriting syndicate. After considering this comment, and discussingthe modification with the applicant, the Department has determined to modifythe definition of underwriter in subsection III.C.(3) of the exemptionto include any member of a selling group of which Salomon or a person describedin subsection III.C.(2) of the exemption is a manager or co-manager.5. Two commentators requested clarification of the condition containedin subsection II.A.(2) of the proposed exemption that ``the rights andinterests evidenced by the certificates are not subordinated to the rightsand interests evidenced by other certificates of the same trust''. Thesecommentators noted that, in a common form of subordinated certificate transaction,two classes of certificates (``A'' and ``B'') are created and paymentsare shared pro rata among all certificates except that cash flow shortfallsresulting from defaults and delinquencies on the obligations in the poolare first borne by the subordinated ``B'' class. Thereafter, recoverieswith respect to such defaulted payments would be available (to the extentthat the other assets in the pool are producing sufficient cash flow tomake distributions to the A class) to make distributions to the B classto the extent of the prior losses borne by such class. These commentatorsstated that they assume that the B class would be considered ``subordinated''within the meaning of the proposed exemption and, thus, ineligible forexemptive relief. The commentators, however, requested that the Departmentclarify that the ``A'' class would not be considered subordinated merelybecause recoveries with respect to defaulted and delinquent obligationscould result in the ``B'' class receiving ``catch-up'' payments. The Departmentconcurs with the view expressed by the commentators.In addition, these commentators state that it is unclear how the ``no subordination''requirement would apply in the case of a REMIC trust in which the classA certificates described in the previous example could be further subdividedinto several classes (<T3>e.g.,</T3> A-1 through A-4) with payment being made in sequence inthe classes. Defaults on the underlying obligations in the pool would firstbe absorbed by the B class. However, in the event of massive defaults (<T3>i.e.,</T3> far in excess of rating agency projections) it is possiblefor the A-2 through A-4 classes to be subordinated to the prior A classesunless the governing documents provide otherwise. The commentators statethat class A-2 through A-4 certificates in such a structure should notbe treated differently from the class A-1 certificates. They further arguethat the Department should consider permitting senior certificates of thistype to qualify for relief, notwithstanding possible subordination to otherclasses of senior certificates, if another class of certificates is subordinatedto all classes of senior certificates and the certificates in questionhave achieved a high rating (<T3>e.g.,</T3> one of the two highest rating categories). The Departmentdoes not believe that it has a sufficient basis upon which to provide exemptiverelief for any subordinated certificates at this time. Furthermore, theDepartment notes that the applicant has not requested such relief. Accordingly,the Department is not modifying the condition contained in subsection II.A.(2)of the proposed exemption as requested.6. Three commentators requested that the Department make clear that ``strip''and ``fast-pay/slow-pay'' certificates (described in item 5 of the preambleto the proposed exemption) would not be deemed to be subordinated merelybecause they are of classes having rights to disproportionate principalor interest payments or because they are of classes having different statedmaturities. The Department notes that, as stated in Item 5 of the preambleto the proposed exemption, the applicants have represented that in neithercase will the rights of a plan purchasing certificates be subordinatedto the rights of another certificateholder in the event of default on anyof the underlying obligations. The Department believes that the exemptionwould apply to any class of ``strip'' and ``fast-pay/slow-pay'' certificatesto which that representation applies.7. The Department received comments from Dandamp;P, Fitch Investors Services,Inc. (Fitch), and McCarthy, Crisanti andamp; Maffei, Inc. (McCarthy), eachrequesting that it be included as an acceptable rating agency for ratingall types of certificates covered by the exemption. As noted above, theapplicant requested in its comment filed with the Department that the proposedexemption be modified to include Dandamp;P as an acceptable rating agencyfor rating all types of certificates covered by the exemption, and theDepartment has determined to modify the final exemption accordingly. However,since the applicant has not requested that the Department revise the proposedexemption to include Fitch and McCarthy as acceptable rating agencies,the Department has decided that it would not be appropriate to furthermodify the exemption in this manner. The Department wishes to emphasize,however, that no implication should be drawn regarding these rating agencies,and that the Department would be willing to consider these other ratingagencies for rating certificates with regard to other asset-backed securitiesindividual exemption requests.8. Three commentators noted that the proposed exemption does not make clearwhether the certificates covered by the proposed exemption must have receivedthe requisite rating solely at the time of purchase by the plan, or whethersuch rating must be maintained while the plan holds the certificates. Thecommentators state that the exemption should specify that the rating requirementonly applies at the time the certificates are purchased by the plan. TheDepartment agrees with this comment and, accordingly, has modified subsectionII.A.(3) of the exemption to clarify that the rating condition need onlybe met at the time the certificates are acquired by the plan. In this regard,the Department notes that ERISA section 404(a)(1)(B) would require thata fiduciary act prudently in determining whether a plan should continueto hold certificates, as well as with respect to the initial decision topurchase the certificates.9. One commentator requested that the Department clarify that trusts containingassets of a type which have not been specifically considered by the Departmentwould be covered by the exemption provided that such assets satisfy thecondition set forth in section III.B. of the exemption. The Departmentagrees that the exemption would be available with respect to such trustsprovided that the condition contained in section III.B. and the other conditionsof the exemption are met.10. One commentator stated that it is not clear whether the conditionsimposed by paragraphs I.B.(1)(i) through (iv) (with respect to section406(b) relief for sales or transfers in the initial issuance of certificates)would apply also to subsections I.B.(2) (with respect to section 406(b)relief for acquisitions or dispositions in the secondary market) and I.B.(3)(with respect to section 406(b) relief for the continued holding of certificatesby a plan pursuant to subsections I.B.(1) or (2)). In response to the comment,the Department has clarified subsection I.B.(2) of the exemption to makeclear that the relief contained therein is available provided that theconditions set forth in paragraphs I.B.(1)(i), (iii) and (iv) are met.11. Two commentators questioned why retroactive exemptive relief was proposedfor Salomon and First Boston as of November 1, 1985, whereas the effectivedate for Goldman Sachs' proposed exemption is January 1, 1987. In thisregard, the Department notes that Salomon and First Boston, in their respectiveapplications, requested an effective date of November 1, 1985, and thatGoldman Sachs, Inc. requested an effective date of January 1, 1987.After consideration of the entire record, the Department has determinedto grant the exemption, as modified herein.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Kay Madsen of the Department,telephone (202) 523-8194.

For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supportingthe Department's decision to grant this exemption, refer to the noticeof proposed exemption published on December 29, 1988 at 53 FR 52851. <T3>Effective Date:</T3> This exemption is effective for transactions occurringon or after November 1, 1985. <T3>Written Comments:</T3> The Department received eleven comments withregard to the proposed exemption. These are discussed below. Applicant Comments <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Summary of Facts and Representations </ITAG>The applicant has commented on or clarified certain aspects of the proposedexemption. In this regard, item 1 of the preamble to the proposed exemptionstates that the First Boston is a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Boston,Inc., a publicly traded New York Stock Exchange company. The applicantnotes that in December 1988, First Boston, Inc., merged with FinanciereCredit Suisse_First Boston, which merged company is now called CS FirstBoston, Inc., a privately held company. The applicant further notes that item 4 of the preamble to the proposedexemption states that, prior to the closing date, the sponsor acquireslegal title to all assets selected for the trust. The applicant indicatesthat in many transactions, the sponsor acquires legal title to assets selectedfor the trust on the closing date and concurrently conveys to the trustlegal title to the assets. In addition, item 4 states that certificateholders are entitled to receivemonthly or quarterly installments of principal and/or interest, or leasepayments due on the receivables. The applicant has requested that the Department clarify that the exemptionis available for the receipt of semi-annual payments by certificateholders.In this regard, the applicant represents that when payments are made onthis basis, funds are not permitted to be commingled with the servicer'sassets for longer than would be permitted for a monthly-pay security. Asegregated account is established in the name of the trustee (on behalfof certificateholders) to hold funds received between distribution dates.The account is under the sole control of the trustee, who invests the account'sassets in short-term securities which have received a rating comparableto the rating assigned to the certificates. In some cases, the servicermay be permitted to make a single deposit into the account once a month.When the servicer makes such monthly deposits, payments received from obligorsby the servicer may be commingled with the servicer's assets during themonth prior to deposit. In no event will the period of time between receiptof funds by the servicer and deposit of these funds in a segregated accountexceed one month. Furthermore, in those cases where distributions are madesemi-annually, the servicer will furnish a report on the operation of thetrust to the trustee on a monthly basis. At or about the time this reportis delivered to the trustee, it will be made available to certificateholdersand delivered to or made available to each rating agency that has ratedcertificates. After considering the applicant's comments with regard tosemi-annual payments to certificateholders, the Department has concludedthat the exemption is available for semi-annual (rather than monthly orquarterly) payments made to certificateholders, provided that the conditionsset forth in the exemption are met. With respect to item 5, the applicant notes that in some transactions fastpay/slow pay certificates may involve certificates which have the samematurities but different payment schedules.\2\\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ First Boston also has clarified that if a trust issuessubordinate certificates, holders of such subordinate certificates maynot share in the amount distributed on a pro rata basis. The Departmentnotes that the exemption does not provide relief for plan investment insuch subordinated certificates. Item 9 of the preamble to the proposed exemption states that the trustee'sfee is paid by the sponsor or servicer. The applicant notes that in sometransactions, the trustee's fee is not paid by the sponsor or servicer,but rather is paid out of trust assets. The method of compensating thetrustee will be specified in the pooling and servicing agreement and disclosedin the prospectus or private placement memorandum relating to the offeringof the certificates. The second paragraph of item 11 of the preamble to the proposed exemptionstates, that as compensation for the receivable transferred to the trust,the sponsor receives certificates representing the entire beneficial interestin the trust which it sells for cash to investors or securities underwriters.The applicant has clarified that in some transactions the sponsor may retaina portion of the certificates for its own account. In addition, the applicantnotes that in some transactions the originator may sell receivables toa trust for cash. At the time of the sale, the trustee would sell certificatesto the public or to underwriters and use the cash proceeds of the saleto pay the originator for the receivable sold to the trust. The second paragraph of item 13 states that the ``credit support fee''paid to the servicer is paid out of interest income received on the receivablesin excess of the pass-through rate. The applicant notes that in some transactionsthe ``credit support fee'' is paid in a lump sum at the time the trustis established. With respect to item 16, the applicant notes that, for some public offerings,First Boston may sell certificates on an agency basis in a best effortsunderwriting. In these cases, First Boston would receive an agency commission.The applicant further notes that in some private placements First Bostonmay buy certificates as principal, in which case its fee would consistof the difference between what it receives for the certificates that itsells and what it pays the sponsor for these certificates. Item 17 of the preamble to the proposed exemption states that the poolingand servicing agreement generally provides that the servicer may purchasea receivable included in the trust when the balance payable on the receivableis reduced to a specified percentage (usually between 5 and 10 percent)of the initial balance. The applicant has clarified that the servicer maypurchase the receivables then included in the trust when the aggregateunpaid balance on the receivables is reduced to a specified percentage(usually between 5 and 10 percent) of the initial aggregate unpaid principalbalance. Item 19 of the preamble to the proposed exemption states that where themaster servicer or its affiliate provides credit support to the trust,the master servicer, in its capacity as servicer, will first advance fundsif it determines that such advances are recoverable out of late paymentsby the obligors or amounts otherwise distributable to holders of subordinatedcertificates. Otherwise, the master servicer, as the provider of creditsupport, will be called upon to provide funds to cover such payments tothe full extent of its obligations as insurer. The applicant notes thatthe arrangement described in item 19 is the typical arrangement. However,the applicant further notes that in some transactions the master servicermay not be obligated to advance funds, but instead would be called uponto provide funds to cover defaulted payments to the full extent of itsobligations as insurer.\25\<NOTE/> Morever, the applicant notes that a master servicer typicallycan recover advances either from the provider of credit support or fromfuture payments on affected assets.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ The applicant has clarified that where the master servicerprovides credit support to the trust, it covers defaulted payments ratherthan delinquent payments as stated in item 19 of the proposed exemption.The applicant has requested the Department clarify that the conditionsset forth in paragraph (d) of item 19 apply only where the master servicerand the insurer are affiliated or are the same entity. The applicant furtherrequests clarification that, in the case of a trust that issues subordinatedcertificates which may be held by the servicer or its affiliates, the representationsreflected in this paragraph would not apply insofar as the definition ofinsurer contained in section III.I. of the proposed exemption states thata person is not an insurer solely because it holds subordinated certificates.The Department concurs with this comment. Part II of the preamble to the proposed exemption states that to be an``accredited investor'' under rule 501(a)(1) of Regulation D under theSecurities Act of 1933, a plan would need to have at least $5 million inassets, or the decision to invest in certificates would have to be madeon behalf of the plan by a bank, insurance company or an investment adviserregistered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The applicant hascommented that Rule 501(a)(1) has recently been amended to include as anaccredited investor a plan on behalf of which the investment decision ismade by a savings and loan association. In the Department's view, sucha plan would meet the requirement of subsection II.A.(6) of the exemption.Moreover, the Department contemplates that the condition contained in subsectionII.A.(6) of the exemption would be met if the investing plan is an accreditedinvestor within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1) as amended from time to time.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Proposed Exemption</ITAG>Section I.A. of the proposed exemption states that ``Section I.A. doesnot provide an exemption from the restrictions of section 406(a)(1)(E),406(a)(2) and 407 for the acquisition or holding of a certificate by anyperson who has discretionary authority or renders investment advice withrespect to the assets of an ``Excluded Plan.'' The applicant requests thatthe Department clarify that the exception applies only when such fiduciaryis purchasing or advising the purchase of a certificate for the ExcludedPlan. The Department has adopted this comment and revised Section I.A.to clarify that the exception applies where a person having discretionaryauthority or rendering investment advice to an Excluded Plan is acquiringor holding a certificate on behalf of that Excluded Plan. Moreover, theDepartment has revised section I.A. to clarify that this exemption appliesto persons rendering investment advice to an Excluded Plan within the meaningof Department regulation 2510.3-21(c), that is, rendering investment advicewhich would make them fiduciaries. The applicant has also requested certain modifications to the exemptionas proposed. Subparagraph I.B.(1)(ii) of the proposed exemption requires,with regard to section 406(b) relief for sales of certificates, that ``solelyin the case of an acquisition of certificates in connection with the initialissuance of the certificates, at least 50 percent of each class of certificatesis acquired by persons independent of members of the ``Restricted Group.''The applicant notes that the sponsor may retain 100 percent of the subordinatedclass of certificates. The applicant has requested that the Departmentclarify that paragraph I.B.(1)(ii) requires only that this condition besatisfied with respect to classes of certificates to which the exemptionapplies. In this regard, the Department notes that the preamble to theproposed exemption, in describing this provision, provided that section406(b) relief would be limited to situations where at least 50 percentof the aggregate interest in the trust is acquired by persons independentof the Restricted Group. Upon consideration of this comment, the Departmenthas determined to make two modifications to paragraph I.B.(1)(ii) of theexemption. Accordingly, under the final exemption, although the 50% testwould not apply to classes of certificates in which plans do not invest,at least 50% of the aggregate interest in the trust (including all classesof certificates issued by the trust) must be acquired by persons independentof the Restricted Group.Footnote 13 of the proposed exemption provides that ``in the case of aprivate placement memorandum, such memorandum must contain the same informationthat would be disclosed in a prospectus if the offering of the certificateswas made in a registered public offering under the Securities Act of 1933.''The applicant maintains that footnote 13 is inconsistent with the policyof the federal securities laws regarding private placements. For example,in an offering that is made only to ``accredited investors,'' there isno specific information that must be furnished to investors. Similarly,for the majority of private offerings, there is no specific informationrequired. Rather, for all offerings, investors have the protection of thefederal securities laws as well as any applicable ``Blue Sky'' and commonlaw antifraud provisions. The applicant states that the essential requirementsof these laws are that all material information regarding the offeringbe furnished or otherwise made available to each investor and that theoffering materials be free of misleading statements and omissions. In lightof the applicant's comments, the Department has determined to revise thefootnote in the exemption to provide that in the case of a private placementmemorandum, such memorandum must contain substantially the same informationthat would be disclosed in a prospectus if the offering of the certificateswere made in a registered public offering under the Securities Act of 1933.Similarly, the Department has determined to modify subsection I.C.(2) toprovide that the pooling and servicing agreement is provided to investingplans or described in all material respect in the prospectus or privateplacement memorandum. In this regard, the Department notes that the privateplacement memorandum must contain sufficient information to permit planfiduciaries to make an informed investment decision.\2\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ For purposes of clarity, the Department has substitutedthe term ``private placement memorandum'' in the final exemption for ``privateoffering memorandum'' as used in the proposed exemption.Subsection II.A.(3) of the proposed exemption conditions exemptive reliefupon the certificates acquired by the plan having received a rating thatis in one of the three highest generic rating categories from either Standardandamp; Poors Corporation (Sandamp;P's), or Moody's Investors Service, Inc.(Moody's) in the case of all certificates covered by the exemption, orDuff andamp; Phelps Inc. (Dandamp;P), if the certificates represent an interestin a trust containing obligations secured by multi-family residential orcommercial real property. As stated in footnote 7 of the preamble to theproposed exemption, it was the Department's understanding at the time ofpublication of the proposed exemption that asset-backed securities underwrittenby First Boston which are backed by assets other than multi-family residentialmortgages or commercial mortgages have been rated by either Sandamp;P's orMoody's or both. First Boston has now requested that subsection II.A.(3)and section III.B. of the proposed exemption be modified to include Dandamp;Pas an acceptable rating agency for rating all types of certificates coveredby the exemption. First Boston represents that Dandamp;P has become increasinglyactive in rating all types of asset-backed securities, including certificatesof the types described in the proposed exemption. First Boston believesthat Dandamp;P is qualified to rate these types of certificates and expectsto use Dandamp;P to rate these types of certificates in the future. Basedon First Boston's representations, and additional information submittedby Dandamp;P, the Department has determined to revise the exemption to includeDandamp;P as an acceptable rating agency for rating all types of certificatescovered by the exemption. In this regard, Dandamp;P represents that its ratingprocess with respect to all types of certificates included in the proposedexemption is similar to and consistent with that described in the preambleto the proposed exemption.\2\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\ Dandamp;P has notified the Department that it has recentlychanged its rating scale for all long-term fixed income securities, includingcertificates included in the exemption, from the numerical scale describedin the preamble to the proposed exemption to alphabetical designationswhich are consistent with the designations utilized by Sandamp;P's. As doesSandamp;P, Dandamp;P will use ``+'' and ``^'' to designate further refinementswithin a given rating category. Thus, for example, the highest rating of``Dandamp;P-1'' has been replaced with an ``AAA'' rating, ``Dandamp;P-2'' hasbeen replaced with an ``AA+'' rating, and ``Dandamp;P-7'' has been replacedwith an ``A^'' rating. Dandamp;P represents that it changed to alphabeticaldesignations to facilitate the ease of use of its ratings by investors,and that no other aspect of Dandamp;P's rating procedure will change as aresult of the new rating scale.The applicant has also requested modification of section II.B. of the proposedexemption. This section generally provides that neither any underwriter,sponsor, trustee, servicer, insurer or any obligor (assuming it is nota fiduciary with respect to the plan assets used to acquire certificates)will be subject to penalties under section 502(i) of ERISA or sections4975 (a) and (b) of the Code if the steps specified in this section aretaken to ensure that an investing plan is an accredited investor, evenif it is later determined that the plan is not an accredited investor.The applicant has expressed concern that if a plan is not an accreditedinvestor, notwithstanding that the specified steps have been taken, therelief provided by Part I of the exemption would not be available. TheDepartment has considered this comment and has determined to amend sectionII.B. of the proposed exemption be deleting ``shall be subject to the civilpenalties which may be assessed under section 501(i) of the Act, or thetaxes imposed by sections 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code,'' and by substituting``shall be denied the relief provided under Part I'' in lieu thereof.The applicant has requested clarification of the definition of ``trust''in section III.B. First, the applicant notes that pooling and servicingagreements commonly provide for the temporary investment of undistributedcash received from the servicer and held in the trust, together with thereinvestment income therein, pending distribution to certificateholdersor application to the payment of trust expenses. The applicant, therefore,has requested that subsection III.B.(3) of the proposed exemption be amendedto read as follows: ``undistributed cash, or temporary investments madetherewith maturing no later than the next distribution date; and''. Afterconsidering this suggested change, the Department has determined to modifythe exemption in the manner requested.The applicant also requests clarification that the definition of ``trust''in section III.B. of the proposed exemption would include trusts containinginterest-bearing or discount obligations secured by shares issued by acooperative housing association. After considering this comment, the Departmenthas determined to revise paragraph III.B.(1)(a) of the exemption such thatthe category of trusts containing ``secured consumer receivables that bearinterest or are purchased at a discount'' includes ``obligations securedby shares issued by a cooperative housing association.'' For purposes ofclarification, the Department has also determined to amend subsection III.B.(4)of the proposed exemption to include ``rights of the trustee under thepooling and servicing agreement.''Finally, the proposed exemption only would apply to certificates representinga beneficial ownership interest in the assets of a trust that entitle theholder to pass-through payments of principal, interest and/or other paymentsmade with respect to the assets of such trust. In commenting on the proposedexemption, the applicant requested that the Department expand the exemptionto cover certificates denominated as debt instruments and issued by a commonlaw or statutory trust which is a REMIC.\2\\8\<NOTE/> In this regard, the applicant has provided the Departmentwith further information regarding such certificates, as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ Department of Labor regulation section 29 CFR 2510.3-101clarifies the definition of ``plan assets'' for the purposes of Title Iof ERISA. In general, the regulation provides that, in the case of a plan'sinvestment in an equity interest of an entity that is neither a publicly-offeredsecurity nor a security issued by an investment company registered underthe Investment Company act of 1940, its assets include both the equityinterest and an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets ofthe entity, unless the entity is an operating company or equity participationin the entity by benefit plan investors is not significant. <ITAG tagnum="28">Regulation section 29 CFR 2510.3-101(b)(1) defines ``equity interest''to mean any interest in an entity other than an instrument that is treatedas indebtedness under applicable local law and which has no substantialequity features. The applicant is concerned that, in certain circumstances,REMIC interests in the form of debt instruments might be recharacterizedas equity interests under this regulation. </ITAG>(1) The applicant states that the decision to structure a transaction asa sale (in the case of pass-through certificates) or as a secured financing(in the case of certificates denominated as debt) is made by a REMIC issueron the basis of the accounting and other regulatory consequences to theissuer. In the absence of a specific regulatory framework (<T3>e.g., </T3>limiting debt or equity investments to a specified percentageof an investment portfolio), investors in mortgage-backed securities donot distinguish between identically rated REMIC pass-through securitiesor debt instruments because (a) the tax treatment of REMIC pass-throughsecurities and REMIC debt instruments is exactly the same, and (b) ratedREMIC debt instruments are collateralized in accordance with rating agencyguidelines and prescribed procedures so as to assure the same uninterruptedpayment stream as a similarly rated pass-through security; \2\\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\9\ In this regard, Sandamp;P's notes that the issuer's creditworthiness, if applicable, is taken into account in determining the ratingof REMIC securities. Thus, in the case of REMIC transactions structuredas a sale, the financial condition of the seller will have no impact onthe REMIC security. REMIC securities structured as debt, however, are impactedby the financial condition of the issuer. In a bankruptcy, payments wouldbe interrupted causing timing delays to investors. Additionally, a bankruptcyjudge would have the power to substitute collateral. Because of these concerns,Sandamp;P's indicates that it will only rate REMIC debt instruments in itshighest rating categories (AAA, AA) when the issuer is a special purposeentity. Such special purpose entities are created solely for the purposeof issuing highly rated debt. (2) A mortgage pass-through certificate represents a beneficial ownershipinterest in a pool of mortgages held by the trustee of a common law orstatutory trust. As explained in the preamble to the proposed exemption,the trustee contracts on behalf of certificate holders with a servicer,who undertakes to service the mortgages in accordance with the terms ofthe pooling and servicing agreement. A REMIC debt instrument, by contrast,represents the promise of an issuer to pay principal in a specified amountand interest thereon at a specified rate, secured by the pledge of a poolof mortgages (or pass-through certificates representing interests in sucha pool, as described below) which is serviced by a servicer in accordancewith the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement entered into withthe issuer, a common law or statutory trust which is the owner of the mortgages.The issuer's promise to pay the debt holders is documented in an indentureentered into by the issuer and an indenture trustee who acts on behalfof the debt holders; (3) In some cases, the issuer will issue pass-through certificates in additionto debt instruments.\3\\0\<NOTE/> Under those circumstances, investors in the REMIC debt instrumentswould have a security interest in the pass-through certificates. In othercases, the investors in REMIC debt instruments would have a security interestin ``whole'' mortgages which have not been previously securitized as pass-throughcertificates; <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\0\ In this situation, the pass-through certificates wouldbe subordinate to the debt instruments and, consequently, this exemptionwould not apply to plan investment in such pass-through certificates. (4) In the case of REMIC debt instruments, the indenture trustee will eitherbe the assignee of the issuer's interest in the pooling and servicing agreementor, if the debt instruments are secured by pass-through certificates representingbeneficial interests in the issuer (and therefore beneficial interestsin the underlying pooling and servicing agreement), the indenture trusteewill obtain a security interest in the pass-through certificates, includingrights represented thereby in the pooling and servicing agreement. As aresult, in the case of REMIC instruments denominated as debt, the indenturetrustee is responsible in the first instance for the enforcement of theservicing agreement. In consideration of the comments provided regarding REMIC debt instruments,the Department believes that it is appropriate to revise the exemptionto include such instruments, provided that they are issued by a statutoryor common law trust and that the other representations contained in thepreamble to the proposed exemption apply to these instruments (<T3>e.g., </T3>that for tax reasons the trust must be maintained as anessentially passive entity). As a result, the Department has made certainconforming changes to the final exemption, as explained below: (1) The definition of ``Certificate'' contained in subsection III.A. hasbeen expanded to include a certificate denominated as a debt instrumentthat represents an interest in a REMIC and is issued by, and is an obligationof, a trust; (2) The definition of ``Trustee'' contained in subsection III.H. has beenexpanded to include the trustee of the indenture trust, in the case ofcertificates which are denominated as debt instruments; (3) The Department has added subsection III.V. which defines ``Poolingand Servicing Agreement''. This subsection states that ``Pooling and ServicingAgreement'' means the agreement or agreements among a sponsor, a servicerand the trustee establishing a trust, and, in the case of certificateswhich are denominated as debt instruments, also includes the indentureentered into between the trustee of the trust issuing such certificatesand the indenture trustee. Miscellaneous 1. Six comments were received requesting that the Department issue a classexemption that could be utilized by other investment banking firms, banksand bank affiliates which underwrite asset-backed securities. The commentsrequesting that the Department issue a class exemption included suggestedmodifications to the proposed exemption which these commentators believeshould be made if the Department determines to issue a class exemption.In this regard, the Department notes that consideration of a class exemptionis beyond the scope of this proceeding for individual exemptive relief.Finally, the Department wishes to take the opportunity to state that thecommentators may wish to consider applications for individual relief undersection 408(a) of ERISA.  2. In addition, other commentators requested that the Department amendPTE 83-1 (48 FR 895, January 7, 1983), Class Exemption for Certain TransactionsInvolving Mortgage Pool Investment Trusts, to provide certain changes whichconform to any class or individual exemption the Department issues withrespect to asset-backed securities. With respect to these comments, theDepartment notes that amendment of PTE 83-1 is beyond the scope of thisproceeding.3. One commentator suggested that the term ``Underwriter'' as defined insubsection III.C.(3) of the proposed exemption be modified to include membersof the selling group which places certificates with investors, includingplans, even though the members of the selling group are not members ofthe underwriting syndicate. After considering this comment, and discussingthe modification with the applicant, the Department has determined to modifythe definition of underwriter in subsection III.C.(3) of the exemptionto include any member of a selling group of which First Boston or a persondescribed in subsection III.C.(2) of the exemption is a manager or co-manager.4. Two commentators requested clarification of the condition containedin subsection II.A.(2) of the proposed exemption that ``the rights andinterests evidenced by the certificates are not subordinated to the rightsand interests evidenced by other certificates of the same trust''. Thesecommentators noted that, in a common form of subordinated certificate transaction,two classes of certificates (``A'' and ``B'') are created and paymentsare shared pro rata among all certificates except that cash flow shortfallsresulting from defaults and delinquencies on the obligations in the poolare first borne by the subordinated ``B'' class. Thereafter, recoverieswith respect to such defaulted payments would be available (to the extentthat the other assets in the pool are producing sufficient cash flow tomake distributions to the A class) to make distributions to the B classto the extent of the prior losses borne by such class. These commentatorsstated that they assume that the B class would be considered ``subordinated''within the meaning of the proposed exemption and, thus, ineligible forexemptive relief. The commentators, however, requested that the Departmentclarify that the ``A'' class would not be considered subordinated merelybecause recoveries with respect to defaulted and delinquent obligationscould result in the ``B'' class receiving ``catch-up'' payments. The Departmentconcurs with the view expressed by the commentators.In addition, these commentators state that it is unclear how the ``no subordination''requirement would apply in the case of a REMIC trust in which the classA certificates described in the previous example could be further subdividedinto several classes (<T3>e.g., </T3>A-1 through A-4) with payment being made in sequence inthe classes. Defaults on the underlying obligations in the pool would firstbe absorbed by the B class. However, in the event of massive defaults (<T3>i.e., </T3>far in excess of rating agency projections) it is possiblefor the A-2 through A-4 classes to be subordinated to the prior A classesunless the governing documents provide otherwise. The commentators statethat class A-2 through A-4 certificates in such a structure should notbe treated differently from the class A-1 certificates. They further arguethat the Department should consider permitting senior certificates of thistype to qualify for relief, notwithstanding possible subordination to otherclasses of senior certificates, if another class of certificates is subordinatedto all classes of senior certificates and the certificates in questionhave achieved a high rating (<T3>e.g., </T3>one of the two highest rating categories). The Departmentdoes not believe that it has a sufficient basis upon which to provide exemptiverelief for any subordinated certificates at this time. Furthermore, theDepartment notes that the applicant has not requested such relief. Accordingly,the Department is not modifying the condition contained in subsection II.A.(2)of the proposed exemption as requested.5. Three commentators requested that the Department make clear that ``strip''and ``fast-pay/slow-pay'' certificates (described in item 5 of the preambleto the proposed exemption) would not be deemed to be subordinated merelybecause they are of classes having rights to disproportionate principalor interest payments or because they are of classes having different statedmaturities. The Department notes that, as stated in Item 5 of the preambleto the proposed exemption, the applicants have represented that in neithercase will the rights of a plan purchasing certificates be subordinatedto the rights of another certificateholder in the event of default on anyof the underlying obligations. The Department believes that the exemptionwould apply to any class of ``strip'' and ``fast-pay/slow-pay'' certificatesto which that representation applies.6. The Department received comments from Dandamp;P, Fitch Investors Services,Inc. (Fitch), and McCarthy, Crisanti andamp; Maffei, Inc. (McCarthy), eachrequesting that it be included as an acceptable rating agency for ratingall types of certificates covered by the exemption. As noted above, theapplicant requested in its comment filed with the Department that the proposedexemption be modified to include Dandamp;P as an acceptable rating agencyfor rating all types of certificates covered by the exemption, and theDepartment has determined to modify the final exemption accordingly. However,since the applicant has not requested that the Department revise the proposedexemption to include Fitch and McCarthy as acceptable rating agencies,the Department has decided that it would not be appropriate to furthermodify the exemption in this manner. The Department wishes to emphasize,however, that no implication should be drawn regarding these rating agencies,and that the Department would be willing to consider these other ratingagencies for rating certificates with regard to other asset-backed securitiesindividual exemption requests.7. Three commentators noted that the proposed exemption does not make clearwhether the certificates covered by the proposed exemption must have receivedthe requisite rating solely at the time of purchase by the plan, or whethersuch rating must be maintained while the plan holds the certificates. Thecommentators state that the exemption should specify that the rating requirementonly applies at the time the certificates are purchased by the plan. TheDepartment agrees with this comment and, accordingly, has modified subsectionII.A.(3) of the exemption to clarify that the rating condition need onlybe met at the time the certificates are acquired by the plan. In this regard,the Department notes that ERISA section 404(a)(1)(B) would require thata fiduciary act prudently in determining whether a plan should continueto hold certificates, as well as with respect to the initial decision topurchase the certificates.8. One commentator requested that the Department clarify that trusts containingassets of a type which have not been specifically considered by the Departmentwould be covered by the exemption provided that such assets satisfy thecondition set forth in section III.B. of the exemption. The Departmentagrees that the exemption would be available with respect to such trustsprovided that the condition contained in section III.B. and the other conditionsof the exemption are met.9. One commentator stated that it is not clear whether the conditions imposedby paragraphs I.B.(1)(i) through (iv) (with respect to section 406(b) relieffor sales or transfers in the initial issuance of certificates) would applyalso to subsections I.B.(2) (with respect to section 406(b) relief foracquisitions or dispositions in the secondary market) and I.B.(3) (withrespect to section 406(b) relief for the continued holding of certificatesby a plan pursuant to paragraphs I.B.(1) or (2)). In response to the comment,the Department has clarified subsection I.B.(2) of the exemption to makeclear that the relief contained therein is available provided that theconditions set forth in paragraphs I.B.(1)(i), (iii) and (iv) are met.10. Two commentators questioned why retroactive exemptive relief was proposedfor Salomon and First Boston as of November 1, 1985, whereas the effectivedate for Goldman Sachs' proposed exemption was January 1, 1987. In thisregard, the Department notes that First Boston and Salomon, in their respectiveapplications, requested an effective date of November 1, 1985, and thatGoldman Sachs, Inc., requested an effective date of January 1, 1987.After consideration of the entire record, the Department has determinedto grant the exemption, as modified herein.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Kay Madsen of the Department,telephone (202) 523-8194.
