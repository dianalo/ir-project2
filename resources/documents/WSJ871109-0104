In a Wall Street Journal survey of 213 early reporting companies, third-quarter profits from operations jumped 84% to 2.9 billion Canadian dollars ($2.2 billion), while nine-month earnings rose 59% to 8.2 billion dollars. Third-quarter earnings rose just 1% from the second period.    The reason for the profit gains continues to be outstanding profit performance in Canada's key resource sectors. Plunging oil prices last year forced Canadian oil companies to pare costs drastically and they have emerged as lean as the mining and forest companies, which underwent the same process a few years ago. The result is a resource sector enjoying higher prices but operating with much lower break-even levels.    However, the stock market crisis of the past few weeks &quot;meaningfully changes the economic outlook,&quot; said Paul Kovacs, senior economist at investment dealer Burns Fry Ltd. &quot;The pace of economic growth will be slower in all major industrial countries, which is definitely negative for corporate profits overall.&quot;    Mr. Kovacs said he has lowered his forecast for growth in Canadian gross national product in 1988 to a 2%-to-2.5% range from 3%. He said the sectors that are most vulnerable in the next year are those that enjoyed the biggest run-ups in the past four years. &quot;We're predicting an absolute decline in car sales, home-building activity and consumer durables.&quot;    But Mr. Kovacs noted that, with &quot;such terrific profit growth and good momentum&quot; preceding the market upheaval, it's difficult to predict the actual timing of a slowdown in economic growth. &quot;We're much less optimistic now than a few weeks ago,&quot; but he doesn't see a major recession on the horizon.    The best profit rise was shown by 19 oil and gas concerns, which saw earnings rise more than fourfold to 531.1 million dollars in the quarter and more than double to 1.47 billion dollars in the nine months. Big winners in the quarter were Imperial Oil Ltd., 70%-owned by Exxon Corp., whose profit nearly tripled to 218 million dollars ($165.1 million) while Shell Canada Ltd., 79%-owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, saw its profit rise about sixfold to 94 million dollars.    In Canada's important forest-products sector, third-quarter profits of 17 firms doubled to 400.1 million dollars while nine-month earnings more than doubled to 1.09 billion dollars. The third quarter marked the eighth period in a row of higher year-to-year profits for this industry as continuing strong demand has permitted price increases for both wood and paper products. The price and volume increases have kept the industry's profits growing despite the 7% increase in the Canadian dollar against its U.S. counterpart over the past year, which has partly reduced Canadian firms' profits in foreign-exchange translation.    For 22 mining concerns, third-quarter earnings rose more than fourfold to 233.9 million dollars while nine-month profits were up more than threefold to 520.9 million dollars. Prices for most metals traditionally strengthen late in the business cycle and this time around has been no exception. Inco Ltd.'s third-quarter net rose to $41.4 million from $3 million as its averaged realized nickel price was $2.27 a pound, up from $2 a year earlier. Noranda Inc. had latest-quarter profit of 89.5 million dollars, up from just 4.7 million dollars a year earlier.    Profits for 51 industrial-products companies rose 81% to 479.6 million dollars in the quarter and 40% to 1.31 billion dollars in the nine months. The profit gains are largely due to big improvements by two of the group's biggest members. Alcan Aluminium Ltd.'s quarterly profit more than doubled to $122 million and AMCA International Ltd. had third-quarter profit of $5 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $56.2 million. Meanwhile, telecommunications giant Northern Telecom Ltd. posted just a 5% profit rise to $69.5 million.    Profits showed good gains in the publishing and financial-services sectors and were slightly ahead for consumer-products concerns. Utilities posted flat results, while retailers had generally lower earnings. </TEXT></DOC>
