Miller III speaking on June 15 before the United Shareholders Association:    The next time you hear someone refer to a &quot;hostile takeover,&quot; ask them two questions: One, &quot;would you view someone's making you a great offer on, say, your house, as a hostile act?&quot; Two, &quot;who owns companies -- managers or shareholders?&quot; If they think an offer to buy is a hostile act, they've got emotional problems. If they think managers own firms, they haven't been to high school. If they answer both questions correctly, ask them not to embarrass themselves in the future by referring to &quot;hostile takeovers.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
