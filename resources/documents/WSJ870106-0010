As a region, it tends to have high labor costs, high rates of unionization and, for managers who care about such things, a lot less sun than balmier areas of the U.S. This costs points in most business-climate ratings.    Taking a &quot;don't get mad, get even&quot; stance, AmeriTrust Co., a Cleveland bank-holding company, has come up with a study of its own. All of a sudden, the Rust Belt looks like a pretty good place to run a company.    The AmeriTrust survey is a none-too-subtle slap at a controversial, widely quoted annual ranking of state business climates published by the Grant Thornton accounting firm. This study uses criteria developed by state manufacturers' groups, with business costs being by far the biggest rating factor.    Under Grant Thornton's scoring system, low-cost states such as South Dakota, Utah and Florida vault to the top of the list over states in the manufacturing mainstream, such as Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and California. The Grant Thornton front-runners haven't been bashful in exploiting the survey results.    FLORIDA MADE its first-place finish in three consecutive years the centerpiece of its economic-development advertising in the early 1980s. South Dakota, No. 1 by a wide margin the past two years, has produced an ad showing a cowboy with a smoking pistol and the legend: &quot;We blew 'em away!&quot;    This &quot;We're No. 1!&quot; chortling grates on the nerves of the Grant Thornton also-rans. &quot;South Dakota isn't necessarily the best place in the country to put all your chips in,&quot; says Jerry Jarrett, chairman of AmeriTrust, whose banking backyard is the industrial belt bordering the Great Lakes.    He calls the Grant Thornton rating system a &quot;narrow vision of the American economy (that) overlooks the more complex needs of many changing and new industries.&quot; The accounting firm's rating system &quot;just concentrates on costs at the expense of quality. There are other things that should be in the pot.&quot;    At Mr. Jarrett's behest, SRI International of Menlo Park, Calif., developed a new rating system. It glosses over business costs and focuses instead on three areas: availability of skilled labor and investment capital, and something SRI calls &quot;access to technology.&quot;    THE TWO WAYS of assessing business environments differ sharply. Grant Thornton gives high marks to states that are stingy with workers' compensation benefits, that hold down required spending for pollution control, and that have little lost working time due to labor strikes.    A perfectly acceptable approach &quot;if you want to measure where to get envelopes stuffed cheapest,&quot; says Steven Waldhorn, the SRI economist who directed the AmeriTrust study.    Manufacturers should really be worrying about their ability to adapt to new technology and to react to shifting patterns of world trade, Mr. Waldhorn says. The AmeriTrust/SRI ranking system reflects this strategic approach by considering such factors as the number of patents issued per capita, state and local spending on education, the percentage of college graduates, and whether a state has a venture-capital fund and allows branch banking.    AmeriTrust also resists the urge to produce a best-to-worst list of individual states as Grant Thornton does. Instead, its survey rates regions in 21 categories. There is no overall regional business-climate winner. &quot;We didn't try to skew this thing,&quot; Mr. Jarrett, the bank chairman, says. &quot;We didn't select the indices to make the Midwest look good.&quot;    IN FACT, New England looks to be best of the lot, based largely on the strength of its individual states in higher education, research and development and state financial assistance.    The Industrial Midwest shines in the amount of money industry commits to research and development and the quality of its science and engineering faculty. It is in the bottom third, ranked against other regions, in the percentage of college graduates and in Randamp;D funds spent by colleges and universities. The states included here are Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin. All finished in the bottom half in the latest Grant Thornton survey. Michigan was dead last.    While stressing regional performance, AmeriTrust's survey summary saves a few choice words for South Dakota. In technology ratings such as research articles per faculty member and science and engineering Ph.D.s per capita, &quot;South Dakota's rankings are among the lowest in the nation,&quot; the report says.    It's worth asking if companies pay the least bit of attention to the ratings when choosing where to expand their business. Mr. Waldhorn of SRI thinks people are &quot;probably oversensitive&quot; to how their localities stack up against the competition.    But in the major debate under way over how to make the U.S. economy more competitive, Mr. Waldhorn says governors and state economic officials are chewing on the issues raised in the AmeriTrust survey -- technology, labor and capital -- and not on which state has the smallest change in its unionized work force.    &quot;There are parts of the country that will always try to drive their economies on branch plants, but our reading is that this is a very small part of job creation,&quot; Mr. Waldhorn says.    Adds Mr. Jarrett: &quot;It's one way to make sure that other areas of the country aren't ignored.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
