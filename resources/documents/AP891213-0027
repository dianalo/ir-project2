(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Workers digging a sewer line found bonesof animals dating back from the ice age.   William Orr, a geology professor at the University of Oregon andcurator of its Thomas Condon Collection of Fossils, brought sixbones from the site to the Woodburn City Council meeting Monday.   ``I'm here to generate enthusiasm for a summer dig,'' he said.``My grad students say I rarely get excited about anything, but I'mexcited about this.''   Orr said the bones were the best representation of ice-agemammals he had seen in a quarter-century of teaching. The boneswere found 6 to 9 feet below ground and are 30,000 to 50,000 yearsold, Orr said.   He said the crew's discovery was typical. ``Most major findshappen this way,'' Orr said.
