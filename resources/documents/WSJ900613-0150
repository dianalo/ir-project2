As part of that strategy, the House Democratic leadershipplans to unveil a package of legislation as early as thisweek to boost U.S. commercial technology, including HDTV. Thebill, according to lawmakers and staffers, would create anational commission to plot a strategy on HDTV and provide$50 million in Pentagon funding for the technology.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, the package earmarks $100 million for a newCommerce Department program in such advanced technologies asHDTV, and $200 million in loan guarantees for smallbusinesses doing high-technology work and for U.S. firmsexporting technology products.   The technology initiative, put together by House MajorityLeader Richard Gephardt, (D., Mo.), and Rep. Norman Mineta(D., Calif.), packages a variety of bills and budgetresolutions that have already been introduced, but haven'tbecome law. For instance, a House-passed bill that encouragesthe formation of joint production ventures is part of thepackage.   &quot;If you have seven separate bills, the president can pickyou apart,&quot; says Rep. Mineta. &quot;If you have one bill, he maylike six parts, and it will be harder to veto.&quot; Nevertheless,the funding sought in the bill will likely be pared backbecause of expected administration opposition and because ofpressure on the appropriations committees to reduce spending.   Meanwhile, the HDTV counterattack advanced on two otherfronts yesterday. The Office of Technology Assessment, aresearch arm of Congress, released a report calling HDTVcrucial for &quot;a number of technologies that will be importantto future generations of computer and communicationsequipment.&quot; Another report by Lester Thurow, dean of theMassachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School ofManagement, railed at the administration for failing toinvest in HDTV and other commercial technologies.   &quot;If the administration persists in this attitude,&quot; Mr.Thurow wrote in a report released by Rebuild America, a grouptied to Rep. Mel Levine, (D., Calif.), &quot;the U.S. could be asecond- or third-rate industrial power in the year 2000, andPresident Bush will be remembered as the Herbert Hoover ofU.S. industrial competitiveness.&quot;   HDTV refers to a host of new technologies aimed atproducing video displays with super-sharp images and sound.The first sets are expected to go on sale in Japan next yearand cost at least $5,000. They would be marketed in Europeafter that, and in the U.S. in the mid-1990s. Prices wouldsurely drop as sales pick up. Offshoots of the technologywould be used to make wall-sized displays and computerscreens.   The technology also has come to symbolize an increasinglybitter debate over the proper role of government in nurturingcommercial technology. The administration has taken ahands-off approach, figuring that U.S. companies shoulddecide how to invest funds without guidance or money from thegovernment. But critics consider that view naive, given thatJapanese and European governments are spending heavily toprotect their electronics and other high-tech industries.   The OTA report and an unpublished study by a Pentagonmanufacturing panel detail the heavy HDTV investment madeabroad. While the U.S. government and industry have probablyspent about $100 million on HDTV research, Japan BroadcastingCo. and other Japanese government agencies have invested $400million in HDTV research, and private industry has addedbetween $670 million and $1.3 billion, the Pentagon reportestimates. Japan Broadcasting has divided HDTV researchprojects among Japanese firms, while other governmentagencies have provided low-interest loans and tax breaks.   Moreover, the OTA report says, the Japanese government hasa new $100 million initiative, called the Giant ElectronicsProject, to develop a 40-inch video display by 1996 that'snot much thicker than a picture frame. The Pentagon reportestimates that Japanese firms are spending $1.3 billiondeveloping flat-panel displays of various sizes. Electronicsanalysts in the U.S. and abroad consider the development ofbig flat panels to be crucial for the success of HDTV becausethe bigger picture size shows off the technology's detail.   In Europe, countries have banded into an HDTV venturecalled Eureka Project 95. The first phase of project, whichended in December, cost $318 million, the OTA report says.European governments chipped in 40% of the cost.   Japan has been pushing to get its system adopted as aworld standard, with Europe so far successfully blocking itsattempts. Politics is more important than technology in thiseffort. An international technical group organized by theSoviet Union recently compared Japanese and European systemsfor producing HDTV programming. In an interim report, datedJune 4, and provided to this newspaper, the Japanese systemwas rated superior &quot;mainly because it was free fromlarge-area flicker.&quot; Further tests are planned. The SovietUnion organized the test to help it decide which system tochoose.   In the U.S., meanwhile, the HDTV effort has beenfractured, with the Bush administration repeatedly turningback efforts to increase funding for research. Congressrecently freed $20 million in additional HDTV funding for thePentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa),on top of $10 million already approved. But that smallvictory has as much to do with pork-barrel politics as withtechnology policy.   Rep. John Murtha, (D., Penn.), chairman of the defenseappropriations subcommittee, pushed for the additional fundslargely to help a small Pittsburgh company, MagnascreenCorp., congressional staffers say. Magnascreen has alreadybeen awarded a $1 million Darpa contract to produce aflat-panel TV, and according to Pentagon documents, could winas much as $9.5 million of the additional funds.   But turning the U.S. into an HDTV competitor would takefar more money than that. Darpa has said it could use $100million annually to research flat-panel displays, and thePentagon report recommends that level of funding. But theadministration has fought to keep HDTV funding to a fractionof that, and the Pentagon ousted the Darpa director, CraigFields, who lobbied for big increases.</TEXT></DOC>
