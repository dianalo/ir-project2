(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rob Russell eased into the gun turret,adjusting his helmet and closing the hatch over his head. As hisbuddy, Nels Anderson, positioned their tank, Russell reached forhis ammunition _ a bucket of racquetballs.   As he took aim at another tank, the high school freshman joinedhundreds of others in what has become this summer's hottestamusement park attraction _ Tank Tag.   ``It's addictive,'' said Russell, 14, of Sudbury, as he andAnderson prepared for their sixth ride in the tanks at the MillburyAmusement Center, about 35 miles west of Boston.   ``It's a lot more realistic than a computer game,'' saidAnderson, 33, a computer programmer from Framingham, ``and youcan't get hurt.''   The country's newest war game has sprung up at about 20amusement parks, including ones in Orlando, Fla., Myrtle Beach,S.C., Wildwood, N.J., and San Diego, and dozens of others areexpected to follow suit.   Tank Tag's popularity has soared since it surfaced in Allentown,Pa., last summer. It was invented by Robert Plarr, president ofDorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown.   ``It's like being in World War II without getting hurt,'' saidPlarr. ``It's just like the gladiators in Roman times. This is thefirst time in history you're part of a shooting gallery.''   More than 150 amusement park owners from around the world havescheduled visits to the Allentown facility this month to inspectTank Tag as a potential attraction for their own parks, accordingto Plarr. He said a group of South Koreans visited last week to seeif they could install Tank Tag and a water war game at some of theformer Olympic Games sites in Seoul.   Plarr, a former Marine who addresses everyone as ``sir'' or``ma'am,'' expanded his basic tank game idea to the water games.   The tag game uses two to four small-scale, computerized,made-to-order tanks that are mounted on tires instead of treads andpowered by hydraulic Honda engines.   The tanks, which Plarr says cost from $20,000 to $40,000 each,are designed for two people _ one who ``drives'' the tank bypressing a gas-powered pedal on the floor and the other seated inthe turret. Each pays $4.50 a ride.   The game includes 10 simulated guns placed along the perimeterof the Tank Tag area. Participants who choose not to ride on thetanks can stay behind the protective netting and fire balls, paidfor by the bucket, at the tanks.   The balls shot from a tank turret or from one of the outsideguns can go at 60 mph.   ``I think it's kind of cute,'' said Vicki Suhl, 38, who watchedher son, Josh, 9, fire at the tanks from the perimeter. ``It's abigger version of Nintendo.''   The only restriction on participants is height _ you must be atleast 4{ feet tall to crawl inside a tank.   In Allentown, more than 50 percent of the participants are womenand children, said Plarr.   Plarr avoids comment on the paramilitary aspects of Tank Tag. Heprefers to view the game as the heir to the carnival shootinggallery of the past and as testament to a new demand forparticipatory games.   ``People want to touch, feel, taste. They don't want to be putin a car. They want to drive themselves,'' said Plarr. ``This is ado-it-yourself ride.''</TEXT></DOC>
