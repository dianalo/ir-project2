(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A year after being disgraced by chargesof sexual misconduct, evangelist Jimmy Swaggart portrays his plightas a life-and-death struggle against ``pornographers'' who aretrying to topple his TV ministry.   ``This is the crisis point in this ministry. Satan has come at uswith his mightiest blow. He has not succeeded. He will notsucceed,'' Swaggart said last weekend on his hourlong televisionprogram.   Swaggart said that without an influx of donations, his televisionministry will leave the air Feb. 26 _ a year and five days after hetearfully confessed from the pulpit to an unspecified sin.   It's been a long year for Swaggart's ministry, which had seemedto be on top of the evangelical world after the fall of PTL's JimBakker.   Shortly after Swaggart's confession to his congregation, NewOrleans prostitute Debra Murphree said he had paid her to pose nudefor him, a claim she repeated for a Penthouse magazine article.   Swaggart originally agreed not to preach for three months, inaccordance with a recommendation from the Assemblies of God statecouncil, but resigned from the Pentecostal denomination afternational leaders demanded that he stay away from the pulpit at leasta year. At the same time Swaggart resigned, the Assemblies dismissedhim.   Although the ministry refused to reveal specifics of its ensuingfinancial plight as donations dropped, Swaggart held a telethon toraise money to stay afloat; laid off employees from his ministry,one of Baton Rouge's major employers; called off construction plans;and put the ministry's jet up for sale.   Once the highest-rated television preacher with viewershipestimated at more than 2 million, Swaggart was dropped from threemajor cable television networks. His Family Worship Center, whichseats 5,000 and was filled to the rafters for his confession, nowdisplays signs informing worshipers that its large balcony is closed.   The Assemblies of God said it would revoke credentials ofministers who remained part of Swaggart's organization, and at leasttwo churches were formed in the Baton Rouge area by ministers wholeft Swaggart. Many faculty left Swaggart's Bible college,enrollment dropped, and some graduates last spring wondered aloud iftheir diplomas could be changed to eliminate reference to theevangelist.   Nevertheless, around Thanksgiving, Swaggart told his congregationthat the ministry had turned the corner. His television programbegan broadcasts to China in January.   Throughout, Swaggart remained mum about Murphree's claim. But hebroke his silence last month when a New Orleans stripper, CatherineMary Kampen, made similar allegations, and, like Murphree, sold herstory to Penthouse.   ``There is not one shred of truth to these allegations. I havenever met or seen this woman,'' he said. The ministry promised alibel lawsuit and said it had evidence Kampen made up theallegations, though she and Penthouse said they stood by the story.   ``This is a crime. It is a filth that must be eradicated from theland,'' Swaggart said during a Jan. 30 news conference in which hedeclared war on ``pornographers.''   Two days later, Swaggart warned his congregation that anotherplot to subvert his ministry might be in the works, ``aspreposterous as this one. ... If you have enough money, you can getanyone to say anything.'' Then came the threat a week ago to haltthe TV ministry unless enough donations come in.   On Wednesday night, Swaggart said his followers were respondingto his plea for money, ``but I don't want to shout too much becausethere are newsmen here and they might think we're rich.'' Swaggartsaid he had met several times with ``one of the world's foremostlawyers.''   For now, Swaggart says his followers must decide.   ``You are making a choice today, a choice between thepornographers that are working more diligently than you will everknow ... or it's us. It's either the devil or darkness or it's Godand light.''</TEXT></DOC>
