U.S. companies continue to buildand operate production facilities and make other &quot;direct&quot;investments in Asia, but their role has been overshadowed.Much of the new foreign direct investment money comes fromthe region itself: from Japan; from the so-called fourdragons, the newly industrializing economies of Hong Kong,Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea; and even from thedeveloping countries themselves.   &quot;Almost every developing country in Asia is investingoverseas. It's not confined to the four dragons,&quot; SanjayaLall, an economist at England's Oxford University, told theround table, which took place here recently. The four dragonstogether invest almost as much as Japan, he said.   The growing &quot;regionalization&quot; of foreign direct investmentin Asia was one of the two main themes of the meeting,sponsored by the United Nations Development Program, Hawaii'sEast-West Center and the World Bank's Foreign InvestmentAdvisory Service. It drew 47 participants from 21 countries.   The round table's second main theme was related to thefirst: Because Asian countries are increasingly investing inother Asian countries, foreign direct investment in Asia islikely to continue expanding in the 1990s, even if U.S. andEuropean investors are preoccupied elsewhere. SomeAsian-Pacific countries will draw much more investment thanothers, and the magnitude of the expansion will depend inpart on developments in the region's two giant question-markcountries, India and China. But participants generally agreedthat the outlook for Asia as a whole looks bright.   &quot;We are agreeing that the flows of {foreign investment} toAsian countries will continue to increase in the decade ofthe '90s,&quot; said Mr. Weigel of the World Bank. &quot;There wasn't alot of pessimism.&quot;   According to statistics presented by Hal Hill, aneconomist at Australian National University in Canberra,foreign direct investment flows world-wide quadrupled to$149.89 billion between 1983 and 1988. The U.S. absorbed 42%of the global flows during the five-year period, but foreigndirect investment in Asia almost tripled, to $12.7 billion in1988. Asia's share of the global total overtook LatinAmerica's, 8.6% to 8.3%. And even though Asia's share for thefirst time included China, which began receiving sizableforeign investment only during the 1980s, that didn't preventbig increases in investments in countries such as Thailandand Malaysia.   Admittedly, the 1990s could be less buoyant in some ways.Investment from Japan will continue at a high level, but maynot grow much overall, Hajime Ohta, an official of theJapanese business group Keidanren, told the round table.   Big European companies will continue to invest in theregion, but with European unification and the emergence ofopportunities in East Europe, most attention will be rivetedcloser to home. Moreover, if the U.S. signs a free-tradeagreement with Mexico next year, some U.S., European,Japanese and Asian companies might build factories in Mexicoto take advantage of its new access to the U.S. market. Someof those factories might otherwise have been built in Asia.   All that competition doesn't necessarily mean declininginvestment in Asia. But round-table participants saidcountries eager for foreign direct investment may have towork harder to attract it, by deregulating, holding downinflation, dropping protectionist barriers and pursuing othersound economic policies.   &quot;Getting the policy mix right will matter more in the '90sthan in the '80s, because there will be more competition,&quot;said Ulrich Hiemenz of Germany's Kiel Institute for WorldEconomics. Signs of that competition popped up in Honolulu.Tomas Alcantara, the Philippines' Undersecretary for Industryand Investment, admitted that Thailand has been getting muchmore Japanese investment, &quot;and this has caused us to reflecton the reasons why.&quot;   Thailand, Mr. Alcantara theorized, got a &quot;five-year headstart&quot; because the Philippines was embroiled in politicalturmoil in 1985, when the yen's value surged and forcedJapanese manufacturers to locate plants in Southeast Asia. Inaddition, the Japanese &quot;are very comfortable with Thaiworkers because of the religious links. They say, `TheBuddhists don't strike. The Catholics {of the Philippines}do.'&quot;   But foreign direct investment in the Philippines hasdoubled every year since 1987, Mr. Alcantara said, and bigJapanese factories are under construction or startingoperations. To attract even more investors, the Philippinescontinues to liberalize its economic and foreign-investmentpolicies. &quot;We look at the {investment} pie as not getting anybigger. In fact, it could get smaller,&quot; Mr. Alcantara said.If China, for example, succeeds in improving its investmentenvironment, &quot;China could be a competitor with thePhilippines.&quot;   China and India were the big unknown variables throughoutmuch of the discussion. If either were to become a moreattractive place to invest, foreign money could pour in.India, in particular, could become a magnet for investment&quot;if it gets its policy mix right,&quot; said Nissim Ezekiel, anadviser to the World Bank's International Finance Corp. Withits huge domestic market and labor force and its developedprivate business and financial sectors, India could absorbforeign investment faster than other countries that havediscouraged foreign investment.   The question is, will India decide it really wants foreigninvestment? &quot;Where I come from, the question of whether{foreign investment} is a good thing is still being debated,&quot;said Hari Shankar Singhania, a New Delhi businessman.   China, according to Citic Trading Inc. President XuShiwei, is eager for foreign investment, and received $17.7billion in investment between 1979 and last September.Although U.S., European and Japanese investors moved quicklyinto China in the early 1980s, investors from Hong Kong,Taiwan and other Asian countries dominated the latter half ofthe decade. Currently, Mr. Xu said, more than 70% of China'sforeign direct investment comes from such countries. WhileChina wants more high-technology investments, most of theAsian investors have taken advantage of China's cheap laborto invest in such labor-intensive industries as textiles.   The question for China is whether foreign companies willever find it an attractive site for investment. &quot;China isn'tas difficult as you think it is -- it's even more difficult,&quot;said Gordon Wu, a Hong Kong businessman who invests heavilyin China. But Mr. Wu said money could be made in China, andinvestment would continue to flow in from those whounderstand China, particularly overseas Chinese.   Keidanren's Mr. Ohta also suggested that at least someJapanese would continue to invest in China, in part becauseof the long-term market potential of its population of 1.1billion, and in part out of concern for &quot;political stability&quot;in Japan's giant continental neighbor.</TEXT></DOC>
