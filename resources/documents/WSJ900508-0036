The Agriculture Department confirmed that the Soviets hadpurchased 1,750,000 metric tons of corn. But grain expertsspeculate that the Soviets needed Japanese credit to pull offthe deals, another sign of Moscow's eroding reputation as areliable and savvy trader.</LP><TEXT>   Last fall, the Soviet Union took the unusual step ofasking for short-term credit to buy U.S. crops; ittraditionally had paid cash. Then this spring, it beganhaving problems providing collateral to back the credit, andsome U.S. grain merchants temporarily stopped taking newbusiness. New York-based Continental Grain Co., for example,stayed on the sidelines during the bidding on one shipment ofwheat to the Soviets.   Around three weeks ago came the first reports that theSoviets had to turn to Japanese trading firms for credit tofinance U.S. purchases. More recently, there have beenwidespread reports that the Soviets are falling behind onpayments to Western companies for everything from steel towool.   According to U.S. grain industry officials, Soviet buyingis being hampered by internal confusion over therestructuring of the Soviet bureaucracy and economy. Moscowalso has been pinched by flat prices for oil and gold, twocommodities it sells as a source of currency for importinggoods.   The Soviet cash crunch might get worse in the wake ofMoscow's announcement that it is boosting the price it paysto Soviet grain farmers an average of 50%.   The move is intended to boost domestic production, whichwould reduce its dependency on foreign grain, but in the nearterm the Soviet budget deficit would balloon.   Last fall, tremors rippled through the world grain marketswhen Moscow unveiled an unusual program to reward Sovietwheat farmers who exceed production goals. Traders wereworried that the Soviets might have to trim spending onimports in order to finance the domestic wheat-growingincentives. Because of inefficient growing practices andstaggering losses due to spoilage, the Soviet Union is one ofthe largest importers of food.   The Soviet Union still carries considerable clout. It isone of the biggest buyers of U.S. crops, and most grainindustry officials and traders insist on anonymity whendiscussing the Soviet Union's murky financial woes.   Indeed, the Soviet problems so far haven't had anoticeable effect on grain prices in the U.S. The Japanesecredit is probably enough to allow the Soviets to finishtheir grain purchases before the summer, which is when Sovietgrain imports dwindle as its own crops matures, said BillBiedermann, director of research at Allendale Inc. insuburban Chicago.   At the Chicago Board of Trade, prices of corn futurescontracts for May delivery rose 3.5 cents a bushel to settleat $2.9075 a bushel. Prices of soybean and wheat futurescontracts also rose sharply amid heavy buying by commodityfunds and futures brokerage firms.   Despite its payment problems, the Soviet Union is managingto keep pace with last year's hefty level of corn purchases.Since October, Moscow has agreed to buy roughly 15.6 millionmetric tons of U.S. corn. The Soviet record is roughly 16million metric tons, purchased in the year ended Sept. 30,1989.   The Soviet credit problems, however, are strengtheningcalls for the U.S. to grant it most-favored-nation tradingstatus, which would make it eligible for preferentialtreatment and credits from Washington.   The severity of the Soviet credit problems isn't clear,but they are affecting many of its imports. The Soviet Unionis reportedly asking the major wool-producing nations ofAustralia, New Zealand, Argentina and Uruguay to extendcredit on purchases.   The New Zealand Council of Wool Exporters said its membershalted shipments to the Soviets because of unpaid billstotaling $30 million. The Australian Wool Exporters Councilsaid the Soviets owe its members more than 100 millionAustralian dollars (US$75.6 million) for wool that has beenshipped and another A$50 million for wool that has beenordered.   The group said it received a telex from Novoexport, theSoviet Union's import agency, requesting an extension ofcredit.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices were mixed in light activity, inpart because London markets were closed for a bank holiday.The soonest-to-expire July and October contracts, which haveno trading limits and fell more than one cent a pound Friday,recovered slightly. The July contract rose 0.16 cent a poundto 14.60 cents and October advanced 0.06 cent to 14.56 cents.More deferred contracts, however, whose declines wererestricted Friday by trading limits of 0.50 cent a pound,continued to fall and were off 0.28 cent to 0.30 cent.Friday's shakeout reflects growing pessimism that worlddemand won't be sufficient to cause shortages of sugar,according to Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton,New York. &quot;Such concerns come after a long absence of buyingfrom China and India, both of which had been expected to havesubstantial import needs earlier in the year,&quot; Ms. Kaul said.She noted that news reports cited ample supplies of sugar inChina and expectations of record production in India. Thesereports further fueled pessimism about prices, she said.However, Chinese officials still cited the need to importabout two million tons of sugar, but no purchases have beenmade, Ms. Kaul said. In India, officials have yet to rule outthe possibility of imports, as even with record output only asmall surplus will remain at the end of this season, shenoted. Ms. Kaul said that in her view, &quot;the timing of suchreports in the wake of Friday's sharp break indicates thesepotential purchasers may be trying to push prices down toeven lower levels before making purchases.&quot; Separately, theCoffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange said that Friday's tradingvolume in the world sugar contract amounted to a record81,320 contracts, topping the previous record of 59,989contracts, set on July 6, 1989. Shearson's Ms. Kaul observedthat the total open interest, or the number of contractsoutstanding that remain to be liquidated by either anopposite trade or delivery of the commodity, fell only 7,431contracts to 178,026 contracts. She said this indicated that,while some fresh buying may have been attracted by thedecline, many traders liquidated long positions and wentshort, or sold contracts in anticipation that prices will goeven lower. This situation could set the stage for apotential rebound if these short sellers have to cover, orbuy back, their positions, Ms. Kaul said.                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil prices rose, largely on news that amajor pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico was closed down as aresult of a leak. West Texas Intermediate for June deliveryrose 29 cents a barrel to close at $18.27 in trading on theNew York Mercantile Exchange. Already, production of 95,000barrels a day has been halted from platforms owned by severalmajor U.S. energy companies, according to a spokesman forTexaco Inc., which operates the pipeline. It's unclear howmuch of an impact the spill from the pipeline, which has acapacity of 125,000 barrels a day, will ultimately have onpricing. Texaco says that it doesn't yet know how long thepipeline will be shut down. Divers were on their way to thescene to try and determine where the break might haveoccurred. Texaco said that about 900 barrels of crude oilhave spilled into the Gulf's waters. Early indicationssuggest that the 20-inch pipeline is the source. The pipeserves 36 production platforms in the area. Texaco hasaccepted responsibility for the cleanup and as of lateyesterday there was one skimmer ship on the scene. Otherswere expected to arrive within hours. The spill covers anarea at least five miles wide by 20 miles long.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices eased in quiet trading. The Julycontract fell 1.60 cents a pound to $1.0965. The softer toneto the market reflected the return to work of Southern PeruCopper Corp. employees in Peru, said Fred Demler, metalseconomist for PaineWebber Inc. in New York. The miners andsmelter employees resumed work Friday in compliance with agovernment order that threatened them with the loss of theirjobs if they didn't return, Mr. Demler noted. However,management and unions will resume their negotiationstomorrow, he said. A three-day sympathy strike by Peruvianminers was scheduled to start yesterday, but as the SouthernPeru employees have returned, the strike was canceled,according to Mr. Demler. Bullish factors in the market, henoted, are that inventories of copper still remain low,world-wide demand for the metal continues strong, and laborcontracts with U.S. and Canadian copper companies arescheduled to expire at the end of June. The approach ofnegotiations and the possibility of strikes are likely tocreate concern about production disruptions, Mr. Demler said.</TEXT></DOC>
