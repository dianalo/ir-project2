After a severe tax-related selloff late last year, the mostly small-company OTC stocks took off. The Nasdaq industrial index rose 14% in the first 11 trading days of January, compared with a 9% gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    And even that understates the recent strength of many OTC market sectors. Some OTC stock groups have risen 25% or more this year, and dozens of individual stocks -- particularly small ones -- have jumped more than 40%.    &quot;In the last half of last year, my portfolio was sagging badly,&quot; says Glenn Cutler, editor of Market Mania, a California-based newsletter for small investors, &quot;but I've made it all back and more in the last six days.&quot;    Another Nasdaq indicator, the composite index, could break a record for its biggest January gain in the 12 years that the National Association of Securities Dealers has been keeping statistics on it. The record, a 12.7% gain, was set in January 1985.    That month's surge accounted for 40% of the entire year's gain in the composite index. In several other years, too, January's rise in the index has turned out to be a substantial portion of the year's gain. Even last year, when the OTC composite rose just 3.3%, the full year's advance was 7.4% -- meaning that January provided 45% of the gain.    Through most of last year, the OTC market underperformed the Dow Jones industrials and other indexes of larger stocks. But individuals' buying, a bigger factor in the OTC than on the exchanges, has produced the current classic January surge.    Computers, medical instruments and most other technology sectors are among those outperforming the overall OTC averages, with gains of 20% and more. But the superstars now are groups that had been seriously depressed, such as oil-field services, telecommunications equipment and makers of computer parts such as microchips and disk drives.    Lone Star Technologies Inc., the largest oil and gas services company in the OTC market, has moved up 20% this year to close Friday at $7.50 a share. QED Exploration Inc., one of the tiniest in this area, is up 32% at $4.125 a share.    And although the small OTC oil exploration and production companies haven't shown the kind of price gains posted in the past week or so by big oil companies, there have been a few bright spots.    Hadson Corp., an Oklahoma City-based exploration company with market capitalization of $93 million, has jumped 31% to $7.375 a share; American Exploration Co., Houston, with a $36 million capitalization, is up 40% at $3.50. Both are currently acquiring oil and gas properties.    In the telecommunications equipment area, Sensormatic Electronics Corp., one of the largest, is up 21% at $11.75 a share; KLA Instruments Corp. is up 37% at $18.625; and a small issue, Margaux Controls Inc., is up 30% at $3.25.    Just as the performances of the biggest OTC stocks don't tell the full story, neither do the National Association of Securities Dealers' indexes, which are weighted for market capital and thus emphasize the larger stocks. Market capital is the number of shares outstanding times the current price. At present, the small OTC stocks, with market capital of $25 million to $50 million, are making the best showings, followed by the largest ones.    Some OTC niches with lots of small stocks, such as film and video makers, casinos and gambling-related stocks, and small-scale gold and even coal mining operations, have risen greatly. Mills-Jennings Co., a $6 million market capitalization company based in Reno, Nev., that makes slot machines, has jumped 41% in price in nine days to $9.50 a share. American Sports Advisors Inc., Garden City, N.Y., which publishes handicapping sheets on sports events, has doubled in price to 12.5 cents a share.    Apple Computer Inc., a $2.5 billion company, is up 20% to $48.75, but lots of smaller computer stocks are doing better. Stratus Computer, capitalized at $472 million, is up 36%, and even smaller ones such as Rexon Inc., up 46% at $9.50 a share, are leading the computer group.    Microsoft Corp., the biggest computer software concern, is making headlines with its 28% jump in price, but some of the smaller software firms have bettered that. Informix Corp. has moved up 41% to $13.75, for example.    Companies that make semiconductors, microchips, disks and other hardware for computers, meanwhile, are coming out of a deep slump and outperforming the computer and software makers. Seagate Technology, one of the biggest disk drive manufacturers, is up 39% at $26.50 a share, and Silicon Systems Inc. is up 27% at $14.125.    Intel Corp., the biggest OTC semiconductor maker, is up 31% at $27.50 a share.    Business services -- particularly those that rely on technology and computers -- are strong, and little companies with new ideas are the strongest. IMS International Inc., a marketing research and mailing concern in the health field, is one of the biggest. But while its stock is up 17% at $28.125, Network Security Corp., a smaller service company that provides computerized wireless alarm systems, is up 40% at $7.    Most of the biggest price gainers also aren't the most visible. Liz Claiborne Inc., the largest women's apparel maker, with market capitalization of $992 million, is up 12% at $48; Oakhill Sportswear Corp., a $34 million capitalization New York-based company in the same line, is up 37% at $8.75.    Other groups that were strong in the early 1985 market, such as publishing, venture capital and small financial or investment companies, haven't shown startling gains so far this year. Within these groups, however, some stocks are moving. Biotech Capital Corp., a small investment company that specializes in biomedical and technology investments, is up 19%, more in line with technology stocks than with its own industry group.    Even smokestack stocks, including metal forgers, mills and steelmakers, have their standouts. Avery Inc., a small Philipsburg, Pa.-based coal mining and warehousing company, is up 40% at $3.50 a share.    Biomedical stocks, big gainers in early 1986, are underperforming the market a bit. But Genentech Inc., with a $1 billion market value, the biggest in the group, is up 18% at $100.25 a share, well ahead of its group.    In contrast, biotechnology stocks, particularly small makers of medical instrumentation, are strong. Electro-Biology Inc. is up 35% at $7.75, for example.    Thus far, OTC financial stocks have lagged the industrials, and the worst performance is coming from utilities, the most interest-rate-sensitive of all the stocks. The boom in stocks that perform well when interest rates and inflation rise, such as gold and oil-service issues, coupled with the underperformance in financial stocks suggests that investors expect some inflation.    Savings-and-loan stocks aren't included in the Nasdaq bank index. That index is adjusted each time a bank is acquired, which is one reason, according to the National Association of Securities Dealers, that the bank index for the fourth quarter and for all of 1986 was higher than the estimated performance of the banks still trading at year's end. Bank acquisitions haven't been a major factor in the past two weeks.    Estimates in the accompanying table were produced by sampling price changes in these and other groups of stocks, at various market capitalization levels, from a list of all Nasdaq stocks supplied by the NASD. Industry groups and niche groups were selected to give a sample of the general market tenor. An effort was made to weight the estimates by market capitalization, as in the Nasdaq indexes.    ---                      OTC MARKET SURGE Performance of selected stock                           %Chg     %Chg, to groups and                     %Chg    Last Qtr   mid-Jan. related indexes                1986      1986       1987 Dow Jones Industrials           23        8           9 OTC INDUSTRIAL INDEX             6        1.6        14    Restaurants                   4        6          10    Publishing                   36        5           9    Films, Videos                41      - 4          22    Casinos, Gaming              38        4          15    Broadcasting                 11      - 3          13    Telecommunications Equip.   -13        0          22    Computers                     8        5          20    Computer Software           - 8        5          20    Computer Components         -14        2          25    Bio-medical                   8        0           8    Medical Instruments           8        5          19    Marketing, Lists              3        0          13    Non-store Retail              9      - 7          14    Business Services             9        8          17    Apparel Makers               48        2          13    Apparel Stores               46       12          14    Convenience Stores           68       14          14    Supermarkets                 34        7          15    Meat, Poultry                40        3          10    Ice Cream                   -16      -11           2    Oil Exploration             -28      -12           7    Oil Field Service           -11      - 6          23    Waste Management             15        8          15    Combined Utilities           37        2           4    Metal Forging, Screws       - 6      - 4           9    Gold, Silver                 16      - 9          21    Paper                        28       12          15 OTC BANK INDEX                  18        3          10    Commercial Banks             16      - 1          11    Savings and Loans            14      - 3          10    OTC INSURANCE INDEX           6      - 5          10    Property-casualty             5      - 5          11    Life Insurers                10      - 3          10    Securities Brokers          - 3        1          13    Investment Companies         12        1           8    Small Business Finance      -76      - 3           3    REITs                       -19      - 4           6</TEXT></DOC>
