To collect $656 billion in federal withholding and other taxes from employers in fiscal 1986 took a clumsy, outmoded system involving 15,000 financial institutions and 68 million transactions using paper forms and checks. This federal-tax-deposit system generates many costly errors and delays federal investment of the cash. So the Treasury, the IRS, and the Federal Reserve plan to revamp it for the 1990s. One way would be to automate the present system by transferring data and funds electronically.    But W.E. Douglas of the Treasury's Financial Management Service says a new system eliminating the bank middlemen may offer more pluses and fewer minuses: Employers could deal directly with a central clearing house, even via personal computers and push-button phones. Cutting costs and advancing interest-bearing deposits by a day might gain over $230 million a year for the Treasury. American Bankers Association officials favor a move to electronics, but want time to study the proposals.    The agencies seek comment, hoping to decide around Jan. 1 on changes to take effect in 1991 or 1992.    AMNESTY SPREADS to more states and more types of taxes.    Over half the states now have tempted tax delinquents to pay up in return for penalty waivers. Washington, D.C., officials are &quot;very optimistic&quot; that the city's program ending today will top its $10 million goal. Florida, which has no personal income tax, gained $13 million with an amnesty ended June 30 for its tax on intangible property such as stocks and bonds; it plans an amnesty starting Jan. 1 for other taxes.    Arkansas's three-month program and Maryland's two-month one began Sept. 1. New Jersey's began Sept. 10 and runs to Dec. 8. Louisiana's second go-'round starts tomorrow and ends Dec. 15. West Virginia employers have to Dec. 31 to pay overdue unemployment taxes; the amnesty, which began July 1, has produced about $200,000 so far. Still, Ohio and Oregon legislators stifled proposals for amnesties and opted for tougher enforcement programs alone.    MUTUAL-FUND EXPENSES will add to shareholders' income under IRS rules.    Tax law now limits personal deductions of investment expenses such as advisory and management fees, including fees that mutual funds incur and previously subtracted before reporting taxable income to holders. In a letter to Rep. Callahan (R., Ala.), the Treasury's Dennis Ross outlined rules the IRS is writing on fund fees:    The funds will add certain expenses to income, reporting a gross rather than a net figure to holders, who will be treated as though they had incurred the costs directly. Holders then may include the expenses in miscellaneous itemized deductions, which are allowed only to the extent that the total exceeds 2% of adjusted gross income. (That means, of course, a holder may be taxed on fund expenses that he can't deduct.)    But the rules won't apply to fund shares held in individual retirement accounts; IRAs generally aren't taxed or allowed expense deductions.    ENOUGH'S ENOUGH: Ronald Z. and Shirley A. Krivitsky of Ellsworth, Pa., and three other couples took to the Tax Court a gold-and-silver mining shelter, sold by Resources America Inc., just like one the court already had rejected; they used the lawyer who lost the earlier case. Now the court has ordered each couple to pay $5,000 damages for pressing a frivolous action.    IT'S CLEAR SAILING for Marine Lt. Col. John R. Fogg of Beaufort, S.C. The Tax Court agrees that his 36-foot sailboat was a &quot;personal effect&quot; and lets him deduct $1,796 as the job-related cost of moving it to his new assigned post in 1982.    LAST GASP BEFORE TOLL: Today's the last day to file a new W-4 withholding-tax form with your employer to avoid a possible increase in withholding. The IRS estimates that about 20% of employees hadn't filed new W-4s by mid-September.    THEIR PERSPECTIVE wasn't perceptive when they donated these posters.    In December 1980, Joel B. and Elaine P. Goldstein of Englewood, Colo., bought warehouse receipts for 860 posters from an art dealer for $4,000 cash, $16,000 in 9% notes due in 1995, and $720 in prepaid interest. They had him give the receipts to their temple to fulfill pledges and took a $20,000 charitable deduction for 1980. A year later, having considered ways to liquidate several poster-receipt gifts, the temple sold them back to the dealer for cash and notes.    The IRS challenged the timing and the amount of the deduction; the Goldsteins replied in the Tax Court. Judge Hamblen rejected an IRS argument that the gift wasn't complete until the temple sold the receipts in 1981. But he agreed the couple should have known the gift was over-valued; he reduced the deduction to $10,347 -- the 1980 cash outlay of $4,720 plus $5,627 for the notes' discounted value on Dec. 27, 1980.    Because of the over-valuation, the judge upheld a negligence penalty.    BRIEFS: President Reagan plans to name Laurence J. Whalen, 42, of the Oklahoma City firm Crowe andamp; Dunlevy to succeed William A. Goffe on the Tax Court. . . . A Senate Finance panel plans hearings Monday and Oct. 19 on tax-code effects on international competitiveness. . . . John R. and Geraldine M. Gore of Hobart, Ind., aren't relieved of a late-return penalty just because their tax adviser recommended a delay to avoid an audit, the Tax Court holds. </TEXT></DOC>
