Ligachev deniedallegations of involvement in high-level corruption, the Novostipress agency said today.   Ligachev, a conservative who is considered a rival of PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev, ``resolutely denied'' the allegations made bya prosecutor in an election campaign, the official news agency said.   Ligachev issued the statement to the Supreme Soviet Presidium,the nation's top executive body, which already was investigatingthe prosecutor, Nikolai Ivanov, for abuses of power.   It was an extraordinary defense by a Politburo member of hisconduct, and remarkable in that it was made public in a telex sentby Novosti to The Associated Press bureau in Moscow. The personallives of Politburo members are usually shrouded in secrecy, and arenot reported by official Soviet media.   Ivanov and his boss, Telman Gdlyan, became nationally knowninvestigating corruption among local officials in the republic ofUzbekistan. The investigation reulted in a 12-year jail sentencefor Yuri Churbanov, the son-in-law of former President Leonid I.Brezhnev.   On Leningrad television Friday night, Ivanov said theirinvestigation turned up the names of Ligachev and several other topgovernment officials. He did not go into details.   Ivanov on Sunday won a seat in the newly formed parliament, theCongress of People's Deputies.   ``Yegor Ligachev has resolutely denied these allegations andcalled the attention of the commission to the fact that theslanderous statement was intended as a political provocation,''Novosti said.   ``He insists that the case be thoroughly considered and theresults reported in the press,'' Novosti continued.   A Presidium commission was formed to consider citizen complaintsthat the two prosecutors abused their power in investigatinghigh-level corruption. The Presidium is chaired by Gorbachev.   The commission said in the Communist Party daily Pravda onSaturday that the two prosecutors made ``provocative statements''about ``violations of law'' by some political leaders, and accusedthem of trying to disorient people and interfere with thecommission.   A separate probe by the Supreme Court already has determinedthat Gdlyan helped convict an innocent man in 1983 in Estonia. Theaccused, an eminent scientist, died in jail. The Supreme Court hasasked the prosecutor's office to consider dismissing Gdlyan as aresult of that case.   Gdlyan also won election to the new parliament in an earlierround. Both prosecutors garnered overwhelming majorities of votesin their districts during the balloting, which saw large numbers ofparty loyalists upset by reform candidates.</TEXT></DOC>
