Fast-transientstability programs, coherency-based dynamic equivalents, computer-assistedtransient network analyzers, and slip-stabilization studies are amongthe topics discussed. Security, contingency planning, and strategiespertaining to network stability are included. Transient stability dueto lightning surges are excluded and examined in a separate bibliography.(This updated bibliography contains 231 citations, all of which are newentries to the previous edition.)</TEXT></DOC>
