Sommer, Jr., Chief,Division of Regulations, Office of the Chief Counsel, Maritime Administration(202) 366-5181.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> The regulations at 46 CFR Part 298govern the administration of the provisions in Title XI of the  MerchantMarine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1271-1279). These regulationscontain definitions and procedures with respect to preferred mortgages,which comprise the principal security to the United States for its guaranteeof vessel obligations (debt instruments issued to finance vessels). Pub.L. 100-710, which became effective on Jan. 1, 1989, contains provisionscontrolling the transfer of interests in a vessel documented under U.S.law, or for which an application for documentation has been made in substantialcompliance with the documentation laws. Such transfers include the perfectingof a preferred mortgage, which is defined. Pub. L. 100-710 also repealsthe Ship Mortgage Act of 1920 (46 App. U.S.C. 984), to which referenceis made in these regulations. These amendments will conform the provisionsof these regulations to the requirements of Pub. L. 100-710 and other MARADregulations at 46 CFR Part 221 for actions concerning preferred mortgages.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Regulatory Impact </ITAG>This rulemaking has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291, and it hasbeen determined that this is not a major rule. It will not result in anannual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. There will be noincrease in production costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local governments, agencies or geographic regions. Furthermore,it will not adversely impact competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. This rulemaking does not involve any change in important Departmental policies,and is not considered significant. Since there should be a minimal economicimpact, further economic evaluation is unnecessary. Moreover, the DeputyMaritime Administrator certifies that these amendments will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.This rulemaking will have no environmental impact that requires an environmentalimpact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Ithas also been reviewed under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, and ithas been determined that it does not have sufficient implications for Federalismto warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Finally, this rulemaking contains no reporting requirements that requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to provision ofthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35).Since these amendments are technical in nature and merely conform the regulationsto the provisions of Pub. L. 100-710 and other MARAD regulations, thereis good cause for finding that the notice and comment requirements of 5U.S.C. 553 are not necessary and that the rule may become effective uponpublication. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 298 </ITAG>Banks, banking, loan programs-transportation, Maritime Administration,maritime carriers, mortgages, uniform system of accounts.Accordingly, 46 CFR Part 298 is amended as follows: 1.
