(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With a little help from his friends,a teen-ager who wants to save whales has taken on big business,organized a rally and helped dispel the notion that youthfulactivism is dead.   Eric Kessler, a senior at Highland Park High School, saidThursday he launched his crusade after seeing an environmentalgroup's petition urging Marriott Corp. to stop buying Icelandicfish in a move to halt commercial whale kills.   ``Amazing things are going on at our school and all overChicago. This started with five or 10 of my friends and it's grownto astronomical proportions,'' Kessler, 17, said in a telephoneinterview.   Marriott, a diversified hospitality company, had a contract tosupply Icelandic fish to the cafeteria at the school in thisnorthern suburb _ until Eric got involved.   Eric expressed his concern to school food-service workers, andtelephoned Marriott headquarters in suburban Washington. Icelandicfish was taken off the menu last month, as a result of his efforts.   Bolstered by success, Eric and a handful of friends beganplanning a rally to support their position that Iceland isviolating a 1986 International Whaling Commission moratorium on thekilling of whales for commercial purposes.   Iceland maintains whales are being killed only for research.   With advice and help from environmental groups like Greenpeace,which has organized an international boycott of companies that buyIcelandic fish, Kessler began distributing leaflets and makingphone calls advertising the rally.   He said celebrities such as scientist Carl Sagan, musician PaulWinter, Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., and Highland Park's mayor havepromised to write letters of support for the April 21 rally.   Students urged students at other high schools to come to therally in front of the school, and Kessler estimates more than 1,000people will show up to hear speeches by him, a Greenpeace officialand others.   ``Things have just been flying. I get calls every night frompeople who say, `I can do this for you, or have you tried to takethis route,''' Kessler said.   School authorities are barred from officially endorsing therally, but several said they support Eric's activism and plan toattend.   ``I think Eric raised appropriate sensitivity to the issue tothe food-services division,'' said Principal Ronald Tesch, adding,``I'm certain it had an influence'' on the decision to stop buyingIcelandic fish.   ``We encourage our kids to think and to act on theirconvictions,'' said counselor Vernon Hein. ``Eric isn't making it aschool issue, he's making it a kind of community concern.''   ``He's really a go-getter. People like Eric are making ithappen,'' said Sally Shoup, a whale campaigner at Greenpeace'sWashington office.   Marriott contends it's a politica _ not an environmental _ issue.   ``To our knowledge, Iceland fish processors have nothing to dowith the establishment of that country's whale-research program,''said Marriott spokeswoman Leslie Schlaggs.   ``We feel that any kind of economic boycott would be harming ortargeting the wrong people,'' she said, and Marriott explained thatposition to Eric.   But he's hooked on activism.   ``It's taking over my life and it's a great feeling,'' saidEric, who plans to study environmental conservation at theUniversity of Colorado next fall.   Said 15-year-old colleague Becky Auster, a Highland Parksophomore: ``It definitely gives me hope, because a lot of peopletend to think that today's younger generation is really apatheticand doesn't care what's happening.   ``This shows they do care, they just need someone to help themget started.''</TEXT></DOC>
