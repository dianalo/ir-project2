Policy makers &quot;got what they wanted,&quot; Bob Mograbi, foreign exchange manager in New York for Credit Suisse, said, referring to the finance ministers and central bank chiefs of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada. Recent currency trading has been &quot;the dullest we've seen in a long, long time,&quot; he said.    Although the dollar stayed in a narrow range, it was quoted near its intraday highs late in the day. Buying interest was inspired in part by President Reagan's decision to sign a strengthened version of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law.    Because of the large U.S. budget and trade deficits, market professionals' long-term view of the dollar continues to be gloomy. It hasn't been changed by the seven major industrial powers' reassertion of their goal of keeping the dollar relatively stable against other major currencies.    But in the short term, many traders have concluded that the wishes of the Group of Seven will prevail over the negative market sentiment.    &quot;I don't think the market has enough resolve to test the (dollar's) downside yet,&quot; Joseph F. Teel, a trader at Commercial Bank of Kuwait in New York, said.    He said another market assault on the dollar probably would require another series of poor U.S. economic data. Among the figures traders will be watching are the leading economic indicators, due tomorrow, and more significantly, the August merchandise trade deficit, which is to be reported next month.    Ronald H. Holzer, vice president and chief dealer at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago, said the apparent solidarity of the Group of Seven on maintaining a stable dollar is tempering the economic judgment of traders that the currency's decline should continue.    Currency traders, he said, noticed that the finance officials gave no indication of abandoning their use of market intervention to fight sudden moves in exchange rates.    &quot;The chance for one big move (by the dollar) one way or the other is rather limited right now,&quot; Mr. Holzer said.    Paul Chertkow, an economist with Hoare Govett Ltd., London, estimated that intervention by major central banks, mainly to support the dollar, may have totaled as much as $90 billion since the Group of Seven's original agreement to stabilize exchange rates was reached in Paris in February.    &quot;One of the things that has become evident is that the Group of Seven has accomplished what it set out to do,&quot; Mr. Teel of Commercial Bank of Kuwait said.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8280 West German marks, compared with 1.8217 late Friday, and 144.36 Japanese yen, compared with 143.55.    The dollar was quoted at 144.60 yen in early Tokyo trading today.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 10 cents an ounce to $460 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was three million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $460.65 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                  LATE NEW YORK TRADING                 Monday, Sept. 28, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
