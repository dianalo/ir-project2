The answer, ruled a Manhattan judge, is only when they aresufficiently &quot;novel.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The decision is the latest of several similar rulings thatmake it increasingly difficult for financial-productinventors -- including brokerage firms -- to prove thatthey've come up with something new.   Insurance actuary Gary Granoff charged the firm withstealing his idea for &quot;Portfolio Protection Insurance.&quot; Mr.Granoff approached Merrill, where he had an account, in 1986with a proposal that would allow the firm to offer customersa partial guarantee against losses in their securitiesportfolios. Merrill signed a contract agreeing to keep theproposal confidential and to pursue it only if it signed aformal agreement with Mr. Granoff.   Mr. Granoff charged that Merrill in June 1987 offered aproduct, the Growth andamp; Guarantee Fund, that was based upon hisproposal. He sued the firm for breach of contract,misappropriation and fraud.   But U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson, in a summaryjudgment, ruled that Mr. Granoff hadn't proved the &quot;novelty&quot;of his portfolio-insurance product. &quot;Because his idea was notnovel, {Mr. Granoff} did not own a property interest in it,&quot;the judge wrote in a 23-page opinion. And whether the ideawas new or not, the judge added, Merrill didn't steal itanyway.   Catherine Samuels, a lawyer for Merrill at the New Yorklaw firm Schulte Roth andamp; Zabel, said there is relativelylittle case law on the question of when ideas are protectedas property, especially on Wall Street. &quot;In thefinancial-services industry, ideas can be worth a lot ofmoney,&quot; she said. Although Merrill signed a contractinvolving Mr. Granoff's idea, &quot;This opinion holds that acontract like that isn't enforceable unless the idea isnovel.&quot;   Mr. Granoff hasn't decided whether to appeal the ruling,said his lawyer, Michael P. Fuchs of Wolf Popper Ross Wolf andamp;Jones. &quot;We're still looking at it,&quot; he said.   Cases involving whether financial products can be legallyprotected have been watched closely by Wall Street becausemany new products are simply &quot;variations on the theme,&quot; sayssecurities lawyer Thomas Russo of Cadwalader, Wickersham andamp;Taft.   &quot;This is an important area for brokerage firms: What canbe protected as proprietary?&quot; added Sam Scott Miller, alawyer at Orrick, Herrington andamp; Sutcliffe.   Merrill's court victory is ironic, Mr. Miller suggested,because brokerage firms themselves &quot;have been aggressivelyseeking the protection of copyright and trademark and otherintellectual-property kinds of protections&quot; for theirproducts.   ---   WASHINGTON, D.C., LAWYER ACCUSED of soliciting business.   In an unusual action, mass-disaster lawyer John P. Coalewas charged with soliciting legal business from the family ofa victim of the poultry processing plant fire in Hamlet,N.C., that killed 25 people last month.   Mr. Coale and an investigator who works for him werecharged by a North Carolina prosecutor with breaking a statelaw that makes it a misdemeanor offense to solicit legalclients by phone or in person in the state. Violators can besentenced to up to two years in jail.   Mr. Coale is best known as one of the first U.S. lawyerson the scene in Bhopal, India, following the 1984 poison gasleak at a Union Carbide Corp. chemical plant. He was also oneof the first lawyers to arrive at the site of the huge DuPontPlaza hotel fire in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In both instances,Mr. Coale found himself at the center of a raging debatewithin the legal profession over how actively -- if at all --lawyers should seek out clients at mass-disaster scenes.   Mr. Coale said that the North Carolina State Bar initiatedthe charges against him in an effort to intimidateout-of-state lawyers. &quot;What seems to have happened is theout-of-state lawyers {angered} the local boys,&quot; he said.   Dozens of lawyers descended on Hamlet following the Sept.3 fire. The state bar set up its own booth at a disastercenter with referral lists of North Carolina lawyers. Mr.Coale conceded that he wrote letters to victims and theirfamilies but maintained that he visited potential clientsonly after being invited.   State legal ethics codes and the American Bar Associationfrown on lawyers who solicit clients by phone or in person,but disciplinary action is usually left up to state and localbar associations. A state law making such solicitations acrime &quot;is very unique,&quot; said Cassie Dalla Santa, an assistantcounsel at the ABA's Center for Professional Responsibility.   North Carolina State Bar President Tommy Jarrett, ofGoldsboro, declined to say publicly what Mr. Coale allegedlydid to warrant pressing criminal charges against him. Hedisputed Mr. Coale's assertion that the bar is seeking toharass out-of-state lawyers, saying a North Carolina attorneymay also soon be charged with improper solicitations.   Carroll Lowder, the prosecutor on the case, couldn't bereached for comment yesterday.   ---   PHILIPPINES CASE AGAINST Westinghouse is cleared fortrial.   A federal district judge denied Westinghouse ElectricCorp.'s motion to dismiss the case, which alleges that thePittsburgh company passed bribes to former PhilippinesPresident Ferdinand Marcos, through consultants, in order towin a nuclear power-plant contract.   Westinghouse said in a statement that Judge Dickinson R.Debevoise's denial doesn't mean &quot;Westinghouse has won or lostthis case or that there was or was not any bribery.&quot; It meansonly &quot;that factual questions exist which the jury mustdetermine.&quot;   The company predicted that a jury would find &quot;absolutelyno wrongdoing on the part of Westinghouse. . . . the sameconclusion reached by the Department of Justice in 1978 andthe Securities and Exchange Commission in 1983.&quot;   ---   GAY COMMUNITY PATROL can't use Pink Panther name, judgerules.   The ruling, a preliminary injunction, was issued in a suitfiled by MGM-Pathe Communications Co. charging that thecommunity patrol's name and its use of a pink paw print,infringed on the company's Pink Panther trademark. Members ofthe group, which calls itself the Pink Panther Patrol, wearT-shirts emblazoned with the paw print while patrollingManhattan streets to protect gay men and lesbians.   U.S. District Court Judge Pierre N. Leval wrote in hisopinion that the association with the patrol will harm MGM'strademark by confusing the public as to whether Pink Pantherstands for &quot;lighthearted, nonpolitical, asexual, amicable,comic entertainment&quot; or &quot;political activism, violence,defiance, homosexuality and angry confrontation.&quot;   But the judge allowed the group to continue to use the pawprint, ruling that once the patrol stops using the name thelikelihood of confusion over the paw print will diminish.MGM's suit seeks $300,000 in damages.   ---   NOTED: Roger Mentz, who served as the Treasury's top taxofficial during enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, isleaving the law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham andamp; Taft, wherehe was a partner, to join McClure andamp; Trotter, a smallWashington, D.C., law firm that specializes in tax issues.The law firm will be renamed McClure, Trotter andamp; Mentz.
