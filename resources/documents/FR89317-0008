Asahara, DC9/MD80Program Manager, Airframe Branch, ANM-122L, FAA, Northwest Mountain Region,Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, 3229 East Spring Street, LongBeach, California 90806-2425; telephone (213) 988-5321.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> On May 31, 1988, the FAA issued AD88-13-09, Amendment 39-5954 (53 FR 21411; June 8, 1988), to require thestructural inspection of the aft pressure bulkhead using low frequencyeddy current inspection techniques from the forward side of the bulkheadof all McDonnell Douglas Model DC-9 series airplanes. That AD was promptedby reports of cracks in the aft pressure bulkhead tee cap. This condition,if not corrected, could result in rapid depressurization of the fuselage,causing structural damage and possible loss of adjacent structures, includingdamage to control cables, with subsequent loss of airplane control. Since issuance of AD 88-13-09, a DC-9 operator reported finding a 24-inchcrack in the non-ventral aft pressure bulkhead tee while performing anunscheduled heavy maintenance inspection. Preliminary analysis of the teerevealed that the cracks initiated at multiple sites on the forward surfaceof the upstanding leg of the tee as the result of metal fatigue due tobending and preloads. The crack was detected on an airplane having logged36,079 landings, with 40,336 total hours on the fuselage. Fractrographicanalysis revealed that the crack initiated approximately 12,000 landingsprior to its discovery. In light of this new report of cracking, the FAAhas determined that the initial inspection threshold for compliance withthe inspection requirements of AD 88-13-09 must be reduced to 25,000 landingson airplanes equipped with non-ventral aft pressure bulkheads in orderto adequately detect cracking in a timely manner. The FAA canvassed the affected airline operators, through the Air TransportAssociation (ATA) of America, and McDonnell Douglas, to ascertain theirexperience with the low frequency eddy current inspection from the forwardside of the bulkhead, as an option provided in AD 88-13-09. From informationsupplied by those groups, the FAA has determined that, due to the complexityand difficulty in performing that type of inspection, the results may notbe reliable and, therefore, the inspection may not be effective. The FAAhas determined that a high frequency eddy current inspection of the 5910163-91and -92 attach tee from the aft side of the bulkhead, coupled with an opticallyaided visual inspection, will more adequately detect cracking in the attachtee area. In addition, the FAA has determined that sealant must be removedfrom the inspection area prior to inspection. Further, because of the differencesin the eddy current inspection equipment sensitivity, the FAA has determinedthat the interval between inspections of the 5910163-91 and -92 attachtees must be reduced to 500 landings. The FAA has determined that, due to the multiple-site nature of the reportedcracking, continued operation of airplanes with cracks is unacceptable.Accordingly, this action does not permit the interim repair for certaincracks as currently described in paragraph C.2.a. of AD 88-13-09. The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas Alert Service BulletinA57-231, dated February 24, 1989, which describes high frequency eddy currentinspection of the attach tee area, and repairs or replacement, if necessary.Since this unsafe condition may exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design equipped with a non-ventral aft pressure bulkhead,this AD requires repetitive high frequency eddy current inspection of the5910163-91 and -92 attach tee, coupled with repetitive optically aidedvisual inspections of the attach tee from the aft side of the bulkhead,and repair or replacement, if necessary. Subsequent inspections are alsorequired after any repair or replacement. Additionally, affected operatorsare required to remove sealant from the inspection area prior to inspection.The requirements of this AD differ from and replace the requirements ofAD 88-13-09 for airplanes equipped with non-ventral aft pressure bulkheadsby: (1) Deleting the option for low frequency eddy current inspectionsfrom the forward side of the bulkhead; (2) lowering the initial inspectionthreshold called out in AD 88-13-09 to 25,000 landings; (3) eliminatingthe interim repair provided by that AD; and (4) eliminating the optionalinspections from the forward side of the bulkhead. Since a situation exists that requires immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable,and good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than30 days. The FAA is currently preparing a similar action to address revised inspectionrequirements for Model DC-9 series airplanes equipped with a ventral aftpressure bulkhead. However, the proposed compliance time would not precludea period for public comment. (Therefore, that action will appear as a Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking.) The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationthat is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291. It is impracticablefor the agency to follow the procedures of Order 12291 with respect tothis rule since the rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafecondition in aircraft. It has been further determined that this documentinvolves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If this action is subsequently determinedto involve a significant/major regulation, a final regulatory evaluationor analysis, as appropriate, will be prepared and placed in the regulatorydocket (otherwise, an evaluation or analysis is not required).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 </ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends Section 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
