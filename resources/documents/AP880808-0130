He has been a professor of government for the Claremont GraduateSchool at Harvey Mudd College in California and is a graduate ofPepperdine University and Claremont Graduate School.   Ralph Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference onCivil Rights, criticized the selection of Allen.   ``Regrettably the president has named another right-wingidealogue as chairman of the civil rights commission,'' Neas said.``His decision continues to ensure that the commission will lackany credibility and will remain a joke.''
