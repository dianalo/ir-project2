Bush proposedthat all such workers hired before April 1, 1986, be required to pay that tax,which is 1.45 percent of the first $120,000 of wages.;    Congress hasrejected that proposal in each of the last several years. State and localworkers hired since April 1, 1986, already are paying the tax. The extensionwould bring in $7.1 billion over the next five years.;    In a writtenmessage, Bush said his savings incentives would enhance the nation's potentialfor long-term growth. All three proposals failed in Congress last year asCongress negotiated a long-term, deficit-cutting agreement with theadministration.;    The president proposed to:;    (check) Allow 30 percent ofcapital gains, which are profits from the sale of investments, to be excludedfrom taxation for property owned more than three years. Twenty percent ofgains from two-year property and 10 percent from property owned a year orlonger would be excluded.;    Capital gains now are taxed at a maximum rate of28 percent, although higher-income people pay a rate of 31 percent on a partof their wages and other income. The proposal would cut the maximumcapital-gains rate to 19.6 percent.;    (check) Permit a person to set asideup to $2,500 a year in a special savings account that, if held for more thanseven years, would produce tax-exempt interest. The contribution itself wouldbe fully taxable. The special account would be limited to individuals withannual incomes of $60,000 or less and families with $120,000 or less.;   (check) Allow a penalty-free withdrawal of up to $10,000 from an IndividualRetirement Account to help a family buy its first home.;    (check) Extendseveral tax breaks that are due to expire Dec. 31, including those forbusiness research and investors in low-income rental housing.;    (check)Create tax incentives to lure employers to locate in up to 50 economicallydeprived &quot;enterprise zones.&quot;;    (check) Increased user fees to bring in about$12 billion over the next five years. These include a requirement thatveterans pay a greater share of their medical bills for illnesses notconnected to their military service or if they have a service-connecteddisability that is rated 40 percent or lower.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910204  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  466  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday February 4, 199100035134,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
