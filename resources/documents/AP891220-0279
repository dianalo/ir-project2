Dozens of highrise office buildings are opening in the capitalthis year and next, at a time when many overseas companies arereducing operations in China or putting off new investment.   ``It's going to be survival of the fittest,'' said James R.Pitchon of Richard Ellis, property consultant for the World TradeCenter, Beijing's biggest building project. ``We have a baby markethere, and things have been made worse by the current economicsituation.''   Pitchon estimated that by the end of 1990 there will be nearlydouble the amount of office space currently required by the 1,100foreign companies with offices in Beijing.   It will be a drastic turnaround from even a year ago, when morethan half of all foreigners were working out of Chinese hotel roomswith peeling paint, antiquated telephones and stalled elevators.   Foreign companies began moving representatives into Beijingaround 1980 with the advent of Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms andopen door policy. But it was not until 1985, with the opening ofthe 29-story China International Trust and Investment Corp. (CITIC)building, that a select few companies had their first access tomodern office space.   In 1986 the Holiday Inn Lido complex of hotel, apartments andoffices opened for businessmen and the next year the 23-story NobleTower, a project marked by bitter disputes between its Chinese andCanadian partners, began taking in tenants.   But that still provided only about 57,000 square yards of officespace. By next year, the figure will be five times as great.   Heading the newcomers is the World Trade Center, a joint venturewith Hong Kong-based Kerry Industrial Co. That features a 38-storytower with 61,000 square yards of office space, two 30-story luxuryapartment buildings and two hotels with more than 1,000 rooms.   Among the competition is the Jing Guang Center, a 51-storyoffice-apartment-hotel built with Hong Kong and Japaneseparticipation; the 20-story Fortune Building financed by Japan'sNomura Securities Group; the Hua Wei Center, a Norwegian-Chineseapartment-business project with 23,000 square yards of officespace; and Capital Mansion, a CITIC undertaking with a 52-storyoffice-apartment building.   Their openings, however, are clouded by the June militarycrackdown on the pro-democracy movement and an austerity policythat has stalled the economy and left in doubt the future directionof China's market-oriented reforms. Few companies have left China,but many have trimmed expatriate staff or canceled plans forfurther investment.   Many foreign businesses likely will wait one or two years beforedeciding the extent of their commitment to China, some real estateexperts say, and investing in costly new office quarters will notbe a top priority.   Most of the projects are months behind schedule because oftypical construction delays in China compounded by work stoppagesduring the political turmoil of this spring. The World Trade,originally slated to cost $380 million, now will require $450million due to expense overruns.   Many projects, such as the two-tower Asia-Pacific Buildingfinanced partly by Singaporean and Japanese funds, have asked forrescheduling of loans and extensions of joint venture contractsbecause of expected slow returns on investment.   The Chinese partner in the World Trade Center, the Ministry ofForeign Economic Relations and Trade, has already agreed to extendthe life of the joint venture from 20 to 30 years.   At least one major project, a planned 17-story hotel and officebuilding involving the Japanese builder Takenaka Komuten,Mitsubishi Bank and Japan Air Lines, halted construction after June.   ``We haven't abandoned the project,'' Takenaka spokesman FujioTakeuchi said in Tokyo. But he said the project team is waiting forthe domestic situation in China to return to normal.   Another project, CITIC's Capital Mansion, has been hit byconstruction delays and financing problems and, according to someforeign real estate experts, is a ``white elephant.''   Capital Mansion Deputy General Manager Yang Long said thebuilding will not open until the end of 1990. He expressedconfidence the project would succeed, but said it isn't signingcontracts yet and ``we face serious competition.''   ``It's a race against time,'' said George P. Maier, chiefoperations officer of the Jing Guang Center. Those already takingin tenants have a big advantage, he said.   The Jing Guang began filling its offices and apartments inDecember and the World Trade Center will have 115 tenants, about 60percent occupancy, by the end of January.   The Fortune Building, promoted by its Japanese managers as ahigh-technology office complex with a satellite transmissionnetwork, has about 40 mostly Japanese tenants and foreseesoccupancy of about 65 percent next year.   The Norwegian Hua Wei Center, which won't open until nextsummer, has leased only 20 percent of its office space and likemany others is offering ``flexible terms'' to attract customers.   The center is asking $35 per square yard a month, but SalesManager Dorophy Leung said ``this price is negotiable and we willoffer discounts.''   The World Trade Center has also cut its rates from near $40 toabout $35 a square yard.   Office buildings also may face competition from newly builthotels, which face an even greater glut in the near future becauseof the post-June collapse of the tourist market. The StateCouncil-owned Capital Hotel, with an occupancy rate of 30 percent,recently began advertising guest suites for use as offices.   According to one survey, there will be about 24,000 rooms inWestern-style hotels in Beijing by 1991, double that of 1988 andseven times the figure in 1983.   Developers said the oversupply problem should eventually workitself out, but much depends on China's political stability andeconomic health. ``It could be a boom town,'' said the World TradeCenter's Pitchon. ``And it could be a ghost town.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday Dec. 24</NOTE></DOC>
