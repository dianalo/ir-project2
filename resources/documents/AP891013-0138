The government's new crop estimates for corn and soybeans camein higher than expected at 7.45 billion bushels and 1.93 billionbushels respectively.   The 1989 wheat-crop estimate of 2.04 billion bushels was belowexpectations, as was the government's projection that U.S. wheatstocks would total 443 million bushels next May 31, the end of thecurrent marketing year, compared with 698 million bushels at theend of the 1988-89 marketing year.   ``If there was a surprise in the report, it was probably in thewheat,'' said Walter Spilka, grain market analyst with SmithBarney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York. ``Those wheat stocks arefairly tight.''   The corn market's losses were limited by buying linked to theUSDA's announcement late Thursday of a sale of 100,000 metric tonsof U.S. corn to the Soviet Union.
