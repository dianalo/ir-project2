(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL's chief builder testified today thathe took an offer from evangelist Jerry Falwell to PTL founder JimBakker that would give Bakker a $300,000 salary ``if he kept hismouth shut.''   Builder Roe Messner, testifying for the defense at Bakker'sfraud trial, also said a top Bakker aide claimed to be ``acting onmy own'' in offering hush money to Jessica Hahn.   A spokesman for Falwell disputed the witness' account, sayingthat what Messner described as an offer from Falwell to Bakker wasreally a request from Bakker to Falwell.   Falwell, whose television ministry is based in Lynchburg, Va.,and who started the defunct Moral Majority, took over PTLtemporarily in 1987 after Bakker resigned following disclosure ofthe sex-and-money scandal involving Ms. Hahn.   Under questioning from defense attorneys, Messner said thatafter Bakker left the ministry and Falwell took it over, Falwellsent him to Palm Springs, Calif., to make Bakker an offer thatincluded $300,000 salary, a maid, a security guard for a year,health insurance and phone expenses.   Bakker's wife, Tammy, wrote the offer down and Bakker wrote atthe bottom of the piece of paper: ``I'm not making any demands onPTL. I'm not asking for anything.'' Bakker's statement wasapparently in reference to whether he would return to PTL.   Bakker is accused of defrauding followers who sent PTL more than$158 million and of misusing more than $3.7 million in ministrymoney for his own benefit. He faces up to 120 years in prison andmore than $5 million in fines if convicted on all charges: 15counts of wire fraud, eight counts of mail fraud and one count ofconspiring to commit mail and wire fraud.   Messner testified about the $265,000 hush money payment to Ms.Hahn, saying Richard Dortch, PTL's executive vice president, askedhim to do a favor on Feb. 21, 1985.   Dortch had legal papers with him and told Messner that if hedidn't pay a woman from New York $265,000 then she would go to TheCharlotte Observer with allegations that Bakker raped her. Messnersaid Dortch came to him for help because Dortch knew he would keepit confidential.   Five days later, Messner said, he wired the $265,000 to anaccount number in California that was given to him by Dortch.   Messner said he asked Dortch if Bakker knew about the payment.He said Dortch replied: ``No, I'm acting on my own.'' Dortch saidhe had the authority to spend the $265,000 because he was PTL'schief executive officer, he said.   Messner said Dortch asked him to make up a bogus invoice forwork never done, which he refused to do.   Messner said he agreed to make the payment in part because theAssemblies of God was named as the potential party in Ms. Hahn'sproposed lawsuit. ``I didn't think the church ought to be draggedinto this incident,'' Messner said.   Messner said he didn't know Ms. Hahn's name and never heardanything else about the situation until Bakker's resignation inMarch 1987.   Mark DeMoss, a Falwell spokesman, said Falwell sent Messner tomeet with the Bakkers not long after Bakker resigned, but did nottake any specific offer. Instead, DeMoss said, Messner returnedfrom the meeting with a hand-written list on Mrs. Bakker'sstationery of what the Bakkers wanted from PTL.   Moss said the list included Bakker's $300,000 annual salary forlife, Mrs. Bakker's $100,000 annual salary for life, all rights tobooks and records, secretary and maid service for a year, the SouthCarolina lakefront house and attorneys' fees.   ``I would like to think Roe just forgot the sequence ofevents,'' DeMoss said.</TEXT></DOC>
