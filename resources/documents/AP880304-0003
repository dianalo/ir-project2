The proposal had been pushed by Democratsas an alternative to military aid for the rebels.   The final vote of 216-208 was a defeat for House Speaker JimWright and his Democratic lieutenants, who had sought to craft apackage that would diffuse pressure for future military aid for therebels. But it also damaged administration hopes that the Contras,whose last U.S. aid ran out Tuesday, could be given any newinfusion of aid in the near future.   Liberal Democrats opposed to the Contras joined Republicans, whothought the package too weak, in voting it down.   House action came just a month after the House rejectedPresident Reagan's request for both humanitarian and military aid.   The Democratic package had included money for food, clothing,medicine and shelter for the anti-Sandinista rebels and a $14million program of aid for children injured in the Nicaraguan civilwar.   Reagan welcomed the vote, but Wright, D-Texas, said it may prove``a somewhat pyrrhic victory'' for Republicans. Wright said he hadno immediate plans to revive a Contra aid plan, and other Democratsvowed to make any new try for aid difficult.   ``As far as I'm concerned, it ought to be a damned lengthyprocess,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the HouseAppropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the matter, anda Contra opponent.   ``This has effectively stopped aid for the near future,'' addedRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.   In a written statement, Reagan called on Congress ``to acturgently to develop an aid package which is effectively deliverableand of sufficient quantity to sustain the Nicaraguan freedomfighters.   ``If not, the prospects for peace and democracy inside Nicaraguawill diminish quickly,'' Reagan said.   The House had set up a procedure under which theDemocrat-written package would come before the chamber as anamendment to a competing but similar Republican bill. It wasadopted on a vote of 215 to 210, replacing the GOP version. Butminutes later, the entire package was defeated on a final vote. TheHouse never voted on the Republican plan.   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., who led the Republican debate,said supporters of Contra aid were never given an option they couldsupport.   ``This plan didn't do anything,'' he said. ``It was just alousy, lousy bill. We were saying we weren't going to vote for it,and they didn't believe it.''   As he returned to the White House from a NATO summit inBrussels, Belgium, Reagan said ``I'm very happy'' when asked aboutthe defeat of the Democratic package. Spokesman Marlin Fitzwaterexplained the president meant he was happy to have another ``chanceto work on an adequate package of humanitarian aid for the freedomfighters.''   However, a spokeswoman for the Contras said in Miami that theleadership of the Nicaraguan Resistance, a Contra umbrella group,had wanted the measure to pass.   ``Every time the United States turns its back on the Contras, itputs us in a less favorable position,'' said Contra spokeswomanMarta Sacasa. The Sandinistas ``will become even more intransigentand more hard line....   ``We are fighting against an enemy that doesn't have these kindsof problems. The aid from the Soviet Union has not stopped flowingto the Sandinistas,'' Ms. Sacasa said.   The Sandinista government hailed the vote and called for directtalks between Reagan and Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.   The vote ``must contribute to the peace efforts taken by thepresidents of the Central American countries,'' a statementreleased by government spokesman Manuel Espinoza said.   Reagan, in a letter from Brussels, said the Democratic plan``does not meet the essential criteria'' of maintaining militarypressure on the Sandinistas.   Wright called the dispute over the aid package ``a battle forpeace in Nicaragua, and for a constructive role for the UnitedStates in Central America as opposed to a destructive role.''   Reagan, in his letter, agreed that the vote represented ``awatershed in our policies toward Central America.'' But he said theDemocratic proposal would have led ``to rapid debilitation of theresistance and further encouragement of Sandinista intransigence.''   The Republican alternative, he said, would ave kept alive``prospects for democracy and meaningful talks toward peace.''   The Democratic package included about $16 million in food,clothing, medicine and shelter for the rebels, intended to last atleast through June; and $14 million to set up a fund to helpchildren injured in the seven-year Nicaraguan civil war.   On Feb. 3, the House defeated, 219-211, a $36.2 million Reaganproposal that included money for weapons and other militaryequipment.   In debate Thursday, both sides argued that their version wouldbest enhance a Central American peace process.   ``Our opportunity today is to construct a united position onNicaragua policy for the first time in eight years,'' said Rep. LeeHamilton, D-Ind., a sponsor of the Democratic package.   ``It says to the Contras that the United States is not going toprovide them the means to make war. But neither is the UnitedStates going to turn away from them,'' Hamilton said.   But Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., called the proposal ``asurrender package. It could turn the freedom fighters into refugeesin their own country.''   Cease-fire talks between the two warring sides were stalled asthe debate occurred in Congress.   But Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega proposed for the firsttime holding high-level direct talks inside Nicaragua, withoutCardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, who has been serving as a mediator.The Contras agreed to a meeting, but only if Obando were includedas a ``witness and guarantor.''   In seeking to craft a majority for their package, Democrats werefaced with challenges from at least two sides. They needed thevotes of moderates who were reluctant to totally abandon therebels, believing that they provide useful pressure to keep theSandinistas bargaining in good faith.   They also needed the votes of the party's liberal wing, most ofwhom have steadfastly refused to vote for aid to the rebels in anyform.   Party leaders argued that passage of this purely``humanitarian'' aid bill would lessen chances that Reagan couldcome back to Congress soon with a request for weapons andammunition to sustain the Contras.   The Republican alternative contained more money for the rebels _about $22 million _ and placed fewer restrictions on the way theContras could use the aid, allowing purchase of non-lethal militarysupplies. The GOP package also contained a children's aid fundsimilar to that proposed by Democrats.   The GOP package also would have permitted the president to askfor military aid any time after April 15 and would have expeditedaction on such a request.   Even before the House acted, White House chief of staff HowardBaker said the administration would go to the Senate for whateverit failed to obtain in the House. ``We have good strength in theSenate,'' he said.   Republicans noted that the Democratic bill would turn overresponsibility for delivery of the supplies to the DefenseDepartment, rather than the existing CIA-run supply network. Evenif the Pentagon retained the private contractors now used by theCIA to make supply flights, U.S. military personnel would have tobe present in the region to oversee them, Edwards said.   The Republican alternative would have left the delivery ofsupplies in the hands of the CIA.</TEXT></DOC>
