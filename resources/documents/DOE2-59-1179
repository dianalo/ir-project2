It is interesting to observe thatthe IPAC was initiated during PS and AGS construction and USPAC was launchedin the eve of FNAL approval and construction. Historically, EPAC willbe remembered as created in the aftermath of the refound confidence afterthe discovery of W at CERN. It was openly stated that there are two reasonsof starting a new series of conferences on particle accelerators. First,to balance US's domination in this field. Secondly, to provide balancebetween large accelerator for high energy physics and small and mediumsize accelerators for nuclear, material and medical uses. The Europeansregained confidence in research after three Nobel Physics prizes in arow and determined to stay in leadership position in high energy physicsby being aggressive in accelerator design and construction. It is evidentthat there are many new projects under construction in Europe, for example,LEP, HERA, ESRF, Trieste LS, ISIS, ESR, TSR, MIMAS, COSY, CELISIUS, CRYRING,etc. They also have better cooperation with industries both in the proposaland construction of the accelerators.</TEXT></DOC>
