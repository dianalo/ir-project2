<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-24-0423 </DOCNO><TEXT>Water soluble organic salts comprise a large class of crystalline materialscontaining many efficient harmonic generators for producing blue andnear ultraviolet light. Among the salts of simple chiral organic acidsand bases, about 1 in 10 crystals has a nonlinearity greater than orequal to KDP. The distribution of noncritical wavelengths among thesecrystals peaks around 500 nm for Type I doubling and 700 nm for TypeII. We estimate the number of chiral organic salts which must be examinedin a survey in order to assure with high probability that an ``optimized''crystal for a given frequency conversion process will be found. 8 refs.,3 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
