A methodology is presentedfor using the results of PRAs for similar (surrogate) plants, along withplant-specific information about the target and surrogate plants to inferimportant failure modes for systems and components of the target plant.This methodology, and the rationale on which it is based, is presentedin the context of its application to Babcock and Wilcox (B andamp; W) plants.The Rancho Seco plant has been analyzed using PRA information from twosurrogate plants: Arkansas Nuclear One Unit 1 (ANO-1) and Oconee. Analysisresults have been used to develop plant-specific Rancho Seco informationfor potential use by inspectors at NRC Region 5.</TEXT></DOC>
