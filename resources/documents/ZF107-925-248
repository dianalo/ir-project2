 It explores two more Data Query commands andreveals a shortcut for performing repeated query operations.andP;  A futurearticle will address the database statistical functions.andM;As readers of this column have learned, you can use Criterion ranges to findor copy selected information.andP;  Criterion ranges can also help you removeunwanted information from a database, list examples of each category ofinformation stored in the database, and perform statistical analysis oninformation stored in a database.andM;If you haven't followed the last three installments, you should refer to thembefore proceeding, unless you already understand Criterion-rangefundamentals.andM;RECYCLE YOUR WORKSHEETandM;If you saved the practice worksheet from last month's column, you can use itas the basis for this month's exercises.andP;  If you don't have last month'sworksheet, skip ahead to the &quot;Build the Worksheet&quot; section.andM;Retrieve the worksheet and erase the second row of the Criterion range(A2..D2).andP;  Erase the Output range's field names and the records in the cellsbelow them.andP;  If you saved your worksheet after last month's final exercise,this is range A15..C17.andM;Now copy the field names from range A4..D4 to cell A15.andP;  Specify the newOutput range by pressing slash, selecting Data Query Output, and indicatingrange A15..D15.andP;  this new Output range includes all the field names from thecorresponding database Input range.andP;  Remember that all data below a one-rowOutput range will be erased by subsequent Data Query commands.andP;  Now, skipahead to the &quot;One More Time&quot; section.andM;BUILD THE WORKSHEETandM;The illustration shows a database Input range and its associated Criterionrange and Output range.andM;To create the database Input range, enter the labels shown in row 4 and inrange A5..B12 of the model.andP;  Next, enter the values in range C5..D12.andP;  Omitthe dollar signs and commas as you enter the values.andP;  But after you haveentered them, use the Range Format Currency command to assign a currencyformat with zero decimal places.andM;You also need to create a Criterion range and an Output range.andP;  Copy thelabels from range A4..D4 to cell A1.andP;  Then copy range A4..D4 to cell A15.andM;Now use the Data Query commands to assign the database Input, Criterion, andOutput ranges: Select/Data Query input and indicate range A4..D12.andP;  SelectCriterion and indicate range A1..D2.andP;  Then select Output and indicate rangeA15..D15.andP;  Finally, select Quit.andM;If any of the preceding tasks were new to you or confusing, stop now andreview the previous Start Here columns.andP;  If you're comfortable with whatyou've done so far, it's time to enter a criterion and extract some recordsfrom the database.andM;ONE MORE TIMEandM;Let's briefly review Criterion ranges and the Data Query Extract command.andO;You'll need a good understanding of these to learn the new techniques ahead.andM;Suppose that you want to examine every record that contains the label East inthe Region field.andP;  Move the cell pointer to cell A2 and enter East.andP;  Thenselect/Data Query Find.andP;  The cell pointer expands and highlights the recordin row 5, the first of the eastern region's records.andM;You can find the next record for the eastern region simply by pressing theDownArrow key.andP;  When you are finished examining the records, press the Returnkey.andM;To copy all the records for the eastern region from the database to theOutput range, select Extract from the Data Query menu, then select Quit.andO;When you select Extract 1-2-3 compares the entry or entries in the Criterionrange with the first entry of the database.andP;  If there is an exact math, 1-2-3copies the record from the database to the first row of the Output range.andP;  Ifthere is no match 1-2-3 doesn't copy the entry.andM;1-2-3 then compares the second database record with the entries in theCriterion range.andP;  Again, if there is a match, 1-2-3 copies the record.andP;  1-2-3continues to copy every matching record to the Output range.andM;UNIQUE AND DELETEandM;By now you should know how to use criteria in conjunction with the Data QueryFind and Data Query Extract commands.andP;  Two more commands on the Data Querymenu should also be of interest to you.andM;The Data Query Delete command eliminates unwanted records, while the DataQuery Unique command shows what categories of entries exist in the database.andM;Assume that you want to delete records that show less than $10,000 inNovember sales.andP;  Instead of manually locating and removing each of theserecords, you can use the Data Query Delete command.andM;Start by erasing the label in cell A2.andP;  Then move the cell pointer to cell D2and enter the formula +D5 [is less than] 10000.andP;  This criterion tells 1-2-3to select only the records whose Nov field contains a value less than 10,000Confirm this by selecting /Data Query Find 1-2-3 highlights the database'seighth record.andP;  Because this is the last record in the database, there is noneed to press the DownArrow key to see if other records match the criterion.andO;Press Return to end the command.andM;Remember to issue the Data Query Find or Data Query Extract command beforeyou issue a Data Query Delete command.andP;  This will prevent you fromaccidentally removing the wrong records.andP;  If your Criterion range does notcorrectly identify the records to delete, modify and test it until it does.andO;Another good precaution is to save your worksheet before you delete records.andO;If you make a mistake, you can retrieve the version that you saved.andM;Now select Delete from the Data Query menu.andP;  1-2-3 gives you the choice ofcancelling or proceeding with the Delete command.andP;  Select Delete from themenu to execute the command.andP;  The selected record vanishes from the database.andO;1-2-3 deleted the record and the Input range has shrunk to encompass onlyrows 4 through 11.andP;  1-2-3 adjusts the Input range's references automaticallyto account for deleted records.andP;  Confirm this by selecting Input.andP;  When yousee that the Input range has indeed contracted, press Return and select Quit.andM;The Data Query Unique command helps you to see an example of each type ofentry in a database.andP;  Like the Data Query Extract command, it copies recordsfrom the database into the Output range.andP;  The Data Query Unique commandrelies on more than just a criterion to select the records that it copies.andO;The command copies only one entry for each category of records in thedatabase.andM;You identify the breadth of information by which 1-2-3 identifies a categorywhen you assign an Output range.andP;  Currently, the Output range contains thenames of all four fields of the database.andP;  This tells 1-2-3 that all fourfields together constitute a category.andP;  So for any two records to be in thesame category, they must match exactly.andM;The database you're working with has no records that match exactly, so eachrecords defines its own category.andP;  If you select Unique from the Data Querymenu, 1-2-3 will copy every record to the Output range.andM;Try this instead: Use the Range Erase command to remove the criterion fromcell D2, then erase range A16..D17.andP;  Reduce the Output range to include onlythe field name in column B by selecting /Data Query Output and indicatingcell B15.andP;  Now select Unique.andM;Two entries appear in the Output range.andP;  By reducing the size of the Outputrange, you reduce the number of fields by which 1-2-3 identifies a category.andO;Within the Product column of the database, there are only two categories ofdata--staples and twine.andM;The Data Query Unique command serves two main purposes.andP;  With an Output rangethat matches the Input range, you can easily ferret out duplicate recordsfrom your database.andP;  When you narrow down the Output range to only one or twofields, you can quickly determine what types of entries the particular fieldor fields contain.andM;When you press the QUERY key (F7 on most computers), 1-2-3 repeats thedata-query operation you last performed.andP;  This is particularly useful whenyou wish to examine selected records and then change the selection criteriato examine other records.andM;The following steps demonstrate the QUERY key's convenience.andP;  Select Outputfrom the Data Query menu and indicate range A15..D15.andP;  Select Quit to returnto Ready mode, then enter the label North in cell A2.andP;  Select /Data QueryExtract.andP;  1-2-3 copies to the Output range all the records that contain Northin the Region field.andM;Select Quit to return to Ready mode, then change the criterion.andP;  Because youhaven't moved the cell pointer, you can simply type West and press Return.andO;Then rather than access the Data Query menu, you can simply press the QUERYkey.andP;  1-2-3 erases the Output range and copies new records into it.andP;  Changethe criterion once more by entering South in cell A2, then press QUERY onelast time.andM;The QUERY key can be used only from Ready mode.andP;  And it data-query operationyou just perfored: Find Extract, Delete, or Unique.andP;  If your last Data Querycommand was Data Query Delete and you want to find records, make sure you usethe Data Query Find command instead of pressing the QUERY key.andP;  Otherwise,you'll delete the records that you want to find.andM;Daniel Gasteiger is a 1-2-3 and Symphony consultant and a contributing editorto LOTUS.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
