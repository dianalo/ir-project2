Two of the teen-agers were in police custody today and twoothers were expected to surrender, police spokeswoman AliceMcGillion said.   The body of James Patrick Cooney, 18, was found early Wednesdayamong weeds in a Bronx park. His panicked classmates dumped hisbody there Sunday after the off-duty officer shot him once in thehead as the teen-agers fled the robbery, police said.   The teens went on a robbery spree early Sunday to raise $900 torepair a station wagon that Cooney had damaged, Ms. McGillion said.One of the young men had been afraid to tell his father that hisfriend dented the car.   ``They made some attempt to raise the money themselves, butcould only get about $100,'' she said. ``They tried to borrow themoney from someone, can't come up with the money, so they commitrobberies.''   Authorities believe at least two of the five teen-agers firstparticipated in a grocery store robbery and shot out six carwindows, Ms. McGillion sad.   At 2:10 a.m. the teen-agers tried to rob off-duty police officerDavid R. Erosa, 27, who was sitting inside his car with a date,police said.   Cooney demanded Erosa's wallet, and as the officer was reachingto give it to him, Cooney pointed a rifle at him and said, ``I'mnot fooling around, this is not a fake gun,'' according to Ms.McGillion.   He then fired the rifle, striking Erosa's car door, police said.   As the teens' car drove off, Erosa pulled a revolver and firedfive shots, shattering a car window, Ms. McGillion said. One of thebullets hit Cooney in the head and he died in the car shortlythereafter.   ``They panicked,'' she said. ``There was 20 to 30 minutes ofscreaming and carrying on in the car and panic as to what to do.''   Erosa reported the robbery and shooting on Sunday, but wasunaware his bullet had struck Cooney, she said.   The young men dumped Cooney's body in the park and then droppedone of their classmates at home. The three later burnedblood-soaked clothing in a field and used kerosene to scrub out thebloodstains on the front seat, Ms. McGillion said.   Barry Bootan, 18, was arrested at his home Tuesday after he tolda girlfriend about the killing and she told a police officer sheknew, Ms. McGillion said.   Jason Katanic, 18, surrendered Wednesday, police said.   They were charged with the attempted murder of a police officerand attempted robbery, authorities said. Bootan also was chargedwith robbery; Katanic also was charged with the unlawful use of afirearm, police said.   Cooney, Bootan, Katanic and the two other students graduatedJune 3 from Fordham Prep School, a select Catholic preparatoryschool on the campus of Fordham University. None of them hadpreviously been arrested.   The Rev. Edward Maloney, president of the prep school, describedCooney, the stepson of a police officer, as ``a fine young man,''who was planning to attend college in the fall.   ``In my book, he's the greatest kid in the world,'' Maloney said.</TEXT></DOC>
