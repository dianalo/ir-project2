BulkeleyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/07/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WANBCOMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><DATELINE> LOWELL, Mass.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wang Laboratories Inc. said it will report an operating loss of at least $35 million for its fiscal second quarter, ended Dec. 31, because of unexpectedly weak sales.    In its fiscal 1986 second quarter, Wang had net income of $21.7 million, or 15 cents a share, on revenue of $679.5 million. The company will report results Jan. 20.    To cut costs, the computer maker said it will eliminate 1,000 of its 30,900 jobs world-wide. It also will cut pay 6% for salaried U.S. employees, a move for which they will receive future compensation in the form of Wang stock.    The steps are designed to save $50 million in the next six months and help &quot;return to solid levels of profitability by the fourth quarter -- an objective which the company is determined to achieve,&quot; said Frederick A. Wang, who was named president in November.    The company's operating loss &quot;won't be significantly larger than&quot; $35 million, according to Edward Grayson, vice president and general counsel. The loss follows a $30 million fiscal first-quarter net loss, Wang's first negative quarter since the fourth quarter of fiscal 1985 when it had a net loss of $109 million and trimmed 1,600 jobs.    For the latest period, Wang is likely to take an additional charge for writing down assets, Mr. Wang said.    Industry and securities analysts, many of whom had been predicting a small loss for the quarter, said it appears likely that Wang will report a loss for the full fiscal year. In fiscal 1986, ended June 30, Wang had net income of $50.9 million, or 35 cents a share, on revenue of $2.64 billion.    In American Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Wang Laboratories Class B stock closed at $11.25, down 50 cents.    Wang's results reflect the generally weak computer market and its own special problems, analysts and consultants said. &quot;Wang's problems are more fundamental&quot; than some other companies, said Stephen Smith of PaineWebber Inc. He cited delays in delivering promised computers and software, complaints about service and growing competition from Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. in the office automation market once dominated by Wang.    Frederick Wang, who succeeded his father, chairman and chief executive officer An Wang, as president in November, said the loss occurred because expenses were too high. &quot;A lot of it has to do with a level of over-optimism that we set in anticipation things would turn around a little quicker in the industry,&quot; he said.    The company said new orders topped the record $701 million of the fiscal first quarter. In addition, orders for Wang's most powerful computer, the VS 300, rose sharply because customers became more confident that Wang had solved long-term problems with some of the computer's software, Mr. Wang said.    The executive said the job cuts reflect consolidation of certain functions, such as parts distribution and the reorganization of some jobs. He said Wang will be careful to avoid hurting service operations, which have been a sore point with some Wang customers in the past. Wang said it expects about 400 jobs will be reduced through attrition and the other 600 workers will be fired.    To make up for pay cuts for salaried employees, Wang has devised an unusual deferred stock-compensation plan. Under it, each employee whose pay is cut will receive Wang stock equal to the value of the pay reduction, half on Jan. 1, 1988, and half on Jan. 1, 1989, if he or she is still employed.    The stock value will be computed at $11.625 a share. Noting that the stock is trading far below its 1983 highs of more than $40 a share, Mr. Wang said that &quot;hopefully the stock performance will more than compensate&quot; for the deferral. Wang said it expects to distribute 1.3 million shares through the plan. It currently has about 155 million common shares outstanding.    Thomas Willmott, a consultant with International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass., consulting concern, said widespread pay cuts may be worse than job reductions because they upset everyone at the company rather than just those who lose their jobs. But Marc Schulman, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. said, &quot;I think it's smart,&quot; because if people are upset, they will leave, and &quot;the people who stay are the people who believe&quot; in Wang's future. Mr. Schulman added that the cuts in the work force are overdue because &quot;I've long believed one of Wang's underlying problems was a bloated cost structure.&quot;    Wang said that despite the work-force reductions, it plans to add about 400 sales employees, expanding its sales force 25% over the next nine months. The company said Ian Diery, its recently appointed senior vice president, U.S. operations, has told the sales force to concentrate on increasing sales of the VS 300 computer, software and other high profit-margin products. It also will try to improve sales through third parties.    Wang, however, faces challenges in all these areas. In addition to the past software problems with the VS 300, consultants say corporate customers are concerned that the computer is far less powerful than the fastest computers sold by competitors.    While Wang's office-automation software is well-regarded now it, too, was hurt by long delays after it was first announced. Wang has tried to get independent dealers to sell its computers in the past, with disappointing results. Recently, a group of those companies sued Wang for $32 million in alleged damages, claiming Wang breached a 1985 contract.    Moody's Investors Service Inc. cut its rating on $250 million of Wang debt and commercial paper in December, and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. recently placed the Wang securities on CreditWatch with negative implications.    Mr. Wang, the president, who is 36 years old and has worked at Wang since 1972, said: &quot;During its history, the company has weathered many storms, always emerging stronger in the process. I am confident (Wang will) show solid improvement in the third quarter.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
