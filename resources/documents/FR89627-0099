Box 373, St. Louis,Missouri 63166 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR75.303 (preshift examination) to its Martwick Mine (I.D. No. 15-14074)located in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. The petition is filed under section101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. A summary of the petitioner's statements follows: 1. The petition concerns the requirement that belt conveyors on which coalis carried be examined after each coal producing shift has begun. 2. As an alternate method, petitioner proposes to examine the belts beginningat 6:00 a.m. and continuing through to the first shift, thereby eliminatingthe need to walk the belts at both midnight and 8:00 a.m. 3. In support of this request, petitioner states that_ (a) The belts don't begin to run until after 6:00 a.m., which is six hoursafter the midnight shift begins; (b) The belts are only used to remove scoopings which contain coal androck; (c) No coal is mined on the midnight shift; and (d) It takes a full shift to walk the entire belt system at the mine. 4. Petitioner states that the proposed alternate method will provide thesame degree of safety for the miners affected as that afforded by the standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments </ITAG>Persons interested in this petition may furnish written comments.
