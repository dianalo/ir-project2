 (IBM seems to havecompletely forgotten that the majority of its mainstream users cut theirteeth on a mainframe operating system called DOS, and now insists on callingPC-DOS simply DOS; Computergram is more pedantic).andP;  The new program is acomponent of the IBM ImagePlus System, designed to support the conversion ofpaper-intensive applications to computer-based electronic systems.andP;  Paperdocuments are scanned and manipulated at the workstation and then transmittedto the host application for storage and on-line retrieval.andP;  The IBM PS/2ImagePlus Workstation Program is designed for high-volume image handling,enabling savings in processing cycles and reduced paper handling costs.andP;  Itsends and receives architected image data streams in compressed format;controls movement of various pages of a document including move to the next,first, previous or last page; provides viewing functions including scrolling,rotating, and magnifying images; enables concurrent display of alphanumericcoded data and image documents; provides document modification such as addinga new page to a document; and supports direct attachment of a scanner and/ora printer to the image workstation for high-speed/high-volume processing.andP;  Itcommunicates with the IBM ImagePlus host system components in the MVS/ESA,AS/400 and System/36 environments on an IBM Token-Ring Network using SNA LUType 6.2 communications protocol.andP;  The PS/2 Image Adaptor/A is also needed onthe micro.andP;  Its announcement fulfills the statement of direction made inIBM's June 28, 1988 announcement (sounds a bit like those bits in the NewTestament where events are hallowed by the writer pointing out that byhappening the way they did, they fulfilled some Old Testament prophecy).andP;  Theprogram will be available on September 29 and will cost $600 in the US.andM;Here are the promised new ImagescreensandM;Oh and IBM wants people to buy new screens for their PS/2s if they are goingto use ImagePlus.andP;  The PS/2 Monochrome Display 8508 is a horizontal 19&quot;analogue, multimode, white phosphor raster display capable of displaying upto 1,600 by 1,200 pixels at 114 pels-per-inch in a viewable area of 14.0&quot; by10.5&quot;; using the large screen enables display of either coded or non-codeddata in image and text applications.andP;  The fact that it is analogue, says IBM,increases the capability for selecting grey shades.andP;  Up to 16 out of 256shades of grey, dependent on the screen mode being used, are available whenthe thing is attached to the PS/2 Image Adaptor/A, and programmable selectionof screen resolution is supported.andP;  The display contains a self-regulatingpower supply accommodating voltage that can be used in both the US and Europe- this is a new IBM policy - make one version for the world.andP;  The thing costs$1,300 from September 29.andP;  And if you don't like that one, you can alwayswait for the PS/2 Monochrome Display 8506, a vertical or portrait 17&quot;analogue, multimode, white phosphor raster display that puts up 848 by 1,200pixels at 100 pels-per-inch in a viewable area of 8.5&quot; by 11.8&quot;, so the thingcan put up a full A4 page.andP;  All the other features are the same as for the8508 - including the $1,300 price - but the thing doesn't arrive untilDecember 29.andP;  But while the 8508 landscape monitor provides two display areason the screen, side-by-side, to handle coded data and display imagesconcurrently, users of the 8506 have to use a second monitor on the same PS/2to look at the coded data application; users of MVS/ESA can use a separateIBM 3270 terminal for the coded data.andM;Delivery dates for ImagePlus for MVS/ESA, AS/400 and System 36 usersandM;The workstation program ain't much use unless you've got the host end ofImagePlus as well, so what of the ImagePlus System MVS/ESA, AS/400 andSystem/36?andP;  Rappelons que, as they say Outre Manche, the IBM ImagePlus SystemMVS/ESA, AS/400 and System/36 consist of a set of components, includingapplication and storage management software, on-line optical storage, andPS/2-based image workstations to provide comprehensive hardware and softwaresystems to facilitate input, storage, retrieval and distribution of imagedocuments using SAA Common Communications Support.andP;  Functions are included tomanage flow of work through the system and to provide a consistent method oforganising image documents and distributing them for processing.andP;  IBM hasn'tsaid much about optical disks, although those with long memories willremember that substantial parts of the system come from Filenet Corp, CostaMesa, California.andP;  Becoming more and more incomprehensible is IBM's use ofthe term RPQ, which once stood for Request Price Quotation, and doesn't seemto mean anything very much now.andP;  The original connotation was of a productthat was a special, made available as a favour to a small group of customers,and specifically had no price attached.andP;  Now, none of those things apply, andsome of the essential parts of a full ImagePlus system are labelled RPQs.andO;Thus it is that the Optical Library Unit RPQ and the Optical Disk Drive RPQwill be available on September 29, with the MVS/ESA Direct Attachment RPQfollowing in December 29, 1989.andP;  Also out in December is MVS/ESA FolderApplication Facility 1; MVS/ESA Object Distribution Manager 1; MVS DataFacility Product 3.2; the System 36 Workfolder application is September 29,but AS/400 users must wait until March 1990.andP;  Further details of the IBMImagePlus system were given last June in CI Nos 961 and 962.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
