It was the first report that a second African had been formallyarrested in connection with the brawl that left 11 Chinese and twoAfricans injured.   The diplomat, Benin's first secretary, Gobo Bio Mamah, alsoquoted African students as saying that Chinese police stripped andtortured two students from Benin when they attacked 140 mostlyAfrican students at a guest house outside Nanking on Saturday.   ``We have heard that they were made to walk almost naked in thecold as police poked them with electric cattle prods,'' Mamah said.``They were doing this to make them talk. It appears to be torture.''   The brawl at Nanking's Hehai University sparked five days ofanti-black protests and resulted in most of the city's Africanstudents being forced by police to the guest house on Dec. 26.   The students had wanted to flee the east-central city forBeijing, but were stopped by police at Nanking's railway station.   African students said about 400 Chinese police attacked themSaturday in the guest house and removed about half of them,returning some to their universities and sending others to anotherhotel.   The student witnesses said Chinese police beat and detained sevenor eight of their classmates. One witness said police charged thestudents as loudspeakers broadcast platitudes about China's greatfriendship with African nations.   Another said he saw about seven police beating one student fromthe Congo.   Chinese news reports said only that a student from Ghana, AlexDzabaku Dosoo, had been arrested and three other students held forquestioning. No mention was made of a student from Benin.   But Mamah said officials from the Public Security Department inBeijing told him Sunday that student Ludovic Dossoumon had beensentenced without trial to 15 days in prison as ``punishment.''   Chinese authorities in Beijing refused to specify Dossoumon'salleged crimes, he said.   ``They told me the authorities in Nanking were the only ones whocould say anything,'' Mamah said. ``This action is unacceptable.''   Chinese authorities at the Ministry of Public Security said theywere ``not clear'' about the arrests.   At least 50 students from Hehai remained at the guest housetoday, apparently because they still wanted to go to Beijing. Therest apparently were at another hotel or at their universities.Jiangsu province said today that they also were ``not clear'' aboutthe arrests and the exact whereabouts of the students, some of whomwere from Western Europe, Japan and South Asia.   A Ghanian diplomat said China had broken an agreement to keep thestudents at the guest house until a delegation representing nineAfrican countries returned to Nanking.   The delegation came to Nanking last Tuesday for negotiations,returned to Beijing and was planning to go again to Nanking laterthis week.   ``We don't know why they broke the agreement,'' said thediplomat, Y.N. Ohene-Akrasi. ``But in light of the apparent policeattack this is the least of our concerns.''   Chinese officials in Nanking have made it clear that no Chinesewill be punished for the clash and subsequent demonstrations duringwhich Chinese students destroyed property in African studentdormitories and shouted, ``Down with black devils!''   In Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province, a standoff continuedbetween 56 black Africans and Chinese at the Zhejiang AgriculturalCollege. The students have locked themselves in their dormitorysince Dec. 26 because they allege Chinese officials say they havethe deadly disease AIDS.   College officials have denied the claim.   The weeklong incidents in Nanking and in Hangzhou are the latestin a series of incidents between Chinese and China's 1,500 Africanstudents, brought here to demonstrate China's solidarity with theThird World.   Relations between Chinese and Africans are tense. Chinese areoften openly racist and Africans are frustrated by a culture that isvery different from their own.</TEXT></DOC>
