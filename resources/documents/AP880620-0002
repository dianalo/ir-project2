Gen. Henri Namphy formed amilitary government Monday with himself in charge, after deposingthe 4-month-old civilian administration of President Leslie Manigat.   The 55-year-old career soldier named a 12-member Cabinet thatincluded only one civilian, and said he would rule by decree as thenew president.   ``The army will lead the country this way,'' Namphy declared onnational television shortly after the coup, waving an Uzisubmachine gun and flanked by soldiers.   Manigat, who was seized Sunday evening at his hillside villaoutside Port-au-Prince, arrived in neighboring Dominican Republicon Monday with his family, said military sources in Santo Domingo.   In a statement issued through a spokesman of the hotel whereManigat and his family were staying, the 57-year-old oustedpresident said he was not injured in the coup.   The administration of President Joaquin Balaguer gave noofficial statement, but Foreign Ministry sources said Manigat was a``guest of the Dominican government'' and might travel Tuesdayafternoon to Venezuela, where he had been offered political asylum.   Except for a few random shots heard, Port-au-Prince was quietMonday night. There were no reports of unrest in the provinces. Menand women strolled past the national palace and children playedsoccer at a closed gasoline station two blocks away.   In a short live broadcast on state-run television from theNational Palace, Namphy said Manigat ``betrayed your confidence andviolated the constitution he swore to uphold.''   ``The future of democracy was at stake,'' said the general, whowas accompanied by elements of every unit in Haiti's 7,000-memberarmed forces. ``The army must protect the superior interests of thecountry and must head the country. To this end, a militarygovernment has been formed.''   Namphy, who spoke in French for about five minutes, pledged to``guarantee that all the conquests of Feb. 7 (when his three-manjunta turned over the government to Manigat) will be respected. Toour powerful friends and to international organizations, Iguarantee the respect of all commitments.''   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said in Washington:``The United States government strongly condemns this serious blowto hopes for democracy in that troubled land.''   Namphy's action halted, at least for now, the slow journeytoward democracy begun after President Jean-Claude Duvalier fledthe country Feb. 7, 1986, ending the 29-year dictatorship foundedby his father, Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier.   The general, who was Jean-Claude Duvalier's chief of staff, ledthe junta that ruled Haiti until Manigat won a presidentialelection this year with the army's help.   Haiti, a nation of 6 million people and the poorest country inthe Western Hemisphere, shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniolawith the Dominican Republic.   Manigat began his disastrous confrontation with the army, thetraditional base of power since independence in 1804, by removingNamphy as commander on Friday. Manigat also reassigned two dozenother officers Sunday, many of them Namphy's allies.   He accused Namphy of insubordination for ordering the transfersof several officers without presidential permission, includingManigat's main military ally, Lt. Col. Jean-Claude Paul. Thebarracks of Paul's command, the 700-man Dessalines Battalion, isdirectly behind the National Palace.   Paul, who has been indicted by a U.S. federal court on chargesof drug trafficking, was in the group standing around Namphy duringthe television appearance Monday, but whether he had allied himselfwith the general was unclear.   The military announced a new Cabinet, dissolution of theNational Assembly and Namphy's intention to rule by decree.   Col. Gary Leon, general secretary of the armed forces, read thenames of the Cabinet members on television. Gen. Williams Regala,who was defense minister under Manigat and signed the orderretiring Namphy, will be minister of defense and interior.   No public opposition greeted Namphy on his first day back in thepalace. There were no rallies for Manigat, whose politicalheadquarters was ransacked.   The international airport in Port-au-Prince was closed, alongwith most schools and businesses in the capital. Car and pedestriantraffic was curtailed. Overseas telephone lines were closed downand an employee at the government telephone company, Teleco, saidNamphy ordered it.   Few soldiers were in the streets and there were no militarycheckpoints.   Namphy had been under house arrest but was freed Sunday night,apparently with aid of the presidential guard and the Leopardscounter-insurgency unit using three tanks.   Shooting began in front of the palace at about 7:30 p.m. Sundayas the presidential guard and Leopards battled Paul's DessalinesBattalion. At 1:30 a.m. Monday, Namphy announced the coup ontelevision in a broadcast from the palace.   There were no official reports on casualties but Haitianjournalists said some soldiers loyal to Manigat were killed. U.S.Embassy spokesman Jeffrey Lite said no Americans were injured.</TEXT></DOC>
