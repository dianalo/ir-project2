Nothing is worse than more condos, reasoned officials of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission. So next September, for the first time in 26 years, hunters will be able to &quot;harvest&quot; alligators legally in Florida.    The theory is that if wetlands can provide their owners with at least some economic benefits -- alligator hides currently are selling for record prices -- landowners will have an incentive to prevent overdevelopment, says Dennis N. David, a wildlife biologist in Gainesville and the game commission's alligator-program director.    But some nature lovers dismiss that reasoning. Bernard Yokel, president of the Florida Audubon Society, says it represents &quot;creative logic on the part of the hunting lobby over a few Heinekens&quot; as an excuse to resume sport hunting of alligators. Mr. Yokel says hunting was one reason alligators became an endangered species; they are now on the threatened species list.    And the reptiles might not be the only ones that get hurt, Mr. Yokel says: Allowing hunting after a 26-year break means &quot;a lot of folks who are inexperienced at manhandling gators&quot; will be on the prowl.    Mr. Yokel notes that using guns to hunt alligators will still be illegal. &quot;You have to somehow harpoon them, or bang them upside the head,&quot; he says, and novice alligator hunters may be unprepared for the face-to-face fighting. &quot;When you have a harpooned alligator, you have one disturbed creature,&quot; he says.    State game officials emphasize that hunters will have to go through &quot;orientations&quot; to get licenses. As for the animals, officials expect only about 1,500 of the one million or so alligators in the state to be harvested in the one-month season.    That wouldn't mean a big jump in the hazards of being a Florida alligator. Already, about 1,000 of the animals are killed each year for research; another 3,000 annually, by the state's &quot;nuisance-alligator&quot; patrol. Nuisance alligators are those that show up in swimming pools, parking lots, private lakes -- even front porches.    Nuisance trappers have some advice for sport hunters: Watch your hide. &quot;With an alligator, you're gonna be in his lake,&quot; says Joseph &quot;Mike&quot; Fagan, president of the Florida Alligator Trappers Association. There's no question you can get killed, he says, &quot;if you're fool enough.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
