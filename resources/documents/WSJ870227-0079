One believer is Felix Zulauf, chief world-wide investment strategist for Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich. He expects the weak dollar to allow U.S. multinational corporations to recapture lost markets, raise prices and boost profits. He also believes that the U.S. stock market will continue to soar.    Mr. Zulauf isn't alone. Foreign investors are finding many reasons to buy U.S. equities, from the shares of brewer Anheuser-Busch Cos. to those of aircraft maker Boeing Co.    The sums that foreigners invest aren't large enough by themselves to move the U.S. market, analysts say. But expectations of foreign buying can prompt Americans to purchase stocks. It's a case of keeping up with the Joneses abroad, or, in the words of Kermit L. Schoenholtz, a Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst, &quot;trying to do what the Japanese do.&quot;    More significant, many analysts view the U.S. market as relatively undervalued because it has lagged behind foreign counterparts for the past three years. The 39-year-old Mr. Zulauf predicts that the Dow Jones Industrial Average could soar to the high 2000s, driven by an easy U.S. monetary policy and expectations of strong corporate profits.    Through last year's first three quarters, foreigners increased their holdings of U.S. equities $18.3 billion. Heiko H. Thieme, an executive vice president at Deutsche Bank Capital Corp. in New York, estimates the final tally for all of 1986 was between $23 billion and $25 billion, up sharply from $5 billion in 1985. And Salomon Brothers estimates that foreigners, who began 1987 with about $175 billion in their portfolios, will add $35 billion this year.    &quot;The depreciation of the dollar has made the whole country look cheap to foreigners,&quot; says Scott E. Pardee, vice chairman of Yamaichi International (America) Inc. A falling dollar means that a foreign investor needs less of his own currency to buy U.S. shares.    Keiji Tsuda, a vice president at Nippon Life Insurance Co. in New York, likes U.S. drug stocks. &quot;People tend to live longer and aged people need more medical care,&quot; he notes. Moreover, he says, &quot;wealthy people can afford to buy expensive drugs,&quot; and the pharmaceutical industry will benefit from recent advances in biotechnology.    A fund manager for Murray Johnstone Ltd. in Glasgow, Scotland, is buying a number of U.S. stocks, including chemical companies such as Dow Chemical Co. and Du Pont Co., paper producers such as James River Corp., and companies aided by a weaker dollar such as the industrial equipment makers Ingersoll-Rand Co. and Cooper Industries Inc.    The Glasgow manager, Carol A. Biggart, expects U.S. manufacturers to benefit &quot;as importers find it more difficult to compete&quot; and as the U.S. companies export more. She adds that rising industrial production should &quot;help the local economies and employment, which boosts consumer spending.&quot;    German investors, according to Mr. Thieme of Deutsche Bank, &quot;like the big names, the blue chips.&quot; International Business Machines Corp., Westinghouse Electric Corp., General Electric Co., Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., and United Technologies Corp. &quot;are the names you traditionally find in German portfolios,&quot; he says.    In addition, German investors are wading into the equities of fast-food chains, semiconductor companies and stockbrokers, including McDonald's Corp., Motorola Inc., National Semiconductor Corp. and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.    Currency movements are a major concern for foreign investors. Because of the dollar's declines of 47% against the West German mark and 42% against the yen, &quot;The German and Japanese investors haven't made much money since March 1985,&quot; Mr. Thieme says. The problem is that portfolio gains, as measured in U.S. dollars, are eroded when translated into the investors' home currencies.    But many foreign money managers now think the dollar won't go much lower, greatly reducing the risk of investing in the U.S.    &quot;The dollar is within 10% of bottoming out, and it is a good time to buy U.S. stocks because the earnings potential of American companies and foreign shareholders is greater than the currency risk,&quot; says Gabriel Marcus, president of DG Securities Services Corp., a New York broker that is a subsidiary of a group of German banks.    Not everyone is bullish. Henry B.W. deVismes, a director of Kleinwort, Benson International Investment Ltd. in London, contends: &quot;There's been rather a hype about foreign buying in the U.S. market.&quot; He points to several issues that could scare away foreigners, including President Reagan's health, the impact of the Iran arms affair, and whether Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker stays in office.    But Mrs. Biggart of Murray Johnstone believes that higher U.S. industrial output and a narrower trade deficit will help boost the dollar toward year's end. Such a development could entice foreigners, particularly the cash-rich Japanese.    Japan has one of the industrial world's highest savings rates, a huge current account surplus and low domestic returns, so Japanese institutions have been investing abroad at a record pace. This year, Salomon Brothers predicts, they will accelerate their move into U.S. equities away from bonds. The current account includes trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers.    Analysts note that U.S. stocks look cheap to Japanese investors because of the strong yen, a slowing Japanese economy and price-earnings ratios on Japanese shares that are about four times those on U.S. equities.    For Japanese investors, &quot;This is the market,&quot; adds Takashi Harino, a senior vice president at Nomura Securities Co.'s U.S. unit. &quot;It's the only market other than (Japan's) own that can absorb the kinds of money they are investing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
