Among the most controversial provisions will be one pushedfor two years by President Bush: expansion of the federaldeath penalty, limits on death-row appeals, and legal changesthat would allow juries to consider illegally seizedevidence. Senior Democrats mutter privately that none ofthese will make the streets any safer. But the mainDemocratic strategy is to propose modified versions ofessentially the same measures to demonstrate that they, too,are tough on crime.</LP><TEXT>   Democrats have some proposals of their own, particularlyon gun control and increased aid to local law enforcementefforts. But after all of the speeches and closed-doornegotiations, the crime debate easily could end in stalemate,as it did last year, when the controversial provisions wereabandoned. (The House last month passed a national, seven-daywaiting period for handgun purchases, but otherwise it islagging behind the Senate this year in considering anti-crimelegislation.)   This week's Senate action will begin with debate on anomnibus bill sponsored by Judiciary Chairman Joseph Biden(D., Del.). Here is a preview of the clashes to follow:                                                                                                          HANDGUNS. Gun-control proponents celebrated when SenateMajority Leader George Mitchell endorsed the idea of amandatory waiting period for anyone seeking to buy a gun,combined with a background check. The Maine Democrat alsoproposed providing $40 million to help states improve theirrecord-keeping on criminal activity. Mr. Mitchell risked thewrath of hunters from his home state as well as that of thepowerful National Rifle Association, but so far his actionhasn't attracted a single additional vote in the Senate for amandatory waiting period. Gun control advocates acknowledgethey may lose this battle.                                                                                                          ASSAULT RIFLES. Senate Democrats defeated the NRA lastyear by narrowly winning passage in their chamber of alimited ban on nine types of military-style semiautomaticweapons. (That measure later died.) The Democrats are backagain with a list of 14 assault weapons, but their side maybe weaker because three seats have changed hands and a coupleof other senators are getting cold feet. Gun control expertsacknowledge that regulating semiautomatics is largelysymbolic anyway; the huge majority of gun-related crimesinvolve old-fashioned revolvers, such as sixshot .38 calibermodels.                                                                                                          CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. Democrats prefer to join theiropponents rather than fight on this issue. As a result, theSenate probably will expand the federal death penalty toinclude at least 40 additional crimes. But proponents makequite a stretch in arguing that the new provisions woulddeter much street crime. The legislation potentially wouldapply to no more than a couple of dozen defendants a year,according to Democrats. Most of the crimes involved are farfrom common: killing someone by purposely wrecking a train,for example, or assassinating a Supreme Court justice.                                                                                                          DEATH-ROW APPEALS. The administration, arguing thatcondemned inmates' constitutional appeals are clogging thecourt system and subverting death sentences, is pushing evenmore extreme curbs than it did last year. The American BarAssociation has said the Bush proposal &quot;would virtuallyeliminate the federal courts' authority&quot; to hear appeals onceissues have been considered by state courts. Democrats wantlimits, too, provided prisoners get competent lawyers; theDemocrats' limits would be less strict than those proposed bythe Republicans, though.                                                                                                          ILLEGAL EVIDENCE. Here, too, the White House is taking atougher stance than it did last year. In addition toproposing more circumstances under which juries couldconsider evidence obtained illegally by police, theadministration would make firearms always admissable asevidence, regardless of how the government gets them. TheDemocrats would codify a Supreme Court ruling that allowsjury consideration of illegally obtained evidence, but onlywhere police have sought a warrant and acted in &quot;good faith.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
