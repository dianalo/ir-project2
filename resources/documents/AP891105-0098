Danny Wall took over as the nation'stop savings and loan regulator on July 1, 1987, he swiftly orderedthe heavy glass door leading to his office propped open.   A trim, balding man with a neatly trimmed beard and a fondnessfor three-piece suits, Wall intended his move to be a symbolicchange from the way his predecessor, Edwin Gray, conducted affairsat the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.   But the gesture instead has become a symbol of the turbulenceWall has encountered during his tenure at what is now the Office ofThrift Supervision. Three times in 16 months the man who walkedthrough the door was Phoenix, Ariz., millionaire Charles H. KeatingJr., head of a California-based savings and loan that collapsed atan expected cost to the taxpayers of $1.5 billion to $2 billion.   ``My method of operation ... is if somebody wants to talk to me,I'm going to listen to them,'' Wall said, defending his handling ofLincoln Savings and Loan Association. ``... You can't close yourdoor to your constituents,'' added the 50-year-old regulator, whocame to Washington as an aide to GOP Sen. Jake Garn of Utah.   But even leaving the Lincoln case aside, Wall has absorbed hisshare of criticism, first for refusing to admit the need for amultibillion dollar bailout until after George Bush had won the1988 presidential election.   Second, critics fault the Sandamp;L rescue deals Wall put together ina headlong rush at the end of last year, committing the governmentto spending some $40 billion Congress had not yet appropriated.   But it is his handling of the Lincoln case, the nation's largestthrift failure, that has generated the fiercest attacks, includinga call to resign from House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B.Gonzalez, D-Texas. Wall says he won't quit, and is expected totestify later this month before the House panel.   In three hearings this fall, the committee has compiled reams oftestimony focusing on Wall's decision to ignore a 1987recommendation by his agency's San Francisco office to take controlof Lincoln _ a decision that ultimately delayed the seizure untilApril of this year.   Wall, in a recent interview, said he realizes now that Lincolnexecutives were engaged in an intentional effort to hide theirallegedly fraudulent activities. But he said his decision to meetwith the politically influential Keating _ a heavy contributor tothe election campaigns of five senators, four Democrats and oneRepublican _ was proper.   M. Danny Wall, the M stands for Melvin, arrived in Washington in1975 as the top aide to the newly elected Garn. His fortunes rosewith Garn, and when Republicans took control of the Senate in 1980,Garn became chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and Wallbecame staff director.   In the Senate, Wall acquired a reputation as energetic, bright,accessible and straightforward, willing to meet with the financialindustry interest groups, even when he and his boss were pushinglegislation they opposed.   ``You could always go out with Danny and have a drink withDanny. ... He did a good job,'' recalled Kenneth A. Guenther,executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association ofAmerica.   After Republicans lost control of the Senate in 1986, Wall beganto look for a command of his own. With Gray's term ending, theWhite House was looking for someone with the political skillsnecessary to deal with Congress and the Sandamp;L industry in the roughperiod ahead.   Wall was confirmed with bipartisan support, but it didn't takelong for the honeymoon to deteriorate. He became known for hisever-escalating estimate of the scope of the savings and loandebacle and his credibility in Congress suffered.   Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va., apersistent _ and ultimately accurate _ critic of Wall's assessmentof the industry's condition, said Wall is unsuited by temperamentand professional background for the ``tough cop'' role of topregulator.   ``You have to really be a tough person and you have to bewilling to sit down with a guy eyeball-to-eyeball and say, `I'mgoing to take your business away from you,''' Ely said. ``I don'tthink Danny had that in him.''   Indeed, according to Barton Naylor, a former Democratic aide onthe banking committee, Democratic staffers discovered when Wallleft that the first number on his telephone speed dial was to alobbyist for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions.   Gonzalez's committee plans at least three more hearings onLincoln, and has scheduled an appearance from Wall on Nov. 21.Despite the steady drumbeat of negative publicity, Wall has noplans to resign and said he will be vindicated by the public whenhe gets a chance to tell his side of the story.   ``I'm not saying we're lily white in the situation, not atall,'' Wall said. ``... But fair play clearly has not been evident,much less due process.''   Ely predicted Wall will hang on as long as he has Garn's support.   ``Jake is very loyal to people who have been loyal to him,'' hesaid. ``I don't think the administration is going to lean on Dannyto resign because they don't want to offend the ranking minoritymember on the Senate Banking Committee. They need him too much.''   Garn, in a telephone interview, said House Democrats, who bowedto lobbyists by refusing to force the Sandamp;L industry to pay for itsown bailout in 1986, are looking for a scapegoat.   ``In all the years I've been in Washington, I've never knownanybody who's been more honest than Dan Wall. It's too bad some ofhis detractors don't show equal devotion to the truth,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
