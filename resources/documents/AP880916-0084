On Thursday, the government imposed emergency laws to curbstrikes by Sinhalese militants who oppose an accord aimed at endingfive years of bloodshed in the northern and eastern provinces.   President Junius R. Jayawardene's government invoked theemergency laws declaring all shops, transport and health agenciesas essential services.   Any essential services that close without the government'spermission may be indefinitely shut down or seized, it said.   The moves follow a nationwide strike Monday called by the JanataVimukti Peramuna, or People's Liberation Front, to protest thedeath of a Sinhalese lawyer while in police custody.   The strike paralyzed businesses and public transport nationwide.The government contends most businesses closed because of threatsby Sinhalese militants.   The front is the most militant Sinhalese group. It has vowed tokill anyone who supports the peace agreement that would grantTamils limited autonomy in the northern and eastern provinces andend their war for a separate nation.   At least 500 people, including members of the governing UnitedNational Party, have been killed by Sinhalese militants.   Sri Lanka last week merged the two provinces, which the Tamilsclaim as their homeland, and said a provincial council would bechosen later to take over administrative duties now handled by thefederal government.   The merger is a key provision of the peace accord, signed byIndia and Sri Lanka in July 1987. India, which has an estimated47,000 troops stationed on the island, became involved in theconflict because 60 million Tamils living in southern India aresympathetic to the rebels' cause.   Sinhalese militants contend the accord grants too manyconcessions to the Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of the island's16 million people.   Tamils, mostly Hindu, claim they are discriminated against bythe Sinhalese, mostly Buddhists, who make up 75 percent of thepopulation and control the government and the military.</TEXT></DOC>
