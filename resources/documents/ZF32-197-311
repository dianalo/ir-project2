In both cases HP isreplacing a 68000-family microprocessor with a RISC processor.andP;  In the caseof the workstation, HP is going to RISC to get more performance than a 68040can provide; for the laser printer, HP is moving to a RISC processor, insteadof to the 68040, for a more cost-effective solution.andP;  HP also gains someindependence from Motorola, which must seem very attractive after havingwatched its workstation business being held captive by Motorola's delays ingetting the 68040 into production.andM;On the same day as HP's announcement of its highend laser printer, Appleannounced two new printers aimed directly at the low end of HP's line.andP;  The$599 Style Writer is a 360-dpi ink-jet printer, and prints at a sluggish 0.5page per minute.andP;  The $1299 Personal LaserWriter LS uses the 300-dpi, 4-ppmCanon LX engine.andP;  Both printers connect to the processor's serial port and donot support AppleTalk.andP;  They are the first products to use Apple's new fonttechnology, TrueType, which is implemented in software drivers that run onthe Macintosh.andM;The two new printers replace the 68000 microprocessor used in Apple'sprevious low-end laser printers with a controller ASIC-the printers don't usea microprocessor, which eliminates the program memory as well.andP;  Since allfont generation and rasterization is done in the Macintosh, the processingneeds are minimal.andP;  In addition to printer control functions, the ASICimplements a decompression algorithm to reduce the amount of data that mustbe transmitted and stored.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
