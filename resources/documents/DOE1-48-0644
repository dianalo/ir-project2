We havemeasured the thermal conductivity of ErAl{sub 2}, T{sub 0} = 12 K, between5 and 170 K in 0- and 7-T applied magnetic fields. The zero-field resultsshow a strong, 20-K-wide minimum in the thermal conductivity near theordering temperature. The results at 7 T indicate that the magnetic fieldeliminates the minimum and produces a monotonic temperature dependence.We attribute these effects to magnetic scattering of electrons.</TEXT></DOC>
