While the navies of England, France and China also are``nuclearized,'' possessing a combined 642 nuclear warheads, it isthe two superpowers which are responsible for the large warheadcount, the study said.   As of last December, the United States had 9,277 nuclearwarheads assigned to its Navy, while the Soviet Union had 6,152 forits fleet. Of those superpower totals, 6,350 of the warheads areshort-range, ``non-strategic'' weapons that are not covered by anytype of arms control treaty, the study found.   The study, ``Nuclear Warships and Naval Nuclear Weapons: AComplete Inventory,'' was published by the Institute for PolicyStudies and the environmental group Greenpeace.   It was authored by William M. Arkin, the director of thenational security program at the institute, and a researchassociate, Joshua Handler. The institute is a liberal think tankbased in Washington that frequently has criticized theadministration's military policies.   The study lists the individual ships in the five navies thathave been certified to carry or fire nuclear weapons, and Arkinpredicted it could accelerate international debate about allowingnuclear-armed ships to make port calls.   The 95-page report, by providing such specific information, alsoattacks the official U.S. Navy policy of never confirming ordenying the presence of nuclear weapons, Arkin said.   ``The Navy argument that the policy bolsters deterrence is justbaloney'' because the ships certified to carry nuclear weapons canbe identified, Arkin said.   ``I don't think many people have any idea that here are 16,000nuclear warheads at sea _ one-quarter to one-third of the total inthe world,'' he continued.   ``But the naval proliferation (of nuclear weapons) is becoming amatter of concern to foreign governments. And I believe there is agrowing interest and sense that controls are needed for navalnuclear weapons,'' Arkin said.   According to the report, the five navies currently deploy 14types of long-range ballistic missiles on 17 types of submarines.That combined arsenal of strategic weaponry now totals 1,792missiles with 9,487 warheads.   On the non-strategic, or short-range, side, the largest singlecategory of nuclear weaponry is deployed for anti-submarinewarfare. According to Arkin, there are now 3,300 such ASW weaponsin the fleets of the United States, Soviet Union and Britain.   Short-range nuclear weapons also have been deployed for useagainst enemy aircraft, other ships and targets on land, the studysaid. The United States and Soviet Union so far have deployed acombined 548 nuclear warheads on sea-launched cruise missiles andanother 541 warheads on anti-aircraft missiles.   ``The nuclear arms race at sea is long-standing, andaccelerating,'' the study concluded. ``As of the end of 1987, 1,101ships and submarines and over 3,250 aircraft (could) fire,transport or service one or more of these nuclear weapons.   ``And all of the nuclear powers have on-going nuclear researchand development programs and are producing new naval nuclearweapons, as well as the ships, aircraft and missiles that carry orlaunch nuclear warheads.''</TEXT></DOC>
