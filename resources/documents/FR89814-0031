The proposed AD is neededto detect a cracked main rotor upper hub plate, which could result in theloss of the helicopter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before September 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments on the proposal may be mailed in duplicateto: Rules Docket, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, FAA, Fort Worth,Texas 76193-0007, or delivered in duplicate to the Office of the AssistantChief Counsel, 4400 Blue Mound Road, Room 158, Building 3B, Forth Worth,Texas.

Communications should identify the regulatorydocket number and be submitted in duplicate to the address specified above.All communications received on or before the closing date for commentswill be considered by the FAA before any final action is taken on the proposedrule. The proposal contained in this notice may be changed in light ofcomments received.Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic,environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submittedwill be available, both before and after the closing date for comments,in the Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel for examination by interestedpersons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact, concerned with thesubstance of the proposed AD, will be filed in the Rules Docket.Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submittedin response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcardon which the following statement is made: Comments to Docket No. 89-ASW-29.The postcard will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter.The FAA has received reports of cracks occurring in Sikorsky S-61 mainrotor upper hub plates starting from the bifilar attachment bolt hole.The cause of the cracking is attributed to improper clearance between thebifilar lug and main rotor hub. The excessive clearance which is beyondthe recommended drawing clearance allows the bifilar attachment bolt topreload the upper hub plate walls, thereby causing premature cracking inthe hub attachment hole. Since this condition is likely to exist or developon other helicopters of the same type design. The proposed AD would requirea one-time inspection for clearance of the bifilar to upper plate attachmentand a one-time inspection of the main rotor upper hub plate for crackswhich start from any of the five bifilar attachment bolt holes on SikorskyModel S-61 series helicopters.The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation would only involve32 aircraft at an approximate cost of $240 per aircraft for the initialbifilar lug clearance check and $60 per aircraft for the inspection forcracking around the five bifilar attachment holes. Therefore, I certifythat this action (1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291;(2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); (3) does not warrant preparation of aregulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal; and (4)if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive ornegative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteriaof the Regulatory Flexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Adminsitration proposes to amend andSection; 39.13 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:1.
