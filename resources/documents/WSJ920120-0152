The company's union voted last week to strike at the Ulsanfactory -- where all of the company's cars are made --because of a dispute over bonus payments and the arrest ofseveral workers. Unionists, who Thursday seized the factory,said they fear the 12,000 riot police surrounding the complexwill soon attack to smash the strike. Attempts Friday toreach a settlement were unsuccessful, union and companyspokesmen said. Talks resumed Sunday.</LP><TEXT>   Hyundai said it fears that strikers may attempt tosabotage the plant. They said the factory has produced almostno vehicles since mid-December, when workers began a workslowdown.   A company spokesman said Hyundai dealers in the U.S. haveabout two months of inventory, so for now, they likely won'tbe affected by the strike. A parts depot in California isalso well-stocked, the spokesman said.   However, the strike could pose problems for Hyundai'scrucial expansion into Europe. For example, the company hasreceived 7,800 orders from customers in Germany, where itbegan selling cars late last year, but has been unable toship any cars since November.   Hyundai was producing about 20,000 cars a month for exportat Ulsan, but accumulated orders for 37,000 cars remainunfilled. The company fears that many of these overseasorders will be rescinded if the strike continues.</TEXT></DOC>
