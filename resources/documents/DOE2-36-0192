<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-36-0192 </DOCNO><TEXT>A D/sup +/ beam of kinetic energy T/sub i/=0.7 MeV was stored in a 'simplemirror' magnetic field in self-colliding orbits or migma and neutralizedby ambient, oscillating electrons whose bounce frequencies were externallycontrolled. Space charge density was exceeded by an order of magnitudewithout instabilities. Nondestructive diagnostic measurements of ionorbit distributions, ion storage times, ion energy distributions, nuclearreaction rate, and reaction product spectrum. The proton energy spectrumfor d+d -andgt; T+p+4 MeV shows that dd collided at an average crossing angleof 160/sup o/. Evidence for exponential density buildup has been observed.Relative to Migma III results and measured in terms of the product ofion energy E, density n, and confinement time tau, device performancewas improved by a factor of 500. Using the central fast ion density,we obtained the triple product: Tntau {approx_equal} 4 x 10/sup 14/ keVs cm/sup -3/, which is greater than that of the best fusion devices.The luminosity (collision rate per unit cross section) was {approx_equal}10/sup 29/ cm/sup -2/ s/sup -1/, with 0.7 A ion current through the migmacenter. The stabilizing features are: large Larmor radius; small canonicalangular momentum; short axial length z (disc shape); nonadiabatic motionsin r and z; precession and energy spread; ambipolar potential; radialdensity gradient; large ion-to-electron temperature ratio; metal wallsin z; suitability for external stabilization techniques (small volume,recurrent surfacing of ions); and particularly diamagnetic well. Extrapolationof the results to reactor densities led to a D+/sup 3/He reactor 'basicmigma disc' 0.5 m in diameter and 0.25 m thick, suspended in a 10 T field,generating 1.5 MW(th). A 2-MW(e) power plant would consist of 3 suchdiscs in a common volume, a triplet migmacell. Its specific power isprojected to be 1 MW(e)/ton.</TEXT></DOC>
