It came out of nowhere last fall to win the 1996 SummerOlympics. In recent months, Holiday Inn Worldwide and UnitedParcel Service decided to call Atlanta home, and the localLockheed Corp. plant won a coveted contract to build the nextfighter jet. Even the Atlanta Braves are winning.</LP><TEXT>   But beneath the surface, Atlanta is floundering. It'ssuffering more from the recession than most other parts ofthe country, and many economists have begun predicting thatits recovery will occur later and more slowly.   A city that has been crawling with developers for the lasthalf-decade, Atlanta now finds itself in the midst of a deepreal estate slump. A city that defines its neighborhoods byits shopping malls is also in a retail slump. A city thatonce boasted that its airport was the busiest in the worldhas lost Eastern Airlines, one of the two major airlines thatmade it that way. And the city's service sector has not beenstrong enough to offset the setbacks.   &quot;The fundamental structure of the city, the basic support,has been damaged in the last pullback,&quot; says DonaldRatajczak, who directs the Economic Forecasting Center atGeorgia State University.   The downturn has been a shock to a metropolitan area that,as recently as last fall, had been confident that it couldget through this downturn unscathed. Atlanta barely noticedthe early-1980s recession, and through the rest of thedecade, it was one of the brightest stars of the Sunbelt. Itseconomic and population growth greatly outpaced the nation'sand made Georgia a fast-growing state.   &quot;There was a general belief that Georgia was morerecession-resistant than most other states,&quot; says economistJeffery Humphreys of the University of Georgia. &quot;That'sobviously been debunked.&quot;   Many people remain confident that Atlanta will bounce backstrongly. The city's warm climate, relatively low land andliving costs, and its position as a distribution point forthe South, still make it attractive to corporations lookingto expand and relocate. The Atlanta Chamber of Commerce saysit has received 20% more inquiries this year than last year.The local housing and retail markets are showing signs oflife. And the place is abuzz with preparations for theOlympics, which are expected to start lifting the economy by1993.   &quot;Atlanta has had it so good that when it has it bad, thenaysayers come unglued,&quot; says Wayne D. Gantt, chief economistfor Interstate/Johnson Lane, Charlotte, N.C. He believes thata recovery is already under way.   Still, personal and business bankruptcies in the Atlantaarea rose 40% in the first six months, nearly twice thenational rate. Georgia's personal income growth lagged therest of the Southeast in the first quarter, largely as aresult of the loss of manufacturing jobs in Atlanta.Construction jobs are drying up as home-building ebbs andlarge commercial projects in the downtown near completion.   Mr. Ratajczak now predicts Atlanta will lose 13,500 jobsthis year, twice the number he predicted in May. He believesthe state's economy will contract 1.8% this year, while thenational economy expands 0.4%. Population migration intoGeorgia will &quot;virtually cease&quot; next year, he says.   Mr. Humphreys believes Georgia will lose 30,000 jobs thisyear, compared with the 8,000 he was predicting in May. &quot;Therecovery will be very weak and very risky,&quot; he says. &quot;There'sno major engine of growth in the state to propel it.&quot;   Like many other places, Atlanta was badly overbuilt. Itsoffice vacancy rate is about 20% and rising, according toCarter andamp; Associates, an Atlanta real estate firm. Whilethat's not much worse than the rest of the country, it hastaken the steam out of development, which had been one of thecity's big growth engines. Developers say it could take atleast two years for significant office construction to beginagain.   The biggest shock, however, has been the vulnerability ofother areas that had long been fueling Atlanta's growth. Thedemise of Eastern Airlines in January has had a huge impacton the area. It was one of the area's major employers, andHartsfield Atlanta International Airport was its hub. Inaddition to wiping out about 8,000 jobs overnight, theairline's failure has also had a big ripple effect onsuppliers. And it has left Delta as Atlanta's only othermajor airline.   It is too soon to tell whether the loss of Eastern hashurt the area's travel and convention business. But thatsector too has suffered recently, as companies have cut theirtravel budgets and as lower-cost alternatives such asOrlando, Fla., have gained favor, economists say. A survey bythe Pannell, Kerr, Forster accounting firm shows occupancyrates for Atlanta's downtown convention hotels down 8.2% thisyear -- and down 20.8% in June.   Many are worried about continued losses of finance jobs asNCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C., moves to acquire Atlanta-basedCandamp;S/Sovran Corp. Although NCNB Chairman Hugh L. McColl Jr. istaking pains to reassure Atlanta's business community,economists believe local accounting and law firms will likelylose business, at the least.   On top of all this, the state, which had been gamblingthat Atlanta's growth would continue, found itself with a$415 million budget deficit. The Legislature yesterday passeda budget that will cut nearly 3,000 state jobs. Someeconomists believe that jolt alone could delay Atlanta'srecovery.   Atlanta has traditionally drawn jobseekers from around theSoutheast. But other cities in the region seem to be doingbetter, for the moment. New Orleans, Memphis, Tenn., andBirmingham, Ala., all gained jobs while Atlanta's labor forcedropped 1.53% in the 12 months ended this June, according toa study released this week by Salomon Brothers Inc.   Stacy Kottman, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bankin Atlanta, believes Atlanta will still outperform the restof the country economically in the 1990s, but not by as much.And it won't have the same power as a magnet for newresidents. &quot;The regional playing field is much more level inthe 1990s then it was in the 1970s or 1980s,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
