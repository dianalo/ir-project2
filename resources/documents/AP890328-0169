(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prosecutors and police came under sharpcriticism Tuesday following dismissal of criminal charges against amother and grandmother accused of forcing two young children intoprostitution.   The case against Katherine Hubert, 29, of El Cerrito, and GlendaPhillips, 48, of Concord, fell apart when Hubert's childrenadmitted they made up the story that has kept their mother in jailsince January 24.   Hubert remains charged with a single count of felony childendangerment. The dropped charges carried possible prison terms ofmore than 400 years.   Hubert's 12-year-old daughter had claimed she was forced to havesex more than 100 times with men, while her 9-year-old brotheralleged he was made to perform more than 60 sexual acts with women.   Municipal Court Judge Bessie Dreibelbis agreed to drop 58 of 59criminal counts against Hubert and also dismissed the singlepandering charge against Phillips.   Public Defender Oscar Bobrow said refusal of the DistrictAttorney's Office to drop the remaining count was ``outrageous''and ``irresponsible.''   ``What's going on is (the District Attorney's Office) is losingface,'' Bobrow said following Monday's decision. ``They needsomething to hold onto.''   Bobrow criticized the prosecutor's office for filing unsupportedcharges and the Police Department for making several arrests inconnection with the case.   However, Deputy District Attorney Pat Sepulveda said the oneremaining charge of child endangerment is not related to theprostitution allegations and is based on evidence of parentalneglect and lack of supervision. The children have been in fosterhomes since May.   Hubert was released from jail Monday night after she posted$3,000 bail. A hearing on the lone charge is scheduled forWednesday.   ``While the tremendous inconvenience to all parties caused bythese allegations is regrettable, justice has been served by theearly resolution of this case,'' said District Attorney Gary Yanceyin a prepared statement.   Yancey said the children had lied to prevent their mother fromgaining custody of their two younger sisters, ages 2 and 4. Thechildren's guardian told prosecutors last weekend that the childrenadmitted concocting the prostitution story.   When the charges were filed, both children had given consistentaccounts in separate interviews, one of the suspects had confessedto a molestation and medical evidence indicated they had beensexually abused, said Sepulveda.   Charges against several people accused of being customers havebeen or will be dropped or re-evaluated, Sepulveda said. One man,who had spent almost two months in jail, was released Friday,prosecutors said.   Police Lt. Ray Howard defended the department's handling of thecase.   ``You cannot go into a crime investigation of this naturefeeling the victims are lying to you,'' Howard said. ``That belief,coupled with the fact that we do have evidence that some sexualtrauma did occur, led us to make the investigation.''   Bobrow said Hubert was delighted at the developments and thatshe had always contended the allegations were false.</TEXT></DOC>
