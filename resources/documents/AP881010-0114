While no final deal was struck in weekend talks in New York,Cuban officials suggested they were willing to step up the pace ofwithdrawal from the 2,000 a month they had proposed, said theofficials, speaking on condition of anonymity.   South Africa had demanded that 8,000 a month quit Angola, wherethe Cubans are helping a Soviet-backed government defend itselfagainst guerrillas armed by the United States and South Africa.   The Cuban officials also indicated they were willing to step upthe pace of withdrawing the 16,000 to 18,000 troops stationed nearthe border with Namibia, or South-West Africa, the U.S. sourcessaid.   The twin issues have been major sticking points in working out asettlement.   But the U.S. officials said negotiators would have to meet againand that ``further significant decisions will be required'' beforea final agreement was concluded.   The talks were held over the weekend and involved officials fromAngola, Cuba, South Africa and the United States.   There already was a tentative understanding that the Cubantroops would withdraw over 24 to 30 months. Some trainers willremain behind to assist the Angolan forces fight the guerrillas.   However, the question was whether the withdrawal would be``front-end-loaded'' _ a sizable pullout in the early stages tomake the retreat irreversible _ and how quickly the troops near theNamibian border would leave.   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said furthertalks would be held soon but that it may not be possible to reachthe Nov. 1 deadline set by the United Nations for transition toindependence for Namibia.   In Johannesburg, Roland Darroll, a Foreign Affairs spokesman,said South Africa, Cuba and Angola had agreed that Cuban troopsshould be withdrawn from Angola within 24 to 30 months.   ``That was the agreement in Brazzaville, (Congo). It was subjectto consultation with the governments,'' Darroll said.   He said he had no further information.   South Africa has linked its willingness to cooperate with aone-year independence plan for Namibia, which it rules, to thewithdrawal of the Cuban troops. The Pretoria government pulled itssoldiers out of Namibia earlier this year and says Cuba's forcesthreaten the territory's independence.   Diplomats involved in the talks had said they were workingtoward reaching agreement on a Cuban withdrawal timetable at aformal meeting to be held sometime later this month in Congo.   That meeting will be crucial because the negotiators are runningout of time to achieve a compromise before Nov. 1. South Africa hassuggested that date for putting into effect the U.N.'s independenceplan for Namibia.</TEXT></DOC>
