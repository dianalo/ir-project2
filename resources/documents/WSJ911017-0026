This new column will supplement the paper's existingtechnology coverage by reviewing issues and products ofpractical importance to readers, from the user's viewpoint.                                                                                                          Personal computers are just too hard to use, and it isn'tyour fault.   The computer industry boasts that its products can helpeveryone become more productive. Maybe so. But many peoplecan't afford the time and money needed to get the most out ofPCs.   Sure, there are exceptions. Everyone knows a PC addict whogives advice all around. But these wizards often spend hourson their hobby to hone their skills. And there are those whouse a specific program like the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet allday and can make it sing. But even these people tend toconquer only one package.   For most people, getting the fullest use out of computerproducts means training classes, books and the like. This isan unusual phenomenon in the history of consumer technology.There are no user groups or seminars for owners of, say,televisions or toaster ovens.   You can speed the learning process, but it may require agreater initial investment. If you buy an Apple ComputerMacintosh, you'll find that powerful software can berelatively easy to master because even complex functions arecontrolled by manipulating pictures on the screen, or through&quot;menus&quot; listing commands that vary little from program toprogram. But the powerful Macintosh models often are costlierthan heavily discounted International Business Machinesclones.   Some of the Macintosh's simplicity and consistency can beobtained on IBM-compatible computers by using MicrosoftWindows, special software that lets you control the computerusing Macintosh-type screens and commands. But despite thehype in many computer magazines, Windows runs poorly onmillions of older PCs. And it requires lots of memory andlarge hard-disk drives to operate at its best, even on newercomputers.   What about those who would like to get more out of theircomputers without breaking the bank? Here's a sampling ofrelatively inexpensive products that can increaseproductivity by demystifying common tasks, organizing yourwork or juicing up your hardware. Each is readily availablefor around $100 or less at popular mail-order houses ordiscount stores.   To be sure, each of these items has good and usefulcompetitors. But I've found these six to be reliable and easyto master.                                                                                                          Menu Works: This versatile program for IBM-compatiblemachines displays a menu whenever you turn on your computer.The menu lists all of the programs on your hard-disk driveand lets you run them with a single keystroke, withoutforcing you to remember file names and locations. When you'redone with a program, you bounce back to the Menu Works menu,ready to launch another or perform such tasks as locating orcopying files. Menu Works is easy to install, and it willeven scan your disk and build a menu for you. The manual isbrief and clear on how to alter menus. (PC Dynamics, $14.95.)                                                                                                          XTreeGold: This program presents the entire contents ofyour IBM-compatible machine's hard disk and floppy disks inclear diagrams and lists, and then makes it easy to copy,delete, move, rename or launch programs. The program is easyto install and customize. It allows you to view documents,including pictures, created by other programs. It presentscommands clearly on the screen. (XTree, $92.)                                                                                                          Stacker: A software program that compresses all the fileson your IBM-compatible PC's hard disk. The result is toeffectively expand the size of your hard disk by as much as100%. The process is complex, but you don't have tounderstand it. The installation program guides you step bystep. (Stac Electronics, $99.)                                                                                                          Adobe Type Manager: A small program that permits aMacintosh or IBM-compatible PC running Windows to producehandsome fonts made for costly, industry-standard Postscriptprinters even on less expensive printers that lack Adobe'sproprietary Postscript circuitry. It operates &quot;in thebackground,&quot; meaning you don't have to enter repeatedinstructions to get it to work. (Adobe Systems, $59.)                                                                                                          Access PC: Another program that works in the background ona Macintosh. This one automatically permits the current lineof Macs to read and write files directly from and to 31/2-inch disks formatted on IBM-compatible PCs, greatlysimplifying the exchange of data between the two kinds ofmachines. All you do is put the Access PC file into a specialdirectory, or folder, on your hard disk, and youautomatically gain the ability to use -- and even to format-- IBM-compatible disks. (Insignia Solutions, $62.)                                                                                                          Super Boomerang: This one lets Mac users leap quickly totheir most-used folders, or directories, and summon theirmost-used files from any program's standard &quot;open&quot; or &quot;save&quot;command. The program remembers your frequently used files andfolders. It's bundled as part of a package called NowUtilities. (Now Software, $89.)</TEXT></DOC>
