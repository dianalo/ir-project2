Companies as diverse as General Motors Corp., ITT Corp.'sSheraton unit and construction giant Fluor Corp. say theywill consider new investments in South Africa once thepresident lifts sanctions against the country's apartheidgovernment. Digital Equipment Corp. sent a team of seniormanagers to South Africa last month for the first time since1972 to explore investments.</LP><TEXT>   H.J. Heinz Co. Chairman Anthony J.F. O'Reilly visitedSouth Africa in February to meet with President F.W. de Klerkand African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela todiscuss investment possibilities. The removal of sanctions&quot;will certainly put South Africa back on our radar screen,&quot; aHeinz official said. The Pittsburgh-based food company isalready in Zimbabwe and Botswana and, like others, sees inSouth Africa a chance to increase its overseas market share.   Still, companies seem more likely to tiptoe than stampedeback to South Africa. And some, including Mobil Corp.,International Business Machines Corp., Ford Motor Co. andXerox Corp, say Mr. Bush's decision won't alter theirno-investment policies. These companies say investment inSouth Africa could be too expensive and politically riskyeven when sanctions are lifted.   Foes of South Africa's apartheid government note thatdespite President Bush's move, 28 states and 92 cities,including New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, have sanctionsor &quot;selective purchasing policies&quot; that prohibit doingbusiness in South Africa. In addition, big institutionalshareholders such as the California Public EmployeesRetirement System and the New York City Employee RetirementSystem have vowed to distance themselves from companiesdealing with South Africa. Many universities have takensimilar positions on investing their endowment funds.   &quot;Companies will have a tough time saying we're listeningto George Bush but not to Nelson Mandela,&quot; says RichardKnight, research associate with Africa Fund, a New Yorkanti-apartheid group. Nevertheless, he said he is &quot;veryconcerned&quot; about fresh investment in South Africa.   If U.S. businesses do return to South Africa they willlikely enter into distribution and technology agreements,rather than investing in new manufacturing plants. &quot;Not toomany corporations want to be the first to go in prematurely,&quot;said Timothy Smith, executive director of the InterfaithCenter on Corporate Responsibility. He noted that majorAmerican banks still have corporate policies against loansfor investment in South Africa.   Even if companies feel they can handle the heat at home,they may have lost their competitive edge to those who neverleft. Mobil, for example, said a return to South Africa wouldbe &quot;astronomically expensive.&quot; It's unlikely the oil companycould buy back at a reasonable price the operations it soldto General Mining Union Corp. in 1989, and trying to buildits market share back to 20% from zero wouldn't be anycheaper.   And activists, though weakened, continue to houndcorporate management. Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. and ExxonCorp. both had to fend off shareholder proposals demandingthat they sever their remaining ties to South Africa, eventhough Exxon divested its operations in 1986 and Goodyearsold its business in 1989. Neither plans to return.   Other companies, though, such as Fluor, an Irvine, Calif.,engineering and construction concern, would find returningeasier. Fluor left itself a repurchase option when it soldits South African operations to an independent trust in 1986.&quot;This is one step toward making {the repurchase} apossibility,&quot; a spokeswoman said. But she said the companywould likely wait for a calmer social and political order toemerge in South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
