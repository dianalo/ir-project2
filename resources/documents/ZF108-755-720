(PSI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dynamo ResourcesLtd., delivered its first Superscreen this month to the Canadian military,says PSI chief of technology Charles Haynes.andP;  Haynes, who invented thedevice, adds that production will be in full swing by the end of the year.andM;Superscreen is a flat electronic worksurface measuring up to 60 inchesdiagonally.andP;  It can display 70,000 characters at once, which is 35 times morethan a typical cathode ray screen.andM;&quot;The screen is large enough,&quot; says Haynes, &quot;that you can view two full-sizenewspaper pages or 15 8.5- by 11-inch pages at the same time.andP;  By comparison,if you can see one full page with your Apple, that's really good.andM;&quot;With Superscreen, desktop publishing will be elevated to an incrediblelevel,&quot; he predicts.andM;Another promising application is in computer-aided design (CAD).andP;  Forinteractive work, the screen includes a digitizing pen that can be usedeither to select menu options or create files.andP;  Users can write, scribble orsketch directly on the plasma surface; the computer stores the informationand immediately displays it.andM;&quot;It's very natural to use,&quot; he argues.andP;  &quot;A lot more natural than standardperipheral devices such as menu boards, mice and digitizing pads.&quot;andM;Architects, engineers and other CAD users will also appreciate the factSuperscreen can be tilted to any angle -- like a drafting table, he says.andO;Moreover, a &quot;see-through&quot; display permits the screen's use as a clear plasticoverlay on top of a light table.andM;Besides CAD, Haynes foresees Superscreen's eventual use in police and firedispatching.andP;  Perhaps the wildest idea is to use Superscreen as an electronicdesk, says Haynes.andP;  &quot;We can easily make a display that's both the size andshape of a desktop.andP;  When you get to work, you could flip on the power and upwould come an electronic calendar, a note pad, your messages and a businesscard index.&quot;andM;Staring at such a device all day long would be easier on the user thanstaring at a conventional computer screen, adds Haynes.andM;Moreover, &quot;because there are no cathode rays passing through the screen andhitting you, there are therefore no health concerns,&quot; he comments.andM;Superscreen comes with a proprietary interface called the Plasma Card and iscompatible with IBM systems.andP;  Users can run any software on the plasma screenand can display both regular TV and HDTV.andM;The electronic worksurface will initially be priced at around $25,000,estimates Haynes.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
