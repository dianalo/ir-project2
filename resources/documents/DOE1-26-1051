The impact of transient outages has a significantimpact on the reliability levels of individual consumers being servicedby a utility network. In this paper, a practical approach using a flowgraph technique to trace, identify and simulate the operational pathsof a network configuration is presented to evaluate the frequency andduration of interruptions at various consumer locations including theconsideration of maintenance activities and transient outages of componentsunder normal and adverse weather conditions (e.g., many reliability techniquespresented in the literature neglect the effect of transient disturbancesand the environmental and weather effects on component reliability levels).The proposed model is applied to the standard IEEE 14 bus test networkwhere particular &quot;critical&quot; locations are selected and sets of operationalpaths identified and reliability indices evaluated.</TEXT></DOC>
