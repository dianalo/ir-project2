The management board member's resignation followed Friday's announcement of a shake-up in the upper levels of VW's finance division, which included the ouster of the company's foreign-exchange manager, who had previously been on vacation status. And it came as West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the foreign-exchange scandal might delay the government's plans to sell its 20% stake in VW to the public this year.    Mr. Selowsky, the chief financial officer, had been scheduled to step down when his contract expired April 30. His decision to resign early was meant to claim managerial responsibility for allowing the manipulation of VW's huge dollar positions to take place, a VW spokesman said. However, there weren't any indications from the company or investigators that the 56-year-old Mr. Selowsky was actually involved in the foreign-exchange manipulation.    The Wolfsburg-based auto maker last week alerted state attorneys to its discovery of &quot;criminal manipulation&quot; in its huge foreign-exchange positions that involved the erasure of computer data and tampering with computer programs in 1984. Public prosecutors have said they are trying to establish a link with persons or institutions outside VW.    Investigators are &quot;questioning just about anybody who could conceivably have had anything to do with the case,&quot; said a spokesman for the state attorney's office in Braunschweig, which has jurisdiction for Wolfsburg.    Local prosecutors have been joined in the investigation by the Federal Crime Bureau, West Germany's federal law-enforcement agency. And Frankfurt state attorneys are looking for possible links to West Germany's banking center.    The suspected conspiracy left VW completely exposed to the huge-foreign exchange loss in the dollar market, apparently after the culprits forged forward contracts. The dollar was strong in 1984, and the people involved in the fraud apparently expected the currency to continue to rise. Instead, they were caught short when the dollar peaked and began a steady decline.    The reorganization of the finance division, announced Friday, included the summary dismissal of VW's foreign-exchange manager, Burkhard Junger. Additionally, two senior executives were suspended, and four junior traders in the foreign-exchange operation were &quot;placed on vacation.&quot;    Guenther Borchert, head of VW's finance and payments division, was relieved of duties until further notice. The 57-year-old Mr. Borchert reported to Mr. Selowsky. Also suspended was Siegfried Mueller, the 56-year-old head of the department for money and foreign-exchange clearing. The senior executives were suspended for management failure.    Mr. Junger, the foreign-exchange manager, had already given notice in January to leave VW over &quot;differences&quot; on how the foreign-exchange operations should be run. VW had put the 39-year-old department head on vacation status to allow him to look for another job, a common severance practice for West German managers. His employment at VW would have officially ended in September, or with the start of a new job. Mr. Junger has been seeking a position in the foreign-exchange department of Bankers Trust New York Corp. in Frankfurt.    VW wouldn't explain the reasons for the summary dismissal that ended its arrangement with Mr. Junger. But the end of the severance pay amounts to a breach of West Germany's rigid labor laws that a company can defend only with a serious grievance against an employee.    Mr. Junger, who couldn't be reached for comment, was quoted in today's edition of Der Spiegel magazine as denying any wrongdoing. He reportedly has agreed to cooperate with the state attorneys and criminal bureau in their investigation.    The magazine said VW's suspicion of criminal action solidified on Feb. 18, when the National Bank of Hungary declined to recognize a dollar futures contract that VW's records showed it had. The Hungarian bank claimed to have no record of the transaction in its own books and wouldn't cover VW's dollar position, according to the magazine account.    Meanwhile, the official probe into VW's charges has hurt the company's share price and the prospects for the government's sale of its VW stake.    After VW's initial announcement early last week, the stock price plunged 9.2% before recovering a few points later in the week. The $259 million loss nearly equals VW's last reported net group earnings of $322 million in 1985.    The government has hoped to sell its VW shares this year as part of its denationalization plans. But &quot;we now have to ask ourselves whether we can still hold on to that scheduling,&quot; Mr. Stoltenberg, the finance minister, said in a newspaper interview. He questioned the competence of some VW managers, but said he didn't hold VW's supervisory and managing boards responsible. The alleged fraud was an act of &quot;reprehensible criminal behavior&quot; occurring below the managing-board level, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
