But have you heardabout the guy who stands to turn a $75 investment into $7.5million or more?   V. Gordon Clemons, chairman and chief executive officer ofnewly public Fortis Corp., has that chance over the next fewyears. Fortis helps employers control their workers'compensation and other health care costs.</LP><TEXT>   It all depends, of course, on whether Mr. Clemons runs theIrvine, Calif., company well enough to sustain the$10-a-share price at which Fortis was offered to the publicon June 28. If the stock falls, some of his potential profitvanishes. And whatever he makes is subject to California andfederal taxes that will likely slice 40% off the top.   But even in this year's hot market for initial publicofferings, and the overnight millionaires that come with it,Mr. Clemons's options stand out. He paid only one-hundredthcent for options on each of 750,000 shares. Immediately afterthe Fortis offering, he agreed to exercise options for150,000 shares, now worth $1.5 million at Friday's closingprice of 10. Mr. Clemons also agreed not to sell those sharesfor a year.   Of the remaining options on 600,000 shares, he is now freeto exercise options on 417,000; he can exercise options on123,000 more shares on Jan. 1, 1992, and on the remaining60,000 shares on Jan. 1, 1993. If he exercises all theseoptions and holds the shares, he would control about 15.6% ofthe company's outstanding common stock. Mr. Clemons, whodoesn't own any other stock, also is paid an annual salary of$239,800.   Because of securities regulations prohibiting companiesfrom promoting their shares immediately after an offering,47-year-old Mr. Clemons declined to comment on any of thesematters.   Mr. Clemons, a 16-year veteran of the health-care andinsurance industries, came to Fortis from Caremark Inc.,where he was president when Baxter International Inc. boughtthe home therapy company in 1987. Previously, he had beenpresident of Intracorp, a subsidiary of Cigna Corp. and thelargest provider of ways to control workers' compensationcosts.   As do the executives of many entrepreneurial companies,Mr. Clemons entered into a non-qualified stock optionagreement with Fortis and North Star Universal Inc. when hesigned up with them in 1988. Such agreements are designed togive executives incentives to build their enterprises intoprofitable companies by giving them options to buy shares atlow prices, which they can later sell at market value.   Until last month, Fortis was a wholly owned subsidiary ofNorth Star Universal, a small Minneapolis conglomerate whosediverse interests include stakes in Michael Foods Inc., andAmericable, a distributor of computer cabling and relatedproducts.   Fortis, formed by North Star four years ago to operatevocational rehabilitation centers, moved into managingworkers' compensation claims in 1989 by acquiring VPS CaseManagement Inc. of Virginia. The company now has 735employees in 70 offices across the country, who provideinsurers and other clients with computerized auditing ofmedical fees, case management of workers' compensationclaims, physical examinations and vocational rehabilitation.   Fortis's revenue has climbed steadily, to nearly $28.9million in fiscal 1991 ended in March from nearly $5.8million in 1987. But costs and expenses also have risen withthe company's growth and acquisitions. Fortis, profitable in1987 and 1988, reported losses in 1989 and 1990 before againturning a profit in 1991 of $685,000.   North Star, under pressure by state regulators to reducedebt, offered 1.5 million of its Fortis shares to the publicat $10 a share, and kept a 49% stake in the company. Fortisredeemed $9.9 million in outstanding Series A preferred stockissued to the parent company, leaving $5.1 million from theoffering for working capital and other expenses.   By exercising options for 150,000 shares after theoffering, Mr. Clemons is helping inject capital into Fortisthrough tax payments. During the next year, he will payfederal and state taxes of about $600,000, or 40% of his $1.5million in paper profit; the company benefits becauseexercised options become part of its compensation costs,reducing taxable profits.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Over-the-counter stocks inched lower in the slowesttrading since Christmas Eve, as many investors extended theirFourth of July holiday.
