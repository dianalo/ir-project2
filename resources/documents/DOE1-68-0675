<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-68-0675 </DOCNO><TEXT>The US Dept. of Energy (DOE), Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC),set out, some years ago, to identify design features which would enablea fixed-bed gasifier to operate on the full range of US coals. In addition,an advanced concept for product gas stream treatment was originated anddemonstration of its viability was the major objective of this work.Some further modifications of the gasifier were also validated. Thishas resulted in an integrated test facility focused on the METC stirredfixed-bed gasifier with both air- and oxygen-blowing capabilities. Thesystem includes a novel dry tar full-flow gas cleanup system that sequentiallyremoves dust, and elemental sulfur in separate manageable effluent streams,thus enhancing further stream treatment, disposal, or recycling usage.Also, water-soluble elements, sodium and potassium in particular, arereduced to trace levels. Sulfur removal is accomplished through a first-of-its-kindpressurized Holmes-Stretford desulfurizer plant that converts the hydrogensulfide in the gas stream to an elemental sulfur cake while operatingdirectly on the fuel gas. Product gas can be extracted after any stageof cleaning to satisfy a variety of end users. The system has been successfullydemonstrated on a broad spectrum of US coals from western subbituminousthrough the highly caking eastern bituminous variety. Although this reportprimarily emphasizes air-blown gasification, oxygen-blown tests werealso conducted to enhance and broaden the acquired data base. Completegasification and gas stream cleanup details and data relevant to processingPittsburgh seam coals at pressures up to 240 psig are presented herein.</TEXT></DOC>
