Microsoft-compatible mouse; Hercules or EGAgraphics card; hard disk; DOS 3.1, 3.2, or 3.3.andM;In Short: An easy-to-use, graphics-based package that builds standaloneapplications in C from flowcharts you define.andP;  Not copy protected.andM;HANDS ON Forget everything you've heard about computer-aided softwareengineering (CASE) tools.andP;  Syscorp International's MicroSTEP applicationgenerator brings substance to a field typically characterized by hype andempty promises.andM;MicroSTEP lets you build complex applications without writing a single lineof code.andP;  Instead, you design the application by building a flow chart.andP;  Onceyou're through, MicroSTEP automatically generates and compiles thecorresponding C code and links it to produce a standalone .EXE applicationprogram.andM;Developing an application using MicroSTEP is a surprisingly simple process.andO;The graphical user interface provides a collection of icons along the leftborder of the screen.andP;  Some icons represent a major system component, such asa database, printed report, input screen, or disk file.andP;  Others define howdata is processed or transferred from one system component to another.andM;To specify system components, you simply click on the appropriate icon andplace it on a screen.andP;  Once the system components are placed, you build thespecific data structures.andP;  A click of the mouse button creates a field, and adialog box prompts you for information such as name and data type.andM;Using this approach, describing how data is processed becomes trivial.andP;  Forexample, the process &quot;Using the customer name, check the database for thecustomer; if found, retrieve the customer's mailing address and loan balance&quot;is expressed as a line drawn from the database fields to the correspondingscreen fields.andP;  To express the idea of retrieving all customers who owe morethan their credit line, you click on the DEBT field in the CUSTOMER record,type andgt;, and click on the CREDITLIMIT field.andP;  A dozen clicks of the mouse cancreate a process it would take me a dozen pages to explain.andM;There's no need for a separate screen or report builder.andP;  Both are builtright into the development environment and are simple to use.andP;  To display acustomer's phone number on the screen, for example, you bring the data recordinto the reference window, click on the phone number field, then click on thescreen template shown in the active window.andP;  A picture specification appearsand can be moved at will.andM;When the application specification is complete, MicroSTEP will actually writethe code based on your graphic specification.andP;  First, the program examinesthe entire specification for consistency and completeness.andP;  Anything you mayhave overlooked, such as a data field definition, is pointed out so that youcan correct it.andM;MicroSTEP then reads your specification and generates C code.andP;  The programallows you to examine the C code if you want to, but you don't have to dealwith the source code at all.andP;  MicroSTEP automatically compiles and links thesource code to produce a standalone .EXE program.andP;  All of the libraryroutines needed are linked into the file, and there is no license fee.andM;You can build applications without having to know specifics about filenames,data tables, or hardware on the target system.andP;  A comprehensive installationprogram handles these options and lets you customize screen colors anddefault key assignments.andM;The MicroSTEP package includes a comprehensive hands-on tutorial that guidesyou through the creation of a typical point-of-sale database application.andO;The tutorial is geared for experienced programmers, but it should beunderstandable to anyone with some programming or database design experience.andM;It took me about 4 hours to perform the tutorial from start to finish.andO;Generating an executable program from the specification took about 25 minutesmore.andP;  The result was a 610K .EXE file and an application that looked andperformed exactly as I expected.andP;  Producing the same application usingconventional programming would have taken at least ten times as long.andM;All this capability comes at a price--and I don't mean the $5,000 price tag.andO;MicroSTEP is a memory hog.andP;  Written in C, it requires that your PC have 565Kof RAM available to load and run programs.andP;  For me, that means booting up mycomputer without any memory-resident programs, RAMdisks, or disk caches.andP;  Italso means that it won't run under DOS 4.0.andP;  The six 1.2MB program floppydisks occupy about 6MB of disk space and, since MicroSTEP is a graphics-basedprogram, it requires that the development machine be equipped with either aHercules or EGA graphics card and a mouse.andP;  The generated applications aretext based, so no special equipment is needed to run them.andM;Unfortunately, the applications produced by MicroSTEP are strictly for singleusers and cannot be used in a shared-file network system.andP;  Syscorp expects toship a version that produces network-compatible applications this summer.andM;MicroSTEP is a powerful application-development environment that allowsexperienced systems programmers and business analysts to be more efficientand productive than ever.andP;  The increase in productivity makes the packagewell worth its hefty price.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
