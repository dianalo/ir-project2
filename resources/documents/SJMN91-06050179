On the Continent,&quot; a guide to Europe for British travelers that hepublished in London. The joy of travel, he wrote, should not be derived solelyfrom seeing &quot;the sights&quot; but from mingling with &quot;peoples whose customs, habitsand general outlook are different from your own.&quot;;     Between &quot;On theContinent&quot; and Mr. Fodor's retirement a decade ago, the number of Fodor guidesgrew to more than 140 titles, many in languages other than English.
