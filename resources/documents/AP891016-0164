One officer and one civilian died in the attacks Sunday andearly Monday, the spokesman said.   The rebels, known as Contras, rejected the charges and accusedgovernment troops of attacking them.   Contras attacked a registration station in El Naranjo, 93 milesnorth of Managua, said the spokesman, who refused to be identified,saying the Defense Ministry was preparing a formal communique.   Electoral officials and peasants lining up to register at the ElNaranjo station threw themselves to the ground when the Contrasbegan firing, the spokesman said. Soldiers returned fire, but nocasualties were reported.   Sunday was the third of four Sundays on which Nicaragua'sestimated 1.9 million eligible voters could register for Feb. 25general elections. The last registration day is Sunday.   Early Monday the Contras ambushed an army jeep and killed alieutenant and a civilian woman as they traveled near Lovago, 89miles east of Managua, the spokesman said. Another officer andcivilian were wounded in the attack.   In a Sunday night attack, the spokesman said, Contras attackedtwo army trucks transporting soldiers near San Pedro Lovago, 120miles east of Managua. One government soldier was wounded, he said.   The spokesman said the Contras on Sunday also attacked an armypost near Yolaina, 200 miles southeast of Managua, but nocasualties were reported.   Enrique Bermudez, top military leader of the rebel NicaraguanResistance, on Monday denied ``any offensive action by our troops.''   ``What is happening is that the Sandinista army is conducting acleanup and persecution operation against out forces, who mustdefend themselves,'' Bermudez told The Associated Press in atelephone interview from Tegucigalpa, capital of neighboringHonduras.   Congress last April approved $49 million in non-lethal aid tothe Contras, most of whom are now camped in Honduran jungle campsnear the Nicaraguan border. Lethal aid was halted in 1988 and thenon-lethal aid bill includes a clause calling for an end to aid ifthe Contras stage attacks.   ``They attack and persecute us while accusing us of attackingthem,'' Bermudez told the AP. ``This is just to fatten up a fileagainst us, which U.S. congressmen will present during thediscussion next November'' on whether to maintain non-lethal aid.   Sandinista and Contra leaders agreed to a truce in March 1988, amonth after Congress refused to continue military aid to the rebels.   President Daniel Ortega, who is seeking re-election, calledearly elections as part of regional peace accords that call fordemobilizing the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
