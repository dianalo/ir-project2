How about more talkshows that trot out the latest celebrities, or yet anotherretread of a 1950s game show?   That's what syndicators are wondering as they head to NewOrleans for next week's 29th annual convention of theNational Association of Television Programming Executives,where shows are sold to individual stations.</LP><TEXT>   Daunted by the success of returning programs, syndicatorshave cut back sharply on the number of new shows they willtry to get on the air. The market used to roll out newprograms at a dizzying pace, producing many expensive flops.But at this year's convention, only nine new programs frommajor producers will be on the block, less than half the cropin 1989.   Most stations with marginal shows appear to be unwillingto gamble on unknown programs that could send their ratingseven lower. &quot;The syndication business is dismal,&quot; says Carl{Bud} Carey, president of Times Mirror Co.'s broadcastingdivision, which owns four stations. &quot;There are few timeperiods for new product, and there are slim pickings amongthe new shows.&quot;   In fact, there is such a paucity that WCBS in New York isreplacing a struggling syndicated show, &quot;Candid Camera,&quot; witha half-hour local newscast in the 4 p.m. slot. &quot;There isn't alot out there, and development for 1992-93 doesn't lookgood,&quot; says Roger Colloff, general manager of the CBS Inc.station. &quot;It's a business of feast or famine, and there arefew feasting.&quot;   This year's limited selection is good news for incumbentshows, especially a few weaker ones -- like Geraldo Rivera's&quot;Now It Can Be Told&quot; news magazine and &quot;Jenny Jones,&quot; adaytime talk show -- that would have been cancellationcandidates.   It could also produce a scramble by stations to renewestablished entries, resulting in higher fees for suchsuccessful sellers as King World Productions Inc. (&quot;Wheel ofFortune,&quot; &quot;Jeopardy]&quot; and the Oprah Winfrey talk show) andParamount Communications Inc.'s television subsidiary(&quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: The NextGeneration&quot;).   The newcomer with the highest profile: &quot;You Bet YourLife,&quot; a new version of the highly successful quiz show thatpremiered in 1950, ran for 11 years and starred Groucho Marx.The revival features Bill Cosby, who may fare better thancomedian Buddy Hackett, who hosted a short-lived revival ofthe show in 1980.   &quot;You Bet Your Life,&quot; which will usually air in one of thetwo half-hour slots that lead into the start of prime time at8 p.m., has already been sold to 82 stations, says BobJacobs, president of the distribution division ofCarsey-Werner Co., which also produces &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; onNBC.   The biggest turf battle, however, is for the late-nightaudience. NBC's Johnny Carson, who has dominated that timeslot for years, is set to retire May 22. He will be succeededat &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; by Jay Leno, but changing a longtimehost often leads viewers to explore alternatives.   Furthermore, in October ABC canceled &quot;Into the Night,&quot; itsfifth failed attempt to find a follow-up for &quot;Nightline,&quot;which ends at midnight. That created even more buyers forsyndicators. And CBS affiliates often delay the network's11:30 p.m. hodgepodge of cheaply produced crime shows by halfan hour, opening up still more late time slots.   Among those who hope to draw late-night viewers from&quot;Tonight&quot; and the &quot;Arsenio Hall Show&quot;: Actress WhoopiGoldberg; snide comedian Dennis Miller; radio's popularbare-knuckle conservative, Rush Limbaugh; and formerPhiladelphia talk show host Jane Whitney. And King World isconsidering letting stations run a second play of Oprah'sdaytime show in the late-night slot.   &quot;With all the changes taking place in late night, we feelthe opportunity for someone new to come into the franchise isthere,&quot; says Phil Oldham, executive vice president of GenesisEntertainment, which is producing the Whoopi Goldberg series.Genesis, owned by Gannaway Enterprises Inc., has committed$13 million to the show. Ms. Goldberg will also be theexecutive producer of the half-hour nightly series, whichwill consist of a single celebrity interview each night.   The most unlikely late-night effort comes from thebombastic Mr. Limbaugh, who is being syndicated by MultimediaInc.'s entertainment division. His show will offer no guests,no sidekick, no band and an abundance of the politicallyincorrect. In his daily diatribe on the radio, theanti-abortion conservative used to play a vacuum cleaner whenhe mentioned abortion, and he regularly calls feminists&quot;femi-Nazis.&quot; He never mentions Gov. Michael Dukakis by name-- he is simply &quot;The Loser.&quot;   Warner Bros. is set to roll out &quot;Night Talk&quot; in March withMs. Whitney. &quot;There's an entire demographic of working womenwho are being ignored out there late at night, which isdominated by male hosts,&quot; says Scott Carlin, a senior vicepresident at the Time Warner Inc. television unit.   By day, the dial is so crowded with jawboning that onlytwo series will try to join the current cast. Vicki Lawrence,the former sidekick of Carol Burnett, star of &quot;Mama's Family&quot;and host of &quot;Win, Lose or Draw,&quot; will have a one-hour dailyprogram. Kitty Kelley, author of best-selling biographies ofNancy Reagan and Frank Sinatra, will host another, featuringcelebrity interviews.   Two new game shows, &quot;How's Your Love Life?&quot; and &quot;That'sAmore,&quot; will try to tap into the trend of inquiring aboutdating and the bedroom, a format pioneered by &quot;LoveConnection&quot; and taken leaps further -- in terms ofquestionable taste, at least -- by &quot;Studs&quot; from News Corp.'sFox Television subsidiary.   In &quot;That's Amore,&quot; produced by Westinghouse ElectricCorp.'s Group W Productions, married couples air theirdifferences. Each person brings along someone to defend himor her, like a mother or a friend. The show is a direct stealfrom a show airing in Italy and, in fact, uses the same host,Luca Barbareschi.   &quot;You can laugh at this because these marriages aren't introuble,&quot; says Dirk Zimmerman, president of Group WProductions. &quot;These are people who are really trying to workout their problems.&quot;   &quot;How's Your Love Life?&quot; from Viacom Inc. &quot;takes advantageof the present morals,&quot; meaning loosened standards onpremarital sex, says Henry Schleiff, chairman of Viacom'sbroadcast and entertainment units.   Contestants ask a three-member celebrity panel for adviceon love. In the pilot, a college student, dating a woman 13years older than he is, seeks counsel from John Davidson, adimpled middle-aged crooner and onetime host of &quot;That'sIncredible.&quot; The student wants to know whether he shouldcontinue to live with Mom and Dad or move in with hisgirlfriend. In the end, he decides to take the plunge.</TEXT></DOC>
