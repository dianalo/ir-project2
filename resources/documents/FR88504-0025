The FMP was prepared by the Pacific Fishery ManagementCouncil (Council) and approved and implemented by the Secretary of Commerceas provided by the Magnuson Act. Regulations at 50 CFR Part 661 providethe mechanism for making preseason and in-season adjustments to managementmeasures, within limits set by the FMP, by notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.The majority of 1987 management measures (52 FR 17264, May 6, 1987), whichwere implemented under the framework FMP, remain in effect until modified,superseded, or rescinded by the 1988 management measures.This emergency interim rule implements management measures for 1988 oceansalmon fisheries which were recommended and adopted by the Council at itsApril 4-8 meeting. Most management measures in this rule comport with theframework regulations implementing the FMP. Deviations from the frameworkand implementing regulations, recommended by the Council and requiringimplementation through use of the emergency rulemaking authority of section305(e) of the Magnuson Act, are also included. This emergency interim rulewill remain in effect for 90 days and may be extended for a second 90-dayperiod.<ITAG tagnum="84">Schedule Used to Establish 1988 Management Measures</ITAG>The annual regulatory process concerning the Council's formulation andadoption of season management measures and their promulgation as Federalrules is established by framework regulations implementing the FMP. Inaccordance with the season setting procedures of the FMP, the Council'sSalmon Technical Team (STT) and staff economist prepared several reportsfor the Council, its advisors, and the public. The first report, ``Reviewof 1987 Ocean Salmon Fisheries,'' summarizes the 1987 ocean salmon fisheriesand assesses how well the Council's management objectives were met in 1987.The second report, ``Preseason Report I: Stock Abundance Analysis for 1988Ocean Salmon Fisheries,'' provides the 1988 salmon stock status projectionsand analyzes the impacts on the stocks and Council management goals under1987 regulations or regulatory procedures.The Council met on March 8-11, 1988, in Seattle, Washington, to developproposed management options for 1988. Four commercial and recreationalfishery management options were proposed for further analysis and publiccomment. These options presented various combinations of management measuresdesigned to protect weak stocks and provide for ocean harvests of moreabundant stocks of coho and chinook salmon. After the March Council meeting,the STT and staff economist prepared a third report, ``Preseason ReportII: Analysis of Proposed Regulatory Options for 1988 Ocean Salmon Fisheries,''which analyzes the effects of the proposed 1988 management options. Thisreport also was distributed to the Council, its advisors, and the public.Public hearings on the proposed options were held from March 29 to April4, 1988, in Seattle, Washington, Coos Bay and Astoria, Oregon, and Millbraeand Eureka, California.The Council met on April 5-8, 1988, in Millbrae, to adopt its final 1988recommendations. Following the April Council meeting, the STT and staffeconomist prepared a fourth report, ``Preseason Report III: 1988 OceanSalmon Fisheries, Analysis of Impacts of Council Adopted 1988 Regulations,''which analyzes the environmental and socio-economic effects of the Council'sfinal recommendations. This report includes an environmental assessmentand a coastal zone consistency determination, and was distributed to theCouncil, its advisors, and the public.<ITAG tagnum="84">Resource Status</ITAG>Some salmon runs returning to Washington, Oregon, and California streamsin 1988 are expected to be larger than in recent years. They include apredicted return of 450,700 upper Columbia River bright fall chinook adultsdestined for areas above Bonneville Dam, the largest run in recent history,and the predicted abundance of Oregon Production Index (OPI) coho salmondestined for coastal and Columbia River public hatcheries south of LeadbetterPoint, Washington, which at 1,590,600 fish is 281 percent of the 1987 predictionof 565,400 fish.Primary resource concerns are for Klamath River fall, and Columbia Riverspring and summer chinook salmon, and some Washington coastal and PugetSound natural coho salamon. Management of all these stocks is impactedby interjurisdictional agreements among Tribal, State, Federal, and/orCanadian managers.<ITAG tagnum="84">Chinook Salmon Stocks</ITAG>Abundance of California Central Valley chinook stocks is expected to beless than that of recent years (1988: 707,100 chinook; 1987: 812,600 chinook).However, Sacramento River fall-run chinook, which comprise the majorityof Central Valley salmon, are healthy. Spawning escapement for Sacramentofall chinook is predicted to be above the 122,000-180,000 goal range in1988.Escapements of upper Sacramento winter-run chinook have dwindled from over100,000 fish in the late 1960s to above 2,000 adult fish in recent years.This depressed run is only slightly impacted by ocean fisheries as theycurrently are configured, and that impact is primarily on two-year-oldfish in the recreational fishery. This run was considered by NMFS for listingas threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C.1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>, in 1987. At that time, NMFS determined that its proposedlisting as endangered or threatened was not warranted because State andFederal fishery management agencies were addressing the habitat problemsthat contributed to its decline (52 FR 6041, February 27, 1987).Klamath River fall chinook salmon is the primary management concern inthe area from Oxford Reef Red Buoy off southern Oregon to Horse Mountainoff northern California, the so-called ``Klamath River management zone.''The estimated total ocean population of Klamath River fall chinook in 1988is 334,500 fish, considerably lower than the 1987 postseason abundanceestimate of 615,600 fish. Ocean escapement to the Klamath River in 1987totaled 199,000 adult fish, over twice the framework FMP ocean escapementgoal of 82,700 adult fall chinook. The projected ocean escapement to theKlamath River in 1988 is about 132,000 fish.Oregon coastal chinook stocks are expected to be above average in abundancein 1988. The south-migrating and localized components of these stocks areimportant contributors to ocean fisheries off Oregon and northern California,while the north-migrating component primarily contributes to ocean fisheriesoff British Columbia and Alaska. It is expected that the aggregate Oregoncoastal chinook escapement goal of 150,000 to 200,000 naturally spawningadults will continue to be met or exceeded.Estimates of Columbia River chinook abundance vary by stock as follows:(1) Numbers of upriver spring chinook predicted to return to the riverin 1988 (75,200 fish) are below the 1987 return (99,800 fish), but nearly33 percent greater than the 1979-84 average (56,600 fish). The 1988 stockstatus is extremely depressed, and ocean escapement will be substantiallybelow the goal of 100,000 to 120,000 adults counted at Bonneville Dam.Upriver spring chinook are affected only slightly by ocean harvests offWashington and Oregon.(2) The expectation for ocean escapement of upper Columbia River summerchinook salmon in 1988 is about 33,000 fish, the same as in 1987. In-riverabundance of upper Columbia River summer chinook, which are primarily ofnatural spawning origin, steadily declined over the period 1979-1983. Althoughthe 1987 in-river run size was the largest since 1978, the stock's statusremains extremely depressed, with ocean escapement levels being about 59percent below the goal of 80,000 to 90,000 adults counted at BonnevilleDam.(3) Lower river spring chinook (Willamette) returns are expected to bebetter than in 1987 (1988: 97,000 fish; 1987: 93,800 fish). (4) The upriver bright fall chinook run is in excellent condition, withabout 446,500 fish forecasted to return to the river. The in-river returnof this stock in 1987, 421,000 fish, also was excellent, the largest since1971. The escapement goal for upriver bright chinook is 40,000 fish aboveMcNary Dam. (5) Spring Creek hatchery fall chinook abundance continues to be a concern.The projection for a return to the Columbia River of only 5,900 SpringCreek hatchery fall chinook in 1988 is a record low. (6) Lower river hatchery fall chinook stocks are healthy, with ocean escapementforecasted at 246,500 adults, more than twice the average level for the1981-1985 period (107,700 fish). Over 42,000 lower river wild fall chinookare predicted to return to the river in 1988, compared with 37,000 fishin 1987. Washington coastal and Puget Sound chinook generally migrate to the farnorth and are affected insignificantly be ocean harvests south of the U.S.-Canadaborder. <ITAG tagnum="84">Coho Salmon Stocks </ITAG>The Oregon Production Index (OPI) is an annual index of coho abundancefrom Leadbetter, Point, Washington, south through California. Oregon coastaland Columbia River coho stocks are the primary components of the OPI. In1988, the Council approved methodologies for predicting OPI area coho salmonstock abundance which partitioned coho stocks into three groups: privatehatchery, public hatchery, and Oregon coastal natural. Prediction methodologiesfor each group are described below: <T3>Private Hatchery.</T3> Private hatchery coho adults were predictedby multiplying the number of smolts released in 1987 by the estimated survivalrate of these smolts. Smolts were grouped by stock type based on expecteddifferences in ocean catch distribution and contribution to the fishery.Survival estimates were scaled from the previous year survival rate basedon (1) the ratio of change in OPI public hatchery jack returns adjustedfor smolt releases, and (2) the ratio of change in ocean upwelling duringthe period smolts were released. <T3>Public Hatchery.</T3> The OPI area public hatchery stocks include fishfrom all public hatcheries on the Columbia River, the Oregon coast, andthe Klamath River. Data years used were adult years 1971 to 1987, exceptfor 1983. Adult abundance was predicted in a multiple linear regressionwith three independent variables: (1) Previous year jack counts in th ColumbiaRiver, corrected for overestimates due to small adults in recent years,(2) previous year jack counts from the Oregon coast and the Klamath River,again corrected for small adults, and (3) previous year Columbia Riverjack counts times the proportion of smolts released in the Columbia River,which were released after May 19. This adjusts for the reduced maturation rate and increased survival rateobserved for these smolt releases. <T3>Oregon Coastal Natural (OCN) Coho Salmon.</T3> Predicted OCN stockscomprise lake and river stocks. Lake stocks (less than five percent ofthe total OCN) were predicted as the average of the preceding three years.River stocks are predicted based on a Ricker spawner-recruit relationshipplus a survival factor. The survival factor is the ratio of public hatcheryjacks to smolts in the previous year. The methodologies to estimate OPI abundance, including the abundance ofOCN coho, were reviewed by the Council's Scientific and Statistical Committee,and were determined by the Council to be based on the best scientific informationand methodology available in accordance with the seventh amendment to theFMP (52 FR 4146, February 10, 1987). The preseason estimate of OPI abundance in 1988 is 2,373,800 coho salmon,nearly 188 percent of the postseason estimate of OPI abundance in 1987(1,260,000 coho salmon). The 1988 estimate includes 480,300 OCN coho salmon, a slight increase overthe 1987 predicted abundance level (476,000). In 1987, the FMP was amendedto, among other things, provide a formula for annual alteration of theescapement goal for ONC coho salmon based on stock abundance (52 FR 4146).Based on the new formula, the annual escapment goal in 1987 and 1988 is200,000 OCN coho salmon. The goal was not achieved in 1987, but it is anticipatedthat it will be achieved in 1988. Ocean escapement is expected to be below framework FMP escapement rangesor goals for several Washington coastal and Puget Sound natural coho stocksin 1988. These include natural coho stocks from the Queets River, GraysHarbor, and Hood Canal. Several other Washington coastal and Puget Soundnatural coho stocks, such as those returning to the Hoh River, will notmeet spawning escapement goals after inside fisheries take place. Thesestocks have been severely impacted by Canadian coho catches off the westcoast of Vancouver Island, which have increased greatly in recent years.Federal, State, and tribal managers negotiated revised 1988 escapementgoals for these stocks based on the predicted very low stock abundanceand socio-economic concerns of treaty-Indian and non-Indian fishermen.<ITAG tagnum="84">Pink Salmon Stocks </ITAG>Major pink salmon runs return to the Fraser River and Puget Sound onlyin odd-numbered years. Consequently, pink salmon runs are not of managementconcern in 1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">Emergency Actions </ITAG>Facing critical resource conservation and socioeconomic problems in coastalsalmon fisheries and communities, the Council recommended, at its Aprilmeeting, 1988 annual management measures, some of which require deviationfrom the framework FMP and its implementing regulations. The Council determinedthese deviations to be necessary to address these identified problems thisseason and therefore requested that the Secretary implement the 1988 managementmeasures through the emergency authority of section 305(e) of the MagnusonAct. The Council's request for emergency changes to the FMP is based uponthe following:(1) The 1988 annual management measures, including the emergency changes,represent several complicated and negotiated compromises among numeroususer groups. The compromises are intended to protect, to the extent possible,the weakest salmon runs, to provide the greatest opportunity for usersto harvest the more abundant stocks, and to alleviate depressed economicconditions in the salmon fishing industry and its dependent communities;(2) There was insufficient time to amend the FMP through the formal MagnusonAct procedure between February, when biological data on the abundance ofcoastal salmon runs became available to the Council, and the first of May,when the major commercial fishing seasons begin;(3) Given the very low levels of allowable coho harvest in 1988 north ofCape Falcon and the depressed economic conditions of coastal communities,it is imperative that the 1988 management measures allow managers to makepreseason and inseason adjustments to ensure that all available coho andchinook quotas are harvested and that the season not end with unused quotasas has occurred in recent years;(4) Unless amended by this emergency rule, the current provisions of theframework FMP would deny southern Oregon commercial fishermen an equitableopportunity to harvest coho salmon; and(5) The emergency action to change the Klamath River fall chinook escapementgoal will accommodate, as much as possible, the recent agreement amongusers of Klamath River fall run chinook, which was signed by members ofthe Klamath Fishery Management Council. The agreement provides for a sharingof harvests between ocean and inside fisheries, and adequate escapementof chinook for spawning.The specific changes in the framework FMP and regulations requiring implementationthrough use of the emergency authority of the Magnuson Act are describedbelow:I. Allocation of Coho and Chinook Salmon North of Cape Falcon, OregonBased upon a request by the Council, NOAA issued a proposed rule (53 FR8234, March 14, 1988) to alter the schedule in the FMP in 1988 for allocatingcoho and chinook salmon between non-Indian ocean fisheries north of CapeFalcon, Oregon. The Council's request was denied by the Secretary of Commerceon March 29, 1988. Notification of withdrawal of that proposed rule willbe issued by NOAA. Among the reasons stated by NOAA for denying the rulewas that, based upon the Council's economic analysis, it appeared thateconomic losses would have occurred during 1988. The negative economicreturns would have resulted from the proposed allocation schedule and thepredicted extremely low abundance of coho and chinook salmon in the area.When the total allowable ocean harvest of coho salmon (100,000 fish) Northof Cape Falcon was adopted by the Council at its April 5-8 meeting, itbecame evident that the quantity of coho (34,000 fish) allocated to thecommercial fishery under the framework FMP was too small to be fully harvestedwithout leaving some of the coho quota uncaught. Thus, the Council adoptedan agreement reached between commercial and recreational representativesto trade the 34,000 commercial coho on a 4:1 basis for 8,500 recreationalchinook. In addition, the Council adopted a provision to reallocate anyunharvested commercial chinook to the recreational fishery at the end ofthe season. Both groups perceived benefits from the swap that would maximizethe value of both fisheries for 1988. However, the proposed species substitutionrepresents 34 percent of the total coho allocations whereas the frameworkFMP limits such swaps only to 25 percent of the allocation.The deviations from the framework regulations north of Cape Falcon willallow commercial fishermen a larger share of chinook salmon, which is themore commercially valuable species. In exchange, the increased share ofcoho salmon and any reallocated chinook not harvested during the commercialseason will extend the recreational season. The net economic benefit ofthese deviations from the framework regulations is estimated to be from$223,000 to $428,000.2. Commercial Coho Fishery North of Oregon-California Border in JuneCurrent framework regulations prohibit commercial fishing for coho salmonnorth of the California-Oregon border prior to July 1. However, the Counciladopted an all-species commercial season beginning June 5 in the KlamathRiver management zone (KMZ) which includes the Southern Oregon Coast southof Humbug Mountain. This season was designed to harvest the allowable oceancatch of Klamath River fall chinook and other chinook stocks in the KMZ.Because it is expected that the chinook quota in the zone will be takenby the end of June, the fishery is scheduled to be closed for the firsttwo weeks of July to limit any further impacts on Klamath River Fall chinook.After mid-July most coho have left the southern Oregon area and are nolonger available. Thus, the only opportunity for southern Oregon fishermento harvest coho salmon is during the June all-species fishery.A deviation from the framework regulations to implement a June all-speciesfishery in the Zone, both north and south of the state boundary, will providean opportunity for southern Oregon fishermen to harvest a fair share ofthe available coho salmon. The consistent all-species opening throughoutthe Zone also will help to prevent an effort shift to California in June.3. Klamath River Fall Chinook EscapementThe framework escapement goal for Klamath River fall chinook is to achievean average annual ocean escapement of 82,700 chinook to the mouth of theKlamath River during the 1987-1990 stock rebuilding period establishedunder the framework FMP. In 1987, the first year of the 1987-1990 four-yearperiod, 199,000 adult fall chinook entered the river. An average of only43,900 adult fish would be needed in the next three years of this periodto average 82,700 fish ocean escapement and thus meet the framework goal.Nevertheless, the 1988 preseason package includes ocean management measuresthat are anticipated to result in 132,000 fall chinook returning to themouth of the River.This deviation from the framework FMP's escapement goal is justified becausethe FMP anticipated that the escapement goal would have to be changed asin-river harvest allocations were agreed upon, and noted in the FMP thatwhen such an agreement was reached, the escapement goal would be modifiedby FMP amendment.In late 1987, the Klamath Fishery Management Council (Klamath Council),consisting of harvesters and managers of Klamath River chinook, agreedupon allocations of the fall chinook run for ocean and in-river fisheriesand for spawning escapement. The Klamath Council was established under16 U.S.C. 460 to, among other things, provide recommendations on oceanharvesting regulations to the Pacific Fishery Management Council [section3(b)(1)(B)(iii)]. The 1987 agreement was signed by representatives of Federal,State, and Tribal entities and commercial and recreational representatives.That same year, the Indian people of the Klamath River were allowed toconduct a commercial gillnet harvest under Bureau of Indian Affairs supervisionin the lower river (52 FR 27329, July 21, 1987) for the first year sinceCalifornia banned commercial gillnetting in 1933. The Indian net catchon the river was estimated to be 53,100 chinook salmon. The in-river sportfishery was estimated to take an additional 16,500 chinook in 1987, fora total in-river harvest of 69,600 chinook salmon. An estimated 129,300chinook escaped ocean and in-river fisheries to spawn in 1987.If applied in 1988, the 1987 agreement, the so-called ``Harvest SharingAgreement,'' would result in an in-river harvest of 67,300 chinook (downfrom 1987) and a spawning escapement of 85,300 adult fall chinook, includingboth hatchery and natural spawners. Together these would require an escapementfrom the ocean to the river of approximately 153,000 chinook in 1988, nearly21,000 more chinook than are expected to escape the ocean fisheries underthese Pacific Council's recommended regulations for 1988.On the other hand, if the in-river run size were limited to either theaverage goal in the Council's framework FMP for this period (82,700 chinook)or the average required for the next three years of the period (43,900chinook), there would be insufficient chinook left for in-river fisheriesand spawning escapement. The likely result would be an extremely low spawningescapement and the failure to meet even the hatchery goals.When developing the framework FMP escapement goal for Klamath chinook,the Council realized that the escapement averages contained in its frameworkFMP might have to be modified upward to reflect agreements on in-riverharvest sharing and spawning. However, at its April meeting, the PacificCouncil considered that ocean troll fishing off California and Oregon wouldhave to suffer too great an economic loss to achieve the 153,000 chinookescapement figure of the Klamath Council for 1988. Consequently, to easethe 1988 economic impacts on the ocean fisheries and coastal communities,the Pacific Council adopted a fishing regime that will result in an oceanescapement of 321,000 Klamath River fall run chinook, a compromise oceanescapement goal for Klamath River fall run chinook of 132,000 fish, some21,000 fewer fish than the 153,000 recommended by the Klamath Council.Ocean quotas for 1988 are based on this compromise. These recommendationswill provide increased economic return to the ocean fishery above whatit would have experienced had the Klamath Council's escapement recommendationbeen followed. At the same time, the recommendations of the Klamath Councilfor in-river harvests and threshold spawning escapements can come closeto being realized.The Council has begun the process of amending its framework FMP to addressthe Klamath River Council's fall chinook escapement goal. Other aspectsof that FMP amendment have delayed its implementation until at least 1989.For these reasons, the Council adopted 1988 ocean management measures,which are expected to provide 132,000 Klamath River fall chinook to themouth of the river.4. Definition of ``Land or Landing''The definition of ``land or landing'' in the framework regulations is asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Land </T3>or <T3>landing </T3>means to begin offloading fish, to arrive in port withthe intention of offloading fish, or to cause fish to be offloaded.</ITAG>The Council was told by its enforcement consultants that the current definitionis confusing, and it is difficult to determine when a fishermen intendsto offload. The revised definition which follows is intended to eliminatethis confusion, and to bring the salmon regulations into conformity withthe definition of ``landing'' regulations implementing other Council managementplans.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Land </T3>or <T3>landing </T3>means to begin transfer of fish from a fishing vessel.Once transfer begins, all fish aboard the vessel are considered part ofthe landing. </ITAG>Management Measures for 1988 The following tables and text are the management measures recommended bythe Council for 1988. Specific measures vary by fishery and area. Togetherthey establish fishing areas, seasons, quotas, legal gear, recreationalfishing days and catch limits, possession and landing restrictions, andminimum lengths for salmon taken in the exclusive economic zone (3-200nautical miles) off Washington, Oregon, and California. The Secretary concurswith these recommendations and finds them responsive to the goals of theFMP, the requirements of the resource, and the socio-economic conditionsaffected by ocean fisheries. The recommendations are consistent with therequirements of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act andother applicable law including United States obligations to Indian tribeswith treaty-secured fishing rights. The Northwest Regional Director will monitor salmon catches in the territorialsea (0-3 miles) seaward of Washington, Oregon, and California. If the RegionalDirector determines that salmon catches have occurred in the territorialsea or a portion thereof, which were not accounted for when the Federalquotas and seasons were established and which may cause the Federal quotasor the anticipated catch during the Federal seasons to be exceeded, hemay reduce the Federal quotas or shorten the Federal seasons accordinglyby publishing a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice pursuant to 661.21(b) and Appendix III.B.of the framework regulations. The following management measures are adopted for 1988 under Part 661.Table 1. Commercial management measures for the 1988 ocean salmon fishery:<ITAG tagnum="81">U.S.-Canada Border to Cape Falcon </ITAG>1. Minimum length restrictions for salmon in this area are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,r37,r37</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Total length</H1><H1>Head-Off</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Chinook <D>28.0 inches </D><D>21.5 inches. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Coho <D>16.0 inches </D><D>12.0 inches.</D></ITAG></ITAG> Chinook salmon less than 28 inches (21.5 inches head-off) may not be landednorth of Cape Falcon, except that chinook salmon not less than 26 inches(19.5 inches head-off) taken south of Cape Falcon may be landed north ofCape Falcon at times when the season is closed north of Cape Falcon andopen south of Cape Falcon. 2. Single point, single shank barbless hooks are required. 3. The non-Indian ocean fisheries north of Cape Falcon (recreational andtroll) will be managed not to exceed either (a) an overall 103,500 chinookquota, or (b) impact on critical Washington, coastal and Puget Sound naturalcoho stocks equivalent to the overall preseason coho quota of 100,000 fish.4. Conservation Zone 1, which is the ocean area surrounding the ColumbiaRiver mouth bounded by a line extending for 6 nautical miles due west fromNorth Head along 46anddegrees;18andmin172;00&quot; N. latitude to 124anddegrees;13andmin172;18&quot;W. longitude, then southerly along a line of 167anddegrees; True to 46anddegrees;11andmin172;06&quot;N. latitude and 124anddegrees;11andmin172;00&quot; W. longitude (Columbia RiverBuoy), then northeast along Red Buoy Line to the tip of the south jetty,is closed. 5. Two commercial all-except-coho seasons have been set for the area northof Cape Falcon. The first season, which begins May 1, has a 55,300 chinookquota.

Single point, single shank barbless hooks are required except that hooksused with bait and plugs may be barbed. 3. No more than 8 fixed lines per boat are allowed in the Hoh, Quileute,and Quinault areas. In the Makah area, no more than 8 fixed lines per boator no more than 4 hand-held lines per person are allowed. 4. All boundaries may be changed to include such areas as may hereafterbe authorized for the tribe's treaty fishery by a federal court. 5. There are no minimum length restrictions for salmon taken for ceremonialand subsistence purposes by the Makah tribe. For the Quileute, Hoh, andQuinault tribes, not more than 2 chinook salmon between the lengths of24 and 26 inches per day may be retained. 6. The overall ocean quotas for the Washington coastal tribes are: 60,000chinook and 68,000 coho salmon. These quotas include troll catches by theKlallam and Makah tribes in State of Washington Area 4B. 7. The areas within 6 nautical mile radii of the mouths of the Queens River(47anddegrees;31andmin172;42&quot; N. latitude) and the Hoh River (47anddegrees;15andmin172;12&quot;N. latitude) are closed to commercial fishing. A closure within 2 nauticalmiles of the mouth of the Quinault River (47anddegrees;21andmin172;00&quot; N. latitude)may be enacted by the Quinault Tribe and/or the State of Washington andwill not adversely affect the Secretary's management regime. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,i1,s48,r175,r175,r48</C>  <H1>Tribe</H1><H1>Boundaries</H1><H1>Open seasons</H1><H1>Salmon species</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Makah<D>That portion of the Fishery Management Area (FMA) north of 48</D>anddegrees;02andmin172;15&quot;N. latitude (Norwegian Memorial) and east of 125anddegrees;44andmin172;00 W.longitude<D>May 1 to earlier of June 30 or chinook quota</D><D>All except coho. </D><P>July 1 to earliest of September 30 or chinook or coho quota </P><P>All. </P></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quileute<D>That portion of the FMA between 48</D>anddegrees;07andmin172;36&quot; N. latitude(Sand Point) and 47anddegrees;31andmin172;42&quot; N. latitude (Queets River) andeast of 125anddegrees;44andmin172;00 W. longitude<D>May 1 to earlier of June 30 or chinook quota</D><D>All except coho. </D><P>July 1 to earliest of September 30 or chinook or coho quota</P><P>All. </P></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hoh<D>That portion of the FMA between 47</D>anddegrees;54andmin172;18&quot; N. latitude(Quillayute River) and 47anddegrees;21andmin172;00&quot; N. latitude (Quinault River)and east of 125anddegrees;44andmin172;00W. longitude<D>May 1 to earlier of June 30 or chinook quota</D><D>All except coho. </D><P>July 1 to earliest of September 30 or chinook or coho quota</P><P>All. </P></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quinault<D>That portion of the FMA between 47</D>anddegrees;40andmin172;06&quot; N. latitude(Destruciton Island) and 46anddegrees;53andmin172;18&quot; N. latitude (Point Chehalis)and east of 125anddegrees;44andmin172;00 W. longitude<D>May 1 to earlier of June 30 or chinook quota</D><D>All except coho. </D><P>July 1 to earliest of September 30 or chinook or coho quota</P><P>All.</P></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="84">Gear Definitions and Restrictions</ITAG>In addition to gear restrictions shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3, the followinggear definitions and restrictions will be in effect.<ITAG tagnum="84">Troll Fishing Gear</ITAG>Troll fishing gear for the Fishery Management Area (FMA) is defined asone or more lines that drag hooks behind a moving fishing vessel.In that portion of the FMA off Oregon and Washington, the line or linesmust be affixed to the vessel and must not be disengaged from the vesselat any time during the fishing operation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Recreational Fishing Gear</ITAG>Recreational fishing gear for the FMA is defined as angling tackle, consistingof a line with not more than one artificial lure or natural bait attached.In that portion of the FMA off Oregon and Washington, the line must beattached to a rod and reel held by hand or closely attended; the rod andreel must be held by hand while playing a hooked fish.

The aggregate data, upon which the measures are based,are available for public inspection at the offices of the Regional Directors(see ADDRESSES) during business hours until the end of the comment period.Preseason Notice of 1988 Management MeasuresMost of the actions in this rule are taken under 50 CFR Part 661 whichimplements the framework FMP. The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries,NOAA (Assistant Administrator) has determined that they are consistentwith the Magnuson Act and other applicable law, are in compliance withExecutive Order 12291, and are covered by the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis(RFA), and Final Supplemental Environment Impact Statement (SEIS), preparedfor the framework FMP. These actions impose no information collection requirementsunder the Paperwork Reduction Act.Section 661.23 of the framework regulations states that the Secretary willpublish a notice establishing management measures each year and will invitepublic comments prior to its effective date. If the Secretary determines,for good cause, that a notice must be issued without affording a prioropportunity for public comment, comments on the notice will be receivedby the Secretary for a period of 15 days after the effective date of thenotice.Because of the depressed status of some salmon stocks, and the need toreduce harvest in some areas or to establish different opening dates thanthose in the 1987 regulations for some fisheries, the Secretary has determinedthat time does not permit a comment period prior to the date the managementmeasures must be in effect. Comment will be accepted for 15 days afterthe effective date of this notice.The public has had opportunity to comment on these management measuresduring the process of their development. The public participated in theMarch and April Council, SST, and Salmon Advisory Subpanel meetings, andin public hearings held in Washington, Oregon, and California in late Marchand early April, which generated the management actions recommended bythe Council and approved by the Secretary. Written public comments wereinvited by the Council between the March and April Council meeting.<ITAG tagnum="84">Emergency Actions</ITAG>The Assistant Administrator also determined that the measures describedin the preamble which deviate from the framework FMP and its implementingregulations are necessary to respond to emergency situations and are consistentwith the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. The measures falling underemergency authority of section 305(e) of the Magnuson Act involve the followingas listed in the preamble: (1) Allocation of coho and chinok salmon northof Cape Falcon, Oregon, (2) commercial coho fishery north of Oregon-Californiaborder in June, (3) Klamath River Fall chinook escapement, and (4) definitionof landing. He has determined that continuation of the regulations whichthe emergency measures are intended to replace would not prevent overfishingand would not apportion the ocean harvest equitably among non-Indian commercialand recreational and treaty Indian fisheries, and that it is thereforenecessary to amend those portions of the framework FMP and its implementingregulations by emergency rule pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1855(e).The Assistant Administrator finds that the reasons justifying promulgationof this rule on an emergency basis also make it impracticable and contraryto the public interest to provide prior notice and opportunity for comment,or to delay for 30 days the effective date of these emergency regulations,as required by section 553 (b) and (d) of the Administrative ProcedureAct. The public had opportunities to comment on the substance of this emergencyrule during meetings of the Council and its advisory committees in Marchand April, 1988, as above. The public will also have an opportunity tocomment on the emergency measures during the comment period provided bythis rule.The Assistant Administrator had determined that this rule will be implementedin a manner that is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with theapproved coastal zone management programs of Washington, Oregon, California,and the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission. Thisdetermination has been submitted for review by the responsible agenciesunder section 307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act.This emergency rule is exempt from the normal review procedures of ExecutiveOrder 12291 as provided in section 8(a)(1) of that order. This rule isbeing reported to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget,with an explanation of why it is not possible to follow the regular proceduresof that order.The Council prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for this action andconcluded that there will be no significant impact on the human environment.A copy of the EA is available from the Regional Directors (see <T2>ADDRESSES</T2>).This emergency rule does not contain a collection of information for purposesof the Paperwork Reduction Act.The Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply to this rule because, asan emergency rule, it was not required to be promulgated as a proposedrule and the rule is issued without opportunity for prior public comment.Since notice and opportunity for comment are not required to be given undersection 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act, and since no other lawrequires that notice and opportunity for comment be given for this rule,under sections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act no initialor final regulatory flexibility analysis has to be or will be prepared.This emergency rule does not contain policy with known federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of the federalism assessment under ExecutiveOrder 12612. Washington, Oregon, and California are expected to implementState regulations compatible with the Federal rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 661</ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing, Indians.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 29, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Rolland Schmitten,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine FisheriesService.</ITAG>For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 50 CFR Part 661 and its Appendixare amended, to be effective from May 1, 1988, through July 29, 1988, asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 661_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
