Scatteringangle dependent probabilities and integral cross sections for Coulombfission were calculated. It is concluded that earlier observed discrepanciesbetween measured and calculated angular distributions for the one-neutrontransfer product /sup 239/U cannot be explained by sequential fission.Multi-nucleon transfer induced fission is observed down to energies (0.90+- 0.02) x V/sub C/.</TEXT></DOC>
