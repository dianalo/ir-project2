The woman, Jeannette Linda Shurtleff of Lake Elsinore, Calif., had been a test technician on the troubled Sgt. York anti-aircraft gun, which the Pentagon canceled two years ago after it had become a symbol of inefficiency in weapons procurement.    The 33-year-old Ms. Shurtleff was fired in July 1985 for insubordination after refusing to work with another member of the test crew. She had been working at the $24,000-a-year job for about 21 months. Her attorney, Richard Grey of Los Angeles, said the award by an Orange County Superior Court jury consisted of $100,000 in punitive damages and $7,200 for lost wages.    A spokeswoman for Ford Aerospace said the company doesn't agree with the verdict and may appeal. </TEXT></DOC>
