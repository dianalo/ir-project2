The slaughter, which over the years has seen more than 80percent of the park's herd perish, will continue until the illegalivory trade is halted, said Esmond Bradley-Martin, an Americanconservationist who has lived in Kenya for nearly 25 years and isan expert on elephant ivory and rhino horn trade.   ``The short-term prognosis for elephants is dim,'' he said.``People realize ivory is worth a lot outside the country. Theyessentially are raping a natural resource.''   Prices have reached $73 a pound, up from about $20 a pound fiveyears ago, he said.   An aerial survey in February of Tsavo and its surroundingecosystem found 5,363 elephants, about a third the number at thebeginning of the decade.   The herd is about one-sixth the estimated 35,000 that remainedin 1974 after a five-year drought killed 9,000, according to thesurvey sponsored by the European Economic Commission, the EastAfrican Wildlife Society and the Kenyan government.   Most of the bleached bones and rotted carcasses spotted in the15,385-square-mile area were of elephants killed more than a yearago, according to the survey.   Tedd Goss, coordinator of anti-poaching efforts for Kenya'sMinistry of Wildlife, credited intensified efforts by reinforcedanti-poaching units in Tsavo with keeping the slaughter fromgetting even worse.   The slaughter of elephants by poachers is not confined to Kenyaand at the current rate of killings, Africa's elephants couldconceivably be wiped out in eight to 10 years.   But experts say it is not likely the world's biggest land animalwill be hunted into extinction. They explained the elephants willcontinue to retreat to protected areas or deep into forests, makingit more difficult for poachers to find them.   However, the Tsavo slaughter dramatizes an alarming decline inelephant populations already evident from detailed counts taken ofEast Africa's closely studied herds.   Studies by the Nairobi-based United Nations EnvironmentalProgram (UNEP) indicate a drop in population since 1973 of 85percent in Kenya and 89 percent in neighborng Uganda. Anotherneighbor Tanzania, has lost 53 percent of its elephants in the last10 years.   ``Everyone knows that for years poachers have been killingelephants for ivory,'' Iain Douglas-Hamilton, a Scottish elephantexpert in Nairobi, wrote recently in Swara, the East AfricanWildlife Society's bi-monthly magazine.   ``What nobody appears to be aware of, other than a few wardensand wildlife scientists, is the extent of the destruction ofelephants in East Africa and how fast the remaining elephants aredisappearing.''   Douglas-Hamilton, who helped assemble the UNEP data, saidinformation is scanty for the rest of Africa. But he added thatavailable information paints a picture that is similar to or worsethan the elephants' situation in East Africa.   An estimated 750,000 elephants remain in all of Africa, downfrom about 1.3 million in the late 1970s, according toBradely-Martin. The amount of ivory traded in the world marketthrough 1985 averaged about 800 tons a year, representing anofftake of about 75,000 elephants annually, he said.   He estimated that an additional 100 tons remains in Africa whereit is ``carved up and sold on the tourist market.''   In the mid-1980s, perhaps 50 percent of all ivory leaving Africawas illegal, according to Bradley-Martin, who said more currentdata were not available.   Legal ivory is that which has been obtained through sanctionedculls of elephant herds, or from natural deaths.   ``There is absolutely no way poaching could continue withoutsenior collaboration in governments and business,'' Bradley-Martinsaid.   In January, Kenya's Ministry of Wildlife fired seven officialsand disciplined eight field officers suspected of helping poachersor embezzling funds. It also named a new director.   Hong Kong also is cracking down on the illegal ivory marketthere and has imposed heavy fines and jail terms for peopleconvicted of importing raw ivory without a license.   Hong Kong and Japan are the world's largest consumers of ivory,along with the United States, which is considering legislation thatwould stop almost all ivory imports.   Douglas-Hamilton believes the elephant slaughter will stop onlywhen the ivory trade is banned altogether.   ``Don't buy it, don't wear it, don't sell it,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Tues PMs May 31</NOTE></DOC>
