The body of Dulcie September, 45, was found in her northeastParis apartment building, which also served as an office for thegroup.   Mrs. September had represented the ANC in France, Switzerlandand Luxembourg since 1984. The anti-apartheid group is outlawed inSouth Africa.   An ANC colleague said Mrs. September recently told InteriorMinistry officials that she had received threats and was beingfollowed.   No group or individual immediately claimed responsibility forthe attack, but ANC officials blamed South Africa. South Africadenied involvement.   The French news agency Agence-France Press reported Mrs.September was shot in the face while entering her office about 9a.m. Her body was found surrounded by shells from a .22-caliberrifle.   She was holding letters in her hand and a key was in the door ofthe fourth-floor office, AFP reported. Sources at the scene saidher attacker apparently was waiting when she arrived to begin hernormal working day.   Maurice Cukierman, an ANC treasurer in the office, said Mrs.September had ``informed the Ministry of the Interior that she hadreceived threats and that she had been followed during the last fewdays.''   ``It is with anger that I learned of her assassination,especially since we had advised French authorities that SouthAfrica was ready to commit assassinations in Europe,'' he said.   Eddy Amkongo, representative in France for the Southwest AfricanPeoples Organization, told reporters at the scene of the killingthat he had also been threatened and had requested protection fromthe French government.   ``But until today we have received no response,'' he said.   The Interior Ministry declined to confirm or deny whether it hadreceived requests for protection from the African groups.   Police, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theassassination looked like ``the work of a professional.''   At ANC headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, spokesman Tom Sebinacalled the killing ``part of a deliberate South African campaign toassassinate ANC members and ANC leaders.''   Without citing any evidence, Sebina linked Mrs. September'skilling to a recent series of attacks carried out by the SouthAfrican military against what the South African army called ANC``terrorists.''   Since Friday the South African army has killed 11 people inraids in Botswana, near the Botswana border with South Africa andin the black homeland of Venda.   Sebina said he did not know whether any of the 11 people killedin the raids were affiliated with the ANC.   South African Foreign Minister Roloef Pik Botha suggested thedeath may have been the result of an internal quarrel within theANC.   Pretoria ``cannot be held responsible for this death,'' theforeign minister said in a statement issued through the SouthAfrican Embassy. ``While details concerning the assassination arenot yet known, the (South African) government must stress thatserious quarrels exist within organizations which use violence toattain their political objectives.''   The ANC, the main black guerrilla group fighting to overthrowthe South Africa government, maintains a worldwide network of about20 ``information offices,'' including several in Europe, to lobbyfor support and receive aid.   The ANC was banned by South Africa in 1960 for itsanti-apartheid activities. Since then, it has waged a bombing asabotage campaign to wrest control from the government in Pretoria.   The Soviet Union is the ANC's chief military supplier. ANCleader Nelson Mandela has been jailed in South Africa since 1962.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote innational affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
