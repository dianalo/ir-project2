(mass production ofmicroelectronic valves)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Eccles, Martin.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Microelectronic valve research has progressed rapidly in recentyears and mass production may not be far away.andP;  A good deal of thegroundwork on the valves has been done at SRI International.andO;Breakthroughs were made there with molybdenum-cathode tips, butthe manufacturing process to make them is complex.andP;  GEC HirstResearch Centre in Great Britain has developed a technique toproduce metal tips using existing semiconductor fabricationtechnology.andP;  The new valves will find a ready market if they startbeing mass produced.andP;  Microelectronic valves work at hightemperatures and are resistant to radiation, which makes themattractive to the aerospace and reactor industries.andP;  Their successdepends on further development of the manufacturing process.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   SRI International (research).andO;Topic:     United KingdomMicroelectronicsIntegrated Circuit FabricationResearch and DevelopmentHigh Technology.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
