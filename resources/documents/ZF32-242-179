TomlinsonandM;Albany, N.Y.andP;  -- Apple independent dealers, the mom-and-pop stores of theMacintosh channel, were key rungs in Apple's ladder to success.andP;  But in theclimb, a number of these small resellers got squashed, making Apple-onlyindependent dealers an endangered species.andM;&quot;Apple is the only manufacturer that has brand-specific dealers,&quot; said JohnCrowe, president of Memory Bank Computer Center in Virginia Beach, Va., andchairman of the Apple Dealers Association.andP;  &quot;Some 25 percent of the Macchannel are Apple-only dealers.andP;  No other computer company has that kind ofloyalty.&quot;andM;Some of those dealers have often expressed frustration with Apple's pricingand marketing policies, charging, for instance, that many of the company'smarketing programs favor higher-volume resellers at the expense of smaller,Apple-only independents.andM;But some resellers didn't see it that way.andM;&quot;Apple's re-emphasis on the dealer channel and the independents in particularis helping us,&quot; said Mark Bogossian, general manager of Castle Computers Inc.andO;of Latham, N.Y.andP;  If, for example, Apple had decided to go to the mass-marketchannel with the low-cost Macs, Bogossian noted, it would have crippledindependents because the small operations couldn't hope to compete with largechains.andM;Despite this, a scarcity of Classics is costing resellers.andM;&quot;I can blame [a lot of] lost sales on the lack of product since the newlow-ends came out,&quot; said Tobias Kaye, president of Towson Computer in Towson,Md.andP;  Towson Computer is part of a buying affiliation, which Kaye said helpshim stay profitable.andM;In fact, buying affiliations were created so that independent dealers couldcompete for deals usually reserved for high-volume chains.andM;&quot;Chains are typically not focused on Apple,&quot; said Crowe.andP;  &quot;To them it's asideline.andP;  To me it's my lifeblood.andP;  If you were going to have anappendectomy, who would you want to do it?andP;  The general practi-tioner downthe road or the specialist?&quot;andM;Bogossian said it all comes down to focus.andP;  &quot;We've got a very clear,predefined focus,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It's a commitment to long-term support, notjust rhetoric.&quot;andM;With the Classic bringing in novice users who need personal attention,Bogossian said, the importance of small independents to the new Mac market isgreater than ever before.andM;Crowe agreed, saying he'd rather sell 15 Macs at $1,000 than one Mac at$15,000.andP;  Support is where independents excel, and the new Macs need thatsupport, he said.andM;Crowe also attributes Memory Bank's survival to its buying affiliation withMicroAge, a program he said he was instrumental in starting.andP;  He said hebelieves that truly independent dealers, those without an affiliation, arethe most endangered.andM;But Bogossian, who isn't part of an affiliation, finds little trouble gettingwhat he needs.andP;  For example, when most dealers couldn't get the Macintosh LCin December, Bogossian had some to sell.andM;But survival for independents in the '90s, Kaye said, comes down to this: &quot;Weput teeth into added-value.andP;  There are very large dealers who feel they canbuy market share by giving away computers.andP;  They wake up one day to findthey've lost money.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
