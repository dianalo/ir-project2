Talks between the United Mine Workers and Pittston resumed atmidmorning today after breaking off shortly after midnight as thetwo sides sought to meet a mediator's hope that the bitter andsometimes violent strike be settled by Christmas.   Principals in the talks did not speak to reporters because of agag order, but sources said considerable progress was made Thursdayand Friday. Still, an agreement has proved elusive because ofoutstanding disputes.   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, hoping an agreement was near,delayed plans to travel to her native North Carolina for Christmasand remained in Washington so she could participate if a settlementis announced. It was Dole who named the supermediator for the talks.   The two sides began around-the-clock negotiations early thisweek, and word that a settlement might be imminent surfaced atmid-week as UMW President Richard Trumka and Pittston Chairman PaulDouglas were called into the talks.   Mediator W.J. Usery pledged to seek a settlement by Christmasthat would allow the nearly 1,700 miners from Virginia, WestVirginia and Kentucky to return to work after the traditionalholiday shutdown of the mines.   Although the strike involves just 1,700 miners, it holds broadimplications for the UMW and the mining industry as a whole. Thedispute between the miners and Pittston over retiree healthbenefits threatens to undermine a decades-old compact betweenmining companies and the UMW guaranteeing retired miners fullhealth benefits.   Pittston last year refused to participate in the compact, theBituminous Coal Operators Association agreement, because itobjected to the new funding formula. Pittston was unable to reachagreement with the miners on an alternate plan and had stoppedpayments into union pension and medical funds.   Usery, a former labor secretary and veteran mediator, was tappedas supermediator by Mrs. Dole in late October, shortly after shevisited with Pittston strikers in the Virginia coal fields.   The dispute over funding the retirement plans led the miners tostrike April 5 after 17 months of failed contract talks withPittston's mining subsidiary, Pittston Coal Group. The miners hadworked for 14 months without a contract when they struck.   The union has paid the strikers about $200 a week in benefitsand is facing fines totaling $63.5 million for violating courtorders limiting picketing and other strike activities. Last weekthe union said it would give each striker a $1,250 Christmas bonus,sweetening a prior offer to give them interest-free loans.   Pittston hired replacements to operate the mines but productionhas been well below pre-strike levels, and industry analysts saidit appeared the company has been forced to buy coal to keep up withits supply commitments.   Pittston reported that its coal operations lost $3.6 million inthe second quarter of 1989 and $9.8 million in the third, comparedto profits of $9 million and $7.4 million in the respectivequarters of 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
