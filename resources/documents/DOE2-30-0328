The conclusion from the previousproject was that a traditional working process with much labour on thebuilding site made the approach uneconomic. With this background thepresent project was initiated with the purpose of demonstrating thatprefabrication of insulating components would give technically good solutionsat a more competitive price. In contrast to the previous project, onlysolutions for gable walls were considered in this project. In this waycomplicated fittings around windows were avoided. In the present reporttwo different types of components are described. For demonstration purposesthey have both been mounted on two gable walls in Central Copenhagen.For one of the gables fairly small components, 1,8 m x 0,8 m, were chosen.They were made of glass fiber, reinforced concrete shells with a 100mm mineral wool insulation. For the other project large components, 3,0m x 3,0 m, were chosen. They were made of coated steel panels fixed tosteel profiles and with a 125 mm mineral wool insulation. The fibre-reinforcedconcrete components were mounted by hand from a scafford whereas thelarger steel components were mounted by means of building lifts. (EG).</TEXT></DOC>
