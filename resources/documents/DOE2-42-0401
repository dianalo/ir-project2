The first oil discoverywas made in 1974, one hundred kilometers offshore in 126 meters waterdepth. Thirty oil and gas fields have been discovered so far. The mainproducing reservoirs are sandstones but production is also obtained fromlimestones, Early Cretaceous to Miocene in age. Campos Basin productionstarted in August 1977, through a floating production system with onesingle well producing 12,000 BOPD. As of December, 1987, the averagedaily output of the basin was 367,000 BOPD. Campos Basin proved reservesat the end of 1987, using 500 m (1,640 ft) as water depth cut off, reached1.6 billion barrels of oil and 39.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas(1.4 Tcf). Deep water discoveries as from 1984 are expected to increasethe total reserves to 7.0 billion barrels of oil and over 100 billioncubic meters of natural gas (3.5 Tcf). Floating Production Systems withsubsea completions are being widely used as the main technique for petroleumrecovery from small and medium size fields in Campos Basin. Nineteenof those systems were installed, redeployed or discontinued, arrivingto the current configuration of 12 systems and more than 100 subsea completions,five of which in waters deeper than 380 meters.</TEXT></DOC>
