North-West proposed to issue a Class B common with 10 times the votes but lower dividends than ordinary common. Doing so would ensure voting control for the Allen family, which holds 44.2% of the company.    North-West shares closed unchanged at $24 in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.    North-West has about 1.3 million shares outstanding. The company said shareholders will vote on the proposal at a special meeting on Jan. 20. </TEXT></DOC>
