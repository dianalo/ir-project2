White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday the ``previousadministration left an excellent foundation on which to build. ...There will be a considerable degree of continuity'' by the U.S.negotiators.   Yuri Nazarkin, the new leader of the Soviet delegation, indicatedupon arrival in Geneva that Moscow's fundamental positions alsoremain unchanged.   The new chief U.S. envoy is Richard Burt, former ambassador toWest Germany. He will lead the American delegation in the START(Strategic Arms Reduction Talks) negotiations.   The new round is expected to last about six weeks.   Parallel to the START talks, the two sides also will reopennegotiations on space and defense issues. Lem Masterkov continues asthe top Soviet negotiator in the START talks.   U.S. officials said they will ask the Soviets to agree to trymethods for monitoring reductions of some long-range missiles. Themethods have been written into the draft of a proposed treaty.   Neither side has indicated possible movement on three otherdisputed areas _ U.S. plans for space-based missiles defenses, knownas the Star Wars plan; sea-launched cruise missiles, and how to dealwith mobile missiles.   The Soviets oppose the Star Wars plan and want to limitsea-launched cruise missiles.   Burt has said a START treaty must ``fully protect our options fordeveloping and deploying'' missile defenses in space.   Much of a draft treaty to cut each side's long-range (strategic)nuclear forces by 30 to 50 percent has been accepted by bothdelegations in the 10 previous rounds of the talks that began inMarch 1985.   The pact is intended to cover nuclear weapons that the twosuperpowers could use to strike each other, including sea- andland-based missiles as well as heavy bombers.   Delegates are to begin by reviewing agreements already containedin the 400-page draft text.   The talks recessed Nov. 15 and were scheduled to reopen inFebruary but Bush ordered a delay for a reassessment of U.S.policies. Secretary of State James Baker III and Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev agreed last month on the resumption.   Among the agreements reached in earlier rounds are loweredceilings of 6,000 nuclear warheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles _missiles and bombers _ for each side. Outlines of a system formonitoring compliance were also set.</TEXT></DOC>
