Its bleak picture of Reagan's handling of the Iran-Contra affair is bound to damage him in congressional dealings on the budget, Star Wars and Contra aid. Meanwhile, Kemp pollster Lance Tarrance predicts the report dooms Bush's hopes of putting the issue to rest any time soon. &quot;We now have a political soap opera that's longer than a mini-series,&quot; he says.    Other GOP presidential hopefuls play the controversy warily. Kemp's camp goes out of its way not to attack the vice president, feeling that Bush will suffer enough anyway. Dole emphasizes the &quot;colossal blunders&quot; in the policy. His strategists believe the report will fuel, in the campaign ahead, a public demand for &quot;competence&quot; and for someone with hands-on experience -- like Dole.    But pollster Tarrance says: &quot;This shifts the momentum to the Democrats on the presidential level.&quot;    TRADE TENSIONS with Japan threaten to heat up again.    U.S. officials grow more frustrated over seeming Japanese recalcitrance on some highly visible issues, including semiconductors, airport construction and supercomputers. Congressional pressure mounts for action to make the U.S. look tough and ease voter fears that Japan is taking over.    Japanese lobbyists admit the situation is &quot;deteriorating.&quot; Last week's finance ministers' accord could help reduce pressures on Japan -- provided Tokyo can deliver on its promises to stimulate its economy and buy more imports. But Nakasone has already been battered at home for allowing the yen's rise and is having trouble getting parliament to approve budget and tax proposals.    HART'S LEAD among Democrats is tenuous, but rivals all have weaknesses.    With Cuomo's withdrawal from the presidential race, the former Colorado senator has a big lead in the polls, is establishing an impressive organization and is staking out detailed positions. But many political insiders note that his strong suit is insurgency rather than front-runner status; others say his personal style won't wear well.    Cuomo hints his own favorites are Sen. Bumpers and Gov. Dukakis. Both are expected to enter the race soon, but their hesitancy so far raises questions about their commitment to a tough race. Rep. Gephardt is off to an impressive start and could do well in the Iowa caucuses, but some Democratic pollsters doubt that his protectionist appeal can survive a national test.    The Democrats' Jesse Jackson problem persists. One leading black Democrat says that, unlike the case in 1984, few major black officeholders can afford to oppose him this time.    INSIDE MOVES? Veteran lobbyist Tom Korologos, a close Dole ally, urges making Howard Baker secretary of state. Korologos, who was summoned to the White House this week to help plot post-Tower Commission strategy, had previously talked up Baker for the CIA; such a high-level job would probably keep him out of the 1988 presidential race, benefiting Dole.    BARGAINING CHIP: Seeking to discourage Senate efforts to roll back the congressional pay raise, some House members threaten a ban on accepting honorariums for speeches. Honorariums are much more important to senators than to House members. &quot;It's the grenade that hasn't been thrown yet,&quot; says one House Democratic aide.    BENTSEN'S BILL on trade riles Japanese policy makers. They are upset that it calls for tougher retaliation against economic &quot;adversaries&quot;; the nearest equivalent in Japanese translation is &quot;enemies.&quot; Japanese officials push to get the wording changed, but a U.S. official says: &quot;Let 'em worry about it for a while.&quot;    CONFLICTING DEMANDS? Former Reagan aide Michael Deaver spent part of the last two weeks planning strategy with the president's wife on replacing Chief of Staff Regan -- and the rest of the time huddling with his lawyers on maneuvers to block his criminal indictment.    QUESTIONS MOUNT about the Pentagon's new weapons-acquisition czar.    Former Bechtel executive Richard Godwin, appointed to quell congressional demands for reforms, faces tough scrutiny after a four-month honeymoon in office. A House subcommittee plans hearings this summer on the Defense Department's reorganization; an aide wonders whether Godwin &quot;might not be getting rolled&quot; by the military services.    Questions are also raised over Godwin's overruling of Navy Secretary Lehman's attempt to kill the Deadeye guided projectile. The Pentagon came under strong pressure from lawmakers from Alabama, where a company bidding to make the weapon is based; some suggest Godwin caved in. He also may come under fire for a new plan to restructure the weapons-testing office.    At a recent symposium, a roomful of defense contractors hissed at an organization chart of Godwin's new weapons-purchasing bureaucracy.    MINOR MEMOS: Comedian Mark Russell's new name for the Iran-Contra scandal: &quot;Seniligate.&quot; . . . Dole says he and his wife, the transportation secretary, are experiencing &quot;presidential fever -- I call her and she hangs up on me.&quot; . . . Behind the times: Boasting that he will &quot;change the terms of debate&quot; on trade, Kemp unveils his new proposal -- &quot;The American Trade, Growth and Employment Act of 1986.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
