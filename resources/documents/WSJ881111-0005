While the composite and many other OTC barometers rose, indexes of the largest stocks fell. The Nasdaq 100 index of the OTC market's largest non-financial issues -- including SafeCard and such other decliners as Intel, Microsoft and Subaru of America -- slipped 0.44 to 346.55. Most such OTC indexes have been stuck in a range all fall.    Overall, Nasdaq advancers led decliners 1,041 to 910 on light volume of 105.3 million shares. Without the market's top stocks leading a rally that would entice small investors back to the OTC scene, the market is doomed to stagnation, traders said.    William Rothe, managing director and head of OTC trading at Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc., Baltimore, said, &quot;Small investors are still skittish and need some kind of a trend to develop to have them come back to the marketplace.&quot;    SafeCard took its tumble of 1 3/8 to 6 1/8 on a report that federal agents executed a search warrant on its premises in mid-October in connection with a criminal investigation by the Internal Revenue Service. The report was attributed to an IRS source. The target of the investigation, which was confirmed by a second government official, couldn't immediately be determined.    While the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., company hasn't been commenting on the situation, it did issue a brief statement saying it had been told by the IRS &quot;that SafeCard is not a target or subject of any Internal Revenue Service investigation.&quot;    SafeCard, which notifies credit-card issuers of lost or stolen cards, is one of the country's biggest credit-card protection concerns. It has market value of about $200 million.    Nutmeg Industries slipped 1 1/8 to 8 5/8 in light trading, even though the Tampa, Fla., apparel company announced it was licensed by the Major League Baseball Players Association to make and sell sportswear with names, faces and signatures of players. Nutmeg, with market value of about $40 million, already makes products with team symbols.    Investors could learn something about how the initial public offering market works from the massive trading in Genus, a small issue introduced jointly yesterday by Alex. Brown and Cowen andamp; Co.    Genus is a Mountain View, Calif., maker of production equipment for large integrated circuits. The stock closed at 5 1/8, a gain of 1/8 from its offering price.    &quot;Flippers&quot; were out in full force on the offering of two million shares, causing first-day volume of more than one million shares. Genus, in fact, wound up fifth on the Nasdaq most-active list. Flippers are traders who acquire and then immediately sell public-offering shares.    With the initial-offering market so bearish, such traders have been selling off new issues the day they come out -- even those that aren't wildly overpriced. Genus, for example, had an offering range of $8 to $10 when the company filed for its offering in August. Yet it still attracted flippers even with that price lowered to $5.    Big Bear slipped 2 1/4 to 26 1/4. The Columbus, Ohio, supermarket operator reported earnings of 27 cents a share for its fourth quarter, ended Aug. 27, below the 34 cents it earned in the year-earlier quarter.    20th Century Industries surged 1 7/8 to 17 5/8 on heavy volume of nearly 1.2 million shares. The insurer reported third-quarter operating profit of 77 cents a share, compared with 40 cents a year earlier. The stock was helped by news that the California Supreme Court blocked implementation of a proposition that would force auto liability insurers to slash rates by 20% from 1987 levels. Wednesday, 20th Century and other insurers in the California auto market fell on news of the proposition's passage. Among them, Mercury General rose 1 1/8 to 14 5/8 yesterday after losing 1/8 Wednesday, and Safeco rebounded 1/2 to 24 7/8 after Wednesday's 3/8-point drop.    In takeover action: Banks of Iowa added 2 1/2 to 65. The Des Moines bank holding company said its board is reviewing alternatives to a proposed takeover by First Bank System, including its possible sale to another party.    Air Cargo Equipment gained 1/2 to 8 1/2 on news of a planned $8.50-a-share tender offer from Omni Holding, a Swiss company. Air Cargo is already the target of an $8-a-share bid from Zero. </TEXT></DOC>
