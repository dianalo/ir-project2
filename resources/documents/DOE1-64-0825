The author examines the issues that drive it: the majorthreats to the ABM Treaty, ranging from Soviet radar deployments to thetesting of weapons in space; the role of defense constraints in offensivearms reduction; the possible risk of an unconstrained arms race shouldABM limits be eased or removed; and the conflict reports about Sovietarms control compliance practices. He assesses three paths for U.S. policy:away from the ABM Treaty toward nationwide missile defense; away fromSDI toward strengthened ABM Treaty; or toward limited defense for strategicforces.</TEXT></DOC>
