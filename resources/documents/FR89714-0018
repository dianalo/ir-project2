The amendments, enactedon October 25, 1988, require creditors to give written notice to businesscredit applicants of their right to a written statement of reasons forcredit denials or other adverse action. The law also requires creditorsto maintain records used in evaluating credit applications. The proposed revisions to Regulation B would implement the statutory amendmentsand define coverage. Coverage of business credit applications generallywould depend on the applicant's gross revenues: an application would besubject to the amendments if it involves a business applicant with grossrevenues of $500,000 or less, except in the case of an application fortrade credit and similar types of credit. The latter applications and applicationsfrom businesses with gross revenues greater than $500,000 would remainsubject to modified rules currently provided by andSection;202.3(d) of RegulationB, although certain revisions to that section are also being proposed bythe Board at this time.    The Board will adopt a final rule following a 60-day comment period, afterreview of the comments received. The Board contemplates issuing a finalrule by late October 1989, with an effective date of January 1, 1990. Untilthen, the existing rules of Regulation B continue in effect.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE:</T2> Comments must be received on or before September 15, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments should be mailed to William W.

The ECOA also provides that a credit applicanthas the right to obtain a written statement of reasons for a denial ofcredit. The ECOA is implemented by the Board's Regulation B, 12 CFR Part202. A staff commentary to the regulation, 12 CFR Part 202 Supp. I, appliesand interprets the requirements of Regulation B. Pursuant to authority granted under section 703(a) of the ECOA, 12 U.S.C.1691b(a), the Board has previously provided limited exceptions, set forthin andSection;202.3 of Regulation B, from certain of the regulation's requirementsfor the following types of credit: Credit extensions involving public utilityservices; credit extensions subject to regulation under the SecuritiesExchange Act; credit payable in four or fewer installments, in which nocredit card is used and no finance charge is imposed (``incidental credit'');extensions of credit to federal and state governments; and extensions ofcredit primarily for business, commercial or agricultural purposes (``businesscredit''). The current exceptions for business credit relate to the following areas:Written notification of credit denials, record retention, marital statusinquiries, and supplying information to third parties about accounts heldjointly by married persons. Business credit transactions remain subjectto all other    provisions of Regulation B (which includes for example,rules that make it unlawful for a creditor automatically to require loanguarantees from a nonapplicant spouse). The Women's Business Ownership Act amendments to the ECOA For a number of years, members of Congress and others have expressed concernthat the business credit exceptions under Regulation B do not provide businesscredit applicants, particularly small-business owners, with adequate rightsunder the ECOA. On October 25, 1988, the ECOA was amended by the Women'sBusiness Ownership Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-533, 102 Stat. 2689. Theseamendments to the ECOA require creditors to (1) give business credit applicantswritten notice of the right to obtain reasons for a credit denial and (2)retain records on business credit applications for at least one year, pursuantto the Federal Reserve Board's implementing regulation. The statutory provision governing the Board's rulewriting authority alsowas amended to provide that any exemption from the requirement of the actor implementing regulation issued by the Board will end after five years.The Board may extend an exemption for an additional five-year period ifthe Board makes an express finding that an extension is appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="84">(2) The Proposed Revisions to Regulation B </ITAG>The Board proposes to revise Regulation B to implement the ECOA amendmentsregarding notice of credit denials and record retention; define the businesscredit applications to which the revised rules will apply; and revise theregulatory provisions that will govern all other business credit transactions.General Coverage The legislative history makes clear that the primary intent of the statutoryamendments is to provide small-business owners, particularly women entrepreneurs,the same ECOA rights that are afforded to consumer credit borrowers. Thereis evidence of congressional intent that the amendments should not applyto applications by large corporations or to certain types of business credit(such as applications for trade credit and credit incident to factoringarrangements). <T3>See </T3>House Committee on Small Business, Selected Documents Pertainingto the Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988, 100th Cong. 2d Sess. (Comm.Print). There is, however, no commonly accepted definition of a small business.The Board therefore considered various tests for determining coverage forpurposes of the ECOA and Regulation B_for example, the asset size of thebusiness entity, and the number of employees of the business entity. Inmany instances, however, the correlation between ``small'' and some ofthese characteristics depends on the nature of the business, industry dominance,and other factors. The Board also considered using the size of the loantransaction, but transaction size does not differentiate between small-and large-business credit applicants. Wanting to provide a simple testfor determining coverage of transactions by Regulation B, the Board ultimatelydecided to propose a cutoff based on gross revenues. Applications from businesses that had gross revenues of $500,000 or lessin the preceding fiscal year would be subject to regulatory provisionsimplementing the statutory amendments on notice of credit denials and recordretention. (A creditor would be permitted to rely on the applicant's assertionsabout the revenue size of the business). Applications to start a businesswould be included in this category. Applications for trade credit, creditincident to factoring arrangements, and similar types of credit_as Wellas credit applications from businesses with revenues exceeding $500,000_wouldcontinue to be subject to the modified rules for notification and recordretention set forth in andSection; 202.3(d)(3) of Regulation B, discussedlater in this notice. The $500,000 cutoff which the Board is proposing would provide coveragefor credit applications involving some 70 percent of the businesses operatingtoday. The Board believes that this test would ensure ECOA rights for mostsmall businesses and at the same time not cover very large corporate entities.In seeking an appropriate dollar cutoff to delineate a small-business entity,for purposes of the ECOA and Regulation B, the Board looked to other legislationfor guidance. The dollar test being proposed_$500,000 in gross revenues_correspondsto the test that was used to establish an exemption for small businessesunder the minimum wage legislation recently passed by both the Senate andthe House of Representatives. <T3>See </T3>Amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act, H.R. 2, 100thCong. 2d Sess. (1989)(subsequently vetoed by the President). Notice of the Right to Reasons for a Credit Denial The statutory amendments require creditors to inform business loan applicants,in writing, of the right to a written statement of the reasons for a denialof their loan applications. Under the Board's proposal, creditors wouldfollow the notification rules in andSection; 202.9(a)(3) of Regulation B,a new provision governing credit applications from businesses with $500,000or less in gross revenues. Applications from businesses with revenues exceedingthat amount would be governed by andSection; 202.3(d) of the regulation,discussed below. The proposed rules applicable to business credit closely parallel the rulesthat govern nonbusiness credit. Creditors that follow the present RegulationB rules governing nonbusiness credit will be in full compliance with theact and regulation. The Board's proposal does, however, contain one ortwo provisions that would offer creditors some flexibility and facilitatecompliance. Under the proposed rule, creditors would continue to be allowed to notifybusiness credit applicants of a credit decision orally or in writing. (Nonbusinesscredit applicants must be notified in writing when credit is denied orother adverse action is taken.) Notice of the credit decision would begiven in accordance with the timing requirements of andSection; 202.9(a)(1)of the regulation_typically within 30 days of receiving a ``completed''application. Under andSection; 202.2(f), an application is deemed to be ``completed''when the creditor has received all the information it regularly obtainsand considers in evaluating applications for credit (including any informationrequested from the applicant). If credit negotiations involve a seriesof countaroffers, the notice requirements of andSection; 202.9 of the regulationwould not be triggered by each counteroffer. <T3>See </T3>Regulation B, andSection; 202.9(a)(1)(iv) and the accompanyingofficial staff commentary. The Board proposes to allow creditors to satisfy the requirement of providinga written notice of the right to a statement of reasons for a credit denialin one of two ways. First, the creditor could give the notice to all businessapplicants at the time of application provided the notice is given in aform the applicant may retain. Notice could be given on a separate pieceof paper or included on any documentation provided to the applicant. Forexample, the notice could be printed on an application form or financialstatement. The disclosure should be noticeable, but there are no specialrequirements regarding location, type size, or type face. Alternatively, the creditor could follow the rule used for nonbusinesscredit and give notice of the right to a statement of reasons after a creditdenial or other adverse action is taken. And of course, as in the caseof nonbusiness credit, the creditor may provide the specific reasons fora credit denial, instead of merely giving notice of the right.Whether a notice is provided at the time of application or when adverseaction is taken, the notification must contain all the information requiredunder andSection; 202.9(a)(2) of Regulation B, except that_as noted above_creditorswould be permitted to give the statement of the action taken (for example,that a line of credit or a loan has been denied) orally or in writing.The information required includes the name and address of the creditor;a statement of the provisions of section 701(a) of the ECOA (the ``ECOAnotice''); and the name and address of the federal agency that administerscompliance with respect to the creditor. Appendix C to Regulation B contains sample notification forms. The Boardis proposing to add two notices_proposed forms C-7 and C-8_for use in connectionwith applications for business credit. Form C-7 is a sample notice of astatement of reasons for a credit denial. The reasons for a credit denialcontained in form C-7 are illustrative only. Form C-8 is a sample disclosureof the right to a statement of reasons of the type that would be givenat the time of application. A creditor may design its own notification forms or use all or a portionof the forms contained in the appendix. Proper use of the forms will satisfythe requirements of andSection; 202.9(a)(2)(i) and proposed andSection; 202.9(a)(3),respectively, for applications for business credit. Oral Notification for Telephone Applications An oral or written request for an extension of credit, if made in accordancewith procedures established by a creditor for the type of credit requested,is considered an application under andSection; 202.2(f) of Regulation B.The Board recognizes that creditors that accept telephone applicationsmight find it difficult to comply with the written notification requirements.Proposed andSection; 202.9(a)(3) of the regulation therefore provides thatwhen an application for business credit is made by telephone, compliancewith the notification requirements would be satisfied by an oral disclosureof the applicant's right to a statement of reasons for a denial of credit.In this instance, the additiona1 information otherwise required on a writtennotification need not be recited. For example, a creditor does not haveto give an oral disclosure of the ECOA notice specified in andSection; 202.9(b)(1)of the regulation. A request for an advance under an existing line of credit is not consideredan ``application'' for credit and therefore does not trigger the notificationrequirements of the regulation. <T3>See </T3>Regulation B, andSection; 202.2(f) and accompanying commentary;<T3>see also </T3>andSection; 202.2(c)(2). Inquiries from potential applicantsseeking only credit information also are not covered by the notificationrequirements. Such inquiries are, however, subject to andSection; 202.5(a)of Regulation B, which bars creditors from discouraging prospective applicants,on a prohibited basis, from making or pursuing an application. Retention of Records Used to Evaluate Applications Regulation B generally requires creditors to retain records for a 25-monthperiod that starts when the creditor notifies an applicant of the actiontaken on an application for credit. The purpose of record retention isto evidence compliance with or enforce any action under the ECOA by preservingrecords that may disclose patterns of lending policies or practices, tohelp support or refute allegations of discrimination. A 25-month periodwas established by the regulation because an aggrieved applicant has twoyears in which to file a lawsuit alleging violations of the ECOA.  The statutory amendments to the ECOA require that creditors retain recordson business credit applications for not less than one year, though theBoard has the discretion to set a longer period for record retention. TheBoard is proposing that records for applications involving businesses withgross revenues of $500,000 or less be retained for 25 months, the sametime period required for the retention of nonbusiness credit records. Asin the case of notification, the Board would like to provide as much uniformitybetween business and nonbusiness credit rules as possible. The Board believesthat doing so would facilitate creditor compliance by eliminating confusionthat might result from having different rules for business and nonbusinesscredit. The Board invites comment on whether requiring records to be retainedfor 25 months, instead of 12 months, would impose a significant incrementalburden. The rules governing record retention are contained in andSection; 202.12of Regulation B. Creditors are required to retain the original or a copyof any application document and other written or recorded data used inevaluating an application. (A ``copy'' includes carbon copies, photocopies,microfilm copies, copies produced by a computerized system, or copies producedby any other accurate retrieval system.) Typically, such data might includefinancial statements, tax returns, and business plans. The creditor mustalso retain a copy of any statement of reasons for a credit denial providedto an applicant. Any documents that are returned to the applicant uponthe applicant's request need not be retained.  Regulation B does not require creditors to use written application formsto satisfy the record retention requirements of the regulation. In situationswhere no formal written application is used, or where there is little documentationconcerning an application because a creditor is dealing with a customerof long standing or for some other reasons, the documentation necessaryfor record retention would be minimal. Where a creditor provides a notice of rights, a creditor may evidence compliancein various ways. The creditor need not retain acknowledged copies of theactual notice of rights given to each individual applicant. A creditorcould evidence compliance by having a sample copy of the type of noticeprovided to applicants and demonstrating that there are procedures in placeto ensure that notices are being provided. Notification and Record Retention Requirements for Applications by BusinessesWith Gross Revenues in Excess of $500,000, and Applications for Trade andSimilar Credit The proposed rules for notification and record retention discussed abovewould govern credit applications by businesses with gross revenues of $500,000or less. Credit applications by businesses with gross revenues exceeding$500,000, and applications for trade credit, credit incident to factoringand similar credit (regardless of the applicant's revenues) would be subjectto modified rules contained in andSection; 202.3(d) of Regulation B. (Tradecredit and credit extensions incident to factoring arrangements, typicallyinvolve the financing of inventory, equipment or accounts receivable. Someof these transactions may involve numerous oral, instant-credit decisionsmade on a daily, or even hourly, basis under the credit relationship, andthe legislative record indicates congressional intent that these transactionsshould not be subject to the new statutorily mandated provisions.)The Board is proposing certain revisions to the rules in andSection; 202.3(d)to simplify their application for both applicants and creditors, and tomake it easier for creditors to comply by providing more uniformity amongthe various timing requirements for notice and record retention. Underthe current regulation, a creditor must notify a business credit applicantof a credit denial, orally or in writing, within a reasonable time afterreceiving a completed application. (Notice provided in accordance withthe timing requirements of andSection; 202.9(a)(1) of Regulation B is deemed``reasonable'' in all instances.) The applicant currently has the rightto a written statement of the specific reasons for a credit denial, butmust submit a written request within 30 days of a denial in order to obtainthe reasons. Under the proposed revisions, applicants would have up to60 days after a denial (as in nonbusiness credit) to request written reasonsfor the denial. The current regulation requires creditors to retain records for 90 daysafter taking action on a business credit application. If during this timean applicant makes a written request to have records kept, the creditormust retain the records for 25 months. As in the case of the reasons fora credit denial, however, the creditor need not inform the applicant ofthe right to make the request. Under the proposed revisions to andSection;202.3(d), if the creditor receives a written request for a statement ofreasons, the creditor would be required both to give the reasons and alsoto retain records for a 25-month period. Thus, rejected applicants wouldnot need to make two distinct requests regarding the credit decision. Absenta request, a creditor would not have to retain records beyond the 60-dayperiod in which a request might be received. Elimination of Current Business Credit Exception Concerning Marital StatusInquiries The ECOA prohibits creditors from discriminating on the basis of maritalstatus in any aspect of a credit transaction. Section 202.5(d)(1) of RegulationB generally prohibits creditors from asking about marital status when anapplicant applies individually for unsecured credit. Currently, however,individuals applying for business credit may be asked about their maritalstatus whether the credit is to be secured or unsecured, under an exceptionprovided by andSection; 202.3(d)(2)(i). The Board proposes to eliminate that exception. As a result, inquiriesabout a business credit applicant's marital status would now be governedby the rules that apply to nonbusiness credit. Inquiries about maritalstatus would be permissible only if an applicant applies for secured credit,applies jointly for credit, resides in a community property state, or relieson property located in such a state as a basis for repaying a debt. See<T3>generally </T3>Regulation B, andSection; 202.5(d)(1) and accompanyingcommentary. Elimination of Exception Regarding Reporting Credit Information to ThirdParties The Board proposes to delete from andSection; 202.3(d) the exception fromandSection; 202.10, the regulatory provision that governs the reporting ofcredit histories on joint accounts held by spouses. Under andSection; 202.10,a creditor that furnishes credit information to third parties (for example,to a credit bureau or another creditor) must reflect the participationof both spouses on any account held jointly by married persons, even ifone spouse is merely an authorized user on the account. This provisionis intended to ensure that married women are able to develop credit historiesin their own names so that in the event of widowhood or divorce, for example,they are not left without a credit history. The Board believes this provisionhas no applicability in the context of business credit accounts becauseany credit history reported about such an account pertains to the businessentity and not to the individuals owning the business. The Board thereforebelieves that providing an exception from this provision is unnecessary,and proposes to eliminate the exception. Exceptions for Nonbusiness Credit The ECOA amendments of 1988 were enacted to modify the business creditexceptions, and no specific mention is made in the legislative record ofother nonbusiness credit transactions. The modifications relating to theBoard's rulewriting authority, however, also affect the other existingexceptions in andSection; 202.3 (a)-(c) and (e) of Regulation B_for public-utilitiescredit, securities credit, incidental credit and credit to governmentalagencies. Like the exceptions for business credit, the exceptions for thesetypes of transactions will be subject to review every five years. The exceptionsexist primarily because the extensions of credit to which they relate generallyare incidental to some other service being provided, or because they aresubject to regulation by another governmental entity. The nonbusiness exceptionshave been republished in this notice. The Board invites specific commenton the appropriateness of retaining these exceptions. <ITAG tagnum="84">(3) Comments Requested </ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposedamendments and other matters addressed in this notice.
