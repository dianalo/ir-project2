Kohlberg Kravis late Tuesday offered to pay $64 a share in cashand securities for each of Kroger's 78.6 million outstandingshares, an indicated total of $5.03 billion, and repeated itsrequest to meet with the Kroger board.   The amount of the latest proposal topped not only the buyoutfirm's previous offer of $58.50 a share, or about $4.6 billion, butalso the proposed $4.6 billion restructuring plan that Kroger'sboard of directors approved last month to thwart any outsidetakeover.   Furthermore, Kohlberg Kravis indicated that if Kroger decided togo through with the restructuring, the firm was willing to buy thesurviving company _ and it hinted Kohlberg also might be willing totake its offer directly to Kroger shareholders.   ``We have come forth with what we believe is an exceptionaloffer for your company's shareholders and we are confident that, ifgiven the opportunity, your shareholders would embrace it,''Kohlberg Kravis said in a letter to the board of Cincinnati-basedKroger.   Kohlberg Kravis announced its sweetened offer after the close ofstock trading Tuesday in New York. Kroger shares dipped 87{ centsto $55.37{ a share in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.   ``The Kroger Company's management, legal and financial advisersare reviewing the second unsolicited proposal from KKR,'' PaulBernish, a spokesman for Kroger, said late Tuesday. He said thecompany had no further comment.   Kroger has been resisting overtures from Kohlberg Kravis and theHaft family of Maryland, which had offered $4.32 billion, or $55 ashare, for Kroger.   Kohlberg Kravis specializes in leveraged buyouts _ purchasesmade with mostly borrowed money that is repaid with funds from thetarget company's operations or the sale of its assets.   The firm rarely has engaged in an outright hostile takeover,partly because the success of its deals often depends on havingexisting management remain with the target company.   But as its coffers have bulged with money from investors anxiousto participate in buyouts _ Kohlberg Kravis has an estimated $5.6billion warchest that can be used as equity to leverage about seventimes that amount _ pressure has mounted for the firm to be moreaggressive in creating deals.   Kohlberg Kravis' sweetened offer includes $50 in cash, $11 indebt securities and $3 in stock of the new company that KohlbergKravis would create from Kroger. The investment firm's earlieroffer contained the same cash portion of $50 but only $8.50 insecurities.   Kroger's restructuring announced Sept. 13 would pay stockholdersa special dividend of $40 a share in cash, securities valued at $8plus stock in the surviving company, valued at $5 to $10 a share.   Kohlberg Kravis said that if Kroger undertook the plan, Kohlbergwould be willing to acquire the stock in the restructured companyfor $13.50 a share _ $10 in cash and $3.50 a share in debentures.As such, Kroger stockholders would realize a total of $61.50 ashare in cash and securities from both parties.   The investment firm noted the alternative, post-retructuringbuyout would be for $2.50 a share less than its up-front offer, andsaid the difference reflected its estimates of financing feesKroger would have to pay under the restructuring plan, plusKohlberg's added costs in financing Kroger debt incurred in therestructuring.   Kroger's restructuring also includes layoffs and the sale ofoperations, in order to streamline the company and cut costs.
