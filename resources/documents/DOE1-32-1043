The high-risk investment over the past few years by the US Departmentof Energy in geopressured, hot dry rock, and magma energy resources isproducing new means to lower production costs and to take advantage ofthese resources. The Nation has far larger and more regionally extensivegeothermal resources than heretofore realized. At the end of a short30-day closed-loop flow test, the manmade hot dry rock reservoir at FentonHill, New Mexico, was producing 10 MW thermal - and still climbing -proving the technical feasibility of this new technology. The scientificfeasibility of magma energy extraction has been demonstrated, and newfield tests to evaluate this technology are planned. Analysis and fieldtests confirm the viability of geopressured-geothermal energy and theprospect that many dry-hole or depleted petroleum wells can be turnedinto producing geopressured-geothermal wells. Technological advancesachieved through hot dry rock, magma, geopressured, and other geothermalresearch are making these resources and conventional hydrothermal resourcesmore competitive. Noteworthy among these technological advances are techniquesin computer simulation of geothermal reservoirs, new means for well stimulation,new high-temperature logging tools and packers, new hard-rock penetrationtechniques, and new methods for mapping fracture flow paths across largeunderground areas in reservoirs. In addition, many of these same technologicaladvances can be applied by the petroleum industry to help lower productioncosts in domestic oil and gas fields. 5 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
