Later, she opposed a ban on firearms at the University ofMassachusetts. And in one way or another since then, MacNutt hasbeen fighting for the right to bear arms.   Her latest battle is against a proposed Boston ban onsemiautomatic weapons.   For MacNutt, a lawyer, the fight is more than an abstract cause_ she owns and uses semiautomatic rifles, including an M-1A rifleand an SKS carbine.   ``I basically use guns for three reasons,'' she says. ``I usethem for protection, I use them for target shooting and I also do alittle bit of collecting.''   A bill to ban the weapons in Boston been approved by the stateHouse and the Senate is scheduled to take up the legislationMonday. In its present form, the bill would require owners ofassault weapons to get special permits from the police commissionerto keep them and would all but ban any new military-style guns inthe city.   The legislation _ a so-called home rule petition which isproposed by the city but which must be approved by the Legislature_ would outlaw specific types of semiautomatic rifles by model. Italso would create a board that could add weapons to the banned list.   A lifelong gun enthusiast, MacNutt says the measure wouldunfairly punish those who have legally and responsibly owned gunsfor years.   MacNutt belongs to the National Rifle Association and also is onthe board of directors of the Gun Owners' Action League, astatewide group leading the legislative charge against the proposedban.   Her experience with guns dates back to childhood, when anantique gun was part of family folklore.   The revolver belonged to her great-grandfather, a ship's captainin the late 1800s. According to family stories, he used the gun toquell a mutiny aboard his leaky ship. Some crew members wanted toabandon the ship for lifeboats, but MacNutt's grandfather kept thempumping water instead.   ``He saved his crew and saved his cargo and it was a good thinghe was able to keep control,'' MacNutt said.   Her parents encouraged MacNutt and her siblings to ask questionsabout the gun and handle it under their guidance.   ``Firearm safety was impressed upon us at an early age,'' shesaid. ``There was never any mystique about it. There was never anyforbidden fruit.''   MacNutt got her first gun as a Christmas present at age 13. Shestill has the .22-caliber bolt action rifle.   ``I had wanted it and wanted it. When I was 13, they figured Iwas old enough,'' she says.   Today, she owns several semiautomatic weapons, including theM-1A rifle, a version of the M-14 rifle refitted for civilian use,and the SKS Simonov carbine, a semiautomatic weapon with a fixedmagazine that holds up to 10 rounds.   Those who favor the ban question the value of such weapons forsport shooting. They say the guns only pose a danger to people.   MacNutt disagrees.   ``They're not the type of gun that I think anybody in theirright mind would carry into a holdup because they're large, they'reheavy,'' she said.   MacNutt argues that people who own guns legally don't misusethem. People who own guns illegally cause the problems, she said,and they aren't going to be stopped by legislation to furtherregulate gun use.   MacNutt lives with her mother in the Dorchester section ofBoston, an area beset by drug-related violence. She has never hadto use a gun in self-defense, but says feels safe because she canhandle firearms.   Fascinated by gun history, MacNutt gives a mini-discourse on theevolution of modern firearms with little prompting.   Beginning in her college days, MacNutt has worked hard tointegrate women into the sport. She belongs to a number of clubs,and she shoots competitively on weekends during the warm months.   There is nothing alarming or exotic about the sport, she said,adding: ``It's much like a bowling club.''</TEXT></DOC>
