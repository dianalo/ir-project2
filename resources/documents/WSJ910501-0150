The decision came in a dispute over profitsthat Century received from the sale and leaseback of a powerplant.   It is unclear what effect the judge's recommendation,which is being forwarded to the commission for a finaldecision, may have on Tucson Electric, which for months hasteetered on the brink of bankruptcy. Yesterday, the companyannounced a first-quarter loss of $51.5 million, or $2.09 ashare, on revenue of $120 million. That compares with a lossin the year-earlier period of $14.7 million, or 68 cents ashare, on revenue of $109 million.</LP><TEXT>   Tucson-based Century Power argued that such a rulingagainst Century would force the utility into bankruptcy andcause it major financial loss. But Judge David I. Harfeldagreed with Arizona regulators in ruling that &quot;Century hasonly itself to blame if it does become insolvent.&quot; CenturyPower controller Jane Gabroy declined to comment and referredcalls to the company's lawyer, who wasn't reachable.   The Arizona Corporation Commission, which filed the caseagainst Century Power, says that if the FERC accepts thejudge's recommendation, Century could be liable to paybetween $60 million and $80 million to Tucson Electric.   Paul Bullis, chief counsel for the commission, noted thatsuch a payment might prove to be a mixed blessing. TucsonElectric has about $100 million in liabilities outstandingwith Century and thus would be hurt if Century is forced intobankruptcy-law proceedings. Mr. Bullis said a final decisionis expected in about a year.   Originally, Century Power was owned by Tucson Electric,but was spun off in 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
