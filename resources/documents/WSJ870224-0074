The group, led by Columbia Ventures Inc., said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it offered to pay $19 a share for the 18.7 million Harnischfeger shares it doesn't already own. The transaction would have a total value of more than $356 million.    Columbia Ventures, based in Miami, Fla., said it proposed the acquisition in a letter sent to directors of Harnischfeger last week. The letter said the proposal is subject to a definitive agreement acceptable to Harnischfeger.    Officials of Harnischfeger weren't immediately available for comment.    Harnischfeger shares closed yesterday at $17.75, up 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    The Columbia group disclosed its existing stake in Harnischfeger last October. At that time, it said it might take steps to influence management or seek control of the company.    In the letter to directors of the Milwaukee company, the Columbia group said it would plan to retain Harnischfeger's existing management and to run the company according to the current plans of management. The letter added that the group believes it has prompt access to financing.    Although it wasn't clear how Harnischfeger might respond to the proposal, analysts speculated that the Columbia group's offer might be intended to smoke out other bids for the Milwaukee company. The Columbia group acquired its existing shares at prices between $14.50 and $18.50 a share, according to a previous SEC filing.    Laurans Mendelson, chairman of Columbia Ventures, said his group had made other bids for publicly traded companies, but hasn't yet made an acquisition. He wouldn't elaborate on plans for Harnischfeger, beyond statements made in the SEC documents. &quot;We like the company and its business and what they are doing,&quot; he said.    In the SEC filing, the Columbia group said that if Harnischfeger turns down its proposal it plans to &quot;continue to explore the feasibility of, and strategies for, seeking control.&quot; It added that it may continue to acquire more Harnischfeger shares.    The Columbia group said that to further its proposal and to retain management of Harnischfeger it &quot;would be willing to provide financial incentives adequate to accomplish such continuity of management.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
