Chief Says </HL><SO> </SO><CO> AFRIC FORGN </CO><IN> PET MON </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Africa is facing huge debts, lagging food production and a soaring infant-mortality rate despite broad economic and social reforms, according to United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.    The U.N. chief, speaking at the opening of a two-week review of the U.N. Africa Recovery Program, gave a grim prognosis for the continent. Among the signs of distress, he said:   --Infant and child mortality rates are rising, and are projected to reach 50 million in the 1985-2000 period. In every other world region, infant and child mortality is rapidly decreasing.    --By the year 2010, the continent's debt will be more than 280% of its total export income.    --Per-capita income on the continent fell 2% in 1986 and 2.2% in 1987, and today is lower than it was in 1980.    --Agricultural production improved by 3.8% in 1986 but only 1.1% in 1987, despite agricultural policy reforms.    Mr. Perez de Cuellar's report marks the midway point of the 1986-1990 Africa Recovery Program, the result of a special General Assembly session in May 1986, the first session to focus on one continent.    The program was aimed at helping reverse Africa's economic decline, but external problems have blocked substantial progress, Mr. Perez de Cuellar said. Three key problems are the continent's depressed export earnings, the cost of repaying its debt and insufficient financing.    &quot;Every day that passes, the debt burden of African countries becomes even more excruciating,&quot; said Adebayo Adedeji, U.N. undersecretary general.    Although Africa paid almost $1 billion a year to the International Monetary Fund in loan costs in 1986 and 1987, resources fell, exports credit declined and loans from the private sector were minor, Mr. Perez de Cuellar said.    Africa's debt burden &quot;has become one of the most important factors constraining recovery and development on the continent, and unless urgent action is taken, the situation will worsen,&quot; he said.    The U.N. Economic Commission for Africa estimates the continent's total external debt at $218 billion by the end of 1987, almost triple its export earnings.    A slump in commodity prices has further hurt Africa's economy. Sluggish markets for oil, minerals, cocoa, coffee, and tea are particularly damaging.    These problems largely canceled out any gain that might have been produced by the &quot;courageous and commendable&quot; sacrifices of some African nations, such as adopting steep currency devaluations, cutting budget deficits and turning over some public sector functions to the private sector. &quot;In many countries such measures involve social costs and political risks,&quot; Mr. Perez de Cuellar said.    Most African nations have embarked on economic restructuring programs, about 30% of them with the backing of the IMF and World Bank.    &quot;Most countries are giving greater priority to channeling resources to agriculture, to improving incentives for farmers, to making provision for food security and to combating drought and desertification,&quot; the U.N. chief said.    Mr. Perez de Cuellar urged African nations to continue these restructuring programs, but cautioned them to ensure that &quot;the most vulnerable groups in society are protected from adverse consequences.&quot;    Saying donor countries should show their support for these reforms by increasing their aid, Mr. Perez de Cuellar also called on industrialized nations to reduce their agricultural subsidies on products competing with African commodities.    &quot;African efforts to pursue and deepen the reform process cannot be sustained indefinitely in the face of an adverse external environment and without increased support from the international community,&quot; the secretary-general said. </TEXT></DOC>
