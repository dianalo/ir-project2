Significantly different estimates ofnitrogen fixed can be obtained with different reference crops. In orderto evaluate a suitable reference crop for the determination of symbioticallyfixed nitrogen by common beans (phaseolus vulgaris), a glasshouse wasconducted at Seibersdrof, Austria on the soils from two sites-Seibersdrofand Au. Three reference crops viz. buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) uninoculatedcommon beans. Results showed that there was no significant differencein estimates of nitrogen fixation in respect to buckwheat and sorghum.Both of these crops had the same percent nitrogen derived from fertilizerand total N content within the limits of significance. Estimates on nitrogen/sub/2fixation in respect to uninoculated common beans were smaller and thisreference has the same total N content as the inoculated test crop. Itspercentage NdfF was much lower than the other two reference crops showingsome substitution from atmosphere.</TEXT></DOC>
