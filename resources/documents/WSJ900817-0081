The retailing and financial services concern is understoodto be targeting administrative staff members at itsheadquarters here as well as employees who performnon-selling duties at its 850 U.S. stores. An individualfamiliar with the plan said Sears hasn't determined yetexactly how many of its 337,000 U.S. merchandising employeeswill be fired.</LP><TEXT>   But the individual said Sears expects the job cuts toresult in annual savings of more than $100 million.   And that's apparently just the beginning as ChairmanEdward A. Brennan seeks to turn around the company'sfaltering retailing business. In a management shakeup lastweek, Mr. Brennan reassumed day-to-day control of the $31billion-a-year merchandise group and vowed to cut costs.   A Sears spokesman said only that &quot;Mr. Brennan is lookingat all opportunities to enhance revenues, improve margins andreduce costs in all areas. This review is ongoing and nofinal decisions have been made.&quot;   Sears executives are now understood to agree privatelywith analysts that it must reduce expenses by at least $500million annually to become competitive. That's because,despite years of trimming costs, Sears's operating expensesare still among the highest in retailing. Last year, thoseexpenses consumed 30 cents of every Sears retail salesdollar, compared with 23 cents at K mart Corp. and 16 centsat Wal-Mart Stores Inc.   &quot;More than ever, they're questioning the way they didthings -- all the safety nets,&quot; said another individualfamiliar with the situation. Sears &quot;has a business systemthat is more complicated than it has to be.&quot;   The first step involves cutting corporate overhead bycombining the company's corporate and merchandise groupheadquarters staffs. By year end, the company expects toeliminate overlapping jobs in such departments as personnel,finance and planning, including some jobs at the officerlevel, according to an individual familiar with the plan. The600-member corporate staff previously oversaw both the coremerchandise group and Sears's financial service operations.These include its Allstate insurance, Dean Witter brokerageand Coldwell Banker real estate units.   Sears also intends to eliminate thousands of non-sellingjobs at its stores, mostly in 1991. Workers who perform suchduties as receiving and stocking merchandise and staffingcustomer service and personnel offices now account for asmany as a third of a store's employees, the individual said.At most department stores and other mass-merchandisingchains, non-selling employees make up less than 20% of astore's work force.   Sears officials believe relying more on automation willreduce the number of non-selling employees. The approach wasrecommended by an outside consultant, the Garr Associatesunit of Deloitte andamp; Touche, hired by Sears late last year.Some of Sears's competitors such as crosstown rivalMontgomery Ward andamp; Co. already are trimming their costs withsuch a system.   People familiar with the situation, in fact, say Searsbroke off merger talks with Montgomery Ward because Searsexecutives concluded they could cut costs on their own. Asreported earlier, Montgomery Ward's chief executive officer,Bernard Brennan, approached Sears two months ago aboutmerging Ward into Sears, but he wanted to run the whole show.The two Brennans are brothers.   Sears executives are understood to have recognized thatBernard Brennan could have taken an ax to costs as he has atWard. But that would have been an admission of failure ontheir part. Sears executives also are understood to have beentroubled by Ward's flat sales over the past several months.   The talks nevertheless forced Sears executives torecognize that their company desperately needs to become moreefficient -- and fast. Ward had &quot;at least a three-year headstart&quot; in areas such as reducing non-selling expenses in itsstores, one of the individuals said.   Sears stock closed yesterday at $29.875, off 75 cents, inNew York Stock Exchange composite trading.</TEXT></DOC>
