But 16 other Westerners remained captive, among them nineAmericans. And late in the year President Reagan acknowledged thatthe United States, too, may have to deal.   ``We're looking at every channel that we can find to try and getthem (hostages), and I imagine that the ultimate is going to have tobe somehow a negotiation with Iran, because they have control of(the kidnappers),'' the U.S. chief executive told a news conference.   Political and military developments in the region brightened theoutlook for the release of remaining hostages, most of whom arebelieved held by Lebanese Shiite Moslem groups under the influenceof Iran.   Iran's acceptance of a cease-fire in its 8-year-old war withIraq, Iranian moves to improve diplomatic relations with the West,and Syria's moves to curb pro-Iranian Shiites in Lebanon _ allcombined to alter the backdrop to the long-running hostage drama.   Both France and West Germany successfully negotiated with theTehran government over the past two years to free all 13 French andWest German hostages in Lebanon.   Among those released in 1988 were Frenchmen Michel Carton, MichelFontaine and Jean-Paul Kauffmann, and West German Rudolf Cordes.   The French government denied it made any deals. But informedsources in Paris said France agreed to restore diplomatic relationsand repay $400 million to Iran, final segment of a $1 billion loanmade by the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The sources also said$10 million, channeled through an Iranian businessman, was paid totwo terrorist factions in Lebanon.   The West Germans, who have good contacts with Tehran, also deniedthey made any deals.   But informed Arab sources said millions of dollars were paid intoSwiss bank accounts, sanctioned either by the Bonn government or themajor firms employing two of the German captives, to secure themen's release.   Iranian leaders said several times recently that Tehran would useits influence with the kidnappers in Lebanon to free their Americancaptives if Washington released Iranian assets worth several billiondollars, assets frozen in 1979.   Until his Dec. 8 news conference, Reagan had publicly rejectedany linkage between the hostages and Iranian assets, and dismissedthe notion of negotiation.   The longest-held of the nine Americans is Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press, kidnapped March16, 1985.   The other hostage Americans are educators Thomas Sutherland,Frank Herbert Reed, Robert Polhill, Alann Steen and Jesse JonathanTurner, university comptroller Joseph James Cicippio, writer EdwardAustin Tracy and Marine Lt.
