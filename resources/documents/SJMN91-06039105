Story,&quot; SteveMartin's anxious-to-please variation, are as different as sleet and smog,kosher franks and takeout tacos, subways and freeways . . . and, well, asdifferent as New York and Los Angeles.;    L.A. -- or rather the chi-chiBeverly Hills eateries and Hollywood neighborhoods Martin passes off as L.A.-- is as trendy and frivolous as New York is stern and unforgiving. It's aplace of health fads, movie stars, happy-talk radio and pink-stuccomonstrosities.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Weekend  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PARADISE ON THE PACIFIC COAST'L.A. STORY' OF LIFE AND ROMANTIC LOVE IS,DEEP DOWN, TRULY SHALLOW  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     New York is a formidable target for satire; La La Land, dopey andtouchy-feely, is its own best spoof.;    Which may be why Allen's portraitshave tension and texture, while Martin's nervously limned carbon is gaseousand giddy -- a succession of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skits reaching forsignificance.;    It doesn't help that Martin -- who wrote, executive-producedand stars in this comedy-romance -- has nothing new to say about the City ofthe Angels. In his -- and director Mick Jackson's -- hands, the place is againrendered as a series of pastel sunsets, grid-locked freeways and over-analyzedrelationships.;    Martin's rush-hour shoot-outs and tours of the L.A. CountyMuseum? Obviously inspired by the anarchic Jules Feiffer and, again, Allen.The flying hotdog stand behind the opening credits? A playful reference toFellini's airborne Christ at the beginning of &quot;La Dolce Vita.&quot;;    Elsewhere,Martin defers to Will Shakespeare, whose mangled text becomes the last word onlove lost and regained in the fast lane.;    Martin has cast himself as a&quot;Wacky Weekend Weatherman&quot; for a local TV station, who falls in love with anewly arrived British journalist, played by Martin's wife, Victoria Tennant.;   Little befalls Martin's Harris K. Telemacher, and even the crises -- loss ofa job, the infidelity of a longtime girlfriend -- don't seem very important.;   Tennant's Sara is an airhead version of Diane Keaton's Annie Hall. Keaton'sHall was flaky and bright; Sara is just exasperatingly flaky, given to drivingvery fast on the wrong side of the street, like every stereotypical Britabroad.;    Harris and Sara, of course, spar briefly, fall hopelessly in loveand then run off to a Santa Monica hideaway -- with different partners. Harrisweekends with a Santa Monica love child into colonic therapy; Sara motors offwith her ex-husband, a pleasantly oblivious sort who's also from England.;   Sarah Jessica Parker (TV's &quot;Equal Justice&quot;) and Richard E. Grant (&quot;Withnail andamp;I&quot;) have fun with these stock types. Marilu Henner looks trapped anduncomfortable playing Harris' self-obsessed girlfriend.;    Look for ChevyChase and Rick Moranis in contrived cameos. Moranis is a Cockney gravediggerwho helps Harris impress his new love with an updated version of Hamlet's&quot;Alas, poor Yorick&quot; speech.;    Martin's most inventive bits include a BeverlyHills brunch (where everything from decaf coffee to earthquakes is lampooned),a nightmare about the world's toughest dinner reservations and an electronicfreeway sign that acts as our hero's spiritual guide. The latter device addsan amusing mystical element, not unlike that now found in Allen's &quot;Alice.&quot;;   Overall, Martin's latest feels as schizoid and undisciplined as the charactersit skewers. The script is at once precious, fuzzy-headed and unaccountablycrude; director Jackson's visual style (which makes extensive use oftime-lapse photography and trompe l'oeil shots) is as arty as Godfrey Reggio's&quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot; tone poem.;    None of this should come as a surprise. &quot;L.A.Story&quot; is the kind of laid-back fairy tale that results when a wild-and-crazyguy consults someone else's muse -- a someone named Woody in this instance.; L.A.
