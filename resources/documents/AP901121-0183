He told reporters at U.N. headquarters in Geneva the talks wereon how to go about achieving a political solution and left him``very much satisfied.''   ``A cornerstone has been laid for opening talks and dialogue andfor advancing the process as well as the implementation of thepeace process,'' he said. ``No doubt it will bear fruit.''   Najibullah then left for Bern, the Swiss capital, where hescheduled a meeting with parliamentarians. One deputy, GillesPetitpierre, said plans for an Afghanistan peace conference inSwitzerland was a likely topic.   Najibullah would identify the resistance leaders only as``prominent personalities of the opposition side'' and did not saywhen they met. He declined comment when asked if they included PirSayed Ahmed Gailani, leader of the National Islamic Front inAfghanistan.   Gailani leads the most moderate faction in the alliance of sevenanti-government groups. Rumors in Islamaba, Pakistan, said he wasin Geneva.   Marxists seized power in Afghanistan in 1978. In December 1979,one Marxist government succeeded another in a coup and invited inmore than 100,000 Soviet troops. An insurrection by Moslemguerrillas, known as mujahedeen, began soon afterward andcontinues, although the Soviets completed withdrawal of theirtroops in February 1989.   Najibullah said conditions for a political solution werefavorable. He said his government had embarked on a democraticcourse providing for a free press, party pluralism and a moreWestern-like structure of government.   He said a growing understanding between the United States andthe Soviet Union could contribute to the peace process.   He singled out Pakistan as being chiefly responsible for thecontinued Afghan civil war and accused Pakistan of preventingAfghan refugees from returning home.   Nearly 3 million Afghans fled to adjoining Pakistan over thepast decade, and Afghan guerrilla operations have been based there.   Najibullah said he hoped the new Pakistan leadership wouldembark on a ``sound course.''   ``If they move one step forward we will move 10 steps,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
