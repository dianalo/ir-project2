FU</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cambodian resistance leader Prince NorodomSihanouk said today he will take part in peace talks withVietnamese officials next month but expressed doubt about Hanoi'splanned withdrawal of troops from Cambodia.   ``I'm in favor of dialogue. I am not Mr. Nyet. I am Mr. Da. I'mnot going to say no to anybody,'' Sihanouk said at Beijing'sairport.   He left today for Bangkok to attend a meeting of the foreignministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), aprincipal backer of the three-party anti-Vietnam coalition thatSihanouk heads. He is also likely to meet Secretary of State GeorgeShultz, who will be in Bangkok for the conference.   Sihanouk said he will ``say always `yes' to all proposals'' thatwould lead to a settlement of the Cambodian conflict and calledplans for informal peace talks to be held next month in Jakarta a``good thing.''   Vietnam has said it will also attend the ``cocktail party''talks in Jakarta.   ``I am interested in solving the problem of Kampuchea so with orwithout the Vietnamese in Jakarta I'm going to attend,'' he said.``The composition of the participants has no importance.''   The ``cocktail party'' would bring together for the first timethe rival factions of the three-party resistance, representativesfrom Vietnam and from the Hanoi-installed Cambodian government.   Sihanouk also said he was willing to meet with Cambodian PrimeMinister Hun Sen. He broke off talks with Hun Sen in Paris earlierthis year, accusing him of being a puppet of the Vietnamese.   ``I will talk to the Vietnamese, to Hun Sen, to everybody,''Sihanouk said. ``The most important thing is to start the processof examining the problem and trying to exchange views and havingdiscussion.''   The resistance coalition, made up of Sihanouk, the CommunistKhmer Rouge and the non-Communist forces of Son Sann, is callingfor the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops that have occupied Cambodiasince late 1978. The group also wants the formation of a four-partygovernment that would include Hun Sen.   Vietnam has said that it will pull out 50,000 troops this yearand the remainder of its estimated force of 120,000 by 1990, butSihanouk said he feared the troops would only be rotated.   ``I don't believe it is true,'' he said. ``That must be rather arotation of troops rather than a genuine withdrawal. The Vietnamesecannot afford to withdraw ... because the Hun Sen regime wouldcollapse.''   Vietnam's pullout, which is to begin this month, has renewedconcern about the return of the Communist Khmer Rouge, which killeda million or more people before being ousted by Hanoi.   Sihanouk denied Western news reports that China had offered togive asylum to Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot in an attempt to helpsolve the Cambodian conflict.   China on Thursday called the reports ``highly irresponsible''and ``absolutely groundless.''</TEXT></DOC>
