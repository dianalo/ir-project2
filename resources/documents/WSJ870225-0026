Several top Wall Street executives and securities lawyers, in testimony before the Banking Committee's subcommittee on securities, endorsed the idea of speedier disclosure of acquisitions. They also called for a major expansion of the SEC's staff and its technological ability to oversee its growing regulatory domain.    At the first congressional hearing since officials at two prestigious investment houses were implicated in the widening insider-trading scandal, several witnesses described the SEC as understaffed and underfunded. The agency, they said, is unable to recruit and retain the legal talent and computer expertise it needs.    Former SEC Commissioner James Treadway told the senators that the insider scandal reflects a lack of respect for the agency and &quot;a feeling that it is spread too thin.&quot;    For fiscal 1988, which begins Oct. 1, the SEC has requested a 27% increase from its current budget of $115 million. But Harvey Pitt, a former SEC general counsel who now represents arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky, expressed concern that the agency &quot;is seeking too little, too late.&quot;    Alvin Shoemaker, chairman of First Boston Corp., said he would support doubling the current SEC budget, and his counterparts at three other firms said they favor expanding the agency's staffing at a manageable rate.    Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the securities panel, asked Mr. Pitt to organize a panel of securities lawyers and SEC officials to draft a statutory definition of insider trading. Mr. Pitt agreed to report back within 90 days.    Mr. Pitt chided the Reagan-appointed commission for its &quot;timidity&quot; in rule-making and its reluctance to ask Congress to address legal &quot;anomalies.&quot; Instead, he said, the SEC has relied on case-by-case litigation to establish its &quot;misappropriation&quot; theory, which holds that it's illegal to trade on stolen inside information. As a result, current insider-trading law is confusing, &quot;somewhat tortured and of dubious validity,&quot; he contended.    Mr. Pitt said that the agency has opposed any statutory definition for fear that it would be too narrowly drawn, allowing certain miscreants to go free. But he advocated rewriting the law to clarify the misappropriation theory and define the concept of insiders.    The four securities-firm executives yesterday all declined to offer a definition, saying it would depend on the circumstances. &quot;It looks to me,&quot; said Sen. William Armstrong (R., Colo.), &quot;that your industry is in a spot where the (definition) is a lot more subjective than I'd like if I were in your shoes.&quot;    There appeared to be broad support among the witnesses and lawmakers for shortening the 10-day period in which investors must report stock holdings of 5% or more to the SEC. Donald Marron, chairman of PaineWebber Group Inc., recommended reducing it to two days. He also suggested requiring corporate officers, directors and major holders to report within two days their personal transactions in the stock of the company they are involved with, rather than within 10 days after the end of the month in which the transactions occurred.    &quot;It's the light of day that will take away the opportunity for insider trading,&quot; Mr. Shoemaker said.    Both Mr. Pitt and Milton Cohen, a Chicago lawyer and former SEC staff member, called for a comprehensive study of the securities markets, particularly developments in the takeover area.    Mr. Cohen criticized the SEC for what he called excessive reliance on the marketplace to correct takeover abuses. He also recommended reexamining takeover rules, which he said seem to encourage &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; tactics of speed and surprise. In the early 1960s, Mr. Cohen directed a special study of the markets in the wake of stock-manipulation scandals.    Mr. Pitt also urged overhauling the tender-offer process. &quot;The commission's failure to respond to unconventional tender offers, creeping acquisitions, untimely Schedule 13D filings, open-market acquisition programs, greenmail and the like have left the securities markets volatile and inflamed,&quot; he said.    Messrs. Pitt and Treadway suggested several measures to expand or clarify the SEC's authority. Both endorsed empowering the agency to issue cease-and-desist orders against violators.    The two men also expressed alarm over apparent shortcomings in the SEC's review of corporate disclosure documents and other filings. Only 17% of the annual reports and only 20% of the proxy statements were scrutinized last year, Mr. Treadway said, and those percentages are projected to drop further this year and next. In contrast, Mr. Pitt said, every filing was reviewed in 1975. </TEXT></DOC>
