Fairview Construction, which lost a contract to build a policestation due to the requirement, has challenged the constitutionalityof the plan based on the Supreme Court's ruling last month thatstruck down a similar ``set aside'' program in Richmond, Va.   Suffolk Superior Court Judge Albert Tuttle on Monday allowedlawyers for Fairview to amend their previously filed lawsuit toinclude the constitutional question on the minority issue. But cityattorneys said they will try to get the affirmative action issuedismissed.   Tuttle set another pre-trial hearing for March 7.   ``There are very similar things in Boston's program to what theSupreme Court held unconstitutional in the Richmond decision,'' saidFairview attorney Edward J. Quinlan before Monday's hearing.   Attorneys for the city argued that the Fairview contract wasrejected because of a bidding irregularity and did not hinge on theminority requirements. But the lawsuit's amendment did appear toopen the door to the constitutional question, said Al Wallis, cityassistant corporation counsel.   ``It seems to be that that issue is in the case. How it getsresolved in the case remains to be seen,'' Wallis said.   In Richmond, minority firms were guaranteed 30 percent of citycontracts. In Boston, the requirement is 15 percent, except in areasdetermined to have a high percentage of minorities, where therequirement is 30 percent.   Justice Sandra Day O`Connor, writing for the majority in the Jan.23 decision, said construction set-asides can be enacted only withspecific proof that there has been past race discrimination in theconstruction industry and if there is no other ``race-neutral''remedy.   Tuttle's decision will be confined to Massachusetts, but the casehas national implications as cities wait to see how the SupremeCourt ruling will be interpreted, attorneys said.   Thirty-six states and nearly 200 local governments have programsthat set quotas, goals or require good faith efforts to enlistminority participation, said Benna Solomon, an attorney whorepresents the National Governors Association, the U.S. Conferenceof Mayors and five other organizations.   The significance of the Massachusetts case is that it comes sosoon after the high court's ruling, Solomon said.   ``Whenever you have a major ruling like the Supreme Courtdecision in the Richmond case it does not answer all of thequestions,'' Solomon said. ``That is why that process of evaluationof the decision by other courts in the context of reviewing otherplans is so important.''   Boston officials say they believe their program will hold up.   The legal challenge stemmed from a dispute dating back to lastfall when Fairview came in with the low bid to building the policestation, but lost the contract after Sciaba Construction Co. ofBoston protested that sections of the Fairview bid did not meet thecity's minority business rules.   Fairview filed suit in December 1988, charging they should nothave been denied the contract, which involves about $2.5 million,Wallis said.   Last week, Fairview filed a motion asking that their case includethe claim that the Boston plan is unconstitutional.   ``(The amendment) is a last ditch effort to try to get thiscontract by Fairview,'' said Sciaba attorney John Spignesi.   City Councillor Bruce Bolling, author of the ordinance, said hebelieves the plan would meet the Supreme Court test because it wasbased on the findings of a public hearing into discrimination in theconstruction business.</TEXT></DOC>
