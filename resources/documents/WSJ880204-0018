Simon Graduate School of Business Administration said it plans to establish a business school in Australia.    The school would be the first American business school to establish an Australian campus. It plans to open the school in 1991 after raising $36 million for teachers' salaries and other expenses.    The Simon school said it received a gift of 50 acres of land outside Sydney to build the school and a pledge by its Australian patron, Lady Warwick Fairfax, to raise $20 million Australian dollars ($14.3 million) to build classrooms.    The Simon School was renamed in 1986 after Mr. Simon, the entrepreneur and former Treasury secretary, gave the school $15 million. Mr. Simon, who does business in Australia, brought the university together with Lady Warwick. &quot;We like to call him our broker,&quot; a university spokeswoman said. </TEXT></DOC>
