Even so, the sale of the Great Plains coal gasification plantnear Beulah, N.D., will still yield more than the government couldexpect by operating it over the next 21 years, said analysts fromthe General Accounting Office.   In a report dated Oct. 21 and received Tuesday, GAO analysts saidthe Energy Department should not count about $300 million in taxcredits that the prospective buyer, Basin Electric PowerCooperative, has agreed to forgo.   Bob Porter, an Energy Department spokesman, said the departmenthad not seen the GAO report but as a general matter believes it islegitimate to count the value of the tax credits that will not beused.   ``That's cash the government would not have had; that's quitelegitimate,'' Porter said.   Using figures to calculate the loss of future income from thesale of the plant's gas at prices forecast by the Energy Department,GAO calculated the sale as yielding the equivalent of $203 millionto the government.   That is midway between the respective $284 million and $128million figures that two consultants, Wharton Econometrics and DataResources Inc., calculated using their forecasts of future energyprices.   The value to the government of the future revenues undergovernment ownership would be $166 million using departmentprojections, $230 million using Data Resources' estimates and a lossof $54 million using Wharton's estimates, GAO said.   The plant cost $2.1 billion to build and was a technical successat turning lignite into pipeline-quality gas. Its builders, though,defaulted on $1.5 billion in government guaranteed loans, leavingthe Energy Department to pay off the loans and take over the plant.</TEXT></DOC>
