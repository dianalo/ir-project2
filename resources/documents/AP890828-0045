SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Relatives warned Jose EnriqueMenendez that criminals prey on the rich. But he kept the gatesunlocked at his $4 million Beverly Hills house, with its tenniscourt and Mercedes-Benz outside.   And that could have made it easy for mobsters to get him, hissister said outside a memorial for the slain Hollywood executive.   ``We think he made the mistake of buying a business that had beenused before by the Mafia, and we think he was trying to run itstraight,'' Marta Menendez-Cano of West Palm Beach, Fla., saidFriday.   Her brother, Jose E. Menendez, was found shot to death the nightof Aug. 20 along with his 44-year-old wife, Kitty, in theirSpanish-style mansion.   About all police would say was that nothing had been ruled out.   The Cuban-born Menendez, 45, once headed RCA-Ariola Records aswell as the U.S. rental car operations for the Hertz Corp.   He was chief executive officer and chairman of the board of LiveEntertainment Inc., an affiliate of Carolco Pictures Inc. in thevideo and music distribution business, and had been praised forimproving the company's performance.   Two of the three companies operated by Live Entertainment hadbeen linked to organized crime before Live Entertainment boughtthem. Live Entertainment acting President Roger R. Smith hasvehemently rejected suggestions that the deaths may have a mob link.   Ms. Menendez-Cano and former Lt. Gov. Mike Curb, a friend fornearly a decade, described Menendez as absolutely honest, althoughan extremely aggressive businessman.   ``Sometimes he had to tell people things they didn't want tohear,'' Curb said. ``But he was a wonderful guy, an absolutelyoutstanding person. I just can't believe something like this couldhappen.''   Curb and Ms. Menendez-Cano spoke outside the memorial service atthe Directors Guild of America in Hollywood, where 400 peoplelistened to eulogies by the Menendezes sons, Eric, 18, and Lyle, 22.   Ms. Menendez-Cano said her brother had tried to keep the videobusiness clean.   ``The first thing he did was to get rid of the porno business,''she said. ``Because of his success, he probably was stepping on manyshoes, which some people didn't like.''   International Video Entertainment, which Live Entertainmentpurchased in 1986, had been owned by Noel C. Bloom. Bloom wasidentified in a California attorney general's report on organizedcrime that year as a major distributor of X-rated movies and aformer associate of the late Michael Zaffarano of the Bonannoorganized-crime family.   Peter Hoffman, Carolco's president and chief executive, saidInternational Video Entertainment itself was never involved inpornography.   The other company with a crime-linked past was BeckZack Corp.,which owns the 81-store Strawberries audio and home-video retailingchain in the Northeast. Live Entertainment completed its acquisitionof BeckZack this June.   BeckZack's principal shareholder, Morris Levy, was convicted inMay 1988 of conspiring to extort payments from a record wholesaler.He remains free pending an appeal of his conviction.   An FBI affidavit filed in federal court in New York in connectionwith an investigation of Levy quoted an unidentified informant assaying that a faction of the Genovese crime family owned an interestin the Strawberries chain. The documents called Levy ``a lucrativesource of cash and property'' for Genovese leaders.   Andrew Nichols, the Boston lawyer who represented Levy in thesale of Strawberries to Live Entertainment for about $40.5 million,said he is certain the company had no crime connections at the timeof the sale.   And Live Entertainment officials said they even checked withfederal organized crime investigators, who said they were unaware ofany such links to Strawberries.   Ms. Menendez-Cano said her brother had big plans to expand. ``Hesaid he would be controlling the East Coast video business, throughhis careful planning, in the next couple of years.''   She said her brother refused to listen when she warned him aboutleaving the house unlocked.   ``We told him that there were burglars, criminals in theneighborhood,'' she said.   Menendez and his wife had been looking to the future, building an8,000-square-foot dream house above Los Angeles.   Then their sons found their bullet-riddled bodies.   Menendez would want his business associates and friends to keepup the fight, his younger son told the mourners.   Eric Menendez recalled how his father kept a portrait of theslain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in the house, andadopted as his motto King's declaration of hope _ ``I have a dream.''</TEXT></DOC>
