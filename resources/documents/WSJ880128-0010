It has no limiting effect at all on the powers of the states. Indeed, the amendment was, in Judge Kennedy's words, 'a recognition of state independence and . . . of the role of the states in defining human rights.'&quot;    Mr. Markman writes as if the Civil War amendments had no effect whatsoever upon how the Constitution is to be construed. Yet the 14th Amendment declares that no state shall &quot;deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.&quot; It may then become necessary to ask: What is included in that liberty, of which a state may not deprive any person? In asking that question, one may also properly ask: What are those unenumerated rights, of which the Ninth Amendment speaks, which are retained by the people, and which may not be denied or disparaged? One can hardly ignore the fact that before the Civil War, the states, or some of them, in defining human rights, had sanctioned human slavery.    Harry V. Jaffa   Claremont, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
