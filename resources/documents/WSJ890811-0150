The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.14 to 463.55 on moderately heavy volume of 134.4 million shares. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones 1,062-922.    Yet traders said sellers dominated the action. &quot;I saw some old-fashioned profit-taking,&quot; said Robert O'Toole Sr., manager of institutional OTC trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton.    The weakness in many OTC stocks surprised some traders who expected the OTC market to rise in sympathy with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which briefly surpassed its record closing level of 2722.42 before retreating. For the day, the Dow was up almost 1%.    The selling pressure on the OTC market was such that &quot;you wouldn't think {the Dow Jones Industrial Average} was going for a record,&quot; said Mr. O'Toole.    Financial stocks, which soared as speculation continued that the economy will avoid a recession and that interest rates are headed lower, rescued the OTC market from a decline. Bank and thrift earnings tend to improve when interest rates fall. The Nasdaq Financial Index rose 3.66 to 461.71.    One of the OTC market's glamour stocks, Liz Caiborne, lost 3/4 to 24 3/4 on one million shares. Traders blamed profit-taking for the decline. Analysts who follow the stock said there was no corporate news or any shifts in the fundamentals of the company to account for the stock's weakness.    Much of the selling was in the technology sector, which continued its intense love-hate relationship with investors. Only three days ago, investors and securities firms re-embraced the group they have rebuffed for months because of disappointing earnings news. Now many investors, who feel betrayed as the earnings surprises resume, are turning their backs on the stocks again. Yesterday, investors reacted to disappointing news from Computer Associates on the New York Stock Exchange and Novell on Nasdaq.    Novell fell 3 7/8 to 25 on 2.8 million shares. The maker of computer-networking products said it expects to report net income for its third quarter, ended July 29, was slightly lower than the $11.5 million, or 35 cents a share, it posted for the second quarter of fiscal 1989. The results are likely to be well below current analyst estimates, which range from 37 cents to 49 cents a share. The third-quarter results are expected to be released Sept. 11.    Novell said that although shipments of software products increased modestly, the company's previously announced strategy of shifting out of its non-strategic hardware business was the primary reason for the decline during the quarter. The company said the benefits of its actions to reduce operating expenses, including workforce reductions, won't be realized until the fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in October.    The news was a blow to analysts and investors, coming on the heels of an announcement from Novell's chief rival, 3Com, that it might post a loss for its fiscal 1990 first quarter, ending this month. Some analysts, anticipating the bad news from 3Com, have been advising investors to sell their 3Com shares and buy Novell, which they believed had a brighter outlook.    Other technology stocks that suffered included Apple Computer, down 3/4 to 43 1/4, and Sun Microsystems, off 5/8 to 14 1/2. Intel eased 1/4 to 31 1/4 and Seagate Technology lost 5/8 to 11 7/8.    Len Hefter, head of Jefferies andamp; Co.'s OTC trading desk in Dallas, said many technology-stock investors are frustrated. &quot;People are starting to feel that enough is enough and that now isn't the right time to be involved in this sector,&quot; he said. &quot;The {outlook for the} whole sector is tentative at best and there probably are more surprises on the downside on the horizon.&quot;    Some technology stocks did rise, however.    Shares of three laser manufacturers mentioned in an article in this newspaper earlier this week posted huge gains in OTC trading. Summit Technology rose 1 1/16 to 7 3/16 bid, Visx jumped 2 7/8 to 9 7/8 bid and Taunton Technologies soared 5 3/4 to 18 1/2 bid. The article said the three companies are racing to market a version of a highly specialized laser used in corneal sculpturing to correct vision defects.    Among other active stocks, Wheelabrator Group added 1/4 to 9 3/4 on 2.6 million shares. First Executive gained 1/4 to 13 and MCI Communications improved 1/2 to 37 1/2. </TEXT></DOC>
