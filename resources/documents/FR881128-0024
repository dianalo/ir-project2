This is the second of a seriesof 3 rulemakings implementing the authority in FOGRMA that provides forinspection of Federally supervised oil and gas leases by other than Federalemployees. The first, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 17, 1987 (52 FR 27180), set forth generalprovisions pertaining to delegations of authority, cooperative agreements,and contracts, and the particular regulations governing delegations ofauthority. It has been the policy of the Department of the Interior toimplement section 205 of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Actfirst and then to follow with the implementation of sections 202 and 301.This proposed rulemaking would provide procedures for cooperative agreementsunder section 202 of the Act. It therefore covers cooperative agreementsbetween the Bureau of Land Management and States and Indian tribes.  The purpose of the inspection program is to determine whether there iscompliance on oil and gas leases with the requirements of the mineral leasinglaws and the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act.  Section 202 of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act authorizesthe Secretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements withStates and Indian tribes for the purpose of sharing oil and gas royaltymanagement information, and carrying out inspection, investigation, andcertain enforcement activities, including those activities authorized bysection 108 of the Act. The Secretary may not enter into cooperative agreementswith a State involving Indian lands without permission of the affectedIndian tribe.  In considering this proposed rulemaking, States and tribes should be awarethat the continuation of any cooperative agreement made under any regulationspromulgated as a result of this rulemaking process will be conditionedupon the availability of the funds for compensation to an entity participatingin the program.  The proposed rulemaking would also add a new andSection; 3190.4 providingthat the Bureau of Land Management will make available information neededby States or Indian tribes to carry out activities authorized by cooperativeagreements, contracts, or delegations of authority provided for in thispart.  The principal author of this proposed rulemaking is Susan Pepperney ofthe Division of Fluid Mineral Lease and Reservoir Management, assistedby the staff of the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management,Bureau of Land Management.  It is hereby determined that this proposed rulemaking does not constitutea major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to section 102(2)(C)of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C))is required.  The Department of the Interior has determined that this document is nota major rule under Executive Order 12291 and will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>).  The information collection requirements contained in Subpart 3192 havebeen approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501and assigned clearance number 0348-0006.  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 43 CFR Part 3190  </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Government contracts, Indian lands_mineralresources, Intergovernmental relations, Mineral royalties, Oil and gasproduction, Public lands_mineral resources, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.
