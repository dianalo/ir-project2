The schemeinvolved about 10 clients and almost 10 finance companies,according to Japanese news wire reports. The total of fakeddeposits could have run as high as 60 billion yen, thereports said, with 25 billion yen of that in a branch incentral Tokyo.   Kyowa Saitama Bank said Friday that a former branchmanager falsified bank records to help two financiallytroubled clients secure loans worth billions of yen.   The manager, 41-year-old Kazuo Toyama, allegedly drew upphony deposit receipts early this year totaling eight billionyen for two Tokyo-based companies, a real-estate concern andan auto-sales and golf-course development company, accordingto Ryota Iwai, Kyowa Saitama's deputy president. Thecompanies allegedly used the fake receipts to secure loansfrom four nonbank finance companies.   Bank officials said the scheme was discovered in April,after an in-house investigation of the transactions. Theinspection was prompted when the borrowers missed paymentsand the lenders contacted Kyowa Saitama seeking thecollateral.   The scandal emerged Thursday when Fuji Bank Ltd. firedfour employees after it charged that they created 260 billionyen in false deposit receipts for clients to use ascollateral in obtaining loans from nonbank finance companies.Fuji Bank faces the loss of 27.1 billion yen as a result ofthe transactions.   Kyowa Saitama said it has filed a complaint with the Tokyoprosecutors' office against Mr. Toyama and the owners of thetwo companies.   Kyowa Saitama was formed by the merger in April of KyowaBank Ltd. and Saitama Bank Ltd. About the time of the merger,Mr. Toyama, a former Saitama Bank employee, quit to form hisown business. Bank officials say Mr. Toyama has admitted toforging the deposit receipts and has been firedretroactively.   Kyowa Saitama officials say they haven't assessed thefinancial impact on the bank of Mr. Toyama's falsetransactions. The bank is in talks with the finance companiesand has yet to determine the extent to which the bank mightmake good their losses.</TEXT></DOC>
