Jack Murtha to bring the Base Closure program in line with the law's original intention: saving the taxpayers' money. The Murtha Amendment simply provided that no base would be closed if it did not provide savings to the taxpayers within six years.    The Base Closure Commission simply failed to do any homework on the Presidio. For one thing, the land cannot be sold. By current law, it must be transferred to the Interior Department if the military leaves. There were other costs that the commission did not see, but the General Accounting Office did. It found that the pay-back to the taxpayers by closing the Presidio wouldn't even begin until the year 2011, if the base closed next year.    Also, if the Presidio has &quot;no military mission,&quot; as your editorial states, then why is the Army asking for $150 million to move the Sixth Army headquarters to perform the same function in Colorado?    You will find no stronger opponent of wasteful military spending than I, and that is why I oppose closing the Presidio because it will cost the taxpayers millions of dollars. Keeping the military mission at the Presidio does not &quot;scuttle the base-closing act.&quot; Far from it. It preserves the integrity of the law by saving money. That's common sense.    Rep. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.)    Washington </TEXT></DOC>
