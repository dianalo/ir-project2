That will allow earlier treatment to reduce severity of thedisease, a hereditary disorder that afflicts at least 100,000Americans, authorities said.   Doctors also will be able to rule out the disease early, bringingrelief to a family.   ``It's going to usher in a new era in us being able to provideservices of various types for people with this disorder,'' saidAllan Rubenstein, medical director of the National NeurofibromatosisFoundation.   The disease, called neurofibromatosis 1, strikes in about one inevery 4,000 live births.   The illness causes tumors to grow anywhere in the nervous systemand can lead to severe disfigurement, deafness, blindness, braincancer and spinal deformity. Some 40 percent to 60 percent ofpatients also suffer learning disabilities.   The disease gained its nickname from a disfigured 19th-centuryEnglishman who exhibited himself at sideshows as the Elephant Man.But since then, researchers have determined he actually had adifferent disease.   Early signs of the disease often are noticed shortly after birth.But in about a quarter of all cases, a diagnosis cannot be confirmeduntil adolescence, when other symptoms appear, said Rubenstein.   In addition, he said, about 10 percent of neurofibromatosis caseslack classic symptoms, so that no definite diagnosis can be made.That poses a problem as a person approaches childbearing years andwants to know if he or she carries the faulty gene, which can bepassed on to a child, Rubenstein said.   While prenatal diagnosis allows the possibility of an abortion,most people with neurofibromatosis live a normal life withoutserious medical problems, said John Carey, associate professor ofpediatrics at the University of Utah.   About half of neurofibromatosis cases come from inheriting thefaulty gene, while the other half occur spontaneously. Testing basedon the new discovery will be possible only in families in which thedisease has already appeared.   Researchers followed up on a 1987 discovery that the gene causingthe disorder lay somewhere within a portion of chromosome 17, one ofthe 23 versions of thread-like structures that carry humanhereditary information.   The new work narrows down the location of the gene to about 5percent of the chromosome. The genetic signposts, called markers,lie close to the gene on each side.   The markers are valuable because they tend to be inherited alongwith the gene. So if they are found on a person's chromosome 17, hehas a high probability of carrying the neurofibromatosis gene.   The markers will be useful in an estimated 80 percent to 90percent of families that have had a case of neurofibromatosis,Rubenstein said. In those families, the markers should enable earlydiagnosis with at least 95 percent accuracy, he said.   Once the gene itself is isolated, a more general screening testwill be possible, researchers say.   The findings are reported in the January issue of The AmericanJournal of Human Genetics by a consortium of researchers, led byFrancis Collins of the University of Michigan, Bernd Seizinger ofHarvard Medical School and Bruce Ponder of Royal Marsden Hospital inEngland.</TEXT></DOC>
