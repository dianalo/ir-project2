Electricity exports benefit Canadian sellers and U.S.purchasers as well the Canadian economy in general. There is a clearconsensus that these benefits exist and should be realized, but the evidenceindicates that there is no consensus on how the benefits can best bedistributed within Canada. The divergent views expressed by interestedparties from across Canada clearly demonstrate the complexity associatedwith determining the overall Canadian interest and that there is a needfor a balancing of these interests by a federal body. The regulationof electricity exports is clearly a matter of international commerceand Ontario Hydro submitted that the Constitution Act deems the provinceincompetent to regulate the export of electricity from Canada. OntarioHydro submitted that a federal body is required in the regulation ofelectricity exports to protect the broader Canadian interest.</TEXT></DOC>
