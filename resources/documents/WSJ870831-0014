JamesStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/31/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> PHARMACEUTICALS, HOSPITAL SUPPLIES, MANAGEMENT (PHA)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS) </IN><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a major victory for chiropractors, a federal judge ruled that the American Medical Association and two other medical groups violated U.S. antitrust laws by encouraging a boycott of those practitioners in an attempt to eliminate their profession.    The decision in the 11-year-old case was hailed by chiropractors, who say that because of the boycott, they have been denied hospital privileges, referrals from medical doctors and, in some areas, eligibility for payments from health insurers. It was unclear, however, whether the ruling would have any immediate impact on the practice of medicine in the U.S.    The court's decision wasn't a ruling on the advantages of chiropractic care versus conventional medicine, but rather a finding that organized medicine through its actions had in effect stifled competition from chiropractors.    Chiropractors treat disease on the theory that it is caused by faulty nerve function. They use manipulation, or adjustment, of body joints, especially of the spine, to restore normal nerve function. They hold degrees in chiropractic medicine.    In a 101-page opinion, Judge Susan Getzendanner of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois said that from the mid-1960s to 1980, the AMA and certain other groups orchestrated a campaign to inform their members that chiropractors were &quot;unscientific and that it was unethical for a medical physician to associate with a chiropractor.&quot;    That campaign resulted in an &quot;unreasonable restraint of trade,&quot; the judge said. Thus, she said, the four chiropractors who originally filed the lawsuit in 1976 were entitled to a court order that would prevent future anticompetitive behavior by the AMA and other defendants. No monetary damages were awarded.    The other defendants found to be part of the conspiracy were the American College of Surgeons and the American College of Radiologists.    Dismissed from the suit were the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals, the American College of Physicians and the American College of Orthopedic Surgeons.    The 30,000 U.S. chiropractors represent the second-largest group of primary-care doctors in the U.S. Medical doctors are the biggest, with more than 550,000 physicians.    Medical doctors and the AMA have long disputed the validity of chiropractic care, especially in earlier decades when some chiropractic theories and practices seemed scientifically groundless to the medical establishment. More recently, however, chiropractors have leaned increasingly on the scientific method, thereby removing some of the cause of objections from the medical community.    George McAndrews, a lawyer for the chiropractors, said &quot;I'm hopeful this will open the eyes of Congress and state legislatures that the AMA is not a charitable group but a trade union for physicians and moves forcefully to protect its members' rights and financial standing.&quot; The plaintiff chiropractors were Chester A. Wilk, of Park Ridge, Ill.; Patricia B. Arthur, Dayton, Ohio; James W. Bryden, Sedalia, Mo., and Michael D. Pedigo, San Leandro, Calif.    Kirk Johnson, the AMA's general counsel, said, &quot;We think the decision is wrong,&quot; and called examples of wrongdoing cited by the judge &quot;ancient history.&quot; He said the AMA will study the opinion before deciding on an appeal, the same position taken by the two other defendants, the colleges of radiology and surgery. </TEXT></DOC>
