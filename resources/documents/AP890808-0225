The American Petroleum Institute's weekly statistics on oilstocks were due out after the close of trading.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediatecrude for delivery in Septemer rose 21 cents to close at $18.12.WTI, the benchmark grade of light U.S. crude, fell 12 cents onMonday in another quiet session.   Contracts for delivery later in the year also showed gains butclosed below $18 a barrel.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasolinefor September rose 0.69 cent to finish at 50.44 a gallon, whileSeptember heating oil gained 0.12 cent to a settlement price of48.56 cents a gallon.   Except for a few upward blips, crude prices have been fallingsince late July. The September contract has lost 42 cents sinceJuly 25, when it traded at $18.54.   Analysts said the latest gains came on expectations that lastweek's hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico would reduce some of theinventories that have been building lately. Sluggish demand andexcess production by the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries have increased the supplies of crude and gasoline instorage.   ``People were buying ahead of the APIs,'' said John Hill, energybroker for Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``Because of the hurricanelast week people think there will be a drawdown in inventories.''   The storm forced the shutdown of some refineries, delaying theproduction of gasoline and other refined products.   Despite the advance, some traders said the underlying weaknessin the market remains and prices could fall further.   ``We expect prices to continue on a downtrend,'' said RandallRothenberg, trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It might not betomorrow or the next day but we expect the market to go down beforeit comes out of this doldrum.''</TEXT></DOC>
