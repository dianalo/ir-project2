Company managers allegedly drove the cars as far as 400 miles over periods ranging from a few days to five weeks.    &quot;What a black eye,&quot; exclaims one public-relations official at a Fortune 500 company. Says another: &quot;I'm shocked. I would cop a plea if I were the P.R. guy there.&quot;    Chrysler's immediate response to the 16-count indictment against its Chrysler Motor Corp. unit, handed up by a federal grand jury in St. Louis, was a denial that &quot;the company or any of its employees had done anything illegal or improper.&quot; It didn't dispute that it had been disengaging odometers during a test program, but it said the aim was to avoid reducing the warranty protection of customers.    Nevertheless, many of the people who make protecting a corporate image their job believe that, at the least, the charges create a strong impression that Chrysler deliberately tried to mislead customers. And they believe that correcting that impression will be a difficult challenge for the company, which was accused of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, wire fraud and odometer fraud, and faces a maximum fine of $120 million.    In the wake of the odometer scandal, some of these specialists were asked how they would feel, and what they would do, if they were in their counterparts' shoes at Chrysler. Here is some of their advice:    PRACTICE HUMILITY   Len Kessler, president of LMK Communications Inc. in New York, argues that the incident should have been a &quot;one-day story,&quot; but that Chrysler officials may have helped to make it into a bigger issue by denying they did anything wrong.    &quot;In most cases where it's something that involves stupidity as much as greed -- or a judgmental error -- it's almost always better fessing up and admitting you made a mistake,&quot; says Mr. Kessler, a 33-year public-relations veteran. &quot;Whatever they do now, I think they're operating on the defensive. . . . Their reaction was such that it fanned the fires.&quot;    Mr. Kessler adds that Chrysler might also be the victim of too much success in recent years: &quot;They walk on water and float two feet off the ground. The (tire) treads have never been worn.&quot;    TRY HONESTY   Walt Mulhall, a Chicago public-relations consultant, offers: &quot;They could have put a note in the glove compartment, along with a speeding ticket, saying, 'We have tested this car hard enough to know it can exceed the limit.'&quot; (The Chrysler practice came to light because some of its executives told police that they didn't know they were speeding because they were driving cars with disconnected odometers.)    Although he believes Chrysler is right to defend its testing program, he says the company shouldn't try to justify the practice of disconnecting the odometers.    ACT PRESIDENTIALLY   Jody Powell, the former presidential press secretary and now with Ogilvy andamp; Mather, says Chrysler's problem is more one of image than of substance. But, he notes, that could be particularly damaging to Chrysler. Mr. Iacocca's strength, he says, &quot;has been his tough, no-nonsense, look-you-square-in-the-eyes approach. The real danger here is that this has potential for damaging that image, and in the eyes of most consumers you can't separate Chrysler from Iacocca.&quot;    So, Mr. Powell suggests, Chrysler's chief needs to take the offensive: &quot;He's got to get on top of it without a lot of excuse making or excessive explaining and nitpicking. (Chrysler) has someone who can stand up there and say, 'This may be a problem of appearances, but appearances are important to me, and there ain't going to be no more of this.'&quot;    Mr. Powell warns, though, that Mr. Iacocca shouldn't turn it into a confession. &quot;If it's a case of an extra 20 miles or so, he doesn't have to go overboard.&quot;    TRUST IN LEE   Put Lee Iacocca on television, advises Tim Croasdaile, vice president, corporate relations, for Bell andamp; Howell Co. He suggests Mr. Iacocca tell the American public that he's &quot;damn mad and that it won't happen again.&quot; Mr. Croasdaile says the Chrysler chairman is credible and feisty enough to win back consumer trust.    The other option is to hide, he says, adding that such crisis situations remind him of an old P.R. joke. &quot;If you get a call from Mike Wallace asking for Tim Croasdaile, you say: 'I'm sorry, he's not here. I just heard his phone ringing as I walked by.'&quot; But, he notes, &quot;I've never done it myself.&quot;    SAY YOU'RE SORRY   &quot;This is not unlike the baker sticking his finger in the dough and taking a little bite out of the cake before it is cooked,&quot; says Redmond Tyler, a public-relations executive at NWA Inc., which owns Northwest Airlines. &quot;The first thing I'd do is admit that we did it. The second thing I would do is apologize for having done it, because it would be in violation of our corporate policy to do anything that is misleading. The next thing I would say was that we considered it not an ethical matter but a technical matter.    &quot;You've got a company with a tremendous amount of corporate integrity. I'd have Iacocca make a statement, because he's believable next under God, that it's not our style, that it was merely a technical matter, the way we move the product. I then would suggest we come up with some method of apology in the form of a coupon or gesture.&quot;    THAT'S THE TICKET   Frank Mankiewicz of Hill andamp; Knowlton, has two suggestions. First, he says, &quot;you put out a press release saying that this proves that Lee Iacocca is not running for president but for the chairman of the National Security Council.&quot;    Second, he says, Chrysler ought to hire Joe Isuzu, the character in the Isuzu car ads who touts his truthfulness. He might claim: &quot;These cars have only been driven by little old company executives from Pasadena,&quot; says Mr. Mankiewicz.    Chrysler, concludes this public-relations veteran, &quot;has a problem.&quot;    BE SERIOUS   &quot;The thing you don't ever want to do is get involved in a situation where you become a laughingstock,&quot; says Andrew Yemma, public-relations director of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and owner of two Chryslers. Unfortunately for the auto maker, he says, &quot;there's going to be a lot of jokes about this.&quot;    He says the best thing for the company to do is to announce formally that it is halting the practice. He adds that the company should say that any of its cars that are tested extensively in the future will be sold as demonstrators.    SEEK SYMPATHY   &quot;If I was public-relations counsel to Chrysler, I'd advise them to do the opposite of stonewall,&quot; says Theodore H. Pincus, chairman of the Financial Relations Board, a financial public-relations agency. &quot;I'd tell them the thing that breeds credibility these days is vulnerability.    &quot;I'd also recommend not looking at this as wholly a negative. I'd attack the idea that you have to be the first behind the wheel for it to be a new car. That's a misconception. I'd tell a client to fight back, they can't persecute us for testing our product to make sure it works right. So what if a corporate vice president drives it around a little. It's still going to smell new and look new, and a reputable dealer will clean it up and it will be new.    &quot;Nobody's going to care if a company's making sure for its customers that the quality of its product is tiptop.&quot;    But what about turning back the odometers? &quot;Well, that's a little more difficult. You say this was a policy of conscious concealment and it will be stopped immediately. Then you tell everyone everything they want to know. If you hide things, it'll blow up in your face. If you tell all, nobody will remember the whole thing in a week.&quot;    BLUFF IT   &quot;Their best bet,&quot; says William Curry, director of news services for Virginia Power, &quot;is to turn it into an ad campaign and tell people: 'Nobody tests cars the way we test cars.' And hope no one adds, 'Thank God.'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
