A-6 aircraft.    The so-called A-6F is one of a group of big weapons projects that the military services plan to scuttle as the Pentagon attempts to squeeze $33 billion from its proposed budget for fiscal 1989, which starts next Oct. 1.    Other casualties of the budget squeeze include the Air Force's Midgetman nuclear missile, for which a number of prospective contractors are vying; the Penguin anti-ship missile, produced by the Norwegian state-controlled company Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk; the Lockheed Corp. AC-130 gunship aircraft; and the AGM-130, an improved version of the GBU-15, a glide bomb produced by Rockwell International Corp.    The spate of proposed cancellations will be reviewed by Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and eventually by the White House. The cuts, which stem from the recent budget compromise worked out by the White House and Congress, represent the first deep cutbacks in the defense program that the Reagan administration mapped out seven years ago. Until now, budget reductions have been absorbed by cutting money from hundreds of programs, but terminating virtually none.    &quot;This is a meltdown,&quot; said an Air Force budget planner. The budget cuts go well beyond fiscal 1989, with military planners working to reduce a five-year budget plan by about $250 billion. Indeed, the services are reversing the trends of the military buildup with plans to shrink overall force levels.    The Air Force has decided to deactivate three of its 38 tactical fighter wings after concluding that the current budget will support only 35 wings, each of which consists of 72 fighter aircraft. The Reagan administration originally called for 40 tactical fighter wings.    The change translates into fewer purchases of General Dynamics Corp. F-16s and McDonnell Douglas Corp. F-15s, the two main fighter planes in the fleet. The Air Force plans to buy 180 F-16s in fiscal 1989, consistent with an existing contract. After that, the Air Force would acquire only 120 a year. Yearly purchases of F-15s would drop from 42 to 36 in fiscal 1989, and after that to 30.    The Air Force also plans to chop its purchases of Maverick missiles, produced by the Hughes Aircraft unit of General Motors Corp., and Amraam missiles (for Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile), which are produced by Hughes and Raytheon Co.    The Air Force also plans to cut about 21,000 military personnel from its current force of 603,000.    The Navy is shrinking also. Congress has moved to mothball the USS Midway, a World War II-era aircraft carrier currently operating in the North Arabian sea. The action delays until the late 1990s the administration's goal of keeping 15 carrier battle groups.    Other ships are being cut also. Rather than seek funding for two Aegis cruisers in fiscal 1989, the Navy will ask for money to begin work on only one. The Aegis ships are built by Ingalls Shipbuilding division of Litton Industries Inc. and Bath Iron Works.    The cancellations, assuming they're approved, deprive contractors of lucrative defense jobs they had counted on, but they won't necessarily force the companies to close down current production lines. Grumman, for example, expects to continue building current versions of the A-6 aircraft, even though the A-6F won't likely be ordered. General Electric Co., which had planned to supply F-404 engines for the A-6F, will continue to build them for F-18 planes.    Similarly, Lockheed expects to make other versions of the AC-130. </TEXT></DOC>
