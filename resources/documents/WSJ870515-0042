Overhead, a squadron of small planes wheel and swoop in heart-stopping aerobatics.    Amid the confusion, commercial fisherman Bruce Joyce twists the battered wheel of the Scandia, jockeying in the swells to keep his boat from crunching onto a rocky point just 25 feet away. Mr. Joyce swivels his attention between the threatening rocks and a flickering electronic fish scanner. Blips on the screen show what is triggering such a melee of boats and planes: huge schools of herring gliding beneath the boat's keel.    When it comes to fish tales, Sitka's frenzied spring herring run is a whopper. Experts rank this run as the world's richest in terms of fish caught -- and money earned -- in the shortest time. Last year, boats netted as much as $500,000 each in a fishing &quot;season&quot; lasting just three hours, 10 minutes. Tons of fish and big profits are again on the line, with demand for the fish bolstered by the Japanese, who customarily devour herring roe on New Year's Day in the belief that it enhances fertility.    &quot;If fishing had a Super Bowl, this would be it,&quot; declares Robert Haltner, a boat captain from Petersburg, Alaska.    The state of Alaska tightly regulates the catch to protect the spawning herring from overexploitation. It restricts fishing to a small area and limits the number of fishing permits to 52, the last having been issued in 1978. Last winter, Mr. Haltner turned down a $285,000 offer for his permit -- cash proffered in a suitcase, he says, &quot;for tax reasons&quot; -- and he could get more than $300,000 for it today.    Under such circumstances, things sometimes get out of hand. Boat captains, competing fiercely for the biggest haul in the prescribed time, pay pilots as much as $30,000 a day to go up as herring spotters. They hire scuba divers to leap into the frigid sea to unsnarl nets. They have been known to rent bystanders' boats for $100,000 on the spot when their fishing gear malfunctions.    But for the Japanese, there wouldn't be any such fishing frenzy for the lowly herring. Most herring are ground into fertilizer, while some are dried, smoked or salted for delicatessens and fish markets. In Japan, however, many believe that herring roe improves fertility. On New Year's Day, celebrators gobble tons of delicate finger-sized sacs of roe,    The Japanese fished their own waters for herring untilabout 15 years ago when the little fish abruptly disappeared.&quot;Overfishing, pollution, who knows why?&quot; shrugs ShinjiHayashi, a Japanese fish buyer here for the herring run.Demand for Sitka's herring suddenly took off as the Japanesebegan scouring the North Pacific for new sources of supply.They eat some herring after the roe has been removed and sellthe rest to others.   Robert DeJong, a baby-faced, 38-year-old biologist for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, supervises the herring catch. The agency bases the annual tonnage limit on calculations of the herring population. Each year, Mr. DeJong sets the boundaries of the fishing area. This year's area is an area of four square miles just north of Sitka's harbor. Mr. DeJong also decides exactly when the season starts and stops.    It is a dicey job. Because herring spawn so swiftly, a miscalculation of only a few hours can cost the fishermen millions of dollars. If Mr. DeJong starts the season too soon, before the pale yellow eggs ripen into the robust orange so highly prized by the Japanese, the price will plummet. If he waits too long, the fish may &quot;spawn out,&quot; leaving southeastern Alaska's coastline strewn with tiny herring eggs and the season in ruins.    Mr. DeJong says his predecessor burned out under the pressure of the job seven years ago. While he hasn't yet called a &quot;spawn&quot; wrong, he admits, &quot;I don't sleep real well these days.&quot;    As spawning time approaches, Sitka's picturesque harbor is jammed with hundreds of fishing boats, backup tenders, seaplanes and fish-processing ships. Fishing crews come from up and down the West Coast and as far away as Hawaii. The four-story Sheffield Hotel, normally shuttered until summer, opens to accommodate the influx.    &quot;This is the big bang of the year,&quot; says Helen Flanery, bartender at the Pioneer Bar, a waterfront dive whose walls are lined with photos of fishing boats.    Mr. DeJong has been up before dawn each day, scouting the shoreline for signs of spawning -- usually, ribbons of cream-colored milt, or sperm, discoloring the sea.    At a crowded meeting of fishermen a few days earlier, he reported that sample fish catches showed far more males than females, which indicates that the roe percentage -- and profits -- could be poor. The men groaned. The spotter pilots caucused, meanwhile, trying to figure out how to squeeze more than 30 planes into the airspace over the fishing area. Everyone had a near-collision story from last year, when it snowed. Everyone agreed this year won't be any safer.    After more than a week of knuckle-biting, Mr. DeJong calls the spawn on March 31. &quot;Major spawning&quot; has begun, he tells the reconvened fishermen. The season will open in three hours, at noon. &quot;If we hold off any longer,&quot; he warns, &quot;we're not going to get anything.&quot; Fishermen are already sprinting for their boats.    Mr. Joyce, 47 years old, is on the flying bridge of the Scandia, following directions radioed in code by his spotter overhead and eavesdropping on terse coded messages between rival captains and spotters. Mr. Joyce's spotter reports dark plumes of herring, close to shore. He guns the 56-foot Scandia toward a cove full of fish. Mr. DeJong cuts through the radio babble to count down the final seconds before the start of fishing.    As the countdown ends, pandemonium erupts. The Scandia and seven other boats race into the same cove. Each crew frantically strings out a massive net off the stern as the boat tries to encircle a school of amorous fish. But nets tangle. Boats lurch against each other. Some crews shake fists at one another, while skippers snarl over the radio.    The Scandia, trying to avoid another boat, snags its net on a rock. Mr. Joyce, a lean 6-foot-5 man, flings his cap on the deck in disgust as the crew glumly hauls in the empty seine. &quot;Big-time screw up,&quot; he says.    With the clock running at Mr. DeJong's discretion, the Scandia leaves the overcrowded cove and prowls the shoreline, hunting for another school. Mr. Joyce hunches over the fish scanner, while crewmen peer over the side for the silvery glint of herring. An hour later, Mr. Joyce sees enough blips to risk another cast. The boat makes a wide sweep, letting the net out again in a big circle. Red, white and yellow corks bob on the swells. Lead weights hold down the bottom of the net.    As the crew slowly winches the net back on board, the mesh swells out with tons of thrashing fish. &quot;Solid herring,&quot; Mr. Joyce announces.    After four hours of frenetic fishing, Mr. DeJong declares the season closed. The box score: 4,200 tons of herring worth more than $4.5 million to the fishermen, several nets in tatters, a half-dozen near-collisions in the air and one miserable skipper whose boat ran aground. The top boat boasts a catch of about 190 tons. The Scandia, despite its initial problems, still manages to haul in about 80 tons, worth an estimated $100,000. For an afternoon's work, the five crewmen will get about $10,000 each. Mr. Joyce will pay his spotter a fee and pocket the rest.    After a celebratory beer, Mr. Joyce heads for the harbor. &quot;We could have been heroes, but we made wages,&quot; he says. &quot;Now it's back to reality.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
