 Apple onlyhad to show a screenshot to differentiate the Macintosh from any otherpersonal computers, and if customers bought the machine they were buying thepromise of the user interface.andM;Today, with the presence of Windows 3.0 and OS/2 1.2, Apple has to change itsstory -- the user interface advantage has virtually disappeared.andP;  But Applestill believes it has some strong cards to play, in user interfaces as wellas other areas.andP;  What is it about the Macintosh that still makes it sodifferent?andM;The obvious thing is that the Macintosh user interface is integrated fullywith the disk filing system, unlike Windows and Presentation Manager.andP;  In PCenvironments the file management has to be done in a separate program, usingthe naming and command conventions of MS-DOS and OS/2, while in the Macintoshthe Desktop, and its Finder and MultiFinder file managers, work just like anyother Macintosh application.andP;  Every Macintosh program presents the samedialogue boxes when users want to open or save files, long and meaningfulfilenames are automatically supported, and the Macintosh file structure meansthat links between applications and the files they produce are created andmaintained automatically.andM;Under MultiFinder, multiple programs can be opened in separate screen windowson the Desktop, each taking over the menu bar at the top of the screen whenit's the 'frontmost', active application.andP;  The underlying Desktop, with itsicon-dragging file management functions, can be called up instantly to createnew folders -- equivalent to sub-directories in DOS -- rename files, andperform any other tasks.andM;In Windows and PM, however, the desktop metaphor has been abandonedcompletely and the file manager is just another program with its own windowand menu bar within the window, floating in a conceptually meaningless'workspace'.andP;  Each application window in Windows 3.0 can have its ownworkspace with its own child windows and its own icons, and the consistencyand simplicity of the Macintosh desktop idea has gone.andM;On the other hand, MultiFinder isn't a true multi-tasking environment.andO;Applications have to volunteer to relinquish control of the processor ratherthan having control taken from them by other programs using user-definedpriorities.andP;  There's no way to adjust the amounts of processor time given todifferent MultiFinder programs, and no memory protection to preventill-behaved programs crashing the system.andP;  Windows 3.0 is a bettermulti-tasker than MultiFinder, and OS/2 is infinitely better.andM;But the ROM-based user interface code of the Macintosh, and the tightintegration of the file manager with the rest of the machine, means thatMacintosh applications are smaller, require less RAM and run faster at agiven processor speed than MS-DOS rivals.andM;Where the Macintosh style really scores, however, is in software and hardwareconfiguration.andP;  Installing Macintosh software is generally just a matter ofcopying the files from floppy disks to the hard disk, with no fiddling aroundwith CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT, or with PIF files in Windows.andP;  Everyapplication can sense the number and size of Macintosh screens connected andadapt automatically, and also uses however much memory is available withinthe limits set by users in MultiFinder.andM;Hardware installation, too, is much simpler.andP;  Hard disks plug into the SCSIport and are instantly available after formatting.andP;  Scanners and printersdaisy-chain on to the same port without clashes, as long as their SCSI IDnumbers are different.andP;  Any special drives just need to be dropped into theSystem Folder on the Macintosh hard disk, where they're built into theoperating system at boot time.andP;  There's no chance of an interrupt or I/O portclash, because the Macintosh architecture has been designed to make detailslike that irrelevant to users.andP;  The advantages of Apple's complete controlover the machine and its operating system are clear.andM;But that complete control also means that software and hardware developersare totally dependent on what Apple does next.andP;  At present, softwaredevelopment is stalled while Apple struggles to get the complex andsignificant System 7.0 upgrade out.andM;There are a lot of things that make users' lives easier in the Macintoshworld, at the cost of flexibility and price.andP;  Trade-offs must be made betweensimple hardware and software installation and a more limited and moreexpensive third-party add-on market, and between consistency in filemanagement and applications and stalled software development while Appleagonises over a new System release.andP;  So far, the high prices of Macintoshsystems have biased these trade-offs in the PC's favour.andP;  The three newmachines in this review are meant to redress the balance.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
