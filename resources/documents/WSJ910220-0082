In a report to Congress that was disclosed tocongressional staff yesterday, the General Accounting Officealso expressed skepticism about whether the structure of theclean-up bureaucracy makes sense. Currently, the leadclean-up agency, called the Resolution Trust Corp., sharesthe same board and chairman with the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. Eight other federal departments or agenciesare involved.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;A question we need to begin discussing now is whether theinterests of the American taxpayers would be best served byseparating RTC from FDIC, and giving RTC its own chiefexecutive officer,&quot; said the report, written by CharlesBowsher, head of the GAO. The FDIC, he noted, is likely to bepreoccupied in the future with weakness in the bankingindustry.   The report is scheduled to be presented today to the HouseBanking Committee. The panel is expected soon to approveanother round of funds for the Sandamp;L clean-up. The GAO endorseda plan to give the RTC what it is projected to need for oneyear -- almost $80 billion -- rather than unlimited spendingauthority as requested by the Bush administration.   The $80 billion would include $48 billion in temporarycash, which the agency expects to recoup through the sale ofassets from the failed thrifts. Still, the cleanup agencysaid its net costs eventually will total $130 billion, morethan double what the administration predicted in 1989.   The report, written in mild language, acknowledges thatselling a wide array of assets from failed Sandamp;Ls is far fromsimple. The GAO took pains to characterize the cleanupagency's approach to selling the Sandamp;L franchises as &quot;fair andopen&quot; and said the agency has sold a &quot;satisfactory&quot; number.It also noted the obvious challenge of starting up a5,000-employee agency from scratch to operate a $145 billionfinancial institution.   But the GAO said that the cleanup agency needs to do abetter job of tracking its assets from far-flung Sandamp;Ls and toimprove its marketing of the assets and its system forsecuring private managers for those assets. Most of thecriticism focused on policies and rules that differ amongregions and the several hundred government-managed thrifts.For example, the RTC has no computer database to keep trackof all of its $78 billion in securities. Only its roughly $5billion in high-yield junk bonds are tracked.   Similarly, the agency's start-and-stop efforts to sellreal estate -- $3.9 billion of its $18 billion in real estatehas been sold -- have been disappointing, the GAO said. &quot;Thisassessment takes into account that disposing of distressedreal estate is much more difficult than most people hadanticipated,&quot; the report says.   The RTC, which was to finish its work by 1997, is likelyto require at least an additional four years in somedistressed markets to sell the real estate, the GAO added.</TEXT></DOC>
