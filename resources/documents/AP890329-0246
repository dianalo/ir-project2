There was no immediate indication that rivals General MotorsCorp. and Chrysler Corp. would match the move by Ford, which alsosaid it was scaling back its full-year projections for industrywidecar and light truck sales.   GM and Chrysler currently offer cash rebates of up to $2,000 andfinancing as low as 4.9 percent on a variety of cars and trucks.   Ford _ which had been offering similar incentives _ cited risinginterest rates that have sapped consumer demand and slowed sales asprompting its stepped-up program.   Robert Rewey, Ford's North American sales vice president, saidvehicle sales during the first 80 days of 1989 fell belowexpectations and Ford was lowering its prediction for industrywidecar and light truck sales to about 15 million from the previous15.4 million.   ``People still want to buy cars and trucks, (but) there may besome hesitation,'' Rewey said.   Part of that hesitation stemmed from the recent rise in interestrates set by the Federal Reserve and banks. Banks have boostedtheir prime lending rate _ used as a benchmark on a range ofconsumer and business loans _ to 11.5 percent from 10.5 percent atthe first of the year.   The banks have boosted their rates in response to interest ratepressure by the Fed, which is attempting to curb inflation bytightening credit.   Rising rates have ratcheted up house payments for people withadjustable-rate mortgages, causing a slowing in consumer spendingfor durable goods such as cars and trucks, Rewey said.   ``There has to be concern of the very rampant move of interestrates in the first quarter'' of this year, he said.   ``We believe the Federal Reserve actions have generated whatthey wanted to generate,'' he said.   Vehicle sales between Jan. 1 and March 20 this year by the eightcompanies making cars in North America were 5.4 percent behind lastyear's pace. Automobile sales were off 8.2 percent and truck saleswere 0.3 percent lower than in the year-earlier period.   U.S. sales during the first 80 days of the year have beenrunning at an annual rate of about 14.6 million vehicles, Reweysaid. Typically, March and April are big buying months as Americansprepare for the summertime driving season.   Automakers and analysts have said since late last year theyexpected sales to decline from 1988, the second-best ever. Butthere has been concern on Wall Street that recent sales figureswere lower than anticipated.   ``It's not surprising given that the 20-day (sales) numbers forMarch do not look good,'' said analyst Jeannette Garretty of theBank of America in San Francisco. ``This first quarter is showingup very weak.''   Incentives cut directly into profits and analysts are reviewingFord's earnings picture.   ``My guess is that it may prevent Ford's first-quarter earningsfrom being higher than last year's,'' said David Healy of DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc. of New York. ``They could be down about 10percent.''   But Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, saidFord's financial strength overseas would cancel out lower profitsin North America.   ``There are offsets to the costs of these incentive programs,''he said. ``So we may not see a significant reduction in earnings inthe first quarter. I'm not going to change my numbers.''   Wall Street also has been concerned that the industry's vehicleinventories have been running higher than anticipated. Ward'sAutomotive Reports, a weekly industry publication, said that by theend of February there was an 78-day supply of cars on dealer lots.   Ford's car inventory stood at 82 days on March 20 and truckinventory was 76 days, Rewey said, virtually the same since thefirst of the year.</TEXT></DOC>
