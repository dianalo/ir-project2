Initial deposition of {sup 238}PuO{sub2} in the respiratory tract was followed by translocation of a portionof the {sup 238}Pu to the liver and skeleton, which resulted in a largedose commitment and tumor risk to all three tissues. In a populationof 144 dogs exposed to {sup 238}PuO{sub 2}, 112 dogs died or were killed4000 days after {sup 238}Pu exposure, 100 dogs had osteosarcoma, and28 dogs had lung cancers. At increasing times after exposure, however,liver lesions have become more pronounced. Ten primary liver tumors innine animals were diagnosed in the dogs dying before 4000 days afterexposure. An additional five primary liver tumors in three dogs occurredin 9 animals killed after 4000 days after exposure. The majority of thesetumors have been fibrosarcomas. The liver tumors were usually not thecause of death, and rarely metastasized. The occurrence of liver tumorsin this study indicates that {sup 238}Pu is an effective hepatic carcinogen.Liver carcinogenesis is assuming an increasing importance in this studyat late times after inhalation exposure. These results suggest that theliver may be an important organ at risk for the development of neoplasiain humans at time periods long after inhalation of {sup 238}Pu.</TEXT></DOC>
