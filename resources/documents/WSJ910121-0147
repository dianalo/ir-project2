Teikoku Data Bank Ltd. also said the volume of debts leftbehind by bankrupt companies climbed 62.8% in the year to1.94 trillion yen (US$14.66 billion), as a result of thefailure of some big businesses.</LP><TEXT>   However, in the fourth quarter of last year, the number ofbankruptcies rose significantly. In December alone,insolvencies jumped 44.9% to 713 cases, from a year earlier.Agency officials noted that a record 12 major companies, orthose capitalized at 10 billion yen or more, went out ofbusiness, a record high. Liabilities soared more thanfive-fold from a year earlier to 487.04 billion yen, a recordfor the month.   The officials warned that the rise in the last threemonths of 1990 could be an indication that bankruptcies maycontinue to grow this year. Corporate bankruptcies had beendeclining through October, but they began rising as theimpact of the tight credit filtered through the economy,according to the officials.   In the final quarter of 1990, an increasing number ofbusinesses, especially real estate and related companies,closed as a result of high interest rates, falling stockprices and a continuing tight labor market. In October, forinstance, bankruptcies increased 21.2% from November to 645cases and also went up from the year-earlier levels for thefirst time in 70 months. In November, business failures againclimbed from a year earlier, to 634.   Economists generally think that Japan's economy will slowdown this year after more than four years of expansion,heralding trouble for some companies.   The December statistics showed, officials said, thattighter credit conditions the Bank of Japan has set in motionin an effort to remove the threat of inflation appear to havebeen taking effect.   The central bank has raised the official discount ratefive times since May 1989 to 6% a year, and has curbedcommercial bank lending also to contain inflationarypressures and sustain the current economic growth, now in its50th uninterrupted month.   In 1990, officials noted, stocks, bonds and the yen alldeclined early in the year, and this combined with higherborrowing costs to hurt Japanese businesses. Nevertheless,they said, corporate sales and earnings remained strongoverall as a result of the booming domestic demand-ledeconomy and helped prevent insolvencies.   During the year, the number of companies that went out ofbusiness as a result of labor shortages soared 2.4 times the1989 level to 310 cases.   One hundred and three companies folded as a result offailures in financial investments, shooting up from 18 in1989.   Failures among real estate companies climbed 25.1% from1989 to 329, many as a result of unsuccessful landspeculation.   Bankruptcies in the construction industry declined 19.1%from the preceding year to 1,385, and those amongmanufacturers as a whole dropped 15.9% to 932. The wholesaleindustry showed a 5.6% decline, with the number of failuresat 1,661 cases. There were 1,273 bankruptcies in the retailindustry, down 11.7% from 1989.   The number of businesses that failed with debt of morethan 100 million yen dropped 0.5% to 1,946. The averageamount of debt during the year was 300 million yen,ballooning from 165 million yen in 1989.   Officials said 5,241 companies capitalized at less than 10million yen closed their doors during 1990, down 13.2%. Theyaccounted for 81% of the total, compared with 83.4% in 1989.   In December, officials said, both the number of insolventcompanies and the amount of liabilities stayed above theyearearlier levels for the third straight month. The numberof insolvencies in the month exceeded the 700-level for thefirst time in 21 months, they pointed out.   They said the average amount of liabilities reached arecord for the month of 683 million yen, far more than theprevious high of 273 million yen in December 1987.   In the latest reporting month, 64 real estate or relatedcompanies failed because of heavy interest burdens, thehighest for any month last year. There were 40 suchbankruptcies in the previous month and only 19 a yearearlier, according to officials.   It was the first time in six years, they said, that thenumber of real estate bankruptcies had risen above 60 casesin December.   Those stemming from labor shortages also set a record inthe month, totaling 42 cases. That contrasted with 39 inNovember and 10 in the year-earlier month.   There were 18 insolvencies resulting from financialinvestment failures, exceeding 14 such cases in November andsetting a record for any month in 1990.   Officials said 550 companies capitalized at less than 10million yen were bankrupt in December, up 31.8% from a yearearlier. They represented 77.1% of the total, a decline from84.8% a year earlier. There were 142 failures of companiescapitalized between 10 million and 50 million yen, more thandoubling from the year-earlier month, and 13 failures ofbusinesses with capital between 50 million and 100 millionyen, up from seven a year earlier. Eight companiescapitalized at more than 100 million yen folded, in contrastto only one in December 1989.   A total of 235 corporations went down with debt of morethan 100 million yen each, a 78.0% year-to-year jump. Theaverage amount of liabilities came to 683 million yen,soaring 269.2%.   Agency officials, noting that the Bank of Japan hasdecided to hold the pace of growth in major commercial banklending in the January-March quarter 32.9% below theyear-earlier levels, predicted that more companies, small andmedium-sized businesses in particular, may have increasingdifficulties raising money.   The central bank is unlikely to ease its credit grip anytime soon, judging from its sensitivity to inflationarypressures such as rising personnel and distribution costs,they noted. As a result, bankruptcies stemming from manpowershortages could rise in the construction, manufacturing,wholesale and other industries, according to officials.</TEXT></DOC>
