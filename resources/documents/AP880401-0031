California would jump to 50 members of the House, a gain offive, according to an analysis by the Library of Congress.   David C. Huckabee of the Library's Congressional ResearchService recalculated the House distribution based on the new CensusBureau projections of populations in 1990. The estimates werereleased Thursday.   Huckabee cautioned, however, that his calculation is based onestimates, and a very small change in population can shift a Houseseat from one state to another.   In 1970, for example, a difference of fewer than 300 people gaveOklahoma rather than Connecticut an additional House seat, he said.   With House seats limited to 435, every gain by one state means aloss for another.   In addition to California, Huckabee calculated that Texas wouldgain four new seats in the House and Florida would gain three.   Adding two seats would be Arizona and Georgia, while NorthCarolina and Virginia would each pick up one.   On the other hand, New York and Pennsylvania would each dropthree seats, he calculated. Losing two apiece would be Illinois,Michigan and Ohio. Expected to lose one would be Iowa, Kansas,Massachusetts, Montana, West Virginia and Wisconsin.   Huckabee's figures differ slightly from those of William O'Hareat the private Population Reference Bureau, who used a differentset of 1990 estimates.   Election Data Services, a private consulting firm, also issuedsomewhat different reapportionment estimates earlier this year,based on 1987 Census estimates.</TEXT></DOC>
