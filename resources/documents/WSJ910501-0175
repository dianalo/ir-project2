Mr. Mancuso has filed a $45million lawsuit against Paramount.   Although Paramount reviewed a number of potentialcandidates, Mr. Tartikoff emerged as the front-runnerrecently, and word of the talks has spread quickly throughthe Hollywood community. Both Mr. Tartikoff and Paramounthave declined to comment since the discussions were firstreported in a trade daily, the Hollywood Reporter, last week.   Mr. Tartikoff has been represented in his talks withParamount by attorney Ken Ziffern and Michael Ovitz, head ofthe powerful Creative Artists Agency. The NBC executive haslong been considered a candidate for a top studio job. Othertop movie studio executives, such as Barry Diller, chairmanof News Corp.'s Fox Inc. unit, and Michael Eisner, chairmanof Walt Disney Co., came from network television.   Mr. Tartikoff has turned down other opportunities to leavethe network, including an offer to run the movie productionunit of Columbia Pictures before Coca-Cola Co. sold it toSony Corp. Mr. Tartikoff instead stayed on at NBC, greatlyexpanding his reach over the network's news and entertainmentoperations.
