The two cases raise the question of whether the U.S.Constitution requires states to pay refunds to taxpayers whenstate taxes are ruled unconstitutional. If the answer fromthe high court is affirmative, the implications could bestaggering.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The stakes are just enormous for the states,&quot; says WalterHellerstein, a University of Georgia Law School professor andtax-law expert.   The Multistate Tax Commission, an organizationrepresenting state tax officials, found that 30 states couldface potential tax-refund liability of $6.5 billion. &quot;Ifrefunds . . . are too readily available, state and localgovernments will face not only revenue shortfalls but alsounexpected and potentially ruinous liability,&quot; said the Stateand Local Legal Center, which represents state and localgovernment groups.   The cases before the high court involve two types oftaxes, but the outcome could apply much more widely.   In one case, the justices are considering an appeal by theAmerican Trucking Associations of an Arkansas Supreme Courtdecision. Relying on an earlier U.S. Supreme Court decision,the Arkansas court in March 1988, ruled that the state'shighway-use tax discriminated in favor of trucking companiesbased in Arkansas and against companies based in otherstates. But the Arkansas court said no refunds were requiredfor taxes already paid.   According to a brief filed by a group of states, thehighway-use tax issue is pending in five states -- Arkansas,Pennsylvania, Kentucky, New Jersey and Vermont. Potentialrefunds total $630.9 million plus interest.   The second case before the high court involves an appealby McKesson Corp., a San Francisco-based liquor distributor,which successfully challenged a 1985 Florida law that gavetax preferences to alcoholic beverages made from Floridaproducts, such as citrus and sugar cane. In February 1988,the Florida Supreme Court ruled that the tax wasdiscriminatory and unconstitutional, but declined to orderrefunds. Lawyers representing McKesson say they don't knowhow much of a refund would be involved if the Supreme Courtwere to order one now. A similar issue also has arisen inGeorgia over a liquor tax.   But the greatest impact of the high court's ruling, byfar, could involve another kind of tax. In March 1989, thehigh court struck down a Michigan law that taxed the pensionbenefits of retired federal employees but exempted theretirement income of state and local government workers. Thejustices said states could tax all government pensions ornone, but couldn't discriminate.   The high court didn't say whether the states had to refundthe taxes already collected. According to a recent survey bythe Federation of Tax Administrators, an organization ofstate tax officials, lawsuits for refunds have been filed in24 states, and the potential liability of those states isnearly $2 billion. Many of those states are awaiting theoutcome of the two pending Supreme Court decisions to decidewhether to make refunds.   Of course, the court could rule that states may followtheir own tax laws in deciding whether to make refunds, orthat there is no federal constitutional requirement thatinvalid taxes be refunded.   &quot;If the states can enact unconstitutional tax laws withoutworrying about the consequences, that's very significant,&quot;says Professor Hellerstein, who is advising McKesson in thecase. &quot;With no refund remedy, you have no deterrent effect,&quot;he says.   The court also might decide the two cases on moretechnical, narrow grounds that would render the impactuncertain on the pension disputes and many other lawsuitsraising tax-refund issues, a few of which have been broughtto the court's attention in briefs.   Whatever the outcome, the cases have been difficult forthe justices. They heard arguments in March 1989, and ordereda second round of arguments last December. Says Andrew Frey,a Washington lawyer representing the American TruckingAssociations, &quot;Obviously something about these cases isgiving the court extraordinary difficulty. That suggeststhey're considering a ruling that would have significantramifications for state taxes.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
