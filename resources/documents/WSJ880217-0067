On the Democratic side, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis showed strength across the board among voters in this neighboring state. In the battle for second place, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri won backing from blue-collar voters, union members and elderly New Hampshirites, who outnumber professional and managerial and younger and more liberal voters, who went to Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois.    President Reagan, the survey showed, remains enormously popular here, getting a positive rating from more than 80% of the Republican voters, and Mr. Bush bested his main rival, Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, among those voters. The vice president's positive rating was 2-1 -- not as high as the president scored but still an impressive performance.    Sen. Dole did especially poorly among voters describing themselves as very conservative -- who comprise about a fifth of the Republican electorate -- trailing not only the vice president but the other three GOP candidates as well.    When asked who was more conservative, 52% of New Hampshirites said Mr. Bush and only 22% said Sen. Dole, the election-day survey showed.    Efforts by the conservative candidates -- Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, former Delaware Gov. Pierre du Pont and former religious broadcaster Pat Robertson -- to score points by opposing the recent U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear missiles from Europe fell flat. Even in this conservative state, the Journal/NBC news poll showed that Republican voters favored this treaty 67% to 20%.    The vice president also seemed to successfully tap the traditional anti-tax sentiment in New Hampshire yesterday. Of the Republican voters, 51% said they weren't worried enough about the federal budget deficit to have their taxes increased, and Mr. Bush ran almost 15 points ahead of Sen. Dole among these voters. Mr. Bush scored similarly well among the almost two-thirds of New Hampshirites who said they opposed a tax on imported oil, a proposition that Sen. Dole had said he might support.    There were some pluses for Sen. Dole in the election day survey. New Hampshire voters consider him a stronger leader than they do Vice President Bush. And the Iran-Contra issue still plagues Mr. Bush, with more than half the voters saying he hasn't given a full accounting of his role. Although Mr. Bush wasn't considered as strong as his rival, voters did give him higher marks for being compassionate and caring. And when asked if Sen. Dole has a &quot;mean streak,&quot; the voters split about evenly.    Mr. Robertson won a plurality of the self-described born-again Christians, but that isn't an especially large voting block in New Hampshire. And the former TV evangelist did very poorly among other groups.    Among Democrats, the Journal/NBC survey showed, Gov. Dukakis received about a 2-1 positive rating. About two-thirds of those supporting him said they supported him strongly, but, interestingly, of the voters who made up their minds in the closing weeks of the contest, Mr. Dukakis ran about even with Rep. Gephardt and Sen. Simon.    Mr. Gephardt, who came under fire from his opponents and the press in recent days, had fairly high negatives in New Hampshire, and Democratic voters split about evenly on whether his protectionist trade measure would help or hurt the economy. But the survey showed the intensity of his support was greater than that for Sen. Simon.    New Hampshire Democrats gave the Rev. Jesse Jackson an impressive 58% to 24% favorable rating. But two-thirds of these voters thought the country isn't ready to elect a black president.    Not surprisingly, voters were decidedly negative on former Sen. Gary Hart, with about two-thirds expressing an unfavorable opinion and about two-thirds saying that he shouldn't have re-entered the presidential race.    Republicans were more optimistic about the economy generally and their own financial situations than were Democrats. Three-fourths of the Republican voters thought that the economy would either get better or stay the same by next year, compared with only half the Democratic voters. </TEXT></DOC>
