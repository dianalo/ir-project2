<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-80-0219 </DOCNO><TEXT>The role and required functions of communication techniques for automatedpower facility operation systems directed toward integration are outlined.The high speed large capacity digital transmission developed for totalautomated systems, and the multipurpose transmission equipment miniaturizedwith LSIs and intended to assign its functions to plural MPUs are described,and the outline of the planned transmission network is indicated. Referringto the standardization of transmission interfaces, the sample of thestandardization of communication protocols is illustrated, and the featuresof digital transmission are pointed out to be important factors for thetotal automated systems by comparing with that of analog transmission.As future trends, the monitoring with graphical information, difficultto digitalize in present, by advanced data compression techniques andhigher speed data transmission, the development of the equipment capableof transmitting digital data at speed as high as 1 Mbps, and the useof 32 or 64bits MPUs for realtime processing systems are described.
