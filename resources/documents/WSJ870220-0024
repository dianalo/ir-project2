In what is believed to be the first transaction of its kind, the FDIC will make a one-time $150 million payment to shore up the reserves of BancTexas's 11 subsidiary banks in order to make the company attractive to private investors. Under the arrangement, an investment group organized by Hallwood Group Inc., a little-known merchant banker with offices in Cleveland and New York, will take over the Dallas-based holding company, which has $1.3 billion of assets.    Separately, BancTexas said its fourth-quarter loss widened to $99.1 million, from $24 million a year earlier. The banking concern also posted a record net loss of $134.4 million for the year, compared with $35.4 million in 1985.    Hallwood will organize a stock offering to raise $50 million in new capital. The offering, which will be first made to current shareholders in BancTexas, will represent more than 96% of the holding company's ownership.    The FDIC has told BancTexas that it will provide no more assistance to either the parent or the bank subsidiaries and won't assume any of the bad loans held by the 11 banks. &quot;Instead, the holding company's new investors and the subsidiary bank managers will be expected to implement their own strategies for dealing with these assets and maintaining the bank units in sound condition,&quot; the agency's statement said.    BancTexas's senior creditors have agreed to settle obligations of $25 million for about $8.5 million in cash, $2 million in common stock of the restructured company and warrants to purchase as much as 5% of the company. Included among the creditors are Bankers Trust New York Corp., Continental Illinois Corp. and Security Pacific Corp., some of the nation's largest bank holding companies.    The plan is subject to the approval of BancTexas's shareholders.    Hallwood has wanted to do a restructuring of a Southwest bank or thrift since last spring. The international merchant banker specializes in restructuring near-bankrupt companies, but its proposals were initially viewed with skepticism by the FDIC and other banking experts.    Hallwood initially proposed that the FDIC assume some of BancTexas's bad loans in return for its leading a debt restructuring and directing management. At BancTexas, however, Richard L. Ripley, president and chief executive officer, said he expects to stay in his job &quot;to the best of my knowledge.&quot; He added, however, that most of the negotiations about the restructuring of the company had taken place between Hallwood and the FDIC.    The arrangement is a better alternative than selling the banks and their assets once they had failed, and could serve as a model for future transactions, said FDIC Chairman William Seidman.    &quot;We believe there is a very considerable savings to us, and yet it's a viable transaction for the investors,&quot; Mr. Seidman said. &quot;It's a novel approach . . . We're going to look toward this kind of transaction wherever we can.&quot;    The FDIC had previously rejected requests to provide assistance to banks seeking control of BancTexas and to provide open-bank aid to BancTexas itself. If the agency hadn't acted yesterday, all but one or two of BancTexas's subsidiary banks probably would have failed eventually, according to Mr. Seidman.    Had that happened, the failed banks would have been turned over to the FDIC for disposition. In most cases, the agency sells the failed bank to another institution along with the good loans. The FDIC purchases the bad loans and tries to salvage whatever it can.    Mr. Seidman estimated that the agency would have been required to spend between $300 million and $400 million to take control of the problem assets in the BancTexas group. Additional costs would have been incurred to maintain those assets until they could be sold, probably at a loss.    After studying the situation, FDIC officials concluded that a one-time $150 million payment would be &quot;substantially less&quot; than the agency's eventual cost if the banks had failed, Mr. Seidman said.    In addition, by keeping the banks' loans in the banking system, the arrangement protects the value of those assets, Mr. Seidman said. &quot;When we take over assets, it's like taking a new car off the lot -- they immediately lose 25% of the value because it's out of the private sector,&quot; he said.    BancTexas is the first major casualty among banking concerns in Texas's money centers. Saddled with souring real estate loans in the Houston area, its operations were struggling long before its larger competitors in Dallas and Houston got into trouble.    The holding company took a turn for the worse last year, when oil prices dropped and the Texas economy plunged into a broad and deep recession.    Mr. Ripley cited the continued deterioration of the Texas economy and its effect on BancTexas's loan portfolios for the fourth-quarter and 1986 losses.    At Dec. 31, BancTexas nonperforming assets were $106.9 million, or 14% of loans and other collateral, a percentage more than twice what regulators consider acceptable. Its nonperforming assets rose from $64.3 million, or 5.45%, at Dec. 31, 1985. Additionally, the banking company said, its primary capital, or total of shareholders' equity and loan-loss reserves, at year-end 1986 was a slim 1.52% of assets, compared with 5.4% at Dec. 31, 1985.    BancTexas said its independent auditor is considering issuing a qualified report for 1986. The qualification relates to whether Hallwood's proposed restructuring will be successfully completed.    BancTexas's banking subsidiaries have been steady borrowers of emergency funds at the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, averaging $135 million a day in the first nine months of 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
