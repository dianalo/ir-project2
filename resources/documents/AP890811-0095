The protest caused a delay of at least one year in research atthe Agriculture Ministry's ITAL institute, which planted thepotatoes in June, said institute spokesman Willem Stiekema.   The potato plants were ripped out of the ground tossed on a heapearly Thursday, according to police spokesman H. Martin. No arrestswere made.   In a letter to the Dutch national news agency, the group saidthe protest was aimed at using genetic manipulation to makepotatoes more resistant to herbicides.   Stiekema confirmed that one group of potatoes was involved insuch an experiment, adding that another batch had been geneticallymanipulated to resist a common potato virus.   ``In a third type, we implanted two (manipulated) gens that wereseachers can play around with a little,'' Stiekma said.   ITAL is one of several biotechnological research institutes inthis central Dutch city.</TEXT></DOC>
