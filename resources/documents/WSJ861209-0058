If Mozambique, whose Marxist government has in recent years sought aid from the West, doesn't receive new assistance, it is likely to turn back to the Soviet bloc in a desperate effort to prevent total disintegration in the face of military pressure from the Mozambique National Resistance, or Renamo, and the economic catastrophe that has been growing since Mozambique won independence from Portugal in 1975.    Yet, while food aid can help ward off starvation, any development aid is likely to be futile. Renamo has proved it can blow up whatever the government builds.    And a prostrate Mozambique insures that South Africa will continue its stranglehold on the black nations of southern Africa because it controls the major transportation routes.    &quot;The only people who benefit from the current situation are the South Africans and the Soviets,&quot; says Republican Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Africa.    Zimbabwe already stations troops in Mozambique in an effort to keep Renamo from completely closing the rail and road routes to the port of Beira, and Zimbabwe Prime Minister Robert Mugabe has discussed internationalizing the anti-Renamo forces. The Commonwealth Secretariat has been promoting discussions of the feasibility of forming a United Nations peacekeeping force for Mozambique.    At the recent funeral of Mozambique's first president, Samora Machel, representatives of Mozambique's neighbors and members of the Commonwealth discussed a peacekeeping force. &quot;It may just be that we can get some momentum because what is going on doesn't suit anyone other than South Africa,&quot; says one participant.    But the obstacles are enormous. &quot;Do you think that's really a starter?&quot; asks a Republican Senate aide. &quot;I don't think so. American conservative groups would go up to the ceiling, not just up the wall over that one.&quot; He points out that Congress has banned military aid to Mozambique and adds: &quot;I don't see anyone getting enthusiastic about economic aid either.&quot;    A U.S. businessman with close ties to Mozambique thinks the mere discussion of an international force would have a positive effect by turning a spotlight on Mozambique's problems. In Irangate Washington these problems don't capture much attention. Four Democratic members of Congress who play major foreign policy roles were asked through aides to comment on what could be done in Mozambique. None replied over a two-week period.    Perhaps the biggest obstacle to forming a peacekeeping force would be its cost. &quot;There aren't a lot of potential underwriters for that idea,&quot; says the sympathetic businessman.    A further hurdle would be potential vetoes by the Soviet Union or the U.S. Advocates of a peacekeeping force argue that the Soviets might refrain to avoid a desperation plea by Mozambique for military support. While U.S. conservatives would be loath to back any support for a Marxist regime, at the same time they might prefer international action if the alternative were unilateral action by Moscow.    &quot;I personally think it's kind of an intriguing idea,&quot; says Sen. Kassebaum, but she quickly adds that she detects little congressional interest in aiding Mozambique. </TEXT></DOC>
