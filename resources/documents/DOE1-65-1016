Why is itso hard for the United States and the USSR to negotiate mutually beneficialarms control agreements? The question arises most pointedly in lightof the failure of the first Reagan administration to achieve progresson arms control. But it applies as well to other attempts - past, present,and future - by the two superpowers to resort to direct diplomatic meansto moderate the arms race and help reduce the chances of nuclear war.In the author's view there are certain important idiosyncrasies in thenegotiating positions of both parties that make it particularly difficultfor them to reach such agreements, To show what he means first takesa look at the preferred format for arms limitation, the treaty; thendeals with arms limitation through unilateral actions; and finally reviewsthe historical background of several major lines of arms control negotiations.In so doing, he draws in part on his experience as a participant in suchsessions, particularly in the latest round of the longest-running nuclear-armscontrol discussions of all: the sporadic twenty-five-year-old effortto achieve a comprehensive ban on nuclear-weapons tests.</TEXT></DOC>
