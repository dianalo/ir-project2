The lower rates, accepted by the Federal Communications Commission, affect voice, data and video-conference transmissions on private digital networks. Comsat said its lowest rate for a standard circuit to Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean was cut to $420 a month under a seven-year contract from $550 a month under a five-year agreement. The company, which links the U.S. by satellite to 160 other countries and 6,500 ships and offshore sites, also plans to promote the lower rates in the Far East and other markets.    Theodore W. Boll, Comsat's director of tariffs, said the initial effect would be to reduce revenue from existing customers for existing traffic by about $92,000 over the next 12 months. He said it isn't possible to project a near-term effect on earnings. Last year, Comsat's international business services generated revenue of about $7 million.    &quot;Over the longer term, we hope the rate reductions will stimulate usage, bringing us more traffic and more revenues,&quot; Mr. Boll said. He said Comsat also expects the lower rates to help &quot;retain traffic that we would otherwise lose.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
