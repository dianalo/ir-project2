Japanese companies came under fire for not hiring enoughminorities, particularly blacks, in the United States following astring of remarks by politicians and sales campaigns in Japan thatsmacked of racism.   Racial awareness in Japan takes on added significance as growingJapanese investment in America _ $14.7 billion in fiscal 1987according to Japanese statistics _ puts more American workers inJapanese-owned businesses.   ``They don't realize they are obliged, under the Federal ContractCompliance Program, to achieve certain goals and quotas if they dobusiness with the U.S. government,'' says Colleen O'Connor of theAmerican Civil Liberties Union.   The hiring regulations apply to Japanese firms ``whether theysell engines to the Pentagon or cameras to the Forest Service,'' Ms.O'Connor says.   Remarks by former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and ex-FinanceMinister Michio Watanabe in the past two years suggested that blackswere intellectually inferior and defaulted on their debts.   Japanese toys resembling black Sambo figures, with huge eyes anddistorted red lips, and advertising campaigns using similarlyexaggerated mannequins last summer further angered American blacks.   Sanrio, creator of the Sambo-like figures, recalled the productsat a loss of $11.5 million and also apologized, announcing it woulddonate $257,000 in toys to poor children in San Francisco.   But black dolls continue to sell in Japan, including a blackSambo Santa Claus this past Christmas season, and are used innumerous advertisments.   Mervyn Dymally, a black U.S. congressman from California, hascomplained that Japan was not making progress on racial awareness.``In typical Asian fashion, they have been very polite, but nothinghas happened,'' he said.   More than two dozen black organizations called for a buy-Americancampaign during Christmas to impress upon Japan the power ofAmerican blacks' $300 billion in annual consumer spending.   Japanese companies argue that they are complying with U.S.regulations. But like some U.S. firms, it may take legal action toforce them into action.   In March the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission orderedHonda of America Manufacturing to pay $6 million to 377 blacks andwomen for not hiring them sooner.   ``It's primarily a cultural difference,'' said John Eastman ofthe U.S. Civil Rights Commission in a telephone interview. ``InHonda's case, once they realized the law, they established positiverecruitment. They were willing to sit down and negotiate, and put inplace an equal opportunity program.''   But Robert Cole of the University of Michigan's business schooland visiting professor at Tokyo's Keio University says Japanesefirms tend to locate in areas away from high minority concentration.   Cole studied 100 sites of auto manufacturers and suppliers in theUnited States. ``What I found was that Japanese auto-related firmslocated in areas with relatively few blacks,'' he said in aninterview in Tokyo.   Honda is in a region with a black labor pool of 10.5 percent, butis only 2.8 percent black at its facilities in Marysville, Ohio,according to Cole's study. Nissan, in Smyrna, Tenn., would beexpected to have 19.3 percent minorities but has 14 percent, andMazda in Flat Rock, Mich., has 14.1 percent black employment vs. 29percent available.   The minority employment ratio at the three major U.S. automakersis much higher than the 11 percent that blacks represent in the U.S.labor force, Cole says.   Japanese manufacturers ``have located in rural areas which arenot heavily populated by minorities,'' agrees the Civil RightsCommission's Eastman. ``They're not locating in suburban Chicago,Detroit or Cleveland.''   Honda spokesman Roger Lambert disagrees with Cole's calculations,claiming the black labor pool within reasonable commuting distanceof Honda is only 3.5 percent. Honda also recruits blacks from Ohiohigh schools, Lambert says.   Like Toyota and electronics giant Sony, Honda contributes to theNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People, UnitedNegro College Fund and Urban League. These companies also haveincreased advertising in minority publications like Ebony and BlackEnterprise magazines and in other black community media.   Sony and Toyota retain agencies specializing in marketing tominority consumers.   Yet Cole says interviews with auto and investment consultantsfound that Japanese companies systematically sought areas with lowconcentrations of blacks and other minorities.   Japanese firms do this for ``risk minimization,'' Cole says.``Blacks are an unknown quantity.''   Japanese manufacturers, particularly automakers with largeproduction facilities, bristle at suggestions of racism.   ``We have an absolute policy of equal opportunity for minoritiesand women,'' said a Toyota spokesman in Tokyo, noting that Toyota'sminority employment in Kentucky, where the automaker operates aplant in Georgetown, is 13 percent, the highest in the state. Italso began its TEAM (Toyota Equal Access for Minorities) program inMarch to expand minority hiring.   Nissan harbors ``no discrimination based on race, sex orideology,'' says a company spokesman. ``The states set a minimum forminority hiring, and we've cleared them for certain.''   He acknowledged, however, that Tennessee, where Nissan has itsfactory, has no such regulations. Nissan does not release statisticson its minority hiring.   Sony, which employs 7,000 people in the United States, alsocontributes to minority programs at New York colleges, says Sonyspokesman Tom Sugiyama.   ``We offer trainee positions to minorities, and if they qualifywill be permanently hired,'' Sugiyama says. ``We are obliged to meetaffirmative action plans. We are above the average.''   Sony also assists young black artists in film, television andmusic.   Toshiba's policy on racial hiring is to ``leave it to our peoplethere,'' a spokesman said. ``We basically support equal opportunitybased on local laws and regulations concerning sex, age or color.It's all within the law.'' The spokesman, who would not be named,declined to provide further information.   Minority groups are also pressing for increased management roles,including auto dealerships, from the Japanese.   According to the National Association of Minority AutomobileDealers, Nissan has only one minority dealership (0.1 percent of itstotal), and Toyota has three (0.3 percent), while blacks own justeight of nearly 5,000 Japanese car dealerships in America.   Ford has 170 minority dealerships (3.4 percent) and GM 204 (2percent), the association says.   Improvements come slowly. ``There's a learning curve, and theJapanese are quick students,'' says Cole. ``But it doesn't seem tome that they're taking any leadership role, and I find thatdisturbing.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday Jan. 1</NOTE></DOC>
