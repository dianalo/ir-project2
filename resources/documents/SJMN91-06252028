Tokyo today is overwhelmed notby tradition, nor by its central role in this most remarkable of nations, butby the simple and memorably dramatic fact of its modernity.;   This aspect ofTokyo provides an extraordinary illustration of how a city and a people canpull themselves up by their bootstraps. Four decades ago this was a place ofruin. The people wore little better than rags. The nation was underoccupation, and many nearly starved. But pride and perseverance are among themultitude of Japanese qualities. And in just 40 years, an almost unimaginablerebirth has taken place. In Tokyo the evidence of it, in the buildings, in theattitude, in the sense of total confidence, in the style of the city, iseverywhere.;   A celebrated Tokyo architect, Fumihiko Maki, was recentlyquoted as saying that he and his fellow Tokyoites were &quot;experiencing anexciting moment that doesn't come often in the history of a city. Tokyo isascendant, flourishing. We have the money, the opportunity and the tradition.&quot;He also, interestingly, pointed out what is as obvious about Tokyo as it isabout that other likely candidate as a world capital city, Los Angeles -- thatit has no center, no downtown. &quot;It is a chaotic labyrinth of small,interesting inner spaces, constructed from light, fragile materials andconnected to each other by a complex network of grids, radials and spirals.&quot;;  In Tokyo all this can be seen and sensed and experienced by any visitor --through a mixture of osmosis and participation. And lest anyone is tempted todo so but is intimidated by the city's only half-deserved reputation forsky-high prices, it will be comforting to learn that this can be accomplishedfor less than the cost of a subway ticket.;   True, if you wish to savor themost exotic kind of sushi, visit a seven-story disco or indulge in the almostdecadent excesses of Tokyo consumerism (a lungful of strawberry-flavored airor a cup of gold-dusted tea), some quantity of yen will have to change hands.But simply by watching and listening, in certain places and at certain times,one can imbibe the makings of what appears to be a whole new world -- oneseemingly drawn from the pages of science fiction, yet one that exists today.The certain places are too many to count: The certain time is generally afterdark, when one takes part in the stunning drama of a modern Tokyo night, whenthe Japanese so rapturously reap the rewards of all those years of rebuildingand rebirth.;   Take an example. A glistening wet Friday evening onHarumi-Dori Avenue -- if not Tokyo's Fifth Avenue, then at least its SunsetStrip -- will provide an experience that is as good as any. To anyone who haslived in the city that has been Japan's capital since 1868, the avenue takeson a profound ordinariness. Yet to a newcomer it is as memorable a view of thecoming nature of urban life as one is ever likely to encounter.;   The imagesof empire are, it has to be said, mere fancies here. Harumi-Dori is very mucha place of the 20th, or even the 21st, century, and one walks along itplunging ever further from the courtliness of old Tokyo, and ever deeperinside the neon fantasia of shopping and entertainment of the Ginza. This isthe place where the Tokyo Mint once stood -- Ginza meaning &quot;the silverquarter,&quot; and thus yet another reminder of the city's past. Tokyo's obsessionwith tomorrow is always colored -- and that is in part what is so charming --by a remembrance of yesterday.;   Tower of buying; Venture ever deeper andyesterday soon moves over, to be replaced by, or overlain with, a wild andthrobbing and polychromatic confusion on all sides, all evidence of commerceand technology. A good place to start is the mighty, cylindrical,glass-and-chrome tower that is the San-ai Dream Center, filled with scores ofshops selling miniskirts and tight sweaters and Wacoal computer-designedautomatic memory bras (they use your body heat to mold themselves to yourcurves, then remain that way through 10,000 washes).;   On almost every corneryou will find a tiny sushi bar, perhaps an automatic one, all high-techcoziness, the patrons sipping sake cheek by jowl in a small wonderland ofbamboo and stainless steel, calligraphy and computer screens. The crew-cutitamae-san is slaving to slice and shape the slivers of blue-fin tuna andawabi and torigai and ark-shell, to ensure that the rice underneath appears tohave all its grains aligned, and to see that the nori in which the sushi willbe wrapped is crisp and flexible. And then, a little farther along the street,halfway toward the vast Tsukiji fish market in which 190 tons of tuna areauctioned to the city's sushi bars each day, stands the Kabuki-za theaterwhere, if you've a mind to (and if you come before 9 p.m.), you may watch oneof the lengthy &quot;song, dance and skill&quot; (the word's literal translation) dramasthat remain so popular in modern Japan.;   Amid maddening crowds; Just besidethe Kabuki theater, perhaps a few yards back along Harumi-Dori, is the placeto glance back. Perhaps it is quite late on that Friday night now, and therain has worsened, and the neon madness of the Ginza reflects itself as greatpuddles and smears of carmine and chartreuse and aquamarine and jasmine.;  The streets are crowded with cars and taxis and small buses, and thousandswalking hurriedly through the fiery gloom.;   Suddenly, from somewhere aboveand up a little way, comes a hiss and a rumble and a thunderous roar. Abovethe roadway something blue and white and adorned with rows of brilliantlyilluminated windows streaks across the field of vision. Whatever it is movestremendously fast, and one has the impression, what with the people and theneon and the cars and the rain and the flashing lights and movement in everyspeed and direction, of being caught up in some immense and infernal machine.;  The sensation is not at all unpleasant; in fact, most say it is ratherexciting. But there is a sudden strange feeling of being just a little out ofcontrol, as though this city has for that single moment become just toocomplicated, too many-layered and multi-textured and polychromed andbabel-filled and crowded, with too much noise and light. The whole city isexperiencing a caffeine rush, a jolt of urban electricity.;   But then calm ofa sort returns. The sound retires, the lights slow, the crowds continue,uninterested in whatever had sped by up above. They would have known, ofcourse, that it was just a bullet train, a shinkansen. Tokyo Station is but afew hundred yards up the track, and the bridge for the specially builtshinkansen road, next to but separate from the ordinary, subsonic railwayline, soars over Harumi-Dori just beyond the freeway bridge.;   At 120 milesan hour, the bullet train is an icon both of today's Tokyo and tomorrow'sworld, encapsulating in one long cylinder of metal and glass a thousand imagesof high speed, high technology, perfect accuracy, temporal precision andcleanliness, and with employees who customarily display an old-fashionedcourtliness and eternal politeness -- a transport, in other words, of sheerdelight.;   Within half an hour, then, on this stroll from the Hibiya subwaystation to the Kabuki-za theater, many of the layers of Tokyo are seamlesslyunveiled. Tradition is there. The relentless search for pleasure, invariablyerotic or narcissistic, is there, too. The high technology is everywhere, withthe automation of everything that needs automating, with the rococo use ofneon, the pulsing of the music, the blaring of the pachinko game salons, theubiquitous vision of the green-glowing, blue-glowing, unblinking computerscreen.;   World's friendliest city; And everywhere you walk you will find thepeople of Tokyo, friendlier than in any other city. The turbocharged modernityhas not changed everything: The majority of the city's 11 million people stillcling to the rituals of social protocol, and a stranger from beyond the shoresof Japan will still receive enthralled gazes from a people who are still, toan unsettling degree, unfamiliar with, and enchanted by, foreignness.;   Andall this is immersed in an ocean of Japanese tradition, dignity and harmony.;   On one level, this sea of Japanese-ness is very obvious. Almost everyone yousee is Japanese. Almost everyone behaves in a similar fashion. They dressdifferently, maybe, though usually very well; most act with an impeccablepoliteness. There is a clear pride in having everyone belonging to a commonculture. Conformity, at least by day, is everything. Eccentricity is rare.Even the most outrageous behavior is usually studied, and temporary. The punksdress up as punks for only a few hours each week, then quickly return to theirpinstripes. There is thus a delicate integrity about the place. The unpleasantfeatures of most other urban giants -- crime, poverty and decay -- are all butinvisible. They exist, but rarely intrude on the consciousness of visitors.;   On another level, there is a curious, and curiously pleasing, anarchicquality about the city, as though it presented a circus-like performance ofthe eternally unexpected.;   Unpredictable and astonishing though this side ofTokyo seems, it is also what no other city of its size and scale manages to be-- sanctuary-safe. Leave your wallet on a windowsill in Ginza, and it will bethere, its cards and bills unriffled and untaken, fully a day and a nightlater on.;   So there is infinitely more to Tokyo than the presumption thatone is living on the lip of some caldron. On any morning along Harumi-Dori,all is always back to a reassuring normal. A million men in blue suits andwhite shirts step up from the subways to a million tasks in the skyscrapers,just as in any other city.;   Red carpets everywhere; The astonishingpoliteness of the Tokyo Japanese is everywhere -- the way the store clerks bowdeeply at the customers when they first walk in, or how lift operators treatyou like royalty, or how young Japanese interrupt their hurried passage tohelp you the moment you pause to look at your map, and may walk you miles outof their way to ensure you are on target to your destination. There are themoments of absolute serenity in all the rush, in the glimpse of the flowerarrangements in a corner cafe or the sight of momentary obeisance paid by apasser-by at a shrine.;   For those who remain skeptical about the comingchange in the world's order, for those who remain unconvinced that the torchof world leadership is now passing to nations like Japan, and to the networkof nations around the Pacific, Tokyo remains to the unbelievers just this -- alabyrinth of chaos, a confusing and overwhelming place, a jungle that, for allits safety, can be unsettling, even threatening.;   But for others, thefast-swelling legions of those for whom the new Pacific age is something to bewelcomed with open arms, today's Tokyo has become an emblem, an unforgettable,heart-stopping, breathtaking icon of a future culture. It is perhaps adifficult city to love. It is a city to admire, to be awestruck by, to beutterly unable to forget. But it is manifestly not a city to regard withdisdain; and one senses about almost all those who come to know it a feelingof pleasing familiarity and comfort, a feeling of having taken part in thefuture, and discovering that it works just fine.; If you go . . .; (check)Getting There -- American Airlines flies non-stop from San Jose to Tokyo everyday but Tuesday.
