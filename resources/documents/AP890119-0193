The panel also recommended that Congress extend the duration ofthe low-income use compliance period, remove constraints to usingother federal subsidies with the tax credit and expand the pool ofinvestors who can use the credits and types of projects the creditcovers.   The recommendations were delivered to Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell, D-Maine and Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., who formedthe panel to study the tax credit last May.   Mitchell and Danforth, members of the Senate Finance Committee,said they would use the panel's report as a basis for proposedchanges in the tax law to amend and extend the current credit.   ``In my view it would be unthinkable not to extend the onlyremaining incentive in the tax code for the health of low-incomehousing,'' said Mitchell.   The low-income tax credit was amended in 1986 to encouragedevelopers to invest in building and rehabilitation of housing forlow- and moderate-income people after changes took away most of thedeductions for passive losses and property depreciation.   To get the credit, property owners must set aside either 20percent of the units in a property for families with incomes lessthan 50 percent of the median income in an area, or 40 percent forfamilies with incomes less than 60 percent of the area median.   If Congress fails to act the tax credit will expire at the end ofthis year.   The panel's recommendations came on the same day the governmentreported Thursday that housing construction fell to its lowest levelin six years in 1988. Earlier in the week, Jack Kemp,President-elect Bush's choice as secretary of the Department ofHousing and Urban Development, told city officials the tax revisionmay have gone ``too far'' and stunted low- and moderate-incomehousing construction.</TEXT></DOC>
