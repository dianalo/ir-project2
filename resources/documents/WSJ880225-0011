The suit, filed by shareholder Barnett Stepak, seeks class-action status. It named as defendants Postal, a Los Angeles-based franchiser and operator of &quot;instant&quot; printing businesses; its chairman, Thomas C. Marotto; and Golder, Thoma andamp; Cressey, a Chicago-based leveraged buy-out firm.    The suit charged that management failed to seek out other purchasers, that it &quot;manipulated its affairs to discourage third-party bids&quot; and that a so-called independent review committee &quot;didn't exercise independent judgment.&quot; The suit also alleged that management plans to increase the profitability of its assets after the buy-out.    The suit asked that the court enjoin the offer, or if that buy-out goes through, profit from the sale of the company should be disgorged to shareholders.    Officials at Postal and Golder, Thoma andamp; Cressey couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
