Angrist   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/10/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C14</SO><IN>COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD)</IN><LP>   Sugar prices dropped precipitously yesterday in the faceof reports predicting higher production levels thanpreviously expected.   The October contract settled at 11.90 cents a pound, off0.69 cent. It had opened trading about 0.17 cents a poundbelow Friday's close. The opening price was also the high forthe day, but the contract quickly dropped under pressure fromcommodity funds liquidating long positions.</LP><TEXT>   Before the market opened, a report from the EuropeanCommunity estimated that the Western Europe beet crop wouldincrease by less than 1%, or 106,000 metric tons, from anearlier estimate. Also yesterday,the Brazilian governmentauthorized a sugar output for the 1990-91 crop year of 6.85million metric tons, up from its previous authorization of6.44 million metric tons.   &quot;Those two bits of news were very poor excuses to sell themarket off 0.69 cent,&quot; said Judith Ganes, sugar analyst atMerrill Lynch Futures in New York. Rather, she said, &quot;I thinkthe whole move down has been because of speculative sellingand fund liquidation.&quot;   Ms. Ganes said she thought that the market wasn't awareyet of more, potentially bearish news contained in yetanother production report dated yesterday by F.O. Licht, aGerman firm that prepares world-wide crop estimates forsugar.   The new Licht report estimates that West European beetproduction for the 1990-91 crop year could increase by asmuch as one million metric tons over the 1989-90 harvest,Barring any unforeseen weather disasters,. The new reportalso predicts that the crop in Eastern Europe could increase,but there is more uncertainty concerning that forecast.   Ms. Ganes said the Brazilian announcement should have hadlittle or no effect on prices since the U.S. AgricultureDepartment had pegged the Brazilian crop at 7.5 millionmetric tons, while Licht had estimated it at 8.2 milliontons.   Harry Schwartz, commodity analyst at Cargill InvestorsServices in New York, said he was surprised by the Brazilianauthorization news. &quot;I thought they would make a bearishannouncement like that only in a rising market, never in amarket that had sold off more than 0.70 cent on Thursday andFriday,&quot; he said.   Mr. Schwartz also pointed out that sugar's price declinegained momentum by stop-loss orders that were triggered asthe selling ensued. &quot;If we have a couple of more closes under12 cents, I think that will generate some additionalcomputer-generated selling by funds,&quot; he said.   Arthur Stevenson, sugar analyst at Prudential-BacheSecurities, attributed the market decline to waves oftechnical selling that took out the low prices set four weeksago. He said he would not be surprised to see the market dropto the area of 11.50 cents to 11.25 cents a pound.   Ms. Ganes said that though the crop outlook has improvedand the supply-demand balance is certainly not going to be astight as previously feared, it doesn't mean the market isapproaching a condition of great surplus. &quot;Any problems withproduction and this market could rebound in a hurry,&quot; sheadded.   The new Licht report pointed out that consumption thisyear was kept artificially low in certain countries becauseof tight supplies. It concluded that an increase in output inthose countries does not necessarily mean a sharp addition tostocks, but is likely to go directly into consumption.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Mixed weather forecasts calling forpossible resurgence of cool, moist conditions in some Midwestgrowing regions halted last week's slide in the price of cornfutures contracts. Concern that the weather might hinderpollination of the young crop helped corn futures prices tobounce back. After declining sharply Thursday and Friday, theprice of the December corn contract was up slightlyyesterday. For soybean futures, weather forecasts had lessimpact, as the price of the November contract declined 3.25cents a bushel. That's because the soybean crop has longer todevelop, and any short-term wet weather is less likely todamage it, said Richard Loewy, president of AgResource Co.,Chicago. An additional drain on the price of soybeans iscompetition from growers in South America, he said.                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of pork belly futurescontracts fell the daily limit of two cents a pound yesterdayon higher-than-expected slaughtering of hogs. Traders expecta cold storage report due out today to show lower-than-normalmovement of frozen bellies, which are used to make bacon, outof cold storage, because of the over-supply of fresh belliesfrom slaughter, said Thomas Morgan, president of SterlingResearch, Arlington Heights, Ill. &quot;We think that pork pricesoverall made their highs earlier than normal this year,&quot; Mr.Morgan said. &quot;Normally they peak in July or August, and thisyear we think they peaked in May and June.&quot; Pork pricesbecame so high in those months, he said, that consumersturned away from pork in favor of beef and chicken.                                                                                                          COTTON: Prices continued the sell-off that began lastweek. Yesterday was the last trading day for the expiringJuly contract, which, after setting a high of 92.20 cents apound, closed at 90 cents. Some traders had expected pricefireworks in the expiring contract, but one analystcharacterized the expiration as a non-event. The Octobercontract, which has characteristics of both the old crop andthe new crop, set a high of 79.16 cents for the day and thenreversed direction. It spent most of the day at 76.74 cents,down two cents, the daily limit that cotton prices arepermitted to rise or fall. At the close, it was estimatedthat there were 200 contracts offered at the limit price. Thenew-crop December contract opened in a price range just aboveFriday's close, and then rallied to 74.35 cents beforecommission houses and independent traders forced it down thelimit. It managed to rebound slightly and settle at 71.95cents, down 1.67 cents. Thomas Mueller, cotton specialist atMerrill Lynch Futures in New York, says the market isprobably reacting to forecasts for rain for later in the weekin West Texas, the Delta and the Southeast. He also said thatmany in the market had written off the West Texas crop, butthat he thought it was far too early to take such a stance.&quot;I expect a great Delta crop,&quot; he added.</TEXT></DOC>
