GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   While some demonstrators shout ``Yankeego home,'' vastly more Asians want just the opposite _ a continuedstrong economic and political American presence in their region.   A pervading fear is that the United States indeed might adopt anew isolationist mood, leaving Asia prey to more agressive andmilitary powers.   Despite sharp anti-American protests in South Korea and thePhilippines and festering disputes on trade issues, experts andofficials believe the United States has rarely enjoyed such broadlybased popularity in Asia as it does today.   U.S. and Chinese leaders huddle regularly. Traditionally pricklyrelations with India are on the mend, and onetime enemy Vietnam iskeen to establish diplomatic ties.   On many days Filipino demonstrators are outnumbered by thoselined up at the U.S. Embassy in Manila for visas to emigrate orstudy in the United States.   In Burma, tens of thousands of demonstrators trying to topple anauthoritarian government have applauded the American flag inrallies outside the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon.   Published material and interviews by The Associated Press withofficials in various Asian countries indicate that a largecross-section of Asians are apprehensive that the Soviet Union, andforeseeably China and Japan, would fill the vacuum left by ashrinking U.S. presence.   ``The U.S. role in the western Pacific is vital to the securityand stability of non-communist Asia ... and is very much inSingapore's national interest,'' said Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yewof Singapore. Although speaking shortly after a U.S. diplomat wasexpelled last May for allegedly meddling in Singapore's affairs,Lee described U.S. power as ``benevolent, benign.''   In a sharp turnabout from the Vietnam War era, Americanofficialdom finds itself trying to persuade Asians that the UnitedStates is not becoming isolationist-minded.   ``I think the unease is with American will and commitment: `Doesthe U.S. really have the will to hold tough and stand?''' U.S.Assistant Secretary of State Gaston Sigur said in an interview.   Some senior U.S. foreign policy makers privately expressdisappointment that the United States is not taking full advantageof pro-American sentiments in Asia. They maintain that privateAmerican business doesn't try hard enough in Asian markets, thatU.S. lawmakers create a backlash by pushing protectionist tradelegislation and that Washington doesn't spend enough to promotegeneral American interests.   ``We have to grasp the moment,'' Sigur said.   What also worries Washington is that the two hotbeds ofanti-Americanism in Asia happen to be strategically vital.   In the Philippines, demonstrators demand the ouster of America'slargest military bases outside the continental United States.   In South Korea, radicals blame the division of the Koreanpeninsula on the presence of 42,000 U.S. troops in their country.   ``If Filipinos want to grow up they have to slay the Americanfather image,'' said Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus of thePhilippines. He was referring to the Philippines' former status asa U.S. colony.   Last year, President Corazon Aquino discontinuedPhilippine-American Friendship Day on July 4 as a national holiday.   Analysts generally agree the majority in both the Philippinesand South Korea remain staunchly pro-American but say thissentiment could erode if opponents are effective in propagatingtheir message and moderates find the anti-American themepolitically useful.   Although the United States also stations troops in Japan,irritants in that bilateral relationship are largely economic.   ``Our leverage with Japan is declining so we have to useJapan-bashing to achieve things, and this is causing a backlash,''said Kent Calder, a Japan specialist at Princeton University in theUnited States.   Although he and others characterize all-around ties as sound,Japanese farmers have staged demonstrations and burned anAmerican-made car _ one cattle farmer even committed suicide _ toprotest the opening of their market to far cheaper U.S. beef andoranges. Americans in turn, see Japanese imports swelling analready large U.S. trade deficit.   The U.S. market absorbs more than half the manufactured goods ofnon-communist Southeast Asia. Eastern Asia accounted for $107billion, or 62 percent, of the U.S. trade deficit last year.   Given such high economic stakes, countries such as Taiwan,Indonesia and Thailand can be badly hurt by protectionist U.S.legislation. Conversely, the United States becomes a highly favoredfriend when a country's products flow unhindered into U.S. shoppingmalls and showrooms.   Anti-American feeling appears to be proportional to theintensity of direct U.S. involvement, especially military, in anAsian country.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
