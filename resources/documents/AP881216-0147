(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For 19-year-old Patrina Thomas, gainingcustody of three brothers and a sister will make this Christmasspecial.   The Thomas children lost their mother to a heart attack in 1987,and their father abandoned them this spring when he was arrested ona drug charge.   Ms. Thomas has been taking care of the younger children sincethen by working at a Jacksonville day-care center and supplementingher income with welfare, food stamps and housing assistance.   On Thursday she was awarded custody of Larry, 17, Monique, 13,Reggie, 12, and Derek, 8, in a Duval County Court proceeding.   ``This is my Christmas present,'' said Ms. Thomas.   After living in New York, Ms. Thomas' mother moved the childrento Mississippi a few years ago. When the mother became seriouslyill, their father, Larry Thomas, moved the children to Jacksonville.   The mother died shortly after that.   Ms. Thomas said her father, whom the Veterans Administrationconsiders to be disabled, got an increase in his benefits aftertaking the children. But she said he spent the money on himself,buying drugs.   ``He had us since January of last year, but he hadn't been takingcare of us. He was spending the money on crack (cocaine),'' she said.   The five Thomas children had been living in an apartment withtheir father and his girlfriend. Ms. Thomas was forced to leaveafter arguing with the girlfriend and moved in with a neighbor.However, she still managed to give the younger children school lunchmoney and groceries by working at a fast-food restaurant in theevenings.   In March, their father spent a month in the county jail forcocaine possession and the girlfriend moved out. Neighbor Willie MayEllis moved the children into her apartment until Ms. Thomas wasable to get a subsidized apartment.   All the children are good students, and Reggie is president ofthe teen council at the Teen Alliance Center. Nanelle Lowe, centerdirector, said the children are well-mannered and responsible.   As for Ms. Thomas, ``she carries herself like an older, maturewoman,'' said Ms. Ellis. ``I have older friends who can't cope withwhat she does.''   Ms. Thomas, who graduated from high school in June, hopes tobecome a nurse.   ``I want an education more than anything else. I want them (herbrothers and sister) to go to college. I want to put them throughmyself. I want them to grow up and be strong,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
