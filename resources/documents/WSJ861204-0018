The answers are elusive because dealers give varying responses, and there is no central market quotation system.    The market has been weak since Nov. 14, when arbitrager Ivan Boesky agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge, hand over $100 million and cooperate with investigators. Since then, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been probing, among others, Drexel Burnham Lambert, the junk bond market's driving force and largest dealer.    That has raised questions about whether that inquiry will hinder Drexel's ability to sell the high-risk, high-yield bonds and make markets in them. Some participants used to say Drexel's star junk salesman, Mike Milken, could sell deals at 13% that other brokers would have to offer at 14% or more. More important for corporate raiders, Drexel has been able to line up financing for hostile takeovers much more quickly than other brokers.    Dealers have been playing their cards closer to the vest in the past few days and providing fewer market quotations, possibly to avoid fanning investor fears about the market's direction.    Some say the junk market has only fallen a point or so since the Boesky announcement, while others estimate a decline of three to four points. By comparison, the price of the Treasury bond maturing in November 1996 has risen 1 1/2 points in the same period.    One publicly available barometer, the prices of 52 junk-bond mutual funds, declined by an average of 1.22% between Nov. 13 and Nov. 26, according to Lipper Analytical Services. The Lipper count is based on total return, including dividends.    In the same period, according to Lipper, fixed-income funds of all types rose in value by 0.45%, indicating that junk bond funds lagged the bond market as a whole by almost two percentage points. The 52 junk funds surveyed by Lipper showed results ranging from no change for American Investors Income Fund to a decline of 2.68% for Federated High Yield Trust.    These figures seem consistent with an observation made by many fund managers that the spread between bid and asked prices has widened. While asking prices may not have changed much, bid prices have declined three to four points.    Many junk funds price their shares by estimating a market value somewhere between bid and asked prices, according to Ken Urbaszewski, vice president of Kemper Financial Services, which runs the $163 million Investment Portfolio-High Yield.    Mr. Urbaszewski, whose fund was down 1.2% in the period measured by Lipper, estimated that post-Boesky high-yield prices have declined three to four points, while Treasury bonds have risen two to three points.    The Kemper-run fund has achieved the second best total return so far this year among those on the Lipper list, 17.5%, by avoiding the riskiest, highest-yielding bonds, avoiding oil-company bonds and choosing creditworthy companies in such industries as cable TV.    Officials of the best-performing junk fund so far in 1986, First Investors Special Bond Fund, couldn't be reached for comment. The fund's return: 17.71%.    The worst-performing junk bond fund this year has been Bullock High Income Shares, with a total return of 3.4%. At Bullock, a unit of Equitable Life, most of its portfolio managers were replaced recently by members of another Equitable unit, Alliance Capital Management.    John Fossel, head of mutual funds for Alliance, said Bullock underperformed because it invested in lower-quality paper, which suffered greater price declines this year. For example, he said, the fund owned steel issues such as Newport Steel and Quanex that got hit when LTV made its bankruptcy-law filing.    &quot;Their basic strategy was to find yields whenever they could. They went for super-high yields,&quot; Mr. Fossel said. In many cases, those yields were due not only to extra risk but to the fact the bonds lacked call protection, a valuable feature when the overall bond market is rising. Call protection limits a company's right to refinance a bond if interest rates decline.    The widespread lack of call protection has hurt the overall performance of junk bonds the past five years, despite the perception that they have paid whopping returns. In that same period, Treasury bonds, which have greater call protection, have enjoyed one of their greatest rallies of this century.    According to Drexel, an index of high-yield bonds has lagged the return on the Treasury bond maturing in 2000 in four of the five years. From January 1982 through November 1986, the total return of the Drexel index has been 148.6%, compared with 166.4% for the Treasury bond.    (A spokesman for Drexel points out that higher-grade corporate bonds would have lagged Treasurys for the same reason.)    For the first 11 months of 1986, the Drexel index returned 17.9%, compared with 22.7% for the Treasury bond. For November alone, Drexel's index was down 0.2%, while the Treasury bond was up 2%. </TEXT></DOC>
