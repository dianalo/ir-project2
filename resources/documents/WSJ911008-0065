The Senate is expected to vote today on thenomination of Clarence Thomas to succeed Justice ThurgoodMarshall, who officially retired last week.   The justices added 13 cases to their docket, an unusuallysmall number for the first day of the fall term. Decisions onthose cases are expected next spring. The court declined tohear more than 1,300 other cases, including investor PaulBilzerian's appeal of his 1989 securities-law conviction.                                                                                                          Taxes                                                                                                          In June, the justices agreed to hear a challenge toCalifornia's landmark 1978 property-tax law that had beenbrought by R.H. Macy andamp; Co. But the New York-based retailerdropped its attack, fearing resentment among Californiacustomers.   Undeterred, the Supreme Court said it would hear theappeal of Los Angeles homeowner Stephanie Nordlinger, whoargues that Proposition 13 has created vast tax disparities.The ruling could affect property owners not only inCalifornia, but in a large number of states and counties thathave policies similar to Proposition 13.   In the past, the high court hasn't been eager to strikedown state taxes, only because they affect taxpayersdifferently. But in 1989, the justices overturned a WebsterCounty, W.Va., tax assessment on a coal company, declaringthat the Constitution requires &quot;rough equality&quot; in thetreatment of &quot;similarly situated property owners.&quot;   Proposition 13, an amendment to the state constitution,rolled back property-tax assessments to 1975 levels andlimited annual increases thereafter. Property is reassessedto the current market value when it is sold.   Ms. Nordlinger contends that as a result, Californiacounties now tax newly purchased property as much as 17 timeshigher than similar property held by longtime owners. Shebought her first home in 1988, paying $170,000. Neighbors whobought similar homes in 1975 paid less than one-fourth of the$1,700 in property taxes Ms. Nordlinger paid to Los AngelesCounty in 1989. (Nordlinger vs. Hahn)   In a separate tax matter, the justices said they wouldconsider whether a state may force a mail-order retailerbased in another state to collect use taxes from consumers.   The issue has tremendous economic implications. Stateslose more than $2.2 billion annually in use-tax revenue,because direct marketers refuse to collect such levies,according to lawyers for state governments. Use taxes, whichmost states impose on products not covered by state salestaxes, not only raise revenue, but also give a boost to localretailers that are subject to sales taxes.   In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled that a state may force anout-of-state mail-order firm to collect a use tax fromcustomers only if the firm has a &quot;physical presence&quot; in thestate. Since then, mail-order retailers have avoided use-taxliability by limiting their contacts to mailing catalogs,making phone calls or using common carriers. But as thedirect-marketing industry has expanded, a number of stateshave amended their use-tax laws to apply to mail-order firmsthat regularly solicit sales in the states. The high court'sdecision will determine the validity of those amended laws.   The justices will review North Dakota's effort to forceQuill Corp., a Lincolnshire, Ill., office-products supplier,to collect a use tax on merchandise sold to consumers in thestate. The North Dakota Supreme Court ruled that the taxdidn't violate constitutional protections of interstatecommerce or &quot;due process&quot; of law.   Quill, which has no facilities or employees in NorthDakota, argued in its appeal that the tax is invalid underthe high court's 1967 ruling. The firm noted that other statecourts recently have followed the 1967 precedent. Groupsrepresenting retailers and direct-marketers filed briefsbacking the firm.   North Dakota, with the support of 22 other states,countered that the growth of direct marketing, as well as theuse of new computerized technologies, have rendered the 1967precedent obsolete. (Quill vs. North Dakota)   In tandem with the North Dakota case, the justices saidthey will consider a dispute over the interpretation of afederal law that prevents states from taxing the income ofout-of-state companies that merely solicit purchase ordersin-state. The case involves Wisconsin's attempt to tax partof the income of Wrigley Co., the Illinois-based chewing-gumgiant. The case covers the 1973 to 1978 tax years andinvolves a total of $272,000 in disputed taxes and penalties.   Wrigley sells gum in Wisconsin, and Wrigleyrepresentatives solicit orders there as well. The Wisconsinrevenue department attempted to apply a franchise tax on partof Wrigley's income, arguing that the firm's activities wentbeyond mere sales and solicitation. The Wisconsin SupremeCourt ruled that under the federal tax law, Wrigley'sactivities in the state didn't go beyond &quot;solicitation oforders.&quot; The revenue department appealed that decision.(Wisconsin Department of Revenue vs. Wrigley Co.)   In the area of individual income tax, the justices agreedto decide whether damages awarded for back pay inemployment-discrimination lawsuits are taxable income. Thehigh court will review an April ruling by the federal appealscourt in Cincinnati that such damages, awarded under TitleVII of the federal Civil Rights Act, aren't taxable. TheJustice Department appealed to the Supreme Court, arguingthat the case would affect thousands of people who havereceived, or will receive, back-pay awards. (U.S. vs. Burke)                                                                                                          Antitrust                                                                                                          The high court agreed to re-examine the question of when astate's regulation of an industry, in effect, immunizes firmsin that industry from federal antitrust laws.   In 1943, the justices ruled that when a state clearlyintends to regulate an industry rather than allow freecompetition, and when the state &quot;actively supervises&quot;industry conduct, private businesses are immune from federalantitrust enforcement.   The case the justices agreed to consider involves five ofthe country's largest titlesearch companies. Such firms,commonly hired by real estate buyers, research land titlesfor defects such as prior liens or restrictions on how theland may be used. The five companies -- Ticor Insurance Co.,Chicago Title Insurance Co., Security Union Title InsuranceCo., Lawyers Title Insurance Corp. and Stewart Title GuarantyCo. -- set standard prices for their services in a number ofstates by means of private &quot;rating bureaus.&quot;   The FTC charged that the companies were illegally fixingprices and ordered them to stop. The companies claimed thatthe rating bureaus operated under state supervision and wereimmune from federal antitrust enforcement. A federal appealscourt in Philadelphia reversed the FTC order, ruling that aslong as some basic level of state activity occurs, regardlessof how effective, the companies are immune. The FTC appealedthat decision. (FTC vs. Ticor Title Insurance Co.)   In other cases, the high court:   -- Declined to intervene in a lawsuit brought by blackwould-be home buyers against The New York Times. Theplaintiffs accuse the newspaper of violating a federalanti-discrimination law by publishing real estate display adsthat exclude black models. The Times, which is published byNew York Times Co., sought to have the suit dismissed beforetrial. But two lower courts ruled that it could proceed. (NewYork Times Co. vs. Ragin)   -- Let stand an appeals-court reversal of a $5.3 millionlibel verdict against General Electric Corp.'s NationalBroadcasting Co. unit for a report on entertainer WayneNewton's alleged ties to organized-crime figures. (Newton vs.National Broadcasting Co.)   -- Declined to review a lower-court ruling thatmanufacturers of the anti-miscarriage drugdiethylstilbestrol, or DES, shouldn't be held liable forinjuries suffered by the grandchildren of women who took thedrug. (Enright vs. Eli Lilly andamp; Co.)   -- Refused to consider an appeals court decision affirmingthe federal licensing of the controversial Seabrook, N.H.,nuclear power plant. (Massachusetts vs. Nuclear RegulatoryCommission)   -- Let stand a lower-court ruling that now-defunct EasternAirlines should have reinstated striking pilots who wanted toreturn to work before it hired trainees as replacementpilots. (Eastern Airlines Inc. vs. Airline PilotsAssociation)   -- Refused to hear the Federal Election Commission'sappeal of a ruling that it lacks authority to bar use ofcorporate or union general treasury funds for politicaladvocacy on particular issues, such as abortion. (FEC vs.Faucher)   -- Let stand a lower-court ruling that the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission has the authority to regulate the ratesthat natural-gas companies charge for drawing gas from theearth for the purpose of transporting it.
