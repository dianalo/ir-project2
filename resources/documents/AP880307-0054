Manuel Antonio Noriega if the military leader didn't step down.   Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for the Panama Canal Commission saidships were passing normally through the waterway despite reportsthat the nation's crisis was holding up passage of ships throughthe canal.   About 300 retirees, chanting ``Justice,'' were joined by scoresof younger supporters who cut off traffic on the city's mainAvenida Espana in front of the towering National Bank of Panamabuilding.   ``We little old people don't have that much strength, but we'llhold out here as long as we can,'' said Violeta Sanchez, 63, aretired secretary.   At least 200 more retirees gathered in front of the TreasuryMinistry to demonstrate.   Noriega's regime, under increasing pressure from the UnitedStates, tried to assure the country's 60,000 retirees over theweekend that they would be able to cash their pension checks forthe first two weeks of March. But it did not say how or where, andthe pensioners were indignant.   Rafael Arosemena, president of the National Bank, came out ofthe building to try to placate the retirees, and was surrounded byan antagonistic crowd. He told them they should go to anotherbranch, but they refused to do so.   Later in the morning, the government radio station said theNational Bank would set up two payment booths in the afternoon tocash retirement checks.   Banks fearing a run because of political instability closed lastweek.   The government blames the closures on lack of funds resultingfrom the freezing of Panamanian government money deposited in fiveU.S. banks.   Panama's official currency is the U.S. dollar, and thegovernment periodically receives shipments of tender from the U.S.banks where it keeps an estimated $50 million on deposit.   A request for such a shipment last week was rejected because oflegal action taken on behalf of Eric Arturo Delvalle, who wasousted from the presidency on Feb. 26.   Panama Canal Commission spokesman Willie Friar said the rumorsthat ship traffic through the canal was being disrupted began withunconfirmed reports that Panamanian port authorities _ which havebeen independent from the Canal Commission since 1979 _ wereaccepting payment only in cash.   She said other forms of payment were being accepted for portservices such as bunkering _ taking on fuel or water.   She also said the great majority of the three dozen vessels thatmake the passage on an average day do not use the port facilities.   She said all 38 vessels scheduled to make the passage Sunday didso, and that the 39 scheduled to pass through today were proceedingnormally without delay.   On Sunday, Roderick Esquivel, Panama's ousted vice president,said from hiding that if Noriega does not relinquish power,Panamanians should take up arms against him.   In an interview with The Associated Press from a house where hewas staying, Esquivel warned Sunday:   ``If peaceful means and the economic measures are not sufficientto achieve democracy, then I am the first to say that democracymust be obtained by fighting for it.''   Esquivel was ousted from office in a military-orchestrated coupon Feb. 26 along with Delvalle, who also remains in hiding. The twomen were removed from their posts a day after Delvalle tried tofire Noriega.   ``Many people think Panama does not have much capacity forviolence, but it does,'' he said.   The Education Ministry postponed the start of public schoolclasses until further notice. Teachers were to have returned toschool from vacation today for a week of preparation, with studentsbeginning classes March 14. The ministry said in a statement thepostponement was due to the climate of crisis.   Panama's 12 local banks have been shuttered since last Tuesday.Branches of international institutions closed their doors on Friday.   The National Bank of Panama said it could not supply its memberbanks with tender and instructed them on Friday to remain closeduntil further notice.   People have not been able to cash checks since Feb. 29, andstores have stopped accepting checks and credit cards.   ``The entire population is prepared to suffer economichardship,'' Esquivel said of mounting economic pressure fromWashington. ``And in a second phase, they are ready to sacrificetheir lives.''</TEXT></DOC>
