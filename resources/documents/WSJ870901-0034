But there are now, and during the three-week strike by black miners that ended Sunday, his dictum posed one dilemma after another for Anglo American's present management.    Profits dictated that the company hold firm on its wage offer to the National Union of Mineworkers, but general benefit said give in. Profits warranted a stronger security force in the mines, general benefit cautioned go easy. Profits said fire striking miners and hire new ones, general benefit counseled against it.    As Anglo's senior management gathered daily to wrestle with these contradictions, Mr. Oppenheimer's words kept coming back like a nightmare. Recalling these discussions after the strike ended, Zach de Beer, an Anglo director, arches his eyebrows and sighs, &quot;What do we do?&quot;    What Anglo did was come down on the side of profits; after all, Sir Ernest did say &quot;always.&quot; The company forced the union to give up the strike and accept a sobering setback. Anglo, and its fellow mine owners, won the test of strength posed by the strike. But it also lost something precious: the shine on the company image.    &quot;A facade&quot; is how Cyril Ramaphosa, the head of the miners' union, describes Anglo's self-portrait of liberalism and benevolence toward its black workers. He acknowledges that Anglo did more than any other mining house to foster the growth of unionism on the mines, but he says its actions in the strike were those of a union buster.    Academic observers of Anglo also say the strike showed the company's true colors. Duncan Innes, a senior lecturer in industrial sociology at Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand and author of a book on Anglo, says that by firing workers in a legal strike, &quot;Anglo ultimately fell back on a piece of apartheid legislation set up to smash the unions.&quot; (Under South Africa's labor law, the miners' strike was legal. But another law gives employers the right to fire workers who don't report to work, including strikers.)    Many South African companies are forced to balance the often conflicting goals of satisfying shareholders and acting socially responsible to the black community -- none more than Anglo.    As South Africa's largest and most powerful company -- its subsidiaries dominate the mining, manufacturing, publishing, finance and real-estate sectors -- Anglo is the ultimate symbol of capitalism, which is a dirty word for many blacks. Over the years, it has also presented an easy target for charges that it has benefited most from the country's system of racial segregation. Indeed, some of these are on the mark: Contrary to the Oppenheimer philosophy, Anglo's mines richly exploited apartheid's black-migrant labor system.    Displaying a sensitivity to such criticism, Anglo has been striving hard to polish its image. Many of its executives are ardent opponents of the government; some of them have even met with the anti-apartheid, and banned, African National Congress. It has been one of the most aggressive companies in wiping out workplace segregation, and it has taken the lead among the mining houses in improving living conditions at the mines. Its Chairman's Fund distributes the equivalent of more than $15 million annually to projects aimed at improving black education and community life.    &quot;Some of us understand all too well the frustration and sense of deprivation that the black segment of the population feels,&quot; says Mr. de Beer. &quot;That's one of the reasons why the strike was so painful.&quot;    On the issue of wages, Anglo and the other mining houses refused to accept the union's demand for a 30% across-the-board raise and instead unilaterally implemented increases of 15% to 23%, depending on skill level. Anglo officials concede that it wasn't a matter of being unable to afford the union demand, nor was it that the workers didn't deserve it (unskilled miners earn less than $9 a day). It's just that the time had come to hold the line on pay increases in an industry where the price of the main product, gold and other precious metals, can fluctuate wildly, they say.    As for tightening security at the struck mines, Mr. de Beer says the crowded hostels where the men live breed confrontation, particularly during times of tension, such as a strike. When fights broke out between the miners -- several were killed -- mine security moved in.    &quot;No matter how great one's sympathies are {about not using force}, one can't stand by and allow murders in the hostels, which we had,&quot; says Mr. de Beer.    The hardest call was the one to begin firing strikers. &quot;When do you start firing workers in a legal strike? Nobody has an answer to this,&quot; says Mr. de Beer. The company says its &quot;economic interests&quot; led it to begin at the end of the second week, although no one at the company will explain the timing. In all, about 40,000 miners were dismissed and sent home, most of whom Anglo says will be rehired.    &quot;I have no doubt that union members feel pretty bitter about this,&quot; Mr. de Beer concedes. &quot;It was the most painful decision we had to make.&quot;    Anglo hopes the strike will lead to easier labor relations. But it is likely the pain will only grow. For one thing, the unions remain the only legitimate means of political expression for the disenfranchised blacks. For another, the fact that the mineworkers sustained a strike for three weeks against the mighty mining industry seems to have increased their appetite for confrontation.    Mr. Ramaphosa calls this year's strike a &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for 1988.    &quot;These are the realities of South Africa,&quot; says Mr. de Beer. His eyebrows arch once again. &quot;What do we do?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
