The new creditors' committee includes representatives of theMachinists union and pilots union at Miami-based Eastern, as well asa representative of non-union employees, most of whom were laid offfollowing the strike.   The Machinists struck the airline on March 4 after 17 months ofwrangling with management over a contract. The pilots' support forthe walkout virtually grounded Eastern and forced it to file forprotection from its creditors on March 9 under Chapter 11 of theFederal Bankruptcy Act.   The Eastern pilots are owed more than $500 million in back payand other claims, said Ron Cole, a spokesman in Miami for the AirLine Pilots Association.   The creditors' committee has the right to review anyreorganization plan proposed by Eastern and can propose its own planto the bankruptcy judge.   In Houston, officials of Eastern's sister carrier ContinentalAirlines preparing for heavy Easter travel dismissed the effects ofa flight attendants' strike. They said the walkout is not disturbingservice despite union claims of delays and cancellations.   Continental officials say the strike was called at the behest ofEastern Machinists. Both Eastern and Continental are owned byHouston-based Texas Air Corp.   Lewis Jordan, Continental's chief operating officer and executivevice president, provided a chart indicating the carrier has had anaverage 27 daily cancellations out of 1,400 flights daily for aboutthree weeks before the strike and an average of 12 cancellationsdaily on Monday and Tuesday.   ``And not one of those cancellations is as a result of a shortageof a flight attendant or crew member,'' Jordan said.   Philip Hobbs, a spokesman for the flight attendants union,however, contradicted Jordan's statistics and insisted there havebeen numerous cancellations and delays caused by the walkout.   Continental and union officials differ drastically on the numberof attendants not reporting to work.   Hobbs said between 1,200 and 1,300 attendants have walked off thejob, while Continental said only 180 were striking.   A federal appeals court in New York, meanwhile, refused to letcommuter railroad workers cripple Northeast rail transit by honoringEastern Machinists' picket lines.   The unionized rail workers wanted the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals to allow them to strike in sympathy with Eastern workers.But the appeals court refused to lift a lower court's bar on suchstrikes.</TEXT></DOC>
