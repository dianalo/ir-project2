Malawi President Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who is in his 80s,kissed the British leader's hand as she curtsied to him in adeparture ceremony at Chileka airport near the commercial capitalof Blantyre.   Thatcher's destination was kept secret, evidently for securityreasons, but she arrived shortly after noon today in Windhoek,Namibia, on the first day of that southwest African territory'sprocess toward independence from South African control. Among thoseshe was expected to meet was South African Foreign Minister PikBotha.   On her current African swing, the British premier has visitedMorocco, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Malawi.   On each leg of the tour she has expressed hope that conditionsare right for a negotiated end to conflict in Southern Africa withBritain playing a role in any possible political breakthrough inwhite-ruled South Africa.   At a banquet hosted by Banda at his hilltop palace outsideBlantyre late Friday, Thatcher said she was visiting a continenttorn by strife but she came ``with the conviction that this is thetime of new hope for Southern Africa''.   She cited the U.N-supervised independence plan for Namibiastarting today as evidence of a conciliatory mood in the regionwhich secured a timetable for the withdrawal of Cuban troops fromAngola, Namibia's northern neighbor, and South Africa's withdrawalfrom Namibia.   Thatcher said within South Africa itself, ``one sees a growingacceptance that discrimination based on race and color must end andwill end, that black South Africans must be allowed to play theirpart in politics and government.''   Britain has said it is prepared assist in mediation efforts inSouth Africa on condition jailed African National Congress leaderNelson Mandela is released first and that the guerrilla leaderrenounces violence.   Thatcher has argued that Britain has unique expertise based onexperience gained from relinquising power in its former Africancolonies, particularly Zimbabwe.   An all-party conference chaired by Britian in 1979 ended aseven-year guerrilla war in white-ruled Rhodesia and led to thebirth of the independent nation of Zimbabwe the following year.   On her African tour, Thatcher has restated he opposition to aneconomic blockade of South Africa, contending that sanctions wouldhurt South Africa's 28 million blacks the most.   In Namibia, ``now there must be free and fair elections justlike those which Britain organized in Zimbabwe nine years ago,''she said.   Thatcher was expected to hold talks with United Nationsofficials in Namibia later today and visit British troops in a U.N.peacekeeping force in the territory which has been controlled bySouth Africa since World War 1.</TEXT></DOC>
