Boesky said that he conducted numerousillegal securities trades with defendant John A. Mulheren Jr.and that Mr. Mulheren proposed a bogus scheme to compensateMr. Boesky for profits on those trades.   Michael Davidoff's testimony provided the most damagingevidence yet in the government's case against Mr. Mulheren,former chief of Jamie Securities Co. Mr. Davidoff appeared tohelp the government much more than did his former boss, Mr.Boesky, who testified last week.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Mulheren is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy,securities fraud and keeping false records in connection withhis dealings with Mr. Boesky.   Appearing nervous and speaking with a slight stammer, Mr.Davidoff recalled a series of trades with Mr. Mulheren thatMr. Davidoff said were designed to generate tax losses forMr. Boesky's trading company and to help evade net capitalrequirements.   Mr. Davidoff, 46 years old, said the trades with Mr.Mulheren, which Mr. Davidoff said he believed to be illegalat the time he did them, began in July 1985 and continueduntil March of the following year. Mr. Davidoff said heconducted the trades at Mr. Boesky's direction. Mr. Davidoff,once Mr. Boesky's chief trader, pleaded guilty in 1987 to onefelony count related to securities fraud and is awaitingsentencing.   In every case, Mr. Davidoff said, Mr. Boesky's companyagreed to sell securities to Mr. Mulheren's firm with theunderstanding that those securities would later berepurchased. Mr. Davidoff said he repeatedly assured Mr.Mulheren that all profits and losses from the trades &quot;wouldbe borne by&quot; Mr. Boesky's company.   Mr. Davidoff said the first of these trades with Mr.Mulheren involved stock of Unocal Corp. and was arranged byMr. Boesky himself. Mr. Davidoff said he did the trade withMr. Boesky after talking with him. Shown records of the tradeby assistant U.S. attorney Alfred Pavlis, Mr. Davidoffacknowledged it was his handwriting on the documents.   Mr. Davidoff said that Mr. Mulheren later agreed to buysecurities in five other companies with the understandingJamie Securities would sell these securities back to Mr.Boesky at a later date and be compensated for any losses. ByDecember 1985, Mr. Davidoff said, Jamie Securities owed Mr.Boesky's firm &quot;over $1 million&quot; from profits that Jamie madeon the trades.   According to Mr. Davidoff's testimony, Mr. Mulherenproposed a scheme where Jamie would inflate brokerage billsit paid to Mr. Boesky's trading company in late 1985. But inMarch 1986, when Mr. Boesky wanted to speed up the payments,Mr. Davidoff said that he agreed with Mr. Mulheren that Jamiewould sell Mr. Boesky securities at below-market prices,resulting in a profit to Mr. Boesky.   Mr. Davidoff is expected to continue his testimony todayand will likely be cross-examined by Thomas Puccio, anattorney for Mr. Mulheren.</TEXT></DOC>
