It was foundthat in this system gold dissolves rather rapidly when anodically polarized,so that with 30 min of electrolysis one can obtain solutions with a metalconcentration of over 70 mg/liter. The iodide ions present in the solutionare responsible for this process, as they can be oxidized at potentialsabove 0.5 V (nhe) and enter redox reactions with the gold. The anodicgold dissolution is slower when glycine is present, which can be attributedto glycine adsorption on the gold electrode occurring under the conditionsstudied.</TEXT></DOC>
