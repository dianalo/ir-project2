They say many arrive with forgeddocuments in an effort to support their claims for political asylum.   ``A few hundred Chileans a year came to Sweden at the beginningof the 1980's,'' said Mats Baurmann, a Swedish immigrationofficial. ``Last year 4,000 applied for political asylum. Most ofthem came for economic reasons.''   Economic reasons are not enough for an alien to stay in Swedenor Norway, whose officials are concerned that their liberal refugeepolicies are being abused.   The problem also involves nationalities other than Chileans, butit is particularly acute among Chileans wanting to join the 17,000other Chileans who have immigrated as long ago as 1973 when Gen.Augusto Pinochet took power at the head of a military government inSantiago.   About 18,000 people applied for asylum in Sweden last year.About 14,000 were accepted, but most of their applications had beenpending for at least a year. Altogether Sweden had 37,000immigrants in 1987, said the goverment's Immigration Agency.   The Swedish government reportedly is considering tightening itsimmigration laws, similar to legislation adopted by Norway in Junerequiring all visiting Chileans, starting July 1, to obtain entryvisas in advance of arrival.   Norwegian officials, rejecting claims that their move reflecteda wave of anti-immigration sentiment among voters, said they wantedonly to sift out actual political refugees from the growing tide ofpeople seeking to improve their economic well being.   Annette Thomessen, head of the Norwegian Organization for AsylumSeekers, said in Oslo that she supported the new regulations.   She claimed that some travel agents in Chile promise jobs andhousing to those who buy tickets to Norway.   ``But when they arrive here they get nothing,'' she said.``Instead they are sent back deeply in debt.''   Neighboring Denmark, which also has a relaxed immigrationpolicy, has registered no significant increase of requests forasylum from Chileans, a Justice Ministry spokesman in Cophenhagensaid.   Baurmann, the Swedish official, said most of the Chileanapplicants come from poor areas of their country. They borrow frombanks or from relatives to pay the return ticket, which they needto enter Sweden without a visa, he added.   ``They arrive saying they are tourists, but after a while theyapply for political asylum,'' Baurmann told The Associated Press.   Baurmann confirmed Swedish press reports that a would-beimmigrant can buy a forged document in Chile that testifies that heor she is a victim of political persecution. The documents usuallybear the signature of a purported priest, politician or humanrights representative, he said.   The Dagens Nyheter newspaper quoted Luis Bork, the head of theHuman Rights Commission in the Chilean city of Valparaiso, assaying: ``I have seen my name on more than 200 forged documents.   ``We categorically oppose this kind of exile. People should stayhere and fight for democracy. Only if the person is threatened byjail or death do we help.''   Baurmann said most documents presented by Chileans are authenticbut are signed by people without authority or credibility.   Swedish authorities ``do not deny that there is politicaloppression in Chile,'' but Sweden's rules must be tightened, hesaid.   About 65 percent of the Chileans coming to Sweden are allowed tostay, even though many are rejected for asylum, he said.   Processing an application can take up to two years, while livingexpenses are paid by the government. Even if an applicant is deniedasylum, ``many of them get rooted in Sweden'' and eventually areallowed to stay, said Baurmann.   Anita Doratio, head of the Swedish Organizations for AsylumSeekers told the national radio that it would be ``cynical'' totighten the rules.   She argued that Swedes were not turned away when poverty forced1 million of them to emigrate to the United States 100 years ago.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed AMs, July 13</NOTE></DOC>
