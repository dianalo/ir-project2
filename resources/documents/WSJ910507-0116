Richard Springwater, vice president of AMB Corporate RealEstate Advisors, San Francisco, puts it this way: &quot;You canlay off people, but in a lot of markets you can't lay offspace.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   A case in point is Western Digital Corp., a computer-chipand disk-drive maker, which is paying $600,000 a year foroffice space it no longer needs. Since October, the companyhas reduced the work force at its Irvine, Calif.,headquarters by 200 through layoffs and attrition. Theproblem is that officials haven't been able to sublease thespace the departed workers left behind.   To Western Digital, now restructuring $165 million in debtwith its lenders, every penny counts. The $600,000 it spendsto lease the unneeded space &quot;is a lot of money,&quot; says RobertErickson, vice president of law and administration. &quot;Andthat's not including maintenance.&quot;   Such damage is becoming increasingly apparent as layoffsand other restructuring force companies to meet head-on thereality of a national office market that is running anaverage 20% vacancy rate in major cities.   Dealing with too much office space isn't a new problem.But corporate real-estate specialists say the business ofsubleasing the extra space or terminating unwanted long-termlease obligations has become costlier than ever because ofthe prolonged office glut. Moreover, the proliferation ofcorporate restructurings and layoffs is further pressuringalready fragile real-estate markets and rents.   &quot;I know of individual companies with more than $100million in {total} potential exposure from unleasedfacilities,&quot; says Stephen E. Roulac, managing partner of theRoulac Group of Deloitte andamp; Touche, the big accounting andconsulting firm.   Analysts say rising corporate real-estate costs to coverlease payments and maintenance represent a hidden liabilityon corporate financial statements, and many companies declineto specify their losses from the problem. On average,however, the annual cost of holding vacant office space runsabout $4,000 per departed worker, according to Michael A.Bell, vice president of LaSalle Partners, a Chicago-basedreal-estate consulting firm. Mr. Bell's formula assumes thatoffice space costs an average of $18 a square foot a year andthat each worker requires an average 220 square feet.   BankAmerica Corp. is still feeling the effects of excessspace six years after it began cutting its work force to thecurrent level of 55,000 people world-wide from 85,000. TheBank of America parent was left with six million square feetof vacant space, out of which it has been able to sell orsublease all but 700,000 square feet, says Daniel W.Costello, executive vice president of the corporatereal-estate division.   Mr. Costello says, &quot;I know that we're losing money&quot; on theremaining vacant space, which under the LaSalle formula iscosting BankAmerica $12.6 million a year. But he says thecosts are more than offset by the company's savings in nothaving to pay about $900 million in salaries for the 30,000eliminated positions.   Recent layoffs have left 3Com Corp., a Santa Clara,Calif., computer concern, with 110,000 square feet of extraoffice space, a $2 million annual drag on earnings under theLaSalle formula. &quot;I'd rather be on the side of needing morespace,&quot; says Christopher Paisley, 3Com's chief financialofficer.   Another Silicon Valley company, IntelliCorp Inc., lastmonth took a $4.4 million restructuring charge that includes&quot;accrual of anticipated losses from the prospective subleaseof idle space in our headquarters building&quot; from a recent 25%work-force reduction. The artificial-intelligence concerndeclined to elaborate.   In New York, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. is still dealing with thereal-estate aftershocks of the October 1987 stock-marketcrash. The company vacated 495,000 square feet of officespace in its World Financial Center headquarters after thecrash. Only recently did it find a tenant to sublet 325,000square feet of the space, and 170,000 square feet is stillavailable. A spokeswoman says Merrill accounted for expectedcosts from the vacant space as part of a a $470 millionrestructuring charge it took two years ago. Despite recentfurther deterioration in the New York City office market, shesays the excess space is having &quot;no current impact.&quot;   Similarly, Union Carbide Corp. still has 150,000 squarefeet of vacant office space at its world headquarters inDanbury, Conn., left over from layoffs initiated in the wakeof the 1984 gas disaster at its plant in Bhopal, India. Thechemical company was able to sublease an additional 100,000square feet at the facility, but a spokesman says &quot;my guess&quot;is that Union Carbide is losing money on the arrangement.Making matters worse, the company has 15 years left on itsDanbury lease.   Of course, the wealth of space means that companieslooking to expand ought to be able to strike a bargain.Compared with the regular office market, subleasing offers25% to 50% cheaper rates, says Marty Irving, head of theIrving Group consulting firm in Tysons Corner, Va. Anotherbenefit is a shorter-term commitment.   Other companies are successfully negotiating cancellationclauses or renewable yearly options on long-term leases, saysDouglas D. Abbey, a principal with AMB Corporate Real EstateAdvisors.   Such defensive thinking only makes sense, says AMB's Mr.Springwater. &quot;For a lot of companies,&quot; he says, &quot;taking adefensive real-estate position means talking frankly aboutthe possibility that projections won't be met.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
