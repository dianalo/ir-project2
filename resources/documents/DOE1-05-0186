The FY 1986 budget of the Ministry of International Tradeand Industry for the technological development concerning the prospectingof the geothermal energy is 634,802,000 yen in the general account and5,341,565,000yen in the special account, titling 5,976,367,000yen, 96%of the previous year. This report collects and summarizes the researchobjectives and the outlines of the researches in FY 1986 with respectto 5 projects about the evaluation technology of the geothermal resourcesin Japan, etc. as the technological development concerning the geothermalenergy prospecting, 3 projects about the research and development ofthe technology for preventing the water leakage in geothermal wells,etc. as the technological development about extraction of the geothermalenergy and 9 projects about the development of a 10MW class binary cyclepower plant, etc. as the technological development related to the utilizationof the geothermal energy.
