After double-digit gains from stock and bond funds the past several years, even paltry returns were reason to cheer last year. The average general equity fund inched up 1.5% through Dec. 23, while Standard andamp; Poor's 500-index, including reinvested dividends, rose 7.2% in the same period. Fixed-income funds edged 0.62% higher.    &quot;Most mutual fund investors are in a bad mood --they're frustrated&quot; from the year's market shocks, said Kurt Brouwer, a San Francisco money manager. Many equity funds fared even worse than broad market averages, despite diversified portfolios that many had hoped would stem severe losses.    As a result, investors withdrew more money than ever before from long-term funds. Through November, redemptions from stock, bond and income funds totaled $107 billion, nearly double those of a year earlier, according to the Investment Company Institute, a trade group. For all of 1986, redemptions were $68 billion.    Bond fund investors were the most fickle, with heavy redemptions both in the spring and early autumn, when interest rates climbed before the October stock market crash. The steepest equity-fund withdrawals occurred in October, of course, after the stock market crashed.    Still, most of that money remained in fund families as investors flocked to the safety of short-term money market accounts, particularly later in the year. &quot;Investors were moving money into liquid assets,&quot; said Alfred P. Johnson, ICI vice president and chief economist.    One of those investors was Parker Bartlett, a retired Santa Monica, Calif., aerospace equipment executive. He switched nine of his 10 stock funds into money markets accounts after his $600,000 of holdings plunged 30% Black Monday. Mr. Bartlett currently has about $5,000 left in one equity fund --and he isn't sure what he will do with the rest of his money. &quot;I'm more inclined to go into individual blue chips rather than move it back into mutual funds,&quot; he said.    Meantime, mutual fund professionals say investors shouldn't expect strong returns this year. &quot;Nineteen eighty-eight will be the year of modest expectations,&quot; said John LaPorte, research director at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Baltimore. Added Mr. Brouwer, the money manager: &quot;The new game for investors will be to hold on to what they have.&quot;    The same can be said for fund companies, many of which haven't yet been hit that hard. While sales have slumped and fund assets have declined about 10% since their August peak of nearly $850 billion, assets still remain 8% higher than a year ago.    Thus, the big layoffs hitting Wall Street financial services firms have been averted at most fund management concerns, although many positions are being re-evaluated, officials say. One exception, Ivy Financial Services Inc., a Hingham, Mass., family of five funds, has laid off 14%, or five of its small work force, including two salesmen and a trader.    The stock market crash also has yet to spark any mutual fund failures. One fund that has disbanded, Westergaard Fund Inc., which invested in small growth companies, announced plans to liquidate in September before the market debacle.    Some executives contend that fund companies can grow --even with no net new sales of general mutual funds to investors. Steady growth in retirement funds and reinvested dividends could keep larger companies healthy if redemptions are held down, some argue. &quot;The regular cash flow from accounts is a pretty powerful force even when you can't sell funds,&quot; said Steven Norwitz, a vice president at T. Rowe Price.    Whatever happens, investors continue to have a broader selection from which to choose. More than 400 new funds hit the market last year, bringing the total to more than 2,300, according to the ICI. At the same time, nearly three dozen closed-end funds were launched.    Still, the growth has slowed since the crash. Just 18 new funds registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in November --less than half the number filed in August, according to Charles E. Simon andamp; Co., a Washington research company. And Black Monday has indefinitely set back several planned launches of closed-end funds.    Any new growth is expected to be primarily in international funds, which take advantage of a weaker U.S. dollar, fund officials say. There also likely will be more emphasis on asset-allocation funds --those that can shift from one investment market to another.    Until the dust settles in the markets, many mutual fund holders will be hunkering down. &quot;We'll see a little more rationality and conservatism by investors,&quot; said John Bogle, chairman of the Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa.    The best places to be in 1987 were gold and international funds, which dominated the top 10 funds monitored by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. Both benefited from the persistent drop in the U.S. dollar. The big winner, however, was the Oppenheimer 90-10Fund, which before the crash invested in put options on Standard andamp; Poor's 100-index, in effect betting that the market as a whole would drop.    Bringing up the rear were utilities and small-company growth funds, which were affected severely by the stock market crash. And the fund family with the best chance for 1988's comeback-of-the-year award is 44 Wall St., whose 44 Wall St. Equity and 44 Wall St. funds snared two of 1987's bottom four spots.    Most investors in publicly traded commodity funds enjoyed a banner year. The average commodity fund --which offers limited partnership units in pools of professionally managed futures trading money --rose nearly 27% through November, according to Managed Account Reports, Columbia, Md. Most futures-fund managers are technical trend followers who were aided by strong sustained movements in stock-index and currency futures for much of the year.    ---           How Different Types of Mutual Funds Fared                                     % Change      % Change                                     12/31/86-     12/31/85-                                     12/23/87      12/31/86    Option growth                     +39.01        +11.65    Gold                              +34.08        +36.07    World income                      +17.47          N.A.
