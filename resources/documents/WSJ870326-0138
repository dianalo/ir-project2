The yen would be held at about 150, the mark around 1.8. By this past Tuesday, a weakening dollar had driven the yen to 148.85. It was time for the six to do their thing.    So on Tuesday the Fed, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England entered the exchange markets to support the dollar. Yesterday there were reports that the Bundesbank entered the lists, but the yen still finished the day in New York at about 149.    As currently perceived, this is the way exchange-rate stabilization is supposed to work. Japan, whose currency was falling most abruptly out of line with the dollar, was supposed to buy dollars with yen. Also, as a longer-term project, it is supposed to make more use of the dollars it already owns, by buying someone else's goods. However, exchange speculators want another key piece of information: Did any of the central banks &quot;sterilize&quot; dollar-buying by tightening up overall creation of currency? Did the Japanese, with the tacit approval of their partners who've done the same thing themselves, decline to accept the intervention's expansion of yen and siphon currency out of the internal Japanese market? Is the Fed helping at its end by creating fewer dollars?    If key countries merely sterilize their market interventions, they have little chance of stabilizing rates. They will continue to suffer destructive, volatile dislocations in exchange rates. The leadership gathered at the Louvre will be charged with a lack of discipline. The credibility of its commitment to stopping the dollar's fall will evaporate. Much-needed growth in the dollar-surplus nations of Germany and Japan won't soon occur. Trade frictions will heat up further.    If on the other hand this week's actions mean the interventionists are now willing to link overall monetary policy to price signals and the need for exchange-rate stability, the events of the past few days will be an important first step toward real growth in the world economy. </TEXT></DOC>
