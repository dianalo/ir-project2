It is shown that the presene of sufficiently fastflows leads to the appearance of a number of novel effects: the productionof negative energy waves, reversal of the sign of radiative damping,development of explosive instability in the nonlinear stage and to thedevelopment of coarse (linear) hydrodynamic instability when the velocityexceeds the upper threshold. The corresponding processes are classifiedand examples are presented of a calculation of the increments for dissipativeinstabilities related to the emission of sound waves and anomalous absorptionin the resonance layer. The conditions for the existence of explosiveinstability are elucidated.</TEXT></DOC>
