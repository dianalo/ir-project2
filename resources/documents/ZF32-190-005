(Good Ideas) (column)andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>More Tips on Using Lotus ProductsandM;Maximum argumentsandM;in @functionsandM;Although 1-2-3 Release 3.x allows a maximum of 512 characters in a cell, only49 separate arguments can be used in the @MAX function and in other functionssuch as @SUM, @MIN, and @AVG.andP;  1-2-3 Release 2.x allows a maximum of 61arguments.andM;To get around this limitation, break the formula into more than one formula.andM;Enhance screen displayandM;with {INDICATE}andM;In 1-2-3 Releases 2.2 and 3.x, you can use the {INDICATE} command to displaya string of up to 240 characters in the mode indicator that appears in thetopright corner of the screen.andP;  Previous releases of 1-2-3 allowed a maximumof 5 characters as the string argument in the {INDICATE} command.andM;You can also use the {INDICATE} command to remove information that appears onthe top row of the control panel.andP;  Using this command with an argument of 80spaces (created by pressing the Spacebar 80 times) completely eliminates allinformation in the control panel--the current cell address, cell format,protection status, column width, and cell entry--and displays a highlightedbar across the top of the screen.andP;  Using the command with an argument of 79spaces eliminates all but the column letter.andM;The {INDICATE} command can also be used with any combination of characters todisplay customized information, such as application name, menu level, status,or any other useful information.andM;The command {INDICATE &quot;&quot;} clears the mode indicator.andP;  The command {INDICATE},without any argument, restores the mode indicator to READY.andM;Use the @REPEAT function as the string argument instead of manually enteringthe number of spaces.andP;  For example, the following macro command eliminatesall information from the control panel:andM;{INDICATE @REPEAT(&quot; &quot;,80)}andM;Negative sign ignoredandM;The @IF function in 1-2-3 Release 3.x will ignore a negative sign if it isthe first character in a string.andP;  For example, if cell A1 contains the label-test, the formula @IF(A1=&quot;-test&quot;,&quot;true&quot;,&quot;false&quot;) will yield the correctanswer of true.andP;  However, if A1 contains the label test, the formula willstill yield true, even though the correct answer is false.andP;  Earlier releasesof 1-2-3 evaluated the negative sign correctly.andM;One solution is to use the @EXACT function.andP;  The following formula results intrue only if A1 contains -test:andM;@IF(@EXACT(A1,&quot;-test&quot;), &quot;true&quot;,&quot;false&quot;)andM;Range Search basicsandM;The Range Search command in 1-2-3 Releases 2.2 and 3.x is very useful.andO;However, I sometimes call it search and destroy instead of search andreplace.andP;  Here are some tips for using Range Search:andM;1.andP;  An incorrect search and replace can destroy a file.andP;  Save your filebefore executing a search and replace.andM;2.andP;  The Range Search command will locate a number only if it is part of alabel or a formula.andP;  It will not find a number that is the result of aformula or function, nor will it locate numbers that aren't entered aslabels.andM;3.andP;  Be careful when using Replace to change formulas.andP;  For example, if yourworksheet contains the formula @ROUND(A3*B3,3) and you want to change therounding to two decimal places instead of three, enter, 3 for the searchstring and, 2 for the replacement string.andP;  If you simply replace 3 with 2,the cell addresses in the formula will also change, and the new version ofthe above formula will erroneously read:andM;@ROUND(A2*B2,2)andM;Remember that though the search string is not case-sensitive, the replacementstring is.andP;  If you search for the letter A, 1-2-3 will find both uppercase Aand lowercase a.andP;  However, if you want to replace quarter with Qtr, you mustenter an uppercase Q.andM;Default directoryandM;One of my coworkers who uses 1-2-3 Release 2.2 set his default directory toA.andP;  With a disk in drive A, he selected /Worksheet Global Default Directory,pressed the Escape key, entered a:, and then selected Update Quit.andP;  TheDefault Settings sheet indicated that the directory was A:\.andM;If there is a disk in drive A when he loads 1-2-3, all of the File commandsdefault to drive A.andP;  This is how the program should work.andP;  However, if heforgets to put a disk in drive A before he loads the program, all of the Filecommands default to the subdirectory in which the 1-2-3 program files arestored.andP;  If he selects /Worksheet Global Default Directory, the directory isstill A:\.andP;  The problem is that he must insert a disk in drive A, select/File Directory, and enter A: to get the File commands to look to drive A.andM;I don't know if this is a known problem with the software, but it caused us agreat deal of frustration.andM;You are describing a feature of 1-2-3 Release 2.2 that was included to easethe frustration users reported with Release 2.01.andP;  In 1-2-3 Release 2.01,when the default directory is set to A:\, you don't have to insert a disk indrive A before you load the program.andP;  As long as you insert a disk in drive Abefore you select any of the File commands, the program will look to the Adrive.andM;When you load 1-2-3 Release 3, you will get the error message Invalidconfiguration file if the default directory is A:\ and drive A is empty.andO;This means that the directory specified in the configuration file does notexist.andP;  If you press the Escape key, the error will be cleared, but thedefault directory will be changed to the directory in which your 1-2-3program files are stored.andM;In 1-2-3 Release 3.1, when the default directory is set to A:\ and drive A isempty, you'll get the error message Not ready error reading drive A AbortRetry Fail?andP;  If you insert a disk in drive A and press R (for Retry), 1-2-3will load and the default directory will be A:\.andM;Monitor &quot;burn-in&quot;andM;If an image has been displayed on your computer monitor for an extendedperiod, it may burn into the screen.andM;If you're using 1-2-3 Release 2.x and haven't created a graph in the currentfile, you can use the following technique to avoid &quot;burn-in&quot; of a spreadsheetimage on your screen.andM;When you need to leave you system and want to keep the current file active,save the file and press the GRAPH key.andP;  1-2-3 will beep and display a blankscreen.andP;  When you return, press any key to restore the screen.andM;If you are creating graphs in the current file, you can assign each graph aname, after all the settings have been specified, by selecting /Graph NameCreate.andP;  Select/Graph Reset Graph to reset all graph settings for thetechnique described above.andP;  Select /Graph Name Use to update or view thenamed graphs.andM;Shorter /XL and /XNandM;is betterandM;Many of my macros prompt the user to enter data.andP;  I have found it moreefficient to use the /XL or /XN commands instead of the {GETLABEL} or{GETNUMBER} commands when entering data into the current cell.andM;For example, the following macro command prompts the user to enter data intothe current cell:andM;/XNEnter your age ~~andM;To accomplish the same result with the {GETNUMBER} command would require muchlonger macro statement:andM;andplus;{GETNUMBER Enter your age,&quot; &quot;andamp;@CELLPOINTER(&quot;address&quot;)andamp;&quot;}~&quot;andM;Faster file linkingandM;I have a suggestion for Sullivan C. Richardson, who wrote in the OctoberLetters column (page 8) that file linking in 1-2-3 Release 3 is too slow.andP;  Iuse file linking in both Releases 2.2 and 3 and have found that Release 3 ismuch slower.andP;  I've discovered, however, that if I use the File Open commandto open all of the files that will be linked, the process is significantlyfaster.andM;The only limitation is that there must be enough RAM available.andP;  My files arerelatively small.andP;  This method is impractical if your files are large.andM;Erasing files onceandM;and for ALLandM;I use 1-2-3 Release 2.2 with Allways for its great printing effects.andP;  When Iam in 1-2-3 and save a worksheet using /File Save while Allways is enabled,it creates a file with the same file prefix as the WK1 file but affixes a.ALL extension.andP;  However, when I use /File Erase to erase a worksheet, theALL file is not erased.andP;  I am often left with ALL files for which there is noassociated WK1 file.andP;  The only way I have found to erase both files at onceis to use the DOS ERASE command.andP;  I use the asterisk (*) wildcard for thefile extension.andP;  For example, to erase files called TEST.WK1 and TEST.ALLlocated in the 123 22 subdirectory, use the following command:andM;ERASE C:\123[underscore]22\test.*andM;To make sure I don't have any outstanding &quot;orphaned&quot; ALL files, I print outan alphabetically sorted directory list using the following DOS DIR command:andM;dir sort prnandM;Formulas have rightsandM;tooandM;It's easy to right-align a label entered directly into a cell.andP;  Eitherprecede the label with a quotation mark (&quot;) label prefix or use the RangeLabel Right command.andP;  However, copying a right-aligned label or combining tworight-aligned labels in one cell is more difficult.andP;  For example, enter &quot;Johnin cell A2 and &quot;Smith in cell B2.andP;  To copy the label Smith to cell C2 andmaintain the right alignment, use the following formula:andM;@REPEAT(&quot; &quot;,@CELL(&quot;width&quot;,C1) -1-@LENGTH(B2))andamp;B2andM;To combine John with Smith in cell D2 and maintain the right alignment, usethe following formula:andM;@REPEAT(&quot; &quot;,@CELL(&quot;width&quot;,D1) -1-@LENGTH(A2andamp;&quot; &quot;B2)) andamp;A2andamp;&quot; &quot;andamp;B2andM;The formulas calculate the column width of the cell that contains theright-aligned label, A2 or B2, and puts the correct number of leading blankspaces in the cell that contains the concatenating formula to maintain theright alignment.andM;The formulas will result in ERR unless the column in which they're entered iswide enough to accommodate the resulting string.andP;  This technique works in1-2-3 Release 3.1 but not when WYSIWYG is attached.andP;  WYSIWYG has its owntext-justification technique.andM;Navigate cell contentsandM;If you have ever edited a long formula or label in a cell, you know that itcan be frustrating to use the RightArrow and LeftArrow keys to navigate thecell's contents.andP;  When you press EDIT, the cursor is located at the end ofthe cell entry, but you may need to edit something at the beginning of theentry.andM;You can shorten editing time by using the Home and End keys while in Editmode.andP;  Press the Home key to move the cursor to the beginning of the cellentry.andP;  Press the End key to move the cursor to the end of the cell entry.andM;In 1-2-3 press the Tab key while in Edit mode to move the cursor fivecharacters to the right.andP;  Hold down the Shift key and press Tab to move thecursor five characters to the left.andM;In Symphony hold down the Control key and press the RightArrow key to movethe cursor five characters to the right.andP;  Press Control-LeftArrow to move thecursor five characters to the left.andP;  This Control-key method also works in1-2-3.andM;Include dashed linesandM;in formula rangesandM;I frequently have to modify summary reports to reflect the changing number ofclients we serve.andP;  As shown in the figure below, I enter a dashed linebeneath the column headings and another dashed line above the row of totals.andO;If I include these cells in my formula ranges, I don't have to re-enter theTOTAL formulas when I add or delete rows within the summary area.andM;For example, the formula in cell B9 is @SUM(B2..B8).andP;  I can add or deleterows between rows 2 and 8 and the formula will adjust to include the addedrow's amount.andM;Sum positivesandM;and negativesandM;The December issue got me thinking of more-elegant and more-efficient ways tosolve other readers' problems.andP;  For example, in the following figure, what'sthe best way to separately sum the positive and negative values?andM;My first (and best) answer to this question was to use the @MAX and @MINfunctions.andP;  @MAX(list) returns the largest value in list, and @MIN(list)returns the smallest value in list.andP;  If a value is positive, @MAX(value,0)returns the value and @MIN(value,0) returns zero.andP;  If a value is negative,@MAX(value,0) returns 0 and @MIN(value,0) returns the value.andM;Enter the labels in row 1 and the values in range A2..A10 of the followingworksheet.andP;  To create the dashed line in row 11, enter \= in cell A11 andcopy that cell to range B11..C11.andP;  Enter the formula @MAX(A2,0) in cell B2and the formula @MIN(A2,0) in cell C2.andP;  Copy range B2..C2 to range B3..B10.andO;Column B contains the positive values from column A, and column C containsthe negative values.andP;  To sum the positive values and the negative values,enter the formula @SUM(B2..B10) in cell B12 and copy it to cell C12.andM;Autoexec NoandM;I'd like to clarify an idea submitted by E. Anthony Golda in the Decemberissue (page 86).andP;  When he creates a file that contains an autoexecutingmacro, he saves a copy of the file with Autoexec set to No.andP;  This settinglets you retrieve a file that contains an autoexecuting macro withoutautomatically executing the macro.andM;In 1-2-3 Releases 2.2, 3, and 3.1, no matter how the file is saved, the macrowill execute if Autoexec is set to Yes during the current work session.andP;  TheAutoexec setting is a Global setting and is not saved with the worksheet, soyou must make sure that Autoexec is set to No before you retrieve the file.andM;In 1-2-3 Releases 2.2, 3, and 3.1, select /Worksheet Global Default Status tocheck the Autoexec macros setting.andP;  To set the Autoexec default to No, select/Worksheet Global Default Autoexec No Update Quit.andP;  Select /Worksheet GlobalDefault Autoexec Yes Update Quit to set the default to Yes.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
