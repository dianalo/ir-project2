The volatility in the price of natural gas hascreated increased interest in finding alternative feedstocks for themanufacture of hydrogen. Thus, it is appropriate at this time to conductresearch which has the best opportunities for reducing H/sub 2/ productioncosts from coal gasification. Bartis and Marks (1984) have identifiedlow energy separation processes such as membranes as a key research opportunityin reducing capital and operating costs and hence the H/sub 2/ productioncosts. They state that technical improvements in gas separation couldlead to production cost reductions of 15 to 20 percent. Acid gases mustbe removed from the gas stream after gasification and prior to the shiftreaction. This separation step prevents sulfur poisoning of the shiftcatalysts and maximizes hydrogen production from the shift reaction.The second gas separation occurs after the shift reaction. CO/sub 2/must be removed from the product stream to produce high purity H/sub2/.</TEXT></DOC>
