A check of airlines indicates the demand for air travelhas jumped in the 11 days since President Bush declared anend to hostilities, with domestic traffic picking up fasterthan international traffic. Yet, it appears the economy isstill holding back many consumers.</LP><TEXT>   The travel business -- already hurt by the recession --was one of the industries hit hardest by the war, as concernsabout possible terrorism prompted many people to cancel ordelay vacations. Many corporations also significantlycurtailed foreign and domestic travel by employees.   But airline bookings now appear to be bouncing back almostas quickly as they dropped off when the U.S. began bombingIraqi forces. Some carriers, who also stand to benefit fromlower oil prices, have sought to stimulate demand evenfurther by offering cut-rate fares.   American Airlines, an AMR Corp. unit, said itstrans-Atlantic load factor, or the percentage of seatsfilled, is up 10 percentage points since the war ended. Itrefused to disclose to what level, although it acknowledgedthat international bookings are &quot;still soft.&quot;   An American spokeswoman said domestic bookings &quot;picked upmodestly&quot; since the war's end, and bookings for travel in May&quot;have improved significantly.&quot;   A spokeswoman at UAL Corp.'s United Airlines said bookings&quot;have been increasing every day since the war ceased.&quot; Sheadded, &quot;We view the increased call volumes as encouragingsigns that Americans are returning to their normaldiscretionary spending patterns.&quot;   Delta Air Lines said it has noticed an &quot;improving trend&quot;in bookings since the end of the war. A spokeswoman atChicago-based Midway Airlines, which slashed its fares lastWednesday in a one-week sale, said call volume at thecarrier's reservation lines was up 80% Friday from a weekearlier.   Executives at foreign carriers, too, are encouraged.&quot;There's been a huge surge in bookings in the last twoweeks,&quot; said Anthony Marks, executive vice president ofmarketing at Air New Zealand. &quot;Our advance bookings the firstweek the war ended shot up 20%, and it's kept going. Peopleheld off and held off in the hopes the war would be quick,and now they're rushing back.&quot;   &quot;Things have turned around quite considerably on allfronts,&quot; said Alastair Morrison, associate professor ofmarketing and tourism at Purdue University, who monitored thebusiness volumes at a number of travel agencies since thewar's end.   The improvements could represent a blip from pent-updemand during the war. Before the end of the war, traffic wasplummeting. Northwest's February passenger traffic fell 12.1%compared with a year earlier. Its load factor fell to 54.9%from 61.8%.   Despite the postwar jump, the recession is expected tokeep travel below last year's levels -- and that willcontinue to erode profits at airlines and other travelindustry businesses over the long haul.   &quot;Sure, business is picking up,&quot; said John Eichner,chairman of Simat, Helliesen andamp; Eichner, a New York-basedairline consulting group. &quot;But it's still disastrous. This isgoing to continue for about a year. It's a world-widephenomenon.&quot;   Jeannette Irby, owner of Treasure Island Travel inChicago, said that although business has &quot;picked up a littlebit,&quot; customers are still leery about buying an airlineticket. &quot;It's very, very slow,&quot; she said.   Wall Street analysts are just as glum. Some airline stocksare climbing on Wall Street, but that isn't because of highertraffic. Indeed, some analysts are cutting their earningsestimates. A few stocks are up because investors think theyare the likely survivors of this downturn.   Still, the travel industry is anxious to point out aturnaround. The Commerce Department trumpets that a record119,000 people attended the International Tourism Exchange, atrade show in Berlin that began around the time of the war'sceasefire. &quot;We're still in a period of recovery, but we'refast getting back to normal,&quot; said Linda Mysliwy, assistantsecretary for tourism marketing at the Commerce Department'sTravel and Tourism Administration. She predicts recovery &quot;aswe approach the spring.&quot;   The big hotel chain, Marriott Corp., commissioned a recentstudy by Wirthlin Group, a McLean, Va., research firm, that,not surprisingly, concluded Americans are traveling again.Marriott is part of a recently formed industry group that istrying to rally travelers. Last week, it coined itself: &quot;GoUSA] The Travel Coalition.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
