The St. Petersburg, Fla., firm has decisively outperformednine other major brokerage houses, most of them better known,in a study by this newspaper and Zacks Investment ResearchInc. of Chicago. The study estimates how investors would havedone if they had bought each stock highly recommended by aparticular firm.</LP><TEXT>   Raymond James won for the quarter, the year and the fiveyears ended June 30, 1991. It has strung together threered-hot quarters, in which its favorite stocks rose 22.1%,30.4% and 15.5%.   Previously, Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., a unit ofPrimerica Corp., and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. looked as if theywould be fixtures at the top of the long-term standings. ButSmith Barney is now second, and Goldman, which has stumbledin the past 12 months, hangs onto third place, a whiskerahead of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a unit of AmericanExpress Co.   &quot;We've found some powerful situations, and we've stuckwith them,&quot; says David Henwood, research director for RaymondJames. Many investors cash in their winners too soon, hesays. But when a company is exceeding expectations, it oftenpays to hang on.   That has certainly been the case with CascadeInternational Inc., which Raymond James rode to a 242% gainduring the year ended in June. Though the clothing andcosmetics retailer's stock has more than tripled, RaymondJames continues to recommend it. Mr. Henwood gives credit forpicking Cascade to Bert Boksen, the firm's chief investmentofficer and head of the special-situations research team.   Mr. Boksen says he first noticed Cascade simply as a nameon his computer screen. The Boca Raton, Fla., companyattracted his attention because it had high profitability, nodebt and a low price-earnings ratio, which is a company'sstock price divided by its per-share earnings.   &quot;I went to see them {in late 1989}, and they told a verybullish story,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I watched them for nine months,and visited them on three separate occasions. They did whatthey told me they were going to do.&quot; In August 1990, herecommended the stock.   Cascade's strategy, explains Mr. Boksen, is to acquirebankrupt clothing retailers, cut costs, nurse the stores backto profitability and install cosmetics counters in eachstore. Victor Incendy, Cascade's chief executive officer,used this tactic on Allison's Place and Diana's Shop.Recently, Cascade acquired most of Conston Corp., whichoperates stores catering to larger-sized women under the name16 Plus, soon to change to 14 Plus.   &quot;The beauty of acquiring a bankrupt property is you canrenegotiate the leases, in certain cases renegotiate the debtand close unprofitable locations,&quot; says Mr. Boksen. The charmof installing cosmetics counters is that the profit marginscan be high, &quot;particularly if you don't advertise.&quot; Cascadesells its own cosmetics brand, called Jean Cosmetics.   Cascade shares now fetch $11.50 apiece, but Mr. Boksenfigures they're not overpriced, since he expects earnings tohit 70 cents a share in the fiscal year that ends next June.&quot;It's still a debt-free company, with a {better than 25%}return on equity,&quot; he says.   Raymond James doesn't cover a lot of the stocks routinelycovered by big Wall Street houses, partly because itsresearch staff is smaller. It concentrates on certainindustries it thinks have growth potential. One isenvironmental protection, to which it devotes three analysts,and which has rewarded the firm with some big winners.   Clean Harbors, which specializes in the cleanup ofpolluted water, more than doubled during the recent 12months, and IMCO Recycling Inc., which recycles aluminumcans, rose 79.8%.   Smith Barney, with a five-year estimated gain of 101%,ranks second behind Raymond James's 134.3%. Alan Benasuli,director of research, says the firm currently likesfinancial, technology and energy stocks. It thinks banks,such as Norwest Corp. and Bankers Trust New York Corp., willbenefit from lower interest rates and industry consolidation.Its favorite technology stock is Intel Corp., which has astrong growth record but sells for less than 10 timesearnings. In energy, it likes Mobil Corp. and Texaco Inc.,partly for their substantial dividends.   Goldman hung on to third place, but its estimatedfive-year gain of 88.6% was only fractionally better thanShearson's 88.2%. And for the quarter and the 12 months endedin June, Goldman was last. Investors who followed itsstock-picking advice in the past year would have lost morethan 5% of their money, the Journal-Zacks study estimated.The firm wasn't hurt in the latest quarter by huge losers,though Biogen Inc. fell 24%, and USAir Group Inc. dropped23%, but rather by a striking absence of any big winners. Itstop June-quarter performer, Union Pacific Corp., was up 15%.   Goldman's research director, William Kealy, notes thatabout 20% of the firm's &quot;Focus List&quot; of recommended stockswere defensive oil and utility issues. &quot;It wasn't a time tobe defensive,&quot; he says. &quot;The rest of the world was playingoffense.&quot; Goldman was also lightly represented in cyclicalstocks, which have rebounded.   There was also a shakeup at the bottom of the standings.Prudential Securities Inc., a Prudential Insurance Co. ofAmerica unit that has long occupied the bottom rung of thelong-term ladder, had a good quarter, up 4.9%, and climbed toninth. Prudential scored nice gains in Georgia Pacific Corp.,up 24% during the quarter, United Telecommunications Inc., up17%, and Toys R Us Inc., up 14%. More important, it had nobig losses. Its worst pick, Gillette Co., was off only 9.4%.   Taking Prudential's place in the basement of the long-termrankings was Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., the largest U.S. brokeragehouse. Merrill's estimated five-year return was 53.3%, wellbelow the 75.5% on the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index.   Merrill had a bad second quarter, down 5.6%. Its losers inthe quarter included Intelligent Electronics Inc., down 42%,Compaq Computer Corp., down 39%, and American ManagementSystems, down 26%. Andrew Melnick, Merrill's director ofresearch, noted that the firm doesn't have a recommendedlist, as the other nine firms do, and is judged on itsindividual analysts' picks. He also commented, &quot;It was the PC{personal computer} area primarily&quot; that hurt Merrill'srecent returns. &quot;That area got hit badly in the quarter.&quot;   Price-earnings ratios for most of the firms' recommendedstocks ranged between 14 and 17, according to calculations byZacks. The highest median P-E ratios were at Sears, Roebuck andamp;Co.'s Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., 19.1, PaineWebber Inc.,18.3, and General Electric Co.'s Kidder Peabody andamp; Co., 17.5.The lowest median P-Es were at Smith Barney, 12.3.   The Zacks calculations also show that PaineWebber wasdrawn toward stocks of big companies, with a median marketvalue of close to $9 billion, as of June. Raymond Jamespicked by far the smallest companies, with median marketvalue of about $443 million. &quot;It has been our kind of market,no doubt about it,&quot; says Raymond James's Mr. Henwood. &quot;Mediumand smaller stocks have come back into investment favor.&quot;   Most of the houses are judged on an official recommendedlist. The longest list, with about 75 stocks, is fromShearson Lehman. The shortest lists, about 20 stocks apiece,are from Raymond James and Smith Barney.   ---       Comparing Brokerage Houses' Stock-Picking Prowess                                                                                                          Estimated performance of stocks recommended by major firmsin periods ended June 30, 1991, ranked by performance in themost recent 12 months                                                                                                        BROKERAGE HOUSE           Raymond James 3 MONTHS                  15.5% 1 YEAR                    32.2% 5 YEARS                   134.3% BIGGEST GAIN*             Cascade Intl.         +242% BIGGEST LOSS*             Electr.
