Market players have been interpreting almost everypronouncement, every troop movement and every rumor asbullish in recent weeks. While crude prices have soared,gasoline futures have risen even more, eclipsing a New YorkMercantile Exchange record.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;You can throw technicals out the window and fundamentalsout the window,&quot; said a trader at one large trading house.&quot;It's become standard procedure this month.&quot;   Gasoline for September delivery ended at $1.0126 a gallon,up 1.01 cents, on the New York Merc. While the gain was smallcompared with some recent days' trading, the session wasvolatile. The contract shot up around five cents at theopening to trade as high as $1.0650.   Gasoline's gains have exceeded crude's on the belief thatsupplies are tight and refining capacity in the U.S. islimited. &quot;U.S. refiners have `maxed out' on theirproduction,&quot; said one trader. &quot;They have no excess capacity,&quot;he said, although &quot;there is still crude around.&quot;   After trading finished in New York, the American PetroleumInstitute said U.S. refineries operated at 92.3% of capacityin the week ended Friday. That's down from the previous week,but any level above 90% is considered as maximum operations.   Around the middle of yesterday's session, marketparticipants were caught by surprise by a speech by SaddamHussein that they interpreted as milder in tone. &quot;They feltit was a softening in the rhetoric, and prices collapsed,&quot; ananalyst said. Many traders took advantage of the news to takeprofits. September gasoline traded as low as 95.5 cents agallon before recovering.   Crude oil contracts basically moved in tandem withgasoline, with most contracts ending with small increases. Itwas the last day of trading in September crude contracts,which ended at $28.41 a barrel, down 15 cents.   Traders were expecting a bullish inventory report from theAmerican Petroleum Institute yesterday afternoon and didn'tget one. But it's difficult in this kind of market to predicthow much of an effect the actual figures will have.   The API said crude oil stocks fell 271,000 barrels to375.7 million; analysts had expected a decline of more thanfour million barrels. Gasoline inventories actuallyincreased, by 1.5 million barrels to 214 million; analystshad expected them to drop by more than two million barrels.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Gold futures prices ended lower afterfluctuating in a $15-an-ounce range on Middle Easterndevelopments. Silver and platinum also declined. Decemberdelivery gold settled at $416 an ounce, down $2.80. It was ashigh as $425 in early trading and then plunged as low as $410after news services quoted the Iraqi foreign minister assaying Iraq was willing to talk with the U.S. and put theMideast situation before the United Nations. &quot;They may haveread more in the reports than actually was there,&quot; oneanalyst said. Later, prices partly rebounded when a U.S.spokesman reiterated the strong U.S. stand on freeing offoreign hostages held by Baghdad and an Iraqi withdrawal fromKuwait. Ken Gettinger, precious metals vice president for theNew York branch of the Union Bank of Switzerland, said thatfrom a technical viewpoint, gold should find support at $400an ounce and resistance at $425. Yesterday was the fourthtime that the December contract has touched or approached$425. It traded at $424.80 Aug. 13 and at $425 twice inMarch.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices dropped for the thirdconsecutive session. The September contract ended 1.95 centsa pound lower at $1.6675. That brought its total decline to14.2 cents since Thursday, just before Brazil announced areduction in export prices. Brazilian processors of frozenconcentrate are engaged in price-cutting competition, ananalyst said. But it isn't likely that Brazil will announcefurther significant price reductions, the analyst said,before the first estimate of the Florida orange crop, whichis expected in October. The crop is expected to show a slightimprovement from the frost-damaged 1989-90 harvest. ButBrazilian processors won't want to cut their prices muchfurther in case there is a drop in the Florida forecast, theanalyst said. Brazilian concentrate is about to beginarriving in the U.S., helping to ease concern about supplies,the analyst said.                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Traders said ADM Investor Services,the futures trading unit of grain-processing giantArcher-Daniels-Midland Co., sold 3,000 soybean oil futurescontracts, diminishing a position large enough to spawnrumors that ADM was trying to corner the soybean oil market.The firm was thought to hold more than half of all receiptsfor delivery of soybean oil based on July and August futurescontracts, which show ownership of the oil stored inwarehouses. But rumors that ADM may intend to corner themarket eased as analysts said the company may have built upits large position for legitimate business reasons. Amongthose reasons, they said, were expectations that fast-foodrestaurants will boost the demand for soybean oil byswitching for health reasons from lard to vegetable oils foruse in frying. In addition, the company may be banking onspeculation that the U.S. will have to offer more credit tothe Soviet Union for grain purchases because of widespreadfood shortages in that country.</TEXT></DOC>
