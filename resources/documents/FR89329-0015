Donald Youso, Office of EmployeeRelations, Bureau of Personnel, (202) 647-2781.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On November 29, 1988, the State Departmentpublished proposed regulations (53 FR 47970) on Victims of Terrorism Compensation.The comment period, which was 30 days from the date of publication, endedon December 28, 1988. Comments were received from two agencies and onefederal employee's union. Comments are summarized below, along with anychanges in, or clarification of, the proposed regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart A_General </ITAG>An agency suggested that the language exempting certain decisions fromjudicial review in section 192 was applicable only for determinations asto captive status and cash payments for captives. We agree that exemptionfrom judicial review is applicable only to these two determinations, andthe regulations are modified to reflect this fact. One commenter felt that the language in Section 192.1(a) could be readto require a determination of captive status for purposes of both sections5569 and 5570 of 5 U.S.C., and indicated that such determination is necessaryonly under the provisions of section 5569. We agree that a determinationof captive status is not required for purposes of section 5570, but believethat the language in andSection;192.1(a) is clear in making this distinction,and is not changed here. A question was raised on the propriety of the Secretary of the Departmentof Labor being part of the decision process for declarations of hostileaction in section 192. Such consultation is required by the Executive Orderwhich delegated responsibilities under the Act. Two commenters thought that the language in andSection;192.2 setting timelimits for filing applications was unclear. The language in the final regulationshas been changed to provide for a uniform filing period for declarationsof captive status and hostile action. Two commenters indicated that the definition of family member in andSection;192.3seemed to be inconsistent with the intent of the legislation. In the finalregulations we added language from the legislation to the definition offamily member that was contained in the proposed regulations. One commenter questioned the accuracy of the definition in andSection;192.3(g)pertaining to contract employees. This language elaborates on the definitioncontained in the legislation, as provided in the legislative history, andis not changed here. One Agency questioned if the intent of section 192.3(c) was to designatethe Secretary of State as the employer for contract employees or otherindividuals filling that description, for domestic as well as overseaslocations. Such was not the intent, and language is added specifying thatthe Secretary of State is responsible only for overseas situations. The employee union questioned the use of the word ``including'' in andSection;192.3(h),since the language in the definition is a quote from 5 U.S.C. We agreethe word ``including'' is redundant and it is deleted. An agency questioned the notification procedures in andSection;192.5(b),indicating that the responsibilities of agency heads and the State Departmentappear to be unclear. We agree that clarification is needed, and the regulationsare changed to indicate that the State Department has responsibility fornotification. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart B_Payment of Salary and Other Benefits for Captive Situations</ITAG>An agency questioned the use of the term ``family member of a Civil Serviceemployee'' as being inconsistent with the statute. We have modified thelanguage to ``family member of a principal'' to be consistent with thelanguage in the statute. One commenter questioned the language in andSection; 192.12 providing forthe establishment of an account to deposit the salary and benefits of captives,feeling that is contravened the language of the statute. Although the statuteindicates the Secretary of the Treasury will establish a savings accountfor a captive's pay and allowances, we have coordinated the writing ofthis section of the regulations with Department of the Treasury staff,and these regulations meet the requirements of the statute. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart D_Medical Benefits for Captive Situations </ITAG>A commenter stated that andSection; 192.31 places limitations on medicalcare not found in the statute. Furthermore, they described the proposedregulations as onerous. These regulations extend benefits to family membersand others who do not qualify for benefits under the Office of Workers'Compensation Programs (OWCP), and accordingly are modeled on the regulationsand procedures used by the OWCP to administer medical benefits under theFederal Employees Compensation Act. Therefore, we believe it is entirelyconsistent to utilize procedures adopted by OWCP to administer these benefits.We find that this section does not place limitations on benefits providedfor in the Act, nor are the regulations onerous. Rather, they are consistentwith the intent of the provisions of the Act. The same commenter voiced concern about provisions which call for the Departmentof State to decide the appropriateness of medical treatment, but also callsfor a private insurance carrier, if any, to be the primary source of reimbursement.The commenter felt that if a private insurance carrier authorized medicaltreatment, the Agency should not question such authorization. We agreethat this is the case, and there is nothing in the regulations that requiresAgency approval of medical treatment if approved by an individual's privatemedical insurance carrier. An agency suggested clarification of the language in andSection; 192.32(a)(1)which covers administration of medical benefits by the Department of Stateand Agency Heads. We have modified the last sentence of this section toclarify the procedures to be used by Agency Heads. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart E_Educational Benefits for Captive Situations </ITAG>One agency suggested clarification of andSection; 192.40(b) which extendsa benefit to a captive contingent upon the individual not being eligiblefor comparable benefits under Title 38 of the U.S.C. The final regulationshave been modified to add the suggested language. Section 192.44(b) hasbeen corrected to indicate that educational benefits for a dependent childterminate at age 21. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart F_Compensation for Disability or Death </ITAG>One agency suggested a need for clarification of the language of the thirdsentence of andSection; 192.50(a)(1), which defines eligibility for benefitsunder FECA. In the final regulations, we have included a reference to 5U.S.C. 8101(1) to clarify the language. A question was raised about the propriety of the language in andSection;192.51(a) which calls for payment of the death benefit to an individualwho dies as a result of injuries caused by hostile action or as the resultof captivity. In the final regulations, we have changed the language tostate that the death benefit is payable when the death was caused by hostileaction and was a result of the individual's relationship with the Government(although ordinarily death as the result of captivity will satisfy thesecriteria). <ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulations </ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>These rules will not have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities because they will affect only Federal employees and agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>These regulations do not require additional reporting under the criteriaof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.
