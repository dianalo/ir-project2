In 27 years thisblack impresario has had 22 hits. But only a few SouthAfrican whites have ever heard of him. His itinerant showsplay to packed community halls in the black townships acrossthe country. A typical Kente venue earlier this year was thedreary township of Tembisa. Thick coal dust hung in the air.The streets were dark, obscuring the rows of identical brickfour-room houses built in the mid-1950s. An armored car withwhite soldiers guarded the entrance to the township oppositea deserted fried-chicken joint.   Deep within the township, though, the community hall was buzzing with anticipation. The rowdiness contrasted sharply with the polite white theaters in Johannesburg, but when Mr. Kente's show began people watched in rapt attention and hissed for quiet.    Mr. Kente, age 55, lives in Soweto and is the son of a laborer. He started writing songs for choral groups and quartets when he was in high school, and later became a talent scout for a local record company. The first musical he saw was &quot;King Kong,&quot; a South African stage production about a local boxer. That play and others involving black actors were produced by a Johannesburg theater group supervised by whites. In 1960, Mr. Kente broke away and produced his first musical, &quot;Manana the Jazz Prophet,&quot; about a priest who felt that church services could be livened up with American gospel tunes instead of somber Anglican hymns.    He has been churning out shows ever since. Virtually every black actor and playwright has gotten his start with Mr. Kente. He writes the scripts and scores himself, and designs the mobile sets, which can be dismantled in five to seven minutes. The shows cost about $5,000 each to produce. On a good night, ticket receipts top $2,000. The best turnouts often come in small, remote townships where the arrival of a Kente show might be the biggest event, perhaps the only event, of the month.    Mr. Kente's 1974 musical &quot;How Long&quot; is the one best remembered by black South Africans. It conveyed an impatience for change that they shared, telling the story of a strict policeman enforcing the country's pass laws, which then restricted black residency in urban areas. Without the correct passes, blacks could be deported to impoverished rural &quot;homelands.&quot; Scenes depict the policeman as cruel or as a buffoon, but in the end he too is a victim. The policeman is forced to act against his own son, who has lost the birth certificate needed to prove his urban residency rights. Finally the policeman throws down his cap and jacket and sings the title song with the rest of the cast.    Many blacks felt that play and its sequel, &quot;Too Late,&quot; captured the anger of the mid-70s. So did the police. After riots broke out in Soweto on June 16, 1976, Mr. Kente was detained for five months.    Notwithstanding his stint in jail, Mr. Kente isn't popular among blacks for his political views, which are conservative. When white Prime Minister P.W. Botha's title was changed to state president, Mr. Kente sent him a note of congratulations. He says President Botha &quot;sometimes says beautiful things, but doesn't know how to say them.&quot; Mr. Kente also appears on state television, which is boycotted by most black artists and activists. In 1979, black activists ran Mr. Kente and his troupe out of the politically charged city of Port Elizabeth. Mr. Kente says he received threatening letters telling him not to return.    Since then, the conservative messages in Mr. Kente's plays have become more overt, even heavyhanded. His last two shows resemble something that might be written if the Reagan administration's assistant secretary of state, Chester Crocker, could carry a tune, do high-kicking migrant-worker dances, and speak a bit of Zulu and township jive.    In &quot;Bad Times,&quot; Mr. Kente questions the wisdom of sanctions, pokes fun at overbearing comrades and bemoans violence. In one skit, the popular African National Congress (ANC) is spoofed as the CNA, the name of a local magazine and stationery chain store. The plot is simple. A struggling theater troupe needs money to produce a play. Despite the admonitions of his wife, who wishes he would get a decent job, the troupe's manager turns to a Zulu money lender. But the play is cancelled when kill-joy comrades declare a &quot;Black Christmas&quot; and ban entertainment during the holiday season. Meanwhile, the economy deteriorates; the troupe manager's wife loses her job and a walk-on character sticks his head in a trash can and gnaws on some garbage.    &quot;It was a statement,&quot; Mr. Kente says. &quot;Political organizations are merely using people for their own ends. Necklaces, petrol bombs and school boycotts -- how do they benefit us?&quot;    Humorous portions of the show assuaged the sensibilities of some township residents, but not all of them. After the first act of a performance in Sebokeng township, five youths stopped the show. The young comrades objected to a scene that mocked Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu (dubbed Bishop Nobele) for his support of sanctions. Mr. Kente jumped onto the stage and urged them to judge the show after the entire performance. Swayed by his plea, the audience shouted down the youths. The show went on. &quot;To me that was a moment of glory,&quot; says Mr. Kente.    Mr. Kente's latest work, &quot;Sekunjalo,&quot; is even more controversial. It portrays a grim, post-revolutionary South Africa in which communist-party leaders dressed in red togas win the first elections and impose a one-party state. Blacks, unskilled after years of school boycotts, have trouble getting jobs and the police detain an opponent of the new regime in much the same way police detain people now.    Reaction to the play has been tepid. In his determination to send a warning about sanctions and the future, Mr. Kente neglected the formula that made him a success. And he deprived his audiences of the only things that enable blacks to endure times of oppression -- humor and hope.    ---   Mr. Mufson, formerly Johannesburg correspondent for the Journal, is working at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
