 Troubleis, there are nearly as many ways to generate and employ fonts on a PC asthere are letters in the alphabet.andP;  And despite WYSIWYG(what-you-see-is-what-you-get) claims from software developers, what you seeon the screen isn't exactly what you get on paper.andM;Apple Computer and Microsoft Corp. have agreed to try to forge a newstandard.andP;  In a rare merger of interests between the PC and Macintosh worlds,the two companies signed a cross-licensing agreement that could yield onestandard for displaying and printing fonts across both computingenvironments.andP;  The accord enables Microsoft to use Royal, code namd forApple's new technique for outline (or scalable) fonts in the OS/2Presentation Manager interface.andP;  For its part, Microsoft will license toApple its recently acquired PostScript-compatible printer software for use infuture versions of Apple's LaserWriter models.andP;  Currently, Apple is licensingPostScript from the developer, Adobe Systems, for its LaserWriter printers.andM;Apple is expected to deliver its new method for producing fonts in the nextrelease of its system software for the Mac, which is slated for the firsthalf of 1990.andP;  Microsoft has said only that it will include the fonttechnology in a &quot;future version&quot; of OS/2's Presentation Manager.andP;  Version 2.0of OS/2 is expected sometime in 1990, but at press time Microsoft hadn't saidwhether that version will include the Royal technology.andM;The Apple-Microsoft agreement promises to make using fonts far simpler andmore flexible than it is today.andP;  In place of a handful of typefaces at fixedsizes, users will be able to draw on a vast library of fonts and scale themto any size they need.andP;  The screen image of these fonts will match theirprinted form exactly, and exchanging typographically rich documents andsharing output devices among PC-compatible and Macintosh computers will beeasier.andP;  For users, it's these bottom-line benefits that make this agreementso significant.andM;&quot;This is not an esoteric issue,&quot; says Jonathan Seybold, president of SeyboldSeminars and publisher of the Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing.andP;  &quot;This isone of the fundamental building blocks for the next generation of computers.&quot;andM;Indeed, as graphical interfaces such as Presentation Manager and MicrosoftWindows become the norm in the coming years, Seybold believes the importanceand use of fonts will increase across the wide spectrum of PC applications.andO;&quot;That's true not just for desktop publishing or word processing, but also fordatabase and spreadsheet applications and everything else as well,&quot; he says.andM;A growing interest in fontsandM;Although it may be a year or more before users reap any reward from astandard font technology, many software publishers concur that a risinginterest in fonts and document appearance is inevitable.andP;  &quot;In the future,spreadsheet users will be much more concerned about fonts and appearance thanthey are today,&quot; predicts Marty Fahey, general manager for Lotus DevelopmentCorp.'s 1-2-3/G, the forthcoming graphical version of 1-2-3 for PresentationManager.andP;  &quot;Many of the things that people like in Allways [the 'spreadsheetpublisher' utility for 1-2-3 and Symphony] will be built right intoPresentation Manager products.&quot;andM;Because the font features won't appear until a later version of OS/2 andPresentation Manager, Fahey says the Apple-Microsoft agreement will notaffect the delivery or capabilities of the initial version of 1-2-3/G.andM;In the meantime, developers and users have other solutions to consider inmapping a fonts strategy.andP;  Hewlett-Packard, for one, is introducing ascalable-font technology, called Intellifont, into the PCL language thatdrives its LaserJet models.andP;  HP, which has so far sold more than 1.5 millionLaserJets, is the leader in laser printers.andP;  The company contends that thepopularity of the LaserJet line and the widespread software support it enjoyswill help make Intellifont a standard.andP;  (For a look at HP's new low-pricedlaser printer, see page 9.)andM;&quot;We're committed to Intellifont; it's ready to go,&quot; says Bill McGlynn,marketing manager for LaserJets at HP's Boise, Idaho, printer division.andO;&quot;It's very likely that we're going to have another million or so LaserJetssold with the Intellifont technology by the time the Royal technology ships.&quot;andM;Microsoft, in recognition of HP's market standing, announced it will workwith HP to develop a special Presentation Manager device driver for the newLaserJets with Intellifont capabilities.andP;  At the same time, however,Microsoft claims the Royal system is &quot;better technology&quot; for the long term.andO;&quot;Royal is the strategic direction for OS/2 and Presentation Manager,&quot; insistPeter Neupert, senior general manager for OS/2 at Microsoft.andP;  &quot;But,&quot; heconcedes, &quot;there are other technologies out there today that we also have toaccommodate somehow.&quot;andM;PostScript is another of those technologies.andP;  Adobe's PostScript, which firstbrought scalable type to desktop computers via Apple's LaserWriters and otherprinters, is still the predominant format in outline fonts.andP;  But Apple'ssplit with Adobe and its licensing of an &quot;enhanced&quot; PostScript-compatiblelanguage from Microsoft have cast a shadow over the future of Adobe'sPostScript.andP;  Soon after the Apple-Microsoft agreement, Adobe pledged toenhance PostScript and publish the secrets of its heretofore proprietary fontspecifications.andM;&quot;I think it's bad news for everyone .andP;  .  .  especially the customer,&quot; saysKevin Wandryk, typographic business manager at Adobe, of the multipleversions of PostScript.andM;Despite the confusion, Wandryk says he expects that Adobe's PostScript andits Adobe Type Manager technology for matching screen and printer fonts willbecome a standard in both the Mac and PC arenas and that Presentation Managerwill include a device driver for the Adobe products.andP;  He also anticipates amuch broader selection of PostScript fonts, now that PostScript'sspecifications have been made public.andM;Apple still supports PostScriptandM;Apple, meanwhile, has said that PostScript is still central to its printingplans and that it will continue to support existing PostScript devices.andP;  Howits Microsoft-licensed version of PostScript might differ from Adobe'sremains to be seen, but Apple says that should not keep anyone from choosinga font solution today.andP;  &quot;A lot of this doesn't make any difference in theshort term,&quot; explains Jim Gable, product manager for outline fonts at Apple.andO;&quot;What users currently have [fonts and printers] will still work.andP;  But [theagreement] enables us to create better, cheaper printers down the line.&quot;andM;The establishment of the Royal technology as the font standard may not be aforegone conclusion.andP;  Royal, however, has the backing of a number of key fontsuppliers, including Bitstream, Linotype, Letraset, and Agfa Compugraphic,some of whom pitched their own font technologies to Microsoft before it cameto terms with Apple.andP;  &quot;Sure, if they had chosen our technology, it would havegiven us an edge in the market,&quot; concedes Rob Friedman, president ofBitstream.andP;  &quot;But the Apple system is a rich environment.andP;  It will maketypography easier to use for the vast majority of computer users.&quot;andM;Standard-setter IBM has not publicly endorsed (as of this writing) the Royaltechnology.andP;  An IBM spokesperson says Royal will be among the font systems itsupports for OS/2--but it may not be the only one it wants to incorporate.andO;&quot;We do believe Royal is a sound font technology,&quot; says Tracy O'Neill, an IBMspokesperson, &quot;but we also need to protect and support the font investmentsthat our customers have already made.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
