Today manyof those same liberals are uniting to defeat a U.S.-Mexicofree-trade agreement because it might produce too muchprogress. The transformation of American &quot;progressives&quot; intoa force for reaction is an astonishing event.   This is especially troubling because these liberalactivists still form a large constituency in the DemocraticParty. As liberals have changed so have many Democrats,abandoning JFK's vision in favor of a protectionist agenda. Ageneration ago, most Democrats would have been natural alliesof Mexico's centrist President Salinas, who wants freer tradeas a way to modernize his country. Today Democrats andliberals stand allied with Mexico's far left, which candidlywants socialism.</LP><TEXT>   Consider Ralph Nader, &quot;America's leading consumeradvocate&quot; according to his lobbying group, Public Citizen.Mr. Nader says a trade pact will force the U.S. to abandonits &quot;laws on pesticide residues in food,&quot; &quot;contaminated food&quot;and &quot;disposal of hazardous waste.&quot;   Yet he must know that no importer can ignore U.S. laws. Hemust also know that higher-quality American products wouldonly improve consumer choice and health in Mexico. What couldbe better for consumers than lower prices for vegetables,clothes and other goods that could be made in Mexico andexported north? By opposing free trade, Mr. Nader has becomean advocate for less competition, higher prices andentrenched business interests.   Another &quot;progressive&quot; outfit, the Child Labor Coalition,opposes free trade because it might promote &quot;child laborexploitation.&quot; The group knows that Mexico bans work bychildren under age 14, and restricts it for those under 16,but says the laws are &quot;poorly enforced.&quot; That may be true,but economic growth spurred by free trade would make it lesslikely that children would be compelled to work. It's hard tosee how it helps children to keep their parents poor.   Then there's the Association of Farmworker OpportunityPrograms, which claims to protect the rights of farmlaborers. In Mexico, nothing has been worse for farm workersthan the feudal land-tenure system known as &quot;ejido.&quot; Freetrade in farm goods -- with its new investment andcompetition -- would help break the ejido. Creating more farmjobs in Mexico would also make it less likely that Mexicanswould travel to the U.S. as low-wage migrant workers.   The strangest free-trade opposition comes from American&quot;environmentalists&quot; -- such as Greenpeace and the NationalWildlife Federation. Michael McCloskey, chairman of theSierra Club, told the Senate last month that, &quot;areas beingrapidly industrialized as a result of freer trade agreementsare usually environmental disaster areas.&quot;   This defies all common sense. As recent months haverevealed, history's worst environmental disasters haveoccurred in the communist bloc, which pursued the autarkiceconomic policies Mr. McCloskey seems to be recommending forMexico. Free-trade Hong Kong has made progress against itspollution, while Beijing's command economy keeps fouling theair. Only prosperous nations have shown the democratic willto clean the air and water, while being able to afford suchelitist lobbies as the Sierra Club.   More predictable, but just as nonsensical, is oppositionto free trade by the AFL-CIO, the United Auto Workers andother unions. The AFL-CIO clearly doesn't care about Mexicanworkers, or it wouldn't mind if free trade helped raise theaverage Mexican wage from 1989's $2.32 an hour (one-sevenththe U.S. average). As for American workers, the AFL-CIO'sThomas Donahue claims that &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of workers&quot;have all seen their jobs exported to Mexico&quot; because ofexisting U.S. trade and investment. But those jobs were&quot;lost&quot; during a decade when some 18 million other new U.S.jobs were &quot;won.&quot;   Robert Zoellick, the State Department counselor, recentlytold the Senate that a free-trade pact will create from44,000 to 150,000 new American jobs -- surely a conservativeestimate. The average Mexican tariff on U.S. goods -- about10% -- is actually higher than the 3% to 4% average U.S.tariff on Mexican goods. So on the margin free trade willhelp American more than Mexican exporters.   What all these free-trade foes have in common is fear ofchange, of economic growth, of what liberals used to call&quot;progress.&quot; In the Soviet Union, truly liberal reformers havea name for these kind of people. They're called&quot;reactionaries.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
