The scandal is the most widespread ever in Japan, and the trialsare expected to delve deeply into issues involving the structure ofJapanese society.   Five separate trials are starting between today and Dec. 15 oncharges against two leading politicians, six bureaucrats and fourexecutives of the Recruit Co., an information services conglomerate.   The company is accused of trying to win favors and exertinfluence by showering huge donations and stock bargains on theelite of Japanese government and business.   At today's opening session, 59-year-old Takashi Kato, a formervice minister of labor, denied doing favors for Recruit in exchangefor shares in a subsidiary of the conglomerate. But he acknowledgednetting a $49,000 profit on shares bought cheaply from Recruit.   ``I have considerably damaged the credibility of the laboradministration and ... I deeply regret it,'' Kato said in TokyoDistrict Court, where Judge Taketaka Nakagawa presided at thetwo-hour, 20-minute session.   His co-defendant, 47-year-old Masao Tatsumi, a former Recruitexecutive, denied playing any role as an intermediary between Katoand Recruit's founder and former chairman, Hiromasa Ezoe.   Ezoe is to be tried starting Dec. 15 on seven counts of bribery.The scandal centers on Ezoe, an ambitious entrepreneur whobombarded senior politicians and bureaucrats with huge donationsand discounted shares in a Recruit subsidiary.   Neither of today's defendants lodged a formal plea, which is notthe procedure in Japanese courts.   The prosecution alleges that Kato influenced Labor Ministryregulations in a way that benefited Recruit's booming business ofpublishing employment magazines.   As the trials started, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu renewed hispledge of political reform.   ``This is an incident that should never be repeated,'' Kaifu wasquoting as saying by the Kyodo News Service and Japan BroadcastingCorp.   Kaifu said his governing Liberal Democratic Party is followingnew guidelines curbing political donations from corporations.   ``I think we have to work hard on political reform,'' he wasquoted as saying.   In August, Kaifu became the third prime minister in less than ayear after the scandal forced Noboru Takeshita to step down inJune. Takeshita's successor, Sousuke Uno, resigned after theLiberal Democrats suffered a crushing setback in July elections forthe upper house of Parliament.   Takeshita himself was found to have accepted $1.4 million inlegal donations.   Now, before elections for the more powerful lower house expectedearly next year, the new trials risk bringing out more damagingdisclosures.   In trying the defendants, prosecutors must show when a giftbecomes a bribe. The determination by the court could become asevere test of the close links between business and government inJapan.   The answers won't be known in full for years, given the slowpace of justice in Japan.   ``The Recruit case is not just another political corruptiontrial, but it is a challenge to the way Japan Inc. is set uptoday,'' said Hiroshi Itakura, professor of criminal law at NipponUniversity. Japan Inc. is a term that refers to the relationshipbetween government and business.   ``For those implicated in the case, it is almost as if they weredoing what everyone else was doing, and one day they woke up andfound themselves being criminal defendants in one of the largestbribery cases in history,'' he said.   Bribery carries a maximum five-year prison sentence.   Defendants whose trials start later include Takao Fujinami, aformer chief Cabinet secretary; and Hisashi Shinto, ex-chairman ofNippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Japan's largest company. Thescandals drove dozens of powerful men from their positions.</TEXT></DOC>
