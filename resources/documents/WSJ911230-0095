Although U.S. antitrust law covers anticompetitive actionsby foreign companies, a Reagan-era policy has preventedantitrust enforcers from going after foreign companies unlesstheir behavior harms U.S. consumers. Under the new policy,though, &quot;it would be enough to show harm to exporters&quot;regardless of whether consumers were harmed, said a senioradministration official. If prosecutors could prove illegalcollusion by foreign companies, they would sue U.S.subsidiaries of the firms in a U.S. court.                                                                                                          After a year of internal review, the department is tryingto sell the new, more aggressive antitrust policy to otherparts of the administration, including the CommerceDepartment. Justice Department officials may find a receptiveaudience at the White House; President Bush, who leaves todayon a trip to Asia, has been stressing the need to preserveU.S. jobs by lowering barriers to U.S. exports to countriessuch as Japan.   In his Christmas address, Mr. Bush said he would use the12-day Asia trip &quot;to fight for open markets and moreopportunities for American workers, because exports abroadmean more jobs right here at home.&quot;   The new policy, if adopted, could lead to litigationagainst such practices of foreign companies as agreementssaid to exist among Japanese conglomerates not to buyautomobile parts made by American firms.   The Reagan administration, as part of its broad campaignto curtail antitrust enforcement, set the policy of barringJustice Department litigation if there is no harm to U.S.consumers in 1984. Exporters in this country, as well as manyantitrust lawyers, have criticized the policy as beinginconsistent with the underlying law and detrimental to U.S.companies locked out by foreign buyer cartels.   James Rill, assistant attorney general for antitrustmatters, has backed the new policy for more than a year. Hehas recently gotten important support from the new attorneygeneral, William Barr.   Justice Department officials agreed that their push forextended antitrust jurisdiction comes at a politicallyconvenient time, when the White House is looking for ways todemonstrate concern about the weak economy. But thedepartment officials, who spoke on the condition ofanonymity, stressed that the new policy wasn't motivated bypolitics. Instead, the officials said, the new policyreflects the proper &quot;intent of the {antitrust} statute.&quot;   Separately, administration officials said the JusticeDepartment will fare relatively well in the president'sfiscal 1993 budget request, which will be submitted toCongress Feb. 4. The president is expected to ask Congress toappropriate more than $11 billion for the year, which beginsOct. 1, 1992. That amount would reflect at least an 8%increase over the $10.2 billion Congress appropriated for thecurrent fiscal year.   The Justice Department &quot;will do well relatively comparedto other agencies, and absolutely,&quot; said a senioradministration official. Some of the requested increase willgo for the federal government's continuing expansion ofprisons. Other areas expected to be prominent in thepresident's program will be:   -- White-collar crime in the insurance industry, whereprosecutors fear they see only &quot;the tip of the iceberg&quot; offraud that could be similar to what happened in thesavings-and-loan business.   -- Urban gangs, which have muscled in on traditionalorganized-crime groups in cities such as Los Angeles and NewYork.   -- Computer crime, including both high-tech vandalism by&quot;hackers&quot; who cripple government or private systems andactivities of thieves who are thought to be preying on banksand other businesses by manipulating computerizedtransactions. The Federal Bureau of Investigation isassembling a computer &quot;SWAT team&quot; that would lead majorinvestigations.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
