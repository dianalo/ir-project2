Only when a labor agreement is &quot;so far outside a widerange of reasonableness that it is wholly irrational orarbitrary,&quot; may a federal court consider a lawsuit bydisgruntled union members, the high court said in anunanimous decision written by Justice John Stevens.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Congress did not intend judicial review of a union'sperformance to permit the court to substitute its own view ofthe proper bargain for that reached by the union,&quot; JusticeStevens wrote.   The legal standard, which the high court clarifiedyesterday, gives unions wide breathing room to negotiatecontracts and settle strikes without being second-guessed byfederal judges for failing to fairly represent all unionmembers. The court said this standard applies even when it isobvious that the union &quot;made a bad settlement,&quot; one thatleaves some union members worse off than if the union hadended the strike unilaterally with no concessions from theemployer.   The decision was a victory for the Air Line PilotsAssociation, which was sued by some of its members who weredissatisfied with the 1985 settlement of a two-year-strikeagainst Continental Airlines. The disgruntled union workersargued that the settlement was unfair to some striking pilotswho faced obstacles returning to work or obtainingassignments on particular aircraft.   A federal district court in Houston dismissed the lawsuit,but a federal appeals court in New Orleans reinstated thecase and ordered it to trial. Yesterday, the Supreme Courtreversed the appeals court decision and threw out thechallenge to the strike settlement.

Thedecision, reversing the ruling of a federal appeals court inWashington, is a victory for railroads but a setback to railunions.   Federal law gives the ICC the authority to exempt mergingrailroads from federal antitrust laws and other laws. In anopinion written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the high courtsaid that &quot;other law&quot; includes labor law that requiresenforcement of valid labor agreements. Justices John Stevensand Thurgood Marshall dissented.   The case involved two mergers. One was between Norfolk andamp;Western Railway Co. and Southern Railway Co., now units ofNorfolk Southern Corp.; the other involved the Chessie Systemand Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, now part of CSX Corp.(Norfolk andamp; Western Railway Co. vs. American Train DispatchersAssociation)                                                                                                          Witness Fees                                                                                                          The justices ruled, 6-3, that the federal law that allowsthe winning party in a civil rights lawsuit to have hisattorney's fees paid by the loser doesn't apply to expertwitness fees. In an opinion written by Justice AntoninScalia, the court said each side must pay its own witnessfees. Justices Stevens, Marshall and Harry Blackmundissented.
