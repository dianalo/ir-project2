In communist North Korea, leader Kim Il Sung called forincreased economic and technological ties with capitalistcountries. He also said in a speech on the eve of North Korea's40th anniversary that he would welcome a delegation from archrivalSouth Korea to discuss reunification.   The demonstrations in Seoul and provincial cities attractedabout 3,500 students from a dozen colleges, the South Korean newsagency Yonhap said.   The most violent protests were reported in the southern city ofKwangju, where 600 students, throwing rocks and firebombs, foughtriot police after an anti-Olympic rally at Chonam University,Yonhap said.   Police fired tear gas as students tried to march off the schoolgrounds, Yonhap said. No arrests or injuries were reported.   The students in Kwangju accused the government of President RohTae-woo of trying to use the Olympic Games, to be held Sept.17-Oct. 2, to suppress democratic movements, campus sources said.   In Seoul, about 500 radical students and dissidents ralliedpeacefully at Korea University, urging the government to releaseall political prisoners before the Olympics.   Dissident leaders contended at the Seoul rally that the value ofthe Olympics would diminish if dissidents remained in prison.   The protesters, including about 50 people describing themselvesas ``elderly democrats,'' dispersed voluntarily after a briefsit-down in front of the school's main gate. Police stayed away anddid not intervene.   Radical students, a small but powerful minority on campuses,have demanded that the Olympics in Seoul be shared with North Koreato help reunite the divided Korean peninsula. They have littlepublic support.   In an interview Thursday, opposition leader Kim Young-sam saidthat he believed the Olympics would unite the South Korean people.   Kim said Koreans wanted the Olympics to be a major success andthat he was confident there would be no attempt to disrupt theGames.   North Korea has said it will stay away from the Seoul Olympics,because its demand to co-host the Games was not accepted. TheInternational Olympic Committee rejected the North's co-hostingdemand, saying the Olympics are awarded to a single city and cannotbe shared.   ``We deplore a half Olympics,'' Yonhap quoted protesters aschanting.   The students argued that the Olympics would only help perpetuatethe division of the peninsula, divided at the end of World War II,the agency said.   Yonhap said students also demanded the arrest of formerPresident Chun Doo-hwan for alleged involvement in corruption.   At Kyunghee University's Suwon campus in Suwon, 45 miles southof Seoul, 200 students burned an effigy of Chun and clashed withriot police, it said.   Police fired tear gas to stop the students from hurling rocksand firebombs, the agency said. No arrests or injuries werereported in the one-hour clash.   Chun, who stepped down at the end of his seven-year term inFebruary, has come under public fire for alleged involvement infinancial and other scandals.   Radical students and dissidents charge that the government isblocking legal proceedings to bring Chun to justice.   In his speech, broadcast by North Korea's state-run RadioPyongyang, Kim Il Sung said developing ties with friendlycapitalist countries is important in bringing his nation's economymore in line with those of advanced countries.   ``We should develop good neighborly and friendly relations withcapitalist countries which esteem our nation's right ofindependence,'' he said in the broadcast, monitored in Tokyo.   North Korea's sluggish economy is plagued with mismanagement,heavy international debt and an enormous portion of the country'sgross national product, some 20 percent, spent on the military.   The broadcast quoted Kim, 76, as saying during an 80-minutespeech at a rally that a North-South summit should discuss creationof a unified confederate government reuniting the peninsula, whichwas divided at the end of the three-year Korean War in 1953.   Reunification talks last month resulted in no agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
