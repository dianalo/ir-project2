Photoaffinity labeling studies have identifiedthe carrier proteins as two intrinsic membrane components (54 kDa and49 kDa) located on the sinusoidal surface domain. These proteins werealso labeled by DIDS which is a potent inhibitor of hepatocyte bile acidtransport. These two proteins have been significantly co-purified byaffinity chromatography and subsequently utilized as an immunogen forthe production of monoclonal antibodies. Spleen cells from immunizedSJL-J mice were fused with SP2/0 Ag 14 myeloma cells and the resultinghybridoma colonies screened by ELISA and immunoprecipitation assays.Colonies producing antibodies against these proteins were cloned andIgG mabs purified from ascites fluid on a protein A-Sepharose column.Several mabs were shown to bind to a 49 kDa protein on the surface ofintact hepatocytes, which was one of the proteins labeled by DIDS. Thebinding of one of these antibodies (25A3) to hepatocytes resulted ina substantial protection of the Na{sup +}-dependent bile acid transportsystem from inhibition by DIDS. Binding studies with {sup 125}I-25A3indicated that this bile acid carrier comprised approximately 1% of thetotal membrane protein. These results establish that a 49 kDa proteinin hepatocyte sinusoidal plasma membranes is a component of the sodium-dependentbile acid transport system.</TEXT></DOC>
