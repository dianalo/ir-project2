As hopes fade for a quick dollar recovery, European aerospace makers scramble for lasting ways to stem huge losses. They are moving more work to North America, squeezing domestic suppliers more and lobbying for more government support. The dollar pressure threatens to undermine Europe's progress in a critical high-technology field while aggravating an already tense point in U.S.-European trade frictions.    British Aerospace PLC, a partner in the Airbus Industrie international passenger-jet consortium, is the latest company to face up to a souring industry outlook. It may need more than the #450 million ($839.9 million) the British government promised last year to help Airbus launch two more models in the early 1990s, British Aerospace Chairman Roland Smith said in an interview with London's Financial Times that appeared yesterday. The problem: British Aerospace based its request on an exchange rate of $1.30 to the pound, in contrast to about $1.87 yesterday.    British Aerospace executives will meet United Kingdom government officials Monday to &quot;discuss the situation,&quot; a company spokesman said yesterday. He said the company is worried by the dollar's persistent weakness. &quot;It's a matter of being a bit more concerned than we were last year,&quot; the spokesman added.    The government will treat any British Aerospace request with extreme wariness, however. Airbus already has cost European taxpayers billions of dollars and says it lost $500 million last year. The consortium's owners, which include France's Aerospatiale S.A. and West Germany's Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H., concede it ought to improve its efficiency. As an alternative to costly development of future projects, Airbus is discussing collaboration with U.S.-based McDonnell Douglas Corp., Boeing Co.'s other major rival in the world passenger-jet market.    Airbus long has been a sore point in U.S.-Europe trade relations. U.S. officials argue that government subsidies allow Airbus to compete unfairly against private U.S. makers. Increased European aid to Airbus only would fuel U.S. displeasure.    Airbus is the most celebrated example of currency troubles plaguing European aerospace projects. The dollar is all-important to the industry, whose chief competition is in the U.S. European makers even price domestic civil aircraft in dollars.    The falling dollar hit large and small alike, quickly and sharply. Fokker Aircraft B.V., a small Netherlands-based maker, last month posted a 1987 loss of 107 million guilder ($17,8100) compared with a 19 million profit in 1986. State-owned Aerospatiale this month said 1987 profit fell 55% to 136 million French francs ($23.8 million).    A few months ago, U.K. industrialists discounted warnings of a prolonged dollar slump. With the dollar's slight strengthening early this year, &quot;industry took a much more relaxed view of what was going to happen,&quot; said John Lawson, a London-based analyst for Nomura Securities Co.    Reality set in as companies tallied 1987 losses and tried to gauge 1988 prospects. In March, British Aerospace reported 1987 losses on civil-aircraft sales of #86 million, compared with a #8 million loss in 1986. Then, in an unusual accounting measure, it declared a one-time charge against 1987 profits of #320 million to cover anticipated losses from future civil-aircraft sales. The provision, which covers work on current Airbuses and its own smaller planes, almost certainly will be consumed by 1992, when the first new Airbus model rolls off the line. British Aerospace won't get paid until Airbus sells the completed aircraft.    The provision lets British Aerospace partly mask the losses it faces this year and next. But analysts worry the company's exchange-rate projections still are too optimistic. &quot;(The charge) is frankly a little bit in the realm of creative accounting,&quot; said Keith Hodgkinson, a London-based securities analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.    Other British aerospace companies are coping with the pound's strength more conventionally, by hedging on foreign-exchange markets. But that only postpones the day of reckoning, assuming the dollar doesn't recover.    British Aerospace and other European aerospace companies also are trying to cut costs. Such efforts take time to pay off because aircraft take years to develop. The makers can fall back on more profitable military sales denominated in their home currencies, but European defense budgets are tight, lessening growth prospects.    To better protect against currency fluctuations, some European concerns are expanding U.S. production. Last week, British Aerospace said Textron Inc. would make parts of the wing for the next two Airbus models in Nashville, Tenn., moving $700 million of work out of Britain.    Smiths Industries PLC, a U.K. aircraft-equipment maker, last year bought the avionics operations of Lear Siegler Holdings Corp., a U.S. aerospace supplier. Now it can choose to make its cockpit instrument displays in Britain or the U.S. That might be good for America, but exporting the work &quot;is not a good thing for the U.K. industrial base,&quot; said Gerald Mortimer, associate director of the company. </TEXT></DOC>
