McBirney III, former owner of thedefunct Sunbelt Savings Association of Texas, was indicted bya federal grand jury here, the second major indictment in thepast month by the Justice Department in its investigationinto thrift fraud.   Mr. McBirney, whose life style and penchant for riskybusiness ventures earned him the nickname &quot;Fast Eddie,&quot; isone of a handful of former Texas thrift owners who have beentargets of the Justice Department's Dallas Bank Fraud TaskForce since the unit was formed three years ago. Theindictment came just four weeks after the indictment ofanother flashy former thrift owner, Don R. Dixon, who ownedVernon Savings andamp; Loan Association. Mr. Dixon has pleadedinnocent to the charges against him.</LP><TEXT>   Unlike the Dixon case, which was based on the alleged useof thrift funds to reimburse employees for political campaigncontributions and female escorts, the indictment against Mr.McBirney is based on actual loan transactions. Thosetransactions contributed about $160 million in losses toSunbelt's total losses of more than $2 billion, according tofederal thrift regulators.   The 17-count indictment relates to Sunbelt's attempt tofinance a unit's 1984 purchase of about $700 million of realestate in Southern California, including the Los AngelesAirport Hilton and Anaheim Hilton at Disneyland hotels.   &quot;The indictment is a typical case of government overkill,in which they have taken a single transaction that, beforeall the hysteria, would have been a two or three countindictment,&quot; said Mr. McBirney's defense lawyer, Paul Cogginsof Dallas. &quot;I don't see anything in the indictment that saysMr. McBirney personally profited or acted contrary to theinterests of Sunbelt.&quot;   The indictment specifically alleges that Mr. McBirneyconspired with a vice president of the now-defunct WesternSavings Association of Dallas for Western to provide about$30 million in financing for the California properties.   In exchange for the loan from Western, Mr. McBirney&quot;offered to give Western a $6 million profit on any piece ofproperty Western wanted to sell,&quot; the indictment says.   The property selected by Western was 708 acres on LakeLewisville, north of Dallas. Western lent a borrower $16.8million to acquire the land from a Western unit; Sunbelt, atthe behest of Mr. McBirney, then lent the borrower $22.6million to cover the principal of the Western loan, plusinterest, and a $6 million profit for Western, according tothe indictment.   The indictment accuses Mr. McBirney of misapplying Sunbeltfunds to keep the land loan current and of lying to Sunbeltofficers and Texas thrift officials about the status of theloan.   The indictment further charges Mr. McBirney with fraud inconnection with Sunbelt's financing of a subsequent, interimpurchase of the Lake Lewisville land by Kenneth Hood, aformer Western vice president. Mr. Hood is one of 10 peoplewho have pleaded guilty to criminal charges related toSunbelt transactions and are cooperating in the ongoing fraudinvestigation.   If convicted of all charges in the indictment, Mr.McBirney faces a maximum possible sentence of 85 years infederal prison and a $4.25 million fine. He is scheduled tosurrender to federal authorities today.   Mr. McBirney and five colleagues acquired Sunbelt Savingsin December 1982 and eventually merged it with four otherthrifts. During his ownership of Sunbelt, Mr. McBirney becameknown for the expensive parties he gave for employees atHalloween and Christmas.   Thrift regulators took control of Sunbelt in October 1986,but Mr. McBirney didn't resign from the thrift's board untilJune 1987. Less than a year later, Sunbelt, with $2.2 billionin assets, was merged with seven other thrifts to becomeSunbelt Savings FSB.   Mr. McBirney currently is chairman and chief executiveofficer of Dallas-based Oxidyne Group Inc., a troubledholding company with interests in real estate and solid-wastedisposal technology.</TEXT></DOC>
