L. 99-519. AHERA is the abbreviationcommonly used to refer to the statutory authority for EPA's rules affectingasbestos in schools and will be used in this notice. EPA issued a finalrule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of October 30, 1987 (52 FR 41846), the Asbestos-ContainingMaterials in Schools Rule (the Schools Rule, 40 CFR Part 763, Subpart E),which requires all Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) to identify asbestos-containingbuilding materials (ACBM) in their school buildings and to take appropriateactions to control the release of asbestos fibers.Under section 203 of AHERA, EPA may, upon request by a State Governor andafter notice and comment and opportunity for a public hearing in the State,waive in whole or in part the requirements of the Schools Rule, if theState has established and is implementing or intends to implement an ongoingprogram of asbestos inspection and management which is at least as stringentas the requirements of the rule. Section 763.98 (40 CFR 763.98) sets forththe procedures to implement this statutory provision. The School Rule requiresthat specific information be included in the waiver request submitted toEPA, establishes a process for reviewing waiver requests, and sets forthprocedures for oversight and recission of waivers granted to States. TheAgency encourages States to establish and manage their own school regulatoryprograms under the AHERA waiver provision.EPA issued a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of October 3, 1988 (53 FR 38838), which announcedthe receipt of waiver requests from the States of Connecticut, Rhode Island,Illinois, and New Jersey, and solicited comments from the public. The noticealso discussed the key program elements of each State program, listed differencesbetween each State program and the AHERA requirements, and provided EPA'spreliminary response to the four States on the differences identified.Four comments were received during the 60-day comment period. The Statesof Illinois and Rhode Island submitted comments on their respective waiverrequests by responding to the major differences discussed in the October3, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Two other comments addressed the New Jerseyprogram: One comment was supportive, and the other expressed concerns regardingthe program's stringency. No request for a public hearing was receivedon any of the four waiver requests. Consequently, no hearings were held.EPA is required to issue a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> announcing its decision to grant or deny a requestfor a waiver within 30 days after the close of the comment period. Thecomment period for this docket closed December 3, 1988. The 30-day reviewperiod may be extended if mutually agreed upon by EPA and the State. EPAwill not publish final decisions on the New Jersey and Illinois waiverrequests at this time. The State of New Jersey is in the process of completingits proposed asbestos regulations. EPA has agreed with the State to extendthe 30-day review of its application. At present, EPA and the State ofIllinois are continuing discussions on that State's waiver request. However,EPA and the State have agreed that the exclusion provisions of AHERA (40CFR 763.99) offer the appropriate relief for the approximately 1,300 previousinspections conducted by the State, if these inspections were conductedin a manner acceptable under AHERA. EPA will issue a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> giving its reasons for granting or denying eachState's application when a final decision is made. The remainder of thisnotice deals only with the waiver requests from Connecticut and Rhode Island.EPA, in letters dated December 16, 1988, agreed with both Connecticut andRhode Island to extend the 30-day review of their applications. This allowedthe States time to provide additional information requested by EPA to assurethat the States would incorporate certain AHERA requirements into theirasbestos inspection and management programs.During the 60-day comment period the State of Rhode Island submitted commentson its waiver request by responding to the major differences discussedin the October 3, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4>; the Rhode Island submission is discussed morefully in Unit II of this notice.The remainder of this notice is divided into three units. The first twounits discuss, respectively, the Connecticut and Rhode Island programsand set forth the reasons and rationale for EPA's decision on each State'swaiver request. Each of these units is further sub-divided into three sections.Section A discusses key elements of the State's program at the time thewaiver request was submitted. Section B enumerates the differences betweenthe State's program and the AHERA requirements as discussed in the October3, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice and the response to those differenceswhich EPA subsequently received from the State. Section C gives EPA's finalapproval of the waiver request based on the State's response. The thirdunit of this notice discusses statutory requirements of the Paperwork ReductionAct.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. The Connecticut Program</ITAG>A. Program ElementsIn June 1985, sections 10-292a and 10-292b of the Connecticut General Statutes,as amended by Public Act 86-65, became effective. The statute mandatedthat each public LEA in Connecticut inspect its school facilities for asbestos-containingmaterials (ACM) and develop asbestos management plans for each facility.LEAs responsible for Connecticut public schools constructed prior to January1, 1979, submitted Asbestos Management Plans to the State Department ofEducation (CTDOE) prior to January 1, 1987. The State Department of HealthServices (CTDHS) reviewed the plans and made recommendations regardingapproval to DOE. Forms provided by CTDOE were used for inspection reports.CTDHS developed a detailed asbestos decision protocol for the identificationand assessment of ACM, including recommended response actions, and an asbestosmanagement program and remediation options guidelines to be used by publicLEAs. Regulations promulgated pursuant to this statute require:1. Inspection of all public schools constructed prior to January 1, 1979,for the identification of friable and nonfriable ACM.2. Inspections to be conducted by a qualified inspector, defined as anindividual who has attended an EPA-sponsored program or its equivalentand has demonstrated to the Department of Health Services an ability tosample and identify ACM.3. An asbestos management plan to be developed and prepared by a qualifiedindividual when asbestos is identified. This individual must have attendedan EPA-sponsored course in asbestos management or its equivalent as determinedby CTDHS.4. The asbestos management plan addresses monitoring of ACM, educationof building staff, procedures to minimize asbestos fiber release, annualreviews, and a time schedule for implementing actions specified in theplan.5. Annual updates of the management plan.6. Periodic visual inspections every 2 months.7. Each LEA to have a designated person to oversee the LEA's asbestos program.8. Each school to keep a copy of the asbestos management plan in its administrativeoffice.B. Resolution of Differences Between State and AHERA<ITAG tagnum="81">Requirements</ITAG>In the October 3, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, EPA gave its preliminary response todifferences identified between Connecticut and AHERA requirements. EPA'sresponses were divided into two groups: those which need to be addressedby the State before May 9, 1989, and those which need to be addressed priorto the statutory date specific to the particular requirement. In a letterdated January 10, 1989, to Mr. John Coroso, Director, Division of Managementand Budget, Connecticut Department of Education, who was designated bythe Governor of Connecticut as the person with legal authority to carryout the requirements related to the waiver request, EPA indicated thoseitems from the October 3, 1988, notice requiring official assurance thatAHERA requirements will be incorporated into the State's asbestos inspectionand management program. The letter also listed those items for which satisfactoryassurances were already received in the State's original waiver requestsigned by the Governor. The remaining assurances were subsequently receivedin an official letter dated January 20, 1989, from Mr. Coroso to EPA. Thesefour assurances which follow were contained in the State's original waiverrequest:1. All public school buildings which are covered under the EPA rules butnot under the State regulations (i.e., schools constructed after January1, 1979) must be inspected and have management plans developed.CTDOE Response: In order to comply with this more stringent Federal requirement,CTDOE will require that these public school facilities be inspected forthe presence of asbestos according to established Connecticut regulations,decision protocols and remediation options. Asbestos management plans willbe submitted for these facilities.2. LEAs will provide yearly notification regarding asbestos activitiesto workers and building occupants or their legal guardians and that managementplans will be made available for public inspection.<T3>CTDOE Response:</T3> Section 763.84(c) of the AHERA regulations requiresthe LEA to ensure that workers, students, parents, teachers and other buildingoccupants are notified about the availability and locations of asbestosmanagement plans on an annual basis. To comply with this more stringentFederal requirement, CTDOE will require LEAs to annually inform workersand building occupants, or their legal guardians, about inspections, responseactions and post-response action activities, including periodic reinspectionand surveillance activities that are planned or in progress.3. All custodial and maintenance employees will be trained as requiredby EPA rules.<T3>CTDOE Response:</T3> Section 763.92 of the AHERA regulations requiresthe LEA to ensure that its maintenance and custodial staff who work ina building that contains ACM receive training of at least 2 hours. Thesection also requires the LEA to ensure that its maintenance and custodialstaff, who conduct any activities that result in the disturbance of ACM,receive an additional 14 hours of training. To comply with this more stringentFederal requirement, CTDOE will require LEAs to train their maintenanceand custodial staff in, at least, the following areas:(a) Information regarding asbestos and its various uses and forms.(b) Information on the health effects associated with asbestos exposure.(c) Locations of ACM identified throughout each school building in whichthey work.(d) Recognition of damage, deterioration and delamination of ACM.(e) Name and telephone number of the Asbestos Program Coordinator designatedto carry out general local education agency responsibilities and the availabilityand location of the management plan.The additional 14 hours of training for staff conducting activities whichmay result in the disturbance of ACM will include:(a) Descriptions of the proper methods of handling ACM.(b) Information on the use of respiratory protection as contained in theEPA/NIOSH Guide to Respiratory Protection for the Asbestos Abatement Industry,September 1987 (EPA 560/OPTS-86-001) and other personal protection measures.(c) The provisions of AHERA andSection;andSection; 763.91 and 763.92, AppendicesA, B, C, D, of Subpart E of Part 763, EPA regulations contained in 40 CFRPart 763, Subpart G, and in 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart M, and OSHA regulationscontained in 29 CFR 1926.58.(d) Hands-on training in the use of respiratory protection, other personalprotection measures, and good work practices.4. Warning labels will be posted in routine maintenance areas where ACBMis located.<T3>CTDOE Response:</T3> Section 763.95 of the AHERA regulations requiresthe LEA to attach a warning label immediately adjacent to any friable andnonfriable ACM and suspected materials assumed to be ACM located in routinemaintenances areas (such as boiler rooms) at each school building. Thiswarning label should read, in print which is readily visible because oflarge size or bright color, as follows: CAUTION: ASBESTOS, HAZARDOUS, DONOT DISTURB WITHOUT PROPER TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT.To comply with this more stringent Federal requirement, the CTDOE willrequire public LEAs to attach warning labels to:(a) Friable ACM that was responded to by a means other than removal.(b) ACM for which no response action was carried out.(c) All labels shall be prominently displayed in readily visible locationsand shall remain posted until the ACM that is labeled is removed.Remaining assurances were subsequently received in an official letter datedJanuary 20, 1989, from Mr. Coroso to EPA. Following is a list of thoseitems noted in EPA's January 10, 1989, letter; after each item or groupof items is a summary of the CTDOE response.For the first five items EPA required that the State incorporate requirementsinto its program for public schools by May 9, 1989:1. Until the Connecticut accreditation programs are approved by EPA, onlyproperly accredited asbestos professionals who have received accreditationfrom an EPA-approved program will be used by LEAs for inspections, managementplan development, abatement project design, and implementation.2. Management plans will be developed for schools found not to containasbestos and the plans will be submitted to the State.3. The recordkeeping requirements of the EPA rules will be implementedby LEAs.4. Provisions will be made for bringing schools, built after 1979 (whichwere not covered by State regulation), into the system of asbestos inspectionand management; buildings brought into the school system after the initialinspection will be subject to the AHERA requirements.5. The State will require, either administratively or through new regulations,that LEAs use the EPA criteria governing clearance sampling and use oftransmission electron microscopy to determine the adequacy and completenessof response actions.<T3>CTDOE Response:</T3> In its letter of January 20, 1989, the State assuredEPA that it would incorporate all five of these requirements into its programfor public schools by May 9, 1989.EPA required that in responding to Items 6 and 7 the State describe specificaction it proposes to take to ensure conformance with AHERA, and providea time schedule for incorporating each action into the State's program.6. Implement a plan which provides for reinspection of public schools atleast every 3 years.<T3>CTDOE Response:</T3> Public LEAs will be notified by February 15, 1989,of this requirement [letter is available in Docket]. The State will requireasbestos management plans to be submitted as a result of the reinspections.The plans will be scheduled for submission 3 years after the approval ofthe initial plans. The State provided for the docket a listing of publicschool districts, school facility addresses, date of asbestos managementplan approval, and reinspection due date.7. Upgrade the Connecticut enforcement program by implementing a routineinspection program to insure that LEAs are complying with the State's requirements.<T3>CTDOE Response:</T3> Beginning on January 1, 1990, at least 100 publicschool facilities will be inspected annually by CTDOE or CTDHS. These complianceinspections will include a review of the following:a. That an asbestos management plan is on file as required by andSection;763.94 of AHERA regulations.b. That warning labels are attached as required by andSection; 763.95 ofAHERA regulations.c. That an operations and maintenance program is implemented as describedin andSection; 763.91 of AHERA regulations.A report of all annual compliance reviews will be kept on file with CTDOE.Any public school district found not to be in compliance with the provisionsof Connecticut General Statute section 19a-3332d <T3>et seq.</T3> will be reported to the CTDHS, which may enforce compliancethrough Connecticut General Statute section 19a-332d and correspondingregulations. This section of the Connecticut statute allows for penaltiesof up to $5,000, or up to 1-year imprisonment or both, for violations relatedto standards for asbestos abatement.8. Bulk sampling schemes will be upgraded to AHERA standards for all futurereinspections.<T3>CTDOE Response:</T3> Bulk sampling schemes will be so upgraded.9. If the State identifies any deficiencies in the types of materials inspectedduring previous inspections, these deficiencies will be resolved duringthe next scheduled reinspection.<T3>CTDOE Response:</T3> Identified deficiencies will be so resolved.With one exception, the above assurances from Connecticut respond to allof the items contained in EPA's October 3, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. The exception regarded the need for adetermination by the State before May 9, 1989, whether or not past inspectionswere done in ``substantial compliance'' with current EPA regulations. Upon further review, the Agency has decided that determination of substantialcompliance with respect to past inspections under 40 CFR 763.99 (Exclusions)is not a condition for a waiver under 40 CFR 763.98. Under 40 CFR 763.99(a)(4),the substantial compliance decision is included in the management plan.Whether a State lead agency has properly made this ``substantial compliance''decision arises during enforcement of the regulations against a schoolwhich claims it does not have to conduct an AHERA inspection. It is, therefore,an issue to be decided among those State offices with responsibility fordeciding and advising on enforcement matters. In addition, during any oversightof State programs under 40 CFR 763.98(h), EPA may examine State compliancewith 40 CFR 763.99(a)(4) in making these substantial compliance decisions.As noted in item 9 above, however, deficiencies other than those affectingthe substantial compliance decision may be resolved during the next scheduledreinspection. C. EPA'S Decision on Connecticut's Request for Waiver EPA has received formal assurances from the Governor and from the leadagency (CTDOE) having the legal authority to carry out the requirementsrelating to the waiver request that Connecticut will incorporate into itsasbestos inspection and management program by the statutory dates all ofthe applicable requirements contained in EPA's October 3, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Accordingly, EPA grants the State ofConnecticut request for waiver from the requirements of 40 CFR Part 763,Subpart E. This waiver is applicable to public schools only. EPA retainsAHERA jurisdiction for private schools in Connecticut. This waiver is subjectto rescission under 40 CFR 763.98(j) based on periodic EPA oversight evaluationand conference with the State in accordance with 40 CFR 763.98(h) and 763.98(i),effective May 9, 1989. Federal jurisdiction shall be in effect in the periodbetween the date of publication of this notice and May 9. This will assurethat the State has sufficient time to prepare to assume its new responsibilities.It will also assure the public that no gap in authority occurs, and givesthe public sufficient notice of the transfer of duties from EPA to theState of Connecticut. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Rhode Island Program </ITAG>A. Program Elements In July 1985, Chapter 23-24.5 of the General Laws of Rhode Island becameeffective. The statute required that the Rhode Island Department of Health(RIDOH) undertake inspections of high priority group buildings, which includedpublic and private school buildings. All Rhode Island public and privateschools were inspected by RIDOH personnel by September 1987. RIDOH useda numerical algorithm to rate the hazard posed by a particular type ofACM in a given area. The ratings assigned to each area were intended tobe used as a basis for allocating State abatement funds. RIDOH did notestablish recommended or required abatement actions based on the numericalratings. Pursuant to the statutory authority, RIDOH promulgated regulations(January 1986 and August 1986) which require: 1. The submission of an asbestos abatement plan by the building owner ifthe RIDOH inspection identifies material containing equal to or greaterthan 1 percent asbestos. Upon RIDOH notice, the building owner has 120days to submit the asbestos abatement plan. 2. The asbestos abatement plan includes: bulk and air sampling information;blueprints or floor plans; an operations and maintenance program whichaddresses the monitoring of ACM; the education of maintenance staff; actionsto minimize fiber release and the potential of human exposure to asbestos;and a description of abatement actions. B. Resolution of Differences Between State and AHERA <ITAG tagnum="81">Requirements </ITAG>In the October 3, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, EPA gave its preliminary response todifferences identified between Rhode Island and AHERA requirements. EPA'sresponses were divided into two groups: those which need to be addressedby the State before May 9, 1989, and those which need to be addressed priorto the statutory date specific to the particular requirement. In a letterdated January 17, 1989, to Mr. James E. Hickey, CIH, Chief, Division ofOccupational and Radiological Health, Rhode Island Department of Health,who was designated by the Governor of Rhode Island as the person with legalauthority to carry out the requirements related to the waiver request,EPA indicated those items from the October 3, 1988, notice requiring officialassurance that AHERA requirements will be incorporated into the State'sasbestos inspection and management program. The required assurances weresubsequently received in an official letter dated January 25, 1987, fromMr. Hickey to EPA. Following is a list of those items noted in EPA's January17, 1989 letter. Following each item is a summary of the RIDOH response.1. Until Rhode Island accreditation programs are approved by EPA, onlyproperly accredited asbestos professionals who have received accreditationfrom an EPA-approved program will be used by LEAs for inspections, managementplan development, abatement project design, and implementation. <T3>RIDOH Response: </T3>EPA has previously (May 27, 1988) approved RhodeIsland's Asbestos Contractor, Site Supervisor and Worker accreditationprograms under the EPA Model Contractor Accreditation Plan (52 FR 15875).The State's current regulations for consultant certification are identicalto those contained in the EPA Model Plan. In addition, the State resubmitteda request for EPA approval of this accreditation program for inspectors,management planners, and abatement project designers on November 25, 1988,and is awaiting action on this request. Under current State regulations,RIDOH cannot certify a consultant who has not received training from aprogram approved under the EPA Model Plan and will only accept LEA management/abatementplans from State-certified consultants. 2. In addition to the current yearly notifications LEAs already provideregarding asbestos activities to workers and building occupants, the Stateof Rhode Island will require that LEAs also provide notice to parents orlegal guardians. <T3>RIDOH Response: </T3>LEAs will be notified by letter that the notificationrequirements of State regulations also include appropriate annual notificationsto parents or legal guardians.   3. LEAs will make management plans available for public inspection.<T3>RIDOH Response: </T3>Access to abatement/management plans is guaranteedby section 23-24.5-11(a) of the General Laws (asbestos program enablinglegislation). However, RIDOH will request that LEAs include a notice ofavailability in the annual notifications referenced in Item 2 above.4. Recordkeeping requirements of the EPA rules will be implemented by LEAs.<T3>RIDOH Response: </T3>LEAs will be informed in writing of the requirementsof maintaining all AHERA-mandated records. AHERA recordkeeping requirementsare addressed, at least in part, by current RIDOH regulations. RIDOH willreview the remaining requirements with State legal counsel to determineif this administrative notification to LEAs must also be supplemented byadditional amendments to State regulations.5. Schools which have no ACM will submit management plans and follow notificationrequirements.<T3>RIDOH Response: </T3>RIDOH will advise LEAs with schools previouslyidentified as ``containing no asbestos'' that they are subject to the requirementsof the initial AHERA inspection and plan submittal process outlined in40 CFR 763.93. These LEAs will also be advised of the annual notificationrequirements referenced in items 1 and 2 above.6. All LEA custodial and maintenance employees will be trained as requiredby EPA rules, including a 2-hour awareness training.<T3>RIDOH Response: </T3>The 14-hour training for maintenance and custodialemployees mandated by 40 CFR 763.92(a)(2) has been addressed by modifyingthe Competent Person training requirements in the State's regulations.LEAs will be advised in writing that the training for maintenance and custodialemployees mandated by the State's regulations must include at least the2 hours mandated by 40 CFR 763.92(a)(1).7. LEAs will meet the requirement to have a designated person in chargeof the LEA asbestos program.<T3>RIDOH Response: </T3>This is an essential element of all AHERA managementplans and RIDOH will also remind each LEA in writing of this requirement.For the following Items 8, 9, and 10, EPA required that the State providespecific actions it proposes to take to ensure conformance with AHERA;and provide a time schedule for incorporating each action into the State'sprogram.8. Asbestos abatement clearance air sampling will be done in accordancewith EPA requirements.<T3>RIDOH Response: </T3>Rhode Island will propose appropriate amendmentsto its regulations for all buildings subject to the AHERA rules. The timeframefor regulation amendments can vary from 1 to 6 months. Rhode Island's AdministrativeProcedures Act provides for both ``emergency'' and routine promulgationof regulations. RIDOH will review these items with State legal counselto determine the appropriate rulemaking option. In any case, RIDOH doesnot foresee any complications which would put the implementation date ofthese amendments later than July 1989. The school districts will be informedof the applicability of the regulations, and RIDOH assures that these regulationswill be in force by the effective date of the waiver.9. Provisions for phasing in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) requirementsfor asbestos abatement clearance sampling will be done in accordance withEPA requirements.RIDOH <T3>Response: </T3>RIDOH's response is identical to that contained in Item8 above.10. Past management plans will be updated to conform with the provisionsfor assessing ACM.<T3>RIDOH Response: </T3>All of the reports of inspections previously conductedby RIDOH have already been sent to each LEA. These reports should haveprovided enough information for the LEA to perform an assessment of eacharea in accordance with 40 CFR 763.88. However, some of this informationis several years old and the physical condition of the ACM may have changedto the point that an assessment based solely on this information couldbe totally inaccurate. Consequently, RIDOH will advise the LEAs that theseareas should be formally assessed only after additional review by LEA personnelwith AHERA training and/or AHERA-certified consultants hired by the LEA.The majority of the LEAs in Rhode Island have filed deferral requests inaccordance with TSCA section 205. Consequently, it is RIDOH's understandingthat these assessments must be completed and appropriate management planssubmitted to RIDOH on or before May 9, 1989. Unless contrary informationis received from EPA, RIDOH will so advise the LEAs.For Items 11 and 12, EPA required that the stated AHERA requirements bein place on or before the date required by law.11. If Rhode Island identifies deficiencies in the types of materials inspectedduring previous inspections, these deficiencies will be resolved duringthe next scheduled reinspection.<T3>RIDOH Response: </T3>The majority of Rhode Island's initial inspectionswere done between January 1986 and July 1987, with essentially all inspectionsof buildings subject to AHERA completed by December 1987. As noted in item10 above, the results of these inspections will be reviewed by the LEAsprior to submittal of their management plans. All of the buildings previouslyinspected by RIDOH will be subject to the 3-year reinspection requirementbetween January 1989 and December 1990. Consequently, all deficienciesshould also be resolved by the end of this reinspection period.12. All LEAs which have buildings with ACM must be required to implementa program of periodic surveillance every 6 months or the State must providesufficient justification to show that its current program is ``as stringent''as AHERA.<T3>RIDOH Response: </T3>State regulations require that management/abatementplans include a schedule for periodic monitoring and documentation of theresults of surveillance. Management plan reviewers evaluate proposed surveillanceintervals to determine if they are appropriate under the circumstances.Items which are considered include the type, condition, accessibility andpotential for significant damage of the ACM, traffic and/or activity levels,as well as present and proposed use(s) of the area. RIDOH review criteriarecognize that some areas (e.g., main corridors, gymasiums, veritcal risers,and stairwells) will usually require surveillance at intervals more frequentthan every 6 months. Conversely, RIDOH does not believe that low-activityareas which are otherwise secured and/or unused (e.g., crawl spaces) needto be entered every 6 months solely for the purpose of such surveillance,particularly when the management plan also includes procedures which limitaccess to these areas to individuals with proper training and equipment.RIDOH requires that this surveillance be performed by an individual certifiedas a ``competent person.'' The above criteria have been in place sinceRIDOH promulgated detailed abatement/management plan submittal requirementsin January 1986.With one exception, the above assurances from Rhode Island respond to allof the items contained in EPA's October 3, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. The exception regarded the need for adetermination by the State before May 9, 1989, whether or not past inspectionswere done in ``substantial compliance'' with current EPA regulations.Upon further review, the Agency has decided that determination of substantialcompliance with respect to past inspections under 40 CFR 763.99 (Exclusions)is not a condition for a waiver under 40 CFR 763.98. Under 40 CFR 763.99(a)(4),the substantial compliance decision is included in the management plan.Whether a State lead agency has properly made this ``substantial compliance''decision arises during enforcement of the regulations against a schoolwhich claims it does not have to conduct an AHERA inspection. It is, therefore,an issue to be decided among those State offices with responsibility fordeciding and advising on enforcement matters. In addition, during any oversightof State programs under 40 CFR 763.98(h), EPA may examine State compliancewith 40 CFR 763.99(a)(4) in making these substantial compliance decisions.As noted in item 11 above, however, deficiencies other than those affectingthe substantial compliance decision may be resolved during the next scheduledreinspection. C. EPA's Decision of Rhode Island's Request for Waiver EPA has received formal assurances from the lead Rhode Island agency (RIDOH)having the legal authority to carry out the requirements relating to thewaiver request that Rhode Island will incorporate into its asbestos inspectionand management program, by the statutory dates, all of the applicable requirementscontained in EPA's October 3, 1988, <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Accordingly, EPA grants the State ofRhode Island a waiver from the requirements of 40 CFR Part 763, SubpartE, effective May 9, 1989. Federal jurisdiction shall be in effect in theperiod between the date of publication of this notice and that date. Thiswill assure that the State has sufficient time to prepare to assume itsnew responsibilities. It will also assure the public that no gap in authorityoccurs, and gives the public sufficient notice of the transfer of dutiesfrom EPA to the State of Rhode Island.
