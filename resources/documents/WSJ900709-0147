The subsidiary, Sogexport, has been charged by Frenchauthorities on two separate occasions in recent years withillegally trying to export high-technology equipment to theSoviet Union. In both cases, the equipment in question couldhave been used to manufacture advanced semiconductors, whichin turn could be used in missiles and military jets.</LP><TEXT>   The two cases still are pending or under appeal. SocieteGenerale, which has insisted that its subsidiary didn't doanything wrong, said the company sale wasn't linked to thecontroversy.   &quot;Those exports represent only a tiny part of Sogexport'sbusinesses,&quot; a Societe Generale official said. &quot;We simplydecided that banking and international trade were verydifferent busineses. Other banks have reached the sameconclusion and withdrawn from the trading business.&quot;   Sogexport's buyers are Societe Auxiliare d'Entreprises, aconstruction group, and Finexport, an investment group. OneSociete Generale official said that, because the constructionbusiness is increasingly international, it might make moresense for SAE and a group of investors to own Sogexport.   Societe Generale didn't disclose the price. But thecomplexity of East-West trade together with East Europe'sfinancial troubles have taken their toll on the SocieteGenerale subsidiary. After showing a profit of two millionfrancs ($361,020) in 1987, Sogexport posted losses of 10million francs in 1988 and 27 million francs in 1989.   Societe Generale created Sogexport in 1977 and held 91% ofits shares. Under a special agreement, Societe Generaleagreed to continue its involvement in Sogexport'smining-equipment export business, notably including along-term coal-mining project in northern China.</TEXT></DOC>
