Sales should hit the $240 billion mark by year-end, said Peter F. McCloskey, president of the trade group, in a report prepared for delivery at a conference here today.    The fastest-growing sector in U.S. electronics was parts, whose nine-month sales surged 19.4% to $32.9 billion.    Computers and industrial electronics, the largest sector, saw sales rise 10.9% to $64.5 billion through the end of September.    Communications-equipment sales grew 5.5% to $45.8 billion from the year-earlier period, while consumer electronics edged up only 1.2% to $3.7 billion.    Other electronics products and services -- a category comprising automotive, aerospace and integrated-software products -- jointly grew 9% to $36.1 billion in the nine months.    Mr. McCloskey said, &quot;We are extremely pleased at the overall performance of our industry,&quot; in particular the indications for another full-year record in 1988.    Association officials couldn't be reached for elaboration on the report. </TEXT></DOC>
