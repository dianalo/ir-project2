The suit alleged that the automated teller network, set up by five New England banks, assessed fees in such a way as to discourage its smaller member banks from participating in other networks.    In return for BayBank's withdrawal of the lawsuit, New England Network agreed to eliminate a portion of fees charged its Yankee 24 ATM members involving transactions processed by other networks.    The automated-teller network was established by Bank of Boston, Bank of New England, Shawmut Bank, State Street Bank andamp; Trust Co. and Fleet National Bank, a unit of Fleet Financial Group. </TEXT></DOC>
