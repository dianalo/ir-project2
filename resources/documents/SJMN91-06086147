Officer Tom Gunther said theroadway was cleared about 10:30 p.m., and the highway was reopened in bothdirections.;    Caltrans crews had worked with bulldozers and trucks to clearthe debris from the two southbound lanes.;    Most debris gone;  By 6 p.m.Monday, most of the debris was gone, but a slippery sleet storm furtherhampered the rush-hour drive over the mountains.;    CHP officials said theywere amazed no one was injured in the mudslide, which occurred Sunday about10:30 a.m.;    &quot;Because there were heavy rains, traffic was slow, so nobodywas hurt,&quot; said CHP spokesman Jeff Pingree. &quot;But someone could have reallybeen hurt if the slide happened in peak commute hours.&quot;;    The slide dumpedenough debris on the road to fill more than 50 trucks -- which made it a longand tedious process for Caltrans crews.;    &quot;We are just trying to clear thisout as soon as we can, so that we can get traffic routed through here as soonas possible,&quot; said Jim Walters, Caltrans area superintendent out of SantaCruz.;    As the sun peeked through the clouds Monday afternoon, Waltersexplained that there was no way to tell where -- if at all -- a mudslide wouldoccur along the highway.;    'Geologically unsafe';  &quot;If you look at all thesteepest places along this highway, all along here it's geologically unsafe inheavy rains,&quot; Walters said.;    After the Loma Prieta earthquake shook looseslides in 1989, Caltrans surveyed the area closely and shored up areas alongHighway 17 where the earth had tumbled. Those areas -- many of the steepestcuts over the summit -- were cleared of all debris, covered with a mesh thatis supposed to act as erosion control and planted with seed.;    But becausethe hillside that gave way Sunday didn't slide in the quake, crews didn'tsecure it with wire mesh. Only hillsides with no vegetation left were secured,Costa said.;    None of the secured hillsides -- near Laurel Road, Glenwoodand south of the summit -- has slid during recent rains.;    &quot;We don't just gothrough and clear everything until there's been a slide of some sort,&quot; Walterssaid. &quot;The way this area is structured . . . well, gravity is just trying topull everything to the bottom.&quot;;    And the bottom is the four lanes ofHighway 17.;    Motorists aren't the only ones vulnerable to mountain slides.;   But mountain residents in one community considered vulnerable to slides,the Villa Del Monte area, appeared less nervous about their homes thangeologists are.;    Instead, one resident used the latest rains as evidencethat the area, which was hit hard by the earthquake, is not as vulnerable asgeologists make it out to be.;    &quot;The geologists . . . have been telling us-- it's going to move in a heavy rain, and now, we've had the rain andnothing's moved,&quot; said one resident who asked not to be identified. &quot;I'manxious to see what the geologists are going to say now.&quot;;    Fear of futureslides;  Santa Cruz Vice Mayor Don Lane was concerned about the risks offuture slides burying sections of Highway 17.;    After the earthquake, hesaid, road crews had no reason to doubt that the concrete barriers would dothe job, he said.;    &quot;Maybe we didn't deal with it as well as we shouldhave,&quot; said Lane, who also serves on Santa Cruz County's RegionalTransportation Commission. &quot;But that was all we knew to do at the time.&quot;;   Now, he questioned whether Caltrans engineers should return to Highway 17 toreinspect other hillsides that might have the potential to slide in heavyrains.;    &quot;Now that we have more time,&quot; he said, &quot;we should go back and takea more careful look.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MICHELLE GUIDO AND PAUL ROGERS, Mercury News Staff Writers  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910326  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO; MAP  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  855  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday March 26, 199100086147,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
