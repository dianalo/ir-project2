She watches a computer screen that shows the number of telephone calls coming in, the number being handled, and the average time a caller spends on hold. If a lot of order-takers are drumming their fingers, the hostess can step up her spiel or drop the price. If a product triggers a flood of calls, she can soften her presentation or spread it out a few more minutes.    &quot;We've even had situations where we've told the audience, 'Don't call now because the lines will be busy for a while,' &quot; says Jerry Troupe, executive assistant to Home Shopping Network Inc.'s chairman, Roy Speer.    The system relies on MCI Communications Corp.'s new 800 service. MCI completed its part of the new system last fall, in an effort that was unusual both for the speed with which the system was installed and the cooperation between the top levels of the two corporations. Around that time, St. Petersburg, Fla.-based Home Shopping sued GTE Corp. in a Florida state court for $1.5 billion, claiming it lost millions of customers because of foul-ups with phone equipment provided by GTE's Florida unit. GTE maintains that Home Shopping's allegations have no merit and has asked the court to dismiss the suit.    &quot;If our phone lines don't work, the door to our business is locked,&quot; says Mr. Troupe. With its previous system, a computerized switch &quot;either wouldn't show calls that were there or would show calls that weren't there,&quot; he says. As a result, he says, show hosts and hostesses unnecessarily cut prices of some popular products and stretched out pitches for unpopular ones. Home Shopping profit was off more than 50% in the six months ended Feb. 29, but it has predicted improvements as it recovers from its telephone troubles.    MCI President Bert C. Roberts Jr. says the suit made everyone aware how critical telecommunications is to Home Shopping. MCI's work began last summer after Mr. Speer made a one-day trip to MCI's Washington headquarters, demanding personal commitments from top executives. Mr. Roberts recalls how Mr. Speer looked him straight in the eye, poked a finger in his chest and growled, &quot;I'll be holding you accountable.&quot;    For MCI, it was a chance to sign up the biggest customer yet for its 800 service.    To link MCI's system with Home Shopping's facility, MCI installed 39 miles of fiber-optics cable in about two months, Mr. Troupe says. The communications company also built a small call-switching room in Home Shopping's building and beefed up parts of its own network to handle the additional traffic. From MCI's lines, traffic is switched to a Rockwell International Corp. automatic call distributor; the system also uses Unisys Corp. ordering equipment.    Mr. Roberts recalls the network's first test. Without warning MCI, Home Shopping told its viewers to call within the next five minutes and get a free product. &quot;Everyone called and our network came to a halt,&quot; Mr. Roberts says. &quot;We had blockages and HSN had problems of its own.&quot;    But the experience showed there was a much bigger viewing audience -- and market -- than Home Shopping had realized. Both MCI and Home Shopping quickly added capacity. Before the deluge, 200,000 calls was considered a heavy day. Now, as many as 1.5 million calls are handled a day, Mr. Troupe says.    About 70% of all callers place orders, while the rest seek information or want to provide a testimonial. Part of the growth is attributed to Home Shopping's expansion; it has added cable and UHF outlets, and in some markets supplanted the black-and-white westerns and environmental flicks that run in the wee hours.    Each week, MCI furnishes computer tape with billing and traffic information. &quot;The next step,&quot; says Mr. Roberts, &quot;is to do this electronically. If they get the information quicker, they can pay the bill quicker and can be more responsive to customers.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
