Subsequent articles will examine how the Moslem countries are reacting to the spread of Islamic fundamentalism, often seen as threatening, in their societies.    In Mecca, more than 400 Moslems die in clashes between Shiite fundamentalists and Saudi riot police.    In the Persian Gulf, Iran's Revolutionary Guards train suicide squads to attack U.S. warships.    In Tunisia, Islamic radicals set fire to three tourist hotels.    Thus go the week's headlines from the Moslem world. To most Americans this world is alien and alarming. Again and again -- in the rubble of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut a few years back and now in the waters of the Persian Gulf -- America finds itself confronting the consequences of a global Islamic revival. And Iran, for all its menace, is only one of many faces of the movement.    Eight years after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini established a theocracy in Iran and thrust Islam into the American consciousness, the forces of frustration, alienation and economic deprivation that sparked the resurgence of Islam are, if anything, stronger than ever. That the ayatollah so far hasn't managed to replicate his revolution, except in a slice of lawless Lebanon, is little comfort to the rulers of the Moslem world -- or to American policy makers.    It is clear that religious ferment, often labeled Islamic fundamentalism, is welling up across the Moslem world, from Morocco to Indonesia and far south into black Africa. There are in all more than a billion followers of Islam (the word means &quot;submission&quot;), a religion whose most basic tenet is chanted by believers five times a day: &quot;There is no God but Allah, and Mohammed is his messenger.&quot;    The fervor touches every Islamic nation, from the radical regimes of Syria and Algeria to the conservative monarchies of Morocco and Saudi Arabia. It stirs even in Soviet Central Asia, whose 50 million believers form the fifth-largest concentration of Moslems, after those of Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India.    As a result, leaders of every Islamic country but Iran, and especially those in the Middle East and North Africa, are more vulnerable today than ever before. Topping that list is Egypt, the largest Arab nation and a key American ally, followed by sundry Persian Gulf sheikdoms that account for 60% of the world's proven oil reserves. Given America's commitment to a number of Mideast regimes, growing instability in the region carries not only economic but also military risks.    At a time when Marxism is so debilitated it is being shored up by capitalism, when Christianity lacks much of the missionary fire that once drove it, when Maoism is all but entombed with its founder and when democracy sounds only a muted appeal to much of the world, Islamic fundamentalism stands out as the movement on the march.    The reasons vary somewhat from nation to nation. In some measure, the zeal reflects a lack of other tolerated forms of protest. But the Islamic resurgence seems primarily a grass-roots phenomenon sparked by disillusionment with Western values and a Westernized way of life. It manifests itself in many ways in many places. It is not a monolithic movement orchestrated and controlled by Ayatollah Khomeini or anyone else.    In some places, such as Tunisia and Morocco, it remains a largely moderate force seeking simply the imposition of traditional Islamic law (Sharia) and values. In other places, most notably Iran, fundamentalism is expansionist, virulent and violent. And in still other countries, such as Egypt, radical and more moderate Islamic movements compete for public support.    Beyond that, there is a tug of war between what Islamic scholar James Bill calls &quot;populist Islam&quot; and &quot;establishment Islam.&quot; The second term refers to the topdown religion as used by, for example, the Saudi royal family, Morocco's King Hassan or Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq to preserve power and maintain the status quo.    Islamic fundamentalism can be worn as either a hair shirt or a regal robe. Sheik Kishk, a prayer leader whose taped anti-government sermons are hawked on Cairo street corners, claims to be a fundamentalist leader; so does the fabulously wealthy King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, who at last year's Islamic summit announced that he should no longer be addressed as &quot;your majesty&quot; but as &quot;protector of the holy places.&quot; Almost every Islamic leader these days is proclaiming himself as the true fundamentalist and his opponents as impostors. Thus, all leaders are threatened.    Nowhere is the Islamic resurgence mainly a movement of the downtrodden masses. The very poor in Moslem countries, as in others, are more concerned with daily survival. Fundamentalism is more a phenomenon of middle-class Moslems, many of them initially attracted to modern manners and Western ways but frustrated by their inability to find material success or spiritual fulfillment. It is in many ways a movement of alienated youths who have found that university degrees don't win them jobs and modern weapons don't win victories over Israel or America. In the Arab world in particular, it is a movement of people who have failed to find either personal or national self-esteem.    &quot;The motive force behind the spread of fundamentalism is the hopeless situation of the middle classes in the Moslem world,&quot; says Johannes Jansen, a prominent scholar of Islam and author of &quot;The Neglected Duty,&quot; an analysis of the movement in Egypt.    Islamic fundamentalists have thus turned against the ideologies and systems of both East and West, but most of all against America. To Iran the U.S. is the great Satan, but even the more moderate fundamentalists are fundamentally anti-American. Radical or moderate, they blame imitation of the West for their countries' failings. They tend to see their secular rulers as autocratic, corrupt and cowardly instruments of America. And they differ only on how to remove them -- peacefully or violently.    To many outsiders the radical/moderate division is defined in terms of Shiites and Sunnis, the two major branches of Islam. Shiism, dominant in Iran but the minority sect in most other places, is indeed more hospitable to radicalism. It was conceived in opposition to the political heirs of the Prophet Mohammed, the Shiites believing his immediate successor should have been his son-in-law, Ali, not an unrelated associate. Shiites recognize a hierarchy of mullahs and ayatollahs as their leaders and reject any secular authority. Sunnis, who make up 90% of the world's Moslems, are more ready to accept systems in which religion and politics can coexist, for they have no structure of earthly religious leaders.    Yet analyzing fundamentalism only along Shia-Sunni lines is simplistic. Not all Shiites are radicals or revolutionaries, and some Sunnis, like the assassins of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, are as ready to use violence as Khomeini's cadres.    Neither Shiites nor Sunnis draw the kind of distinction between politics and religion that Christian cultures do. The biblical dictate to &quot;render under Caesar the things which are Ceasar's and unto God the things that are God's&quot; is foreign to Moslems. It is this mixing of politics and religion that makes Islam so confusing and often so threatening to non-Moslems.    The melding of the religious and the temporal goes back to Mohammed, the Arabian trader who founded Islam in the seventh century. He spread its tenets not simply by preaching the word but also by conquering and converting with the sword. Moses never reached his Promised Land and Jesus's kingdom was not of this world, but Mohammed went on to rule with armies and taxes and Islamic laws.    Some modern countries populated by Moslems, most notably Indonesia, have managed to enforce a division between politics and religion, to function as secular states. At the other end of the spectrum is Iran, the ultimate theocracy. In between are many Islamic countries groping for an accommodation between traditional religion and modern politics. Most permit little popular political involvement. Thus, part of Islam's appeal today is that it is an acceptable form of political expression.    If a Moroccan, a Pakistani, a Tunisian, or a Saudi wants to criticize his political leader, the safe way to do so is to attack him as un-Islamic. &quot;The only way people express independence from the state is through fundamentalism,&quot; says Fouad Ajami, an Islamic scholar at Johns Hopkins University.    Political struggle in the Moslem world thus is a volatile mix of religious purists crusading against political systems that offend their sensibilities and of political activists who are using Islam to justify their political agendas.    No one in the Islamic world can feel entirely secure these days. And no outside powers -- neither the U.S. nor the Soviet Union -- seem to know how to deal with spreading fundamentalism.    Among Moslem rulers, the trend is to try to co-opt it. In the tiny Persian Gulf state of Bahrain, the ruling sheik, a conservative Sunni who survived an Iranian-inspired coup attempt, manages to contain the fervor of his largely Shiite citizenry by building mosques, personally paying homage on Shia religious occasions and assiduously avoiding confrontation. King Hassan of Morocco plays up his lineage as a descendant of the Prophet and also seeks to skirt confrontation. There is no evidence, however, that co-opting or kow-towing provides security in the long term.    Certainly, no one has yet had any success at confronting the movement head-on. A few who have tried, like the shah of Iran or President Sadat, have paid a heavy price. For radical Islamic fundamentalists, confrontation offers its own reward: Martyrdom is an immediate passport to paradise.    ---                     The Peoples of Islam                               POPULATION                          --------------------                          TOTAL         MOSLEM     PERCENT COUNTRY                 (000s)         (000s)      MOSLEM Indonesia              165,000        140,250         85% Pakistan                95,000         92,150         97 Bangladsh              101,500         90,335         89 India                  750,000         90,000         12 Soviet Union           277,000         49,860         18 Egypt                   48,000         43,680         91 Iran                    43,000         42,140         98 Nigeria                 89,000         40,050         45 Morocco                 23,000         22,770         99 Algeria                 22,000         21,798         99 Sudan                   21,700         15,624         72 Afghanistan             15,500         15,345         99 China                1,042,000         15,000          1.4 Iraq                    15,000         14,250         95 Ethiopia                36,000         12,600         35 Syria                   10,200          8,976         88 Saudi Arabia             9,000          8,910         99 Malaysia                15,700          7,693         49 Tunisia                  7,100          7,029         99   Source: American Institute for Islamic Affairs</TEXT></DOC>
