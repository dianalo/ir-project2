(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Government regulators around theworld require too many long and costly tests to determine whethernew synthetic chemicals are cancer hazards, two experts said Monday.   A few relatively quick tests can identify the class of chemicalsthat form the greatest hazard, and new tests may have to be devisedfor the rest, they said at a science writers seminar sponsored bythe American Cancer Society.   ``Nobody knows how to register a chemical that's safe around theworld'' because so many tests are required, including those that donot really tell how hazardous a chemical would be for humans, saidJohn Ashby of the Central Toxicology Laboratory of ICI Ltd., achemical company in Chesire, England.   A limited number of short-term tests will correctly identifychemicals that can cause genetic mutations, which have the highestchance of causing cancer in humans, he said.   One major test, called the Ames test, looks for genetic changesin bacteria called salmonella. Another compares the molecularstructure of a new chemical to those that have provencancer-causing in the past, he said.   Such tests will overlook chemicals that cause cancer withoutdamaging genes, and which apparently affect the natural mutationrate of genes, he said. New tests in animals will probably beneeded to find those, he said.   Currently, some regulators require high-dose tests in mice andrats that run two or three years, and chemicals are labeledcancer-causing even if they cause only specific tumors inparticular sexes of rodents, he said.   No chemical with such limited effects has been shown to causecancer in people, he said. Such chemicals are far less likely tocause cancer in humans exposed to low dose levels than one shown todamage genes and cause cancer in a range of tissues in severalrodent species, he said.   Saccharin is one example of a chemical with only limited effectin animals that should not be considered a carcinogen for people,he said.   Vincent DeVita, head of the National Cancer Institute, said hethought the labeling of saccharin as a carcinogen was``overblown,'' making for confusing comparisons with such cancerdangers as cigarette smoke.   The theme of excessive testing was echoed by the second experton chemicals, Michael Shelby of the National Institute ofEnvironmental Health Sciences.   He said that of 23 chemicals or chemical combinations on astandard list of cancer hazards, 20 score positive on the Ames testor another short-term test that checks for genetic damage in bonemarrow of rodents.   Another would probably score positive, he said. The remainingtwo are asbestos fibers and a form of estrogen. So when newsubstances that resemble either of those come up for testing, theyshould get special consideration, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
