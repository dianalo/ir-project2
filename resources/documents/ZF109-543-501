These are concepts thatinherently have dimensionality and can easily be expressed visually.andP;  Theprecise actions taken and the objects they act on, however, are generallybest represented symbolically: they are groups of things or variables, andprocedures.1 By and large it's not graphical curlicues and icons that matterin visualization of structure, but the relationships between items, whichcould just as well be labels in plain boxes  - whether part-of or kind-ofrelationships for data, or follow-from, choose-among, lead-to, etc.andP;  foractions, or input and output boxes as with VPL's Flex (page 8).andM;Programmers have been using such tools for some time, generating flow chartsand data diagrams and state-transition diagrams, but end-users have mostlybeen baby-fed menus and programming-by-example tools: Draw your data in thewindows, show what you'd like to see, and we'll write the code for you.andP;  Orthey write low-level step-by-step macros: Move 3 steps right, select item,display.andP;  Or, open file &quot;c:todo.lis&quot;  - and let the user take it from there.andM;For noncoders, visual representations are a wonderful medium ofcommunication:  No, that's not what I mean.andP;  This should go here,&quot; is a moreuseful response than, &quot;I guess it looks okay; I can't understand all thiscomputer code.andP;  We'll try it out and let you know.&quot; Kinks in a system getdiscovered early.andP;  Visual representations are sort of a simulation, with timetransformed into a physical dimension on the screen (or printout).andM;The two new products described below make the transformation betweenvisualized structure and words/code elegantly and simply, each in its ownway.andP;  Calypso is a programming tool for workflows that lets you code andvisualize or visualize and code as you prefer; AllClear is a thinking toolthat helps both programmers and non-programmers to think clearly byautomatically generating a flow chart or diagram of any set of procedures ordecision steps from a clearly written description of a sequence of events andconditions.andM;CALYPSO: TASK BY TASK, PERSON BY PERSONandM;Groupware is an ideal application for visual programming.andP;  It's intuitive(far more than rows and columns) to represent workflows as arrows andbranches between boxes representing people or departments or decision points.andM;High-end workflow groupware, like mainframe software (and the financialplanning systems of old) implies central control, but there's also room forsimple processes that could be modeled and &quot;programmed&quot; by end-users.andP;  Whilerepresenting the flows is easy, it's tougher to build a rigorous system thatandM;1 &quot;Procedures&quot; can be refined into sequences of smaller procedures which canalso be represented graphically.andP;  The trick is to have a hierarchical systemthat allows you to look at the desired level of detail, generally by Itzooming&quot; in and out.andP;  But you can zoom with a labeled box as easily as with acute icon.andP;  can convert those flows into code, so that the representationbecomes an executable expression rather than just a pretty drawing to guide aprogrammer in his coding.andP;  This capability, we believe, will drive thespreadsheet of groupware: a tool to enable workers and managers to mock upsimple procedures as easily as analysts do simple forecasts.andM;For example: Juan gets the phone call and types the customer's name andaddress into a form for entry into the database.andP;  Then he sends it to Alice,who does the actual work  - usually sending out a letter or a free sample and records that action in the database.andP;  In some cases, she needs to tellFred, who sends out a bill (and records the payable in the database).andP;  Afterthis process takes place a few times, Juan might decide held like to automatethe workflow, and construct a little program to do so.andP;  Call it &quot;instructing&quot;the system if you want to be extremely user-friendly.andP;  (You might wonder ifJuan couldn't do Fred's job too by interacting with the database, but that'sanother story, and a longer-term implication of the trend to automation ofroutine procedures that groupware implies.)andM;The success of groupware &quot;spreadsheets&quot; depends not just on visualization andease of use, but also on the creation of appropriate sales channels and oncontrol issues.andP;  Just as MIS wants control of data, so does it also wantcontrol of applications.andP;  &quot;I start with end-users and network managers,&quot; saysTony Kobine, &quot;but invariably it goes to the MIS people.&quot;andM;In the beginningandM;One of the first such attempts was Staffware, developed by Tony Kobine at aUK company called FCMC five years ago (see Release 1.0, 86-2).andP;  But theproduct lacked a visual component and it used its own proprietary database.andO;Based on UNIX, it took over the user's system entirely and didn't effectivelyintegrate with the user's own tools.andM;FCMC is now benefiting from a new version of Staffware and greaterpenetration of UNIX in office environments.andP;  It is most active in the UK,although it sells in the US through Unisys.andP;  Kobine left the company in 1988to found Systems in Concert and work on a successor product that would solvethe problems of version one and address the much larger pc market that nowexists by running on DOS and over pc networks.andM;In the present: CalypsoandM;The new product, Calypso, works in DOS as a TSR (except in administrationmode), so users can keep their familiar applications and perform a variety oftasks beyond the capabilities of Calypso itself.andP;  The system routes tasksaccording to user instructions, and can make decisions on the basis of userdata, its own data, and factors such as the date and time.andP;  It keeps its ownmetadata -- transaction-logging, routings, the files and data required foreach step  in  xBASE (dBASE or a clone).andP;  It can load user applications and,with a little programming, move some data back and forth between the user'sapplications or to and from itself  - into a mail-merge file, say, or aspreadsheet, so that Alice can work on a letter that already includes thename of the customer entered by Juan in the previous step.andM;The programming  (&quot;instruction&quot;) process overall begins either with thegraphical layout of the steps or with the definition of each individual step- depending on your preferred approach.andP;  If you start with the sequencing,you build the sequence by placing boxes (from a palette) with a mouse inwhatever order you like, and connecting them with arrows.andP;  A single box canbranch into a number of steps (either concurrent or alternative), andmultiple steps can converge to a single one.andM;For each box, you fill in a form to specify the content of the step: who doesit, what applications and data files are needed (with variables for the filenames, records or key indexes if you want to bind the step to specific data).andO;This is the point where a programmer, or at least a DBASE expert, may step inif the routing is complex or the system needs to do more than just load anapplication and a file for the user.andP;  In addition, someone has to set up thenetwork and the user IDs.andP;  But an ordinary user could probably figure out howto send an expense-account spreadsheet through an approval cycle, from thespender to the sales manager to the accounting department.andM;In the future: Improv(izational) groupwareandM;Nonetheless, Calypso still doesn't qualify as our spreadsheet for groupware.andO;The fault lies not in the groupware tool, but in applications that areinaccessible except through cumbersome, cryptic APIs.andP;  Calypso is as far asanyone is going to get who doesn't own the system  - as Patriot Partnerswill, and as H-P's NewWave, ATandamp;T's Rhapsody (based on Workhorse and NewWaveand now also licensed to Xerox), IBM's officeVision and NCR's Cooperation doat least in part.andP;  (None of them has achieved it yet either; more on that ina future issue.)andM;Kobine is taking a pay-as-you-go approach to marketing.andP;  Right now, he'sselling direct to large customers, and hopes to expand his reach by usingdBASE consultants to sell and set up Calypso systems for smaller customers.andO;The system costs $5000 runtime and $10,000 for the developer version.andP;  FordBASE consultants, Calypso will be a good way to leverage their capabilities.andO;For groupware, Calypso is a good way to enter the market without looking too&quot;weird.&quot; And for users, it's a good way to increase not personalproductivity, but office productivity  - not more forecasts per hour, butmore customers handled per hour.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
