Since April 1985 alone, the rate has dropped 4.5 percentage points. The agency called this &quot;the largest and longest sustained drop in the rate in the 43-year history of the VA home loan program.&quot;    VA rates have been declining since late 1981, when they peaked at a record 17.5%, and in the past 21 months, the agency has cut the rate on fixed-rate home loans eight times.    The VA said declining rates continue to offer opportunities for homeowners to refinance their mortgages. Refinancing begins to make sense when market rates are two percentage points lower than the existing mortgage rate, the agency said.    Lower rates indicate a healthy confidence in the economy by banks and thrift institutions, according to VA Administrator Thomas Turnage. &quot;Lenders are demonstrating with lower rates that they need less margin for inflation in the years ahead,&quot; he said.    The VA also lowered three other rates by one-half percentage point. The maximum rate for graduated-payment mortgages dropped to 8.75%, the top rate for home improvement loans fell to 10%, and the rate for manufactured homes dropped to 11%. </TEXT></DOC>
