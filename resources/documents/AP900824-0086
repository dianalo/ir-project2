Leno asked Wednesday on ``The Tonight Show With JohnnyCarson.''   ``President Bush has frozen Iraq's assets and he's seeking theproper economic sanctions to punish them,'' Leno continued. ``Howabout putting all their assets in the savings and loans, thenthey'll be real sorry.''   The comic also made this observation: ``I notice we haven't hadany oil spills since it got so expensive.''   Roseanne Barr's name has also come up in connection with theMiddle East conflict.   The Washington gag goes that President Bush will name Miss BarrU.S. ambassador to Iraq, according to columnist Liz Smith.   Carson picked up the theme Thursday. He suggested the UnitedStates send over a secret weapon _ Miss Barr singing the Iraqinational anthem.   A new song by country singer Hank Williams Jr. _ ``Don't Give Usa Reason'' _ has been getting air time. One lyric goes:   ``And if you take some innocent lives, that's when the furreally flies,   ``Hey man, back off and get smart, don't give us a reason.   ``Don't give us a reason to come gunning for you,   ``Cuz the odds don't look so good, your neck is in a noose ...''   And what about a USO Tour to the Middle East? Television's``Entertainment Tonight'' says Hollywood celebrities are beinglined up for a trip, but the USO says names and details are beingkept secret for security reasons.   Bob Hope, who went to the Middle East several years ago with LeeGreenwood, Connie Stevens and others to entertain militarypersonnel, said he has no plans to take a USO Tour to Saudi Arabia.   ``Palm Springs is my desert,'' the 87-year-old Hope saidThursday. ``The only way I'm going to the desert is going to PalmSprings.''</TEXT></DOC>
