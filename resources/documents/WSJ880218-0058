In a surprise step, United Kingdom Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young announced Britain would issue licenses for as many as six new operators to supply specialized satellite services transmitting voice, data and video signals. He told the House of Lords the government would accept applications within about six weeks and name the six satellite operators in late April.    The action reflects the Conservative government's free-market philosophy, as well as an intense lobbying campaign by some U.S. satellite communications concerns.    Lord Young predicted the liberalization would encourage expansion of satellite-based telecommunications services here. Until now, only British Telecommunications PLC and Cable andamp; Wireless PLC's Mercury Communications Ltd. unit have been allowed to offer commercial services linking Britons by satellite to other nations. But Lord Young stressed the two firms' duopoly in basic telephone services would remain intact until a scheduled government review in 1990.    His decision maintains Britain's status as the most-open communications market in Europe, a region where government phone companies long have restricted competition in communications. Similar moves easing competition for satellite services aren't likely elsewhere in Europe, industry analysts said. </TEXT></DOC>
