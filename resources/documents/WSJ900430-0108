Because oil, gas and goodsno longer arrive, the factories cannot work normally. We havehad to lay off doctors. They have nothing to heal theirpatients with. We don't have basic drugs, even oxygen forsurgery is in short supply. There are no longer goods in theshops.                                                                                                          WSJ: What are the prospects for a peaceful negotiation?:   Up to now, Lithuania has been doing everything it can tostart negotiations and Moscow has refused. We are open tonegotiating everything except the restoration ofindependence. That would be like selling our mothers and ourfathers.                                                                                                          WSJ: From the Lithuanian point of view, what would be theminimum acceptable outcome from negotiations?:   The legal recognition of the March 11 declaration ofindependence. All the rest is negotiable in satisfying thevital interests of Lithuania, but also satisfying what Mr.Gorbachev considers to be the Soviet Union's vital interests.                                                                                                          WSJ: Do you think that you will gain your freedompeacefully?:   Of course. We have no other way. We have no army, noarmored force. Lithuania will negotiate everythingpeacefully. I was recently in the southern Caucasus republicsand there the situation is much more critical than in theBaltic states because there they are of a mind to use forceand they have the means to do it. They have the naturalboundaries, and they have the temperament.                                                                                                          WSJ: Before you declared independence did you believe youwould get greater Western support than you have received?:   Almost all Western countries did not recognize theannexation of the Baltic states to the Soviet Union. We wereconvinced the Western states would be consistent with theirformer position and would support an announcement ofrestoration of our independence. Due to the very weakposition taken by the West, Moscow is feeling much more freeto do whatever it wants not only in Lithuania but in all therepublics and especially in the treatment of other democraticforces in the Soviet Union. As you know the Soviet economicsituation is catastrophic. They are bankrupt. The position ofthe West will influence the internal political actions whichMoscow will take.                                                                                                          WSJ: What would be appropriate measures for the West totake?:   The West must accept the legality of the independence act.I don't think the West understands the internal politics ofthe Soviet Union. The West thinks that silence strengthensthe democratic forces but the exact opposite is true. If thesilence continues, you have to expect events very similar towhat happened in Romania. The difference is that you willhave assured the victory of the conservative forces in thiscivil war.   It is a complete mistake for the Bush administration tothink that Mr. Gorbachev is representative of democraticforces. Inside the Soviet Union, the democratic forces thinkexactly the opposite. A month ago, Mr. Gorbachev appointed aspecial board of advisers -- the most powerful body in theSoviet Union -- and he picked nothing but conservatives.There is not one democratic member on the board. From what wehave seen, it is clear that Mr. Gorbachev is legalizing hisdictatorship.                                                                                                          WSJ: If the West wanted to send aid in the form of fuel,medicine, etc. does Lithuania control a port of entry?:   Nowadays, all the borders on sea and land are controlledby not only the Red Army, but also the KGB army. They areconfiscating all the goods coming from other countries.Moscow confiscated all the currencies that belong to theLithuanian factories and enterprises. This is due to thecentralized banking system of the Soviet economy. There aretwo things that the Soviet Union will now openly dare to do:First, armed intervention -- the use of force; second,confiscating all the goods and humanitarian help that reachesthe borders from the West. We hope that this will become aninternational scandal.                                                                                                          WSJ: Russia is withholding fuel from Lithuania, andLithuania food from parts of Russia. Which side will feel themost pressure?:   We don't need anything from the Soviet Union. We just wishthat they would stop the blockade. Before World War II theeconomy of Lithuania was completely Western-oriented. Ourstandard of living was the same as Denmark. Look at whereDenmark is today, and look at us. Of course now we need thecommerce from the East and we would like to preserve thiscommercial relationship and to develop it as I would ourrelationship with other republics in the Soviet Union. I havereceived a lot of offers from regional authorities, fromother cities in the Soviet Union -- Leningrad, Lvov, etc. --to support Lithuania but because of the army, they can't.                                                                                                          WSJ: Do you agree with Mr. Gorbachev's view that Lithuaniaowes the Soviet Union financially for its support the past 50years?:   When the Soviet Union first occupied Lithuania, thestandard of living was much higher than in Russia. The outputand productivity gains of Lithuania during the 50-year periodwere always higher than any other republic. Capitalinvestment put back into Lithuania was only the average ofwhat all the republics received, so clearly we received lessfor what we produced. Between 1941 and 1952 we lost 15% ofour population, 300,000 people were forcibly deported toSiberia to work outside of their homeland.                                                                                                          WSJ: So when it comes right down to it, you don't thinkyou owe them anything:   Right. We have been a Western country that has beenoccupied for 50 years.                                                                                                          WSJ: How are the Lithuanians prepared to cope?:   It is very difficult to make plans because all the bordersare controlled by the KGB border guards. They can make acrackdown with blood at any time and we are trying to breakthe blockade by any peaceful means available. We are alsohere to try to get very urgent humanitarian aid.                                                                                                          WSJ: Do you really think that the KGB will let thishumanitarian aid in after letting nothing else in so far?:   We must try. If the KGB confiscates these goods andhumanitarian aid, then it will be a shame not only for theSoviet Union but also for all the Western countries. Thephysicians have no medicine, we especially need the medicine.As soon as we can, we are trying to convert all of theinternal production to try to produce some of the goods beingheld out by the blockade. I think you should understand thatthe blockade is not only keeping things out, but there is aninternal blockade as well. All the internal traffic,especially on the railways and roads is blocked. If ourconversion is to succeed, our first goal is to get petrol. Wehave some reserves, but not much.                                                                                                          WSJ: And the general public is willing to sacrifice likethis? What would happen if two weeks from now, the peoplesaid, &quot;Enough. We can't take this any more&quot;?:   That is a statement that will only be issued by Moscow,not by the Lithuanian people. The day before this delegationcame here, we received over a thousand phone calls saying,&quot;`Please hold your position. We are ready to supporteverything.&quot; Please take into account that this is not astruggle that just started on March 11. This is a struggle of50 years. And as deep as the pressure is from Moscow, so isthe determination of the Lithuanian people.                                                                                                          WSJ: We have received reports that officials fromLithuania's government are being sent out of the country toform an international network, in case there is a seriouscrackdown and the independence movement is struck down:   Powers have been given to some of the former ambassadorswho were in place before World War II to continue to doeverything that is suitable to regain independence forLithuania. But no new leaders are involved. We have agovernment-in-exile set up in case Lithuania is annexed asecond time or the West recognizes the first annexation,which in fact is what they are doing right now.                                                                                                          WSJ: If you could speak directly to Mr. Bush and theAmerican people, what would you say?:   Mr. Bush, the stability of the Eastern nations is in yourhands. Please be careful.</TEXT></DOC>
