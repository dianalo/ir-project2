(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A businessman charged in the Pentagoncorruption scandal acknowledged Friday that a private consultanthis firm had hired for $150,000 did nothing in return for theinitial installments on the contract.   Dale Schnittjer, a former vice president of Teledyne Electronicsof Newbury Park, Calif., made the admission under cross-examinationin U.S. District Court as the defense wound up its case.   Schnittjer and two other former Teledyne executives, George Kauband Eugene Sullivan, are charged with bribery, conspiracy and wirefraud in the first trial stemming from the federal government's``Ill Wind'' investigation, in which authorities are looking intofraud and kickbacks at the Pentagon.   U.S. District Judge Richard Williams dismissed the jury atmid-day, instructing them to return Monday to hear closingarguments before the deliberations begin. The trial began Monday.   Schnittjer, the final defendant to take the stand, said he neverknew that William Parkin, a private consultant Teledyne Electronicshad hired in October 1985, had paid bribes to a Navy engineer forconfidential information about a $24 million contract for hand-heldradar equipment. Sullivan and Kaub also said they were kept in thedark about Parkin's activities.   Parkin and Stuart Berlin, the engineer, are among those whopleaded guilty in the case before the trial began. They testifiedfor the government.   Schnittjer, who joined Teledyne Electronics in the summer of1987, around the time the company was awarded the radar contract,said Parkin's deal with Teledyne called for him to receive $10,000in up-front month.   If Teledyne won the contract, the company agreed to sign asub-contract with Parkin for $150,000. ``We was supposed to workfor the sub-contract,'' Schnittjer said.   Under questioning by Assistant U.S. attorney Jack Hanley,however, Schnittjer acknowledged that Parkin did not produce anywork in exchange for the roughly $18,000 he received in early 1988.   Schnittjer said, however, that Teledyne officials had discussedhaving Parkin complete a report on avionics.   Parkin's payments were stopped after the government'sinvestigation was made public in June 1988.   Parkin's contract was terminated ``when we learned that Parkindidn't appear to be what he was,'' Schnittjer said.   In a related matter, Joseph E. Hill, 76, of Mineola, N.Y., wassentenced to one year of unsupervised probation and fined $20,000for making illegal campaign contributions to congressionalcampaigns. Hill, a private consultant, pleaded guilty to the fourmisdemeanor counts earlier this year.   He has admitted that he channeled corporate contributions to thecampaigns of unwitting congressional candidates as part of a schemeorganized by several former executives of Unisys Corp. Hill is oneof about a dozen people who have pleaded guilty in the Pentagoninvestigation.</TEXT></DOC>
