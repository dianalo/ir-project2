By winning nearly70% of the vote, he gained strong approval from the nation'swhites for his efforts to integrate blacks into a democraticpolitical system. There is no clear certainty that the wholeenterprise will not collapse into chaos and furtherbloodshed. But his chances will be greatly improved if he canacquire two more things: unqualified support from the U.S.and Europe, and willingness among South Africa's politiciansto discard the statism of South Africa's past.   The hope now is that Mr. de Klerk's pledge to work towarda multiparty, nonracial democracy will bring similarcommitments from the 18 other parties that make up theConvention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). At thispoint, Nelson Mandela's reaction to the vote is thatapartheid is &quot;very much alive.&quot; To make democracy happen,however, the parties should consider what the &quot;yes&quot; vote said&quot;no&quot; to. It meant no to violence, no to extremism and no toisolation. Most important, South Africa's 3.3 million whitevoters said no to the Conservative Party's idea for new,improved social engineering -- this time, perhaps, a whitehomeland instead of white neighborhoods. No more, said thevoters.</LP><TEXT>   As South Africa moves away from apartheid as a social andpolitical system, it needs to move away from apartheideconomics as well. That won't be easy; one out of every threewhites, for example, is employed either by the government orstate industries. Black politicians would surely like tostart playing the patronage game as well. Of the 800,000young people entering the work force this year, fewer than10% can expect to find full-time jobs, so the temptation forstate featherbedding will be high.   Yet, as the peoples of a country with four major languagesand dozens of ethnic groups find political expression, a biggovernment is likely to become a target of resentment. Abetter option for Mr. de Klerk, Mr. Mandela and the others atCodesa to consider is a federal system in which mostdecisions are made at the local level -- &quot;one man, manyvotes&quot; as South African author Leon Louw puts it. Federalismwould tend to marginalize the extremists. Left-wing blackswhose philosophy is &quot;one settler, one bullet&quot; are unlikely topick up new followers if blacks begin to exercise politicalcontrol close to home. Backward-looking whites are lesslikely to find a federal system less threatening to theirinterests.   In short, to dismantle the legacy of apartheid meanspeeling away the layers of state control that kept it inplace. But there is little reason for South Africa to openits economy if no one is willing to walk in. After ageneration of demonizing South Africa, the West should exertequal energy toward making the transition work. Some 26 ofAmerica's 50 states still impose economic sanctions on SouthAfrica, as well as dozens of local governments anduniversities. There can no longer be any rationale for this.   South Africa offers lots of reasons to be pessimistic, butthere also are reasons for hope. All during the referendumcampaign, Codesa continued to meet; within the next year,South Africa will probably have an interim government thatincludes blacks. Nearly 70% of Tuesday's voters were willingto face a new future. It is a future that the West shouldsupport with at least the same fervor it employed inopposition to South Africa's apartheid past.</TEXT></DOC>
