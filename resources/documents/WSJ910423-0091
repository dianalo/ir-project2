But since then, the huge shocks then rattlingbankers and bank investors seem to have subsided, some bankearnings have been better than expected, and the stocks havesurged.   Is the crisis over?</LP><TEXT>   &quot;In October, the market incorrectly believed that thestability of the financial system was in jeopardy,&quot; says EricI. Hemel, an analyst at First Boston Corp.   &quot;There's been a dramatic reversal in psychology,&quot; saysJames J. McDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyette andamp; WoodsInc., a securities firm specializing in bank and thriftstocks. &quot;The industry was perceived to be on death's door inthe fall of 1990. There were heavy comparisons to the savingsand loan industry. There were questions about whichmoney-center bank was going to fail.&quot;   Suddenly, it's hard to find investors and analysts whoaren't bullish on banks, even banks with bad earnings.Candamp;S/Sovran Corp., a Southeastern banking giant, recentlyreported that first-quarter net income plunged 72%, thecharge for expected loan losses more than doubled, andnonperforming loans surged 57% to $1.1 billion. But over thenext two days, Candamp;S/Sovran's stock jumped $2.75 a share, or15%, in heavy trading.   Since last October, the Dow Jones index of eightmoney-center bank stocks has gained 52%, more than twice the25% rise in the overall market. And major banks' new stockissues, which ground to a halt in the fourth quarter, surgedto nearly $1 billion of common stock and $1.7 billion ofpreferred stock in the first quarter.   Yesterday, demonstrating that savvy outside investors arewilling to pay up to get into the industry, the team ofleveraged buy-out specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.and Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc. won the bidding forfailed Bank of New England, beating out BankAmerica Corp. andBank of Boston Corp.   Behind the change in outlook lies more than a shift ininvestor psychology. The Federal Reserve's push to lowershort-term interest rates has helped many banks, whose costof deposits have dropped faster than their income from loans.Cost cutting, especially at behemoths such as Citicorp andChase Manhattan Corp., is taking hold and should liftprofits. Nonperforming assets -- soured loans and foreclosedreal estate -- are still growing at many banks, but theyaren't growing as fast as before. And if the economy soonswings from recession into recovery, big banks' problems willease significantly.   Federal Reserve Board Governor John P. LaWare, a formerBoston banker, believes bank earnings hit bottom in eitherthe fourth quarter of last year or the first quarter of thisyear. &quot;I'm encouraged because I think the pace of increase innonperforming loans has slowed for the most part. I alsothink we're beginning to see, as we did with Chase, theimpact of expense reductions. The combination of those twothings is in the right direction.&quot;   Wall Street's changed perception of bank regulators isanother factor. Last year, after regulators forced big loanwrite-downs at a slew of banks, mostly in the Northeast,bankers and analysts feared that the examiners were out todestroy the industry. Since then, some bankers say theirexaminers aren't being as harsh. Regulators agree. Theyexplain that now they have got bankers' attention.   &quot;Last year we went through a period of denial with thebankers,&quot; says Karen Wilson, deputy comptroller of thecurrency for the Northeast region. &quot;We said there was aproblem; they said there wasn't. By the end of the year, theysaid you were more right than we were. We've been goingthrough an education process.&quot;   Pressure from regulators and worried investors also forcedmany banks to raise their capital; now, the additionalcapital is available to absorb future loan losses. Andregulators have proposed new, more-lenient accounting rulesfor some problem loans, easing the perception that theregulators are on the warpath.   But Wall Street may be breaking out the champagne toosoon. The rebound in bank profits could be slowed bycontinuing weakness in commercial real estate, on which bankshave lent $360 billion. Also troublesome could be more than$68 billion of loans to debt-heavy companies, many of whichwent through leveraged buy-outs, and $50 billion of ThirdWorld loans.   Charles Peabody, a Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. analyst stillbearish on many big banks, sees &quot;no fundamental support forthe rally we've been in. It's mind-boggling what hashappened. I'm perplexed.&quot;   John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp, which has about $17billion of commercial real-estate loans on its books, toldhis shareholders last week, &quot;we recognize that thereal-estate market continues to weaken and that it is notlikely to recover for quite some time.&quot; Mr. Reed added toreporters that he had personally checked the commercialreal-estate loan portfolio about three weeks ago and foundthat appraised values, which are reviewed every six months,are still falling.   First Boston's Mr. Hemel likewise sees &quot;no signs of aturnaround in commercial real estate. Rents are declining inmany markets; rents aren't increasing in any market to myknowledge. The nationwide commercial vacancy rate is 20%, andit will stay that way for a year or two and will come downvery slowly.&quot;   Bankers also warn that nonperforming commercial loans tendto rise for several quarters after an economic recoverybegins. And at many big banks, nonperforming assets are stillincreasing. But some analysts are hopeful because the rate ofincrease is slowing; fewer loans are going bad each quarter.   Citicorp, for example, had a $1.1 billion increase innonperforming assets in the 1990 third quarter and a $900million increase in the fourth. In January, Thomas E. Jones,a Citicorp executive vice president, predicted thatnonperforming assets would increase an additional $1 billionin the first quarter. But last week, Citicorp said they roseonly $750 million. Mr. Jones expects the increases innonperforming assets to keep dwindling.   Similarly, Chase Manhattan's nonperforming assets,excluding loans to less-developed countries, increased $458million in last year's second quarter, $413 million in thethird quarter and $532 million in the fourth quarter. But inthe first quarter, they increased only $317 million.   Another big risk for banks concerns consumers. If thewidely anticipated economic recovery does begin aroundmidyear, employment, consumer spending and loan demand couldturn upward by year end. If the economy doesn't recover,however, defaults on consumer loans, especially on creditcards, will keep rising.   Although credit-card lending remains profitable, ChaseManhattan, the nation's second-largest credit-card issuerafter Citicorp, said its losses on credit-card loans rose to4.12% of loans outstanding in the first quarter from 3.5% inthe fourth quarter and 3.27% for all last year. Evenhigh-income consumers feel pinched. American Express Co.,which set aside $50 million more than usual for credit lossesin the first quarter, said most of the provision was forlosses on credit extended to its Gold Card and Platinum Cardcustomers.   Loans to countries such as Brazil and Argentina alsoremain a problem. U.S. bank regulators last week orderedbanks to write down $11.4 billion of Brazilian loans to 60%of their principal amount from the previous carrying value of80%; $3.5 billion of Argentinian loans will be written downto 30% of their face amount from 40%.   Bankers hope current loan-loss reserves can absorb thewrite-downs and don't want to set aside additional reserves,which would reduce second-quarter profit. Whether regulatorswill agree isn't clear.   Finally, the cost of keeping solvent the Bank InsuranceFund, formerly known as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,will fall heavily on the industry. Deposit-insurancepremiums, which ran 12 cents per $100 of domestic depositslast year, increased to 19.5 cents on Jan. 1 and arescheduled to increase to 23 cents on July 1 to repay $10billion that the fund plans to borrow. The Bushadministration has proposed another increase, to as much as30 cents per $100 of domestic deposits, to replenish thefund.   Last fall, the woes of the deposit-insurance fund, whichsome economists said might require a $50 billion bailout,were hurting bank stocks. Now that the administration hasproposed a long-term refunding rather than a huge one-timeassessment, investors aren't as nervous.   &quot;The way the FDIC crisis is being funded results in a verymoderate earnings impact stretched out over a very longperiod of time,&quot; says Mr. Hemel of First Boston. &quot;They're notgoing to pay for it this year or next year. Literally in the21st century, we'll be paying for the problems of the 1980s.&quot;   In the past year, meanwhile, the Federal Reserve rescuedbig banks by bringing down short-term interest rates morethan two percentage points. That has reduced the cost ofdeposits for most banks, which haven't lowered loan rates asmuch. The prime rate, the basic rate on loans to business,has fallen only one percentage point, to 9%.   As a result, net interest margins -- the differencebetween the average cost of deposits and average yield onloans and other assets -- have generally widened. At ChemicalBanking Corp., the nation's sixth-largest bank holdingcompany, the net interest margin increased to 3.51% in thefirst quarter from 3.02% a year earlier, and Chemical'sprofit from the interest-rate spread climbed $67.1 million,or 14%.   At Chase, the net interest margin widened to 3.83% in thefirst quarter from 3.43% a year earlier, and net interestincome surged to $824 million from $788 million. Citicorp'snet interest margin, adjusted for sales of credit-card loanspackaged into securities, rose to 4.07%.   Cost cutting also is being pushed hard at some big banks.Though Citicorp's $2.5 billion in operating expenses in thequarter far exceeded any other banking company's, the totalwas $386 million less than that in the fourth quarter(excluding a $300 million charge for severance pay in thefourth period). Mr. Reed said Citicorp is ahead of scheduleon its goal of cutting annual costs by $1.5 billion.   Chase's operating expenses fell to $936 million in thefirst quarter from $952 million a year earlier; they alsowere down from a peak of $994 million in last year's secondquarter. Most of the cost cutting at Chase, as at otherbanks, involved layoffs. Chase's employment has dropped to39,180 from 43,400 last June 30.   Cost cutting may be further facilitated by the widelyanticipated consolidation of the industry. And if banks areallowed to have branches in more than one state -- a part ofthe Treasury's bank-overhaul plan now before Congress --holding companies that currently operate separate banks inseveral states could save money.   Long-term bank shareholders, who are sitting on big paperlosses, hope the rally continues. Shares of several New Yorkbanks, which have rebounded sharply from their lows of lastOctober, are trading at only half the highs reached inOctober 1989. Chase's shares, for example, have nearlydoubled to $18.875 from their low of $9.75 last October butare far below their high of $44.875 a year earlier. Citicorpshares have gained 43% from their low of $10.75 last Octoberbut are less than half their October 1989 high of $35.50.</TEXT></DOC>
