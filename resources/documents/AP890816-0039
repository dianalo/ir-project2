(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The second explosion of asubmarine-launched Trident 2 missile in five months could againdelay Navy plans to send its newest, deadliest weapon on operationalpatrol.   The original December target was put off until March 1990 by thefirst failure. Now the March goal is in jeopardy.   One of the 44-foot, $23.7 million missiles exploded Tuesdayseconds after it was launched from the nuclear submarine Tennesseewhile it cruised submerged about 200 miles southeast of CapeCanaveral.   The Navy said the blowup caused no injuries nor did it damage thesubmarine or a nearby support ship.   Officials said the problem occurred shortly after the missilecleared the surface and ignited, reminiscent of the first Trident 2submarine launch on March 21. That missile blew apart four secondsafter it was launched by the crew of the Tennessee.   Investigators traced the problem in March to a mechanical linkageresponsible for moving the rocket steering nozzles back and forth.The faulty part was redesigned.   On Aug. 2, the Tennessee launched a Trident 2 with the designchanges on the missile's first underwater success, and Navy hopeswere buoyed.   There was no immediate indication whether the two failures wererelated, and officials said they won't know exactly what went wrongTuesday until they study radio telemetry tapes of the missile'sbehavior.   There was no immediate assessment of what impact the latestfailure will have on the Trident 2 operational schedule. The firstfailure set back the plan three months.   The Navy had planned about six more underwater tests beforesending the Tennessee on operational patrol in March with 24 of thenuclear-tipped weapons. Nine Trident 2 submarines are planned.   Each missile is capable of propelling as many as 10 nuclearwarheads to different targets more than 4,600 miles away.   Nineteen Trident 2s were test-fired from a land launch pad beforesea trials began. The Navy rated 15 of them successful.</TEXT></DOC>
