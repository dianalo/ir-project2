Following a speech to a group of business reporters, Mr. Johnson said he didn't believe it would be &quot;useful&quot; for the dollar to decline further. But he said that such a decline &quot;in and of itself is not inflationary,&quot; and therefore doesn't necessarily require tighter credit in the U.S.    Instead, Mr. Johnson said, Japan and Germany should take action to lower their interest rates -- a move that could also boost the dollar's value.    Mr. Johnson's comments put him at loggerheads with the head of the West German central bank, Karl Otto Poehl, who said Monday that the Fed should push U.S. interest rates higher to attract &quot;the substantial net capital inflows needed to finance the large current-account deficits.&quot;    Treasury officials declined to comment on Mr. Poehl's call for higher U.S. interest rates. But a Fed official said the Federal Reserve system has already done some of what Mr. Poehl suggested and that it would be counterproductive to push further. He said that at this point West Germany and Japan need to ease rates.    Mr. Johnson's comments also seemed to vary somewhat from those of Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, who has warned repeatedly that further declines in the dollar could spark inflation in the U.S.    Separately, Fed nominee Edward Kelley said that the dollar is at an appropriate level and that he hoped it will &quot;settle out at a level around where it is now.&quot; At a confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking committee, he also expressed concern that the U.S. currency's fall has been &quot;disorderly and somewhat disruptive.&quot;    The committee is expected to approve Mr. Kelley's nomination soon. He will fill the vacancy created by the Dec. 31 resignation of Emmett Rice.    The Fed has tightened monetary policy somewhat in recent weeks, according to Chairman Volcker, pushing some short-term interest rates higher. Mr. Johnson said yesterday he supported that move as an effort to head off fear in the financial markets over future inflation. But he added that despite that fear in the financial markets, &quot;there aren't strong inflationary pressures out there.&quot;    Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told President Reagan last week that he has ordered his country's finance ministry and central bank to lower short-term interest rates. And West Germany is also considering a modest cut in a key central bank interest rate. Mr. Johnson's comments suggested, however, that more may be needed from both nations.    As the Fed's No. 2 official, Mr. Johnson has been influential in determining central bank policy in recent months. His comments yesterday suggest a strong reluctance to push U.S. interest rates higher to support the dollar.    In explaining his position, Mr. Johnson said that if the Fed &quot;is on course with domestic policy,&quot; a drop in the dollar caused by tight monetary policies abroad isn't inflationary. While import prices might rise in such a situation, they would be offset by declines in other prices, so the overall inflation rate would stay unchanged.    Other economists disagreed with that analysis, however. Alan Greenspan, a New York economic consultant who is frequently mentioned as a possible successor to Chairman Volcker, said Mr. Johnson's argument may be true in the long run, but that in the short run a rapid drop in the dollar &quot;will result in higher prices&quot; overall.    Higher interest rates in the U.S. prop up the dollar by luring foreign investors to put their money into U.S. financial investments. Lower interest rates overseas can have the same effect by making investments in those countries less attractive.    At his confirmation hearing, Mr. Kelley also said that he is concerned about rising import prices and hopes U.S. producers won't take advantage of the lower dollar to raise prices. In response to a question by Banking committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.), Mr. Kelley also said he is concerned that sharp rises in the money supply last year could lead to higher inflation.    But he said that money-supply growth has slowed this year and that the economy isn't showing signs of a major inflationary resurgence. &quot;I don't presently see things that would indicate that we are in danger of setting off&quot; a new inflationary surge, he said. He noted that there's an absence of industrial capacity constraints and commodity shortages and that labor costs remain under control.    On other matters, he called for allowing banks to move further into such fields as the underwriting of mortgage-backed securities, which aren't directly related to banking, and for granting additional banking powers to commercial institutions. But he emphasized that such deregulation must be accomplished in a way that maintains the integrity and safety of the financial system.    Mr. Kelley, 54 years old, is a Houston investment counselor and lifelong friend of of Treasury Secretary James Baker. </TEXT></DOC>
