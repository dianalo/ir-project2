Asahi said the secretary bought the shares at around 3,000 yen ($23.89) each, and sold them about one month after they began to trade for 5,200 yen each. Asahi said the shares earned the secretary, Kozo Murata, a little more than 20 million yen ($159,000).    Mr. Shinto denied the reports at a news conference yesterday. Mr. Shinto said he had asked Mr. Murata if he had bought shares of the Recruit Co. unit and had received Mr. Murata's assurances that he hadn't.    The disclosure follows accusations by Japan's opposition parties that a number of influential politicians and journalists profited from the sale of Recruit Cosmos shares bought before the shares began to trade publicly in 1986. Aides to some politicians have admitted to buying the shares.    An NTT official in the corporate communications division, Ei Shikiba, has admitted to owning 5,000 Recruit Cosmos shares he bought before the shares were registered. </TEXT></DOC>
