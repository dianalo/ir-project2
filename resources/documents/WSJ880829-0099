The transactions boosted the number of thrifts closed or merged by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to 87 this year, 31 of them in the past two weeks. Friday's merger crop included the first one arranged on a promising fast-track bidding program that some Bank Board staffers call &quot;McDeals.&quot; That transaction took less than three months from soliciting bids to closing, about half the average time.    The board estimated its cost of assisting the mergers at all 10 institutions at $948.5 million.    The largest of the new transactions sends State Federal Savings andamp; Loan of Lubbock, Lubbock, Texas, to MeraBank, based in Phoenix, Ariz. State Federal's assets of $454 million were outweighed by its negative net worth of $480 million, even by relatively lax regulatory accounting. Net worth is assets minus liabilities. The Bank Board agreed to provide an estimated $585 million of financial assistance to MeraBank.    State Federal will be absorbed into MeraBank Texas, a MeraBank subsidiary based in El Paso, which in June acquired First Financial-A Savings Association, El Paso, and Brownfield Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Brownfield.    The first &quot;McDeal&quot; was Northwest Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Boise, Idaho. The thrift, with $26.7 million in assets, will be acquired by Washington Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Seattle. Bidding on that institution was closed 21 days before the deal was closed. Bank Board Chairman Danny Wall has said he has acceptable bids on 13 more of the 21 thrifts first offered in the accelerated program. The Bank Board provided about $2.4 million in assistance.    Elsewhere, the Bank Board turned over five insolvent Minnesota thrifts and one Iowa institution to a unit of Metropolitan Financial Corp., Fargo, N.D. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. provided an assistance package estimated at $299 million. The six thrifts had combined assets of $1.09 billion and liabilities of $1.32 billion.    The Minnesota Sandamp;Ls are First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Brainerd; First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Hibbing; First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Grand Rapids; Washington Federal Savings Bank, Stillwater; and Peoples Savings andamp; Loan Association, Owatonna. The Iowa thrift is Pioneer Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Mason City.    Also approved was the acquisition of Homestate Savings andamp; Loan Association, Hayward, Calif. by Old Stone Bank of California, a subsidiary of Old Stone Corp., Providence, R.I. The Bank Board provided assistance of $44.7 million in cash and other assistance that wasn't assigned a price. Homestate Savings had assets of $190 million.    Commerce Federal Savings Bank, Knoxville, Tenn., was acquired by Security Trust Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Oak Ridge, with $17.4 million in financial assistance. Commerce Federal had assets of $40.2 million and liabilities of $54.7 million. </TEXT></DOC>
