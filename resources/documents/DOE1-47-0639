The positive diagnosis is uneasy because of non-specificclinical features and frequent negative blood cultures. Splenic localisationis the most likely. Citrate Gallium scintigraphy together with spleniclabelled RBC scan enables us to give a precise view of the splenic involvmentand even of the abdominal extension of the fungal abscess. From the literaturereview and these two cases, the excellent adequacy of the scintigraphyto the follow-up of systemic candidiasis is underlined and is comparedto other usual morphological studies such as US scan and CT examination.In both cases, the diagnosis is fully confirmed by mycological examination.</TEXT></DOC>
