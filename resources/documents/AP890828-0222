Kidder's previous books were ``House,'' about the practical andemotional complexities of building a house, and ``The Soul of a NewMachine,'' the Pulitzer Prize-winning story of the creation of a newminicomputer.   ``For me, this book has much more heart than any other one Iwrote and it's certainly the most important subject,'' Kidder saidof his latest work. ``It was the least mundane subject. It's allabout the awakening of minds.''   Kidder interviewed a number of teachers in Holyoke, Mass., beforesettling on Zajac, a 34-year-old native of the small, ethnicallydiverse mill town. ``I wasn't looking for one of those mythicalsuperstars,'' he said. ``I don't even know if those people exist,the miracle workers. But I did want a good teacher.''   ``Among Schoolchildren'' (Houghton Mifflin, $18.95), culled from10,000 pages of notes, is broadened somewhat by digressions into thehistory of Holyoke, corporal punishment, education reform andteaching. Kidder also follows Zajac to Puerto Rico, homeland of manyof her students. But most of the action is focused tightly in theclassroom.   Zajac is depicted as a teacher of enormous energy and compassion,someone deeply affected by the ups and downs of a very volatile jobwho all too often wakes at midnight haunted by a child's desperatesituation or her own failure to make a difference.   We meet her on the first day of class at Kelly School, layingdown the law. ``Mrs. Zajac gives homework ... The only meanie giveshomework,'' she tells them. ``If you put your name on a paper, youshould be proud of it. ... If it isn't your best, what's Mrs. Zajacgoing to do? Make you do it over.''   Of his first impressions, Kidder recalls, ``She seemed so strictto me. I thought, gosh, this isn't the way a teacher ought to be.''He soon revised his opinion. ``She was not mean, not cruel. She wastrying to very quickly get control of her room. ... I don't thinkthe kids were as daunted by her as I was. She really grew on me,though. It wasn't very long before I realized how good she was.''   Zajac's students ranged from Alice and Judith, very bright girlsat opposite ends of the economic spectrum, to Clarence and Robert,emotionally disturbed children from deprived and possibly abusivebackgrounds.   The days are sprinkled with some rewards _ Judith's compellingessay on her family's move from a pleasant house to a periloushousing project, an inspired lesson on the American Revolution, achronic underachiever's good test performance.   But to many readers, if not to Zajac, those moments may beovershadowed by the children's problems and the strain of teachingthem.   There was the learning disabled boy whose grandmother sent back asuicide note instead of an agreement to meet with his teacher; theimpossibly obnoxious boy who once wrote in class, ``Dear Dad were doyou live I want to come and see you I love you but the only thing isdo you love me''; the science fair projects that revealed suchtragic disparities in the home lives of her students that Zajac gotall future fairs canceled.   Zajac also had to deal with youngsters who repeatedly came toschool with less than six hours' sleep, those who never didhomework, those who constantly misbehaved and disrupted the class,those who may have been abused.   At year's end, nevertheless, she is satisfied that some of herchildren have made progress and reinvigorated by her decision toteach sixth grade rather than fifth the following year.   Would anyone go into teaching after reading this book? Kidder,whose mother taught English for more than 20 years, said he himselfwondered that. He does not disguise his impatience with the low pay,lack of respect and poor working conditions teachers must endure, orthe high-minded reform efforts that he says ``seem to leave teachersright out of the equation.''   But Kidder believes his book, as it weaves through the sunshineand shadow of Zajac's year, illuminates more than the hardships ofteaching.   ``You feel useful in the world. You're clearly needed by yourlittle clients. There are tremendous possibilities for joyfulwork,'' he said. ``It is an incredibly difficult job, but it has alovely side to it that I think will continue to attract people.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Sept 8-10</NOTE></DOC>
