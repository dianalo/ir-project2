Elders Investments will be capitalized with $500 million of equity, said Elders IXL's chairman, John Elliott, who was speaking to a group of businessmen in Toronto, where Elders IXL acquired a brewery earlier this year. Elders IXL is based in Melbourne, Australia, and is one of that country's biggest companies.    The stock, which will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, will be offered to investors in Japan, Europe and Australia, Mr. Elliott said.    Elders Investments will hold all of Elders IXL's interests outside its four core businesses, which include brewing, agriculture, finance and natural resources, Mr. Elliott said.    Additional details of Elders' plans for the new unit will be released today in New York, he said.    Elders IXL recently announced a corporate restructuring in which three of its main operating units will be spun off as separate companies. At the same time, Elders announced its plan to form Elders Investments as well. </TEXT></DOC>
