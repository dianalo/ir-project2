The justices, by a 7-2 vote, rejected arguments that Bundy, 42,was mentally incompetent when he stood trial in 1980 for the slayingof a 12-year-old girl in Lake City, Fla.   Within an hour of the high court's action, Florida officials saidBundy would be executed Tuesday at 7 a.m. under a death warrantsigned by Gov. Bob Martinez.   Bundy has also received death sentences for the 1978 killings oftwo Florida State University sorority sisters who were beaten andstrangled just three weeks before the Lake City murder.   He has been linked to as many as 36 sex murders or disappearancesof young women, most of them in Utah, Colorado and Washington state.   Bundy, whose case was depicted in a television miniseries named``The Deliberate Stranger,'' previously has come within hours ofbeing executed only to win postponement.   Tuesday's order marked the fourth time the Supreme Court hasconsidered a formal appeal involving one of his convictions or deathsentences.   ``We hope justice can now be served in this case,'' FloridaAttorney General Robert Butterworth said.   After signing the death warrant, Martinez called Bundy ``one ofthe most notorious killers in our nation's history'' who ``has usedlegal manueverings to dodge the electric chair for 10 years.''   ``Justice has been on hold for a decade,'' Martinez said, ``andit's about time Ted Bundy paid for his crimes.''   But James Coleman Jr., one of the Washington lawyers representingBundy, said, ``We will seek to stay the execution, ... perhaps asearly as tomorrow.''   Coleman said he planned to file an emergency appeal in Floridastate court. ``If we do not win a stay in the state courts, I expectwe will be back in federal court,'' he said, declining to disclosewhat legal theory would be advanced.   In the appeal acted on Tuesday, lawyers for Bundy argued thatlower courts wrongly determined at a much later date that he hadbeen competent to stand trial in 1980 for the 1978 killing ofKimberly Leach.   Referring to numerous incidents in which Bundy exhibited bizarrebehavior during his trial, the appeal maintained that Bundy had beenmentally incompetent at the time.   ``This court has never addressed the issue of when, if ever, a(post-trial)hearing would be adequate to remedy a violation of adefendant's right ... to a contemporary determination of hiscompetency when sufficient (indications) arise at trial,'' theappeal said.   The Supreme Court in 1966 said defendants have a right to such a``contemporary'' competency hearing.   A federal judge in 1986 ruled that Bundy had been competent in1980, calling him ``the most competent serial killer in the countryat this time ... a diabolical genius.''   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the competencyruling.   The Leach girl disappeared from a junior high school on Feb. 9,1978. Her body was found in an abandoned pig sty.   Prosecutors said that on the night of Jan. 15, 1978, Bundyentered a Chi Omega sorority house on the Florida State campus andattacked four coeds, killing two and seriously injuring two.   Margaret Bowman and Lisa Levy, attacked as they slept, werekilled.   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, who opposecapital punishment under all circumstances, voted to overturnBundy's death sentence.   In other matters Tuesday, the court:   _Turned down the appeals of four California death row inmates,including a man linked to the sex slayings of four boys inCalifornia, Texas, West Virginia and New Jersey.   _Ruled, by a 6-3 vote, that a California redistricting plan thatplaced Democrats in firm control of the state's congressionaldelegation is not an unlawful form of political gerrymandering.   _Let stand a ruling in a case from Boston that allowsanti-smoking groups to see and publicize a cigarette company'sresearch that the groups say could link smoking to health hazards.   _Rejected a challenge to a Virginia law exempting religiouslyaffiliated child-care centers from some health and safetyregulations all other child-care centers must meet.</TEXT></DOC>
