His 88-minute speech, broadcast on national radio and television,marked the 16th anniversary of the coup he led on Sept. 11, 1973,that left hundreds dead. He is scheduled to surrender power to anelected civilian government next March.   As he spoke, riot police used water cannons and tear gas toscatter scores of demonstrators trying to enter Santiago's GeneralCemetery to mourn the casualties of the anti-leftist repression thatfollowed the coup. There were no reports of arrests.   But people were arrested during two anti-Pinochet demonstrationsin Vina del Mar and Iquique.   The coup ousted the elected government of elected MarxistPresident Salvador Allende, and Allende died during the finalassault on the presidential palace in central Santiago.   As in past years, several thousand people gathered to honorAllende at his grave in the Santa Ines Cemetery in Vina del Mar, 75miles northwest of Santiago.   Police did not interfere with the ceremony but fired watercannons and tear gas to scatter demonstrators who tried to marchdowntown. Witnesses saw several marchers detained but police gave noreport.   Radio Cooperativa reported about 100 people were detained duringdisturbances in Iquique, 1,100 miles north of Santiago. No otherinformation was available.   There were conflicting reports about Allende's death. Somesupporters said he was killed by troops who broke into his office. Agovernment report said he committed suicide with a carbine that wasa gift from Cuban President Fidel Castro.   Pinochet, a 73-year-old general who commands the army, said inhis address the armed forces will not allow a civilian government tobring back ``the demagogic policies'' that he said brought the coup.   Wearing his army uniform with the white, red and bluepresidential sash, he said economic progress under hisadministration has placed Chile ``very close to the most advancednations.''   Toward the end of his speech, with his voice breaking and hiseyes brimming with tears, he spoke of ``the unfair criticism'' hehas received and the attempt to kill him three years ago.   ``In spite of all this, we would do it again if necessary, evenif we had to offer our own lives,'' he said.   ``I love my motherland dearly, I love it more than I love my ownlife,'' he added, weeping openly.   Several thousand people lined Santiago's main boulevard to seePinochet ride in an open limousine for eight blocks from thepresidential palace to a government building to deliver his speechin front of 3,000 government officials, military officers, diplomatsand special guests.   Pinochet is to hand over the government on March 11 to asuccessor to be elected in balloting set for Dec. 14.   Pinochet called the election after an October 1988 referendum inwhich voters rejected a military proposal to prolong his rule until1997.   Patricio Awlyin, 70, a former Senate president supported by acoalition of 17 opposition parties, is favored to win the election.   But Pinochet will retain a substantial amount of power. Theconstitution, written by his administration, allows him to remain asarmy commander until 1998 and he has said he intends to do so.   He made clear the military will keep a close eye on the newgovernment.   He said the armed forces ``will not allow that our nationalidentity be deformed again and our sovereignty be subject to alienideologies.''   Speaking of the coup, he said, ``If we hadn't taken power, Chilewould have suffered the tragic consequences of a civilian war,encouraged by the (Allende) government itself.'' And since the coup,he said, ``I have faced the biggest enemy of humanity _ LeninistMarxism.''   He announced a 12 percent salary increase for all governmentemployees effective Dec. 1 and said they will receive a $20 bonusthis month on Chilean national day.</TEXT></DOC>
