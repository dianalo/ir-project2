 Andonce again it differed substantially from the IFRA show held only a few weeksbefore.andP;  As the last big event of the decade, it demonstrated that the UKcontinues to have one of the most interesting newspaper markets.andM;In addition to this, Newstec '89 had a unique importance to the UK.andP;  Thisindustry has been going to Brighton every other year for thisconference/exhibition, despite the presence of IFRA only weeks before.andO;Ironically, this show has flourished in spite of the poor exhibitionconditions with limited access, poor power supplies, multiple cramped exhibitareas, and lack of space for expansion of the exhibition.andP;  But still it hasalways been a popular event among attenders and exhibitors.andM;One reason for this popularity is the atmosphere.andP;  Brighton offers its manyhotels, bars and restaurants in a small area, making this the show that neverstops.andP;  Its social activities facilitate the making of deals--always anintrinsic part of Newstec.andP;  After arriving back in the hotel after midnightfollowing an evening of business (or partying), one often finds the bar aconvenient place to get involved in further discussions with both newspaperstaff and vendors.andM;An era ends.andP;  In 1991, Newstec will leave Brighton to go to the commodiousconference and exhibition location of the National Exhibition Centre atBirmingham, where the massive IPEX show is held every four years.andP;  However,it would be accurate to say that not one exhibitor we have spoken to wants tomove to Birmingham, and the same goes for the staffs of newspapers.andP;  In fact,since the announcement of the move, there has been constant discussion andpressure exerted focusing on trying to change that decision.andP;  Among theproposals has been one for us at Seybold to set up and run a newspaperconference and exhibition in Brighton at the same time Newstec traditionallyhas fallen.andM;To an extent, this pressure has worked.andP;  The Newspaper Society, which is theorganization of regional UK newspaper publishers that run the conference andexhibition, has backed down somewhat from its earlier plan.andP;  Initially, ithad planned to make Newstec an annual event.andP;  But at Newstec '89 it announceda new plan in which Newstec will stay biennial, to be held next in March1991.andP;  In addition, starting in March 1992, there will be a single technologyseminar held in Brighton.andM;It was claimed that the reasons for this change were that the NewspaperSociety had concluded that the time was not yet right for a move to an annualNewstec event because the market is becoming saturated with exhibitions.andP;  Wewon't argue with that conclusion.andP;  But we believe that the principal reasonfor the change was the almost universal threat of a boycott of the plannedNewstec '92 by the industry's vendors.andM;Nevertheless, the industry is still unhappy about the move to Birmingham, andthere is a general belief that Newstec in 1993 will move away from Birminghamto a location either in Brighton or to a similar resort town.andM;The '89 show.andP;  Apart from that, Newstec in 1989 showed some of what had beenseen at IFRA a few weeks before, particularly in the cases of majorinternational vendors, many of which had nothing different to show.andP;  Butthere were many vendors at Newstec that hadn't appeared at IFRA.andP;  Thesecompanies showed an interesting range of developments.andM;A few companies that had been at IFRA saved their major showings for the UKexhibition, and they will be covered here.andP;  Among these companies was Quark,which produced one of the major successes of Newstec, although it didn't evenhave its own stand.andP;  Quark's success was demonstrated by five exhibitors whoare building their pagination approaches around Quark Xpress using QuarkXtensions.andP;  Companies in this mold include Press Computer Systems and QED,which have developed impressive links into Quark.andP;  We also saw Typetronics,Miles 33 (the former Pagitek operation), and Apple Centre Waterloo showinglinks via Xtensions into Xpress for pagination.andM;It had appeared earlier in 1989 that the UK's newspaper bubble had burst, andthe market had gone quiet.andP;  While we may no longer be seeing new newspaperlaunches happening at the speed they were in 1988, Newstec showed that thereare many buyers about.andP;  A number of stands were busy throughout the time ofthe show.andP;  These were predominantly the vendors of fourth-wave systems, withMiles 33, GB Techniques and Talbot appearing to be busiest.andP;  However, oneother stand that was constantly busy was PCS, which demonstrated majordevelopments in the functionality of its PCs as terminals, plus links intothe Macintosh world.andM;As usual, a few orders were placed on stands, the biggest of which was amajor classified system ordered from ND Comtec by Scottish and UniversalNewspapers.andM;All in all, Newstec at Brighton went out with a bang, and the most eventfuldecade this century for the UK newspaper industry went out with a flourish.andM;Our coverage.andP;  As usual, we will focus on the new developments that haven'tbeen reported before.andP;  But we don't mean to imply that some of the majorvendors didn't exhibit.andP;  The following companies were there, but most oftheir products had been demonstrated at IFRA, where we covered them indetail: Autologic, Crosfield, Dansk Data Electronic, ECRM, Hyphen,Information International, Linotype, Monotype, Scitex, System Integrators,Sinclair and Talbot.andM;Agfa CG launches ad systemandM;Compugraphic UK, a consistent and long-standing supporter of the newspaperindustry (unlike some other Compugraphic companies around the world) iscontinuing its commitment.andP;  It was the only country apart from the U.S.andP;  tosell the old One System line, and following its demise in the U.S., the UKsoftware team totally redeveloped this product and sold it as theCompugraphic Newspaper System.andM;At IPEX last year, Compugraphic UK introduced an editorial system basedtotally on PCs running on a Novell network.andP;  Called the Editorial PC Network,it bore some resemblance to the U.S.-developed Intrepid system, ut much ofthe software came from the UK Development team.andM;At Newstec, CG UK introduced a totally new, all-UK-developed AdvertisingNewspaper Network.andP;  Like other products before, the Compugraphic networks arebuilt around Olivetti PC hardware.andP;  They use either 80386 or 80286 fileservers running with Novell Netware software on an Ethernet topology, and theterminals are either 8086 or 80286 PCs.andP;  The standard monitor supports VGAcolor, but a lower-cost monochrome option is also offered.andM;So far this sounds like many other systems in the mmarket.andP;  Where it differsis that it uses a relational database system on the file server, based on theRBase relational database.andP;  The terminal sports a very comprehensiveuser-programmable screen structure linked to a user-modifiable script tocontrol the sequence of operations.andP;  This script is used to govern the flowof operations while ads are taken so one form can automatically call anotherone.andP;  The script is also used to link the screen form to the respective fieldin the database.andP;  This means that the database can be changed to add fields,or to modify the form layout without having to consider its effect on otherparts of the system or on other forms.andM;It also means that different forms layouts can be used by operators on thesystem--for example, one for novices and a different one for experienced adtakers.andP;  The system was designed to limit the amount of information on screenat any one time to avoid cluttering the screen.andP;  Because one field calls thenext field to the screen, this approach works well.andM;The system makes excellent use of color in showing where different types ofdata are available.andP;  A specific color can be used to show that there is alookup table behind the entry window that can be used as an aid.andP;  An exampleof this is that a classification help behind the classification screen can beaccessed with a single key to bring up the list of all classifications.andP;  Helpis available for each field that comes up automatically, but this facilitycan be switched on or off on an individual field basis.andP;  This again isparticularly useful during training, but it is something an experiencedoperator wouldn't want.andM;The system has a wide range of powerful functions, although as yet it isstill not completed.andP;  It can handle a very comprehensive range of insertionpatterns, by code, calendar or both.andP;  It is possible to find out the statusof an ad by pointing to the insertion calendar entry.andP;  This gives the fullinformation about that insertion.andM;Still lacking are a few facilities available in one or two of the bettersystems, such as the ability to make one entry to sell an ad to cover twoseparate column measures, and the ability to obtain automatically both anup-selling and down-selling quote at the same time as the requested quote.andO;these items are being worked upon, however.andM;One of the benefits of using an off-the-shelf database and a form systembased on user-definable scripts is that it is possible to produce a widerange of reports very easily and to customize the system to fit easily auser's requirements.andP;  The effect on performance we cannot state; we didn'tsee a large, heavily loaded system.andP;  The speed of response we were getting inthe demonstration, however, was very fast.andM;So far the system has only been under development for seven months by a teamof two.andP;  Initial shipments are expected in the second quarter of 1990.andM;What CG has produced is one of the most flexible PC ad booking systems wehave yet seen.andP;  If Compugraphic in the U.S.andP;  is serious about getting backinto the newspaper market as a system supplier, it should take a very closelook at the developments from its UK company.andP;  The editorial system is betterthan Intrepid ever was in the U.S., and the new advertising system is in atotally different league.andM;Apple dealer shows DataPageandM;Apple Centre Waterloo, a large Apple dealer that has taken a special interestin the media markets, has the UK distribution rights for the productsdeveloped by The Electronic Publisher (now called the Synaptic ElectronicPublisher).andP;  At Newstec it demonstrated the Electronic Publisher's DataPagesystem that was shown a few times earlier in the year and has recently beguninitial shipments.andM;As we reported before, this is a Fourth Dimension page planning system thatlinks via Xtensions into Quark Xpress.andP;  Since last June, the product hasadvanced substantially and now provides a high level of functions.andO;Functioning as a page planning and management system, it enables a page to beplanned as an electronic dummy and the page elements to be stored in a FourthDimension database with their associated style commands.andM;This information is then accessed by a text editing program that enableswriting copy that also is stored in the database.andP;  Datapage thenautomatically loads the respective elements of the page into Xpress via anXtension to enable the entire page to be made up.andP;  Datapage can also be usedto check the status of page elements that have been defined.andM;Atex reminiscesandM;Atex Ltd. didn't show any new products that weren't at IFRA, but it made itsmark anyway.andP;  It used its role as the leading supplier in the prepressnewspaper industry to host an on-stand party for the UK newspaper industryand all of Atex's competitors on the last afternoon.andP;  The idea was tocommemorate the end of the last real Newstec.andP;  For the occasion, Atexprovided a band and plenty of drink to look back on what has been mostsuppliers' favorite show, as well as to provide an open house for itscompetitors to meet.andP;  Unfortunately, the trusty Seybold scribe was stillfinishing his coverage so had to forego the pleasures of this unique event.andM;John Blishen: paper and still videoandM;John Blishen, the traditional supplier of consumables for thephototypesetting market, more recently has become known for introducing aspecial paper for producing camera-ready copy directly from laser printers.andO;This paper has rapidly become the market leader in the UK, and it is beingused by many newspapers.andM;At Newstec, Blishen showed the Canon still-video system, for which it hasbeen appointed as the sole UK distributor for the newspaper industry.andP;  Italso demonstrated the same Canon system that has been seen in the U.S., butit was using the UK-developed Neotech Image Grabber video capture board forthe Macintosh.andP;  (ND Comtec also showed a similar Canon still-videoconfiguration.)andM;Chemco Europe shows EpimasandM;We got a chance to catch up on a product we had missed at IFRA: ChemcoEurope's Epimas system.andP;  This system is designed for the remote input andmanagement of images from local editorial offices that communicate with acentral site.andP;  It is built around fast '386 PCs with separate, high-qualitycolor screns to view images.andP;  The control screen, operating within theMicrosoft Windows environment, is easy to use.andP;  Image scanners supportedinclude the Nikon color scanner and the Agfa S800 and the Chemco S-300monochrome units.andP;  The system also can be linked to the Teragon scanner soldby Chemco Europe.andM;The Epimas system handles data compression and transmission, or transfer to aproduction system.andP;  Communication uses ISDN 64 KBit operation.andP;  At thereception site the system will handle receipt of files, decompression,viewing of images, the ability to add or modify image captions, proofing oroutputting images, or transfer to a production system.andP;  The system is statedto give compression of up to 8 times.andP;  One can also add an Epimas videomodule to any workstation to enable still-video images to be input.andM;Another item we failed to see at IFRA was a development of the Teragonsystem.andP;  There is now a lower level system for monochrome only, the CT 2000,which is 40% lower in cost than the TS 4000 system.andP;  It can be upgraded tofull color specification in the field.andP;  The Teragon color scanner, the 6425C,which we saw earlier this year at the French Grafitec exhibition, has nowgone into beta test at the French news magazine L'Express, who up to now hasbeen using a Hasselblad color scanner as input to the Teragon system.andM;Cybervision targets quick printersandM;Cybervision is a small, new company that is one of many off-shoots of the oldXenotron organization.andP;  Headed by Iain Houghton, the Xenotron co-founder andtechnical director, it is staffed by two other ex-Xenotron members, SteveRobinson and Sean Moran.andM;We commented on the company at ANPA, where it exhibited its ad makeup producton the GB Techniques stand, since it is sold by GB as its Advance terminal.andO;The product is now ready for shipment and has been integrated into GB'ssystem.andP;  (See GB Techniques.)andM;Software enhancements since ANPA include the ability to stretch an overalladvertisement by pulling the box area to fill the required space, with allelements increasing in size proportionately.andP;  This is in addition to verticaljustification using Cybervision's equivalent of Xenotron's Super Cursor thatwe had seen before.andM;Another new feature is the ability to set text around an irregular-shapedobject, which is carried out in a similar fashion to Aldus PageMaker, wherethe shape is created using polylines on screen.andM;QuickPrint 2000.andP;  Cybervision appeared separately from GB because it hasretained the rights to sell the product directly to customers.andP;  To this end,it launched a product it calls QuickPrint 2000, which is targeted at smallcommercial printers and typesetters for carrying out a wide range ofcommercial typesetting functions.andP;  This appears to be the lowest-cost totaltext and graphics system we have seen, and Cybervision is looking fordistributors for the product.andM;The system comprises the ad makeup terminal (Ad 2000), plus a 300-dpi scannerwith support software (Art 2000 and Scan 2000), with a 72-pica Ultre imagingengine (Micro-Setter 1) driven via a PostScript software RIP.andP;  The basesystem running on a single PC sells for 16,000 pound sterling ($25,000).andP;  Thesystem can be run on a network with multiple PCs using the Invisible Net 30networking software (a Netware look-alike).andM;The system structure is different from most PostScript systems in that thesoftware RIP pre-processes elements of a pag and wirtes them to disk as abitmap at the required resolution.andP;  As the various elements are pre-RIP'ed,they are written to disk until the entire page is created, at which timerecording begins.andP;  This should speed up the total output time in comparisonto systems that wait until the whole page is completed and then RIP'ing itall at that time.andM;Cybervision is working on a database layer for managing the overallproduction cycle.andP;  It claims this will work in much the same way asXenotron's DEC Vax-based database did for handling work in a Xenotron system.andM;DDE: everything but the kitchen sinkandM;Direct Data Entry is a very small company whose specialization has beenportable editing terminals, but it also provides a very low-cost simpleeditorial system that is often used to feed larger systems.andP;  The system isbased on DDE's Basket software run on a variety of hardware configurations,such as Tandy 200s as input keyboards, PCs for subbing copy (that's copyediting in American parlance) and Macintoshes for formatting, compsoition andpagination.andP;  Version 7 of this software is for serial netowrks, whereasversion 9 is for Ethernet.andM;DDE also sells a number of software packages to simplify connection into androuting round systems.andP;  Tehse products include:andM;* Phone, which simplifies (by a series of questions) routing by establishingcatchline, publication and queue status.andP;  Phone builds the story header fromthis and routes copy into the system.andM;* Headfit, a simple routine based upon character widths from the productionsystem.andM;* Castoff, which reads any file and gives an estimate of the relevantsingle-column depth.andM;* Cleansweep, a basket-emptying routine based upon dates.andM;* Poll, an automatic communication system for sending the same copy to anumber of different locations.andP;  The software controlls all the dialing,logging on and off and communicating the data.andM;* Host, a PC-based communication system that allows unattended operationpermitting remote input from external sites into a central system.andP;  Copy iswritten to disk as it is coming in.andP;  Once the communication is finished, thedata is automatically sent to the editorial system.andM;Word Mover.andP;  The other main item introduced at Newstec was a word processingprogram called Word Mover, developed by Computerease (Warren, Rhode Island)and demonstrated in various versions at recent ANPA shows.andP;  It is afull-featured word processor with integrated document tracking andcommunications.andP;  DDE will offer this as the text editing element of itssystem, linked with Basket software and using the other software moduleshighlighted above.andM;Word Mover's screen display is similar to that of Atex or XyWrite products.andO;We were told that it is being used by the Boston Globe.andP;  We recently receiveda review copy of it and hope to get a chance to test it soon.andM;DPS Typecraft adds to Image BuilderandM;DPS Typecraft, a system developer as well as UK distributor of DigitalTechnology and Mycro-Tek products, focused on the Image Builder monochromescanning system sold in the U.S.andP;  by DTI.andP;  Also demonstrated was theMasterPlanner ad dummying product from DPS's Agefame subsidiary, which issold in the U.S.andP;  by Mycro-Tek.andM;Image Builder, which uses either video or CCD scanning technology, is beingenhanced in the area of image management.andP;  The target is to have a full imagemanagement database, certain elements of which were shown at Newstec.andP;  Theseincluded the ability to select images, look at their source and find out howlong they have been resident in the system.andP;  There was also a new &quot;picturetasting&quot; facility that enables an operator to view a screenful of images in asmall size to pick the one or more that may be needed (much the way a &quot;copytaster&quot; selects stories).andM;Picture tasting can be run concurrently with other applications, enabling theoperator to browse through images while working on page makeup.andM;We also saw the first elements of Image Builder handling color in conjunctionwith the Truvel color scanner.andM;DPS Typecraft also showed an interesting unit put together with theassistance of Apple.andP;  Called the RackMac, it is designed to be DPS's fileserver.andP;  It uses a Mac II motherboard, but adds a Cyclone 33-MHz acceleratorcard to boost performance.andP;  It has high-speed, large-format, dual mirroreddisks and uninterruptable power supplies.andM;GBT active on all frontsandM;Although GB Techniques exhibited at IFRA, it kept its new developments forNewstec, which served as the venue for a major introduction: the Mentor 90system.andP;  The display included a new text editor for the editorial system; aradically improved classified system, also with a totally new text editor;close, relatively seamless integration of Information Engineering's PC NewsLayout editorial page layout product and also Newpaper Software's Planner3000 ad dummy system; and a 600-dpi plain-paper recorder developed inassociation with its parent company, Monotype.andM;Editorial system.andP;  The editor for the editorial system is an example of thecooperation among various Monotype companies; it was developed by GraphicSystems in France, where it is in use with the system.andP;  We commented on theexcellence of this editor in our coverage of the GEC exhibition in Milan inMay 1987.andM;The new GB version of the codeless editor, Compositor, is built around a verypowerful format capability supporting up to 9,999 formats per file, as wellas a range of single-key define-and-operate functions.andP;  It also has apowerful editing and composition language accommodating 200 user variablesplus a full range of system variables.andM;This means that a user can build very sophisticated functions into a format,including conditional statements as well as calculations.andP;  It is possible totest formats within a format, such as in testing for the position and size ofa dropped capital letter.andP;  Formats also can be linked.andM;The system is very tightly linked with GB's terminal preview mode so formatscan be tested easily while they are being developed; they can be put in usequickly to judge their effect in editing mode.andP;  This is particularly usefulin carrying out area composition.andP;  GB will supply Compositor with a range ofpre-written formats to get a user operational as quickly as possible.andO;Another plus is that Compositor can be run with up to five differenthyphenation languages at the same time.andP;  On the minus side, it currentlylacks a thesaurus.andM;We would say Compositor appears to be somewhat more powerful than the Atexcomposition language, and compares to System Integrattor's Style facility.andO;With its close link to the composition program and the preview, it shouldenhance GB's position in the marketplace for those Atex and SII customers whomay be looking for a PC system, but wish to retain the power of their currenteditors.andM;Classified.andP;  The classified ad system is an enhancement of the product thathas now been available for a about year.andP;  One new feature is a user-definablescreen layout supporting up to four concurrent entry windows of any shape andsize, plus two read-back windows.andP;  In any window, the user can specifydisplay of any fields from the database.andP;  This currently is GB's owndatabase, although early in 1990 it will switch to Novell's Btrieve storagesystem.andM;One of the major weaknesses of GB's earlier classified system was that itused the interactive composition module that had been ported from the earlierproduction system.andP;  This meant that an operator wanting to handle any simplelayout needed a good understanding of the composition system.andM;The ssytem has been given a new format-driven editor, but not he same one asappears in the editorial system.andP;  This editor is very Atex-like, having beenacquired from a GB customer who is also a large Atex user.andP;  It uses colors todisplay different format breaks.andP;  It also is linked closely with thecomposition position and preview mode in the terminal, so an ad taker canquickly see the effect of using a particular format.andM;One facility we have not found on other systems is the use of either 25 or 43lines of text on the screen.andP;  The 43-line mode uses a smaller type size.andP;  Itis possible to switch modes in the middle of an advertisement and see theeffect immediately.andP;  The 43-line mode is useful not only in showing all ofthe text of longer ads at the same time, but also in handling longer entrieson the booking form.andM;The GB advertising system has proved to be somewhat slow in writing advertsto the file server and in giving back to the user the control of the screen.andO;To get over this, GB introduced a queue server where all ads are written to aPC or PCs, and control is immediately returned to the ad taker to sell thenext ad.andP;  The queue server then writes the ad to the database.andP;  Not only doesthis increase speed and data security, but it also allows for immediategeneration of reports without putting extra load on the system.andM;A single queue server allows one ad to be stored every fifteen seconds, thusallowing 240 ads per hour to be stored per queue server.andP;  Multiple queueservers can be configured on a system.andM;A new report-generation facility was introduced using Microsoft Excel toallow customizable reports to be produced in graphical or alphanumeric form.andO;Because it is built around Excel, customers can not only generate their ownreports, but also can use the spreadsheet facilities for substantial dataassessment.andM;Display ads.andP;  Linked to the system can be GB's Advance display ad system.andO;Developed by Cybervision in the UK, this is now closely linked to the GB adsystem.andP;  Advance can access the GB ad database to read information coveringspace booked, insertions and text copy.andP;  The ad can then be made up andstored in the system.andP;  If changes are subsequently made to the text of an ad,these can be entered from the normal GB ad booking terminal.andM;GB also will offer the Serif ad makeup terminal built around MicrosoftWindows.andP;  It sees this as being appropriate for customers who like aMacintosh-like user interface, or a more graphical presentation.andP;  The Serifsystem currently isn't as closely integrated into the GB system as is theAdvanced terminal.andM;News Layout.andP;  The integration of the Information Engineering PC News Layoutsystem is now complete.andP;  The first system is in operation at Bradford, whereit is linked to a large GB editorial system and two subeditors are making upthe whole editorial content of the newspaper each day.andP;  This is similar tothe manner in which PC News Layout is interfaced to Atex systems, where asubeditor fits the copy to the space allocated by the system.andP;  (GB, which hasexclusive rights to sell the Information Engineering product in the UK, hasalso made a sale to a large Atex site in Fleet Street.)andM;Integration of the Newspaper Software Planner 3000 ad dummy system is alsonicely done.andP;  It is linked to the ad booking database as well as to the PCNews Layout system to transfer the placement of all display ads into theeditorial pages.andP;  The integration of all of these products is as good as anywe have seen.andM;GB currently lacks a classified pagination system, but is developing thisinhouse.andM;Plain-paper output.andP;  The final new item was a 600-dpi plain-paper outputdevice of A3 (11&quot; x 17&quot;) format.andP;  This uses the Hitachi engine we first sawdemonstrated by Xitron at the Seybold Computer Publishing Conference.andP;  It isa true 600-dpi unit with a spot size of 60 microns (2.5 mills).andP;  It producesquite reasonable quality.andP;  The standard unit comes with two A3-sized papertrays.andM;Unlike the unit Xitron was showing, which used a Chelgraph RIP running thestandard Ace and other typesetter emulation software, the GB machine isdriven by a PC with a RIP featuring Weitek hardware and software.andP;  It runs ina '286 PC with a single PC bus card RIP.andP;  The RIP uses the Weitek XL 8236 and8237 RISC processors with 12 MB of RAM.andP;  It runs Weitek's PostScriptinterpreter software and also will offer various typesetter emulations.andP;  Theuse of a PC enables easy interfacing to the GB network, and it will permitspooling of data to the disk.andM;The unit is currently going through production engineering.andP;  First deliveriesare scheduled for late in the first quarter of 1990.andM;Hell Zenotron shows BridgltandM;Hell Xenotron's AdOne display ad makeup workstation was making its firstappearance at a UK show.andP;  We covered this product at IFRA so no more needs tobe said at this stage.andM;At IFRA Hell also showed the new PC BridgIt imagesetter, but at that timedetails about the product were unavailable.andP;  It uses Ultre's 72-pica imagingunit and an AT with a RISC RIP card.andP;  It comes with 35 Bitstream fonts (theLaserwriter Plus set) and can use both Type 1 and Type 3 PostScript fonts.andO;The first sale of this product was to the largest Danish daily newspapergroup, Dagbladet Politiken, where it will be used with three AdOne display adsystems and a ScriptMaster PostScript converter.andP;  Initially the output fromthe AdOne units will be to the PC BridgIt, but later the ScriptMaster will beused to convert PostScript data for output on the company's two Digiset LS210imagesetters.andM;Horsell gets into handamp;j marketandM;Horsell Graphic Industries, one of the world's leading suppliers of printingplates, entered the digital prepress industry last year when it acquiredWordSet Systems.andP;  At Newstec, it demonstrated an expansion of its focus intosome new areas.andP;  It has joined th list of OEM suppliers of compositionmodules in a similar fashion to Deucalion Resources Group and Stonehand inthe U.S.andP;  The Horsell product came in a deal for Northcliffe Newspapers' handamp;jsoftware module, plus a modified version of Northcliffe's Text-Flow editor toincorporate in a new classified ad system being developed for the StokeSentinel newspaper operation.andP;  Horsell also will be developing a new previewmode to go with Text-Flow.andM;Horsell also introduced a new version of its Solus commercial compositionsystem that runs on a 68000/68020 processor.andP;  Output is in PostScript or Coralanguage.andP;  The system provides excellent composition quality with full usercontrol over kerning, tracking and text runarounds.andP;  The system is sold intwo configurations.andP;  With a 12&quot; monitor outputting only PostScript, butincluding a 300-dpi laser pritner, the price is 6,000 pounds sterling($9,600).andP;  With a larger monitor and the addition of typesetter drivers, itsells for 8,000 pounds sterling ($12,800).andP;  This can be networked withHorsell's PC-based Text-Flow system.andM;Interset moves into newspapersandM;Interset, best known as a leading European supplier of commercial systems,has moved into the newspaper market.andP;  Having started with softwarepredominantly for book setting, it went on to develop page makeup terminalsand graphic systems, which it sells as interlinked modules.andP;  The newspapermarket offering, introduced at Newstec, builds on the structure of theexisting Studio Master page makeup and Graphics Master integratedtext-and-graphics pagination systems.andM;Interset has linked these with networked PCs running editorial, classified adand business software to make a total newspaper system called Tops.andP;  Thefirst installation is at the Newbury (UK) Weekly News.andP;  The system comprisesa Studio Master pagination system with seven ViewText pagination terminals.andO;Five of these terminals are used by subeditors to assemble pages.andP;  The othertwo are used for display ad makeup.andP;  There is also a Graphics Master with alinked ECRM Autokon image scanner, which is linked via Ethernet with theStudio Master.andP;  Output is to either a Linotron 202 or a Monotype Express S2.andM;Linked to the pagination system is the editorial and classified advertisingnetwork, which is built around Novell Netware with dual file servers for thetwo applications.andP;  At Newbury there are 20 PCs in the editorial system and 15PCs for calssified.andP;  There are also nine PCs in the business system, which islinked into the classified ad database.andM;Operation.andP;  The editorial terminals are used by journalists and subeditorswho work with formats, but not with handamp;j, producing algorithmic depthestimates based on true font widths.andP;  After a story has been subbed on theeditorial PC, it is transferred into the Studio Master to which the editorialnetwork is bridged.andP;  This can be directed (by use of special characters inthe story header) to go into specified page or section directories on theStudio Master.andP;  The transfer is one way only; data can't be sent back fromthe Studio MAster into any specified directory in the editorial system.andM;Once the data is in the Studio Master, subeditors on Viewtext terminalsassemble pages.andP;  However, Viewtext is more of a production than an editorialtool for page makeup, so it may be more appropriate to see this as aproduction-oriented back-end pagination solution.andM;The classified ad system is predominantly designed for the smaler regionalnewspapers where there isn't a great demand for sophisticated cross-sellingbetween publications.andP;  Most of the booking functions can be handled either bywindow selections or by codes.andP;  Although it is a comprehensive bookingsystem, it lacks the functionality of a preview mode, such as is available onthe PC classified systems sold in the UK by Compugraphic, GBT, Miles 33 andInformational International.andM;There is no composition in the terminal, so ads are sold by an algorithmicdepth assessment rather than by true depth.andP;  Interset claims that theestimate is accurate, but we haven't been able to verify this.andM;For output, the selected ad data is passed through the editorial system intothe Studio Master where it is composed and made up into pages.andM;IPL looking for a buyerandM;Unfortunately, IPL Image Printing Ltd. failed to make it to the show with itsplain-paper proofers and typesetters.andP;  The week prior to the show, its parentcompany called in an outstanding loan that IPL was unable to repay.andP;  It hasthus gone into receivership (the equivalent of Chapter 11 in the U.S.), andis actively looking for a buyer for the company.andP;  We wish it well.andM;Miles 33 adds to PENS, version 2andM;Most of Miles 33's newspaper developments were shown at IFRA, including thePENS editorial and Space classified systems, which use as output the Studiopage layout system running on a '386 PC.andP;  This layout system, which is mainlya commercial product, is purely a back-end solution.andM;At Newsttec, Miles demonstrated further developments of PENS in release 2,which enables sorting articles by size and by date stamp.andP;  This enhancementmakes it possible not only to sort stories by age, but it also permitsgenerating an audit trail to show the path an article has been through sinceit was written.andM;A few other enhancements were shown also, including spelling checking in UKand U.S.andP;  English, as well as most European languages.andP;  The quality of thepreview mode has been improved through the use of Bitstream fonts on theStudio system.andP;  Double-page spreads can be accomodated, as can on-screen textrotation.andP;  Automatic copyfitting to depth is supported, with space addedbetween headings, paragraphs and between text lines (feathering).andP;  There isalso now an interface to a video graphics system.andM;Orders.andP;  Miles announced some major orders, including the biggest PC-basedclassified system in the UK--and possibly the world: a 750,000 poundssterling ($1.2 million), 72-terminal order from Bradford Telegraph and Argusfor a Space classified system.andP;  This will have two principal locations joinedvia a high-speed communications link.andM;Another large order for a Space system was placed by West Briton, aNorthcliffe newspaper in Cornwall, which will use it with a Kilostream linkedwide-area network between Truro, Penzance and Bodmin.andM;P  Page makeup with Quark, Newspaper Software.andP;  At Newstec Miles showed itsfirst impelementation of Quark Xpress using Xtensions to handle editorialpage makeup.andP;  It makes use of the CopyFlow Xtension from North AmericanPublishing Systems (see the Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing, Vol.andP;  4,No.andP;  3, page 52).andM;CopyFlow provides facilities for transferring Quark commands and informationabout story and image areas as geometry into the PENS system, from where itis exported as text files into a Quark page.andM;The system is still under development, and as yet PENS is fully utilizing thegeometry to enable writing to fit to be carried out.andM;Miles also is using Newspaper Software Planner 3000 for preparing ad dummies.andO;This also isn't as yet fully integrated into the system, either to the Spacead database or into pagination to reserve areas on pages for ROP ads.andP;  Theability to link all these elements is planned and development is under way.andM;ND Comtec getting back on trackandM;In recent times, Newstec seems to have marked a time of transition for NDComtec's UK operation.andP;  At the last show in 1987, it was going through aphase of major expansion in the UK--resulting in much success.andP;  Shortly afterthat time, the parent company, Norsk Data, began a period of financialstrain.andP;  Concurrent with the parental problems, the UK company experiencedsome difficulties with earlier installations, primarily centering onperformance issues.andP;  IT also has faced serious defections of its UKmanagement, with four senior managers leaving in 1988 to join Dansk DataElectronics and set up its UK Euromax division.andM;The move to full, 32-bit minicomputer architecture appears to have eradicatedthe performance problems, but the management issue reared its head again acouple of months ago when the managing director and sales director of NDComtec in the UK left in a conflict of over future planning.andP;  Because ofthese problems, there have been doubts as to the viability of the UKoperation.andM;What has ND done to answer these criticisms?andP;  It came out swinging at Newstecwith announcements of two major orders.andP;  The first of these, valued at morethan 1 million pounds sterling ($1.6 million), was placed by Scottish andUniversal Newspapers for an integrated advertising and accounting system fora number of its regional publishing offices.andM;The system will provide full telecommunications capabilities to operate froma new central computing resource in Stirling, Scotland.andP;  This center willhave seven ND A30 tpServers linked via a TCP/IP Ethernet network.andP;  Eachserver will have its own 310-MB system disk.andP;  Three of the servers (A30L),acting as the system database managers, will be linked to a centralduplicated file store.andP;  Each of the two file stores will have 1.2 GB ofmirrored disks (a total storage of 4.8 GB) for full fault-tolerant operation.andO;The remaining four A30C tpServers control the communications network viaKilostream (64 kilobaud) links to remote offices.andM;All terminals for the systems will be in these remote publishing centers.andO;Around 150 terminals, both PCs and Tandberg units, will be connected to thesystem.andP;  The communications network was designed by S and UN, which alsoserves as Miles 33's largest customer for the PENS editorial system.andP;  It hasPENS systems operational in most of its centers.andM;The other order received by ND Comtec was a major upgrade for SeftonNewspapers.andM;Reorganization.andP;  We also had the opportunity to talk to top Norsk Data and NDComtec management from Norway about the ongoing situation within the company.andM;We were told that from the start of 1990 a number of ND's division willbecome companies in their own right, wholly owned by Norsk Data.andP;  One ofthese will be ND Comtec.andP;  Another will be the manufacturing operation forNorsk Data computers, which will be called Dolphin.andP;  Each company will beresponsible for its bottom line and will be entitled to buy its products fromwherever it can get the best deal.andM;Norsk Data as a company is rapidly moving to full support of Unix as itsprincipal operating system, rather than using its own Sintran, and mostapplications will be running on a Unix platform during 1990.andP;  Dolphin willnot only manufacture products, based upon the current ND 32-bit minicomputerdesign, but also will buy the products it needs from around the world.andP;  Itcurrently buys all its terminals, both PCS and Tandberg units, and this willincrease as it adds 80486-based servers to the product line.andM;Norsk Data will move more into being a system integrator than being acomputer manufacturer.andP;  We will be in Norway in February 1990, and plan tospend a day with Norsk Data and ND Comtec to look at this new structure.andM;Newspaper Software adds functionsandM;Since we last looked at Newspaper Software, it has made major enhancements toits products--the Planner 3000 ad dummy system, the Diary 3000 ROP bookingproduct, and the ARC sales history database.andP;  It also has sold the Planner3000 software for integration into the GB Techniques and Miles 33 ad systems.andM;The systems are now much faster than before, partly the result of beingrewritten in C and machine code.andP;  As part of this change, they now supportmouse operation.andP;  The recommended configuration for the system is a '386 PCwith an EGA or VGA card.andM;By way of review, Planner 3000 allows for automatic and interactive planningof ROP and classified advertising.andP;  It supports views of 1, 2, 10 or 32 pagesat a time and will allow for multiple edition and multiple paper formatplanning.andP;  Its latest version has nice facilities for working with multiplepages.andP;  For example, in the ten-page view, the page being worked on appearsin enlarged format in the center of the screen with the four previous and thefive following pages around it.andP;  If elements on the central page are moved,the surrounding pages are automatically updated.andM;Planner has a very extensive range of functions and can be integrated withDiary 3000.andP;  It also can be integrated with Adlink, which is a routine forlinking Planner 3000 with third-party ad-booking systems and for sending datato page layout systems.andM;The Diary system provides a wide variety of functions for booking ROP ads.andO;It offers a wide range of management reports to provide full information onthe status of advertising at any specified time.andP;  Diary can be linkeddirectly to any suitable accounting software to handle ad accounting.andM;ARC, the sales history database, can be linked with Diary.andP;  It enablesanalysis of client information, handles sales canvassing, and provides toolsfor a full analysis of sales performance by month, period or year.andM;These products can all be networked, so they can be used to provide a fulldisplay ad system for selling, planning and reporting.andP;  They also can belinked to page layout systems for output.andM;Nikon gets into UK still videoandM;Making its first appearance at a UK publishing exhibition, Nikon demonstratedits monochrome still-video system.andP;  This is the same system as had been shownat ANPA, so we won't repeat that coverage.andP;  However, we will note that,together with the demonstration of the Canon system by John Blishen and theuse of still video as input on a number of other stands, Nikon providedevidence that there is a substantial degree of interest in this subject amongUK newspapers.andM;PCS bolsters PC, Mac functionsandM;Press Computer Systems now uses PCs as its standard terminals, rather thanTandberg units, and it supports the Macintosh for pagination and display andmakeup.andP;  One of the benefits of this move is that the handamp;j program now runs inthe terminal, freeing up the load on the PDP-11 file servers.andM;PCS also has added a full spelling-checking package in the PC, a functionthat previously had not been available.andP;  Linked with handamp;j in the PC is apreview mode called Softview.andP;  This allows the page to be zoomed for finework, with horizontal and vertical scroling around the page.andM;But the applications causing the greatest interest were the use of specialPCS software to link Macintosh applications into the PCS system.andP;  Theconnection of the Macs is currently serial, but it soon will be via Ethernet.andM;It has been possible for some time to connect the Digital Technology AdSpeedsystem into PCS, where AdSpeed can read size information and text from thePCS database.andP;  But at Newstec, PCS also showed new developments with QuarkXtensions.andP;  It has written two of its own Xtensions--AdLinker andEdLinker--and it also uses Xtensions from Software Consulting Services tolink Layout-8000 into Xpress.andM;PCS was one of the companies (also see Miles 33 above and Typetronics below)demonstrating use of North Atlantic Publishing Systems' CopyFlow to linkgeometry from Xpress into its system.andM;The EdLinker Xtension pulls editorial text from PCS into Xpress.andP;  It uses anextra menu opened within Xpress, providing full access into the PCS ediorialdatabase.andP;  It is possible also to build selective directories based uponpublication, edition and page selections.andP;  A preview facility within thisoperation provides the equivalent of a long directory.andP;  It reads in the macroformatting commands from Press 11.andP;  This interface currently works oneway--PCS to Xpress--for building pages interactively.andP;  But PCS is planning tomake it work two ways to allow for page geometry to be taken from Xpress intoPCS.andM;AdLinker works in a similar fashion but is used to enable Xpress to aid inmaking up display ads.andP;  This is a two-way interface into PCS, where fromXpress ads can be retrieved from the PCS database selectively or byclassification.andP;  The text of an ad can be brought in, or edited text can besent back for storage in the PCS system.andP;  The system also supports embeddingnotes regarding how an ad should be made up.andM;Ad booking information can also be brought across.andP;  If changes are made tothis data, the changes are stored back in the PCS ad database.andM;PCS, the UK distributor for SCS's Layout-8000 product, has interfaced this toPress 11 as well as through Quark Xtensions.andP;  For this it uses the SCS/LinxXtension to take Layout-8000 geometry for allocation of ROP space on pages.andO;PCS also uses the CopyFlow Xtension to attach names to frames created withinXpress, which are then passed back into the Press 11 system.andM;PCS has significantly changed its system over the past nine months toincorporate as much technology from the PC and Macintosh world as it an.andP;  Nowonly the PDP-11 file servers with their proprietary operating systems remainas relics of the Third Wave era.andM;Oh, yes--the Tribune system.andP;  If you are wondering how we could spend thismuch time reporting on Press Computer Systems without even mentioning itsnew-generation Tribune system, the answer is that all references to theTribune system have been dropped as PCS concentrates on selling what it hasnow.andM;But that doesn't mean the Tribune is dead.andP;  To the contrary, it is stillunder development for the Midland News Association, publisher of the Expressand Star newspapers in Wolverhampton.andP;  This is an associate company of PCS,and both are members of the Claverley Group.andM;We understand that the Tribune now being developed will be a state-of-the-artsystem running on fault-tolerant Hewlett-Packard hardware under Unix, withLAN Manager as the network system and with PC terminals running under OS/2and Presentation Manager.andM;But that describes the product being developed for this one newspaper; PCS ismaking no commitment as to whether and when it will sell this systemcommercially.andP;  We understand that it is not due to go live in Wolverhamptonuntil late in 1990.andP;  That's a far cry from what was planned earlier, but PCScertainly isn't the first company to stray from early development targets.andM;QED joins the Fifth WaveandM;QED is now a member company of Robert Maxwell's Mirror Group Newspaperssubsidiary company, Fifth Wave Technology Group, having been acquired earlierin 1989.andP;  QED will supply the editorial system for the proposed new Europeanweekly business newspaper,  The European, which is to begin publication inMay 1991.andP;  The QED system will be linked with Scitex Visionary terminals forpage layout.andP;  The system also will use Letraset's ReadySetGo and Quark XpressXtensions.andM;At Newstec, the links into Quark were being demonstrated.andP;  Of all theXtension developments shown at Newstec, QED's was probably the most advanced.andO;It provides close interaction between Xpress and the QED editiorial system.andO;Page layouts are created in Xpress and stories are assigned to specifiedframes using normal Xpress functions.andP;  It is possible to define a specificstyle for each frame and also to specify a catchline for each story.andP;  Theseare assigned to a publication, edition and page, after which they are sentinto the QED editorial system.andM;The story is opened in the editorial system, where the style is picked up andspecific areas are shown on the screen for each element of the style.andP;  Theseshow the typeface and, as text is entered, the estimated space taken up.andP;  Theestimation uses an algorithm, since there is no composition capability in theeditorial system.andM;At this stage, there is no indication of how the estimated depth compareswith the depth allocated in Xpress to advise anandM;editor if the story is short or long, and by how much.andP;   QED isandM;considering adding this capability.andM;The links between QED and Xpress can be illustrated (see photo) by a story inwhich the headline specified originally as &quot;Heart Attack&quot; is sent from theXPress system.andP;  A QED editor changes it to &quot;heart Attack Victim&quot; and sends itback.andP;  This transfer is done through a process called linking, which connectsthe layout and the text.andM;The page is automatically called up and all the completed linked elements arepulled into their respective positions on the page.andP;  These are opened up in aseparate, off-page window.andP;  The operator also sees the areas assigned tostories, where the standard Quark tools are available to perform further workon the story if required.andM;Once completed, the stories can be locked into the page and images added tothe final page (see photo on page 14).andM;Serif gets shrink-wrappedandM;We have been watching the development of the Serif display ad makeup systemsince ANPA 1988--or, really, since its first iterations at the SeyboldSeminars in March 1988.andP;  It is a Microsoft Windows system that GB Techniqueslicensed to use with its Mentor product.andP;  (GB later also licensedCybervision's ad system when it found Serif was taking too long to completeits product.)andP;  We have also been waiting to assess the program.andM;At Newstec, Serif finally showed the system in shrink-wrapped released form,which it is selling as the Adease system.andP;  It runs on a '386 PC (or a fast'286) with a minimum of 2 MB of RAM.andP;  It can be networked, but in this caseit needs the '386 Max software product to move the networking code out of the640K area.andM;Currently Adease is available under Windows 2.03.andP;  Serif is waiting to get adevelopers' version of Windows 3.0.andP;  We were told that Microsoft isn'treleasing this to any European developers at the moment.andM;We won't attempt to analyze the product now because we hope to add it soon toour series of reviews of display ad software running on off-the-shelfplatforms.andP;  It has always impressed us with its user interface, which shows athorough understanding of the needs of the display ad makeup market.andP;  As wehave mentioned previously, it uses the mouse for a &quot;bump&quot; function toincrease or decrease the type size.andP;  When an item is selected, a movement ofthe mouse in one direction bumps sizes upward, and in the other directionbumps downward.andP;  The system does not have to be operated with the mouse.andP;  Itcan also be run from the command line.andM;Adease sells for 595 pounds sterling ($950) with a PostScript driver.andP;  It isalso available with a Monotype Lasercomp driver at an additional cost.andP;  Itwill be available shortly running under OS/2 and Presentation Manager.andP;  Thereis no distribution plan in place currently, although GB Techniques will beoffering it as a part of its system.andM;Typetronics shows new systemsandM;Typetronics, set up by Chris Hall when he decided to leave his managingdirectorship at Compugraphic UK and get back into a small company, startedout refurbishing and selling old Compugraphic equipment.andP;  It also sold AppleII and Macintosh products, which came largely from Concept Publishing in theU.S.andP;  typetronics also became a major seller of desktop publishing systems.andM;Growth has been steady over the years, with the company now employing 26people, only 2 of whom are in the CG refurbishment area.andP;  In December itopened the Leeds Apple Centre.andP;  At Newstec, Typeronics introduced its owndevelopment of a Macintosh newspaper system based on the work of a small UKcompany, Consensus Software, which develops Fourth Dimension databaseapplications.andP;  Consensus's previous experience in newspapers was mainly thedevelopment of accounting and distribution packages built around 4D.andP;  It hasnow developed to Typetronics' specification the Autopage classifiedadvertising and editorial package for small newspapers.andP;  As seems to be therage these days, Autopage uses Quark Xpress and Xtensions for pagination.andM;Both classified and editorial systems are built around 4D.andM;The ad system.andP;  The ad system features the normal entry facilities such aschecking of telephone numbers and credit standing; booking ads by giving theweek number or with a calendar.andP;  It doesn't currently support payment bycredit card, but it will do so in the future.andM;A major weakness is ad retrieval for updates or kills.andP;  Currently this canonly be done by bringing all ads to the screen and selecting the desired one.andO;Ads are also priced only by word or by algorithmic depth assessment sincethere is no composition in the booking system.andM;Within the advertising system there is good reporting structure through theuse of the 4D database.andP;  This includes being able to define the layout of thereports.andM;Editorial features.andP;  An editor starts by entering story information into aform.andP;  This covers the title, pictures to be used, the section of the paperwhere the article is to appear, and the catchline.andP;  There is also a notesfile that can be attached to a story.andP;  The system, which uses Applesharerouting, follows normal routing procedures in that once a story is sent to asub, it cannot be recalled by the writer.andM;With the correct access codes, it is possible to view the access and routingstructures on the system and easily change them.andP;  It is possible also to lookat the queues to see the list of stories to be subbed.andP;  The picture referenceon the entry form will control picture requirements.andP;  It is planned toprovide a link to a graphics database to recall the images.andM;For composition and pagination, both the advertising and editorial systemswill be linked via the CopyFlow Xtension into Quark Xpress.andP;  The system isdesigned for newspapers where a maximum of 10 terminals will be required ineach department.andP;  Thus its facilities are targeted for the needs of thesesmall newspapers.andP;  The product is still under development, with initialshipments planned for early in 1990.andM;Unified Technology aims at adsandM;Unified Technology, a small UK developer, sells a PC-based composition systemtargeted at the display ad makeup market.andP;  The product, called Typecast ATF,is mainly used by commercial printers for page makeup.andP;  It has drivers forCompugraphic, Linotype (Cora), Monotype and Chelgraph (Ace) typesetters, aswell as PostScript machines.andP;  The software is sold in the U.S.andP;  as part ofthe GraphX system.andP;  At Newstec, Unified Technology also demonstrated theGraphX classified system.andM;Typecast uses its own windowing structure and is oriented toward codes ratherthan menus, much like traditional systems from Compugraphic and Varityper,rather than desktop publishing products.andP;  It supports a grid and stylesheets, automatic and manual kerning, tracking, and so on.andM;From what we saw, it appeared reasonably comprehensive in its functionality,but it lacked a number of facilities we would regard as necessary forproducing display ads.andP;  These include vertical justification, which is due inthe next release of the software, and a convenient means of creating a modelfor building repetitive parts of an ad.andM;It supports EPSF, TIFF and some paint graphics formats.andM;The system can be networked to make a multiterminal configuration.andM;The software costs 495 pounds sterling ($800) with a PostScript driver.andP;  Eachtypesetter driver is an additional 715 pounds sterling ($1,150).andM;Classified ads.andP;  The GraphX class ad booking system that Unified sells in theUK currently is being anglicized.andP;  It appeared to be a relatively simplesystem and it handles booking of lineage ads only.andP;  It cannot book space fordisplay or semidisplay ads.andM;The operator hs to define type styles when the ad is being booked.andO;Unfortuantely, although it is linked to the Typecast system, the linktransfers ASCII text only and doesn't use the Typecast styles.andP;  Ad retrievalfor updating also is limited to browsing the ad database.andM;Wisefax using TransputersandM;Wisefax Data Communication Systems supplies communications systems to the UKnewspaper market.andP;  It used to handle the Intertec system before it was boughtby Monotype.andP;  At Newstec, it introduced what appears to be thelowest-cost--and perhaps the fastest--picture wire system we have ever seen.andM;It runs on a standard PC with a VGA display and a single card in the PC busto provide the picture wire facilities.andP;  This card uses a single InmosTransputer RISC processor, as well as having IEEE 488 and SCSI interfaces andsupport for three analog wire lines and color video input.andP;  This card willcost around 5,000 pounds sterling ($8,000) and will turn a PC into a wiresystem.andP;  The addition of a video grabber card (which is alsoTransputer-based) will enable input of both monochrome and color videoimages.andM;From what we saw, this system appeared as fast as anything we have seen inretrieving images from disk, either as full size or as thumbnails.andP;  The useof a standard PC means that PCs can be networked to enable the Wisefax cardto act as both a picture receiver and file server.andM;Wisefax also has the marketing rights for a number of other communicationsproducts.andP;  These include the Sony still-video products.andM;One of the most interesting other products is the Color Photophone videotransmission system from Image Data Corporation.andP;  This unit has a590X440X8-bit color screen at the transmitting and receiving sites and acolor video camera.andP;  The camera can be used to scan prints, flat art imagesor even slides or negatives.andP;  Communication between the two systems is to V29standards.andP;  The image is defined on the transmitting system and sent to thereceiving site with a 20:1 compression.andP;  Then, by means of the cursor on thetransmitting system, it is possible to define an area or areas that can bemodified.andP;  Just the updates to the screen are sent.andM;At the same time, the operator can be in voice contact.andP;  It is possible alsoto send a batch of pictures in nonpeak times and have them written to disk atthe remote site and retrieved later for viewing.andM;The system should be useful in viewing images at a remote site to selectwhich ones should be transmitted at full resolution for production.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
