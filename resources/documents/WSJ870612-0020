Negotiations for the sale of a powerful supercomputer to India -- which many viewed as the symbol of a new U.S.-Indian relationship -- are adrift. A plan to provide U.S. technological help for an Indian combat aircraft has been awaiting a response from New Delhi for seven months.    Though some delays can be attributed to the near-gridlock that afflicts bureaucratic dealings in India, other factors are at work. Faced with growing political opposition at home, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who once championed high-technology commerce with the U.S., is resorting to familiar Indian anti-American rhetoric. And the growing U.S. commitment to Pakistan, India's archrival, is exacerbating the strains.    &quot;We seem to sort of be in a funk with India,&quot; says a Pentagon official who has worked for the past two years on U.S.-Indian projects.    Indian officials say they're disillusioned. &quot;The Reagan administration is perceived in India as being unable to deliver,&quot; says one Indian diplomat.    The foundering of the supercomputer talks is the most upsetting to many U.S. officials, who hoped a sale would inaugurate a new era of high-technology sales to the huge Asian democracy. But after months of wrangling over whether India would protect the computer from Soviet espionage, the U.S. proposed selling a system that falls short of state-of-the-art technology India wants.    India hasn't formally rejected the offer, but its frosty response has at least one U.S. negotiator worried that the sale &quot;is sort of drifting away.&quot;    One Indian official complains that &quot;the administration raised the level of expectations,&quot; then reneged. Specifically, he says U.S. negotiators allowed their Indian counterparts to operate under the assumption that they could acquire a Cray Research Inc. XMP-24 supercomputer, which is more powerful than the XMP-14 the U.S. currently says it would license. Pentagon technology-control experts say they were never willing to permit sale of the more-advanced model.    &quot;It isn't moving forward at this time,&quot; says Robert Gaertner, a Cray vice president. Moreover, more than just the India sale is at stake for Cray. &quot;It's an order we consider very important,&quot; Mr. Gaertner adds. &quot;This is not just a piece of equipment but a signal to other developing countries.&quot;    Another part of the problem isn't technology but Indian politics. Prime Minister Gandhi's Congress Party has lost a string of state elections in the past two years and faces an important electoral test this month in Haryana, a northern state bordering the Punjab, where Sikh unrest continues to vex the regime.    As U.S. officials see it, much of the anti-Americanism, including the anger over the supercomputer snafu, is part of the local political drama. &quot;It's an old Indian approach,&quot; says a Defense Department official. &quot;When problems begin at home, you blame things on foreign intervention.&quot;    But if Indian officials openly disparage the U.S. supercomputer offer for too long, warns a State Department official, &quot;the harder it may be to step up to it politically&quot; at some later time. &quot;The way it comes out in the press in India is that America is unloading a piece of junk,&quot; says one Indian official.    The Indian government wants the supercomputer to help predict monsoon patterns; they say that such knowledge could help boost crop production substantially. If the U.S. supercomputer talks collapse, India can turn to Japan, which is poised to step in with its own supercomputer offer. For the time being, the Japanese are holding back to avoid worsening their already frayed trade relations in Washington.    U.S. negotiators have tried to mollify the Indians by promising an upgrade of the supercomputer, or the sale of a newer model in two years. U.S. officials reason that the Indians will need nearly two years to become proficient in supercomputers. And even at the proposed level of technology, argues one Pentagon official, &quot;India could have been the only country outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to get so advanced a computer.&quot;    U.S.-Indian relations also have been poisoned by worsening tensions between India and neighboring Pakistan. The two countries have fought three wars since 1947, and nearly stumbled into a border skirmish several months ago. The Reagan administration wants to pour more money into the Pakistan military to help it counter threats from Soviet-backed Afghans on its other border.    As Indians see it, the U.S. plans to make Pakistan its major ally in Southwest Asia. &quot;You're being hooked into it&quot; by Pakistan, warns K. Subrahmanyam, director of India's Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses.    Most controversial is the possible sale to Pakistan of a U.S. Awacs early-warning plane. Though U.S. officials say the plane, a Boeing 707 equipped with a large radar dome and filled with computers, would help the Pakistan air force detect attacks from Afghanistan, Indian officials say the Awacs would be used against India.    Some U.S. officials voice confidence that U.S.-Indian commerce will weather the squalls. &quot;I see no insoluble problems,&quot; says former Republican Sen. Charles Percy, a private consultant with close ties to the Gandhi family. &quot;All bureaucracies take time to get things done, but I'm not the least bit discouraged.&quot;    Indeed, amid the America-bashing from New Delhi, less conspicuous talks go on at lower levels. The Indian chief of naval operations visited the Pentagon last month, and U.S. ship visits in India continue.    And while the Indian government hasn't formally responded to Pentagon proposals for collaboration on an Indian combat aircraft, there are conversations with Northrop Corp. and other U.S. companies about parts for the planned aircraft. Overall, says a U.S. businessman, &quot;there are some good areas and some bad areas.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
