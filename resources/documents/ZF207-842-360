(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A Relational Successor?andM;The story of object-oriented database technology is emerging with a familiarring.andP;  Like relational database technology 10 years ago, object-orienteddatabase management systems (OODBMS) have scholarly champions, a short listof start-up developers and interest from major computer and softwarecompanies.andM;But the technology, an offshoot of object-oriented programming, differs fromits relational predecessor in three principal ways: it supportsencapsulation, the ability to store as data elements both data and themethods or processes that act on that data; inheritance, the ability tocreate new data objects from existing ones while maintaining the history ofincremental modifications to the data objects; and polymorphism, the abilityof processes to be applied uniformly to a variety of objects.andM;These differences may be enough to enable OODBMSs to leap from academicconversation piece to empirical reality.andP;  There are many today in academiaand industry who say that object-oriented technology offers unique advantagesfor modeling complex systems, manipulating large data objects and capturingchanges in data over time.andM;&quot;In OODBMSs, we're actually talking about capturing some amount ofapplication code in the database itself,&quot; says Stan Zdonik, a BrownUniversity professor of computer science who is conducting research intoobject-oriented databases.andM;More than anything, though, advocates say object-oriented databases arebetter at storing complex information and real world data than are othertypes of databases.andP;  &quot;The advantage of OODBMSs is that they move closer tothe real world,&quot; managing larger and larger pieces of unstructured data, saysRalph Brueggemann, manager of data management engineering at Cincom SystemsInc.andP;  &quot;Most of the data in the world is unstructured.&quot;andM;The ease at which object-oriented databases model real world data has alreadycaught the attention of mechanical design and software engineers.andP;  Mostfirst-wave users of the technology are applying it in these applications.andO;Others, in everything from expert systems to document managementapplications, are starting to take notice.andP;  Eastman Kodak Co., for instance,is investing in OODBMS research and in a start-up vendor.andP;  &quot;If it holds toits promise, we will use it in products,&quot; says Bob Gordon, assistant managerof Kodak's Boston Technology Center.andM;Ideal ApplicationsandM;Because object-oriented databases store processes and data together, theyoften are better suited for large design applications than are other types ofdatabases, say advocates.andP;  &quot;In design applications, the objects really existin the database,&quot; explains Thomas Atwood, president of database start-upObject Design Inc. of Burlington, Mass.andP;  &quot;Where a typical relational systemcan take 1,000 instructions to fetch a field out of a record, [programmers]want it to happen in two or three instructions.&quot;andM;In addition, inheritance simplifies the creation of design and computer-aidedsoftware engineering (CASE) applications.andP;  &quot;You want to track not justobjects, but objects as they evolve over time.andP;  That's really important forthese design applications,&quot; says Atwood.andP;  For instance, inheritance allowstool designers to create new parts or tools from existing ones.andP;  Inheritancealso enables software developers to readily develop new software fromexisting modules.andM;Such OODBMS features are luring US West Advanced Technologies of Englewood,Colo., and Index Technology Corp. of Cambridge, Mass., to incorporate thetechnology in upcoming CASE systems.andP;  US West is using an object database atthe core of a software analysis and maintenance project, says MohammadKetabchi, the project's leader and a professor at the University of SantaClara.andP;  Index is building the next generation of its Excelerator analysis anddesign package with it, says Jerry Katzke, Index's vice president of softwaredevelopment.andM;Into the MainstreamandM;Yet, while object-oriented database technology is not limited to designapplications, few today consider it mature enough for mainstream systems.andO;Object Design's Atwood believes it may not be mature for IS applicationsuntil the mid-1990s.andP;  Others wonder whether object-oriented databases willever truly challenge existing database models for ordinary applications.andO;&quot;The idea behind sequential data structures, even index data structures, hasstood us in good stead for almost 20 years.andP;  And they still do,&quot; says HarryReinstein, the chief executive officer of expert systems developer Aion Corp.andO;of Palo Alto.andM;One reason for these predictions of slow growth is the lack of toolsavailable to build object-oriented databases.andP;  &quot;It's an area everybody issuffering from,&quot; concedes Won Kim, an object database researcher at theMicroelectronics andamp; Computer Technology Corp. (MCC) in Austin, Texas.andP;  Anotherproblem is performance.andP;  &quot;We do not believe that OODBMSs will, at this point,give you production-grade performance,&quot; says Cincom's Brueggemann.andM;&quot;You can do anything with an RDBMS that you can with an OODBMS, except youhave to roll your own,&quot; adds Mark Hanner, a product manager at relationaldatabase vendor Relational Technology Inc. in Alameda, Calif.andM;Even as they acknowledge the potential of object technology, most currentdatabase developers say relational technology is still their chief pursuit.andO;&quot;Right now, we are putting all of our efforts into relational, to make sureall of its functionality is fully realized,&quot; says Larry Settle, the productmanager for CA-Datacom/DB at Computer Associates International Inc. in GardenCity, N.Y.andP;  &quot;The majority of business problems can be handled by relational[technology] with no major problem.&quot;andM;Relational AdvancesandM;Some database developers are modifying relational databases by tackling theknown drawbacks of relational technology, such as its inability to expressrelationships implicit in the data.andP;  Indeed, advanced features such asimproved connections and relationships among data elements are appearing inthese newer relational databases.andP;  These databases are being called &quot;extendedrelational databases&quot; by some and &quot;entity relationship databases&quot; by others.andO;But, unlike the object-oriented model, neither method nor process is storedwith the data or contained within the data structure of these modifiedrelational databases.andP;  In other words, what it does isn't locked into what itdoes it to.andM;Instances of such databases include Unisys Corp.'s Infoexec SIM (SemanticInformation Manager), which uses a subset of the semantic database model tobetter express real world information.andP;  Hewlett-Packard Co. also is workingon a database project, called IRIS, which uses elements from theobject-oriented model and the entity relationship model.andP;  Software AG ofReston, Va., is adding entity relationships to Adabas in a new product calledAdabas Entire.andP;  The product, which recognizes relationships, is described bythe company as an &quot;object-oriented entity relationship database.&quot;andM;Such entity relationship databases differ from traditional relationalapproaches in that they are able to express relationships among data.andP;  Yet,because they do not store data and applications together, they are notconsidered object-oriented databases by researchers such as MCC's Kim.andO;However, advocates of these entity relationship databases prefer to describethem more in terms of what they do than in terms of what relationaltechnology does not do.andM;&quot;RDBMSs emphasize the syntax of data; entity relationships look at thesemantics of data,&quot; says Richard Benneworth, vice president of technology atSterling Software Inc.'s Zanthe Systems Division in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.andO;Zanthe has developed an entity relationship DBMS called ZIM.andM;Object-oriented technology is also being used to extend the relational model.andO;For example, in its Supra software, Cincom is using object technology toextend the relational model in semantic areas not covered by Structured QueryLanguage (SQL).andP;  &quot;I believe other companies are using this approach, becausewe do keep in touch with other companies,&quot; says Cincom's Brueggemann.andP;  RTIcofounder Michael Stonebraker, who developed the initial version of thefirm's Ingres database while at the University of California at Berkeley,also is working on an extended relational database project called Postgres.andM;Database IntegrationandM;Others are finding ways to integrate object-oriented and relationaltechnologies indirectly.andP;  For instance, Sybase Inc. of Emeryville, Calif., isworking with object database maker Servio Logic Corp. to develop front-endand back-end extensions to the Sybase database.andP;  &quot;The future is applicationsthat talk to a number of servers.andP;  One will be a relational server, forinformation that fits into relational systems.andP;  Another could be anobject-oriented server, for information that is more appropriate for that[technology],&quot; says Sybase marketing director Rich Scheffer.andM;Object-handling capabilities for IBM's relational Database 2 (DB2) may alsobe coming, according to Kenneth Paris, director of database technology atPeat Marwick Main andamp; Co. and a member of the board of directors of theInternational DB2 Users Group.andP;  IBM, says Paris, has told some DB2 users thatobject-handling capabilities are on its to-do list for DB2.andP;  But, he says, &quot;Idon't think [object capabilities] are as hot as availability andperformance.&quot;andM;At MCC, a hot-bed of object database development, Kim is devising a way forobject-oriented databases to retrieve data from relational databases.andP;  Kim isone of a handful of researchers in the technology.andP;  Others are Brown'sZdonik, David Maier at the Oregon Graduate Center in Beaverton, and RTI'sStonebraker.andP;  Kim, director of MCC's object-oriented and distributed systemslaboratory, developed an OODBMS called Orion with funding from BellCommunications Research Inc. (Bellcore), Control Data Corp., DigitalEquipment Corp., Harris Corp., Kodak and NCR Corp.andP;  A distributed version ofthe database is expected to be commercialized soon by one of these companies,according to MCC officials.andM;A Small PondandM;Despite the high level of research activities, the market outlook for objectdatabases is tiny.andP;  Some place this year's sales as high as $10 million.andP;  ButBob Field, president of OODBMS vendor Objectivity Inc., believes &quot;it'ssomewhere between zero and $5 million.&quot;andP;  Nevertheless, promising applicationsin CASE, expert systems and design have start-ups and some existing databasefirms anticipating a profitable future.andP;  For example, RTI's Hanner estimatesthe market for object databases could quickly soar within a few years to $100million.andM;Focusing on this potential are the pioneers: Ontologic Inc. in Billerica,Mass.; Servio Logic; and Symbolics Inc. of Burlington, Mass.andP;  All of thesecompanies began selling object databases last year.andP;  A second start-up waveis due to ship products next year.andP;  Some of these vendors previewed databasesat last month's Object Oriented Programming Systems, Languages, andApplications conference in New Orleans.andP;  Among this new wave of companiesare: Object Design, Objectivity and Object-Sciences Corp. of Menlo Park,Calif.andM;Whether these start-ups are enough to bring the object database out from itsresearch origins and into broader use is uncertain.andP;  Even vendors inapplication niches considered ideal for object database technology have theirdoubts.andP;  &quot;I think the underlying storage mechanism will ultimately be one ofthe traditional database management systems, very likely a relationaldatabase manager,&quot; says Aion CEO Reinstein.andP;  &quot;There simply aren't very manypeople out there who want to go to a new database management strategy.&quot;andM;If such comments appear to bury object technology, that's only another way tocompare object databases to relational technology.andP;  After all, complaintsabout SQL have never stopped.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
