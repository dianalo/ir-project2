The next reapportionment will be based on the final 1990 Censusfigures, which will be collected in the 10-year census next year.The state population figures released today go up to mid-1989 andrepresent one last checkpoint before the final, official count.   The non-profit Population Reference Bureau said that if thetrends in this latest report hold true through the final 1990figures, California will gain seven seats, Texas and Florida eachwill gain three, and Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizonawill gain one apiece.   At the same time, 11 states are likely to lose one or moreseats, the Population Reference Bureau said. It said New York willlose three seats, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois eachwill lose two, and New Jersey, Massachusetts, Iowa, Kansas, WestVirginia and Montana each will lose one.   Comparable predictions by Election Data Services Inc., aWashington-based political consulting firm, differed little. Thefirm, however, added Kentucky to the list of losers, dropping onecongressional seat, and predicted that Florida will gain fourseats, rather than three.   However, the Census Bureau figures on which the predictions arebased do not include members of the military and their dependentsliving overseas. They will be counted in the 1990 reapportionment,the government recently announced, and that change could mean thedifference in whether some states gain or lose a seat.   The Census figures show that the populations of five states grewat rates faster than 10 percent from 1985 to mid-1989.   The state that experienced the largest percentage increase inpopulation between 1985 and mid-1989, Nevada, grew by 18 percent.Second was Arizona, 12 percent, followed by Florida and NewHampshire at 11 percent and California at 10 percent.   At the same time, seven states lost population, the bureau said:Iowa, North Dakota, Montana, West Virginia, Wyoming, Louisiana andOklahoma.</TEXT></DOC>
