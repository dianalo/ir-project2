As well as reduced high-frequency resolution, someoutput light can be detected at distances as great as a few millimetersfrom the input image. This long-range light spreading is called veilingglare. In this paper we present measurements and propose the cause ofthe F4113's veiling glare. The most probable cause is electron scatteringat the front surface of the microchannel plate, with some contributiondue to electron scattering at the phosphor. The cause of reduced resolutionat higher spatial frequencies is also discussed. This is most likelydue to the combined effects of phosphor thickness, photographic filmthickness and the high numerical aperture of the fiber optics. Finally,some improvements have recently been made to the F4113. These are describedand possible additional improvements are suggested. 7 refs., 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
