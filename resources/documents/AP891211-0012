(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bison that blunder over the line fromYellowstone National Park are fair game for hunters again thiswinter, but park officials expect the harvest to be smaller thanthe 500 taken last season.   Just how many of the big, furry, dumb beasts will wander outsidethe park boundaries to graze depends on how severe the winter isand how pinched the food supply within the park, officials say.Hunters aren't allowed to shoot buffalo in the park.   But statements by a leading zoologist have added weight to thestate's contention that the slaughter of wandering bison isnecessary to prevent the spread of brucellosis among Montana cattleherds, despite the outrage such killings may produce.   Dr. Don Davis, a Texas Aandamp;M University specialist in the highlyinfectious bacterial disease, said previous claims by parkofficials that the bison bug could not be transmitted to cattlehave proven false.   ``Montana has spent in excess of $260 million of federal andstate money to rid the domestic livestock of brucellosis,'' Davissaid. ``So you can see why you're not real crazy to get it backagain.''   Davis, scientific adviser to a committee on brucellosis inMontana, Wyoming and Idaho, said the National Park Service could domore to eradicate brucellosis in the Yellowstone herds by isolatingand slaughtering infected bison.   But that would mean killing the animals on park property, andthat isn't going to happen, he said.   ``We're talking big-time political and economic concessions ifthey were to do that,'' Davis said.   The Park Service says that unless scientists can provebrucellosis was not in the park when Yellowstone was created in1872, it may classify the bacteria as a ``native species.'' Parkpolicy forbids eradication of any native species.   Eradicating brucellosis from the buffalo herd could proveuseless if the organism is native to the area and simply reinfectsthe animals, said Yellowstone spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo. And thebuffalo would no longer be a wild, free-roaming species if theywere treated like domestic cattle, she said.   Brucellosis, also called Bang's disease, causes domestic cattleto lose their calves. It can cause undulant fever _ characterizedby recurring fever and aching joints _ in humans who get it throughunpasteurized milk or direct contact with infected animals. Itgenerally can't be transmitted through meat.   The U.S. Agriculture Department has been trying for decades toeliminate the disease from commercial herds. So far, USDA says, 27states are free of brucellosis, with the disease most prevalent inthe South. Brucellosis was eradicated from Montana cattle in 1984.   Last year, due to food shortages caused by the massive 1988forest fires and an ensuing harsh winter, hundreds of hungry bisonwandered north onto Montana cattle ranches.   Hunters were called in to snag strays, and a record 569 bisonwere killed. Of these about half were found to be infected withbrucellosis. Park officials counted 418 buffalo in the northernherd last week and estimate a park total of about 2,000 animals inthe park's three major herds.   Wyoming, where most of Yellowstone is located, does not permitthe shooting of stray bison.   Animal rights activists sought unsuccessfully to stop lastyear's hunt, which to some was sadly reminiscent of the massivebuffalo slaughter of a century ago that signalled the final tamingof the Wild West.   Although the bison season legally began Oct. 1, it does notactually start until and unless bison begin leaving the park. Thatusually happens in December, although it may not happen at all ifthe winter is mild.   ``The biologists can't predict whether they'll move as they didlast year,'' Anzelmo said. ``We hope not. Maybe only a few willleave the park.''   Previously officials have said they expect no more than 200 tobe harvested this year.   In preparation for the hunt, 3,217 people have paid $5 to applyfor a bison permit. If summoned by the wildlife department to hunt,Montanans pay $200 for a license, while non-residents pay $1,000.   The hunt itself is less than thrilling. Buffalo are accustomedto seeing humans, and game wardens lead each hunter directly to theanimal to be killed. The hunters shoot at close range at animalsthat often are standing still, grazing.</TEXT></DOC>
