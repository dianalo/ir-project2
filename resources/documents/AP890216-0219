One study, based on nationwide death statistics, suggests thatthe trend results largely from new Medicare rules that pay hospitalsflat fees for taking care of the elderly. This approach gives them afinancial incentive to keep patients' hospital stays as short aspossible.   ``What has to be said is that hospitals are in a bind becausethey are being pressured by cost cutting,'' said Dr. Mark A. Sager,who directed the study. ``Nursing homes are in a bind because nobodywants to pay for nursing home care. Patients are in a bind becausethey are in a system that does not want to provide continuity ofcare and health care financing is fragmented.''   His research showed that the number of elderly Americans dying innursing homes rose sharply during the 1980s, while fewer died inhospitals.</TEXT><DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

Newly declassified documents indicate that luck, as well asskill, played a great role in resolving the world's last majornuclear crisis 27 years ago, Soviet and American experts at HarvardUniversity said Wednesday.   Kennedy and Khrushchev made key decisions based on seriousmisperceptions and faulty intelligence, which, however, may havehelped to resolve the crisis as well as to start it, said Graham T.Allison, dean of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.   ``Looking at it in retrospect, with all the new information, Istill give high marks to President Kennedy and ... also, perhapssurprisingly, to Khrushchev, for the degree of control they tried toexercise,'' said Allison, author of ``Essence of Decision,'' one ofthe authoritative books on the crisis.</TEXT></DOC>
