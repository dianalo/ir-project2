House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.), who had been predicting the talks will conclude next week, said yesterday that the White House and congressional negotiators might be on the way to getting &quot;an earlier agreement than I thought.&quot;    Negotiators said the two sides aren't far apart in such important areas as military spending and tax increases. But significant work remained ahead. &quot;This is not just a simple matter of splitting the differences,&quot; said Rep. Leon Panetta (D., Calif.), one of the negotiators. &quot;It's a matter of priorities, and they are still very different.&quot;    The negotiators appear to be concentrating on a package that wouldn't do much more than avert the $23 billion across-the-board spending cut that is slated to take effect Nov. 20. However, some negotiators still hold out hope that a larger package can emerge from the talks, which have lasted more than two weeks.    The new Democratic proposal made yesterday would reduce the projected deficit in the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, by $33.8 billion. However, $5.3 billion of that is a refinancing plan for the Rural Electrification Administration that doesn't qualify as a deficit-reduction measure under the Gramm-Rudman law.    The proposal would raise taxes by $12 billion, reduce projected military spending by $5.4 billion, cut estimated nonmilitary spending in discretionary accounts by $2.4 billion, and reduce entitlement spending, such as Medicare and farm subsidies, by $4.2 billion. A discretionary program is one for which spending can be changed without amending underlying laws. The plan doesn't tamper with Social Security.    &quot;We find it totally unacceptable,&quot; said Rep. Trent Lott (R., Miss.). Added Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), &quot;It's far too heavy on the tax side and far too low (on) reliable domestic restraint. The total savings on defense are unattainable.&quot;    After the cool reception, negotiators set aside the Democrats' plan and began re-examining the many options that had been laid before them. The meeting ended yesterday optimistically as participants pointed to the progress on such issues as military spending and tax increases.    &quot;We see the parameters,&quot; one lawmaker said. The negotiators plan to meet today, despite the Veterans Day holiday break.    The participants are moving toward an agreement that is little more than an outline. Each major category of spending and taxes would be given a dollar figure representing a deficit-reduction target, which individual committees in Congress would have to meet.    Fleshing out those deficit-cutting goals is likely to be difficult, congressional aides said, and could take longer than the time remaining before the Nov. 20 deadline. One option being considered on Capitol Hill is to suspend the Gramm-Rudman law's automatic cuts in anticipation of the savings suggested by the negotiators' outline.    Time is running short to do otherwise. Tennessee Rep. John Duncan, the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, said an accord is needed by the end of the week in order to have a chance to beat the Nov. 20 deadline. </TEXT></DOC>
