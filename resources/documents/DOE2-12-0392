The result is P/sub {gamma}/= (2.7 +- 5.7) x 10/sup -4/. The reaction used was /sup 16/O({sup 3}He,p)/sup18/F with a 3.4 MeV {sup 3}He{sup +} beam of an intensity of 7 {mu}Aimpinging on a windowless water target. The circular polarization wasmeasured with a four-prong transmission-type Compton polarimeter. Themeasurement of the analyzing power of the polarimeter is presented. Gammarays were detected by means of 130 cm{sup 3} p-type germanium detectorsplaced behind the prongs. Four independent data acquisition channelswere used: pile-up losses at a counting rate of 60 kcps were kept lowerthan 15%, owing to the use of trapezoidal shapers. Systematic effectsof instrumental origin are discussed and found to give negligible contributionswith respect to the statistical uncertainty. The calculation of the asymmetriesis performed using different estimators; an extensive comparison of thevarious methods is presented. The result of the experiment, when averagedwith those of the other experiments on /sup 18/F carried out until now,gives a grand average P/sub {gamma}/ = (1.2 +- 3.9) x 10/sup -4/. Thisresult is compared with recent theoretical estimates.</TEXT></DOC>
