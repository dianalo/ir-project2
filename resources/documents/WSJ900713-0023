Last month, Time Warner filed a $100 million lawsuitagainst Pathe charging &quot;willful, wanton and malicious&quot; breachof contract in the collapse of that pact.</LP><TEXT>   In a statement, Time Warner said, &quot;Pathe's cross complaintis just its latest attempt to divert attention from thefacts, which are that Pathe breached its April 1990 agreementwith Time Warner, its theatrical distribution agreement withWarner Brothers and a video rights distribution agreementwith Warner Home Video.&quot;   Time Warner also said it intends to schedule thedepositions of Giancarlo Parretti, the head of Pathe, and oneof his partners immediately.   The Pathe suit, filed in state superior court here,charges, among other things, that Time Warner failed to honoran agreement to guarantee a $650 million bank loan or to loanPathe that amount itself. As part of that transaction, TimeWarner was going to obtain certain rights to the filmlibraries of United Artists, Pathe and its Cannon unit.   Time Warner has said the agreement collapsed after Pathefailed to come up with sufficient equity, taking onadditional debt instead. However, the latest suit contendsthat Pathe did meet its obligations to obtain $600 million innon-debt financing. The suit says Pathe met all otherconditions except those &quot;excused by the acts or conduct ofTime Warner.&quot; The suit alleges that Time Warner failed toprovide the $650 million loan to Pathe &quot;without anyreasonable explanation.&quot;   The Pathe suit says Time Warner was unable to find anoutside bank willing to lend Pathe $650 million, and it notesthat Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. placed Time Warner's debt on aCreditWatch list soon after the agreement. The suit says thatalthough it was unable to obtain the loan, Time Warner wasstill &quot;highly desirous&quot; of obtaining the rights to the filmlibraries, and it pressured Pathe to make a deal moreadvantageous to Time Warner.   The suit alleges that Time Warner &quot;knowingly put Pathe atrisk of losing the $200 million non-refundable deposit madeto MGM/UA&quot; and a $75 million security interest granted toMGM/UA. Pathe also contends that Time Warner's actions forcedPathe to renegotiate its agreement with MGM/UA, increasingthe cost of the acquisition by more than $200 million.</TEXT></DOC>
