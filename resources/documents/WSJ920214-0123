In recent days, the merged bank, which kept the Chemicalname, has been mailing to its customers a new fee structurethat reconciles pricing differences of the previous banks.</LP><TEXT>   But in setting new pricing for its consumer products andservices, Chemical turned more often to the higher fees ofthe two banks, thus increasing costs for most consumers.   &quot;It appears they're going to the higher end of the scale,&quot;said Glenn VonNostitz, assistant commissioner for New YorkCity's consumer affairs department. &quot;It shows that therewon't be a decline in fees and little competition in the NewYork area.&quot;   But Chemical customers aren't alone. A number of studies,including one by the Federal Reserve, note that aftermergers, consumers ended up paying more for services,particularly in unions that led to fewer players in aparticular market. The Chemical merger created thesecond-largest bank in the U.S., pushing Chemical ahead ofChase Manhattan Corp. as the second-biggest consumer bank inthe New York area, behind Citicorp.   In particular, customers of the old Chemical, which hadbeen one of the lower-priced banks in New York, will findservice fees similiar to higher fees charged by Citicorp andChase.   &quot;The savings from increased efficiency as a result ofmergers benefit shareholders and investors,&quot; said PeggyMiller, banking analyst with Consumer Federation of America,a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. &quot;Consumers don't end upwith much.&quot;   Chemical officials, however, insisted that the new feestructure was &quot;revenue neutral&quot; and that the bank would notgain any additional profits from the changes. &quot;We're nottrying to choose the higher price in every case, and in fact,we didn't,&quot; said John J. Stack, head of domestic branchoperations.   He noted, for example, that some old Chemical customerswill benefit from the addition of the new &quot;regular&quot; checkingaccount that halves the minimum balance requirement to $1,500before a penalty fee is assessed. Previously, a Chemicalcustomer would have been assessed a monthly fee of $8whenever his or her checking balance fell below $3,000. Theminimum balance required at Chase and Citicorp is $3,000.   On the other hand, the penalty fee for falling below theminimum balance requirement rose to $9.50, higher than whatCiticorp and Chase charge. As well, Manufacturers customerswho had the so-called relationship checking account --checking linked to savings or money market accounts -- willhave until the end of the year to boost their minimum balanceto $3,000 from $1,500 to avoid paying a $9.50 monthly fee.   Despite the higher prices, banking experts said Chemicalis unlikely to lose many customers. They note that mostoften, consumers look for location of the facility and thequality of service rather than cost. &quot;I could go to anotherbank, but I'm not going to walk another 10 blocks to save abuck,&quot; said Mr. VonNostitz.</TEXT></DOC>
