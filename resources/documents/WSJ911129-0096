The legislators rejected most of President Bush'sproposals to expand banks' business horizons. Instead, theyapproved on Wednesday a much tougher regulatory system. Andmany bankers and analysts think that Congress went too far.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This legislation creates a system of arbitrary, Draconianand inflexible regulatory criteria designed to ensure that nobank will ever again fail,&quot; says Karen Shaw, president of theInstitute for Strategy Development, a financial consultingfirm here. &quot;In pursuit of this Quixotic goal, the legislationwill ensure that while few banks ever fail, none will everprosper.&quot;   The new legislation will require regulators to move morequickly to correct problems and to close banks before theybecome insolvent. It will limit the Federal Reserve Board'sability to keep sick banks alive. And it will end the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp.'s authority to reimburse uninsureddeposits -- those over $100,000 and foreign accounts -- whenlarge banks fail. That change may make the Fed even moreeager to protect major institutions.   The tougher regulation is a political quid pro quo for $70billion needed to shore up the Bank Insurance Fund, which hasbeen drained by more than 1,100 bank failures since 1984.Congress blames regulators for responding too slowly toemerging problems. &quot;Very little corrective action was takenearly in the game,&quot; says Senate Banking Committee ChairmanDonald Riegle, a Michigan Democrat.   The law's early-intervention provisions will force banksand regulators to address problems quickly. But bankers saythe legislation will make it harder for them to lend,precisely when the administration is pressing them to spurthe economy with easier credit.   Bankers also worry that, as more banks fail, the premiumsthat the survivors pay for deposit insurance will risesharply to repay Bank Insurance Fund borrowings from theTreasury. &quot;Every time you raise the fees is money off thebottom line,&quot; says John B. McCoy, chairman of Banc One Corp.in Columbus, Ohio.   Consumers may end up paying much of the premium increases.&quot;Next time you have a drop in auto rates, maybe you drop itnine-tenths of a point rather than a full point,&quot; heexplains. The higher premiums &quot;will increase the cost forconsumers to do business&quot; and thus could hurt banks and theeconomy, he says. &quot;Maybe the consumer doesn't borrow the nexttime.&quot;   Over time, predicts Robert Litan of the BrookingsInstitution, the legislation will strengthen banks; but inthe short term, he fears, it could exacerbate the creditsqueeze. &quot;We've got policies at the federal level going inopposite directions,&quot; he contends. &quot;The Treasury says, `Easeup'; the legislation says, `Tighten up.'&quot;   Yet Mr. Litan doesn't denounce the bill. &quot;As taxpayers,&quot;he says, &quot;we should feel that this is better than nothing atall. We got the money to protect deposit insurance. We gotnew regulations&quot; to promote sounder banking. So, he thinks&quot;this is modest good news for taxpayers.&quot;   In essence, the new law will force regulators to pull thetrigger much sooner on sick banks. Regulation will be tied tobank capital, and when capital declines, regulators will berequired to take &quot;prompt corrective action&quot; -- such as capson growth, reductions or suspensions of dividends, stocksales to raise capital, and management changes. And they evenwill be permitted to close banks when the institutions' ratioof capital to assets falls to 2%. At least 100 small andmedium-sized banks could be closed down under this rule, oneanalyst estimates.   &quot;The penalties are so severe if you drop below the topcapital standards that banks will simply have to run atcushions above those levels,&quot; says Paul Homan, the chairmanof First Florida Banks Inc. &quot;I've discussed this with myboard. We don't want to come under that tight scrutiny. Allour plans are to move to a comfortable cushion&quot; of capital.   The new law, which regulators must translate into rules,is likely to force many banks to boost capital -- a difficulttask when many are already suffering from low earnings andlow stock prices. While strong banks such as NCNB Corp. andBankAmerica Corp. will be able to raise capital, weaker onesmay have to look for merger partners. &quot;Mergers will be theonly way out,&quot; says Edward Furash, managing partner at Furashandamp; Co., a consulting firm. &quot;It's a Darwinian solution -- onlythe stronger will survive.&quot;   Bank shareholders could be hurt in two ways. Some banksprobably will have to sell more stock to raise capital,diluting the value of current holdings. And if capital fallsto a critical level and regulators close a bank before it'sinsolvent, stockholders &quot;will get wiped out earlier than theythought,&quot; Mr. Furash says.   The changes could hurt borrowers as well. Some weaklycapitalized regional banks and large money-center banks willhave difficulty lending to the fast-growing and midsizedcompanies that rely primarily on banks for credit. And StevenWechsler, president of the National Realty Committee, whichrepresents real-estate interests in Washington, worries thatthe new rules &quot;may very well compound the problem we'reliving with today&quot; -- the difficulty in rolling over existingloans or getting new credit.   Even big companies that are grappling with financialproblems and reduced credit ratings will suffer, says CharlesPeabody, a banking analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. &quot;You'regoing to find that these rules and regulations are going tomake banks think a little more about whether they want tofund these high-risk credits,&quot; he says.   But some bankers who have survived corrective regulationwhen their banks were in trouble don't object to the toughnew standards. &quot;People and institutions can and will respondto pressure,&quot; says A.W. &quot;Tom&quot; Clausen, who guided Bank ofAmerica out of trouble in the 1980s.   &quot;Forbearance is what got us into the Sandamp;L mess. We need theopposite,&quot; he says. &quot;We need a clear-cut system of regulationthat rewards banks with strong ratings by letting them enternew lines of business and expand their operations. And weneed swift and certain sanctions for institutions with poorratings. We also need a trigger level that will force quick,mandatory regulatory intervention to liquidate or to holdshotgun weddings for failing institutions.&quot;   But Congress is providing only half of the Clausenequation: the tough regulations, without commensuraterewards.   Over the past 10 months, Congress killed most of anadministration plan to modernize the banking system byallowing well-capitalized banks to set up nationwide branchsystems and to become financial supermarkets offering a broadrange of insurance and securities products and services. Suchbanks also would have been allowed to affiliate withcommercial corporations, such as Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called the measure a&quot;pale shadow&quot; of what's needed to strengthen the bankingsystem and criticized Congress for backing away from reformsdesigned to reduce the chances that taxpayers ultimately willhave to bail out the Bank Insurance Fund.   But President Bush never fought hard for his plan, and theTreasury couldn't marshal broad support for it. Initially,the administration and large banks -- those that would havebenefited most from its proposals -- assumed that the need torecapitalize the Bank Insurance Fund would pull through plansto modernize a web of Depression-era bank laws. But the needfor funding had almost the opposite effect -- it remindedlawmakers of the savings-and-loan bailout and made themanxious to tighten bank regulation but reluctant to allowbanks into new business areas.   &quot;Voting the money was so controversial that what wethought was the engine driving the train turned out to be theanchor dragging down the ship,&quot; says Rep. Barney Frank, aMassachusetts Democrat.   In addition, the proposals encountered insurmountableobstacles: internecine warfare between big and little banks;opposition from insurance, securities and consumer groups;and disputes between the Treasury and Michigan DemocraticRep. John Dingell, the House godfather of securitiesregulation, over combining banks and brokers.   So, in Mr. Homan's view, banks are &quot;going to get the worstof both worlds: They're going to get these new regulations,and they're not going to get new powers.&quot;   But aside from the $70 billion loan to support depositinsurance, banks are getting something many have wanted foryears: an end to the &quot;too big to fail&quot; doctrine. Under thispolicy, which never was codified in law, regulators haveresolved bank failures in ways that end up protecting alldepositors, even those outside the deposit-insurance safetynet.   Although the policy bolstered confidence in the systemduring the recent wave of bank failures, banks complain thatreimbursing uninsured depositors helped deplete the insurancefund and forced huge increases in their insurance premiums.Premiums have nearly tripled to 23 cents per $100 of domesticdeposits in the past 18 months and could rise to 30 centsnext year as the industry begins repaying the new loan to thefund. With every one-cent rise in those premiums costing thebanking industry some $250 million a year, banks are anxiousto slow the increase.   The banking package would bar the FDIC from paying offuninsured depositors after Dec. 31, 1994. To grant anexception, the Fed, the FDIC and the administration mustdecide that all depositors should be reimbursed to prevent ajolt to the financial system. In the process, they wouldelevate what now is a bureaucratic decision to a much morevisible political level. This change is designed todiscourage even limited use of &quot;too big to fail.&quot;   In addition, the new law limits the Fed's ability to keepsick banks alive with long-term loans from its discountwindow. This also shrinks the federal safety net for banks inan effort to slow the drain on the insurance fund. A HouseBanking Committee study found that many banks failed despiteheavy support from the Fed, thereby increasing the cost tothe FDIC.   &quot;The Fed will be tougher&quot; on banks as a result of thesechanges, predicts Frederick Shultz, a former Fed vicechairman. With less flexibility to help banks once they getinto trouble, it will work harder to keep them out of it, hesays. Mr. Litan agrees: &quot;The Fed is going to be very nervousabout the banks walking too close to the edge. I think theFed is going to end up being the primary regulator for the 50largest banks,&quot; those whose problems could most easily setoff financial turmoil.   Although Mr. Shultz applauds the changes, he worries aboutrigid regulation. &quot;You want a regulator who is tough in goodtimes and gives you some flexibility in bad times,&quot; he says,adding that the stricter rules from Congress &quot;won't help.&quot;   Regulators, too, worry about the law trimming theirdiscretion. It will create &quot;a much more formulaic approach,&quot;says Susan Krause, senior deputy comptroller of the currencyfor supervision policy. &quot;We would always prefer supervisoryflexibility. We don't have as much mistrust in ourselves asthe legislators do.&quot;   Regulators and bankers worked behind the scenes to buildas much flexibility as possible into the new law, but theywere operating from a politically awkward position. Theprompt-corrective-action provisions were written largely inresponse to congressional concern about lax regulation. Andbanks found it difficult to oppose stiffer regulation whenthe insurance fund was getting a $70 billion line of credit.   Eventually, however, banks will benefit as the new lawsucceeds in reducing bank failures. Payments from theinsurance fund should slow, easing pressure for premiumincreases. And John Medlin, the chairman of First WachoviaCorp., applauds provisions permitting regulators to takeover, merge or sell banks before they become insolvent. &quot;Byallowing regulators to move in when a bank is still salable-- when it has more meat on its bones -- some money can besaved,&quot; he says.   The new regulatory plan is designed to encourage banks tooperate safely and with ample capital to cushion againstfailure. &quot;It will change bank decision-making and behavior,&quot;says Steven Roberts, partner at KPMG Peat Marwick. &quot;You can'tput off hard decisions.&quot;   But some observers doubt that the new law will make banksany safer. Says Mr. Furash of the consulting firm: &quot;Thebottom line is the bill doesn't help the outlook for bankingone bit. It ignores 20 years of decaying earnings. . . .Congress walked away from the worst financial crisis thecountry has faced since the 1930s.&quot;   ---   Staff reporter Steven Lipin contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
