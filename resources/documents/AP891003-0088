The Khmer People's National Liberation Front and two otherguerrilla factions launched what they called a ``generaloffensive'' against the pro-Hanoi government on Saturday. Theyclaimed to have overrun three towns and many other militarypositions.   The guerrillas called it their biggest victory in about 11 yearsof guerrilla warfare.   Vietnam, which previously fought alongside Cambodian governmentforces after invading the country in 1978, says it withdrew itstroops a week ago.   Thailand's Foreign Ministry claimed today that it held fiveVietnamese soldiers in Thailand's Chanthaburi province who werecaptured in Cambodia since the pledged pullout.   However, the Thai navy, which is responsible for the southernpart of Thailand's border with Cambodia including Chanthaburi, saidthis was untrue.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Prachadavi Tavetikul said he plannedto show the Vietnamese to the press on Thursday, even though Capt.Buncherd Phunchoren, a Royal Thai Navy spokesman, said there hadbeen no arrest or detention of any soldier since Sept. 20.   In the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet heavy shelling andautomatic weapons fire could be heard all day to the north and tothe south across the border in Cambodia.   Western sources on the frontier following battlefield movementssaid the guerrillas were concentrating their forces on the town ofKandoun, inside Cambodia some nine miles from Thailand. The sourcesspoke on condition of anonymity.   The guerrillas also were attempting to prevent the resupply ofgovernment positions, they said.   No reliable reports of casualties have emerged either from theguerrillas or the government. Phnom Penh official media have notcommented on the most recent fighting.   Ieng Mouly, spokesman for the KPNLF in Bangkok, said theoffensive was a coordinated effort between the three guerrillafactions; his own, those loyal to exiled monarch Prince NorodomSihanouk and the radical communist Khmer Rouge.   The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodiansduring its rule from 1975 until its forces were ousted by theVietnamese in late 1978.</TEXT></DOC>
