Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to a mattress and more particularly to one      having a flexible foot guard mounted thereto. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of Related Art </PAR><PAR>  The conventional mattress for sleeping is flat. It is generally experienced      by a lot of people, when sleeping face-up on the mattress, that the weight      of comforter or blanket presses on the upward pointed toes of the feet.      Particularly in cold seasons, when heavy weight comforter is used and      additional covers are put on the foot area, this causes discomfort to the      pointed toes of the feet as the toes have to support substantial weight of      the covers. Because of the pressure on the toes, it is hard for the person      to fall asleep unless he changes his sleeping position or tilts his feet.      It is especially bothersome to tall people. Even for light electrical      blanket, the weight is still beyond the endurance of the toes for      supporting the blanket for a long time. Moreover, the electrical blanket      has no heating elements at its edge area and thus does not supply      additional heat to the foot area where it usually needs more warmth,      especially for elderly people. </PAR><PAR>  Although the old style bed had rails or board at foot end, the hard foot      end guard is only for restricting the bed clothes from slipping off the      bed. It has nothing to do with supporting bed coverings and reducing the      weight on the feet, or warming up the feet area. Besides, the hard foot      end guard is uncomfortable to the feet. </PAR><PAR>  In order to preserve the elasticity of spring mattresses, it is recommended      that such mattresses be periodically turned over. In view of such      desirable turning, the fixed positioning of a foot guard on a mattress is      impractical. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Accordingly, the present invention provides a flexible or soft member at      foot end of a mattress which extends about foot high above the mattress      surface for supporting comforter or blanket at the foot end area. It is      detachably and/or pivotably coupled to the mattress for use with either      side of the mattress. Provision may be made for selective positioning of      the foot guard along the length of the mattress. </PAR><PAR>  Further, the flexible member can be detachably mounted at either of the      opposite ends of the mattress with identical mounting means thereon. </PAR><PAR>  Moreover, the flexible member has electrical heating device and thermostat      control, similar to the existing electrical blanket heating system, for      warming up the feet area. </PAR><PAR>  Furthermore, the flexible member is applicable to water bed. </PAR><PAR>  The flexible member is an elongated cylindrical column, in one of various      cross-sectional shapes depending on the mounting means used. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  In the accompanying drawings: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a side elevation view of a bed with a person sleeping facing      upward on a mattress covered by a comforter which is partially removed to      show a foot guard at the mattress foot end in accordance with one      embodiment of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is an elevation view of the mattress foot end taken in the plane      indicated by line 2--2 of FIG. 1 but having the comforter removed; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a side elevation view of the holding unit for the foot guard in      accordance with one embodiment of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is an elevation view of a mattress foot end showing another      configuration of the pivotable mechanism for the foot guard; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a side elevation view taken in the plane indicated by line 5--5      of FIG. 4 showing the holding unit of the foot guard and the mattress,      dotted lines showing the pivotable movement and positions of the foot      guard when the holding unit is not installed; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a mattress foot end elevation view showing a detachable means of      mounting the foot guard on the mattress foot end in accordance with one      embodiment of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a side elevation view taken in the plane indicated by line 7--7      of FIG. 6; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a side elevation view showing another detachable means of      installing the foot guard on the mattress foot end; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a side elevation view showing a further embodiment of detachable      attachment of the foot guard to the mattress; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 is a detail view showing the alternate attachment of holding pins      to the foot guard; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 is a partial view showing the configuration of the foot guard      overhanging at the end of the mattress; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 12 is an end view taken along line 12--12 in FIG. 11; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 13 is a side elevation view of yet another embodiment of foot guard      attachment to the mattress; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 14 is an end view taken along line 14--14 in FIG. 13; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 15 is an end view of an embodiment modified from FIG. 14; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 16 is a side elevation view of still another embodiment of foot guard      attachment; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 17 is an end view taken along line 17--17 in FIG. 16; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 18 is a side elevation view of a further embodiment of foot guard      attachment; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 19 is an end view taken along line 19--19 in FIG. 18; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 20 is an side elevation view showing another pivotal attachment of      foot guard to the mattress; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 21 is an end view taken along line 21--21 in FIG. 20; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 22 is a side elevation view showing a foot guard as part of a bed      sheet or bed pad; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 23 is an end view taken along line 23--23 in FIG. 22. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  The following description is of the best presently contemplated mode of      carrying out the invention. This description is made for the purpose of      illustrating the general principles of the invention and should not be      taken in a limiting sense. The scope of the invention is best determined      by reference to the appended claims. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention is an improvement of the conventional flat mattresses      by providing a flexible or soft foot guard or protector transversely      mounted to the mattress at the foot end. The foot protector supports bed      clothes at the foot area to reduce the pressure on upward pointed toes of      the feet, as shown in FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  In FIGS. 1 and 2, a bed frame 11 at the bottom is connected to a vertical      head board 12. The frame 11 supports a box spring 13 and a mattress 14 on      which a person sleeps. The person sleeps facing upward on the mattress and      is covered by a comforter or blanket 15 which is supported by a foot      protector 17 nearby the feet. The foot protector 17 is cylindrical and it      can be pivotably or detachably coupled to the mattress 14. The pivotable      embodiment is first described in reference to FIGS. 1-5 In FIGS. 1 and 2,      a center rod 18 is fixedly connected by left and right links 19L and 19R      which are in turn pivotably connected to an axle 20 in the center of the      mattress 14 foot end. Both the foot protector 17 and the mattress 14 foot      end are convex when viewed from the side, as shown in FIG. 1. The links      19L and 19R are identical and are equal to the half thickness of the foot      protector 17 and the mattress 14. With the links 19L and 19R as radius and      the axle 20 as center line, the foot protector 17 is pivotable for a half      circle about the axle 20 to be positioned at either the top or bottom side      of the mattress 14 foot end, as similarly shown in dotted lines in FIG. 5      which is for another pivotable mechanism embodiment of FIG. 4. The foot      guard is held at each position by a holding unit 21, as shown in FIGS. 1      and 2. </PAR><PAR>  The side view of the holding unit is illustrated individually in FIG. 3. It      comprises a rigid body 21A with one side flat and other side having two      concave wells, and two pairs of matched closure strips 22R, 23R and 22L      and 23L at the mid and top edges respectively (see also FIG. 2). Depending      on the mattress size, e.g. for queen and king sizes, more pairs of closure      strips may be required. The concave wells of the rigid body 21 conform to      the convex ends of the foot protector 17 and the mattress 14 foot end. The      mid closure strips 22R and 22L pass through the gap between the foot      protector 17 and the mattress 14 foot end and wrap upward around the foot      protector 17 while the top closure strips 23R and 23L wrap downwardly. The      matched closure strips meet and hook together that tightly hold the rigid      body 21A against the foot protector 17. With the rigid body 21A in place,      the foot protector 17 will not move when pushed by the feet of a person      because it is blocked by the lower matched concave and convex portions. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 4 and 5 show another embodiment of pivotable connection in which two      links 19AL and 19AR are pivotable in two slots S1 and S2 at one end of a      mattress 14A. Each slot is formed in the mattress end by reinforcement      sheets 24 and 25. Left and right links 19AL and 19AR are pivotable in the      left and right slots respectively with upper terminals connected to a      supporting rod 18A in the foot protector 17A and with lower terminals      pivotably connected to an axle 20A in the mattress 14A foot end. These      four terminal connections are hidden in the foot protector 17A and the      mattress 14A foot end. The foot protector 17A is otherwise the same as the      foot protector 17 of FIGS. 1-3. Both ends of the foot protector 17A and      the mattress 14A foot end are also convex. The two slots are cut through      the convex portion of the mattress 14A foot end down to the axle 20A. Then      the foot protector 17A is pivotable with the links 19AL and 19AR as radius      and with the axle 20A as center line for a half circle travel, as shown in      FIG. 5. The foot protector 17A is also held at its operative position by      same holding unit 21. </PAR><PAR>  The two pivotable foot protector described above in reference to FIGS. 1,      2, 4 and 5 can be detachable and mounted at the mattress head end by      providing spare axles 26 and 26A at the mattress head end as shown in      small dotted circles in FIGS. 1 and 5 respectively. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 6 and 7 show a detachable means of mounting the foot protector on the      mattress foot end. The foot protector 17B and the mattress 14B foot end      have flat edges. Holding sleeves 27L, 27R, 28L, 28R, 29U and 29D are      provided at left, right and rear edges and are aligned in pairs      vertically. Each pair of holding sleeves are connected by inserting a      matched size pin, 30L, 30R and 30M. The rear pin 30M is longer than the      others which extends downwards beyond the mattress 14B next to the box      spring 13. This provides additional resistance against movement of the      foot protector 17B outward. For large size mattress more holding sleeves      and pins are required at the rear edges. When the pins are inserted in the      holding sleeves, the foot protector 17B is held at the up side of the      mattress 14B foot end, and will resist being pushed outward. The foot      protector 17B can be easily detached and reinstalled either at the      opposite side, or at the head end where spare holding sleeves 31L (hidden      from view in FIG. 7), 31R and 32 are provided. </PAR><PAR>  Further, instead of using holding sleeves, holding holes can be provided in      the related members. FIG. 8 shows vertically aligned holes 33 and 34,      indicated by dotted lines, at the inside of foot protector 17C and      mattress 14C foot end respectively. Matched size pin 35 is inserted in the      aligned holes. Additional holes and pins hidden from view in FIG. 8 are      provided along the length of the foot protector 17C and width of the      mattress 14C. The foot protector 17C can be held on the top side of the      mattress 14C foot end, or on lower side, or on the head end where hole 36      is indicated in dotted lines. The holes are located through the spring      coils inside of the mattress 14C and the foot protector 17C for firm      support of the pin 35. </PAR><PAR>  The cylindrical foot protector or foot guard can be in different      cross-sectional shapes, for instance, circular, rectangular,      half-circular-half-rectangular, triangular or trapezoidal. It can be made      of various materials, for instance, mattress like spring, sofa-like      cushion and spring, pneumatic set. Those materials which are soft need a      rigid frame for support; for instance, a half circular rigid shell may be      set at the foot protector outward convex side, not shown. A rigid plate 37      is set at the foot protector 17C outward side, as shown in FIG. 8, as an      example. The rigid plate 37 can also be modified to a right-angle unit at      the foot protector outward and bottom sides, as shown in FIG. 8 in which      plate 37A (shown in dotted lines) extends from plate 37. </PAR><PAR>  The above described closure strips are self-gripping fastener strip or tape      also known as Velcro fastener. The strips come in different sizes, from      narrow to wide, so the number of the strips 22R, 22L, 23R, and 23L also      depend on the strip size. A wide self-gripping fastener tape may be      stronger than three or four narrow tapes. Further, the self-gripping      fastener strip can be replaced by other fasteners, such as button, snaps,      ties, zippers, etc. </PAR><PAR>  The mattress can be water bed type, and the flexible foot protector can be      installed in the water bed foot end either in fixed, or in detachable      configurations as described above. </PAR><PAR>  The flexible foot protector can be equipped with electric heating elements      39 under surface coverings which can be controlled by a thermal control on      the outside. The electric heating system is well known, detail description      and drawing are therefore omitted. In FIG. 8 a thermostat control 38 is      shown on the rigid plate 37. </PAR><PAR>  Further embodiments of the generic concept of the present invention are      illustrated with reference to FIGS. 9 to 23. </PAR><PAR>  In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 9-12, the foot protector 50 is attached to      the mattress 52 by a combination of straps 54 and holding pins 56 and      sleeves 58. More particularly, sleeves 58 are positioned at one end of the      mattress 52 by reinforcement belts 60 tied around the sides of the      mattress. The number of sleeves 58 will depend on the width of the      mattress 52, however at least two sleeves would be required to stabilize      attachment of the foot protector 50. FIG. 12 shows a configuration of      three pins and sleeves for the foot protector 50 which incidently does not      cover the entire width of the mattress. </PAR><PAR>  The foot protector 50 shown has a generally semicircular cross sectional      profile. A rigid angled bracket 62 is attached to the rear and bottom      sides of the foot protector 50. Matching number of pins 56 as the sleeves      58 are screwed into the base of the bracket 62, either near the corner of      the base or at the leading edge of the base (FIG. 10). When the foot      protector 50 is attached to the mattress 52 by inserting the pins 56 into      the sleeves 58, the foot protector 50 would assume either position shown      in FIGS. 9 or 11 depending on the location of attachment of the pins 56 to      the base of the bracket 62. In FIG. 11, the foot protector 50 over-hangs      from the edge of the mattress such that the effective laying surface of      the mattress is maximized. </PAR><PAR>  To resist outward bending motion under pressure from user's feet, the pins      56 are made longer than the thickness of the mattress 52 such that the      pins lean against the box. spring 13. In addition and optionally, one or      more braces such as straps 54 may be provided between the bracket 62 and      an anchor point on the side of the mattress 52 to further secure the foot      protector 50. Specifically, the strap 54 is anchored by providing a hook      which latches on a hole 63 provided on the side of the mattress 52 (see      similar parts in FIG. 17 and the discussion related thereto below). The      strap 54 has a buckle 64 which allows the adjustment of the effective      length of the strap 54 to keep it taut between the hole 63 and the bracket      62. A similar strap 55 may be provided on the other side of the      mattress(FIG. 12). A similar arrangement of sleeves 58A and holes 63A may      be provided at the other end of the mattress to allow for repositioning of      the foot protector when the mattress is turned over. Alternatively, the      strap 60 may be made removable, in which case allowing for repositioning      of the sleeves without having to provide for an additional set of sleeves. </PAR><PAR>  Like the previous embodiments, an electrical heating element 39 may be      provided within the foot protector which is functionally controlled by a      thermostat control 38. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 13 and 14 show a variation of the preceding embodiment. Here,      additional holding sleeves 66 are strapped on the sides of the mattress      68. Two alternate configurations of foot protectors may be used. In a      first configuration, the foot protector 70 is as long as the width of the      mattress 68 and has a bracket 72 similar to that in the preceding      embodiment. Holding pins 74 are however attached to the base of the      bracket 72 near its longitudinal ends for insertion into the sleeves 66 on      the sides of the mattress 68. The foot protector 70 can be positioned at      will at one of many locations along the sides of the mattress as defined      by the sleeves 66, so as to accommodate users of different heights. </PAR><PAR>  In a second configuration, the foot protector 76 has holding sleeves 78 and      79 attached along its back plate bracket 77 and at its two ends. Holding      pins 80 and 81 are inserted through the sleeves 78 and 79 on the foot      protector 76 and the sleeves 58 and 66 on the mattress 68 when attaching      the foot protector to the mattress. The foot protector 76 can be      positioned at the end of the mattress 68 (FIG. 14) or at various locations      along the length of the mattress. The pin 81 is however not used for the      latter locations. A similar set of sleeves 66A may be provided at the      other end of the mattress to increase flexibility of use. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 15 shows a variation of the foot protector in FIG. 14. Instead of      providing sleeves on the foot protector 84, fixedly attached pins 86 are      provided at the two ends of the foot protector 84. Heating element 39 and      thermostat control 38 may be provided. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 16 and 17 show a variation of the embodiment shown in FIG. 9. Holding      pins are omitted in this embodiment. The foot protector 88 is attached to      the mattress using braces or straps 90 only. The straps 90 each has a hook      98 at its end. A series of holes 92 are provided along the sides of the      mattress 94 to define various anchoring locations for the hooks 98. It is      noted that the angle of the strap 90 with respect to the horizon may be      selected based on the understanding that the smaller the angle, the higher      the force the foot protector can withstand against pushing from a user's      feet. The holes 92 may be defined on strips 96 of rigid metal or hard      plastic which are sewn in the sides of the mattress 94 so as to prevent      tearing of the fabric from the pull of the hooks 98. The straps 90 may be      rigid instead of flexible. Similar strips 96A having holes 92A may be      provided at the other end of the mattress. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 18 and 19 show a variation wherein attachment of the foot protector      100 is by using self-gripping straps 102. More particularly, the straps      102 have either surfaces comprising of loops or hooks which can grip on      strips 104 having surfaces comprising of complementary hooks or loops,      respectively, to from a secure attachment to the mattress 106. One example      of the self-gripping fastener material, similar to the closure strips 22      and 23 in FIG. 3, is commercially available under the trademark Velcro.      Strips 104A may be provided at the other end of the mattress. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 20 and 21 show an embodiment which uses a combination of pivotal      attachment and reinforcement straps to attach the guard to the mattress.      Much like the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the foot protector 110 is      pivotably attached to the mattress 111 at hinge holes 112. The specific      example shown in FIGS. 20 and 21 has a pivot 114 which is detachably      attached to the mattress 111 by latching the pivots 114 to the hinge holes      112. Straps 116 are fixedly or detachably attached to the foot protector      bracket 118 for anchoring to holes 115 along the sides of the mattress.      Referring to FIG. 21, the straps 116 are shown to each have a ball joint      117 at the end inserted into the foot protector bracket 118. The foot      protector 110 may be rotated along the dotted line 119 when the mattress      is turned over or when it is desired to move the foot protector out of the      way to obtain a flat mattress surface. In the example shown in FIG. 20,      hook type straps are used. In the alternate, self-gripping fastening      straps may be used. Further, other means of fastening may be used such as      buttons, snaps etc. for anchoring the straps to the sides of the mattress.      Strap holes 115A and hinge holes 112A may be provided at the other end of      the mattress. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 22 and 23 show another embodiment of the present invention in which      the foot protector 120 is made part of a bed sheet or mattress protective      pad 122. The foot protector 120 has a rigid angled bracket 124 for      stabilizing the foot protector 120, and a rounded surface facing the      user's foot. The foot protector 120 in this case is removably inserted      into a duct 126 defined by the fabric of the bed sheet or protective pad.      The foot protector may be removed when laundering of the bed sheet or pad      122 is desired. The foot protector 120 is attached to the mattress 128 by      folding both the foot and head ends of the bed sheet or bed pad 122 and      tucking the ends underneath the foot and head ends of the mattress. Under      the weight of a user on the bed sheet or bed pad 122 and the mattress 128,      the foot protector 120 is prevented from moving from this tucked position.      The exact location of the foot protector 120 on the mattress 128 may be      selected as desired to accommodate users of different height. The foot      protector 120 can be selectively repositioned on the mattress 128 at a      desired location by tucking more or less of the bed sheet or bed pad 122      at the head and foot ends of the mattress. To further secure the foot      protector 120, the bed sheet or bed pad 122 may be attached to the      mattress by any appropriate fasteners such as matched buttons or snaps 129      and 129A. For ease of illustration, the bed sheet or bed pad 122 in FIGS.      22 and 23 is shown to be as wide as the mattress 128. Typically for bed      sheets and some bed pads, they are wider than the mattress. It would be      necessary to fold and tuck the sides of the bed sheet or bed pad      underneath the sides of the mattress. Similar fasteners as fasteners 129      and 129A may be provided to securely attach the bed sheet or bed pad to      the mattress 128. </PAR><PAR>  Like some of the previous embodiments, heating elements 39 and thermostat      control 38 may be provided in the foot protector 120. While some of the      previous embodiments (FIGS. 16-21) do not show heating elements and      thermostat control, it is understood that similar devices may be      implemented in the foot protectors described. </PAR><PAR>  In most cases, the length of mattresses having the foot protector is larger      than standard size mattresses since four or five inches need to be allowed      for the flexible foot protector. </PAR><PAR>  It is understood that the above described embodiments are only for      illustration of the present invention, many other embodiments can be      derived without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
