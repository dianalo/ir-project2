Gold prices also fell as cheaper oil raised the prospect oflower inflation. Gold, traditionally bought as a hedge againstinflation, was quoted at $394 a troy ounce at Republic NationalBank in New York at 4 p.m. EDT, down from $396.50 late Thursday.   Oil futures tumbled after the secretary-general of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Subroto, said crudeprices could plunge to $5 a barrel if Saudi Arabia switches to fullproduction capacity.   Subroto said the Saudis might increase production to convinceOPEC members who violate their export quotas that all producerswould lose if they did not honor their OPEC output ceilings.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price for the near-termcontract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,dropped 55 cents to close at $13.37 a 42-gallon barrel.   Oil futures have been skidding recently because of theoversupply of crude on world markets, so the prospect of fulloutput by the Saudis, the world's largest oil producer, raised thepossibility of a collapse in prices.   ``The low oil prices dominated the market today,'' said RonaldHolzer, chief dealer at Harris Trust andamp; Co. in Chicago.   Oil prices are a barometer of inflation. Lower inflation usuallyleads to lower interest rates, which is a bearish sign for thedollar.   Overseas, dealers also attributed the dollar's slide to commentsabout the U.S. currency by Federal Reserve Board Governor MarthaSeger. She said a sharp rise in the dollar would put the brakes onU.S. economic expansion.   Her comments caught foreign exchange markets by surprise andspurred a dollar selloff late in the European trading day.   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business daybegins, the dollar fell 0.05 yen to a closing 134.30 yen. Later, inLondon, it was quoted at 134.40 yen, and in New York, it slumped to133.75 yen from late Thursday's 134.37.   In London, the dollar dropped against the British pound. It cost$1.6905 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.6825 lateThursday. In New York, the pound climbed to $1.6935 from $1.6810late Thursday.
