The purpose of thestudy described here was to determine the extent to which this 14C wascovalently bound to macromolecules. Male F344/N rats were exposed to360 ng [14C]-1-nitropyrene/l air for 1 h resulting in an average of 2.2micrograms 1-nitropyrene deposited per rat. An additional group of ratswas given 4.2 micrograms [14C]-1-nitropyrene by gavage. Total 14C in23 tissues was determined for up to 96 h after inhalation exposure andup to 30 d after gavage. Lung, liver, and kidney contained the highestconcentrations of 14C. Samples of these tissues were exhaustively extractedto determine the amount of radioactivity covalently bound to macromolecules.Regardless of the route of administration, the kidneys had the highestconcentrations of covalently bound 14C. At 96 h after exposure kidneyshad overall mean concentrations of 2.7 pmol bound/g tissue.microgramsnitropyrene administered. The overall mean concentration in liver was0.18 pmol bound/g.microgram and the overall mean concentration in lungwas 0.06 pmol/g.microgram at 96 h after exposure. Covalently bound materialpersisted in kidneys for the duration of the study (30 d postexposure).The calculated half-time for removal of bound 14C from kidneys was 150d. These data suggest that kidney should be considered as one of theorgans at risk after exposure to nitropyrene by inhalation or ingestion.</TEXT></DOC>
