The cutbacks aren't huge yet, and they may not be entirely voluntary. But separate indications from leading outside trackers of OPEC production show output is coming down, for the moment at least, from the year's peak of 20 million barrels a day reached last month.    &quot;There has been a drop-off,&quot; said Conrad Gerber, president of Petro-Logistics Ltd., a Geneva, Switzerland, consulting firm that watches OPEC's production on a week-to-week basis.    Mr. Gerber figures that OPEC's production in the first half of September has run at 18.8 million barrels a day. For the month, &quot;we are looking at between 18.5 {million} and 19 million barrels a day,&quot; he said.    London-based Petroleum Economics Ltd. puts the 13-nation group's current production rate higher, at around 19.5 million barrels a day. But that still would be 500,000 barrels below recent levels. The surge in output last month trimmed the price of oil by $2 a barrel and brought world oil markets to a stage of near collapse.    With OPEC's leading members calling for new production discipline, evidence of curbs on output would further boost petroleum prices, which rose again yesterday after touching a two-year low Monday. North Sea Brent crude was up 55 cents a barrel on European spot markets, while West Texas Intermediate closed at $14.56 a barrel, up seven cents, on U.S. futures markets.    In addition, several refiners that only Monday reduced the prices they pay for the U.S. benchmark crude by 75 cents a barrel rescinded the cuts yesterday and restored their prices to $14 a barrel.    But Ronald Berke, a vice president of National Cooperative Refinery Association, one of the refiners rescinding the cuts, said the reductions will be reinstated unless OPEC follows through by restricting production. &quot;The (market) fundamentals are extremely weak,&quot; he said.    There were some new signs yesterday that a meeting of the OPEC price-monitoring committee will be held soon to try to encourage member nations to honor their production quotas. A senior OPEC official suggested that an announcement about such a meeting might come as soon as today.    But it wasn't clear whether OPEC's heavyweights are taking action to support their latest efforts to &quot;talk up&quot; weak oil prices -- or whether petroleum refiners have simply slowed their buying because of deteriorating markets and brimming storage tanks.    While there is &quot;some slippage&quot; in OPEC output, &quot;I'm not sure {whether} it's down by design or because a bearish industry doesn't want the oil,&quot; said Edward N. Krapels, president of PEL North America, a Washington-based consulting firm affiliated with Petroleum Economics. But whatever the reason, he said, it means that &quot;for the next month or two, if it keeps up, prices won't crash now.&quot;    The biggest output reductions so far have come in the Persian Gulf region, where much of the excess production had originated. Saudi Arabia, for example, is reported to have produced as much as 4.5 million to five million barrels a day since July, well above its quota of 4.3 million. But Petro-Logistics now measures Saudi production at slightly under 4.4 million barrels a day.    Part of the production decline also has come in Iran, where a combination of a lack of buyers and bad weather has affected loadings. The United Arab Emirates, known as a frequent violator of quotas in the past, reportedly continues to produce at double its OPEC limit.    But whatever cutbacks there may have been, OPEC output still appears to be higher than estimated demand. John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, estimates current demand for OPEC oil at 18.5 million barrels a day. </TEXT></DOC>
