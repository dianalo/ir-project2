People still find it difficult to understand how a stateoverflowing in money, with a presidential nominee for a governor,wound up in a financial hole.   ``This state had six of the most extraordinary years in ourhistory,'' Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said Monday. ``Maybe we began tobelieve it would never change.''   In 1986, as Dukakis told everyone who would listen, Massachusettswas a miracle state, able to pay for new, innovative programs andcut taxes at the same time. The major domestic debate that year wasover what to do with a $348 million budget surlus fueled by abooming state economy.   Three years later Dukakis suffered what he called the most bitterday of his political career _ this coming from a man who lost 40states in the presidential election. Dukakis last Thursday, unableto convince voters to support a tax increase, cut nearly a halfbillion dollars from the state budget.   The $491 million in budget cuts included a $210 million reductionin state aid to cities and towns for such things as schools andpolice, a $97 million cut in human services and $62 million fromeducation.   The explanation Dukakis gives for the state fiscal situation isthat revenue taken in by tax collectors plummeted over the past twoyears and the state has been been taking up the slack left by Reaganadministration budget cuts.   Both are true. Revenue experts can talk for hours about howchanges in the federal tax code, the stock market crash of October1987 and this year's sales tax decline made a mockery of theirrevenue estimates _ the numbers on which state spending is planned.   But critics who hold a more conservative fiscal viewpoint thanDukakis say the governor and the Legislature over the past six yearssimply allowed state spending to rise out of control.   James Howell, chief economist of the Bank of Boston, dismissedthe notion that faulty revenue forecasts led Massachusetts into itscurrent crisis. ``The right question is: if they had been given theright information all along, would they have had the courage to makethe right decisions?''   Partisan critics have blamed the 18-month Dukakis presidentialcampaign for leaving the state without a leader as the financialcrisis developed. Others see roots much deeper.   From 1984 through 1989, state spending increased 67.3 percent, ornearly three times the rate of inflation, according to theMassachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. Personal income during the sameperiod has gone up 51 percent.   Figuring precisely what the Massachusetts public wants has notalways been easy. In one recent newspaper poll, for example, 64percent of those responding opposed an emergency tax increase passedby the Legislature to make up for last year's budget deficit. In thesame poll, 65 percent said they were opposed to Dukakis' budgetspending cuts for this fiscal year.   Some argue that the fiscal conservatives _ those most critical ofDukakis and state spending _ are partially to blame for the currentcrisis.   In 1986, when state revenue was pouring in, Dukakis, under heavypressure from the Legislature and public opinion, repealed a surtaxhe had imposed in his first term. The move cut state revenue by $280million. Other tax cuts which Dukakis eventually supported trimmedrevenue by some $400 million during the past six years. Ironically,those cuts just about equal the shortfall the state is facing.</TEXT></DOC>
