The far-IR data were combined with publisheddata at other wavelengths to complete 93 energy distributions from 10to the 8th to 10 to the 18th Hz. The IRAS data were used to search forvariability on time scales of 3-9 months in 24 objects. The detectionrate of variability found for blazars was nearly 40 percent, as comparedwith a complete absence of detected variability in data sets for quasarsand Seyfert galaxies. The range of variability in both spectral indexand flux density increases with decreasing wavelength. Half of the blazarswith total luminosities less than 10 to the 12th solar luminosity showevidence for thermal IR component. The global energy budget of blazarsis dominated by IR emission from 1 to 100 microns. 56 references.</TEXT></DOC>
