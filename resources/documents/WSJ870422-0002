SchmittStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WNEWS SPCDIVIDENDS (DIV) </IN><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Several years ago, when he was in charge of the bank's trust department, Robert H. Smith took the then-unheard-of step of leading Security Pacific Corp. into the securities business.    Yesterday, Mr. Smith, 51 years old, was named president and chief executive officer of Security Pacific National Bank, the company's main subsidiary. The promotion didn't surprise employees of one of the nation's largest banking concerns because Mr. Smith has long been considered the heir apparent to Richard J. Flamson III, the parent company's chairman and chief executive.    But Mr. Smith may well have a few surprises in store. In an interview, he discussed a bold plan for boosting profits of the bank, which has the second-largest branch system in California, after BankAmerica Corp. The plan includes cutting costs -- and apparently staff -- as well as motivating employees with higher pay but stricter accountability.    Mr. Smith also thinks the bank can simultaneously achieve greater profits and improved service, and, according to one associate, has toyed with the idea of doing television ads himself, although Security Pacific has shunned such &quot;image&quot; advertising during its 116-year history.    &quot;Bob is sort of a maverick,&quot; said John Singleton, a Security Pacific vice chairman.    In a bank that aims to earn about half its net income from non-traditional sources, the maverick label says a lot.    Moreover, next week, when he begins laying out his plans for the bank's branch managers, Mr. Smith may find some resistance. He wants branch employees to more aggressively sell a wider variety of services, but many banks have had trouble turning their workers into effective salespersons. Security Pacific also has long stressed individual decision-making, but Mr. Smith wants more standardization, including standards of service.    &quot;I think it's a shift, certainly in expectations,&quot; he said of his plans, but &quot;consistency and performance outweigh autonomy,&quot; which can lead to customers being treated poorly.    The native southern Californian, who has a law degree, formerly was chief operating officer of the bank unit. He will retain his position as vice chairman of the bank unit and the parent. Lately, he has been responsible for capital markets activities, also playing a major role in Security Pacific's interstate banking strategy, which has been viewed warily by some analysts and investors.    Last month, he negotiated the company's agreement to acquire Seattle-based Rainier Bancorp for $1.1 billion. Some analysts have criticized the transaction as too costly. But the bank defends it as integral to its goal of becoming the West's leading financial institution, in anticipation of an onslaught of new Eastern competitors when state laws allow them in starting in 1991.    Mr. Smith said he believes the bank's retail operation, which includes the large California branch system, has a &quot;good shot&quot; at boosting its profitability, based on return on assets, to 1% next year, compared with an estimated 0.87% in 1986. Running his finger down a hand-written list of other regional banks that are currently more profitable, he says, &quot;I can't stand the fact that they are better than I am.&quot;    Mr. Smith said he believes the bank can &quot;substantially&quot; boost the amount of loans and other business it generates in its branches, aided by new technology as well as higher rewards but swifter justice for employees. Moreover, he said, &quot;we think that we can do it at a substantially reduced cost.&quot; Costs have actually risen about 5% annually in recent years.    Mr. Smith declined to say whether he would reduce staff, but said the retail bank's current work force of 10,000 has peaked. He said the bank doesn't plan to close a large number of its branches, as some cost-cutting California banks have done in recent years, but he said 3% to 4% of the company's roughly 600 branches in the state were &quot;consolidation&quot; candidates.    Mr. Smith said the company will soon introduce computer equipment to enable account officers to process loan applications &quot;in hours rather than days.&quot; He said the bank is gradually centralizing customer credit reviews to give branch employees more time to sell its services. He also plans to require senior officers to start personally calling on business prospects, and is considering keeping some branches open after regular hours or on weekends.    The push in the branches to make more loans is central to Security Pacific because it is drawing an increasing share of its overall profits from selling off its loans to investors. In the past six months, the company has sold $1.3 billion of securities backed by mortgages it originated. Profit from those sales was a major reason the company was able to report a 12.2% increase in net income for the first quarter, even as the Latin American debt crisis caused lower profits at other big banks.    Reflecting those results, Security Pacific also raised its quarterly dividend by 22% yesterday, marking the 11th straight year of dividend increases.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Security Pacific common shares closed at $35.50, up 25 cents.    Mr. Smith succeeds George F. Moody, 56, who remains the parent's president and chief operating officer and who is overseeing a new group charged with paring redundant operations among the California unit and new banks in the Pacific Northwest and Arizona.    He will be assisted by Mr. Singleton, chief executive of the company's automation unit, who was given the additional title of vice chairman for the parent yesterday. John Kooken, the chief financial officer, also was named a vice chairman.    In addition, at the main bank unit, David R. Lovejoy, executive vice president in charge of merchant banking, was named a vice chairman in charge of all capital markets operations, and George H. Benter Jr., formerly executive vice president and chief credit officer, was named vice chairman for business banking, including middle-market and commercial real estate lending. Robert C. Corteway, an executive vice president, was named to succeed Mr. Benter as chief credit officer; he previously was in charge of the bank's problem assets.    The promotions were announced at the company's annual meeting. </TEXT></DOC>
