Already this year, public sales of stock and convertiblenotes by biotechnology companies total more than $1.2billion, according to Ernst andamp; Young, the accounting concern,which tracks such sales. The 1991 financings already top the$777 million raised in 1989 and 1990 combined. And biotechcompanies aim this year to raise hundreds of millions more.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is the biggest boom for the industry yet,&quot; says G.Steven Burrill, who tracks high-technology companies from theSan Francisco office of Ernst andamp; Young.   Besides helping biotechnology companies that are alreadypublicly traded, the boom is enabling others to go public ata time that demand for initial public offerings generally isstill lukewarm. Overall IPOs (excluding offerings byclosed-end investment funds) totaled $1.53 billion in thefirst quarter, up sharply from $185.6 million a quarterearlier, but below the levels of recent first quarters, saysIDD Information Services, New York. But financiers andanalysts say the market for biotech issues, including IPOs,has never been stronger.   Favorable investor response to the biotech offerings endsa long dry spell for the cash-hungry companies and greatlyenhances their prospects of conducting fruitful research, aswell as of remaining independent along the way. Mostbiotechnology companies have no marketable products yet, andthus can't finance themselves through operations.   In Wall Street parlance, a market &quot;window&quot; for sellingbiotechnology stock has opened wide, for the first time since1986. Joseph McGuirl, senior vice president of HealthCareInvestment Corp., an Edison, N.J., venture-capital company,says, &quot;Many of the companies rushing to market have waited aslong as three years for the financing window to reopen.&quot;   One factor behind the renewed public support forbiotechnology financings is the sharp rise in sales for a fewbiotechnology companies with actual products, such as AmgenInc. and Biogen Inc. In addition, government approvals ofseveral new drugs signal further success for some companies.The recent run-up in leading biotech stocks, especiallyAmgen's and Centocor Corp.'s, has heartened investors and, insome cases, provided the capital for investments in newbiotech offerings.   &quot;There's broadening recognition of the tremendous impactthat these small companies are having in drug discovery anddevelopment,&quot; says David S. Webber, a biotechnology analystin New York for Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc., a Baltimoresecurities company. Biotech companies use genetic engineeringto make novel drugs based on substances produced naturally bythe human body. Amgen's Epogen, for example, stimulates theproduction of red blood cells, thus providing the firsteffective treatment for severe anemias.   But the entrepreneurs are passing along considerable risksto the investing public, and it is unclear how long investorswill keep the financing window open. Biotechnology stockdoesn't come cheap. Some companies with products and profitsfive to 10 years away -- if they ever emerge -- are beingvalued at more than $300 million. And in some cases,investors are already having second thoughts.   This month public investors paid $99 million for a$22-a-share public stock offering by RegeneronPharmaceuticals Inc., a Tarrytown, N.Y., developer ofbiotechnology-based compounds to treat nerve disorders. Butthe market couldn't sustain the price for even a week. Innational over-the-counter trading, the stock closed yesterdayat $16.125 a share, unchanged. James McCamant, editor ofMedical Technology Stock Letter, a newsletter based inBerkeley, Calif., says the underwriters -- led by MerrillLynch andamp; Co. -- unwittingly &quot;made it a lot harder to sell thenext deal.&quot; Mr. McCamant and others fear that once burned,investors will be twice shy on the new biotech offerings.   &quot;It's good for the company,&quot; Mr. McCamant says of theresult of Regeneron's offering. &quot;But it's bad for MerrillLynch, it's bad for the investors that bought Regeneron, andit's bad for the other companies planning offerings.&quot; MerrillLynch declined to comment. Mr. Webber, the Alex. Brownanalyst, says the Regeneron example &quot;might suggest to newerinvestors that investing in biotechnology is just asirrational as it has ever been.&quot; Such thinking would bemistaken, given that the industry is more mature than adecade ago, the analyst adds.   More mature or not, the industry has new entrants who arefar from seeing a developed product, much less a profit.Regeneron, which has accumulated a deficit of nearly $7million since its inception in 1988, says it &quot;expects toincur substantial operating losses over at least the nextseveral years.&quot; The company says purchases of its shares&quot;shouldn't be made by any investor who can't afford the lossof his entire investment.&quot;   Four-year-old Cephalon Inc. is planning to raise $39million to $44 million in a stock offering. The West Chester,Pa., company is developing treatments for neurogenerativediseases, such as Alzheimer's and ALS, commonly known as LouGehrig's disease. But &quot;none of the company's compounds havebeen approved for clinical testing in humans and no revenuehas been generated from product sales,&quot; the company says.   No more advanced is Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc., ofCarlsbad, Calif., which has announced plans to raise between$39 million and $45 million by selling shares. Thetwo-year-old company -- which is &quot;at a very early stage ofdevelopment,&quot; according to its prospectus -- is exploringways to combat herpes, papilloma and human immunodeficiencyvirus, among other targets.   Many such companies are being urged to go public by theirventure-capital backers, says Mr. Burrill of Ernst andamp; Young.With new venture-capital funds getting harder to raise, &quot;manyventure capitalists are hoping that this market window willmake them liquid,&quot; he explains.   In any case, it normally doesn't take much urging:Biotechnology companies have learned that it takes massiveamounts of capital to successfully produce and market drugs.&quot;In our kinds of companies, money-raising is an ongoing,perpetual event that we all have to put into our plans,&quot; saysDavid Hale, chief executive officer of Gensia PharmaceuticalsInc., a San Diego biotechnology concern. Mr. Hale, who alsoco-founded Hybritech Inc., says that the $64 million thatGensia has raised since it went public in June 1990 --including $36 million raised this month -- has helped itacquire a manufacturing facility and some marketableproducts.   More money also will enable some entrepreneurial companiesto maintain their independence, even if they enter intostrategic alliances with large pharmaceutical companies, saysKevin Kinsella, managing general partner of Avalon Ventures,a La Jolla, Calif., venture-capital company. &quot;More money willallow the companies to reach a plateau of scientificaccomplishment which is attractive to a corporate partner,&quot;he says. &quot;At that level, a small company can call its ownshots.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
