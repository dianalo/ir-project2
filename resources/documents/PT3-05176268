The yoke includes first and second yoke      members extending longitudinally. An interlocking coupler member including      a head portion and a shank portion is mounted with the yoke. A connector      assembly holds the interlocking coupler member in position in the yoke.      The interlocking coupler member includes a rear butt portion positioned      internally of the connector assembly for engaging a follower block mounted      substantially between the first and second yoke members. A resilient      member is mounted between the follower block assembly and the end of the      yoke. The follower block assembly includes a central section located      between the yoke members and further includes first and second guide      portions which are joined to a central follower block section and extend      outwardly to hold the follower block in position in spite of the      application of external forces. A yoke positioner assembly is mounted with      the draft sill section to maintain the yoke in a substantially      longitudinal position in spite of the application of stresses through the      interlocking coupler member and yoke. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates to draft gear assemblies for railroad cars and      includes apparatus for maintaining the position of the follower block and      additional apparatus for maintaining the longitudinal position of the yoke      under the stresses of actual use. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Typical railroad cars used for load carrying operations such as hopper cars      include a center sill structure which has been used in the railroad      industry for many decades. The center sill structure in a railroad car      includes a generally longitudinal central beam which provides the      principle structural support for the entire underframe of the hopper car      and allows for the transmission of the forces of draft (pulling) and buff      (pushing) through a series of hopper cars. The center sill sections of      such railroad cars terminate at each end in draft center sill sections.      Some types of gondola cars utilize draft center sill sections without the      central or through member center sill. </PAR><PAR>  In any car using a draft center sill, a yoke is mounted in the draft center      sill section and includes a cast yoke member having upper and lower yoke      members and an internal end portion in order to form a longitudinal pocket      or recess. Such yokes are well known in the industry, and have been      standardized by the American Association of Railroads (AAR). Also      standardized by the AAR are couplers which are mounted partially within      the yoke and extend outwardly from the railroad car to couple to another      railroad car. Typically, these couplers include a coupling head and a      shank portion. The shank portion is connected by a pin or key to the yoke,      which pin extends through an end portion of the shank of the coupler to      mount the coupler for pivotal movement with respect to the yoke. The      portion of the shank positioned internally of the connecting pin is known      as the rear butt portion of the coupler. It is known and recommended by      the AAR that a follower block be mounted between the upper and lower yoke      members internally of the coupler rear butt portion to engage the rear      butt portion. The follower block is mounted in this longitudinal recess      between the upper and lower yoke members and serves to confine any type of      resilient or spring mechanism which is positioned between the internal end      of the yoke member and the follower block. In this manner, in response to      draft and buff forces, particularly buff forces, the forces exerted      against the coupler which are transmitted through the connecting pin and      rear butt section to the follower block are evenly transmitted to the      resilient mechanism or spring and thereby cushioned. </PAR><PAR>  One of the problems with known follower block is that such follower blocks      are rather loosely mounted within this pocket or recess between the upper      and lower yoke members, and are only confined by side members of the draft      sill structure. This confinement has proved to be inadequate under certain      stress conditions where, in response to extreme stresses or to repeated      stresses, the follower block may be pushed out of position. If the      follower block is pushed out of position, the efficiency of the shock      absorbent or resilient means located in the yoke recess is substantially      diminished. This dislocation of follower blocks is a known problem which      causes maintenance to railroad cars. </PAR><PAR>  Another known problem relating to the draft gear assembly is that the yoke      members themselves are pushed sideways or transversely from their      longitudinal positions as a result of the same stresses applied to the      coupler, which transmit through the connecting pin to the yoke. Transverse      displacement of the yoke members, which are also only held in position by      a part of the draft sill structure, can enhance dislocation of the      follower block and can cause the yoke members to lose their longitudinal      alignment which also reduces the efficiency of the cushioning mechanism      located in the yoke member and can cause an entire structural      deterioration of the yoke member itself due to wear of an out-of-position      yoke member against the draft sill structure. </PAR><PAR>  Insofar as known, these problems have not been adequately dealt with in      prior draft gear assemblies. A review of certain known patents also shows      that little effort has been made to solve these draft system assembly wear      problems. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 1,947,936 of Glascodine discloses a central buffing and draft      gear wherein liner plates are mounted against the side members of the      center sill for purpose of absorbing lateral stress from the yoke. Such      efforts to absorb the lateral stresses of the yoke member, as disclosed in      the Glascodine patent, do not attempt to confine the position of the yoke      member against the external forces of coupler movement. The Glascodine      patent further discloses the use of front and rear follower plates which      are mounted within the yoke member and extend outwardly to the side sill      structure. Each of the follower plates include flange portions extending      peripherally in order to provide enlarged bearing surfaces in contact with      the side, liner plates which absorb shocks and prevent tendency of the      follower plates to rock under stress. Thus, these peripheral flanges do      not actually engage the yoke members themselves, but rather engage the      side members of the side sill structure. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 3,599,818 of Knippel et al. discloses the use of projecting      portions on a rear wall member which also engages a resilient mechanism      within the center sill. The projecting portions in Knippel are for the      purpose of confining a spring part of the resilient mechanism and mounting      additional external absorbing elements, and do not engage or maintain the      rear block in position with respect to a yoke. </PAR><PAR>  Other patents generally disclosing follower blocks include U.S. Pat. No.      4,593,827 of Altherr which discloses a generally rectangular follower      block which engages the rear butt portion of a draw bar and is held in      position within a pocket casting. U.S. Pat. No. 2,386,476 of Kinne et al.      also discloses a follower block mounted within the pocket of a casting.      U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,531,648 of Paton; 3,716,146 of Altherr; and 4,480,758 of      Hurt disclose various embodiments of follower blocks. U.S. Pat. No.      4,311,765 of Chung discloses a polyurethane shock absorbing unit to be      used inside a draft gear as a primary shock absorbing medium within the      gear. </PAR><PAR>  In summary, there is no known solution for the problem of migration of the      draft gear follower block and the wear problems associated with transverse      or sideways movement of the yoke itself in response to the external      stresses placed upon the coupling element. The result of these stresses is      that the follower blocks lose position potentially causing undue wear.      There is additional undue wear that can be caused by the yoke being moved      out of position or being subjected to transverse agitation. The only known      way to repair these problems is to take a railroad hopper car out of      commission, replace the parts and/or building up through weld the effected      wear areas, all of which is extremely time-consuming and expensive. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates to an improved draft gear assembly intended to have      a longer life than draft gear assemblies by reducing wear and maintaining      alignment within the structure of the draft gear assembly. The improved      draft gear assembly of this invention includes a center sill structure      terminating a one end in a draft center sill section having a yoke mounted      therewith. An interlocking coupler member is mounted by a connector      assembly to the yoke. A follower block assembly is mounted within the      structure of a yoke behind the butt end portion of the interlocking      coupler member for purposes of transmitting forces exerted against the      coupler against a resilient or cushioning mechanism mounted within the      yoke behind the follower block assembly. The follower block includes a      central section mounted within the yoke and first and second extending      guide portions joined to the central follower block section and extending      outwardly of the yoke into engagement with a yoke for maintaining the      position the follower block even under the stress of external forces.      Additionally, the improved draft gear assembly may include yoke positioner      assembly mounted onto the draft sill structure on opposite sides of the      yoke for purposes of maintaining the longitudinal position of the yoke      even under the influence of external forces applied through the coupler      member. This Summary Of The Invention is not intended to set forth all of      the patentable aspects of applicant's invention as described in detail in      the following description of the preferred embodiment. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a top view partially in section of the improved draft gear      assembly of this invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a side view partially in section of the improved draft gear      assembly of FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the yoke positioner mechanism for      maintaining the yoke in a longitudinal position; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a perspective view of the follower block of this invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a perspective view of a wear insert for the follower block of      this invention; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a perspective view of another version of the wear insert of FIG.      5. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  Referring to the drawings, the letter R is directed to the improved draft      gear assembly for a railroad car of the preferred embodiment of this      invention. Such a railroad car typically includes a center sill as is      known in the American railroad industry. Such center sill structure is      generally designated by the number 10 in FIG. 1. Such a center sill      structure typically includes a central frame member which extends      longitudinally the length of a railroad car and is provided for the      purpose of being the central frame support for the railroad car. Further,      such a center sill assembly as is known in the railroad industry provides      for the transmission of draft (pulling) and buff (pushing) forces that are      directed against the railroad car. </PAR><PAR>  The center sill structure 10 includes a draft center sill section 11 which      is particularly illustrated in FIG. 1. The draft center sill section 11      includes opposing side members 11a and 11b which terminate in bottom ledge      members 12a and 12b. Mounted on ledge members 12a and 12b are the      laterally extending yoke straps 14 and 15. The laterally extending yoke      straps 14 and 15 are each rectangular plates which are spaced somewhat      apart and are attached to the draft sill section ledges 12a and 12b by a      series of bolts or rivets such as 14a and 15a (FIG. 2). </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 2, the draft center sill section 11 further includes a      top plate member 11c which cooperates with the side sill members 11a and      11b and the bottom yoke straps 14 and 15 to form a generally rectangular      compartment identified by the number 16. A casting known as a striking      casting 17 is mounted on the bottom of the top draft center sill structure      plate 11c and extends outwardly therefrom. </PAR><PAR>  A yoke member generally designated by the number 20 is mounted within      compartment 16 of draft center sill structure 11. The yoke member 20,      which is viewed principally from the top, partly in section in FIG. 1, is      viewed from the side and partly in section in FIG. 2 and in perspective in      FIG. 3. The structure of illustrated yoke member 20 is well known in the      railroad industry. Such yoke member is disclosed in the Association of      American Railroads, Mechanical Division, Manual of Standards and      Recommended Practices under the title &quot;AAR Standard E/F and F Yokes,&quot;      effective Feb. 1, 1973. The yoke 20 is formed by casting and includes an      upper yoke member 20a, a lower yoke member 20b and an internal end member      20c. Each of the upper and lower yoke members 20a and 20b are generally      rectangular in configuration and are mounted to extend longitudinally      along the longitudinal axis 21 of the draft center sill 11 and thus of the      railroad car itself. The upper yoke member 20a terminates at its outer end      in an enlarged portion 20d having opening 20e machined therein. Similarly,      the lower yoke member 20b terminates at its outer end in an enlarged      portion 20f and also includes an opening 20g in alignment with opening      20e. Front side supporting portions 20h and 20i are cast with the entire      yoke member 20 thereby providing substantial support to the yoke as a      whole. A generally rectangular recess or pocket identified as 22 is formed      by the yoke members 20a and 20b. </PAR><PAR>  As previously described, the upper yoke member 20a is generally rectangular      and thus includes parallel side edges 23a and 23b which extend outwardly      by means of the outwardly tapered or flared edges 23c and 23d to form the      enlarged portion 20d through straight side edges portions 23e and 23f.      Similarly, the lower yoke member includes straight edge sections 24a and      24b. </PAR><PAR>  A coupler member generally designated as 30 is also well known in the      industry. The coupler member 30 is a standard coupler member of the      Association of American Railroads and is identified in the Manual of      Standards and Recommended Practices under the title &quot;AAR Standard F      Couplers,&quot; effective Jan. 1, 1977. The coupler member 30 includes a      coupler head 30a adapted to engage a complementary coupler on another      railroad car. The coupler head 30a is formed with a longitudinally      extending, generally rectangularly tubular coupler shank or shaft 30b. The      coupler shank 30b includes an opening 30c and an internal butt end portion      30d which terminates in a generally round, spherical end portion 30e. </PAR><PAR>  A connector assembly includes a cylindrical pin 40 mounted in the opening      20e in the upper yoke member 20a and in the opening 20g in the lower yoke      member 20b. The pin is held in position by the generally U-shaped      connector pin support bracket 41 illustrated in FIG. 2, which is bolted to      the bottom surface of the lower yoke member 20b. The pin 40 thus mounts      the coupler member 30 in the pocket 22 of the yoke 20. The coupler head 30      is attached to a suitable coupler on the adjacent railroad car. Stresses      are applied to the coupler member 30 during pushing, pulling and turning      of the railroad cars around curves. These forces of tension, compression,      and twisting or torque as applied to the coupler head 30a are transmitted      through the coupler shank 30b to the pin 40. The pin 40 transmits the      forces to the upper and lower yoke members 20a and 20b, which in turn      transmit these forces to the mounting areas where the yoke members 20a and      20b are attached to the draft center sill structure 11. Transmission of      these externally applied forces can place great stress upon the yoke      members 20a and 20b and can cause wear between the yoke members 20a and      20b and the draft side sill structure 11 itself. These stresses can      actually move the yoke members 20a and 20b out of the initial longitudinal      alignment along the longitudinal axis 21. </PAR><PAR>  Forces are also transmitted through the coupler shank 30b to the butt end      portion 30e of the coupler shank, particularly during buff and twisting or      turning of the entire coupler. As discussed in the Background of the      Invention, it is known to use a generally rectangular follower block. The      follower block disclosed in this invention and generally identified by the      number 50 is of a unique construction and configuration. The follower      block 50 is shown in a perspective view in FIG. 4, in a top view partly in      section in FIG. 1, and in a side view partly in section in FIG. 2. The      follower block includes a generally central rectangular portion 50a. The      front face of the rectangular portion has an approximately dome-shaped      recessed area 50b formed therein for purposes of receiving the generally      convex or dome-shaped end surface of the butt end section 30e of the      coupler 30. This recessed area 50b in the central portion of the front      face of the follower block is optional and may be circular as illustrated      or of other configuration. The follower block 50 is positioned in the      pocket of the upper and lower yoke members 20a and 20b to house a shock      cushioning or resilient means generally designated as 52. In the      embodiment illustrated, the resilient means 52 is a spring. It should be      understood that any other type of cushioning element, series of elements,      or cushioning mechanism as is known in the art may be utilized. </PAR><PAR>  The follower block 50 is provided to transmit these external forces applied      through butt and 30e to the spring or other cushioning member 52 to      somewhat cushion the stresses that are applied through the coupling member      such as during stopping or turning of the railroad car. The follower block      50 of this invention further includes first and second guide portions 54      and 55 formed integrally with the central follower block section 50a to      extend upwardly and downwardly, respectively, outside of the yoke pocket      22 of maintaining the follower block 50 in position. The upper guide      portion 54 includes guide posts or tab sections 54a and 54b which extend      upwardly from each upper corner of the central follower block section 50a. </PAR><PAR>  The guide posts 54a and 54b cooperate with a central flat rectangular      intermediate face 50c to form a generally U-shaped configuration to fit      under and on each side of the upper yoke member 20a. A generally U-shaped      wear insert 60 as illustrated in FIG. 5 is mounted onto the guide posts      54a and 54b and extend therebetween on the upper surface 50c in order to      provide a wear surface for engagement against the side edges 23d and 23f      and 23c and 23e, respectively, on the upper yoke member 20a. It is      anticipated that the follower block of this invention will be made of      metal such as a steel. The purpose of the wear insert 60 is to avoid      having the metal portions of the upwardly extending guide posts 54a and      54b actually be in contact with the side edges such as 23d and 23f of the      upper yoke member, which could cause galling and other undue wear or      damage to either the yoke member or the guide post. It is contemplated      that the wear insert 60 will be made of a polyurethane or other suitably      hard and rugged non-metallic material. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 5, the wear insert 60 is generally U-shaped and includes      a first post member 60a and a second post members 60b which are joined by      an intermediate generally rectangular connecting portion 60c. The post      members 60a and 60b include groove portions 60d and 60e, respectively,      which slide into complementary groove portions in the follower block guide      posts 54a and 54b. Further connections, such as pins 61, are mounted in      the intermediate insert section 60c and extend into corresponding holes in      the top surface 50c of the follower block 50. The inside face of each      guide post 60a and 60b is identified by the numbers 60f and 60g. The faces      60f and 60g are generally convex. </PAR><PAR>  A similar wear insert 65 (FIG. 4) is mounted onto the guidepost 55a and 55b      which are also formed integrally with the central portion 50a of the      follower block but extend downwardly around the bottom yoke member 20b.      The structure of the follower blocks 55a and 55b is identical of that of      the follower blocks 54a and 54b, and thus includes internal grooves which      mate with the grooves 60d and 60e of the wear insert posts follower tabs      60a and 60 b. </PAR><PAR>  As an alternative to the use of the generally U-shaped wear insert of FIG.      5, individual guide post inserts such as illustrated in FIG. 6 may be      utilized. Referring to FIG. 6, the wear insert 70 is provided to be      mounted on to a guide post such as guide post 54a. The insert 70 is of the      same structure as the guide post portions such as 60a and 60b of the wear      insert 60 of FIG. 5. Grooved portions 70a are provided to allow the wear      insert member 70 to be inserted on to the guide post 54a. A generally      convex wear surface 70b is provided to engage against the side edges of      the upper and lower yoke members 20a and 20b. </PAR><PAR>  In operation and use, the follower block 50 is placed in position with its      front surface in engagement against the rear butt section 30e of the      coupler shank 30b. The guide posts 54a, 54b extend upwardly, out of the      yoke pocket 22 and on the outside of each side of the yoke member 20a. The      inside, convex surfaces 60f and 60g of the wear insert 60 are immediately      adjacent to and engage the side edges such as 23d and 23f of the upper      yoke member 20a in response to stresses applied through butt coupler      section butt end 30e. The guide posts 54a and the wear insert surfaces 60f      and 60g thus engage the edges of the yoke member 20a thereby holding the      follower block assembly 50 in a substantially transverse position to the      longitudinal axis 21 so that the rear surface 50d of the follower block      assembly squarely meets the cushioning mechanism 52a in order to cushion      the shock of impact forces and twisting forces transmitted through the      coupler 30 to the yoke members 20a and 20b. </PAR><PAR>  The transmission of these external forces through the coupler 30 to the      yoke members 20a and 20b can cause the yoke member to move out of      position. To avoid this, this invention includes side guide or yoke      positioner assemblies generally designated as 80 in FIG. 3. The yoke      positioner assemblies include first and second flange members 81 and 82      mounted onto the yoke strap plate 15 and flange members 83 and 84 mounted      onto the yoke strap or wear plate 14. Each of the yoke positioner members      81-84 are identical in structure and thus only one will be described. The      first flange member 81 includes an L-shaped metal bracket which may be      welded or otherwise attached to the yoke wear plate or strap 15. The      L-shaped bracket includes an upwardly extending flange portion 81a which      may engage the edge 24b of the lower yoke member directly. In the      alternative, and as a further improvement, a wear pad 81b is attached to      the inside face of the flange portion 81a. The wear pad may also be      polyurethane or other non-metallic wear materials of the same type as used      for the wear insert 60 of FIG. 5. The wear pad 81 may be held in place by      any suitable means and is adapted to engage the side edge 24b of the lower      yoke member 20b to resist movement of the yoke member 20b out of its      longitudinally aligned position as illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 3. </PAR><PAR>  The combination of the four guide members 81-84 mounted on the yoke wear      plates or straps 14 and 15 serve to maintain the lower yoke member 20b and      thus the entire yoke 20 in a generally longitudinal position and to      prevent detrimental movement of the yoke member into positions which may      cause wear or other damage to the other portions of the draft cell      structure 11. </PAR><PAR>  In summary, the combination of the improved follower block assembly 50 and      the yoke position assemblies 80 serve to hold the follower block 50 in a      transverse position to improve cushioning and prevent the follower block      from losing its shock receiving position. Further, the side guide      assemblies 80 serve to hold the yoke member in a generally longitudinal      position in order to avoid undesirable movement and thus possible damage      to the yoke member or the surrounding draft cell structure. </PAR><PAR>  Having described the invention above, various modifications of the      techniques, procedures, material and equipment will be apparent to those      in the art. It is intended that all such variations within the scope and      spirit of the appended claims be embraced thereby. For example, the      principles of this invention apply to other types of railroad cars      including but not limited to gondolas, flat cars or any railroad car      utilizing a draft system assembly; and, as used in the claims, the term      &quot;railroad car&quot; applies to all such cars. Further, this invention car can      be practiced on &quot;E&quot; type coupler yoke designs as well as &quot;F&quot; types or      other type of coupler systems wherein the follower block can utilize the      stabilization principles of this invention. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
