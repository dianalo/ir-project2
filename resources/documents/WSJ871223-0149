State-owned BNP said that narrowing loan margins and a decline in commission revenue eroded the benefits of greater deposit volumes, and that net banking income increased only slightly in the third quarter. That wasn't sufficient to compensate for a rise in general operating expenditures and depreciation costs, it added.    In the the first nine months, gross operating earnings declined 6% from a year earlier. In 1986, gross operating earnings rose 14% from the year before, to slightly more than 10 billion francs.    A fourth-quarter improvement isn't expected, largely because of the dollar's decline and the world stock-market collapse, BNP said.    BNP is among the groups slated for privatization by the French government. But the denationalization program has been halted because of the market crash, and market observers say it's unlikely that BNP will be sold before next spring's presidential election. </TEXT></DOC>
