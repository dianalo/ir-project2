Some radionuclides are tracers for indispensablenutrients and have been isotopically bound to and even assimilated inthe biosphere. To these radionuclides belong all the isotopes of macro-and micronutrients necessary for the normal functioning of live. A ratherimpressive amount of radionuclides, however, do not belong to this categorysuch as e.g. U, Am, Np, Tc, Cs, Rb, etc. Screening the literature backto 1972 a few remarkable facts were elicited concerning the fate of radionuclidesin the biosphere. Tritium has well been investigated in animals but lesswell in plants; carbon-14 metabolism is well-known in plants for obviousreasons; strontium-90 and caesium-137 for many years have been used totrace calcium and potassium; iron-59, zinc-65, manganese-54 and cobalt-60are favorites in the studies on micronutrients in plants and animals.Speciation of actinides in plants is rather tough, particularly due totheir scarce uptake by plants. Elements like technetium on the otherhand are readily accumulating in plants which led to an outburst of interestin its speciation. Careful examination by chromatography reveals indeedthe existence of a large number of Tc-bio-organic molecules with likewisea broad range of molecular masses and chemical features. Technetium isdiscussed therefore in more detail.</TEXT></DOC>
