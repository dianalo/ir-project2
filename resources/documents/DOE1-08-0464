Of the 719 probabilitysample lakes, only one was acidic; 99% of the lakes were estimated tohave pHandgt;6.0. However, acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) was andless; or = 50microeq L-1 for an estimated 16.8% of the lakes in the study area. Ofthe five subregions in the West, California had the highest proportionof lakes with ANC andless; or = 50 microeq L-1 (36.7%) and the Southern RockyMountains had the lowest proportion (4.6%). The lakes in the West werepost-stratified into geomorphic units corresponding to major mountainranges. Watershed factors, including watershed area, lake area, watershedarea: lake area ratio, lake depth, watershed slope, percent exposed bedrock,elevation, and hydraulic residence time, were examined within six geomorphicunits in order to evaluate their relationship to lake ANC. These watershedvariables had poor predictive capability with respect to ANC. The resultssuggest that higher-resolution information for factors such as mineralogyand hydrology are required for prediction of lake ANC within a givengeomorphic unit.</TEXT></DOC>
