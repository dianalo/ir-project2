The officials ``are very, very sure of their case,'' Re. BarbaraBoxer, D-Calif., said after Rear Adm. Ted Gordon met with membersof the House Armed Services Committee.   ``It's pretty iron-clad,'' she said, adding that she expects``many indictments.''   Rep. Larry Hopkins, R-Ky., said, ``many, many indictments willbe forthcoming.... I don't think it will be too long before thefirst of them will be coming down.''   Hopkins cautioned that ``this case has a long, long way to go.But when it's finished, people are going to go to jail.''   Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., sounded an even morecautious note, saying, ``The information collected so far is notmuch of an investigation. It's been more like aninformation-gathering process. From now on, with the subpoenas, thesearch warrants, the investigation is just beginning.''   The real test of the system, said Aspin, ``is how manyindictments there are.''   Under investigation are allegations that defense contractors andconsultants, many of them former military men, bribed Pentagonofficials for contracting details that could be vital in winningcontracts worth billions of dollars.   Aspin's call Wednesday for Defense Secretary Frank C. Carluccito order ``absolutely no contracts signed for 60 days (or) sixweeks'' with companies implicated in the criminal investigation wasrejected Thursday by the Pentagon.   ``We would be glad to discuss with the Congress the question offreezing awards of new contracts while the Justice Department isinvestigating allegations of procurement fraud,'' said Pentagonspokesman Fred S. Hoffman. ``But at this point we feel it would beimprudent to apply such a freeze or moratorium.''   If the Pentagon froze new contracts, ``the innocent would sufferas well as the guilty.... You may be sure that we will takeprecautions in any awards,'' Hoffman said.   Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported in Friday's editionsthat a company headed by two representatives of defense contractorsintervened in a foreclosure case to relieve Rep. Bill Chappell,D-Fla., and his companies of $266,322 in unpaid debts related to afailed health club in Florida.   The intervention by Racquet Club of Ocala Inc. canceledChappell's and his partner's personal liability for a large part oftheir indebtedness and removed them from a lawsuit related toforeclosure, the newspaper said, citing court papers, otherdocuments and interviews. The Racquet Club's principal officerswere Leonard Kilgore, a former Chappell aide who then was anofficial of rocket manufacturer Avco Corp., and George Dalferes, anemployee of Martin Marietta.   Chappell, chairman of the House Appropriations defensesubcommittee, told the newspaper that Kilgore learned of hisfinancial problems and put together a deal to buy out a bank'soutstanding notes on the health club. Chappell said no one had donehim any favors, and that the deal was an independent transactionbetween the bank and an investors' group.   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson has said no members of Congress areunder investigation in the defense fraud and bribery probe.   In California, The Orange County Register reported Thursday thatit had obtained documents in the probe showing that investigatorswho conducted a series of searches June 14 were looking fordocuments tying defense contractor consultant Fred Lackner toStuart Berlin, a civilian Navy official who drafts contracts forelectronics systems.   Lackner's home and office in the Woodland Hills section of LosAngeles and Berlin's office in Arlington, Va., just outside ofWashington, were searched by FBI agents June 14, when theinvestigation became public.   Berlin, an executive with the Naval Air Systems Command, is oneof six Pentagon officials who have been transferred to other dutiessince the probe became public.   The newspaper obtained documents listing items sought in theJune 14 searches of Lackner's office and home, the offices ofLitton Data Systems in Van Nuys, Calif., Northrop Corp.'s Venturadivision aircraft group and Teledyne Electronics. The Northrop andTeledyne facilities searched are in Newberry Park, Calif.   Lackner's attorney, William Dougherty, told the newspaperLackner had known Berlin for ``10 or 12 years'' and that both haveworked for Litton Industries Inc., of which Litton Data Systems isa division. Lackner was once a contract administrator for Litton.   According to the documents, investigators searching Lackner'shome and office sought documents relating to ``any businessrelationships and@or contacts'' with Berlin, Northrop consultantWilliam Parkin, and Michael Savaides, a Washington marketingrepresentative for Teledyne Electronics.   Parkin's office in Alexandria, Va., also was searched June 14.   The investigators also sought financial and bank records thatwould show payments to Lackner or ``payments from him (that) mayhave been withdrawn in connection with Lackner's transactions withParkin, Berlin and Savaides for the years 1986, 1987, 1988,'' thedocuments said, according to the Register.   The documents revealed that Teledyne employed Parkin for$150,000 in late 1987 or 1988.   Parkin worked for the Navy's Joint Cruise Missile Project Officefrom 1977 to 1983, as chief of the contracting division and asdeputy for acquisition, before becoming a consultant.   In the searches involving Lackner, investigators also sought acommunication from Berlin regarding the disqualification ofTel-Instrument Electronics Corp., a small New Jersey-basedmanufacturer, in the competition for a contract for a radar-testingdevice for the Navy known as the AN@APM 424.   Teledyne has a contract to produce the device, which is used totest electronic ``friend or foe'' systems used in thousands of Navyships and aircraft.   The documents sought in the searches, according to thenewspaper, included an 11-page Marine Corps report, whichinvestigators believe Litton Data Systems had obtained, on abattlefield computer system still on the drawing boards.   In searching Northrop's offices, agents looked for ``contractsor agreements'' between that company and Parkin or Washingtonconsultant William Galvin, and documents pertaining to Northrop'sefforts to obtain a contract to build a pilotless airplane, ordrone. Northrop has a contract to build 100 drones for the Navy for$33.5 million.   Galvin's office in Washington was searched June 14.</TEXT></DOC>
