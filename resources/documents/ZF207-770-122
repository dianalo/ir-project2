Hamilton alleged department officials conspiredto force Inslaw into bankruptcy and force its legal case-tracking software,known as the Prosecutors Management Information System, or Promis, into thepublic domain.andM;In 1986 the company filed suit against Justice alleging the agency improperlytook and controlled advanced versions of Promis.andM;Justice officials refused to cooperate in the subcommittee's investigation,and only a contempt warning prompted the department to provide witnesses fordepositions, the report said.andM;At first, Justice attorneys told the subcommittee they feared theinvestigation would jeopardize the department's appeals and any futurelitigation regarding Inslaw, the report said.andM;Hamilton said the investigations into the case should continue.andM;The subcommittee &quot;says the department did not permit them to look for thefacts,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It can't be very healthy for our concept of government forit to be a dead issue.andP;  The court has made findings of malfeasance that theJustice Department refuses to treat seriously.&quot;andM;For a time last year, the Inslaw controversy threatened to bog down Justice'salready delayed office automation program, Project Eagle.andM;Inslaw attorneys questioned the legitimacy of the $200 million program toprovide office automation across the department and to U.S.andP;  attorneys,because they said Justice planned to use the disputed Promis software onEagle machines.andM;Justice officials denied any connection between the Inslaw contract andProject Eagle.andP;  Justice awarded the Eagle contract late this summer.andM;Subcommittee investigators &quot;found no proof that Inslaw's problems with thedepartment were connected to the Project Eagle procurement,&quot; the report said.andM;Because Eagle system will access Promis, the report warned of possibleproblems should the courts eventually rule that Promis software is not in thepublic domain but does belong to Inslaw.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
