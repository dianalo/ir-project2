On test the well flowed atrates up to 3990 b/d. A further 10 appraisal/development wells drilledin 1984 and 1985 resulted in 9 suspended oil producers. One well, Harriet2, failed to encounter significant hydrocarbons, and was plugged andabandoned. The Harriet field came on stream in January 1986 with oilbeing piped 7 km from a conventional platform (Harriet A) to onshorestorage facilities at Varanus Island in the Lowendal Island group. Sincethen, satellite platforms (Harriet B and C) have been constructed andinstalled and all 10 wells brought into production. The geology of theWA-192-P permit area is presented in Kopsen and McGann (1984). The reservoirformation in the Harriet field is the Flag sandstone member of the LowerCretaceous Barrow group. Depth to the reservoir is approximately 1900m subsea, which is equivalent to a 2-way time of 1500 ms. Reservoir characteristicsare very good with average porosity up to 21 percent and permeabilitiesoften up to 2 darcys. The trap has 3-way dip closure with fault closureon the northwest flank of the structure and is interpreted to be fullwith a spill point on the southwest flank. Although the trapping mechanismis dominantly structural, stratigraphic permeability barriers are presentin the field indicated by the differing oil-water contacts in the HarrietA-5 and B-3 areas.</TEXT></DOC>
