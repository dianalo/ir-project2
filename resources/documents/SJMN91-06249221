Schnacke announced the ruling June 7 and issued a writtendecision July 26.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  California News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  KQED WON'T APPEAL RULING ON EXECUTION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  California News.  </MEMO><TEXT>     KQED (Ch. 9), the public television station that sued last year over denialof access to a scheduled execution, said Wednesday it had decided not toappeal.;   &quot;After lengthy consideration, KQED has concluded that at this pointit is better not to pursue litigation, but let the public debate on this issuecontinue in forums other than the court,&quot; Anthony Tiano, president and chiefexecutive officer of KQED, said in a statement.;   He did not give reasons forthe decision.;   The action apparently means the case will not go before the9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court for rulings that wouldset legal precedents for the same issue elsewhere. Schnacke's ruling is not abinding precedent for future cases.;   Though KQED had the support of onebroadcast trade organization for a possible appeal, most news agenciesdistanced themselves from the effort to get camera access to the deathchamber. A number of major news organizations, including the Associated Press,entered the case to support KQED's successful argument to allow reporters towitness executions.;   The state Assembly this week killed a bill by a deathpenalty opponent that would have allowed cameras at executions. KQED insisted,however, that it took no position on the death penalty and was seeking cameraaccess only to provide information to the public.;   KQED sued in May 1990after San Quentin Warden Daniel Vasquez denied its request to film theexecution of Robert Alton Harris, a convicted double murderer from San Diegowho would have been the first person to die in California's gas chamber since1967. A federal appeals court has blocked Harris' execution.;   The stationargued that the ban on cameras denied the public the most direct access toinformation about executions, and said it should be allowed to use camerasjust as newspaper reporters could use pencils and paper.;   Vasquez saidcameras would endanger guards and witnesses who might be identified, and couldtouch off a riot during periods of tension that surround executions. KQEDsought to dispel those concerns by saying it would focus only on the condemnedprisoner and would use electronic masking to obscure the features of anyoneelse.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910905  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  429  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, September 5, 199100249221,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
