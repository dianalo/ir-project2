Earlier Tuesday, a government-owned company said it foundevidence that it was duped by another West German firm intoproviding plans for a suspeted poison gas factory in Libya,believing the technology was being used for a Hong Kongpharmaceutical plant.   The ARD television network said customs officials in Stuttgartgave Munich investigators documents linking the company Globesat tothe alleged sale of rocket guidance equipment to Libya.   The report gave no additional details but said officials suspectWest German export laws and regulations governing the sale ofmilitary technology may have been violated.   Globesat's Munich offices were closed Tuesday night, and companyofficials could not be immediately reached for comment.   Another Bavarian company is under investigation by prosecutors inMunich in connection with allegations that it helped Libya developthe ability to refuel its warplanes in flight.   Meanwhile, the government-owned Salzgitter Industriebau GmbH saidin a statement that a review of company records ``revealed that werewere deceived'' in its transactions with Imhausen-Chemie, a companysuspected of playing a larger role in the suspected chemical weaponsplant in Libya.   Salzgitter said that among its records was a letter fromImhausen-Chemie that mentioned Rabta, site of the plant south of theLibyan capital of Tripoli. The statement did not reveal furthercontents of the February 1985 letter but said it was turned over toprosecutors investigating possible violations of export laws.   Salzgitter officials have acknowledged doing business with theLahr-based chemical concern but have said it was contracted toproduce engineeering designs for a pharmaceutical plant in Hong Kong.   ``Employees who were working on the Hong Kong project at the timedid not assign any importance to the mention of Rabta'' in theletter, the statement said.   The company said it had also sent experts to Hong Kong to inspectthe factory it was contracted to design and found ``that our workhad not been put to use there.''   It also said switching equipment Salzgitter supplied was notinstalled there.   Salzgitter officials said the company is considering legal actionagainst Imhausen-Chemie.   U.S. officials contend the plant in Libya is designed to producechemical weapons. Libya says it is a pharmaceutical factory.   Imhausen-Chemie is the target of a criminal investigation todetermine if export laws were broken in connection with deliveriesfor the Libyan plant.   Several companies have admitted doing work for Imhausen-Chemie,but deny knowledge that their equipment and blueprints were destinedfor Libya.</TEXT></DOC>
