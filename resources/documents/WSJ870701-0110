In a short statement, Bank Leu said that Mr. Furer had submitted his resignation and that the board accepted it &quot;with regret.&quot; Mr. Furer, 65 years old, will retain his board seat, according to Adolf Braendle, a director. Mr. Furer also is a director of several big Swiss companies and the former chief executive officer of Nestle S.A.    Bank Leu said Mr. Furer had accepted its request to remain chairman until the next annual shareholder's meeting, in March. Mr. Braendle said Mr. Furer's resignation was voluntary and that &quot;the board has never had any doubt about his integrity.&quot; Mr. Furer wasn't available for comment yesterday.    Swiss analysts have anticipated a management shake-up at Bank Leu after its Guinness share purchases, which the Swiss Banking Commission is investigating. Mr. Furer stepped down as a Guinness director at Guinness's request last January. His resignation followed Guinness's disclosure that Bank Leu had participated in a secret effort to keep Guinness's share price high during its successful bid of #2.53 billion (currently equivalent to about $4.09 billion) for Distillers Co. last year.    Bank Leu is Switzerland's sixth-largest bank, with disclosed assets of about $8.52 billion. Guinness is one of Britain's largest liquor and brewing companies.    During and after the Distillers bid, Bank Leu bought shares in Distillers and Guinness shares that resulted in a stake in Guinness of 41 million shares, valued at about #100 million ($161.6 million). Bank Leu also received a payment of #50 million ($80.8 million) from Guinness designed to indemnify it against any loss.    Guinness later said that it couldn't &quot;lawfully have fulfilled&quot; the indemnity agreements, signed by a former director, because British law doesn't allow a company to pay for its own shares without shareholder approval. The Bank Leu purchases and similar ones by other parties also are under scrutiny by the British government.    Since disclosure of the British investigation last December, Bank Leu has sold the Guinness shares and returned the #50 million payment. Bank Leu has said that Mr. Furer didn't arrange the transactions and that neither he nor the bank was aware of their possible illegality in Britain.    Bank Leu also has figured in the U.S. government's insider-trading investigation. It was through Bank Leu's Bahamian subsidiary that former investment banker Dennis B. Levine used inside information to trade on forthcoming U.S. takeovers. Mr. Levine, who pleaded guilty to four felony counts in the case, is serving a two-year prison term. His cooperation with the government led to the implication of takeover specialist Ivan F. Boesky, among others. </TEXT></DOC>
