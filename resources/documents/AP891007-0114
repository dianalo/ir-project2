Labor leaders planned a regional strategy session on Monday,while striking workers took vacations or temporary jobs as thestrike moved through its fourth day.   ``We're going to remain open and ready to do whatever we can tosettle the situation at the right time,'' Boeing spokesman PaulBinder said Saturday. ``We have not at this point planned for anymeetings, scheduled any meetings or made any contact with (federalmediator) Doug Hammond.''   Both Boeing and the union say they are willing to negotiate, butHammond has declined to say who or what was holding things up.   ``I have heard from the union, and they are interested inreturning to the table,'' Hammond said Friday, ``but nothing isscheduled, and I don't foresee anything this weekend.''   In a recorded message at his office Saturday, Hammond said, ``Atthis time there are no meetings scheduled in the Boeing labordispute. If there is any change in this, an announcement will bemade.''   Spokesmen for the Machinists were out of their offices Saturdaymorning and not available for comment.   The strike began Wednesday for 43,300 workers in the Seattlearea, 12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and othersat several locations nationwide.   The machinists voted by 85 percent Tuesday to reject an offerthat included an immediate raise of 4 percent with 3 percent raisesin both 1990 and 1991, annual bonuses of 8 percent of a worker'sgross earnings this year and 3 percent the next plus a reduction inmandatory overtime. The offer also included a cost-of-livingformula to account for virtually all inflation.   Picket lines remained up and supervisory personnel continued tofill in as they could on production lines, Binder said, although hehad no figures on how many people were working.</TEXT></DOC>
