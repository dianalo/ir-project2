The results showthat the concentration of acid is an important factor in controllingthe metal loss caused by wear corrosion processes in the acids. At verydilute acid concentration (10 to the -4 N), Fe behaves differently fromNi. Fe develops a soft, friable deposit, while Ni develops no corrosionlayer. The formation and removal of the corrosion deposit on Fe resultedin high metal loss and coefficient of friction, as compared to the relativelylow metal loss and coefficient of friction observed for Ni. At slightlyhigher acid concentration (10 to the -3 and 10 to the -2 N), no corrosionproducts were produced on both Fe and Ni. Wear of Fe and Ni was generallyat a minimum. At higher acid concentration (10 to the -1 N and above),loss of Fe and Ni increased as the acid concentration increased. In sulfuricacid the maximum loss of both Fe and Ni was at 7.5 N (30 percent) concentration,and the metal losses of both Fe and Ni dropped markedly at 15 N (50 percent)and above. In hydrochloric acid, however, the Fe loss continued to increasewith the increase of acid concentration, and the maximum Fe loss occurredin the most concentrated acid (12.1 N, 37 percent). There were variationsin loss with Ni from specimen to specimen examined in hydrochloric acids(10 to the -1 N and above). The coefficient of friction for Ni increasedslightly with an increase in acid concentration up to 10 to the -2 N.When corrosion started to dominate in the wear-corrosion process, thecoefficient of friction decreased in both sulfuric and hydrochloric acidsat 10 to the -1 N and above. 21 references.</TEXT></DOC>
