An estimated 600,000 barrels a day of Alaskan crude oil bound for the eastern U.S. moves through the 81-mile Panamanian pipeline, so &quot;obviously the implications (of a closing) are positive for the East Coast crude market,&quot; said Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    West Texas Intermediate crude's 32-cent rise on the New York Mercantile Exchange, to $16 a barrel, put prices back to last Thursday's level, and erased part of Monday's 70-cent tumble.    Some traders said they originally thought the pipeline was closed for military reasons, or even that U.S. troops had stormed Panama, where a coup was attempted yesterday. But reports from Panama established that the pipeline wasn't closed by military action but because of a strike by government utility workers, which interrupted power to a pump station.    Joseph J. Ackell, a senior vice president at Northville Industries Corp., Melville, N.Y., the operator and 40%-owner of the pipeline, said it is possible electricity from outside sources such as Costa Rica could be routed to the area of the pump station. Meanwhile, he said, Northville and major shippers such as Exxon Corp. have drawn up contingency plans.    For example, Alaska supertankers -- two carrying 2.5 million barrels are expected to dock in Panama today -- could shift their cargo to smaller ships, which will fit through the Panama Canal, rather than using the pipeline. &quot;It's a question of availability of (smaller) ships,&quot; Mr. Ackell said.    An Energy Department spokeswoman said the pipeline is normally closed two or three days a month anyway. &quot;The Energy Department sees no real cause for concern over the next few days,&quot; she said. &quot;The energy situation is handleable.&quot;    Richard D. Donovan, head of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s international-energy desk, said prices could rally short-term on the Panama news, but movement depends on how long the strike lasts. Short covering -- or traders buying to offset earlier sales -- was responsible for much of yesterday's price increase, he said.    In Nymex's last frenetic hour yesterday, an estimated 40,000 contracts were traded, representing 40 million barrels of oil. By comparison, 66 million barrels traded in all of Tuesday's session.    While analysts agree that the oil markets' tremendous volatility will continue, many say Panama-related news won't necessarily be that important. The oil supply from Panama isn't that significant in the world scheme. &quot;If you're talking about Baghdad or Tehran it's bigger news,&quot; said Mr. Donovan.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   COCOA AND SUGAR: Cocoa futures dropped to five-year lows, with the nearby contract closing at $1,502 a ton, down $44, on the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange in New York. Despite strong demand, the cocoa market is struggling in its fourth consecutive year of unchecked overproduction, said Sandra Kaul, a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. analyst. Reports yesterday that the Ivory Coast, which might have a record cocoa crop this year, has started selling as much as 200,000 tons is &quot;throwing the fear of God into everyone,&quot; said William O'Neill, research director at Elders Futures Inc., New York. Sugar prices surged 0.44 cent a pound, to 8.63 cents, after Egypt bought an estimated 86,000 tons of sugar, more than the anticipated 20,000 tons, Mr. O'Neill said.    COPPER: Prices roared back on strong trade buying after plunging Tuesday. In thin trading on New York's Commodity Exchange, much of it compensation for the previous day's plunge, the nearby contract closed at $1.035 a pound, up 2.4 cents. Boosting buying, said analysts, was the government's report of a sharp 8.9% rise in housing starts in February.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Most grain and soybean futures prices finished lower. Analysts described the day as &quot;dull&quot; and blamed the lackluster performance on the absence of fresh news. May-settlement soybeans closed at $6.1925 a bushel, down 3.5 cents. Analysts also said the market is in a bit of a holding pattern until the end of the month, when the Agriculture Department releases its report on spring-planting intentions. &quot;Everybody is already awaiting the report and standing aside,&quot; said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle-futures prices closed higher in a quiet session. The cattle contract for April settlement finished at 73.97 cents a pound, up 0.15 cent. Analysts said Minneapolis-based Cargill Inc.'s decision to close its Cozad, Neb., slaughtering facility had little effect on the market. The plant &quot;wasn't big enough to cause any ripples,&quot; said Gerald Abbenhaus, an analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc., St. Louis. Traders are also awaiting the Agriculture Department's release of a cattle-on-feed report after tomorrow's close. Most analysts expect a 5.5% increase in the number of animals on feedlot in the seven major beef-producing states as of March 1, compared with the year-earlier period. They also predict a 7% increase in the number of animals sent to slaughter, compared with the year-earlier period, and 4.1% decline in the number of animals placed on feedlots.    INTEREST RATES: Treasury-bond futures prices fell nearly three-quarters of a point as traders sold some of their holdings ahead of this morning's release of January trade data. Most analysts predict the trade deficit for January will widen to $12.8 billion from $12.2 billion in December, mainly due to seasonal factors. Adding downward pressure on bond prices was a stronger-than-expected 8.9% jump in housing starts last month to a 1.5 million annual rate, said Gary Dorsch, a futures analyst with LNS Financial Group Inc., Chicago. Industrial production rose 0.2% in February, which was on target with analysts' projections and had little impact on the market, Mr. Dorsch said. The trade-deficit figure, which will set the market's tone over the next few weeks, will be narrower than expected and should boost bond prices, he predicted. </TEXT></DOC>
