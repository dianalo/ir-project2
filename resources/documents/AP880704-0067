Capt. Will C. Rogers III received support Sunday from thechairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William Crowe, who saidthe airliner was outside commercial air lanes and ignored repeatedwarnings to pull away from U.S. ships in the gulf. He said theairliner was mistaken for an Iranian F-14 attack plane and was shotdown with 290 people aboard.   ``A full investigation will be conducted but it is our judgmentthat based on the information currently available, the localcommanders had sufficient reasons to believe their units were injeopardy and they fired in self defense,'' Crowe said at a Pentagonbriefing.   Rogers was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and now lists his home asSan Diego, the Vincennes' home port. Pentagon officials said theydid not have his date of birth.   In a radio interview before the Vincennes departed for thePersian Gulf in April, Rogers was asked what the ship's responsewould be if attacked and said: ``If we are attacked or hostileintent is demonstrated we will defend ourselves.''   ``There is a very clear-cut set of engagement rules which we goby and we're certainly not there to initiate hostilities,'' Rogerssaid. ``We're there to defend ourselves and carry out what nationalcommand authority dictates.''   Crowe noted that those rules of engagement were changed afterthe May 1987 attack on the USS Stark, in which 37 U.S. sailorsdied. U.S. commanders in the region are under orders to act morequickly and forcefully if their ships are threatened.   Rep. Bill Lowery, R-Calif., said he toured the Vincennes duringexercises off the San Diego coast in February and found Rogers tobe ``a first-rate professional.''   ``It's a well-trained and disciplined crew and skipper,'' Lowerysaid.   Rogers also was supported by a former Navy lieutenant whosurvived the May 1987 attack on the USS Stark in which 37 U.S.sailors died. Basil E. Moncrief Jr., who resigned from the Navy inthe wake of the attack, said Rogers had no choice but to defend hisship.   ``If the plane was unfortunate enough to be flying toward theVincennes while the Vincennes was engaging Iranian patrol boats ...I'm not surprised this kind of thing would happen,'' he told theCorpus Christi Caller-Times. ``I don't think the Vincennes had muchchoice other than to fire.''   Before taking command of the Vincennes, Rogers served in thePentagon as head of a section in the Planning Division of Chief ofNaval Operations, the commander of the Navy, according to abiography released at the Pentagon.   His first command was the destroyer USS Cushing, from September1981 to August 1984, the statement said.   He was commissioned in December 1965 through officer trainingschool and spent his first tour of duty aboard the aircraft carrierUSS Independence, qualifying as a main watch officer, a mainpropulsion division officer and an assistant combat informationcenter officer.   Rogers is married to Sharon Rogers, also from Fort Worth, Texas.They and their son, Will Rogers IV, live in San Diego, Calif., amain Navy base for the Pacific Ocean.   The captain is not related to the late American humorist, WillRogers, according to the humorist's son, Will Rogers Jr.</TEXT></DOC>
