But Frank Cihlar learned thehard way that joining the fold carries an enormous risk.   Several years after leaving his former law firm, theWashington, D.C., attorney is being sued for five months ofoffice rent that hasn't been paid. What's more, Mr. Cihlarfinds to his dismay that he's potentially liable for theentire unpaid amount, roughly $47,000 as of Oct. 31. And hisexposure could theoretically grow by $10,000 a month for thenext 10 years.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;A partnership can really be a can of worms,&quot; he says.   Mr. Cihlar, 48 years old, is being squeezed by theunlimited-liability principle that undergirds the partnershipform of business. It is a problem that's emerging as a majorconcern for professionals and many entrepreneurs in thesehard economic times. Problems often involve office leases.   &quot;There are increasing instances of professional firmsgoing out of business and having to negotiate settlementswith landlords,&quot; says Howard Mudrick, vice president ofHildebrandt Inc., a Somerville, N.J., legal consulting firm.   But their pain may be others' gain, specialists say. Witha bit of shrewd bargaining, entrepreneurs and professionalslaunching firms in the currently depressed real estate marketmay be able to blunt their liability to landlords.   In a general partnership, the form of organization formost service professionals and many small businesses,partners are individually responsible for all of the firm'sfinancial obligations. (By contrast, the amount that acreditor can recover from a corporation is limited to itsassets.)   The predicament of many such firms stems from the economicboom of the early 1980s. In those days, many small law,accounting, architectural and consulting firms and smallbusinesses signed long-term office agreements on the theorythat both their revenues, and the value of their leases,would increase indefinitely. But many of these firms havestumbled in the recession. With clients cutting back andrevenue eroding, they are having trouble meeting their leasepayments.   &quot;It's the sort of problem that's haunting a lot ofprofessionals these days,&quot; says Jay Westbrook, a professor atthe University of Texas Law School in Austin.   It's certainly haunting Mr. Cihlar. In 1982, he and histhree former partners in the firm of Ward, Lazarus, Grow andamp;Cihlar signed a 20-year lease on a downtown Washingtontownhouse owned by a unit of the Roman Catholic Archdioceseof Washington. The rent was $8,533 a month and has sincerisen to $10,000 a month. No less than the archbishop ofWashington, now Cardinal James Hickey, signed the lease.   The lawyers weren't worried about meeting the rentpayments, Mr. Cihlar recalls. &quot;With the history of escalatingreal estate values in Washington, we felt we could turnaround and sublet if we had to, and at least break even,&quot; hesays.   But things began to go awry for the law firm in 1986 whenit became an unwelcome bit player in one of Britain's largestcorporate scandals. Thomas Ward, one of the firm's partnersand a director of the giant brewing company Guinness PLC, wascharged by British authorities with receiving an illegalpayment of $8.3 million from Guinness for alleged stock-pricemanipulation during a corporate takeover fight. SeveralGuinness executives, including the former chairman, have beenconvicted for their roles in the scheme. Mr. Ward contendsthe payment was proper, and is fighting the charge.   Guinness, which had been the law firm's biggest client byfar, pulled all its business, and sued the firm for return oflegal documents. Suddenly, the law firm was hiring lawyers todefend itself, and without the income provided by its No. 1client. &quot;Overnight we were history,&quot; Mr. Cihlar says.   He left in 1987, and is now an attorney with the JusticeDepartment. Efforts by the remaining partners to sublet thebuilding have failed, according to Mr. Cihlar. Mr. Ward, whois practicing alone, is now the building's only commercialoccupant.   Negotiations with the archdiocese, which is seeking ajudgment for rent due against the four lawyers, have boggeddown. Mr. Cihlar says he senses &quot;irony in the Catholicarchbishop acting like a hard-nosed landlord.&quot; He adds: &quot;Thebad news is that there's another 10 years left on the lease.&quot;   Says Paul Interdonato, attorney for the archdiocese: &quot;I'mholding all of them as a group responsible, and I'm holdingeach one responsible for the total rent.&quot;   Specialists say Mr. Cihlar's tale should serve as awarning flag to newly formed partnerships that may be temptedto commit their firms to long-term office leases at currentbargain-basement rates. They suggest instead that partnersshould exploit the glut of empty office space nationwide toescape the liability hammerlock.   Landlords anxious to fill their buildings may be willingto limit the extent of an individual partner's financialobligation in case of default, they say. And small firms cansometimes strike short-term office-sharing arrangements withlarger partnerships with excess space to avoid the liabilityrisk altogether.   &quot;In most office markets {currently}, the tenant has a lotof bargaining power,&quot; says Ward Bower, a managementconsultant at Altman Weil Pensa Inc., Newtown Square, Pa.,which specializes in law firms.   Of course, landlords can be pushed only so far. Prof.Westbrook of the University of Texas says persuadingcreditors to accept a lien on a firm's outstanding billingsin lieu of personal liability would be &quot;creative,&quot; but hethinks the average landlord would be hesitant.   And Margaret Schaaf, a partner in the Seattle law firmDavis Wright Tremaine says she &quot;doesn't know of any magicsolution.&quot; She suggests asking landlords if they're willingto trade personal liability for a large security deposit orletter of credit. She says beleaguered small partnershipssometimes simply walk away from their leases, hopinglandlords won't go after their personal assets.   Transferring assets to spouses can put them out of therange of creditors, though Mr. Bower notes that this &quot;takessome real confidence in your marital situation.&quot;   Charles Temkin, a partner in the Washington law firm Shaw,Pittman, Potts andamp; Trowbridge, says the difficulty partnershipshave in forecasting their growth makes committing to officespace dicey.   &quot;Partnerships are typically cramped, or they have spacethey can't use,&quot; Mr. Temkin says, and this makes real estatelenders &quot;very antsy; . . . there's a lot of pressure toensure there are humans who will suffer if the rentalpayments aren't met.&quot;   Washington lawyer Austin Frum's three-person firm hastried to sidestep the problem by subleasing about 1,500square feet of excess space on a two-year, nonrenewablebasis, from a large law firm. &quot;For most lawyers, makingpartner in a law firm has been like winning some sort ofmedal, but it has its dark side,&quot; Mr. Frum observes.</TEXT></DOC>
