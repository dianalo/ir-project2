(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The city's first black school superintendentwas reinstated and five black school board members were urged toreturn to their posts Tuesday after racial turmoil forced theclosing of two public schools.   The all-white Selma Board of Education announced NorwardRoussell's reinstatement as superintendent and the closing of all11 schools in the system Wednesday in a compromise aimed at endingweeks of protests.   The Rev. F.D. Reese, Selma High's black principal who was namedinterim superintendent Sunday, announced he was resigning soRoussell could resume his duties.   Moments after Reese's announcement, black protest leaders metwith Mayor Joe Smitherman to discuss ways of ending weeks of racialconflict over the operation of the predominantly black schoolsystem. The 6,000-student city school system is about 70 percentblack.   Smitherman and black leaders gave no details of the proposedcompromise, but both sides made clear that Roussell's return wouldbe a crucial element in any resolution of the conflict.   The board announced later Tuesday that Roussell would resume hisduties and all 11 schools in the system would be closed Wednesday``due to recent disturbances and turmoil which have preventednormal operation of our school system.''   ``Selma city schools will reopen upon adequate assurances to Dr.Roussell and the board that the safety and physical welfare of ourstudents and all school employees can be ensured,'' the schoolboard said in a statement.   The board has been made up of six whites since the five blackmembers announced they were resigning following a vote _ alongracial lines _ in December against extending Roussell's contractbeyond its June expiration date.   The five later said they had not signed any official resignationpapers, leaving open their return.   Mostly black Selma High School, with 1,508 students, and almostall-black Eastside Middle School, with 407 students, closed Tuesdayas racial tensions rose following the arrest of four black leadersin a melee at Smitherman's City Hall office the day before.   Reese said there were instances of racial fighting at Selma HighSchool, and called for the orderly dismissal of students from thecity's only public high school because ``we could certainly see andfeel the level of tensions among the students.''   Police were called to the school, but Smitherman said no arrestswere made.   Dozens of the black students joined in a series ofdemonstrations outside City Hall on Tuesday. With adults, theycarried signs saying ``Smitherman Must Go,'' sang songs of thecivil rights movement and called for Roussell's reinstatement.   Roussell was at Selma High School as throngs of parents andstudents left the building. He joined in helping disperse crowds ofstudents ``so we would not have any trouble.''   Protesters have charged Roussell was dismissed because he isblack, an allegation denied by white school board members. Theycited an unfavorable job evaluation and Roussell's management styleas the reason for his firing.   Last week, the remaining white board members decided to removeRoussell from his $80,000-a-year job immediately, and on Sundayinstalled Reese as interim superintendent.</TEXT></DOC>
