General Motors Corp. said its North Tarrytown, N.Y., assembly plant will remain closed next week for an additional week of inventory adjustment. It will be the third week the plant has been shut down. When operations resume, the plant will build 50 Pontiac 6000 and Buick Century midsized cars an hour instead of 54, as previously reported. Two other GM plants remain closed for model changeover.    Chrysler Corp.'s Belvidere, Ill., assembly plant still is shut down because of a parts shortage caused by the Canadian Auto Workers strike, which was recently settled. It is scheduled to resume work with one eight-hour shift next week.    Volkswagen of America Inc.'s U.S. car plant resumed production this week. It had been closed for model changeover. The company is a unit of Volkswagen AG of West Germany.    GM expects to build 70,627 cars this week, compared with 62,853 cars last week; Ford Motor Co., 37,640, compared with 34,478; and Chrysler, 21,700, compared with 22,185.    Ford is scheduling overtime tomorrow at one car-assembly plant and at three truck-assembly plants.    ---             This    Last   Yr.
