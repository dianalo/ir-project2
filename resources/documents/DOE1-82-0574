<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-82-0574 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method for efficient simultaneous extraction of high-molecular-weightDNA and RNA from solid mammalian tissues including clinical biopsiesis described. It is based on the disruption and subsequent melting ofdeep frozen tissue in the presence of frozen phenol and nucleic acidextraction buffer; this allows for simultaneous disruption of tissueand inactivation of nucleases. The yield is about 0.7-5.8 mg of DNA and0.5-8.1 mg of total RNA/g of tissue depending upon the tissue type; thisis higher than the yield of other methods tested. Analysis of total RNAby denaturing gel electrophoresis, and of DNA and poly(A)+ RNA by Southernand Northern blot hybridization using {sup 32}P and biotinylated probes,indicated that c-Ha-ras gene and its transcripts were undegraded. Biotinylatedand {sup 32}P probes had approximately the same sensitivity in detectingnucleic acids on Southern and Northern blots. This extraction procedureis simple and, when used with biotinylated probes, is rapid, inexpensive,and nonhazardous. The methodology can be modified for use with otherclinical samples and cells grown in culture.</TEXT></DOC>
