(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>In terms of fast setup, direct status checking, low maintenance, and nearlyeffortless troubleshooting, the $995 Data Manager XL- 100 with 512K buffer,eight serial ports with RJ-11 connections, two DB-25 parallel ports, and oneEthernet port is a PC resource person's dream machine.andP;  The Ethernet portallows the user to connect an Ethernet network of up to 16 PCs to the DataManager to share its attached printers.andP;  Configured for our tests, with sixserial cables for PC connections, the system's price totaled $1,074.20.andM;The 5-pound 12- by 6- by 7-inch printer-sharing device features a directaccess, four-key control panel with a 16-character LCD that configures andcontrols all port operations through multilevel menus.andP;  From the controlpanel there are three top-level menu selections: Setup, Job, and Status.andP;  TheData Manager's Setup menu offers three options: Standard, Advanced, andEthernet.andP;  Call up the Advanced menu and you have access to the complete listof configuration parameters for each of the unit's ports, includinginput/output selection, transmission rates, stop bit settings, timeouts, andhandshaking.andM;Options in all menus are selected and entered using the plus, minus, andenter keys on the panel.andP;  The Jobs menu displays the status of print jobsqueued and printing.andP;  The Status menu displays the printer configurations andoutput-destination selections for assigned ports-it's that straightforward.andO;Best of all, documenting the system setup is as simple as cycling through themenu to the appropriate point and printing a configuration report.andP;  The LCDconstantly monitors the changes in memory as files move in and out of thebuffer on to their destinations.andM;IMC supplies a 30K pop-up, called IMCDOS, that is useful for sending commandsto printers and devices attached to the Data Manager, but the TSRunfortunately doesn't operate under DOS 4.0.andP;  (IMC is updating IMCDOS-therevised version was not available for review.) The only software you need forusing the Data Manager on a standard DOS platform, however, is a 20K utilitycalled COMSET; it supports all transmission speeds from 9,600 bps to 115,200bps, by way of character-switch combinations.andP;  For example the command&quot;COMSET 1 1,&quot; entered into the AUTOEXEC.BAT, sets the PC to support datatransmission at 115,200 bps.andM;The Data Manager generally turned in exceptional scores on the Time to Sendtest but was not nearly as impressive on the Time to Print test.andP;  Inaddition, the Data Manager failed to manage the simultaneous printing of theWord for Windows and PostScript documents on the pass/fail tests.andM;For the most part, this is a no-brainer box.andP;  Set it up, plug in the cables,put it in the closet, and when problems arise, check out the control panelLCD.andP;  Just about any operation can be handled and set from the box-headers,form feeds, port redirections, priority status-and everything else can bemanaged from DOS.andP;  If you do run into trouble, IMC offers a one-year warrantywith a toll-free support line.andM;As for options, IMC offers signal boosting parallel converters withindependent power supplies for $59.95, 10foot and 100-foot cables at $2.50and $25.00 each, and buffer memory upgrades at $300 per 2MB.andP;  The 16-portversion of the XL lists for $1,295.andM;This is a plug-and-print product.andP;  Once the software catches up to thecurrent DOS, the Data Manager XL-100 will be an even more versatileprinter-sharing device than it is now.andM;Data Manager XL-l00 IMC/Data manager, 1360 Bordeaux Dr., Sunnyvale, CA 64089;800-537-5999,408744-9004.andM;List Price: Including 1 MB RAM, sight serial and two parallel ports, $995.00;as tested, with five 10-foot six-wire telephone-style cables, one 100-footsix-wire telephone-style cable, six adapters,  1,074,20.andM;Requires: 20K RAM per PC, DOS 2.0 or later, cables.andP;  In Short: Aprinter-sharing device that's effortless tO install, maintain, andtroubleshOOt.andP;  There's little excuse for the current version Of the TSR notworking with DOS 4.0, but the memory-resident utility is not necessary to runthe package.andP;  Once the software catches uP, the XL.100 will be even moreversatile than it is now.andP;  If you're looking for a printer-sharing devicethat provides network-like control over printer use, take a look at theByteway 1000 Plus 8PIMB.andP;  This parallel only unit from Protec MicrosystemsInc. lets you control which PCs can print on which printers, and it providespassword security for changing the setup.andM;The Byteway 1000 Plus actually comes in several flavors.andP;  The 8P, which isthe version we tested, offers eight parallel ports with female DB -25connectors.andP;  One port is dedicated to input and one to output, leaving sixthat are user-definable.andP;  There is also the 8S, with eight serial ports, andthe 4P4S, with four serial and four parallel ports.andP;  The base price in eachcase is $685 with 256K RAM,  $775 with 512K, and $895 with IMB; all pricesinclude a one-year warranty.andP;  Our review unit included the full 1MB.andM;Cabling for the 8P model can be expensive, since you need 25-wire shieldedcables for each port.andP;  Protec neither includes any cables with the unit norsells them as options, so you'll have to get them elsewhere.andP;  For printers,the unit uses the same printer cable that otherwise connects directly to aPC.andP;  For PCs, it uses a straight-through cable.andM;The Byteway 1000 Plus allows surprisingly long cables.andP;  One of the drawbacksof parallel connections is that they are normally limited to much shorterlengths than serial connections.andP;  Protec, however, claims that the Byteway1000 Plus can handle a maximum cable length of 100 feet.andP;  Indeed, in ourtests, the 100foot connection worked without problems.andP;  THREE-STEP INSTALLGetting the unit up and running takes three steps.andP;  The first step,installing the hardware consists merely of plugging all the cables in.andP;  Thesecond step, installing the software on each computer's hard disk, is almostas easy thanks to an automated install program.andP;  You can skip this step forany PCs that you plan to limit to using a single printer.) The thirdstep-configuring the printer-sharing options-is somewhat more difficult andmay present a problem to all but the most experienced users.andP;  One minor issueis that you can't even get to the configuration menu unless you know thepassword: &quot;PROTEC&quot; as shipped, an easy-to-miss item in the manual.andP;  A moreimportant issue is that the manual may be confusing to less experiencedusers, since it covers both the parallel and serial versions of the unit.andP;  Ifyou run into trouble, Protec does offer a toll free number for technicalsupport.andP;  Once you have the Byteway 1000 Plus set up, using it isstraightforward.andP;  The package includes control software that lets you runcommands such as selecting a printer from a menu.andP;  Even better is an editorthat lets you add, change, or delete the menu choices and the commands thatgo with them.andP;  You can run the control software either as a TSR or as aforeground program.andM;If you choose to run it as a TSR, you can pick the hotkey from variouscombinations of Alt, Ctrl, and Shift keys.andP;  The TSR can take from 21K to 37Kof RAM, depending on the video card in the PC.andM;SLOW YET RELIABLEandM;On PC Magazine Labs' tests, the Byteway 1000 Plus generally handed inlower-thanaverage times across the board.andP;  But it was also one of only threeunits to sail through all the pass/fail tests without a problem.andP;  Unlike manyof the programs included with these devices, the TSR had no trouble poppingup over Microsoft Word in graphics mode, or restoring the screen afterward.andO;In short, the package may plod on occasion, but it always gets where it'sgoing.andM;The bank of LED status lights on the front panel makes a nice touch.andP;  Inaddition to the power-on light, you'll find a status light for each port,indicating which ports are active at any given instant.andP;  Most of the time,such status indicators are irrelevant.andP;  When you run into a problem, though,they can be invaluable for troubleshooting.andM;It's also worth noting that you're not likely to run out of room forexpansion.andP;  The Byteway 1000 Plus will let you cascade units ten-deep, so youcan easily have more ports available than you are ever likely to want on aprinter-sharingandM;The key strength of the Byteway 1000 Plus is its flexibility.andP;  If all youneed is a plug-and-play unit that lets any of several computers use either oftwo parallel printers, the Byteway 1000 Plus is probably the wrong choice.andO;But if you need administrative functions-like password security, definableports, and limiting access to particular printers-this unit may well be worththe marginal extra work involved.andM;Byteway 1000 Plus 8P1MB Protec Microsysems Inc., 297 Labrosse, Montreal,Quebec H9R 1A3, Canada; 800363-8156,andM;List Price: including 1MB RAM, eight parallel ports, $895.andM;Requires: 21-37K RAM per PC, cables.andM;In Short: One of only two units to pass all of our Dass/fall tests, theByteway offers features such as letting you define which workstations canprint to which printer.andP;  Despite its parallel connections for up to twoprinters and six workstations, the unit offers decidedly below averageperformance.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
