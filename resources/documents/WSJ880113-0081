The market faces some major hurdles, including the need for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approval. If that is obtained, the exchange says the market could begin operations sometime in 1988, providing a new vehicle for energy-price speculation and a hedging tool for the natural-gas industry, with which producers and end-users can lock in prices.    Arlon Tussing, a Seattle-based economist who helped design the gas-futures contract, says it would also provide gas buyers and sellers with more reliable and impartial market information for the pricing of their own transactions. The need for such information has grown recently, prompted by deregulation of the North American natural-gas market and the emergence of short-term, or spot-market transactions.    Until the early 1980s, most natural gas was sold through long-term contracts and was subject to government price controls. Currently, long-term and spot gas prices are usually considered confidential and are disclosed only on an informal basis by trade publications or by traders who may have an interest in the market.    Lance Schneier, president of Yankee Gas Co., a Dublin, Ohio, gas-marketing concern, says gas-futures trading could &quot;parallel the experience with oil,&quot; where the crude-futures market, established less than five years ago, now provides a more-trusted benchmark for world prices than anything put forward by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.    The mercantile exchange began work on a gas-futures market in 1985, but its efforts have been hampered until now by various issues, including continuing regulatory problems in the gas industry and the complexities of arranging a delivery system for contracts.    Earlier this month, the exchange disclosed that it has resolved the delivery matter by creating an interchange service at Katy, Texas, near Houston. The interchange would be operated by a pipeline unit of Yankee Gas, with participation by three other pipeline companies: Coronado Transmission Co.; Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., a unit of Transco Energy Co., and Trunkline Gas Co., a unit of Panhandle Eastern Corp.    But the interchange remains subject to approval by the Department of Energy's FERC, which already has a massive load of gas-regulatory issues to consider. A date hasn't been set for a decision on the interchange. If approved, futures trading would still be subject to clearance by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, another U.S. agency.    Some analysts, like Houston-based William A. Johnson, say gas transportation is still too heavily regulated for the short-term trading of contracts to make sense.    &quot;It's not exactly an industry like oil, that is governed by market forces,&quot; says Mr. Johnson, partner in the consulting firm Jofree Corp. &quot;As long as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission maintains an active role, I don't see that the futures market has much future.&quot;    If a gas-futures market does get off the ground, it will probably move independent of oil because prices of the two commodities are influenced by different factors, says Vinod Dar, president of Dallas-based gas marketer Hadson Gas Systems Corp., a unit of Hadson Corp.    Compared with oil, Mr. Dar says gas is more seasonal, with a relatively higher demand during the peak winter-heating season. Because its transportation uses are negligible, demand for gas falls much more in warm weather than does demand for oil, which benefits from the summerdriving season.    Also, oil prices respond to political changes within OPEC while gas prices respond to U.S. government action, such as regulatory changes by FERC. In fact, the commission's recent rule change -- known as Order 500 -- has apparently driven spot gas prices in Texas as high as $2.10 a million British thermal units from $1.35 in October, while oil prices have plunged in response to the latest breakdown in OPEC's price-setting powers.    David A. Doctor, president of Entrade Corp., a Louisville, Ky.-based gas marketer, says the futures market might soften gas-price movements. &quot;I think this winter bears out the need for some type of hedging mechanism,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
