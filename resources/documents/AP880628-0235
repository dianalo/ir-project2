HIDLAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's largest doctors' group Tuesdayreaffirmed its strong opposition to mercy killing, but rejected amove to restrict its prestigious medical journal's publication ofarticles about euthanasia.   The American Medical Association's 420-member House ofDelegates, a legislative body representing 295,000 members,approved a statement stressing its opposition ``to a physicianintentionally causing the death of a patient.''   The delegates reiterated their stand in the wake of an uproarover the publication of an article in January in the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association. The article by an unidentified doctordescribed how he ended a cancer patient's life, at her request,with a lethal dose of morphine.   The story, called ``It's Over Debbie,'' touched off widespreadcriticism of the journal for not publishing the author's name andfor not including a clear statement of the AMA's opposition tomercy killing. The author had requested that his name be withheld.   But the delegates rejected a proposal requiring the AMA to``refrain from publishing articles which involve the taking ofhuman life'' without also printing the association's stand againstmercy killing.   ``What is termed `active euthanasia' is a euphemism for theintentional killing of a person; this is not part of the practiceof medicine, with or without the consent of the patient,'' statesthe policy approved Tuesday.   Also Tuesday, delegates voted to call on the federal governmentto end price supports for tobacco and help tobacco farmers begingrowing other products. Delegates postponed action until Wednesdayon a proposal to call for the doubling of the federal tobacco tax.   The AMA's annual policy-making convention runs through Thursday.   The delegates were scheduled to vote on a measure seeking toshift the focus of the nation's war on drugs from drug traffickersto users, but postponed action until Wednesday. A committee thattook testimony on the policy Tuesday recommended its adoption.   The policy recommends that the federal government expand drugabuse treatment programs, ease regulations to permit privatedoctors to treat heroin abusers with methadone and beef up drugeducation programs aimed at teen-agers. The policy also calls onthe president to appoint a high-ranking official to oversee thegovernment's drug policy and reduce rivalry among drug-fightingagencies.   The delegates are to vote Wednesday and Thursday on proposals torevamp the Medicaid health insurance system for the poor, create anew type of bedside hospital worker and battle the AIDS crisis.   Before the delegates began voting on more than 300 policyproposals, each was referred to a hearing committee. The committeesthen heard comments from doctors and issued recommendations Tuesday.   The committees recommended:   _Approving a plan to overhaul Medicaid by setting nationaleligibility standards and uniform payments for medical care. Theproposal, which would require federal government action, calls forexpanding Medicaid to provide coverage to an estimated 27 millionpeople living in poverty but not receiving government health-carebenefits. The move would cost an estimated $24 billion at 1988spending levels.   _Developing an AMA pilot project to test the idea of creating anew class of hospital bedside worker, called a ``registered caretechnologist,'' in an effort to offset the nursing shortage.   These workers would handle such chores as bathing patients,taking vital signs and changing bandages. The committee recommendedthat the trustees work with the American Nurses' Associationofficials, which opposes the plan.   _Approving a series of policies for slowing the spread of AIDS,including a recommendation that states seriously consider programsto trace the sexual partners of all AIDS victims. The policies alsocall for extending anti-discrimination laws to include AIDS victims.   The committee recommendation also called for approval of apolicy supporting mandatory testing of all prison inmates for theAIDS virus. But it urged the AMA's governing board of trustees toreevaluate the policy over the next six months.   Also Tuesday, the delegates had been scheduled to vote on aproposal to call on state and federal governments to limit theamount of money awarded in product liability lawsuits. The vote waspostponed until Wednesday.   According to a report prepared by AMA trustees, biomedicalcompanies have slowed development of new vaccines, drugs and other``potentially life-saving technologies'' because of the fear oflitigation.</TEXT></DOC>
