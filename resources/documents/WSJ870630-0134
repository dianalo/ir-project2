But they aren't buying the &quot;revolutionary&quot; product that Japanese electronics makers believed would bring them big profits. Makers say sales -- currently limited to Japan -- are hurt by the high cost of the new machines, foreign record-company resistance and a limited selection of prerecorded DAT music.    DAT recorders &quot;aren't selling well at all,&quot; says a sales manager for Ishimaru Denki, a major consumer-electronics chain. &quot;People who know about them come and look, but they don't buy.&quot;    That isn't how it was supposed to be. The digital machines reproduce music far more accurately than conventional cassette decks, and the industry had high hopes for the new equipment. &quot;For a product that has so much potential, it's disappointing,&quot; says Akiko Emori, an analyst with Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd.    DAT recorders change music into a digital code like that used on compact disks. Because the recorders can copy CDs and tapes, Western record companies are afraid the machines will make it easier to pirate songs. So they have pushed for modifications in the DAT recorders that would prevent them from duplicating recordings. The Japanese are resisting.    So far, Japan is the only country where DAT recorders are sold. The Japanese have been reluctant to market the machines in the U.S. and Europe for fear of exacerbating record-company resistance. Record companies have been seeking help from lawmakers and have refused to license their music for the DAT format.    Still, some industry executives believe the outlook for DAT recorder sales may be improving. Several U.S. politicians have backed off from their hard-line stance. Record-industry officials also are retreating from their initial insistence that DAT makers use a &quot;spoiler&quot; device developed by CBS Inc. to prevent record copying.    Even so, it could take several years before the DAT players produce a bonanza for Japanese electronics makers. Overseas sales must take off first, and recording companies must offer larger libraries of digital audio tapes.    When Japan introduced DAT prototypes last year, the Recording Industry Association of America and other industry groups demanded that the Japanese place the CBS-designed spoiler device, named Copycode, in their machines. Otherwise, record companies say, music pirates would have a field day churning out near-perfect copies of commercial tapes and records.    This year, several U.S. lawmakers sought to amend a trade bill to block the import of DAT players without spoiler devices. The International Federation of Phonogram and Videogram Producers wants similar restrictions in Europe.    Undaunted by troubles overseas, Sony Corp., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and five other Japanese DAT makers began marketing their machines domestically in February and March. Industry executives predicted 100,000 machines would be sold in Japan this year.    So far, according to one industry estimate, only 10,000 recorders have been sold. Sony, the largest maker, says it sold 6,000 machines by June. That's &quot;a little short of the company's original goal,&quot; a Sony official says. Others hint they are losing money on DAT recorders.    The recorders cost about 200,000 yen ($1,400), so only well-heeled audiophiles can afford the machines. And only big-city stores stock them. Of course, new electronics gadgets usually start out with high prices. Compact-disk players, for example, took two years to catch on, and then only after prices dropped below 50,000 yen.    And prices won't fall until the West begins buying the machines and makers can increase production. &quot;They won't get much cheaper&quot; without the U.S. market, says a Matsushita official. &quot;If we don't export, sales will be severely limited.&quot;    But there is still the problem of what to play on the expensive machines. Big Western recording companies such as Thorn-EMI Ltd. and CBS-Sony Group Inc. refuse to supply their music for the DAT format (which puts Sony in an ironic situation, with its manufacturing arm trying to sell DAT recorders while its joint-venture record company with CBS refusing to supply music for prerecorded DAT tapes). &quot;If you can't get prerecorded tapes,&quot; says Ms. Emori, the Jardine Fleming analyst, &quot;there's little point in buying a piece of equipment that costs 200,000 yen.&quot;    But company officials here say that foreign resistance to DAT recorders is softening. They note that U.S. Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.), a hard-liner on trade matters, withdrew his cosponsorship of the proposed trade-bill amendment requiring the spoiler device. Mr. Danforth says the law would have prevented home taping, which he thinks should be allowed.    And Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) told a trade gathering in Chicago that he considered the DAT debate &quot;a copyright or intellectual-property protection issue,&quot; rather than a trade issue. &quot;I think the picture presented of a nation trying to lock out a new technology isn't a pretty one.&quot;    Trying to force an anti-copying device on the makers isn't acceptable either, the Japanese say. Makers have claimed that the CBS spoiler system mars music. Audio experts are beginning to agree.    The CBS Copycode system cuts a sliver of sound out of recorded music. This signals the DAT's circuitry to stop recording. The record industry claims the signal is inaudible. The Japanese disagree.    The recording industry inadvertently may have proved the Japanese correct. Last month, 200 international recording-industry executives met in London to press their demands for the CBS Copycode. Thorn-EMI brought sound engineers and music critics to its studios to demonstrate that the Copycode won't affect the sound.    But the demonstration went awry, electronics company officials here say. The music critics said the code was audible, though subtle, especially on high piano notes. &quot;It backfired on them,&quot; says a Japanese industry official. </TEXT></DOC>
