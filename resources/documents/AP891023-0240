The Journal said the group is seeking reactions to the new deal,valued at $225 to $240 a share, or about $5.09 billion.   To avoid the risk of rejection, the group doesn't plan toformally present the plan at a UAL board meeting today, thenewspaper said.   Instead, the bidding group will seek binding commitments frombanks covering all the money needed to finance the buyout beforemaking a formal proposal, the Journal said. The group hasn't fullydeveloped the idea yet or discussed it with banks, according to theJournal.   Meanwhile, the Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago Tribune said theemployee-management group intends to submit a revised proposal tothe UAL board at today's meeting.   Representatives of United's top management, pilots and flightattendants prepared a proposal over the weekend and will present itat today's board meeting, the papers reported in today's editions.The Chicago newspapers said the bid is in the range of $220 to $250a share.   Such an offer would be substantially lower than the $6.75billion, or $300-a-share, offer the board accepted in September.That leveraged buyout collapsed when it failed to get necessarybank financing.   The original deal would have given management and labor an 85percent stake in UAL under the largest employee buyout in corporatehistory. British Airways PLC would have taken a 15 percentownership stake in return for a $750 million investment.   After the deal's financing fell through on Oct. 13, sparking arout on Wall Street and a 190-point plunge in the Dow Jonesindustrial average, uncertainty surrounding the situation causedBritish Airways to pull out.   No new investor has been found to replace the foreign carrier,all three newspapers reported.   Citicorp reportedly approached potential lenders last week,offering higher interest rates and loan fees. The bank has not,however, offered term sheets, the written terms that must first beapproved by the buyout group.   United's directors have a difficult decision to make, analystssaid. United shares last week lost 40 percent of their value, or$111.25. On Friday United stock closed at $168.50.   A significantly lower bid might be hard for shareholders toswallow, particularly those who bought shares for $250 or more. Ifthe directors accept a lower offer, they could be vulnerable toshareholder lawsuits, analysts said.   But if they reject the offer, a corporate raider might buy uplow-priced UAL stock and then seek stockholder consent to oust theboard.   An alternative, some say, is a partial financial restructuringgiving shareholders a large cash dividend and securities. Such aplan would give employees a sizable stake, if not a majority, inthe company.</TEXT></DOC>
