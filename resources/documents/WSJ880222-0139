Greenberger (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MDEST </CO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jordan's King Hussein, seeing nothing new in the latest U.S. Mideast peace initiative, doesn't plan to meet with Secretary of State George Shultz during the secretary's trip to the region beginning this week, according to U.S. and foreign sources.    The decision by the Jordanian monarch, who is in Europe, to remain there while Mr. Shultz visits Israel, Egypt, Jordan and probably Syria, demonstrates the difficulties the U.S. is having convincing the major countries in the region to negotiate over the future of the Israel-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.    Israel's coalition government is unable to reach agreement on how to proceed, and Palestinian underground leaders are calling for increased turmoil during Mr. Shultz's visit to demonstrate their distrust of the U.S. effort.    A diplomatic source said that during recent visits from U.S. envoys, King Hussein wasn't told anything about the U.S. initiative that he believed could form the basis for more involvement by Jordan. The source added that the Reagan administration ignored until recently King Hussein's warnings that the Arab-Israeli problem would ignite unless the U.S. became actively involved in prodding the parties. As a result, Mr. Shultz's hastily arranged trip is seen by the Jordanians more as an effort in damage control, now that violence has broken out, than as a long-term peace effort.    During his visit, Mr. Shultz is expected to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Syrian President Hafez Assad and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. In Jordan, Mr. Shultz will meet with Crown Prince Hassan Bin Talal, who is King Hussein's brother, and senior officials.    If some unexpected progress is made, however, it's possible King Hussein could meet with Mr. Shultz either in Jordan or in Europe, where Mr. Shultz will attend a North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Brussels after leaving the Mideast.    The U.S. peace plan, which Mr. Shultz calls a &quot;blend of ideas,&quot; calls for quick local-autonomy elections in the Israeli-occupied territories, followed by negotiations beginning in December involving Jordan, Israel and Palestinian representatives over the final resolution of the territories.    Speaking yesterday on ABC's &quot;This Week with David Brinkley,&quot; Hanna Siniora, a Palestinian editor, said the Palestinians want Israel to give up all the land it captured in 1967 -- including the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem -- in exchange for Arab recognition of Israel.    However, such an exchange would be unacceptable to the vast majority of Israelis. Mr. Peres, the Israeli official who is the strongest advocate of peace talks, said on the same program that Israel's security concerns prohibit it from returning to the pre-1967 borders from which its Arab neighbors launched five wars in 40 years. &quot;I accept the principle of land for peace, but not all of the land,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
