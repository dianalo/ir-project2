(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New York state officials have decided thatnot all that glitters should be subject to sales tax.   As of Sept. 1, New York repealed its sales tax that had beenimposed on all investment transactions involving gold, silver,platinum and other precious metals. The move by Gov. Mario Cuomo andthe state Legislature came this year at the urging of the bankingand investment industry.   Under the new law, New York's sales tax won't be charged fortransactions involving $1,000 or more in precious metals forinvestment purposes only.   Sales tax is still charged on precious coins purchased forcollecting and for investment purchases under $1,000. It's alsostill charged on metals and coins from South Africa, such as theKrugerrand. The state Legislature specifically excluded them becauseof that country's racist policies, state officials said.   In New York City, where sales tax is 8\ percent, repealing thelevy is expected to boost the local metals trade. Previously,investors had been going to states where no sales tax was charged,such as Delaware and Illinois, said state Tax and Finance Departmentspokesman Paul Rickard. About a dozen other states charge no salestax.   For investors, that means they'd be able to buy metals in NewYork without the mark-up that sales tax brings.   ``Removing that barrier will have an enormous impact,'' said NinaLipton, research manager for Platinum Guild International, a NewYork City-based platinum dealers trade association. ``You can buymore. There will be more reasons to buy in New York.''   For New York dealers, that means more money. Precious metalsdealers in Washington reported a 41 percent increase in gross salesthe year after that state repealed its sales tax on gold, silver andplatinum, according to a Washington, D.C.-based dealers tradeassociation.   ``We'd expect New York dealers to experience a tremendousincrease in their sales,'' said Howard Segermark, president of theIndustry Council for Tangible Assets. ``New Yorkers are much morelikely to deal with New York firms.''   And for New York state, the change is expected to bring in anadditional $955,000 in tax revenues the first year and about$515,000 a year after that. Half that money would go to localgovernments, namely New York City.   Generally, repealing a tax means the state would lose money. ButRickard said the state stands to make money on the move because itexpects to collect more tax revenue from storage of the preciousmetals in bank vaults and other facilities.   New York wasn't seeing much in sales tax revenues from preciousmetals investments anyway because investors were buying the metalsin other states, Rickard said.   New York's action puts precious metals on a par with stocks andbonds, which had already been exempt from sales tax.   ``Now investors have a choice,'' said Luis Vigdor, executive vicepresident of MTB Banking Corp. ``They can walk into a store and taketheir Maple Leafs and platinum Koala coins home with them or theycan store them in a vault, all without penalty.''</TEXT></DOC>
