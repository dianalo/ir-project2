One study, compiled by the institute, was based on ananalysis of fatal accidents between 1985 and 1991. It showedthat driver deaths in frontal crashes were 28% lower in carsequipped with air bags, compared with automobiles with manuallap-and-shoulder belts. In all kinds of crashes, thereduction was 19%.   The other study, done by the Highway Loss Data Institute,was based on an analysis of insurance claims of driverinjuries in serious frontal crashes. It showed that driversin airbag-equipped cars were 25% to 29% less likely to havemoderate or severe injuries and 24% less likely to behospitalized than were drivers of cars with automatic belts.The study involved 1990 models involved in accidentsresulting in at least $5,000 damage to the car.   In issuing the studies, Charles Hurley, an InsuranceInstitute for Highway Safety spokesman, took aim at a recentanalysis by George Hoffer, a Virginia Commonwealth Universityprofessor. Mr. Hoffer, in examining insurance-claims data,found that of 21 car models that had air bags added asstandard equipment from 1989 to 1991, 16 recorded a higherrate of accidents with injuries than the same models withoutair bags.   Mr. Hurley complained that Mr. Hoffer's results left themistaken impression that air bags don't reduce seriousinjuries. He contended that Mr. Hoffer's analysis was skewedbecause it included all types of injuries, even minor ones,whereas air bags are designed to prevent serious injury infrontal crashes.   &quot;What air bags do is prevent the kind of injuries that youcan't repair -- head and spinal injuries and damage tointernal organs,&quot; Mr. Hurley said. Mr. Hoffer was unavailablefor comment.</TEXT></DOC>
