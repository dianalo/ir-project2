An 1/36thscale model of the BWR type reactor building, made of natural rubber,was fabricated accurately. The foundation slab was fixed with a shakingtable. Free vibration test by impulse load and forced vibration testby a shaking table in the frequency range of 2 to 30 Hz was performed.In the simulation analyses for the vibration tests on the reduced model,a lumped mass system model and a three-dimensional FEM model were used.The analytical results were studied and compared with the experimentalresults.</TEXT></DOC>
