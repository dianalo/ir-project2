The articles concernhigh-spin spectroscopy with OSIRIS, alpha and beta decay studies of neutron-deficientisotopes of tantalum and application for mass determination at the proton-dripline, rigid rotation versus shape coexistence in the N=Z=36 region, dissipationof linear momentum and energy in fusion-like reactions, orientation ofthe nuclear spin in heavy ion collisions at VICKSI energies, extremecases of the local magnetism, and most deep implantations in semiconductormaterials and structures. See hints under the relevant topics. (HSI).</TEXT></DOC>
