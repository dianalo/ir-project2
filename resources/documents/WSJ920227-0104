The model on the cover of this month's Mirabella gazesover her tattooed shoulder; a recent Vogue shows models withtemporary stenciled &quot;jewelry.&quot; Next step: department stores,says Trusk Communications, London, makers of temporarytattoos. A U.S. distributor, Milk and Honey Inc. of Santa Fe,N.M., expects its sales to double 1991 levels as the tattoosmove to big stores. The temporaries sell for $3 to $5 andlast about a week.   Real tattoos gained favor in recent years due to theunveiling of markings on celebrities like Cher. But noteveryone is convinced fakes will flourish.

Aandamp;D Christopher Ranch in Californiasays demand for fresh garlic grows by 10% a year. Restaurantsreflect the trend by buying more peeled, fresh cloves. LosAngeles's Spago Restaurant notes it made garlic a star agesago. One of Spago's favorites: a chicken entree withtwice-blanched garlic. The Stinking Rose in San Franciscodevotes its entire menu to garlic, using 500 pounds a week.   Weekend brunch at Stinking Rose offers a Garlic RamosFizz, a frothy cocktail made with orange juice, cream, egg,gin and garlic syrup.                                                                                                          GIVE US YOUR CEOS.

NASTY VS. NICE: St. Martin's Press ridicules the popular&quot;Life's Little Instruction Book&quot; with its takeoff, &quot;Life'sLittle Destruction Book.&quot; Book one lists niceties such as:&quot;Always overtip breakfast waitresses.&quot; The satire advises:&quot;Never tip more than a quarter.&quot;                                                                                                          THE BUSINESS OF GARBAGE sums up a new B.S. degree atRochester Institute of Technology in upstate New York.

PAPER MAKERS STRUGGLE with overcapacity and undersizeddemand.   Uncoated printing and writing papers are marked for aprice increase soon. List prices for linerboard (used inboxes) rise, and prices for wood pulp (the origin of allpaper) have firmed, paper makers say. But they are hardly outof the woods. Newsprint prices are still slammed by deepdiscounts and slack demand. Bowater Inc. says prices fornewsprint slip below the fourth quarter despite industryefforts to curb capacity.   International Paper Co. is increasing prices on printingand writing papers by about 8%. &quot;It's a little too early totell how much will hold,&quot; adds Dana Mead, an IP executive. AUnion Camp Corp. spokesman notes the industry will raiseprices &quot;if the economy moves ahead.&quot; Bruce Kirk, an S.G.Warburg Securities analyst, says discounts erase up to 5%from list prices.   A pickup will aid wood prices more than paper, says Mr.Kirk. At best, paper prices may rise 1% to 3% this year andwood products could jump 20%.
