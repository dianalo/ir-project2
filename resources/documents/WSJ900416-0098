At a luncheon of the Venezuelan American Association inNew York last week, Mr. Sosa Pietri said the state oilcompany is seeking to encourage foreign investment in aneffort to triple capacity in the next five years.</LP><TEXT>   The government is sponsoring a bill in Congress to permitforeign involvement in a proposed $3.5 billion liquefiednatural gas project, Mr. Sosa Pietri said. That project,which is expected to require the development of offshore gasreserves, would be an important new outlet for Venezuela's106 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.   Mr. Sosa Pietri said that five or six foreign companieshave made firm offers to join a Petroleos affiliate in theproject. A feasibility study is expected to be completed bythe end of May.   Foreign participation in the Venezuelan oil industry hasbeen strictly limited since its nationalization duringVenezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez's previousadministration. But after his re-election in late 1988,President Perez embarked on an economic overhaul packageintended to reduce the country's heavy foreign debt andstimulate the local economy. That program has includedencouraging private sector participation in key industries,allowing the market to set the exchange rate for the bolivar,and lifting price controls on many goods.   The encouragement of foreign investment in the energysector is still controversial in Venezuela, and some analystshave expressed doubts that Congress would move proposalsthrough as fast as Mr. Sosa Pietri thinks they will.   High tax rates are one obstacle to foreign investment thatthe government is hoping to alleviate. Corporations aregenerally taxed at a rate of 48%, while Petroleos strugglesunder a composite tax burden of 82%. He said Congress isconsidering legislation that would lower the corporate taxrate to 35%.   To help with plans to increase crude oil productioncapacity, Venezuela also is considering revising rules thatprevent foreign participation in the upstream sector ofVenezuela's oil industry, Mr. Sosa Pietri said. New rulescould come by mid-May, he said.   He didn't specify how the rules would be revised otherthan to say that they wouldn't include concessions, whicharen't allowed by the constitution. However, he saidPetroleos hopes for &quot;joint ventures from exploration all theway through downstream.&quot;   Venezuela also plans to expand its production oforimulsion, a bitumen and water blend that competes with coalat a price of about $5 a barrel, Mr. Sosa Pietri said. &quot;Aseries of agreements&quot; will put exports at 100,000 barrels aday by 1992, he said. That blend, developed by Petroleos andthe British Petroleum Co., will enable Venezuela to takeadvantage of its 230 billion barrels of bitumen reserves inOrinoco.   Regarding Petroleos itself, he said that there is areorganization under way to &quot;enhance the role of Petroleos asa holding company, not an operating company,&quot; and tostrengthen the role of the affiliates.   The Petroleos chief took pains to emphasize that Venezuelasees its economic future tied to the health of the economiesof the U.S., Europe, and Japan, its main markets. Priceshocks aren't in Venezuela's interest, he stressed. &quot;Webelieve in price increases . . . that go along with worldinflation levels.&quot;   Mr. Sosa Pietri said he didn't think that Venezuela'smembership in the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries would hamstring its plans to increase crude-oilproduction capacity beyond its present OPEC quota. As demandoutstrips OPEC production capacity, the need for quotas willdisappear, Mr. Sosa Pietri said.   Mr. Sosa Pietri, a Harvard University Law School graduatewho spent his career as a self-described &quot;entrepreneur inmedium-sized companies&quot; dealing with international markets,also addressed the outcry accompanying his appointment.President Perez was criticized for appointing an outsider tothe company, but Mr. Sosa Pietri said it reflected thepresident's commitment to encouraging the private sector andmaintaining Petroleos as a commercial entity.</TEXT></DOC>
