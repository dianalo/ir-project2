Angrist   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>01/31/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C1</SO><IN>FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD)</IN><LP>   For traders interested in playing the rise and, lately,the fall of the U.S. dollar, January is when to payattention.   In 10 of the past 11 years, the dollar's move in Januaryhas foreshadowed its move for the entire year. &quot;It reallypays to look at what the dollar does in January,&quot; says JamesKneafsey, president of Cambridge Financial Management Inc.,an institutional money manager.</LP><TEXT>   As measured by the dollar index -- which pegs the dollaragainst a basket of 10 other currencies, and tracks theFederal Reserve Board's trade-weighted dollar index -- thedollar has risen in seven of the past 11 Januarys, by anaverage of 3.6%, and gained an average 9.9% for all of thosesame years. In the three years the index dropped in January,by an average 2.1%, the index fell an average 15.8% for thewhole years.   The one year when the dollar index's January move didn'tmatch the full-year performance was 1985. That year, theindex rose 0.8% in January but fell 18.4% for the year.   So far this month, the index is down 0.59 point, or 0.7%,to 82.48; it fell 0.24 point yesterday.   Is making money really this easy? No, warns Kenneth Froot,an associate professor of economics at MassachusettsInstitute of Technology who specializes in internationalfinance. &quot;I wouldn't put any money on the so-called Januaryeffect,&quot; he says. &quot;I suspect that if you picked another monthbesides January, it too might work as a predictor.&quot;   But Peter Borish, director of research for TudorInvestment Corp., a commodities money manager, says his firmconsiders the January dollar effect to be an important andinteresting factor in puzzling out a trade in the dollar.It's trickier than usual in 1991, he says, because it isdifficult to tell whether &quot;the year began on Jan. 1 or Jan.16,&quot; when the Gulf war started.   Measured from Jan. 16, the dollar index has fallen 2.60points, or 3.1%.   Investors who wish to play the dollar can easily do sowith the dollar-index futures contract, and options on thatcontract, which trades on the financial-instruments divisionof the New York Cotton Exchange, known as Finex. Thesevehicles relieve investors of choosing specific currenciesagainst which to bet the dollar will move. (If a trader wantsto play a certain currency, futures on several are traded onthe Chicago Mercantile Exchange; options on several aretraded on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange.)   Finex has traded futures on the dollar index since 1985and has traded options on that futures contract since 1986.The value of the futures contract increases when the dollarincreases against the other 10 currencies. A one-point movein the index is worth $500; the minimum move is 0.01, or $5.   The index's close yesterday at 82.48 is near its 19-yearlow, set Nov. 19, 1990, of 81.56. The index's high, 162.72,was reached on Feb. 25, 1985. Index values before September1985 were derived from Federal Reserve data.   Richard Jaycobs, managing director of the Finex, says hethinks the January effect usually works for the dollarbecause &quot;a lot of company treasurers and portfolio managersmake their annual forecast for the dollar in January,institute their hedges and then, essentially, walk away fromthe market for the year,&quot; he says. If they believe the dollaris going to be strong during the year they start to buydollars, and they start to sell dollars if they believe it isgoing to be weak.   Indeed, contends MIT's Mr. Froot, essentially the dollarhas made only two long-term swings over the past 11 years:rising from 1980 to 1985 and falling since then.   But Mr. Kneafsey of Cambridge Financial says that in both1988 and 1989 the January effect forecasted a stronger dollarand in both instances the dollar rallied during the year by10% or more from the beginning of the year to its peaks.&quot;Those who say the dollar has made only an up move and a downmove in the past decade tend to ignore these two rallies,&quot; hesays.   Mr. Kneafsey adds that in 1990 he paid attention to whatthe dollar did in January but &quot;not as much as I should have.&quot;The dollar index fell 1% that month. &quot;I was allowing for aweak dollar (in all of 1990), but I must confess I wasn'texpecting an 11% drop,&quot; he says.   Adam Hewison, president of the Rich Financial Group, acurrency-trading advisory company in Shady Side, Md., saysthe dollar nowadays seems to be moving mostly sideways,&quot;leading traders to the altar and dumping them&quot; with trendsthat last for a week to 10 days. Mr. Hewison says that evenif the index finishes down for January he is expecting thedollar to rise overall this year.   The dollar-index futures contract isn't heavily traded,but trading advisers say there aren't unusual problems inexecuting orders. Trading volume last year declined 25% from1989, but activity remains more than double that of 1986, itsfirst full year of trading. Options volume is up more thanfive times the first full year of trading.   ---                  The Dollar Index    Weighting of foreign currencies in U.S. dollar index                                                                                                                 German mark           20.8%          Japanese yen          13.6          French franc          13.1          British pound         11.9          Canadian dollar        9.1          Italian lira           9.0          Netherlands guilder    8.3          Belgian franc          6.4          Swedish krona          4.2          Swiss franc            3.6                                                                                                          Source: Finex, a division of New York Cotton Exchange</TEXT></DOC>
