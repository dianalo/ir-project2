He was 82.   ``The government of Sierra Leone and all Peoples Congress Partyregret to announce the death of His Excellency Siaka Stevens,'' thegovernment said in a statement.   It said Stevens died at 1:50 p.m. (10:50 a.m. EDT) at his JubaHill home in Freetown, the capital. Stevens slipped into a coma onThursday, the second time since suffering a stroke in December. Healso had suffered partial paralysis on his left side, his doctorssaid.   There was no immediate word on funeral plans.   Stevens was one of the few African leaders ever to relinquishpower voluntarily.   He became prime minister of Sierra Leone in 1968 after amilitary coup and assumed the presidency on April 21, 1971, twodays after Sierra Leone became a republic.   Stevens was president until November 1985, when he transferredpower to his handpicked successor, Maj. Gen. Joseph Momoh, thearmed forces commander.   On a continent where leaders normally hold power for life,Stevens was only the fourth black African head of state to retirefrom office.   President Leopold Senghor of Senegal, who led his West Africannation to independence from France in 1960, resigned in 1981.Amadou Ahidjo resigned as president of Cameroon in 1982 aftergoverning for the first 22 years of independence.   Julius Nyerere of Tanzania retired as president in 1985, justdays ahead of Stevens, after 24 years in office, but held onto thecountry's most powerful political position, chairmanship of thegoverning party.   Stevens, described in ``Who's Who in Africa'' as ``a bluff,friendly, approachable, pragmatic socialist'' was born Aug. 24,1905.   He had made a name for himself and secured a following as atrade unionist when the British still ruled Sierra Leone.   As British rule came to an end, Stevens refused to join athree-party coalition that was to assume power. Instead, he formedthe opposition All People's Congress.   Stevens was on the sidelines on April 27, 1961, when SierraLeone became independent and Sir Milton Margai became the country'sfirst prime minister.   Margai died a day after the third anniversary of Sierra Leone'sindependence and was succeeded as prime minister and head of thegoverning party by Sir Albert Margai, no relation.   Stevens' party won the March 1967 general elections, but shortlyafter Stevens was sworn in as prime minister, he and otherofficials were arrested by the chief of the army.   After a month of infighting among the military that saw powerchange hands at least three times, a military-led National InterimCouncil took control and returned the leadership of the country toStevens' civilian government.   He survived two coup attempts, in September 1970 and March 1972.   Stevens was among the first voices in what has become a chorusof protests in Africa over the lending policies of theInternational Monetary Fund, which normally demands that would-beborrowers cut subsidies, devalue their currency and take otherunpopular measures.   Stevens called such moves ``political suicide.''   Sierra Leone was in an economic crisis at the time of Stevens'retirement. There were chronic shortages of fuel, food and foreignexchange and the coastal nation of 5 million people had areputation as a paradise for smugglers.   Stevens' relations with President Momoh, his former protege,became strained after an unsuccessful coup plot early in 1987. Theformer vice president and 17 others were convicted of treason inthe abortive attempt.   No charges were brought against Stevens, but several of thoseconvicted were his close associates.   Britain subsequently refused Stevens a visa.   The coup plotters were sentenced to death. Their appeal is nowbefore the high court.</TEXT></DOC>
