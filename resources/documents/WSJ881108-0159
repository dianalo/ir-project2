Winter, of course, is peak-demand time for gas. And with overall demand up sharply so far this year as exploration continues to lag, supplies are tightening and prices are rising around the country, except for the West Coast, where the weather has been unusually mild.    Indeed, the spot price of gas delivered to New York City this month is $2.38 per thousand cubic feet, up 13% from last month and 23% from November 1987. Spot prices haven't been this high since May 1986 -- and winter's fury is still weeks away.    Big industrial users are trying to offset the higher prices by switching to cheaper fuel oil earlier than usual. However, fuel switching has limited attraction to industrial companies, even when there's a big price differential between oil and gas, because gas is easier to handle and burns cleaner.    Some gas users enter the winter with more gas in storage, having increased purchases last summer at low seasonal prices. Meanwhile, some companies are managing to offset higher prices with sophisticated new gas-buying strategies.    But if demand continues strong, 1988 could see the largest one-year increase ever in gas consumption, says James Pavle, demand-analysis manager for the American Gas Association, a trade group representing 300 natural-gas distribution and transmission companies. As a result, &quot;The seasonal {price} upswing is starting sooner, and appears to be more pronounced&quot; than last year, says Robert Kalisch, director of gas supply and statistics for the association. Adds Marc Goldsmith, president of Energy Research Group Inc., in Waltham, Mass.: &quot;It's a matter of perception. The gas producer, seeing demand up and exploration down, believes now's the time to go for higher prices.&quot;    While industrial customers are scrambling, residential customers don't have too much to worry about, says Brooklyn Union Gas Co. supply planner Orlando Magnani. While prices will be &quot;slightly higher&quot; this winter compared with last, he says, residential rates generally will be insulated from the current upward price movement because much residential gas is bought under long-term contract.    To be sure, U.S. oil consumption also is up, but only by a modest 2% to 3%, not nearly enough to absorb the high level of production by the bickering members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. As a result, oil prices have plunged about 25% so far this year.    By contrast, natural-gas production, 96% of which is domestic, remains stymied, in part because energy lending has dried up following the recent wave of bank failures in Texas and Oklahoma.    While figures aren't yet available, some of this year's increased demand for gas stemmed from electric utilities' need last summer for more gas-fired generation to meet record demand. Also important has been the growing new demand for gas, especially for commercial air conditioning and cogeneration plants. Cogeneration is the simultaneous production of electricity and steam heat from a single fuel, such as natural gas.    But most of this year's surge appears attributable to a substantial 6% to 10% increase in industrial demand caused by the &quot;general buoyancy&quot; of the U.S. economy, especially among heavy gas users such as steel, chemical and food companies, says AGA's Mr. Pavle. The industrial sector accounts for 38% of all natural gas consumed in the U.S., more than any other sector.    Indeed, demand is so strong that the recent oversupply of gas on the market -- the so-called bubble -- may be fast disappearing. According to the gas association, the oversupply last year was 2.5 trillion cubic feet. This year it will drop to 1.5 trillion cubic feet, then to 0.6 trillion cubic feet in 1989, before disappearing in 1990.    Companies like James River Corp., a paper maker based in Richmond, Va., already feel that tightness. Carl Schleck, director of materials and energy procurement, says that last month he switched to fuel oil in the company's four biggest mills, weeks earlier than last year. He is currently evaluating whether to retrofit other mills so that they, too, can run on oil.    Still, Mr. Schleck fears a tough winter. &quot;Supplies are going to get kind of tight,&quot; he predicts. He says he's praying oil prices don't stage a recovery because &quot;the only thing that will hold {gas prices} down is oil.&quot;    At Consumers Power Co., in Jackson, Mich., a new buying strategy is offsetting rising prices, says Michael Morris, who's in charge of Consumers Power's natural-gas division. The new approach is generally known as &quot;portfolio&quot; buying, and a number of companies are starting to adopt it in the wake of industry deregulation.    Previously, a company usually just signed a contract with an interstate pipeline for, say, 30 to 90 days. With portfolio buying, that customer now diversifies his sources, utilizing not just pipelines but also producers and the spot market.    Consumers Power currently buys about 60% of its gas from an interstate pipeline. About 35% is bought directly from producers, while 5% is spot-market purchases. The company pays more than spot under its 20-year contract with the pipeline, in exchange for being able to adjust how much gas it buys on any given day. The higher pipeline cost is then offset by contracts at spot prices with field producers. Further offsetting is possible by buying on the spot market to take advantage of any sudden drops in price.    ---                  November Spot Gas Prices*                          NOVEMBER   OCTOBER   East Coast                $1.90     $1.65   Midwest                    1.70      1.55   Upper Midwest              1.90      1.70   West Coast                 1.65      1.70   *Prices don't include mainline transportation costs.
