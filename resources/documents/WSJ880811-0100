The suspension, ordered over the objections of the FAA, represented a victory for General Motors Corp. and its Hughes Aircraft Co. unit. Hughes lost a bitter contest for the huge contract to overhaul a key part of the nation's air-traffic control system, and last week protested to the GSA's Board of Contract Appeals that IBM had won through foul play.    The contract, the largest ever won by Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM and the largest ever awarded by the FAA, will remain suspended pending a decision by the GSA board on the merits of the Hughes protest, a GSA board spokesman said. A hearing on the merits of the case is scheduled for Sept. 9.    &quot;We're a little disappointed with the suspension,&quot; an IBM spokesman said yesterday afternoon. &quot;We maintain the protest by Hughes is without merit.&quot;    A Hughes spokesman said, &quot;We're pleased at the decision and we're looking forward to pleading the case on the merits.&quot;    The Justice Department, which represented the FAA at the hearing, argued against the suspension, saying that it would be disruptive and costly to the agency's implementation of the National Airspace System Plan. The NAS Plan is the agency's decade-long, $12 billion project to modernize the air-traffic control system, of which the Advanced Automation System is a central part.    The FAA didn't have any comment on the board's decision to suspend the contract.    The suspension will delay the start of work on a project federal officials have said is crucial to the effort to modernize the nation's antiquated system for guiding planes across the country. The so-called AAS project involves replacing the existing array of 1960s-vintage computers and radar with sophisticated tracking equipment featuring multi-colored displays that will integrate flight paths, weather information and other data.    The project's goal is to better equip air-traffic controllers to do their jobs, and thus make the skies safer, in a period when air travel has boomed. About 5,000 individual flight-controller workstations would be replaced, according to the plan.    When the contract was awarded late last month, transportation officials said IBM won mainly because it was the low bidder. Although federal officials declined to say how much higher Hughes's bid was, sources familiar with the process say the difference was close to $500 million.    But Hughes charged in its protest that IBM abused its position as a subcontractor for the Hughes system. IBM quoted prices for certain services and equipment to Hughes that turned out to be substantially higher than the prices IBM quoted to the FAA for the same items, according to the Hughes protest.    Further, Hughes asserted that IBM's proposed system was inferior to that proposed by Hughes, and didn't meet the FAA's specifications. Hughes also contends that FAA officials improperly granted IBM waivers to certain bid requirements that allowed IBM to cut its bid price. Hughes said it wasn't offered the same waivers.    The GSA announcement was made late yesterday. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, GM shares closed at $75.75, down $1.50, while IBM's shares closed at $118.875, down $2.75, in a down market. </TEXT></DOC>
