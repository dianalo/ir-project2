Consequently, the life of concrete structures is remarkablyshort and wants repair frequently. For proper management of concretestructure, a technique to predict the abrasion of concrete river structureswas studied. Generally, the abrasion resistance of concrete pitched withnatural stone is five to ten times higher than that of ordinary concrete.Furthermore, the abrasion-resistance of concrete containing a B admixtureis comparable to that of natural stone. Additionally, the abrasion coefficientof ordinary concrete C was calculated as C = 4.0 x 10{sup -5} to 5.5x 10{sup -5} while the abrasion coefficient of concrete pitched withnatural stone Co was calculated as Co = 1.0 x 10{sup -5}. In the future,many actual examples should be studied with consideration on the flowingsound characteristics of rivers. (4 figs, 6 tabs, 4 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
