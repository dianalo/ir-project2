Richard Shelby of sneaking a provision into the Continuing Resolution to postpone a court judgment against one of his campaign contributors. That judgment involved the alleged violation of oil-price-control regulations that expired seven years ago, and was based on circumstances that took place some 15 years ago. Mr. Shelby's amendment temporarily suspended collection of the judgment in that case, and earned himself your critical editorial comment. That editorial reflects a bias against both the oil industry and Congress, and compels me to note the following:   First, Sen. Shelby did not &quot;sneak&quot; this provision into law, as you suggest. Rather, the provision was offered on the Senate floor as an amendment to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. After thorough and extended debate, the amendment was adopted by a recorded vote of 70-13.    Second, you yourself characterize the legal judgment in question as &quot;nonsensical,&quot; and one that employs a &quot;novel theory.&quot; Yet, you criticize Congress for stepping in to suspend collection of that judgment while we review both its merit and its implications. If, indeed, the judgment is &quot;nonsensical,&quot; which I happen to agree that it is, why is it inappropriate for Congress to assert a right of review?    Finally, I cannot help but note the irony that seven years ago members of the Reagan administration came to town promising to abolish the Department of Energy. They did so not because they proposed to disband the nuclear-weapons production facilities, which are the single biggest budgetary component of DOE. And they did so not because they proposed to empty the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is the single biggest energy-security component of DOE. Rather, they proposed to abolish the department because of their abhorrence to oil-price and allocation controls. Yet, seven years after coming to town and 15 years after many of the alleged violations took place, that self-same administration continues to bring enforcement actions under &quot;novel&quot; theories that yield &quot;nonsensical&quot; judgments.    With the decline in world oil prices, the oil industry has suffered an economic hardship I need not detail on these pages. Meanwhile, the administration, which styled itself as the industry's protector, continues to bring enforcement actions impossible to justify in terms of law or logic. Perhaps those actions would provide a more appropriate target for your next editorial comment.    Sen J. Bennett Johnston (D., La.)    Washington</TEXT></DOC>
