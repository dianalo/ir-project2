However, this political concord is to be tested inthe coming months on two fronts: water and trade.   Drought is the more immediate challenge. Another drywinter has parched California, even as population keepsgrowing despite the recession. So residential areas face 20%water-usage cutbacks. Agriculture, which uses more than 85%of the state's water, is to be restricted, too, but the basicallocation scheme remains.</LP><TEXT>   This means that taxpayer-subsidized flows will continue tosuch commercial ends as pasture, alfalfa, cotton and ricethat are not naturally suited to most California climates andmay be in surplus nationally anyway. Sale of water rights iscatching on as a way of approximating a market, but progressis sluggish. Polls suggest urban ire has yet to turn on thefarmers, but that could change soon.   The free-trade negotiations between the U.S. and Mexicowill unfold more slowly, but again some farmers won't wearwhite hats. Not all U.S. agribusiness will oppose a loweringof barriers: grain, corn and soybean growers of the Midweststand to gain from ending the licensing of imports into anation whose &quot;ejido&quot; system of limited land tenure hurtscompetitiveness in commodity crops. Some tree fruit, such asapples, could benefit. But for the fresh vegetable and fruitfarmers of California, Florida and Texas, unleashing Mexicanproduction could uproot a protective garden of what arecalled &quot;complementary&quot; tariffs.   During the U.S. harvest season, these duties range from afew pennies a pound on Mexican tomatoes and cucumbers to anickel or dime for that amount of cauliflower or broccoli to50 cents or more for a melon. They drop off to little ornothing the rest of the year. Consumers get nicked andMexico's farm potential can't be fully realized, but vestedinterests are satisfied.   Nontariff barriers also can be a weapon in U.S.agriculture's arsenal, and a way around any trade pact.Consider a quintessential California crop: the avocado.American guacamole lovers pay as much as $2 a pound for thenutty-flavored fruit. Prices are so high that youth gangs nowraid the state's groves for their commercial contraband.   Thefts and, more important, the foibles of weather helpexplain why prices are dear, but those aren't all: ThoughMexico grows perhaps half the world's avocados, and itsMichoacan state has a capacity estimated to be double theU.S.'s, not one whole avo crosses the border legally forconsumption here. The Mexican fruit is considered infestedwith seed weevils and other pests that could devastate thedomestic yield if loosed. The ban has been in effect sincethe revolutionary days of 1914.   The true seriousness of the plague is contested, but therecan be little doubt that, if this barrier were overcomepolitically or technologically, the avocado could be a majorboon for Mexico. You wouldn't need to expand much on abillion-pound harvest to add $100 million in exports to theU.S. to the accompanying table. And the stuff is alreadybeing shipped elsewhere: Although Europe has relied mainly onIsraeli and South African suppliers, part of the Mexican cropgoes to Asia (despite the inconvenient fact that Californiawon't allow transshipments through its ports, even inair-tight packaging).   Agriculture accounts for only 10% of Mexico's exports, butthe fresh fruit and vegetable categories have shown a sizablejump. And while some in the U.S. might wish to bar thisoutput, others are seeking to profit from it. Calavo, inCalifornia's Orange County, is the state's largestavocado-packing cooperative, handling about 40% of thestate's trade. But to cover its export commitments in timesof supply stress, it has arranged for supplementary Mexicanshipments. This might be touchy with some local growers, butDan Lopez, a Calavo vice president, says &quot;packers have a moreglobal view.&quot;   Mr. Lopez suggests that &quot;big, forward-thinking growers&quot;also will rise to the possibilities of Mexican operations. Herecalls the early years of significant tomato imports twodecades ago, when marginal U.S. producers went under butstronger operators found ways, including mechanization, tocompete. Or, if they couldn't beat 'em, they joined 'em. Mr.Lopez figures that U.S. money has capitalized 90% of theMexican fresh vegetable industry.   In addition to its dramatically lower labor costs, Mexicowith proper pumps may have a water advantage in crops, suchas avocados, that require deep irrigation. But it's going tocontinue to suffer in commodity crops because of the peasantsocialism of limited property ownership. (Cotton, the largestexport harvest 25 years ago, now represents only 5% of totalagricultural shipments.) Mexican economic journalist SergioSarmiento believes that reforming &quot;land reform&quot; will be oneof President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's toughest acts.   Agriculture may stymie the U.S., too, in ratification of aMexican agreement. This is even more likely if the processdrags on into 1993, when 14 additional House membersrepresenting California, Texas and Florida will be subject tobuttonholing by one of the most powerful home-state lobbies.The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Kika de laGarza, represents a farm area of Texas. Though sympathetic toa trade pact, he assured a fruit and vegetable growersconvention in Anaheim this past weekend that any agreementwould be phased in over 10 years or longer and include a&quot;snapback&quot; of tariffs if the U.S. were inundated withimports.   U.S. growers are not just idle whiners, it must be noted.In addition to fighting a constant battle against realthreats to food safety and quality, they are confronted withbogus fears in the U.S. Were Mexican crops not up to par,their full integration into undifferentiated grocery displayscould undo hard-won gains in consumer confidence. Pesticideresidues are checked by U.S. Customs, so Mexican growers mustbe careful, but here, too, domestic producers suffer adisadvantage: They are barred from using some chemicalsregardless of residues. Additionally, they bearlabor-standard and workers-compensation burdens absent fromMexico.   Still, the U.S. must delight in Mr. Salinas making tradethe linchpin of his agenda. The gains, of course, are mutual,and they aren't limited to Americans qua consumers: Removingdisincentives to produce in Mexico and effectively freeingcapital to travel to Mexican labor, rather than vice versa,would alleviate pressure for illegal immigration and thesocial upheaval it brings. A time of drought that raisesquestions about California's own comparative advantage infarming is just when to sow the seeds of change.   ---                   Mexico's Growing Role                                                                                                          (in millions)                                                                                                                                                  JANUARY-JULY                                          1990       1989                                                                                                          Total Exports*                       $13,600     $13,300   Agricultural Exports                   1,290         963     Tomatoes                               402         160     Melons, Fresh Fruit                    139         159     Fresh Vegetables                       334         148     Cotton                                  39          86                                                                                                          *Excluding maquiladora (border) factories   Source: National Foreign Trade Bank of Mexico</TEXT></DOC>
