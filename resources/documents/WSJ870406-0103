Lenders last week were asking, on average, a 9.27% interest rate on 30-year, conventional fixed-rate mortgages, a 0.2 percentage point increase over the previous week, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.    The rate is higher than the 9.08% average rate lenders were seeking a month earlier, but still lower than the 9.99% rate of a year ago. Conventional mortgages aren't insured by the government.    Most analysts said the increase resulted from a series of recent events affecting the capital markets -- including the weakness of the dollar and last week's rise in the prime, or base, lending rate.    &quot;That may have made everybody in the market a little jittery,&quot; said Frank Nothaft, senior economist at Freddie Mac, as the mortgage corporation is known. But, he said, &quot;In terms of the outlook for the rest of the year, we don't see any violent movements in long-term lending either up or down.&quot;    A separate survey by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board showed that the average effective interest rate for conventional fixed-rate mortgages early last month was 9.48%, a slight drop from the 9.52% rate in early February and the lowest level recorded by the Bank Board in nine years. Those figures apply to single-family home mortgages maturing in 25 years or more.    Rates for adjustable-rate mortgages early last month also were lower than in early February, according to the Bank Board study. But the rate of decline was smaller than it had been through the previous year.    Lenders in early March were seeking an 8.43% average effective rate for the most popular kind of adjustable-rate mortgages -- those that restrict rate increases. That was slightly below the 8.50% rate of a month earlier. The rates for adjustable-rate mortgages without rate limits declined to 8.15% from 8.23% a month earlier.    The popularity of adjustable-rate mortgages also declined last month. According to the Bank Board, adjustable mortgages constituted just 22% of all conventional loans closed in early March, down from 29% the previous month and the lowest proportion since last June.    The low figure probably reflects the preferences of home buyers refinancing existing loans, according to Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association. &quot;People probably believe we've hit bottom and are eager to lock in the rates,&quot; he said.    Mr. Lasko added, however, that although &quot;we've seen the end of rate declines . . . I don't expect significant increases.&quot;    Martin Regalia, chief economist of the National Council of Savings Institutions, said current trends in mortgage rates mirror circumstances last spring. Falling interest rates had set off a nationwide spree of home buying and refinancing. In mid-April, weakness in the dollar precipitated a short-term rise in mortgage rates. But the dollar stabilized and rates resumed their decline.    Mr. Regalia and several other economists said that even if rates continue to rise this year, the increases are likely to be no more than half a percentage point, and may fall again by year's end.    In its report, the Bank Board said the average price of a new home dropped to $127,100 in early March, from the revised February figure of $135,600. The revised February figure was the highest recorded since the Bank Board began reporting those prices in 1973. Earlier, the board reported the February figure as $132,600.    The average term for all conventional mortgages closed in early March was 26.7 years, about the same as the previous month. Loans in March were for an average of 75% of the purchase price, a level that has held over the past three months. </TEXT></DOC>
