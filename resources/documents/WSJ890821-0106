GE said the decision could mean sales of more than $2 billion if the Navy exercises all of its purchase options.    Beginning in 1982, the Navy purchased F404 turbo-fan engines for the planes from both GE and United Technology Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitney unit, although GE garnered 90% of the business.    GE said the Navy's decision to make it the sole supplier of the engines is expected to keep its Lynn, Mass., engine plant producing the engines at the current rate of nearly two dozen each month. Under the purchasing plan approved by the Navy, GE could sell 40 to 400 of the engines annually, according to the company.    GE also received a $22 million Army contract for tactical command and control systems.    Separately, Boeing Co. received a $185.1 million Air Force contract for 50 KC-135 engine modification kits.    New Bedford Panoramex Corp. received a $22.7 million Navy contract for electronics components.    Robert E. Derecktor of Rhode Island Inc. received a $14.5 million Navy contract for two tugboats.    Space Data Corp. received a $12.1 million Air Force contract for sounding rockets. </TEXT></DOC>
