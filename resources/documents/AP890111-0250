Everett Koop said today theUnited States has undergone ``a revolution in smoking behavior'' inthe last 25 years, but young people are continuing to take up thehabit and women are quitting at a slower rate than men.   Koop, speaking at a news conference where he issued the surgeongeneral's latest annual report on smoking, said smoking rates arealso higher among blacks, blue-collar workers and less educatedpeople.   ``Because more than 50 million Americans continue to smoke andbecause of the residual increased risk of death and disease inex-smokers, smoking remains the most important preventable cause ofdeath in our society,'' he said.   ``Smoking is responsible for more than one of every six deaths inthe United States,'' he said.   ``It's no exaggeration to say that a revolution in smokingbehavior has occurred,'' Koop said. ``The gains we have made incurtailing the use of cigarettes in the United States represent oneof the greatest public health achievements of all time.''   However, he said that if current smoking trends among womencontinue, ``women will be smoking at higher rates than men beginningin the mid-1990s.''   In addition, he said, ``smoking among high school seniors hasleveled off in recent years after previous years of decline.''   ``I think some of the worrisome news is that it's continuing todecline but at a much slower rate among women. And the big thing isthat ... young kids are continuing to start almost as much as theywere 10, 20 years ago,'' Dr. Patrick Remington of the WisconsinDivision of Health, one of the authors of the report, said on ``CBSThis Morning.''   One factor in women's smoking, he said, is that ``risk-takingbehavior over the last 20 years, especially among young women, hasbecome more common. And cigarette-smoking is one risk-takingbehavior.''   Anti-smoking campaigns have been most successful in getting whitemen to put out their cigarettes, and the report calls for moreefforts aimed at women, children, minorities and high schooldropouts who are not quitting as quickly.   The annual report, issued Tuesday by Surgeon General C. EverettKoop on the 25th anniversary of the government's first such report,says the proportion of American smokers has declined from 40 percentof the population in 1965 to 29 percent in 1987.   ``These changes represent nothing less than a revolution inbehavior,'' Koop said in the report. ``Thanks to the remarkableprogress of the past 25 years, we can dare to envision a smoke-freesociety.''   However, he said, ``smokers are disproportionately found ingroups that are harder to reach, and this disparity may increaseover time. Greater effort and resources will need to be devoted toachieve equivalent reductions in smoking among those whose behaviorhas survived strong, countervailing pressures.''   The 700-page report documents changes in the 25 years since thesurgeon general's initial declaration that cigarette smoking leadsto cancer and other serious diseases.   The most significant shift has come among men _ half of whomsmoked in 1965, according to the report. By 1987, less than a thirdwere lighting up.   Women smokers declined from 32 percent to 27 percent over theperiod, the report said.   The figures also show a slow decline among blacks, 43 percent to34 percent, and virtually no change among those who never graduatedfrom high school, 37 percent to 36 percent.   Among high school seniors, daily cigarette smoking dropped from29 percent in 1976 to 21 percent in 1980 and then leveled off in the18-21 percent range for the seven years after that.   Since 1977, prevalence of smoking among high school senior girlshas been greater than that among boys of that age.   Among the other findings of the report:   _Nearly 45 percent of American adults who ever smoked have quit,though the ``quit ratio'' does not take into account the length of aquitter's abstinence.   _Smoking is responsible for more than one of every six deaths inthe United States and ``remains the single most importantpreventable cause of death in our society.''   _Between 1964 and 1987, some 789,000 smoking-related deaths wereavoided or postponed as a result of decisions to quit smoking or notto start, which the report attributes to the anti-smoking campaign.   _Four-fifths of smokers born since 1935 started smoking beforeage 21, and the proportion of people who begin smoking duringadolescence has been increasing, particularly among women. A quarterof high school seniors who have ever smoked had their firstcigarette by sixth grade and half by eight grade.   _The number of legal restrictions on children's access to tobaccoproducts has decreased over the past 24 years, and ``vendorcompliance with minimum-age-of-purchase laws is the exception ratherthan the rule.''   The first surgeon general's report concluded narrowly thatsmoking increases deaths among men and causes lung and laryngealcancer in men and chronic bronchitis in men and women.   Surgeon general reports since then have concluded that smokingincreases deaths among men and women and causes lung and laryngealcancer in both. The reports over the years also have tied smoking toheart disease, atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease, chronicobstructive pulmonary disease and low birthweight babies as well ascancers of the mouth, esophagus, bladder, kidney and stomach, cervixand pancreas.</TEXT></DOC>
