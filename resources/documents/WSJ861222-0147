On Friday, after nine months of study, the Pentagon proposed the dual-track plan to modernize its land-based nuclear weapons. Under the plan, the U.S. would build 500 mobile Midgetman missiles, and begin work on a system to insulate the 10-warhead MX missiles from attack by ferrying them in railroad cars in times of emergency.    While the new plan is sure to prove controversial in the long run, the administration's plan may defuse opposition in the short term. For one thing, the plan may enable the Pentagon to pick up some supporters for the unpopular MX by linking it to the more popular Midgetman.    Moreover, by putting off a request for more MX missiles beyond the 50 Congress already approved, the administration probably will delay for several years a new battle over that missile. A staffer on the House Armed Services Committee predicted that there won't be a fight over the controversial weapon until 1990, when the Air Force expects to seek funds for additional MXs.    Instead of asking right away for the 50 additional MX missiles it wants, the Pentagon said it will seek about $300 million to begin developing special trains to carry the 10-warhead missiles around the nation's railroad system in times of crisis. The plan stemmed from a congressional decision last year to limit the MX program to 50 missiles unless the Pentagon could come up with a new basing plan.    Under a previous plan, the Air Force was to house the first 50 missiles in underground silos scattered in western states. Under the new plan, the Air Force will keep the MX missiles at Strategic Air Command bases in the West. In times of international crisis, the missiles would be taken from the bases on specially outfitted trains &quot;and would roam the entire U.S. (rail) system,&quot; explained Air Force Brig. Gen. Charles May.    The new plan was designed to answer charges that silo-based MX missiles were too inviting a target for a first strike. Under the new plan, the missiles &quot;would be a very unattractive target for a Soviet planner because he couldn't locate them,&quot; said Gen. May.    However, the proposal to move nuclear missiles along the U.S. rail system is likely to spark political opposition, said a lobbyist for Common Cause, which leads a coalition of groups that have long opposed the MX.    The Carter administration proposed building a separate rail system for the MX missiles, but President Reagan killed the plan soon after taking office. The new plan differs from the Carter version by proposing to use the existing railroad system, and to keep the missiles on strategic bases except in times of crisis.    The Midgetman missile, which has been in research phase for several years, would also be a mobile missile. It would be transported on specially hardened trucks. The weapons system faced an uncertain future earlier this year, when some Pentagon officials said the system might be too costly to move into production.    The Air Force plans to award contracts in coming weeks to one of two industry teams that have been designing the vehicle to carry the missile. One team consists of Martin Marietta Co. and Caterpillar Tractor Co., and the other includes Boeing Co. and Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. </TEXT></DOC>
