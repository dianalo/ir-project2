Investigators said theplane's voice and flight recorders were destroyed, making it harderto find the cause of the crash that killed 24 people.   The chief investigator of the Canadian Aviation Safety Board, JoeJackson, would not rule out the possibility that snow and sleet onthe wings of the Fokker F-28 contributed to Friday's crash.   Sixty-nine people were on board the Dutch-built jet when it tookoff from Dryden for Winnipeg, Manitoba and crashed a half mile awayfrom the runway.   ``All of the bodies that were in the burned-out fuselage havebeen removed,'' said Ontario provincial police constable BillBrayshaw.   Twelve more bodies were recovered Sunday, bringing the total ofbodies recovered to 22. Two of the 47 survivors died in hospitals.   Police attributed the slow process of recovering the bodies tothe thigh-deep snow and rough terrain at the site.   A temporary morgue was set up at the hockey arena in thispaper-mill town of 6,500 people 200 miles northwest of Duluth, Minn.on the Trans-Canada Highway.   Plans were made to send the burned bodies to Toronto on Mondayfor identification.   Investigators said Sunday that the plane's two black boxes meltedin the fire that followed the crash.   ``It will make the investigation tougher,'' said Jackson. He saidthe boxes were at the tail end of the plane, away from the mainfire, and he did not know why they were so badly damaged.   As local churches in Dryden held memorial services for thevictims, Air Ontario denied allegations by some survivors that thetwin-engine jet crashed because it was overloaded or had too muchsnow or ice on the wings.   Paul McKnight, vice president of the regional commuter airlinebased in London, Ontario, told reporters the plane was notoverloaded and the pilot was experienced in flying in bad weather.   But Jackson did not rule out the possibility that the wings hadtoo much slush or snow.   ``There are indications from various sources that the wings werecontaminated with snow and slush,'' said Jackson. ``We've beentrying to find material evidence to prove there was snow and slushon the wings.''   McKnight said the damage to the plane, which broke into threepieces, was so extensive that ``it indeed was a miracle'' that 45people survived.   The plane's pilot, Capt. George Morwood, 52, of London, was oneof three crew members who died in the crash. The other crew member,a stewardess, survived.   Air Ontario said it would not release a passenger list until allthe fatalities were identified.   The last fatal crash in Canada of a regularly scheduledcommercial flight was in 1979, when a Quebecair Fairchild 27 wentdown in Quebec City, killing 17 people.   Canada's worst air disaster occurred in 1985, when 256 people,mainly American servicemen returning to Kentucky from the MiddleEast, died in the crash of a chartered DC-8 in Gander, Newfoundland.</TEXT></DOC>
