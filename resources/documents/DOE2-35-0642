The data indicatethat L 1641 is representative of a class of star-forming complexes inwhich the magnetic field has played an incidental role during the globalcloud-collapse phases. It is suggested that the magnetic field may controlthe direction of collimated mass outflows associated with young stellarobjects. 16 references.</TEXT></DOC>
