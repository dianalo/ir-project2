The bill, passed Monday by voice vote, would give theTransportation Department up to 50 days to block the purchase of atleast 15 percent of a major carrier's voting stock.   The fast action on the bill, introduced only last week, wasspurred by Donald Trump's proposed $7.5 billion takeover of AMRCorp. of Fort Worth, parent of American Airlines. But Trump saidMonday he was withdrawing his offer, although he may come backlater with another proposal.   In a letter to Rep. James L. Oberstar, chairman of the aviationsubcommittee, Trump said the perception that such legislation maybe hastily approved contributed to the collapse of the UnitedAirlines takeover attempt and Friday's disruption in the financialmarkets.   Trump also said attempts to rush legislation through Congress``cannot be in the interest of anyone but AMR executives.''   Backers of the bill, however, said the legislation was notwritten for AMR or any particular airline. Similar legislation hasalready been approved by the Senate Commerce, Science andTransportation Committee.   Despite strong support in the House Public Works andTransportation Committee, the Bush administration opposes the bill,according to a letter to Oberstar from Elaine L. Chao, deputysecretary of transportation.   She said the department already has sufficient authority to actwhen an acquisition raises questions about an air carrier's fitness.   Oberstar's bill would allow the Transportation Department toblock an airline takeover if the carrier would be financiallyweakened and safety would deteriorate, if a major reduction inassests would occur, or if control would go to a foreign interest.The full committee is scheduled to vote on the bill either today orWednesday.   ``There is a widespread feeling that leveraged buyouts ought tobe subject to review and some degree of regulation so they do notjeopardize the potential for competition in the nation's airtransportation system,'' Oberstar, D-Minn., said.   Due to recent mergers, the country's top eight airlines controlthan 90 percent of domestic air traffic, Oberstar said.   ``The traveling public cannot afford to have one of theseremaining major airlines dismantled or seriously disabled as aneffective competitor by the burden of servicing excessive debtresulting from a leveraged buyout,'' Oberstar said, adding thatCongress and the government must be vigilant in ensuring safetyisn't compromised.   Michael Kelliher, president of the Association of ProfessionalFlight Attendants, which represents the 15,000 American Airlinesflight attendants, said those employees have no desire to becomepawns in a corporate chess game.   ``Our flight attendants would strongly object ... to working ashard as we do to service inflated junk bond interest debtaccumulated for reasons contrary to keeping our airline healthy,''he said.   Also voicing support for the bill were representatives of theIndependent Federation of Flight Attendants, the InternationalAssociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the TransportWorkers Union of America and the Association of Flight Attendants.</TEXT></DOC>
