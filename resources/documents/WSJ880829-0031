Every four years, campaign memorabilia are manufactured by the truckload and scooped up by collectors eager to buy a piece of history for as little as 50 cents. Americans are apt to get a bit carried away at such times, especially in this collectible-conscious, post-Warhol era. After all, a single campaign button from 1920 sold for $33,000 in 1981.    But before you go overboard, remember Jimmy Carter. Perhaps 1,000 varieties of buttons were made during Mr. Carter's 1976 presidential campaign. One button from a Florida rally, at which Mr. Carter made a speech on &quot;ethnic purity,&quot; sold soon afterward for $250. Says David Frent, the Oakhurst, N.J., dealer who sold that button: &quot;Today I'd be lucky to get $20 for one.&quot; Most of the Carter buttons are now valued at only $2 or $3, specialists say.    At the New York factory of N.G. Slater Corp., a major maker of campaign buttons, there isn't time these days to worry about what might become a collectible. &quot;We're just supposed to produce buttons fast, at low cost,&quot; says sales manager Kenneth Cooper.    Most of Slater's buttons are ordered by wholesalers and vendors trying to come up with something that will sell. One vendor at the recent Republican convention, determined to be the first with a button showing the whole ticket, ordered Slater to make 1,000 buttons for each of 12 combinations: Bush/Dole, Bush/Kemp, Bush/Kirkpatrick, etc. After the announcement, the vendor called Slater and plaintively inquired: &quot;Who is Dan Quayle?&quot; The button company had no idea -- and no buttons.    So will buttons bearing wrong guesses at the ticket ever become collector's items? Not likely, the specialists say. And what about the several thousand &quot;Where Was George?&quot; buttons printed hastily by Slater and quickly sold out during the Democratic convention? &quot;They just won't stick,&quot; predicts Mr. Frent, the dealer. &quot;You need an historical issue, like Watergate. In five years, who will remember 'Where was George?'&quot;    In addition to the boost from this year's election, political memorabilia are also getting attention from academia. In February, the Museum of American Political Life will open on the campus of the University of Hartford. The first museum of its kind, the facility will house the largest private U.S. collection of political Americana, some 60,000 buttons, banners, posters and oddities collected by J. Doyle DeWitt, former chairman of Travelers Insurance Co. A campaign-memorabilia junkie, the late Mr. DeWitt reportedly had personal representatives scouring every convention for decades, while company agents coast-to-coast knew how much the boss appreciated obscure, local memorabilia.    &quot;He was the pioneer of this field. He got stuff you just can't find,&quot; says Edmund Sullivan, a University of Hartford professor who is curator of the new museum.    Political memorabilia are rarely traded at major auction houses, and whole shops aren't devoted to the field like with stamps and coins. Most items are picked up at flea markets and through the mail, particularly mail auctions such as those run by Ted Hake of York, Pa., and Mr. Frent, two well-known dealers. Mr. Hake has even compiled an encyclopedic three-volume price list for political buttons.    Collectors, who say their ranks are growing, also rely heavily on the nation's largest organization devoted to political memorabilia, American Political Items Collectors of San Antonio, Texas. For $20 a year, members get regular newsletters with historical articles and dates for &quot;swap-meets&quot; at which items are traded. The group, which has been around since 1945, has about 2,500 members and 40 chapters, divided either geographically or by specialty. (The Kennedy collectors form the biggest chapter.)    Collectors of political ephemera tend to share a passion for history and, since the vast majority of the items sell for pocket change, it's an area still dominated by hobbyists, as opposed to hard-nosed investors.    &quot;The charm of this hobby is that you can own something almost 100 years old, a chunk of history in good condition, for $10,&quot; says Mr. Hake.    Joseph Hayes, a management analyst with the U.S. Army Health Services Command in San Antonio started collecting after working on Robert Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. Joseph Jacobs, a Chicago labor lawyer who boasts the largest Franklin Delano Roosevelt collection, began it in 1940 because &quot;I was so enthusiastic about his philosophy of government.&quot; (He was the one who paid $33,000 for a one-of-a-kind 1920 Cox-Roosevelt button; the high price wasn't helped by the fact that Malcolm Forbes Jr. was bidding, too.)    Most serious collectors pick a specialty, say, items about an individual president or an issue like abolition. Ronnie Lapinsky Masella, a New York stockbroker, has amassed 5,000 items dealing with women's issues beginning in 1880.    Specialists also look for rarity and quality. Collector Robert Fratkin, a vice president of Shearson Lehman Brothers, McLean, Va., and ex-president of American Political Items Collectors, looks for celluloid buttons rather than tin ones, because they are produced in much smaller quantities. Historically, buttons with pictures of both candidates are considered more valuable, and it is far better, Mr. Fratkin says, to pick up items &quot;used one time on a specific occasion,&quot; rather than mass-produced general buttons.    In this election year, Nancy Dunnan, a New York financial adviser, suggests the limited edition, offbeat buttons from various state delegations, such as &quot;Ducactus&quot; buttons from Arizona.    ---   Political Plums    Some coveted political memorabilia   1.George Washington, inaugural button: $1,200 to $1,500.     2.
