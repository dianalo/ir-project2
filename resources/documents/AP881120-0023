Pete Domenici, R-N.M.   ``The hysteric markets and those who insist on new taxes aretrying to give him (Bush) the bum's rush and panic him into startingformal kinds of meetings. I don't think he ought to do that,''Domenici said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''   Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., chairman of the House Budget Committee,said on the same program that Bush needs to take several stepsquickly, including convening a meeting of his administration'sprospective economic advisers and members of Congress.   On Saturday, Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., said in the weeklyDemocratic radio address that Bush himself should meet with membersof Congress before his Jan. 20 inauguration to search for a commonground in efforts to reduce the deficit.   ``I totally disagree this president-elect has to do anythingbefore he's sworn in,'' Domenici said Sunday. ``In fact, I don'tthink he has to do anything very quickly.''   The senator said he believes Bush will keep his campaign promiseto reject any tax increases, and said he should choose appointees tothe bipartisan National Economic Commission who strongly agree withthat position. Bush is to fill two seats on the commission, createdafter last year's stock market crash to recommend ways to lower thedeficit.   Gray praised Bush for expressing his determination to deal withthe deficit, but said he should go further by appointing othermembers of his economic team, fill vacant seats on the deficitcommission, subject his own budget proposals to Congress and havehis economic advisers meet with congressional leaders.   Gray said Democrats would prefer to reduce the deficit withoutraising taxes, but the figures don't add up to enough money fordefense, Social Security, interest on the national debt, education,the war on drugs and all the other programs Bush supported duringthe presidential campaign.</TEXT></DOC>
