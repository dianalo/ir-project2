(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 76-day-old strike against Pittston CoalGroup spread to Kentucky today, and a wildcat walkout by more than20,000 miners in support of the Pittston employees expanded to atleast nine states.   Terry Varney, spokesman for a United Mine Workers local, saidproduction stopped at three Eastern Coal Corp. mines in Kentucky asof 12:01 a.m. Eastern is a Pittston subsidiary. About 200 peoplework at the mines, Varney said.   The union had predicted the Kentucky strike after 1,600 Pittstonminers walked off the job in April in Virginia and West Virginia.   A sympathy strike begun on June 12 idled more 20,000 UMW membersas of Sunday in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee,Indiana and Kentucky. This morning, at least 2,000 miners in Ohio,Illinois and Alabama joined the strike.   Unlike the Pittston walkout, the sympathy strike has not receivedthe public blessing of the UMW, but some union members said thewalkout is being directed by UMW President Richard Trumka. He hasbeen unavailable for comment for days.   In Ohio, workers at three Southern Ohio Coal Co. mines employing1,100 union miners didn't show up, said Terry Trimper, a companyspokeswoman. In Illinois, AMAX Coal Co. said none of its 655 minersat its Wabash Mine showed.   In Alabama, Drummond Coal Co. said three-fourths of its 1,900union members on its late Sunday shift did not show, and Jim WalterResources Inc. said its underground operations in two counties wereidle. The number of strikers was not given.   There was no comment this morning from the United Mine Workers.Trumka and UMW spokesman Joe Corcoran did not immediately returncalls.   Union officials in Nova Scotia and Alabama have said miners therealso were likely to strike. And in Indiana, Old Ben Coal Co. todayasked a federal judge to order its 350 miners back to work. Thejudge did not immediately rule.   As of Sunday, all of Indiana's 1,750 union miners were off thejob for the first time in eight years, while in West Virginia abouttwo-thirds of the state's 24,000 miners are on a sympathy strike. Atleast 2,500 wildcat strikers were idled in Pennsylvania, 790 inVirginia, 1,270 in Kentucky and 200 in Tennessee.   The wildcat strikers say they are off the job to show support forthe strike against Pittston, which last week declared negotiationsat an impasse. That move allows Pittston to implement its latestcontract offer.   At issue in the Pittston strike are benefits and wages. Minersfear that Pittston's demands, if successful, will be applied byother U.S. companies.   A major rallying point for the strikers is the jailing of threeUMW leaders who helped organize the Pittston walkout.   As the Eastern Coal strike began, a picket line was set up at thegates of the company's main coal production facility at McAndrews.About 20 miners milled about a freshly constructed picket shack.   A State Police cruiser drove by, and the troopers asked theminers how they were doing and if they had any hot coffee. Thepolicemen left, wishing the miners good luck.   All miners wore camouflage and had yellow ribbons pinned to theirshirts in a show of solidarity.   Local 5737 President Glenn Stanley said he received a telegramand a phone call from Trumka on Sunday authorizing the local tostrike.   According to Stanley, Trumka said it was time to strike Easternbecause the company reportedly was ready to ship a large order ofcoal.   Eastern did not immediately a call this morning.</TEXT></DOC>
