The president, in submitting his 1989 budget to Congress, saidhe will ask lawmakers to make tax-exempt the interest on savingsbonds that are redeemed to finance post-secondary education. Thiswould cost the government an estimated $10 million during the 12months beginning next Oct. 1.   The tax benefit would be targeted for lower- and middle-incomefamilies and would be eliminated as earnings exceed a certain level.   ``The costs of post-secondary education have increasedsubstantially in recent years, often faster than inflation,''Reagan said in his written message to Congress. ``As a result,parents may have difficulty bearing these costs unless theyestablish a savings program for this purpose when their childrenare young.''   The biggest new revenue-raiser recommended by the presidentwould require all state and local government employees to pay theMedicare hospital-insurance tax. The tax, which most Americansalready pay, is 1.45 percent of the first $45,000 earned. The levyis collected as part of the Social Security tax.   The tax already is collected from state and local workers hiredafter March 31, 1986. Reagan said workers hired before that datealso should be required to pay in order to reduce a drain on theMedicare system.   The change, which Congress has rejected several times, wouldbring in $1.6 billion in 1989.   Repeal of the ``windfall-profit'' tax on the oil industry, whichCongress also has rejected, is included in the president's budget.Reagan says the tax, which was imposed when oil prices were rising,is an unnecessary paperwork burden on the industry at a time ofdeclining prices.   The oil industry would get a $52-million tax break under thebudget if Congress goes along with a proposed modification of rulesaffecting the depletion allowance.   Other revenue proposals:   _A permanent tax break for owners of shares in mutual funds, whowould be affected by a 1986 tax change that limits miscellaneousitemized deductions to those that exceed 2 percent of adjustedgross income. Congress voted an exception to mutual-fund deductionsfor 1987 only.   _Permit U.S. companies to allocate at least two-thirds of theirtotal research and development expenditures to domestic operations.This would save them about $600 million in 1989.   _Make permanent a temporary tax credit for research andexperimentation, saving U.S. companies $400 million next year.   _Repeal a provision imposed by Congress that reduces air-tickettaxes and aviation-fuel levies when federal spending for airportand airways imporovements drops below a certain level.   _Increase user fees incurred in federal regulation of nuclearpower plants.   _Change the method of calculating a special fee on importedproducts, costing the government about $100 million next year. Themodification of the 0.17-percent fee is necessary to bring theUnited States into compliance with international trade agreements.</TEXT></DOC>
