In the Soviet Union, the Communist Party daily Pravda published alengthy article titled ``Reagan's Best Role'' that credited Reaganwith becoming more of a realist than an ideologue as his termprogressed.   Correspondent Gennady Vasiliev noted that Reagan, ``according tothe general view, was not distinguished by the strong intellect ofRoosevelt, the broad education of Kennedy, or even Carter's capacityfor work.''   But his opponents time and again underestimated him, Vasilievsaid, and Reagan was leaving office a popular and successfulpresident.   The Japan Times hailed Reagan as the ``man of the decade,'' andan Australian newspaper called him ``a hard act to follow.''   In the Netherlands, the Rotterdam newspaper Algemeen Dagblad saidthe United States ``found a much-wanted anchor in Reagan'sstraightforwardly conservative ideology of patriotism, militarymight and economic recovery.''   In Managua, however, the leftist Nicaraguan government plannedparties and parades to usher out Reagan, whose administrationfinanced anti-government rebels since 1981. And in Jordan, PLOofficial Khaled al-Hassan called Reagan an ``illiterate'' who knewnothing about international problems.   ``The workers will show their ingenuity to mock imperialism andthe reactionaries in this country,'' the state Voice of Nicaraguasaid Thursday.   The Nicaraguan government said it hoped normal relations with theUnited States could be restored after George Bush took office.Al-Hassan agreed, saying, ``Bush knows ... a lot. A knowlegeable manwith consultants is more useful than an illiterate withconsultants.''   In Yugoslavia, the leading daily Politika said today that``Reagan will be remembered as an unmatched political seducer''whose rhetoric Bush will never be able to match.   West Berlin's mayor, Eberhard Diepgen, sent Reagan a letter ofthanks for his demand that the Berlin Wall be torn down.   ``Your impressive words during the event of the 750th anniversary(of Berlin) before the Brandenburg Gate, when you so forcefullydemanded overcoming the division and tearing down the Wall, remain aspecial memory for Berliners,'' the letter said.   While Bush takes over the reins of power, Reagan plans to saddlea gift from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.   Reagan put the cart before the horse Wednesday when he announcedthe gift would be sent to his ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif.Canada delayed confirming it until late Thursday _ possibly becauseof a U.S. law preventing presidents from accepting gifts while inoffice.   In France, the daily Liberation devoted its entire front page toa photo, taken from the rear, of Reagan and his wife Nancy ridingoff on their horses. ``So long, Reagan,'' read the caption.   In London, Mrs. Thatcher bestowed verbal bouquets on Reagan in anote made public one day before Bush's inauguration.   ``You have been a great president, one of the greatest, becauseyou stood for all that is best in America,'' she said.   ``Your beliefs, your convictions, your faith shone througheverything you did. And your unassuming courtesy was the hallmark ofthe true and perfect gentleman. You have been an example and aninspiration to us all.''   In Sydney, The Daily Telegraph gave Reagan a similar send-off.   ``His personal optimism ushered in a new era. He gave America anew sense of dignity and was an effective morale-boostingcheerleader.   ``History will be kind to Mr. Reagan ... He will be a hard act tofollow.''   In Tokyo, the Japan Times said Reagan reigned over a ``fabulouslylucky time'' for the industrialized world.   The English-language daily also credited Reagan for reviving``America's morale after the disasters of Watergate, Vietnam, twooil crises and the humiliation of the Iran hostage affair. ``As aresult, we think that Mr. Reagan should be named `man of thedecade.'''   Israel and Arab commentators appeared to agree the change wasIsrael's loss and the Arabs' gain.   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said he believed Bush``understands the Palestinian problem and has good intentions.''   The English language Jerusalem Post said Bush, ``has never had anemotional pro-Israel record like his predecessor, who has spoken ofIsrael with great warmth.''   Pope John Paul II sent his greetings to George Bush and expressedhopes the new president would spare no efforts in building worldpeace.   ``On the occasion of your inauguration as president of the UnitedStates, I wish to renew my greetings and prayerful best wishes toyou and your family and to all the American people,'' said atelegram from the Vatican.</TEXT></DOC>
