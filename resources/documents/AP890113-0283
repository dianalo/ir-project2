The companies said their strategies to focus on ``downstream''investment _ the businesses that refine and market chemicals,gasoline and other products _ were based on projections for weak oilprices into the 1990s.   The downstream, or exploration and production, operations of mostmajor oil companies have been hurt in recent years because of lowoil prices. Despite a sharp rise in crude prices since November whenthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to reduceits output, many analysts and oil company executives have remainedskeptical that the gains would last beyond June, when the agreementexpires.   Several oil companies have said recently they would reducedomestic operations and concentrate on foreign exploration becauseit is cheaper and the potential for finding oil is greater. In 1988,U.S. oil production fell by an estimated 1 million barrels a day.   Chevron, the fourth-largest oil company, said Friday it willspend $3.8 billion in 1989, $400 million more than in 1988,excluding its $2.5 billion acquisition of Tenneco oil and gas assetsin the Gulf of Mexico.   Chevron said it would invest $350 million for chemicalproduction, up 50 percent from last year, and $1.1 billion forrefining, marketing and pipeline operations, 25 percent more than in1988.   The San Francisco-based company said its production budget wouldremain virtually unchanged at $2 billion, but with increasedinvestments in Africa, Indonesia and the North Sea.   Meanwhile, Phillips Petroleum said it would boost its capitalspending 8 percent to $975 million, concentrating on refiningoperations and foreign exploration and production.   The largest increase in the budget comes in the company'spetroleum refining, marketing, petrochemicals and plastics business_ up from $330 million in 1988 to $389 million in 1989.   The Bartlesville, Okla.-based company is expanding itsmanufacturing capacity in several plastics lines at its Houstonchemical complex.   Of the $406 million budgeted for worldwide exploration andproduction projects, $228 million is earmarked for overseas wherethe company said it sees strong potential for adding reserves in alow oil and gas price environment.   The foreign exploration and production budget of $228 million isan increase from $159 million in 1988. Domestic exploration andproduction was budgeted at $178 million for the year, down from $241million.</TEXT></DOC>
