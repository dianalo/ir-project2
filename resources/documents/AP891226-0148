But forutility workers like Kevin Quinn, who says he was exposed toasbestos on the job, the damage may already have been done.</TEXT><BYLINE>By BETH J. HARPAZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Kevin Quinn's father began working forConsolidated Edison in the 1940s, when asbestos was stillconsidered a miracle fiber and no regulations governed its use.   William Quinn died in 1980 of cancer linked to asbestos.   His son was hired by the same utility in 1979. In the yearssince his father first came in contact with asbestos, numerous lawshad been passed to protect workers from what was now acknowledgedas a prime health risk.   But in 1987, Quinn says, he was working at a plant whenasbestos-covered doors were removed from boilers and dropped to thefloor. The doors remained for weeks while workers went about theirduties without protective gear amid clouds of asbestos dust, hesays.   ``I used to walk past that area every day,'' he says. ``Theytold us it was safe. And it turns out it wasn't.''   Now, Quinn has joined 180 co-workers and the EnvironmentalProtection Agency in suing Con Ed, charging that he was exposed tothe same material that killed his father.   Eighteen years after passage of the first federal law regulatingasbestos, thousands of workers _ at utilities like Con Ed, and inother industries where asbestos was used as an insulator _ stillface its effects.   ``We are talking to people who are extremely surprised thatasbestos is still a problem,'' said Heather Maurer, executivedirector of Asbestos Victims of America. ``But the incidence ofasbestos disease is on the increase instead of the decrease,despite restrictions that have been applied to make the use ofasbestos safer.''   A recent union-sponsored screening of 538 Con Edison workersfound that 20 percent had either scarred lungs or mesothelioma, anasbestos-caused cancer of the lining of the abdomen or the lungs.   Since 1987, Con Ed has been cited by the Occupational Safety andHealth Administration for more than a half-dozen alleged violations_ mostly failure to monitor the level of asbestos fibers in the air_ at the Indian Point nuclear plant in Buchanan, a plant inAstoria, Queens, and at Quinn's 74th Street plant in Manhattan.   Some allegations are still under investigation, some have beencontested and dropped by OSHA, and Con Ed settled others by payinga fine.   ``Prior to 1973, we didn't know what the asbestos risks were,''said Con Ed spokeswoman Rosalie Zuckerman. ``We're not denying thatprior to that time, there was exposure. But now that we're aware ofit, whenever we do any asbestos work, we follow all theregulations.''   She added that since 1973, the company has had two medical vansvisiting Con Ed plants, carrying X-ray machines to test forasbestos scarring.   She would not comment on Kevin Quinn's suit. But Quinn says thecompany was negligent in 1987, when he was exposed. The workers, hesays, were kept in the dark.   ``We didn't realize we were working around asbestos 'til a shopsteward took an air sample to the White Lung Association,'' he said.   Because asbestos cancers can take 20 to 35 years to develop,workers like Quinn who believe they have been exposed recently maynot become sick until the year 2020. And people who were exposed toasbestos in the 1950s, '60s and '70s are just now getting sick.   A study by Dr. Irving Selikoff, perhaps the world's most notedasbestos researcher, and his colleagues at the Mount Sinai Schoolof Medicine projects that asbestos cancer rates won't peak until1992 and won't drop off significantly until after the year 2000.   Smoking exacerbates the risk of asbestos-related lung cancer,which is incurable in 70 to 95 percent of cases, said Dr. StephenLevin, who works with Selikoff. Mesothelioma is always fatal.Asbestos exposure also increases the risk of colon cancer, whichhas an 80 percent cure rate if caught early.   The study predicts that 9,739 deaths from asbestos exposure willbe recorded in 1992 in just 11 industries, including utilities,construction, car and railroad engine repair, shipbuilding, andasbestos manufacturing.   Many Con Ed workers fear they might surface among thosestatistics:   _Gene Duffy, 46, has worked for Con Edison for 25 years. Hischest X-rays show lung scarring; he often has trouble breathing.Duffy said he can't even cut his lawn without taking a rest halfwaythrough to catch his breath.   _Artie Sagevick, 58, a 31-year veteran. He gave up smoking 25years ago, but he has ``coughing fits 15 minutes at a time a coupleof times a day.''   _Says Steven Amato, a 21-year employee: ``If you had to do astrenuous job, go up and down stairs, I could not do it. In thewintertime, I throw the phlegm all day long. ... I'm 51 years oldand I feel like an old man.''   All three want compensation from Con Ed, more help from theirunion, and along with many of their co-workers, they are suingasbestos manufacturers.   Lawyer Chris Placitella is handling similar suits by 130 Con Edworkers. His firm represents 3,300 additional workers from otherutility companies who are involved in similar suits, and the numberof plaintiffs rises daily.   Con Edison has other asbestos-related worries. City officialshave raised concerns about public exposure to asbestos from Con Edaccidents. In several recent incidents, asbestos insulation wrappedaround underground Con Ed steam pipes has blown off when the pipesor nearby water mains burst.   One explosion killed three people and contaminated Manhattan'sentire Gramercy Park neighborhood with asbestos, forcing hundredsof people to relocate.   Con Ed was faulted for failing to report the presence ofasbestos for several days, which delayed the cleanup and increasedhealth risks. Other accidents contaminated streets and subways.   The city Department of Environmental Protection has called onfederal officials to come up with new techniques to deal with theseoutdoor and underground emergencies, since the usual procedureshave not always applied.   Most asbestos products will be taken off the U.S. market under athree-stage EPA ban that begins in 1990 and ends in 1997. Advocatesfor asbestos victims applaud the ban but wish more were being done.   Asbestos manufacturers have filed a lawsuit challenging the ban,claiming today's products are safe because the fiber is encased inhard materials like cement and won't deteriorate.   Whether or not the manufacturers are successful, AFL-CIOoccupational safety expert Peg Seminario predicts, ``It's going tobe some time before our asbestos problems are over.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
