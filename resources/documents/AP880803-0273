The Senate approved a joint resolution Tuesday to extend acooling-off period in the railroad's dispute with the UnitedTransportation Union for 36 days until Sept. 9. The House has notvoted on the matter.   ``We are aware of what the Senate did,'' spokeswoman LeslieCleveland said today from Candamp;NW headquarters in Chicago. ``But untilthe House takes action, we have to go on the assumption that we'regoing to implement our work rules and there will be a strike.''   The union said it would strike at 12:01 a.m. Thursday if thecompany, a subsidiary of the Chicago-based CNW Corp., carries outits threat to cut the size of its train crews in half and eliminatehundreds of jobs.   A walkout not only would disrupt freight service but would haltoperation of Candamp;NW commuter trains which carry more than 40,000passengers daily in the Chicago area.   Although House leaders had not scheduled a vote on theresolution by late morning, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois was notruling out action before the strike deadline, a spokesman for theIllinois Democrat said today.   ``Paul has been meeting with Speaker Jim Wright and other keyHouse members and is still hopeful the House might vote today,''spokesman David Carle said. ``If not today, then tomorrow.''   Simon said he introduced the measure ``to see that we avoid whatwill hurt everyone _ management, labor and the whole Chicago area.''   A spokesman for Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., was less optimisticthan Simon, saying the House probably would not act on the bill intime to prevent a walkout.   Porter's press aide, Dave Kohn, said the House leadership hadnot scheduled action on the bill until Thursday, after the strikewas to begin.   ``Apparently, the leadership does not want to pre-empt theunion's right to strike,'' Kohn said. But if the House acts on thebill later Thursday, he said, the strike could be over in a matterof hours.   Company officials have already said they expect a strike tooccur, even if the cooling-off period is extended. President Reaganhad imposed an initial 30-day cooling-off period last month.   ``It definitely appears this is ultimately going to result in astrike,'' said James Foote, an assistant vice president forcommunications of CNW Corp. ``No further discussions were held(Tuesday with union officials) nor are they planned. We made acompromise offer yesterday which we thought was extremelyreasonable and which they rejected.''   Foote said the company was disappointed by the Senate action.   The railroad, which has 8,000 employees, originally proposedcutting most of its four-person train crews in half to save $51million a year.   The presidential emergency board proposed eliminating 700brakemen jobs instead of the 1,150 cuts planned. Managementaccepted that proposal Monday, but union officials have rejectedthe offer.   The railroad has said it plans to continue its freightoperations _ which are 95 percent of its business _ in case of astrike, but expects at least some temporary disruptions.   Foote has estimated that the company could operate enough trainsto generate 80 percent of its normal revenue on the first day of astrike.</TEXT></DOC>
