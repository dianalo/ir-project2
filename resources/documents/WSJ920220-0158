ATandamp;T Chairman Robert Allen, testifying before the HouseJudiciary Committee's economic and commercial law panel, saidATandamp;T would support comprehensive legislation. He urged thelawmakers to prohibit the seven regional Bell phone giantsfrom providing long-distance service and manufacturingtelecommunications gear until they have significantcompetition in providing local phone service. The Baby Bellsnow handle more than 99% of local telephone traffic in theirterritories.</LP><TEXT>   In his testimony, Mr. Allen asserted that the JusticeDepartment &quot;has lost its memory and its compass&quot; and that itcan't be trusted to uphold the restrictions on the BabyBells. He cited requests for consent decree waivers-whichreceived Justice Department support-that could give the Bellssome latitude to enter the manufacturing and long-distancebusinesses.   The chairman of the panel, Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas),indicated that legislation may be introduced soon. But whatprovisions would be included is uncertain.   For the first time, ATandamp;T has joined a coalition ofnewspapers, consumer groups, manufacturing groups andinformation providers who have called for comprehensivelegislation that would curb the Bells' ability to enter newmarkets.   Last summer, the federal court here allowed the Bells toenter the information services business. Since then,newspaper groups and information providers have been pushingfor legislation that would bar the Baby Bells from owning thecontent of computerized information services they carry overtheir networks.</TEXT></DOC>
