Viscount Althorp, 25, and his wife, the former VictoriaLockwood, 24, said events and remarks attributed to them weremanufactured.   In an interview on ``Hard News,'' a Channel 4 television programabout the news industry, Viscountess Althorp said tabloidjournalists harassed her and her friends and invaded their privacy.   ``I think they're really totally insensitive, evil, evilpeople,'' she said. ``I don't know how they go home to their wivesand children and talk about their day with a clear conscience andhave any self-esteem or self-respect.''   Viscount Althorp, who works as a reporter for the NBC-TV show``Today'' as Charles Althorp, said of the tabloid reporters: ``Theywere not content with the story as it stood. They wanted to make itjuicier, nastier.   ``Everyday people are bruised by the press and they haven't gotany recourse to speak out, and I am doing this because I think Iought to and because I am in the position to do so.''   His wife criticized a cover story in the Sunday Mirror of Sept.10, on which the headline was ``Charlie's Bride in Sexy Clinch withEx-Lover.''   ``If I were going to smooch with an ex-flame, I certainlywouldn't do it in a nightclub in front of everybody,'' she said.   A spokesman for Maxwell Communications, which owns the SundayMirror, said company officials had not seen the program and couldnot comment until they had done so.   Althorp said he once found a photographer hiding in bushesbeside his house when he and Miss Lockwood were outdoors.   ``We had a drink on the lawn and I heard this clicking from abush at the end of the garden,'' he said. ``So I raced there and Ihauled out this photographer who was weighed down with cameras.''   Darius Guppy, the couple's best man, said a News of the Worldjournalist tried to get him to agree that the bachelor night party``degenerated into an orgy.''   ``They were interested in inventing a story that wouldcompromise Lord Althorp, which I think was unforgivable,'' he said.   Stuart Kuttner, the News of the World managing editor, said hispaper was interested in covering the Althorp engagement andwedding, but ``the allegation that the paper was interested ininventing a story that would compromise Lord Althorp is utterlywithout foundation.''   ``Indeed, the claim does not bear examination, since to invent,without foundation, a compromising story would expose the paper tothe risk of legal proceedings which it would be unable to defend,''Kuttner said. ``In short, this serious charge is wholly rejected.''</TEXT></DOC>
