Hunt (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo indicated that he probably won't endorse a Democratic presidential candidate until after the final June primaries and dismissed suggestions that he had been leaning toward backing Michael Dukakis.    &quot;If I endorse someone it means I oppose everyone else,&quot; the governor said in a telephone interview. &quot;If my purpose is to get the strongest possible Democratic nominee . . . that might weaken my capacity to help.&quot;    Gov. Cuomo angrily denied rumors that he is holding off endorsing anyone in the hope that a brokered convention would turn to him. &quot;Those who say that never believed me when I said that I wouldn't run, and to say an endorsement of another candidate now affects my position (on running) is irrelevant and insulting.&quot; He reiterated that he believes the nominee will be someone who has contested in the primaries.    Although Mr. Cuomo insisted the value of his backing is overrated -- &quot;my endorsement won't mean anything to anyone except me&quot; -- his support certainly would be a critical plus for any candidate in the important New York primary on April 19. New York will send 275 delegates to the Democratic convention, or almost 7% of the total delegates. In addition, a decision by the New York governor to sit on the sidelines until after the primaries may send a signal to other politicians to stay open, increasing the likelihood that no one will come close to wrapping up the nomination by June.    The influential New York Democrat pointedly praised both the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore but was more detached in evaluating Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis. &quot;The starting point of an endorsement has to be that you're convinced that one of them is better than the others. I am not convinced. Mike (Dukakis) hasn't made that case yet.&quot;    On domestic issues, he said Jesse Jackson &quot;has the single most identifiable and attractive message&quot; of any candidate in the field: &quot;When he talks about big corporations going to Taiwan and paying lower wages and then selling goods back to us, people nod their heads in agreement.&quot; The other contenders, he said, should conclude that Mr. Jackson's &quot;message is more captivating&quot; than theirs. &quot;We (the Democrats) can't win without a message.&quot;    Gov. Cuomo disagreed that Sen. Gore, as a Southerner, lacked appeal in New York, noting that the Democratic speaker of the New York Assembly, Melvin Miller, is considering endorsing the Tennessee Democrat. Under the right circumstances, he said, Sen. Gore could &quot;do extremely well&quot; in New York.    Gov. Dukakis's emphasis on his competence has served him well, Mr. Cuomo said, but then noted, &quot;he has to add something now. He needs to talk about specific positions. He has to go beyond the Massachusetts miracle. I think Michael knows that and you'll hear it.&quot;    He dismissed as inaccurate stories that suggested he was planning to endorse Gov. Dukakis, generally considered to be the front-runner and most likely nominee -- &quot;I never said anything like that.&quot; And he took strong exception to a column yesterday by respected Boston Globe columnist David Nyhan suggesting that an unwillingness to endorse the Massachusetts governor reflects either a deal Mr. Cuomo cut with the Rev. Jackson or his desire to have the nomination himself: &quot;That's just cheap Boston politics.&quot;    He also insisted that the political situation was much different from the one in 1984 when he got behind former Vice President Walter Mondale's candidacy and helped him win an important victory in the New York primary. &quot;I had a presumptive candidate in 1984 and we had a team that we put together for him. This year we have no presumptive candidate.&quot; Further, he added that he has lost his most important political advisers, especially his son Andrew who's in private business, and thus doesn't have the political resources that he had four years ago to direct a campaign.    Mr. Cuomo left open a small possibility that he could endorse someone before next month's New York election. &quot;If I conclude there is one person who clearly is the best, who clearly would make the best president, who clearly is going to be the nominee and then I can give him a needed boost then maybe I'll endorse. But I can't imagine that. I don't have that kind of clout.&quot;    Even though his posture seems certain to fuel more speculation about a brokered Democratic convention, he insisted that's the last thing he wants. &quot;We must not have a brokered convention,&quot; he warned and suggested that after the primaries are over he may get together with other Democratic governors who've stayed neutral to help prevent &quot;a fractious battle.&quot;    While Gov. Cuomo feels the Democratic situation has yet to sort out, he does see one bit of good news for his party: the almost certain nomination of Vice President George Bush by the Republicans. &quot;Any Democrat, in my opinion, beats Bush,&quot; he declared. &quot;He has the Reagan record without the Reagan charisma. I can't think of a more vulnerable situation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
