One hundred and seventy schools took part in thenational survey using the plastic detectors. Pupils sited the detectorsto measure both {alpha}-radioactivity in the soil and activity from radongas emanating from the soil. Results of the survey are presented to givea national picture of the measured soil and radon activities. (U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
