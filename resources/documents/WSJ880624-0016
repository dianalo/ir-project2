Carafate, which has been marketed in the U.S. by Marion since 1981, is currently used to treat duodenal ulcers.    Under the agreement, Madison, N.J.-based Schering-Plough will be a collaborative partner in developing over-the-counter forms of Carafate, preparing data for submission to the Food and Drug Administration and jointly marketing Carafate as an over-the-counter product, following marketing approval. Additional products will be considered for exclusive or joint marketing as part of the agreement.    A spokesman for Kansas City, Mo.-based Marion, which makes medical products, said the over-the-counter versions won't be marketed as a treatment for ulcers, but for gastric disorders, such as upset stomachs and heartburn. However, he said, physicians may recommend the products for ulcers. </TEXT></DOC>
