It is possible to suggest that missile defenses may make asignificant contribution to US national security. Given this proposition,the dissertation follows the analysis as outlined: (1) The original ABMdebate of the late 1960s is reviewed with respect to the arguments ofproponents and opponents of the ABM. This debate led the US to acceptthe dominance of offensive nuclear forces in the nuclear balance. (2)While the US had foresworn working on ballistic-missile defenses duringthe 1970s, the strategic nuclear balance and foundations of deterrencehave changed. (3) US strategic nuclear policy has evolved since the late1960s to incorporate three major policy schools: assured destruction,countervailing, and nuclear war-fighting. Ballistic missile defensesfit with these policies in quite different ways. (4) US strategic offensivenuclear forces may be altered significantly by the deployment of a missiledefense. (5) A US missile defense could effectively break up the ABMTreaty and spell an end to the arms control process. On the other hand,the SDI also may serve as an impetus to a new arms control treaty whichincorporates reductions in offensive nuclear forces.</TEXT></DOC>
