This happens because a person infected with the AIDS virus mayhave the virus in semen or vaginal fluids. The virus can enter thebody through the vagina, penis, rectum or mouth.   Anal intercourse, with or without a condom, is risky. The rectumis easily injured during anal intercourse.   Remember, AIDS is sexually transmitted, and the AIDS virus isnot the only infection that is passed through intimate sexualcontact.   Other sexual transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhea, syphilis,herpes and chlamydia, can also be contracted through oral, anal andvaginal intercourse. If you are infected with one of these diseasesand engage in risky behavior you are at greater risk of gettingAIDS.</TEXT><TEXT/><HEAD>You Won't Get AIDS From Insects _ Or A Kiss</HEAD><TEXT>   No matter what you may have heard, the AIDS virus is hard to getand is easily avoided.

The AIDS virus is transmitted throughsexual intercourse, the sharing of drug needles, or to babies ofinfected mothers before or during birth.   You won't get the AIDS virus through everyday contact with thepeople around you in school, in the workplace, at parties, childcare centers, or stores. You won't get it by swimming in a pool,even if someone in the pool is infected with the AIDS virus.Students attending school with someone infected with the AIDS virusare not in danger from casual contact.   You won't get AIDS from a mosquito bite. The AIDS virus is nottransmitted through a mosquito's salivary glands like otherdiseases such as malaria or yellow fever. You won't get it from bedbugs, lice, flies or other insects, either.   You won't get AIDS from saliva, sweat, tears, urine or a bowelmovement.   You won't get AIDS from a kiss.   You won't get AIDS from clothes, a telephone, or from a toiletseat. It can't be passed by using a glass or eating utensils thatsomeone else has used. You won't get the virus by being on a bus,train or crowded elevator with a person who is infected with thevirus, or who has AIDS.</TEXT><TEXT/><HEAD>What Behavior Puts You At Risk?</HEAD><TEXT>   You are at risk of being infected with the AIDS virus if youhave sex with someone who is infected, or if you share drug needlesand syringes with someone who is infected.

Sexualintercourse as a part of dating can be risky. One of the risks isAIDS.   How can you tell if someone you're dating or would like to datehas been exposed to the AIDS virus? The bad news is, you can't. Butthe good news is, as long as sexual activity and sharing drugneedles are avoided, it doesn't matter.   You are going to have to be careful about the person you becomesexually involved with, making your own decision based on your ownbest judgment. That can be difficult.   Has this person had any sexually transmitted diseases? How manypeople have they been to bed with? Have they experimented withdrugs? All these are sensitive, but important, questions. But youhave a personal responsibility to ask.   Think of it this way. If you know someone well enough to havesex, then you should be able to talk about AIDS. If someone isunwilling to talk, you shouldn't have sex.</TEXT><TEXT/><HEAD>Do Married People Get AIDS?</HEAD><TEXT>   Married people who are uninfected, faithful and don't shootdrugs are not at risk.
