It was the second birth this year among China's captive pandas,making it a banner year. The rare black-and-white animals, whosenumbers have dropped sharply in the wild to about 1,000, do notbreed readily in captivity.   Xinhua said Jingjing's cubs, born Thursday, weigh 3.5 ounceseach. It gave no other details about them.   Pandas refuse to nurse more than one cub at a time, so staff atthe zoo in southwestern China are nursing the second cub, Xinhuasaid.   Jingjing bore her first cub in 1987. The two latest were theproducts of insemination with frozen semen, Xinhua said, a techniquethat Chinese scientists favor.   The Fuzhou Zoo in eastern China reported the birth of a cub inJune but did not say how the mother, Qingqing, was inseminated.   Official tallies of the number of pandas in captivity in Chinavary widely, but recent reports put the figure at more than 80.Another panda in Chengdu's zoo, Meimei, has been given the title``hero mother'' for bearing nine cubs since 1980. Six have survived.</TEXT></DOC>
