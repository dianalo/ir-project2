(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Pamela PfiffnerandM;Cupertino, Calif.andP;  -- It was a roller coaster week for Apple.andP;  On Oct.andP;  15,the company hit a high as it pulled out all the stops to introduce its threenew Macs.andP;  The next day its stock plunged to a 52-week low, and on Oct.andP;  18,the company's fiscal 1990 results showed that the bumpy ride isn't over yet.andM;For the year ended Sept.andP;  30, Apple reported revenues of $5.558 billion, a 5percent increase from 1989.andP;  Net income rose 5 percent, to $474.9 million, or$3.77 per share.andM;But fourth-quarter results confirmed that lagging sales and the transition tolow-cost machines have taken a financial toll.andP;  Revenues for the quarterslipped 2 percent from the same period a year ago, to $1.354 billion.andM;Net income for the three months was $98.5 million, a drop of 39 percent from$161.1 million a year ago.andP;  The 1989 figure was inflated by the $48 millionApple earned from the sale of its shares in Adobe Systems Inc., butdiscounting that windfall, this year's results represented a substantialdecline.andP;  Earnings were 81 cents per share, down 35 percent from 1989'sfigure of $1.24, of which 37 cents resulted from the sale of the Adobeshares.andM;&quot;Fiscal 1990 was a year of mixed results,&quot; Apple CEO John Sculley said in aprepared statement.andP;  &quot;While we experienced significant revenue and unitgrowth in our Apple Macintosh personal computer products during fiscal 1990,sales of some of our more established products declined.&quot;andM;While earnings generally were in line with analysts' projections, Apple's1990 results were slightly better than expected.andP;  Apple's stock pricestumbled, bottoming out at $25 per share on Oct.andP;  16, the day after the newMacs made their debut.andM;Analysts agreed that Apple's stock is in part a victim of the economicslowdown currently gripping the nation and that technology stocks are amongthe first to be sold off.andM;At last week's product rollout, Sculley acknowledged the country is in themidst of a recession but said Apple is confident.andP;  &quot;We have more orders forthese products in a recessionary environment than any other products Applehas ever produced,&quot; he said.andP;  Orders had been placed for 125,000 of the newMacs, he said.andM;Yet Apple has to take some of the blame for its sagging stock prices,analysts said, pointing to high operating expenses.andM;Even after much-publicized cost-cutting measures in January, Apple's generaland administrative costs rose almost 14 percent to $371 million for the year.andO;The company also continued to pump more money into Randamp;D, spending $478 millionvs.andP;  $420 million in 1989.andM;&quot;Apple is not serious about cutting operating costs, but if it doesn't adjustits costs, it's in real trouble,&quot; said Steven Ossad, a technology analystwith Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.andM;While they generally applauded Apple's move toward low-cost, high-volumeMacs, analysts expect the company's fat gross margins will become leaner.andM;&quot;The new products will do well,&quot; Ossad said.andP;  &quot;The price points are lower,but the question is how much will they drive down gross margins?andP;  I thinkthat's why we're seeing a lot of pressure on Apple's stock.&quot;andM;Sculley agreed gross margins will fall.andP;  &quot;One effect of Apple's new productline of high-volume, lower-priced products will be lower gross margins,&quot; hesaid in a press release.andP;  &quot;In this new fiscal year, we believe that our grossmargins will fall from an unsustainably high level of 53 percent of salesachieved in fiscal 1990.&quot;andM;Doug van Dorsten, a Lehman Brothers analyst in San Francisco, said he expectsgross margins to settle around 50 percent in 1991.andM;&quot;Apple's better off than it was a year ago, given the economic outlook,&quot; saidBruce Lupatkin, an analyst with Hambrecht andamp; Quist in San Francisco.andP;  &quot;If itjust had the higher-price stuff and the dying Apple II line going into thiseconomic slowdown, it would be in a much worse place than today with thislower-priced Mac line.&quot;andM;&quot;There's a big opportunity for Apple,&quot; said van Dorsten.andP;  &quot;If it does a goodjob of marketing and continues the rate of product introduction that WallStreet is expecting, then there could be substantial growth in 1991.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
