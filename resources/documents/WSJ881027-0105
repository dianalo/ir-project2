Patterson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> F </CO><IN> AUT ERN </IN><DATELINE> DEARBORN, Mich.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ford Motor Co. continued to rely on surging overseas profits to achieve record third-quarter earnings that increased 22% from a year earlier.    The No. 2 U.S. auto maker reported that net income in the Sept. 30 quarter totaled $856 million, or $1.78 a share, up from $703 million, or $1.38 a share, in the 1987 period. The year-earlier per-share figure was adjusted to reflect last December's 2-for-1 stock split.    Total sales for the quarter rose to $17.73 billion from $15.25 billion a year earlier.    Ford said 45% of its third-quarter profit came from operations outside the U.S. The just-ended period was the second consecutive quarter in which strong overseas profit substantially supported overall earnings, suggesting that troubling trends persist in the U.S.    The importance of overseas profits &quot;reflects the fact that margins in the U.S. are under pressure this year,&quot; said David N. McCammon, Ford's vice president of finance. &quot;Material and labor costs have gone up more this year than they have in the last several years&quot; and marketing costs have gone up as well, he said.    He noted that raw materials such as copper and aluminum cost Ford at least 25% more this year than last year. Meanwhile, Ford has been pouring more money into the development of products it needs to stay competitive. In addition, the cost of incentives also hurt U.S. profits.    Mr. McCammon said Ford expects the higher costs to continue in the fourth quarter, but decrease somewhat next year.    As a result of the rising costs, Ford's U.S. earnings dropped 20% in the quarter to $472 million, even though the company increased its share of the U.S. car market to 21.3% from 20% a year earlier.    One reason for the U.S. earnings decline was the temporary shutdown during most of the quarter at Ford's Lorain, Ohio, plant, which builds some of the company's most profitable cars. A spokesman said the auto maker lost output of about 50,000 Ford Thunderbirds and Mercury Cougars because of the model changeover closing that began in July. The redesigned versions of the two cars won't go on sale until Dec. 26, though output has resumed.    Scott Merlis, an auto industry analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., estimated that the production loss cost Ford 27 cents a share in net income. Another analyst, David Healy, of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said Ford makes about $4,500 in profit on each Thunderbird/Cougar sale, after accounting for overhead.    Overseas, the picture was much brighter. Helped by the continued strength of its Europe operations and a rebound in Latin America, Ford's foreign profits more than tripled to $384 million from $110 million. Mr. McCammon said profits in Mexico and South America were a substantial improvement over unspecified heavy losses a year earlier.    These gains also helped Ford overcome the weaker performance of its financial services group. The auto maker said earnings were lower for its Ford Motor Credit unit and its First Nationwide Financial Corp. thrift unit because of lower interest margins and mounting losses from delinquent auto loans. Mr. McCammon attributed the auto loan problem partly to the increasing availability of car loans to high-risk buyers. He said Ford is re-evaluating such lending practices.    Overall, Ford's earnings came in slightly higher than what most analysts had expected. While the auto maker's stock slipped 87.5 cents to $53.125, ex-dividend, yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the decline seemed to be more in line with the general market drop than with any specific reaction to Ford's earnings.    Although Ford didn't make a major acquisition in the quarter, it reduced its sizable cash reserves by nearly $1 billion to $9.3 billion. The company paid back about $500 million in debt and spent about $500 million in capital improvements.    Mr. McCammon said Ford still is considering major acquisitions -- most likely in the financial services industry. However, he declined to comment on recent rumors that Ford was looking at part of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co.'s financial network.    Ford sold 1.34 million cars and trucks to its dealers world-wide in the third quarter, 9.6% more than a year earlier. Its sales to dealers in the U.S. and Canada increased 12% to 783,170 in the period.    (Revised Nov. 2, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
