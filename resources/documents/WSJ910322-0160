Until now, only electron microscopes have been able to seesuch tiny structures, but they couldn't view living cells,because living matter can't survive their powerful electronbeams.</LP><TEXT>   Bell Labs, the research arm of American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co., already has received inquiries from microscopemanufacturers about licensing the new technology, one of thescientists said.   The new microscope uses a laser and optical fiber toresolve an image only 12 nanometers in diameter, one-fourththe size that can be seen in the most powerful existingoptical microscopes. The new microscope uses a light beamthat's 20 nanometers wide and 10,000 times brighter thanearlier light sources. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter,or about four hundred-millionths of an inch.   The development, reported in the current issue of Scienceby Bell Labs' scientists Eric Betzig and Jay Trautman, ispart of a decade-long race to perfect optical microscopesthat will eventually be able to see objects the size ofmolecules.   Optical microscopes, which have been around for 300 years,work by shining light upward through an object into themicroscope. Objects that bend the light waves become visibleas shadows. But objects smaller than the lengths of the lightwaves don't diffract light and remain invisible.   Electron microscopes, by contrast, pick up far tinierobjects, some the size of atoms, because electrons haveshorter wavelengths than light waves used in opticalequipment. But they have the drawback of killing livingmatter.   The new Bell Labs microscope is a type known as a&quot;near-field&quot; microscope, in which the microscope and itslight source are brought extremely close to the object. Thewidth of the light beam that shines up through the objectdetermines how small an object can be seen. Previousnear-field microscope experiments have produced spots oflight 50 nanometers wide by shining light through hollowglass tubes known as micropipettes.   However, the light beam would weaken as it bounced off thewall of the pipette until it reached the opening at the tipof the pipette. When the light beam emerged, some of thelight would spread around the object instead of piercing it,thus impairing resolution. Moreover, the light source, ifdrawn too close to a sample such as a cell, would scramble itlike an egg.   For these reasons, the Bell Labs scientists decidedagainst using a micropipette as a conduit for delivering thelight beam. Instead, they took a strand of extremely clearoptical fiber tapered to a tiny tip. They coated the taperedportion of the fiber with an aluminum glaze, being careful toleave the very tip bare. For the light source, they affixed alaser to the opposite end of the fiber.   They found that the tapered point helps to concentrate thelight as it travels toward the bare tip, which is &quot;perfectlyclear,&quot; says Mr. Betzig. The light beam that emerges is only12 nanometers wide, and the tip can be brought close enoughto follow the contours of a living cell with practically nodispersion of light -- and no scrambled eggs.   The microscope operates as a scanner, converting the lightreceived from the specimen into data that a computer takesand reassembles into an image displayed on a video screen.   Besides examining cells and their internal structures, thenew microscope can be used to visualize details on suchelectronic devices as magneto optic storage disks and tostudy lithographic patterns etched into photo-resistmaterials. Tests show the unit will even perform&quot;fluorescence contrast&quot; so that cell parts stained withfluorescent dyes can be examined.   A near-field microscope using the Bell Labs design wouldcost about $20,000, whereas electron microscopes can fetch asmuch as $1 million, says Mr. Trautman. One hurdle remains,however: The microscope produces only extremely slow-motionvideo images. &quot;Right now, we can scan two frames a second vs.TV's 30 frames a second,&quot; says Mr. Betzig. &quot;But we're workingon improving that.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
