From thesecross sections, the fragment isobaric yields were deduced. The resultingisobaric yield distribution is very similar to that observed for reactionsin which limiting fragmentation is occurring (such as the reaction of8 GeV /sup 20/Ne with /sup 197/Au) and unlike that observed with projectilesof similar velocity. This apparent extreme example of total projectilekinetic energy scaling is compared to predictions of the intranuclearcascade model.</TEXT></DOC>
