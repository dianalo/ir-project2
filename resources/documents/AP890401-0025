However, the ministers said they will meet again in Guatemala onApril 13-14 to continue their negotiations.   Nicaragua has pushed for quick disbanding of the rebels, most ofwhom live in border camps in neighboring Honduras.   Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Rivera of Costa Rica toldreporters that the diplomats could not ``arrive at an accord fordemobilization of the Contras.''   The Central American presidents agreed Feb. 14 to come up with aplan by mid-May for disarming the rebels. They would either berepatriated with their families or relocated. In exchange,Nicaragua said it would adopt domestic democratic reforms.   The agreement took U.S. officials by surprise. They have saidthe rebels should remain in place as an army to put pressure on theleftist Sandinista government of Nicaragua to make reforms.   The foreign ministers disagreed. ``It is the collectiveresponsibility of the five governments to look for paths to obtainthe demobilization,'' Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos LopezContreras told a news conference after talks ended. Honduras hasbeen a strong U.S. ally, but it has recently objected publicly tothe presence of the rebels, known as Contras, on its territory.   However, the foreign minister said his government did not have aspecific plan for demobilization. ``What we have are ideas,reflections,'' he said.   The foreign ministers of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras,Guatemala and Costa Rica met in San Jose to lay groundwork for aregional summit at which their presidents are to decide how todisband the Contras.   Lopez Contreras said earlier Friday that the summit would be putoff from May 15 to June 15 to allow El Salvador's new president,Alfredo Cristiani, to take office.   At the San Jose meetings, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister MiguelD'Escoto also gave his colleagues a proposal for a regional fightagainst drug trafficking that would include U.S. assistance. Theforeign ministers said they will try to meet in Nicaragua April11-12 to discuss the proposal.   They also agreed to meet in Guatemala in early May to prpare forthe presidential summit. The exact dates of the second Guatemalameeting are to be decided later.   Although no accords were reached, the foreign ministers said thetalks were fruitful.   ``If we didn't believe peace in Central America was possible, wewouldn't be fighting for it,'' Costa Rican Foreign Minister RodrigoMadrigal Nieto said.   The Contras fought the Nicaraguan government for eight years.However, the fighting has trailed off since early last year, whenthe U.S. Congress cut off military aid to the rebels.   President Daniel Ortega said Thursday that $45 million innon-military aid under consideration by the U.S. Congress should beused to disband the Contras.   As now envisioned, the package would provide the Contras with$4.5 million a month through Feb. 28, 1990, four days after whatNicaragua pledged will be free and democratic general elections.   Nicaragua says Washington would be violating regional peaceaccords by maintaining the Contras as a potential fighting force.The Contras and their families in Honduras number 10,000 to 11,000.   The ministers on Thursday formally approved deploying a smallgroup of unarmed U.N. military observers to monitor CentralAmerican border conflicts.   Canada, Spain and West Germany agreed to contribute to theforce. Costa Rican President Oscar Arias said he asked Venezuela tosend observers also.   The United Nations has made no decision on such a force.</TEXT></DOC>
