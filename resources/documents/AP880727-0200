In an order preventing an earlier walkout, President Reagan saida strike against Candamp;NW would disrupt essential rail shipping inseveral Midwest states and halt service for 40,000 Chicago-areacommuters.   Two days of bargaining in the presence of federal mediatorsended Tuesday without a settlement, and the company said no newsessions were planned.   Chicago andamp; North Western spokesman James Foote was quotedWednesday as saying the company would go ahead with plans toeliminate the jobs of 1,156 brakemen next week and that the unioncan strike.   However, another spokesman said Candamp;NW remains willing tonegotiate.   ``We have left the door open for further talks if the union'swilling to come and sit down,'' North Western's Fred Bloedorn said.``But if there's no hint that there's going to be any place tonegotiate, there's no sense in meeting for nothing.''   UTU President Fred Hardin, meanwhile, said his union wouldreturn to the bargaining table whenever the company wants to talk.   ``We're perfectly willing to negotiate and attempt to resolveit,'' Hardin said. ``But the carrier seems determined toprecipitate a strike.''   Chicago andamp; North Western wants to eliminate the jobs of 1,156 ofits 2,600 unionized brakemen, changing the makeup of most traincrews from an engineer, conductor and two brakemen to only anengineer and conductor.   The nation's eighth-largest rail carrier said it could save $51million a year and become more competitive if it made the cuts, butthe union said the action would compromise safety and violate itscontract.   UTU members threatened to walk off the job at 12:01 a.m. Aug. 4if the company makes the cuts.   An emergency board appointed by the president in April tointervene in the dispute issued a report July 1 proposing thelayoff of 689 brakemen, cuttng one brakeman per train in most casesand both brakemen when approved by an arbitrator on atrain-by-train basis.   Both sides rejected the report, the union calling it toosweeping and the company saying it didn't go far enough.   Union and company bargainers had broken off negotiations onMarch 22 but resumed talks Monday under the supervision of theNational Mediation Board.   ``If either party refuses to meet, there's not much we can doabout it,'' said Charles R. Barnes, executive director of thefederal agency.</TEXT></DOC>
