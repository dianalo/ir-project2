An appeals court, meanwhile, granted temporary respite from the fines.    &quot;In short, our goal is to save Yonkers from itself,&quot; said New York Secretary of State Gail Shaffer, head of the Yonkers Emergency Financial Control Board, after the board voted to assume control of all city spending.    The meeting took place as a divided appeals court barely approved Yonkers' request of a stay of fines levied by U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand for defying a housing desegregation order. Those fines -- $100 for the first day, Aug. 2, and doubling every day -- threatened to reach $337 million by day 22, bankrupting the state's fourth largest city.    The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay that blocks fines against both the city and the councilmen until Aug. 17, when appeals in the case will be argued in federal court.    The three-judge appeals court panel split 2-1 on whether to grant the stay. </TEXT></DOC>
