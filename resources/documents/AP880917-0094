Ken Gray says that in his southernIllinois district, support for the National Rifle Association isalmost as strong as for the Pledge of Allegiance.   So when the NRA told Gray's constituents to make sure he votedagainst a waiting period for handgun purchases, they responded.   A week ago, they surrounded his car in the district andvirtually kept him prisoner inside until he promised to help stripthe waiting period from an anti-drug bill.   They repeated verbatim all the NRA arguments _ especially thefear that this was the beginning of the end of gun ownership.   Last Thursday, the Illinois Democrat was part of the 228-182majority that voted to eliminate from an anti-drug bill a seven-daywaiting period for handgun purchases and an optional backgroundcheck of the buyer. The House substituted a requirement that theJustice Department develop a system for gun dealers to checkwhether buyers are convicted felons.   Gray's case, more than almost any other, shows just how powerfulthe tug of the NRA can be.   He has no fear of defeat, because he's not running forre-election due to health reasons.   He said he personally supports a waiting period and believes hisconstituents were ``brainwashed by the NRA.''   And he had an emotional reason to support the waiting period,since two of his longtime friends and former constituents are Jimand Sarah Brady.   The waiting period is symbolically named after Jim Brady, thepresidential press secretary who was shot along with PresidentReagan in the March 30, 1981, attempt on Reagan's life. Sarah Bradyis the vice chair of Handgun Control Inc., which joined thenation's major law enforcement organizations to lobby hard for thewaiting period.   So why did Gray vote with the NRA?   In his district, Gray said, ``after the Pledge of Allegiance,the NRA comes next. If I'm their spokesman, I'm not going to pull aholier than thou routine. I'm sitting here as a hired hand.''   The tug of the NRA wasn't as direct on all House members, but itwas there nonetheless.   Rep. Helen Delich Bentley, R-Md., is a strong-willed lawmakerwho would never be called a wimp by her colleagues. A co-sponsor ofthe drug bill that contained the Brady language, she said she toldNRA backers ``I supported Brady and leave me alone.''   Ms. Bentley said in an interview she was not pressured by theNRA. But when the voting began, she watched the NRA supporters pileup an increasing margin for their substitute language.   When the pro-NRA count reached a majority, she decided shecouldn't be of help to the waiting-period forces. Bowing to theinevitable, she inserted her electronic card into a slot that casther vote for the NRA's position.   ``I wanted to see what would happen,'' she said. ``I told SarahBrady a long time ago I would support her amendment. But I made adecision to vote depending on what was on the table. When I voted,the Brady amendment was gone.''   It was not the first time the 3-million-member NRA won a guncontrol fight, though the opposition this time was more formidable.   The opponents matched the NRA's zeal, but the gun control forcescould not match the NRA's financial resources, said Dewey Stokes,the president of the Fraternal Order of Police.   David Conover, an NRA lobbyist, attributed his group's victoryto hard work, good strategy and some last-minute luck.   The gun group, as it has many times before, mobilized its 21field representatives across the country and thousands of activistvolunteers.   When the Brady language appeared ready for a vote two weeks ago,the NRA count estimated only a narrow 10-vote victory.   Then, the vote was postponed for a week.   ``We got lucky,'' Conover said, because the postponement allowedthousands of NRA members to receive their latest issue of eitherAmerican Hunter or American Rifleman _ the NRA magazines. Althoughprepared in August, the publications contained an ad urging membersto call members of Congress to vote against the waiting period.   ``People saw in the magazine it still was not resolved,''Conover said, and apparently turned a steady stream of contactswith lawmakers into a last-minute flood.   Meanwhile, Handgun Control Inc., saying law enforcementuniformly supported the waiting period, brought hundreds ofuniformed police officers to Washington as lobbyists.   But months before, the NRA had begun compiling names of policeofficers who backed the gun lobby's positions and opposed thewaiting period.   Two weeks ago, the NRA brought its police backers to Washington,and House members began receiving visits by rank-and-file officersfrom both sides.   The pro-Brady police officers were given space in a House officebuilding by the Judiciary Committee, whose chairman, Peter W.Rodino Jr., D-N.J., supported their cause. They turned the hearingroom into a command center, directing the lobbying effort.   The pro-NRA police had breakfast each morning at the NRAcafeteria, and then were bused to Capitol Hill.   ``When more than 100 rank-and-file police officers came toCapitol Hill and, in their own words, argued against a waitingperiod, that had a big effect,'' Conover said.   ``It showed what we had been saying, but had not demonstrated:that law enforcement was not united on this issue.''</TEXT></DOC>
