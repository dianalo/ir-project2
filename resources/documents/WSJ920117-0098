But theregion, lean and muscular after weathering a near knockout inthe early 1980s, still is faring better than the two coasts.   The Great Lakes states -- except for auto-dependentMichigan, which has been stumbling for months -- had managedto sidestep most recessionary effects. Last summer much ofthe Midwest felt secure as unemployment rose and home pricessunk on the coasts.</LP><TEXT>   But the news last week that Illinois had the highestjobless rate among the nation's biggest states, at 9.3%, senta chill through Midwestern spines. Michigan was second at9.1%, two percentage points above the national rate.   &quot;The Midwest is catching the rest of the nation's cold,&quot;says Diane Swonk, a First Chicago Corp. economist. &quot;But Idon't think it will last as long.&quot;   Illinois's sudden jump in the jobless rate can beattributed in part to special factors. Midway Airlines lastmonth shut operations, putting some 3,800 people out of workin the state. Caterpillar Inc. has endured an 11-week strikeand lockout that has hurt suppliers and sent economic shiversthrough large communities such as Peoria, Decatur and Aurora.   Still, Loleta Didrickson, director of the state'sdepartment of employment security, said the weakness cutsacross industry, geographic and demographic boundaries,affecting both blue-collar and white-collar workers. InNovember, 75 companies cut 50 or more workers. &quot;Illinois isreally feeling the full impact of the recession,&quot; says Ms.Didrickson.   All this has fed consumer doubts. &quot;We're going downhill,losing work constantly,&quot; says Larry Kelley, president of aJoliet, Ill., local of the International Association ofMachinists.   What's more, Chicago, the Midwest's hub, has experienced aglut of office space, slowing down construction. The city'sChamber of Commerce estimates that the year-end downtownoffice vacancy rate was at 16%, up from 14% six monthsearlier. One 65-story building adjacent to the Sears Tower inthe city's business district sits half empty after opening 15months ago.   &quot;There's some genuine surprise that we've been hit as hardas we've been by the recession,&quot; says Michael Lawrence, aspokesman for Gov. Jim Edgar. The Republican governor hasprojected a budget deficit of more than $500 million, leadingto talk of cutting such sacrosanct items as education.   In Michigan, widely reported state budget cuts havealready sliced much of the state's safety net. The MichiganHumane Society recently decided to hand out free cat and dogfood for those who couldn't afford to feed their pets. But aHumane Society spokeswoman worries that some people are sobad off that they are taking the food for their ownconsumption.   While Michigan and Illinois are undoubtedly ailing, theother Great Lake states -- Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana andMinnesota -- are making out relatively well. The disparitywithin the region is unusual. Ordinarily, these states sinkor swim together. &quot;States which once went hand in hand intothe recession have broken apart,&quot; says First Chicago's Ms.Swonk.   Ohio, for instance, ranks right behind Michigan in autoproduction. But the presence of foreign car makers has helpedkeep the state relatively healthy. Honda Motor Co., whichemploys 9,650 people in its three Ohio auto plants, didn'tfurlough anyone last year -- or in the last dozen years, forthat matter. And most of its 150 U.S. suppliers are locatedin the state.   &quot;This has been a fun thing to watch because we really gotbeaten down in the '80-'81 recession,&quot; says James W. Coons,vice president and chief economist at Huntington NationalBank in Columbus, Ohio.   In Wisconsin, meanwhile, Gov. Tommy Thompson studiouslyavoids saying the state is in a recession. With good reason.New business incorporations jumped 12.5% in 1991.Construction spending was down just 1% to $6.8 billion. Andstrong exports, propelled by the weak dollar, continued toprop up the state's manufacturers.   &quot;The Wisconsin economy is in a growth mode,&quot; says Gov.Thompson, a Republican, who boasts he has a balanced budgetand money in the bank.   In Indiana, the largest steel-producing state, somebusinesses think it has gotten as bad as it is going to getand that isn't so bad. Nipsco Industries Inc., a utilityserving northern Indiana, sees continued slow growth thisyear. While national steel shipments dropped an estimated7.5% last year, Nipsco expects it to be about flat in 1992.&quot;We're holding up remarkably well,&quot; says Nipsco vicepresident, Joe Turner. &quot;We haven't seen any significantdowndraft in the economy.&quot; Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. raised theratings of the utility's stock and debt last month.   Nonetheless, there is nervousness about the coming months.When Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp. surveyed manufacturing executivesin November, their sentiment was at its lowest since a yearearlier, when the outlook was clouded by the Persian Gulfconflict. Douglas Handler, manager of econometric analysisfor the business information company, said manufacturers'expectations improved in December, an indicator that thesector had reached bottom.   The full percentage point cut in the Federal Reserve'sdiscount rate in late December to 3.5% should provide anotherboost. The discount rate is the rate on Fed loans to memberbanks. With the cost of capital coming down, Mr. Handlerbelieves the nation is poised for a &quot;manufacturingledcyclical upturn.&quot;   But Illinois, hit late by the recession, could take longerto pull out. Executives are still reeling from the joblessfigures announced last week. Illinois Power Co., which servesthe central and southern parts of the state, says it expectsindustrial sales to remain flat through this coming year. &quot;Itwill take us most of 1992 to get back into a growth mode,&quot;says the utility's Larry Altenbaumer, vice president andchief financial officer.   Even healthy states are worried. Minnesota Gov. Arne H.Carlson has proposed creating 8,000 construction jobs as partof what he is calling a &quot;recession response.&quot; That despitethe fact that the state boasted a November jobless rate of5%. A spokeswoman for the governor says the chief concern isconsumer confidence, which could be boosted by &quot;thesurrounding publicity around this type of thing.&quot;   Huntington National Bank's Mr. Coons, who is otherwiseoptimistic about the coming months in Ohio, worries, too,that people &quot;are not hopeful where the economy is going.&quot;   In Illinois, a beleaguered Gov. Edgar looks forencouraging signs anywhere he can find them. After visitingthe annual National Housewares Manufacturers' show in ChicagoMonday, he sounded upbeat. The show's sponsors told him thatvisitors and exhibits were up from last year.   &quot;I'm hoping that maybe the psychological thing can beturned around,&quot; he said on his return to Springfield, thestate capital, where he continued his battle with thelegislature over the proposed budget cuts.</TEXT></DOC>
