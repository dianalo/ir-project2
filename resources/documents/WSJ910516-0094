Mr. Bush, who disclosed his position in remarks toreporters, has until June 3 to formally notify Congress thathe plans to grant China most-favored-nation trade status foranother year. That status would guarantee China themost-favorable treatment available on tariffs and quotasunder U.S. trade laws. Congress would have 30 days after theformal notification to vote down the president's decision.</LP><TEXT>   Within Congress, anger toward China over human rights,arms sales and its trade surplus with the U.S. has beenbuilding rapidly in recent weeks. As a result, there's sureto be a drive to block Mr. Bush's effort to continue China'spreferential trade treatment, or at least to attachconditions to it, congressional aides say.   Mr. Bush, a former U.S. envoy to China, has frequentlyargued against taking steps that would isolate Beijing andremove incentives for the government there to further relaxits Communist system. He reiterated those arguments yesterdayin disclosing that he had made a &quot;strong pitch&quot; for continuedmost-favored-nation status for China at a lunch withRepublican senators.   &quot;We do not want to isolate China,&quot; Mr. Bush said. &quot;Andthough there are major problems in China, things that wedon't like about their system, things are an awful lot betterthan they were back in 1975,&quot; when Mr. Bush was posted there.   Mr. Bush also said he appreciated Chinese support duringthe drive to force Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. China wentalong with United Nations resolutions exerting diplomatic andeconomic pressure on Iraq. But the Beijing government alsoangered administration officials by abstaining on the crucialvote authorizing the use of force to drive Iraqi troops outof Kuwait.   In addition, Britain has been pressuring the U.S. tocontinue China's favorable trade status. Britain worries thatfailure to do so would hurt the economy of neighboring HongKong, a British colony that's scheduled to be turned over toChina in coming years.   But many lawmakers are angered about China's human rightspractices, particularly its failure to move more quickly toloosen the internal crackdown instituted after 1989pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing. In addition,lawmakers are troubled by China's trade surplus with theU.S., which rose to $10.4 billion last year and appears to bewidening this year. Those concerns are compounded by a newreport from a human rights group asserting that China useswhat amounts to slave labor to produce some goods.   China's image has been tarnished further by recent reportsthat it may be planning to sell Pakistan a missile capable ofcarrying nuclear warheads and is helping Algeria build anuclear reactor that could be useful in a nuclear weaponsprogram.   Even if Congress passes a resolution blocking thepresident's decision to grant China most-favored-nation tradestatus, Mr. Bush could veto the resolution. In that case,both houses of Congress would have to muster two-thirdsmajorities to override the veto and stop the trade benefitsfrom going into effect.</TEXT></DOC>
