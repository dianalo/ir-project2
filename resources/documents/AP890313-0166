But other senior judges are concerned _ even angry _ thatcolleagues take pay boosts without working. A third group issatisfied with current pay levels for semi-retired judges butbelieves that younger, full-time judges deserve more money.   An Associated Press survey, conducted in February and March, ofthe nation's 277 senior federal judges found that 48, or 17 percent,no longer do any judicial work. Nevertheless, they remain eligible _and in most cases, eager _ for any pay raises granted to activejudges. The survey was undertaken because the government refuses torelease its own data on the workload of individual senior judges.   The AP found most judges reduce their workload when they takesenior status; many give up criminal cases; some drop complicatedcivil cases. Nevertheless, they handle 10 to 15 percent of the totalfederal court workload, which is considered a godsend by their 750active colleagues.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Bush administration is prepared to ease theU.S. trade embargo against Nicaragua and take a number of otherconciliatory measures if that country shows it is serious aboutholding fair elections next year, according to U.S. officials.

The two countrieshave not been represented at the level of ambassador in each other'scapital since last July.   The list of possible gestures toward the Sandinista governmentnumbers about 20, according to the officials, who asked not to beidentified.   Alternatively, the administration has prepared a potential listof punitive measures of similar length if Nicaraguan oppositionforces are not given what U.S. officials perceive to be an equalchance in the balloting, which probably will be held next February.</TEXT><DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Its attempt to blame leftistrebels a failure, the military is now admitting that its troopsmassacred 10 peasants in September and says nine soldiers will standtrial in the case.   U.S. Ambassador William Walker hailed Sunday's announcement as abreakthrough for human rights in this country where right-wing deathsquads have for so long slaughtered with impunity.   ``The high command of the armed forces is admitting that theirearlier versions (of the massacre) have not held up underexamination and were wrong, scurrilous,'' Walker said Sunday.   But he added that it is too early to tell if the developmentsignals an end to the military's traditional immunity fromprosecution in human rights cases.</TEXT><DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va.

It establishes, too, that some folks who give fish their ordinarynames _ their street names, you might say _ would not make it in thepublic relations business.   Not as long as they insist on applying the name longnosedpigfaced bream to a fish that's marketed under the noble nameemperor.   And not if they insist on calling the grunt the brown sweetlips.Or calling the anchovy the smig. Or the grenadier the rattail.   Just off the government's presses is ``The Fish List: FDA Guideto Acceptable Market Names for Food Fish Sold in InterstateCommerce.''   It is a compilation of the market names that the governmentaccepts for imported and domestically available fish sold for humanconsumption.</TEXT></DOC>
