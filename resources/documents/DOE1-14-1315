<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-14-1315 </DOCNO><TEXT>Contributions of the two-, three- and four-body correlations to the bindingenergy of nuclear matter are calculated for potentials with soft-core.The potentials are composed of both attractive and repulsive parts. Thepotentials used are of the Yamaguchi, Gaussian and Tabakin forms. Thesingle-particle potentials are considered to vanish for states abovethe Fermi sea. At k/sub F/ = 1.35 fm/sup -1/, the potentials give a bindingenergy of 7.92-9.97 MeV from two-body correlations. An extra bindingenergy from three-body correlations is provided with values of 2.49-3.08MeV. Four-body correlations add more binding energy of 0.71-1.13 MeV.Thus, the total contribution to the binding energy of nuclear matterfrom two-, three- and four-body correlations, using these potentialsand at k/sub F/ = 1.35 fm/sup -1/ is 11.12-14.18 MeV which is not farfrom the empirical value of 16 MeV. 28 refs., 2 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
