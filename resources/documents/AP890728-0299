BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal regulators closed three more Texas banksThursday, bringing to 99 the total number failures in the statethis year, only 14 less than all of last year.   In two of Thursday's closures, all deposits were transferred tonew owners, but at Forestwood National Bank of Dallas only depositsup to the $100,000 insured limit were transferred.   The federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency closedForestwood's two branches, citing problems brought on by acontinuing real estate collapse combined with liberal andaggressive lending practices.   OCC Senior Deputy Comptroller Frank Maguire also closed BrushyCreek National Bank in Round Rock, with the FDIC transferring thebank's deposits and some other liabilities to Union National Bankin Austin for a $1,000 premium.   And Texas Banking Commissioner Kenneth W. Littlefield shut TheTexas Bank andamp; Trust Co. in Sweetwater, about 42 miles west ofAbilene.   The OCC said 10-year-old Forestwood had assets of about $61.4million. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., named as receiver ofthe bank, approved the transfer of insured deposits and securedliabilities to Comerica Bank-Texas in Dallas.   In most failures, the FDIC has transferred all deposits, eventhose above the insurance limit, but it said only insured depositswere transferred ``because of an inability to determine the valueof the bank's assets and undeterminable exposure in significantcontingent liabilities.''   Comerica Bank is paying the FDIC $200,000 for the right toreceive the deposits, and it will purchase $39.4 million of thefailed bank's assets. The FDIC will retain assets with a book valueof about $22 million.   Union will assume $10.1 million in 2,400 Brushy Creek depositaccounts and has agreed to purchase certain Brushy Creek assets for$6.5 million with options to purchase more. The FDIC also willprovide $3.5 million in assistance and retain assets with a bookvalue of $3.5 million.   The OCC said Brushy Creek had assets of $10.1 million.   The FDIC sold the Texas Bank andamp; Trust Co.'s $35.6 million indeposits to First National Bank in Sweetwater for $457,000. FirstNational also agreed to purchase $29.1 million of the failed bank'sassets.   The FDIC will advance First National $6.1 million in assistance,plus retain assets with a book value of $7.5 million.</TEXT></DOC>
