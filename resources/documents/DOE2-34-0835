Thefollowing factors were studied: The connection between consumption andthe available income, the total consumption, number of persons of thehousehold, number of children living at home, the age of the person earningthe highest salary, as well as of different groups according to theirsocial status. If the job status of the principal wage earner is usedas criterium, the trade groups who had a particular high energy consumptionwere the self-employed farmers followed by the self-employed personsof the towns. The energy expenditure increases for the different tradegroups in relation to the increasing available income, but the shareof the total consumption decreases. If a division is made according tourban conditions it is the households of the rural districts and in smallurban areas who account for the largest energy consumption. If a divisionis made according to counties, the largest energy consumption has beenregistered in the counties of Sealand, Storstroem and Bornholm followedby the households of the metropolitan area (with the exception of Copenhagenand Frederiksberg). Also the connection between consumption and housingconditions dependent on ownership of dwellings and available income hasbeen studied. (LN).</TEXT></DOC>
