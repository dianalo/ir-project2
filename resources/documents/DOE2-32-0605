<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-32-0605 </DOCNO><TEXT>Although it has been recognized for some time that the rate of reactiveuptake of gases in cloudwater can depend on the value of the mass-accommodationcoefficient ({alpha}) describing interfacial mass transport (MT), definitiveevaluation of such rates is only now becoming possible with the availabilityof measurements of {alpha} for gases of atmospheric interest at air-waterinterfaces. Examination of MT limitation to the rate of in-cloud aqueous-phaseoxidation of SO{sub 2} by O{sub 3} and H{sub 2}O{sub 2} shows that despitethe low value of {alpha}{sub O3} (5 {times} 10{sup {minus}4}), interfacialMT of this species is not limiting under essentially all conditions ofinterest; the high values of {alpha} for SO{sub 2} ({ge} 0.2) and H{sub2}O{sub 2} ({ge} 0.08) indicate no interfacial MT limitation for thesespecies also. Although gas- and aqueous-phase MT can be limiting undercertain extremes of conditions, treating the system as under chemicalkinetic control is generally an excellent approximation. InterfacialMT limitation also is found not to hinder the rate of H{sub 2}O{sub 2}formation by aqueous-phase disproportionation of HO{sub 2}. Finally,the rapid uptake of N{sub 2}O{sub 5} by cloud droplets implies that theyield of aqueous HNO{sub 3} from in-cloud gas-phase oxidation of NO{sub2}by O{sub 3} can be substantial even under daytime conditions.
