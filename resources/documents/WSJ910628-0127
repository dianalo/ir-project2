Jack Danforth is a smart Missouri Republican whodoesn't object to being called &quot;the conscience of theSenate.&quot; Lately he's cast himself as the rightminded &quot;honestbroker&quot; between Democrats and the White House on civilrights. But is he?   Let's lift the veil on his backstage brokerage to seewhose cause St. Jack is really working for. Hint: He's makingTed Kennedy happier than President Bush. Hint Two: He needs along talk with Evan Kemp about equal justice under the law.</LP><TEXT>   Step back four weeks: After the House passed acivil-rights quota bill with too few votes to override apresidential veto, Mr. Danforth announces his Senate &quot;Gang ofNine&quot; to great fanfare. These nine GOP moderates are supposedto be the swing votes to over-ride a veto in the Senate andso force both sides to &quot;compromise.&quot;   Democrats were happier than the White House at this news,but Bush officials agreed to talk. After days of calls andletters, this Tuesday Mr. Danforth struck a compromise withWhite House Chief of Staff John Sununu and Attorney GeneralDick Thornburgh on the critical &quot;quota&quot; language. This was abig concession from the White House, which had previouslysaid it wouldn't budge from Mr. Bush's civil-rights bill. Mr.Danforth's spokesman advertised it as such to reporters.   St. Jack then took the deal back to the &quot;Gang of Nine.&quot;They too agreed on the compromise language. Mr. Sununu wasconfident enough to interrupt President Bush's dinner to tellhim about the breakthrough and to ensure that he too agreed.Mr. Bush did.   Then Mr. Danforth delivered his Teddygram. Mr. Kennedy,the Democratic pointman on civil rights despite his EasterWeekend at Au Bar, had objected to the Danforth-Sununucompromise. But instead of sticking by his agreement, Mr.Danforth agreed to the Kennedy veto. He told Mr. Sununu therewas no deal and he was back to drafting new language.Yesterday, he unveiled yet another version of his bill thatis closer to Mr. Kennedy than to the White House.   Mr. Danforth insists the &quot;agreement&quot; was merely to showsome new language to Democrats; Bush officials say they weresure they had a deal. They say he appears to them to beTeddy's intellectual baggage-carrier at worst, a cat's-paw atbest.   The cat's-paw charge seems fair, especially given Mr.Danforth's one-sided righteousness. He has refused tonegotiate with Boyden Gray, the White House counsel, sayingMr. Gray won't bargain in good faith. Mr. Danforth has nosuch objection to Mr. Kennedy or civil-rights lobbyingmaestro Ralph Neas, who are presumably nothing but sincere.So much for &quot;honest&quot; brokerage.   Someone should introduce Mr. Danforth and his Gang of Nineto Evan Kemp. As chairman of the Equal Employment OpportunityCommission, Mr. Kemp has one of those obscure Washington jobsthat actually affects lives outside the Beltway. He's thenation's chief anti-discrimination enforcer. And unlike Mr.Danforth, he won his civil-rights credentials the hard way,by living the fight.   The 54-year-old Mr. Kemp, who sits in but is notrestrained by a wheelchair, helped to found the disabilityrights movement. (He was crippled by a disease similar topolio 20 years ago.) He once worked for Ralph Nader'sDisability Rights Center, and was a leading voice in theeffort to pass last year's landmark Americans withDisabilities Act. It is precisely this personal experiencethat leads him to reject Mr. Danforth's attempts to broker aKennedy civil-rights bill.   The essence of the disability-rights movement isindividual rights, Mr. Kemp says. The essence of Mr.Danforth's effort is proportional representation, or grouprights by race or gender. The disabled want access to theworld so individuals can reach their potential. But rightsapportioned by group preference -- quotas in their many forms-- &quot;are a disaster for the disabled.&quot; They allow companies,he says, &quot;to hire what I call the three H's -- hangnails,hemorroids and hernia.&quot; Thus only those with minordisabilities get hired.   Mr. Kemp thinks a civil-rights compromise is futile untilboth sides put their philosophies candidly on the table. TheBush administration really &quot;wants to move back to merithiring and the civil-rights community wants proportionalrepre sentation&quot; in the workplace. &quot;We really haven't had anopen debate on this issue in 16 months,&quot; says Mr. Kemp.   Mr. Danforth's efforts reflect the typical Washingtonattempt to muffle debate to mute differences. But this isdangerous, says Mr. Kemp, who travels often, because &quot;whatthey don't realize is this is a huge issue in the country.&quot;The many forms of proportional representation that have beenin place since the 1960s have bred great resentment. He doesnot mince words: &quot;They are an absolute disaster.&quot;   The Supreme Court was saying something similar, if lessdire, in the 1989 civil-rights decisions that are the basisof today's civil-rights fight. Ted Kennedy and Ralph Neaswant to overturn those decisions precisely because they wantto sustain hiring by group. Mr. Danforth has shown this weekhe agrees with Mr. Kennedy. Someone should tell PresidentBush that this isn't an issue on which principles can beparsed. Sometimes what a nation needs isn't &quot;compromise&quot; butcandor.</TEXT></DOC>
