(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nine people were killed and scoreshospitalized Thursday night when a fire broke out in a 160-bednursing home, authorities said.   The fire was reported shortly after 10:30 p.m. on the secondfloor of the Hillhaven Rehabilitation and Convalescent Center, afour-story brick structure, said Norfolk Fire Chief Thomas E.Gardner.   ``We've avoided a really major disaster,'' Gardner said.   The cause and extent of the fire, which was extinguished aftermidnight, were not immediately known.   Authorities said seven bodies had been accounted for at thescene, and two more people were dead on arrival at Sentara NorfolkGeneral Hospital.   Dazed and confused, Hillhaven residents were taken to nearbyyards where firefighters, paramedics and neighbors tried to calmthem and keep them warm against the night air.   Inside the structure, firefighters found scores of bedriddenpatients whom they gingerly guided down ladders and smoke-filledhallways. Some patients were in their bedclothes; others werenaked. All seemed frightened.   Many of those overcome by smoke were taken to Sentara NorfolkGeneral Hospital.   Among them was Robert J. Bell, 82, who said he was in his roomon the second floor when the fire broke out.   ``I woke up in a roomful of smoke,'' he said. ``The whole roomwas saturated with smoke. You couldn't see and you couldn't hardlybreathe.''   Another second-floor resident, who was treated in the hospital'semergency room, 76-year-old Harriett Waddill, said:   ``Everything was quiet. We were going to bed. All of a sudden weheard this commotion in the hall. They were running up and down thehall and they were yelling, `Get him out of the room.' It wasgetting so black I couldn't even identify where my bed was.''   Hillhaven staff members knelt at the sides of many patients whowere not immediately taken to hospitals.   One man, who knelt between two patients, patted their heads andrubbed their shoulders, all the while telling them: ``You're safe.It will be all right.''</TEXT></DOC>
