Running today, his worry is Big No, or negatives.    Surveys indicate that as many as two of every five voters hold an unfavorable opinion of the vice president. His &quot;negatives&quot; are higher than those of any successful presidential candidate in recent memory. In fact, he falls in the same range that Barry Goldwater did in Gallup polls at this stage in 1964, and though the Bush campaign is confident the picture will greatly improve, no index is watched more closely as a measure of the vice president's liabilities and the race ahead.    After years in the shadow of Ronald Reagan, polls indicate, Mr. Bush remains a vaguely defined figure, buffeted by a public opinion that alternately blames him for the president's policies and faults him for not being as strong. His loyalist image runs against the popular sentiment for change, and a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll indicates that women perceive him as less caring and less reliable in a crisis than his Democratic rival, Michael Dukakis.    Among independents and Reagan Democrats, two groups that Mr. Bush must do well with, his negatives run against him. The same Journal/NBC survey found that two of every three Democrats who once voted for Mr. Reagan want a change in direction, and more than half said Mr. Bush isn't &quot;tough enough&quot; for the job. Comparable Gallup surveys indicate that Mr. Bush's favorable rating has plummeted among independents, who are more than twice as likely now to have a negative opinion of him than of his lesser-known Democratic rival.    &quot;He is a lightning rod for all those constituencies angry at Ronald Reagan,&quot; says GOP pollster Fred Steeper. Here in the French Quarter, a few miles from the Superdome where Mr. Bush will be nominated in August, Sen. John Breaux puts it bluntly. &quot;They liked Reagan because he was John Wayne,&quot; says the Louisiana Democrat. &quot;George Bush is not.&quot;    All polls are suspect so early in a campaign, but a candidate's favorability rating tends to fluctuate less wildly than the &quot;horse race&quot; predictions of November's outcome. By their nature, negatives reflect a more lasting, gut reaction by voters. However flimsy, this early impression can be a major impediment for a campaign already running behind. Survey data going back to 1960 show that in each of those years when the presidential election ended in a landslide -- 1964, 1972, 1980, and 1984 -- there were early signs that the loser's favorability rating was significantly below his rival's. In closer contests -- in 1960, 1968, and 1976 -- the gap was much smaller.    None of this is conclusive about 1988, but understanding the numbers and their origin provides insight into the candidates and their strategies. Mr. Bush's difficulties begin with the vice presidency, and his campaign coincides with a decline in support not only for the president but for the White House as an institution.    By identifying closely with Mr. Reagan, Mr. Bush helped his fortunes in GOP primaries last winter. But with the public at large, his negatives soon rose as well to the level of the president's. Gallup data indicate that this shift was virtually entirely among Democrats and independents. Since just last September, the total share of voters holding an unfavorable opinion of the vice president rose from 27% to 40%. &quot;George Bush has lived and died with Ronald Reagan,&quot; says Gallup vice president Larry Hugick.    Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater insists these negatives are largely Mr. Reagan's, but such an analysis leaves Mr. Bush little identity of his own. Hubert Humphrey ran as the successor to a less popular Lyndon Johnson at the height of the Vietnam war, yet Gallup polls never measured the Democrat's negatives as high as Mr. Bush's.    &quot;Times have changed, and the media is on a search-and-destroy mission these days,&quot; says Roger Ailes, a Bush consultant who worked against Mr. Humphrey for Richard Nixon in 1968. &quot;If you ask people are they doing well, they say yes. If you ask them about the world, they think it's going to hell in a hand basket.&quot;    Mr. Bush's negatives come from being part of that public world, but he brings a dimension of his own. Voters in the Journal/NBC poll regarded him as less caring about their problems than Mr. Dukakis, and he is seen in a recent New York Times-CBS survey as more attached to special interests. His ambivalence toward his own upper-class background -- he casts Yale as less elite than Harvard -- may make voters wonder if he comprehends their lives any better.    The vice president's problem isn't one of compassion so much as his perceived understanding. &quot;It's not doing what they do but relating to where they're at,&quot; says Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who mocks Mr. Bush's vain efforts to be &quot;one of the guys&quot; at gas pumps or behind the wheel of a truck. In his effort to project a stronger image, Mr. Hart says, the vice president also has erred by responding in a physical sense. &quot;It's not that Dukakis is big and strapping, but there's a resolve to the person,&quot; he says.    The result, suggests Democratic consultant Robert Squier, is that the vice president seems less himself than a preppy parody of a tough-talking good ole boy.    The Journal/NBC poll found that women are less likely than men to see Mr. Bush as caring. And although women felt, 44% to 34%, that the vice president would be better able than Mr. Dukakis to maintain a strong national defense, the poll found that the numbers almost reversed, 46% to 39%, as women picked Mr. Dukakis over the vice president in a time of crisis.    Surveys done by the Washington firm of Hamilton, Frederick andamp; Schneiders support the notion that Mr. Bush's negatives are soft enough that he can save himself, but the same data indicate that his predicament is more complicated than his handlers acknowledge. Given an opportunity to explain their disapproval of Mr. Bush, voters were quicker to cite weakness and dishonesty as issues, for example, than they were to cite the vice president's ties to Mr. Reagan and his policies.    Mr. Bush's campaign manager, Mr. Atwater, says the campaign's salvation lies in issues and dismisses the comments of a top Bush staffer that the vice president can afford to run on personality and background. &quot;Neither one of the candidates has much of an individual identity,&quot; says Mr. Atwater. The Bush campaign has tested voters on those issues that can accentuate differences -- and bring up the Democratic candidate's negatives.    This strategy is behind recent attacks on Mr. Dukakis; GOP literature in the South pegs the Massachusetts governor as a &quot;liberal&quot; and suggests he is less than &quot;straightforward&quot; -- in his character. Mr. Dukakis counters by stumping the region delivering an anti-drug, anti-crime message that stakes his own claim to personal strength and toughness.    Mr. Bush has the knowledge accumulated over years in public office, including a stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, but has been slow to develop issue positions. And though no blame has been attached to the vice president, he is put on the defensive by questions about his knowledge of the Iran-Contra scandal or of U.S. intelligence payments to Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega.    &quot;His strongest asset is his biggest negative,&quot; says New York media consultant David Garth, who contends that the question many people would like Mr. Bush to answer is: &quot;Why are you unaware of everything that's happened in a 10-mile radius of where you were sitting?&quot;    ---                       Negative Ratings   Unfavorable ratings of presidential candidates before fall campaign                                            UNFAVORABLE Barry Goldwater (May 1964) ....................... 36% George McGovern (August 1972) .................... 27% Jimmy Carter (May 1980) .......................... 28% Walter Mondale (July 1984) ....................... 29% George Bush (June 1988) .......................... 40%   Source: Gallup Poll</TEXT></DOC>
