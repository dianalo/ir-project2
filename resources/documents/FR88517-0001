As with adults, the decision of whether to detainor release a juvenile depends on the likelihood that the alien will appearfor all future proceedings. However, with respect to juveniles a determinationmust also be made as to whose custody the juvenile should be released.On the one hand, the concern for the welfare of the juvenile will not permitrelease to just any adult. On the other hand, the Service has neither theexpertise nor the resources to conduct home studies for placement of eachjuvenile released. This rule strikes a balance by providing a list of appropriatecustodians while maintaining the discretion of the District Director orChief Patrol Agent to release a juvenile to an adult other than those listedindividuals in unusual and compelling circumstances.The Immigration and Naturalization Service published a notice of proposedrulemaking on the Detention and Release of Juveniles in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on October 15, 1987. Twelve comments were receivedin response to the proposed rule. The provisions of the proposed rule whichreceived significant comment will be discussed separately.The final rule amends 8 CFR Part 242 by adding a new andSection; 242.24 dealingwith detention and release of juveniles. The rule also amends 8 CFR Part212 by revising andSection; 212.5(a)(2)(ii) to provide that parole determinationsregarding juveniles will be made pursuant to the criteria set out in andSection;242.24. This rule thus provides a single policy for juveniles in both deportationand exclusion proceedings.Several commenters suggested that the list of custodians in the proposedrule is restrictive and should be expanded to include any responsible adult.The Service has attempted to provide for release to those individuals consideredresponsible for the juvenile's welfare. Release to others beyond theseindividuals on a routine basis, would require the performance of home studiesfor which the Service is neither adequately funded nor qualified. Furthermore,the rule permits the District Director or Chief Patrol Agent to exercisehis discretion to release to a responsible adult other than those listedin unusual and compelling circumstances.We agree with comments that the juvenile's interests are best served whenthe juvenile is placed in a home or shelter-care environment. In fact,the regulations contemplate placement in a shelter care facility as thepreferred detention alternative. However, juveniles placed in shelter-carewill still be considered to be in INS detention because of issues of paymentand authorization of medical care. This preference in the regulations forshelter-care facilities is consistent with provisions of 18 U.S.C. 5035for detention of juveniles prior to a disposition of delinquency charges.Based on the foregoing, the Service has determined that the list of suitablecustodians shall remain as listed in the proposed rule.One commenter suggested that the use of the word ``may'' in andSection; 242.24(b)(1)should be changed to ``shall'' to indicate that release to such adultsshould be a matter of course. This suggestion has been incorporated. However,to maintain the discretion of the Service on a case-by-case basis the language``unless a determination is made that the detention of such juvenile isrequired to secure his timely appearance before the Service or the immigrationcourt or to ensure the juvenile's safety or that of others'' has been addedin the final rule.Several commenters requested that andSection; 242.24(b)(2) be amended toclarify that the term ``adult relatives'' are the same as those set outin andSection; 242.24(b)(1)(iii). This has been clarified in the final rule.Several commenters criticized the fact that the rule contains no guidanceregarding the term ``unusual and compelling circumstances.'' This omissionwas intentional. The intent of the regulation is to provide Service officialswith the broadest possible discretion so that each case may be viewed basedon a totality of the juvenile's circumstances. Any attempt to define theterm would only serve to limit that discretion and thus limit its favorableexercise. Accordingly, this suggestion has not been adopted.One commenter indicated confusion regarding the release of a juvenile toa detained person as set forth in andSection; 242.24(b)(2). The intentionof the rule is to provide for a simultaneous release of the juvenile andthe detained adult. This point has been clarified in the final rule. One commenter indicated that the proposed rule would require a parent orguardian who is lawfully residing in the United States to travel to a distantlocation far from his home to secure the juvenile's release. This was notour intention. The final rule has been amended to permit a parent or guardianseeking a juvenile's release pursuant to andSection; 242.24(b)(1) to securerelease at an INS office located near the parent's or guardian's residencewhen the juvenile is being detained at a distant location.One commenter suggested that the requirement in andSection; 242.24(b)(3)for an affidavit to be sworn before an immigration officer or a consularofficer is unrelated to concerns for the child's welfare or the child'sappearance at INS proceedings and affidavits executed before a notary publicshould be accepted. To the contrary, this requirement is imposed for thepurpose of ensuring that the INS is actually receiving the wishes of theparent or guardian. Because of the seriousness with which we view releaseof a juvenile to an unrelated adult, the Service is unwilling to simplyrely on notarized documents for this assurance.One commenter indicated that the proposed rule does not provide promptnotice to juveniles of restrictions on their release. The INS is developinga simplified form for this purpose which will be provided within twenty-four(24) hours of arrest to each juvenile apprehended who has not been released.One commenter suggested that the proposed rule failed to consider the court'sorder in <T3>Perez-Funez</T3> v. <T3>District Director, INS,</T3> 619 F. Supp. 656 (D.C. Cal, 1985). Inthat case, the court ordered the Service to provide access to telephonesand (except for class members residing permanently in Mexico or Canada)ensure that the class member has in fact communicated by telephone or otherwise,with a parent, close adult relative, friend, or a free legal services organizationprior to presentation of the voluntary departure form. The proposed ruleprovided for a Notice and Request for Disposition (``Perez-Funez Advisal'')be given to the juvenile upon apprehension. In order to clarify the responsibilitiesof the INS with respect to <T3>Perez-Funez</T3> class members, the language of the court's order hasbeen incorporated in the final rule.Several commenters requested the Service to consider permitting an individualor an organization to act as an intermediary between the INS and the parent,guardian, or other custodian to facilitate the release of juvenile aliens.According to the comments, parents or guardians who are unlawfully presentin the United States are unwilling to come forward to the INS to securerelease of the child for fear of being apprehended. This proposal raisessome of the same concerns that release to any reliable adult raises, forexample, the inability of the Service to perform home studies. However,while the proposal has not been incorporated into the final rule at thistime, it has not been rejected. The Service will continue to consider theproposal, but it was felt that such further review should not delay publicationof this final rule.Two commenters recommended that the term ``state or local juvenile facilities''not encompass ``juvenile correctional facilities.'' The Service sharesthe concern that administrative juvenile detainees not be placed in detentionwith convicted offenders. For this reason the Service is developing contractswith shelter-care facilities in all locations. However, in certain areasshelter-care facilities are not yet available. This may necessitate theuse of a secure facility for a short term period. In all cases where thisis necessary, INS juvenile detainees will not be mixed with the generalpopulation of the facility. If we were to limit the use of secure facilitiesat this point, the Service would be required to move juveniles to otherlocations in order to detain them. This would not serve the juveniles'best interest.Two commenters suggested that the preamble to the final rule should includea statement that release of minors to parents or adult relatives is thepreferred method of dealing with juvenile offenders. We agree. The paramountconcern of the INS with respect to minors in custody is the welfare ofthe minor. In this regard it is the position of the Service that reunificationof the juvenile with his or her family is in the best interest of all concerned.Accordingly, the final rule provides that the minor ``shall'' be releasedto a parent, legal guardian or adult relative ``unless a determinationis made that the detention of such juvenile is required to secure his timelyappearance before the Service or the immigration court or to ensure thejuvenile's safety or that of others.'' Thus, under the final rule reunificationrepresents Service policy, with detention being the exception.One commenter questioned the nature of the agreement to be signed by thedesignated adult. The agreement is a written statement made under oaththat the adult will care for the juvenile and ensure the juvenile's presenceat all future proceedings before the Service or the immigration court.This agreement may, in any given case, be required to be accompanied byan appearance bond.Another commenter requested that the final rule incorporate standards ofdetention and other conditions of confinement for juvenile detainees. Standardsof confinement are beyond the scope of this particular rule which is limitedto processing and release. However, the Service has developed standardsof confinement which are incorporated in its contracts for shelter-carefacilities.Finally, one commenter suggested that the position of ``juvenile coordinator''be outside the supervision of the Enforcement Branch. This strictly administrativedecision is outside the scope of the rulemaking. However, the Service isconsidering this recommendation in its decision.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) the Commissioner of the Immigrationand Naturalization Service certifies that this rule will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule isnot a major rule within the definition of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>8 CFR Part 212Administrative practice and procedure, Parole, Juveniles.8 CFR Part 242Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Juveniles.Accordingly, Chapter I of Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations isamended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 212_DOCUMENTARY REQUIREMENTS: NONIMMIGRANTS; WAIVERS; ADMISSIONOF CERTAIN INADMISSIBLE ALIENS; PAROLE</ITAG>1.
