They didn't go to the Sun Belt.   The Powers retired north, to Michigan's Upper Peninsula, aflannel-shirted place even on July nights, famous for arduouswinters and mosquito-bit summers.   ``Land of the Loon,'' the T-shirts say.   The Powers could have flocked south like so much of America'sretiring public, but it was in these snowbirds' minds to headinstead toward Canada.   ``I think Florida is pretty crowded and in my opinion, there arenot enough young people there,'' she said. ``All you do in Floridais get behind some large car going 10 miles an hour.''   Older Americans are a moving lot. The U.S. Bureau of the Censuscalculates that last year, 5.3 percent of those over 65 changedhomes, one out of five of them settling in another state.   From 1975 to 1980, more than 9 percent of those over 60 moved outof their home cities while another 13.4 percent moved within theirtowns, said Dr. Charles Longino, a University of Miami researcherwho spent six years studying the migration.   Warmer, dryer weather and lifestyle amenities like year-roundgolf continue to draw most retirees south and west, said Don Fowles,a statistician for the U.S. Administration on Aging in Washington,D.C. ``People are more sensitive to cold as they grow older.''   A minority of the affluent elderly seek colder climates, as didthe Powers. Virginia, 67, and Tom, 68, found their haven on the tipof the Garden Peninsula, a remote spit of land on the north shore ofLake Michigan.   There is only one paved road down the peninsula. The largesttown, Garden, has just a single grocery store and two bars. Most ofthe residents are farmers, loggers or fishermen.   ``After living in an area as congested as Detroit, you need thespace the North provides,'' Virginia said. ``I think most retireesfind it so blissful up here, with the clean air and the space.   ``There's no fear, and it's such a relaxed feeling,'' she said.``There's a friendlier attitude up here.''   There also are economic reasons for flying north.   The bottom dropped out of the Upper Peninsula's economy fiveyears ago. Homes entered the market at rock bottom prices as ironore mines closed and workers moved away to find jobs.   The economy has picked up since then, but housing remains abargain. A decent three-bedroom home in the Upper Peninsula goes for$30,000, and $100,000 will buy you a dream house on the shore, saidEscanaba real estate agent Jeanne Bonefeld. Her son in Florida tellsher the same homes sell for two to three times as much among theorange groves.   The ruggedness has its definite disadvantages. Tom broke his legrecently when he was hit by a falling cedar tree. The closesthospital was more than an hour away, although the local ambulancearrived within 15 minutes.   And when Tom needed arterial bypass surgery two years ago, thePowers elected to use a hospital in Green Bay, Wis.   Retirees living in the North Woods may find themselves isolated,financially and geographically, from health care.   A hearing in Houghton Lake held by Michigan's Office of Servicesto the Aging in June turned up tales of 20-mile ambulance rides tothe nearest hospital costing from $400 to $1,000 each. ``We need todetermine if they're paying actual costs or if they're beingbilked,'' said Mary Lindemann, with the state agency in Lansing.   And then there is the snow.   Delta County gets an average 56 inches of snowfall a winter _more on the Garden Peninsula since it is surrounded by water _ sothe Powers own a snowblower and clear their 1,100-foot drivewaythemselves.   Their road is too narrow for a commercial plow. The Powers couldwiden it, but that would ruin the remote atmosphere, Virginia says.   ``It takes the kind of person who likes the isolation. We enjoyhaving the elbow room. We had lived cheek by jowl in town and wewere looking for someplace else,'' she said.   The Powers have found a definite change of pace since theirworking days _ he as a school administrator and she as a high schoolEnglish teacher _ outside of Detroit.   ``Chickadees eat out of our hands. I identified 42 differentkinds of wild flowers in my yard. I press flowers and make bookmarksand make pine cone wreaths and I knit chair cushions and send themoff to my friends. You have time,'' Virginia said.   ``We never realized how beautiful a sunset was and we neverrealized how far north the sun moves in the summer, how far south inthe winter.''</TEXT></DOC>
