<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-37-0149 </DOCNO><TEXT>We report on an extensive study of energy deficit measurements of theenergy distribution of the ion beam emitted by a gallium liquid metalion source, in an attempt to resolve the controversy arising from theunusually wide divergence of findings by different workers. A detailedinvestigation is also made for the region of emission current below 1{mu}A. Finally, the scatter observed in energy spread measurements isattributed to ion source misalignment; this misalignment arises fromthe fact that the liquid cone does not always form at the centre of theapex region of the supporting needle.</TEXT></DOC>
