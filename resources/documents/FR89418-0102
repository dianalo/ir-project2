Description of the Proposal </ITAG>The proposal amends OCC By-Laws and Rules to provide for the issuance,clearance, and settlement of IPs. An IP is a product whose value is determinedby reference to the value of an underlying stock index.\9\<NOTE/> IPs were designed to place the holder of an IP in an economicposition substantially equivalent to that of a purchaser of a portfolioor basket of stocks comprising the underlying index. A holder of an IPwould be entitled to receive, and the writer of an IP would be obligatedto pay, a quarterly dividend equivalent. The dividend equivalent wouldequal the regular cash dividends accrued over the quarter which the ownerof a basket of stocks described above would be entitled to receive; itwould not include stock dividends or extraordinary cash dividends. An IPwould exist until the holder or writer extinguishes the IP by enteringinto an offsetting writing or purchasing transaction, or exercises a ``cash-outprivilege'' that is available, depending on the IP, on a daily, quarterlyor semi-annual basis. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The Phlx has designated two indexes for CIP trading: theBlue Chip Index, a price-weighted index composed of 25 highly capitalizedlisted common stock issues representing primarily industrial corporationswhich is designed to reflect the performance of the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage (``DJIA''), and the Standard andamp; Poors 500 (``Sandamp;P'' 500)Index. The Amex EIPs will be based on the Major Market Index (``XMI'')and the Sandamp;P 500 Index. CBOE VIPs will be based on the capitalization-weightedCBOE 50 and CBOE 250 indexes developed and maintained by the Exchange,and the Sandamp;P 500 Index. All IPs covering the same index group and havingidentical contract terms constitute a ``class of IPs.'' The cash-out privilege provides for a payment in cash based upon the currentvalue of the component stocks of the underlying index at the time specifiedby each exchange during which the privilege is available.\10\<NOTE/> For example, Phlx's proposed IP rules provide that the cash-outprivilege would be available to holders of IPs on any business day. Pursuantto the proposed Phlx rules, however, exercise of the cash-out privilegewould entitle an exercising holder to an ``aggregate cash-out value'' \11\<NOTE/> computed in a different manner depending on the day of exercise.If the CIP holder exercises on the business day before an IP dividend equivalentday, the aggregate cash-out value would be based on the opening valuesof the stocks in the underlying index on the IP dividend equivalent day.If the CIP holder exercises on any other business day, the aggregate cash-outvalue would be based on the closing index value on the business day followingthe exercise, reduced by one-half of one percent. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ The days on which the cash-out privilege is availablefor IPs traded on each Exchange are stated in Interpretations added toOCC's Rules. Generally, the cash-out time for each quarterly or semi-annualperiod, depending on the IP, will be determined and made public by eachExchange before the beginning of such period. Amex has determined thatits cash-out time will coincide with ``dividend equivalent day''_the thirdFriday of March, June, September and December. <T3>See</T3> Rule 1903, Interpretations and policies .02, .03 and .04.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Aggregate cash-out value is equal to the settlement indexvalue times the index multiplier times the minimum trading unit. The Exchangeshave determined that the minimum unit of trading in IPs shall be 100 IPs,unless otherwise designated by the Exchange. OCC By-Laws, Article XVIII,Section 1. For CBOE VIPs, each writer as well as each holder would be entitled toa cash-out privilege on a semi-annual basis. These IPs therefore are referredto in OCC's proposed rules as ``two-way IPs.'' The writer's cash-out privilegewould entitle the writer to extinguish the short position and pay the cash-outvalue. Holders of two-way IPs would have a corresponding obligation, uponassignment of a writer's exercise notice, to extinguish long IP positionsin exchange for payment of the cash-out value. On the Amex, EIP holders would be entitled to exercise either the cash-outprivilege or a delivery privilege on a quarterly basis. EIP holders couldreceive either the cash-out value or, under certain circumstances, physicaldelivery of shares of the component stocks of the Sandamp;P 500 Index orthe Major Market Index. EIPs for which the delivery privilege has beenexercised are referred to as ``physical IPs'' in OCC Rules. Specifically,the holder of one or more delivery units\12\<NOTE/> that has not chosen to exercise the cash-out privilege hasthe right to obtain on each delivery time, which coincides with the quarterlycash-out time, the physical delivery of a proportionate number of sharesof each stock comprising the underlying index, subject to certain conditions.A delivery fee established by the Amex would be charged to the EIP holdertaking physical delivery of the component stocks. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ The term ``delivery unit'' regarding any class of physicalIPs means the unit, consisting of the minimum number of trading units ofsuch IPs specified by the Exchange, for which the delivery privilege maybe exercised. the Amex has established the delivery unit as 500 minimumtrading units for the Sandamp;P 500 Index and 250 minimum trading units forthe XMI. OCC By-Laws, Article XVIII, section 1. <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 26243 (November 2, 1988),53 FR 45407, and 26355 (December 13, 1988), 53 FR 51181, for a detaileddiscussion of the physical delivery aspect of Amex's proposal. Exercise notices requesting physical delivery of one or more delivery unitswill be assigned first, on a random basis, to those short EIP positionsthat have notified OCC of a desire to make physical delivery (``physicalassignment volunteers''). If the number of delivery units for which holdershave requested physical delivery exceeds the number of units made availablefor delivery by persons with short EIP positions, an Amex-designated ``deliveryfacilitator'' would assume responsibility for delivering the physical sharesfor such excess number of units.\13\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ The delivery facilitator would be an OCC clearing memberthat is a member organization of the exchange. OCC By-Laws, Article XVIII,Section I. Initially, the Amex contemplates designating only one facilitatorper EIP class and notes that the facilitator may be the specialist unitfor that class of EIPs. <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26355 (December 13, 1988),53 FR 51181. In proposing rules that would provide for the issuance, clearance, andsettlement of IPs, OCC has, where appropriate, paralleled its existingrules and procedures. The proposal consists of a new Chapter XIX to OCCRules applicable to IPs; amendments to Chapter VI dealing with margin;amendments to Chapter X to provide for a clearing fund contribution forIPs; revisions to the close-out provisions in Chapter XI; and conformingchanges to Rules 207, 401, and 402 dealing with records and trade reporting.In addition, the proposal amends a number of OCC By-Laws and adds a newArticle XVIII dealing exclusively with IPs. A. Processing of IPs OCS would process IP transactions in accordance with procedures that aresubstantially similar to OCC's well-established system for processing equityand non-equity option (``NEO'') transactions. As discussed in more detailbelow, OCC would receive compared trade data from the exchanges, issueand (in the case of closing transactions) cancel the appropriate contracts.OCC would make appropriate book entries to clearing members' accounts representingthe long and short positions in each account.\14\<NOTE/> IP transactions would settle through OCC's existing systemson a next-day basis in same-day funds.\15\<NOTE/> OCC would collect margin on short IP positions. As discussedbelow, CIPs, VIPs, and certain EIPs are cash-settled. Therefore, OCC wouldprocess exercises and assignments according to procedures similar to thosefor NEO securities. On the other hand, certain EIPs provide the holderthe right to physical delivery of the securities that comprise the index.Settlement of exercises and assignments regarding these physical IPs wouldbe effected through designated stock clearing corporations. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ IPs would be uncertificated securities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ The proposed IP rules provide that OCC reserves the rightto pay clearing members by issuance of an uncertified check for the netsettlement amount. For example, OCC's proposed system for processing exercises and assignmentsof the IP cash-out privilege generally parallels the system for processingexercises and assignments of NEO and equity securities. Specifically, clearingmembers exercising the cash-out privilege would tender exercise noticesto OCC between 10:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) \16\<NOTE/> on any day such exercises are permitted. In accordance withits existing procedures, OCC would accept all properly tendered exercisenotices on the date of tender (``T'') and would assign, pursuant to itsprocedures for random selection,\17\<NOTE/> exercise notices in connection with the cash-out privilegesubmitted by exercising IP holders (or writers, in the case of two-dayIPs) to clearing members with short positions (or long positions, in thecase of two-way IPs) in that class of IP. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ All times referred to herein are Eastern Time. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Relesae No. 21899 (March 27, 1985),50 FR 13444, approving OCC's revised random asssignment procedures. OCC would calculate the aggregate cash-out value\18\<NOTE/> for each class of IPs on T+2 (``exercise settlement date'')and would net the exercise settlement amounts to be paid by the clearingmember against the exercise settlement amounts to be paid to the clearingmember to obtain a single net settlement amount for IP exercises and assignmentsfor each account of each clearing member. Prior to 8:00 a.m. on exercisesettlement date, OCC would issue a report to clearing members advisingthem of their cash delivery and receive obligations. OCC would be authorizedto draft clearing members' bank accounts at or before 10:00 a.m., and wouldbe obligated to credit clearing members' bank accounts at or before 11:00a.m., as appropriate, is satisfaction of net settlement amounts. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ Aggregate cash-out value is equal to the settlement indexvalue (based on the opening trades of the index's component stocks on T+1)as reported by the exchange or the reporting service designated by theexchange, times the index multiplier times the minimum trading unit. Ifthe settlement index value is not reported to OCC in a timely manner, OCCwould be authorized to suspend settlement regarding that class of IPs andto fix a new exercise settlement date. The settlement index value as initiallyreported would be presumed to be accurate and would be final for purposesof calculating the aggregate cash-out value. With respect to a feature of Amex EIPs, however, a holder could exercisethe delivery privilege, instead of the cash-out privilege, by tenderingan exercise notice to OCC between 10:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. on any day suchexercises are permitted. Additionally, an EIP writing clearing member desiringto become, or acting on behalf of an EIP writer that desires to become,a physical assignment volunteer would tender to OCC a physical assignmentvolunteer notice between 10:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. on any day which exercisesare permitted regarding such IPs. Again, OCC would accept all properlytendered exercise notices and would accept properly tendered physical assignmentvolunteer notices to the extent they equal or are exceeded by the numberof delivery units to which physical delivery exercise notices have beenaccepted by OCC. If the number of delivery units for which physical assignmentvolunteer notices were submitted was smaller than the number of physicaldelivery exercise notices tendered to OCC, OCC would randomly assign asufficient number of exercise notices in connection with the delivery privilegeto non-volunteering physical IP writers to make up the imbalance. Thesewriters would be required to pay to OCC the aggregate cash-out value onT+2. OCC then would notify the delivery facilitator,\19\<NOTE/> before the opening of trading on the next business day, ofthe amount of the imbalance and it would buy the necessary shares to makeup the baskets of deliverable stock in the opening transactions on therelevant markets.\20\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ In the event that the agreement of a delivery facilitatorto act as such, or the delivery facilitator's status as an OCC clearingmember is terminated or suspended prior to the opening of trading on thetrading day following the day on which an IP is exercised for deliveryof stock, OCC would have the right to pay the cash-out value in lieu ofstock to the extent that the exercise was assigned to the delivery facilitatorrather than a volunteer writer. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ The delivery facilitator would buy at the opening becausethe aggregate cash-out value paid by non-volunteering phsyical IP writerswould be based on the value of the underlying index calculated using openingvalues. Delivery privilege exercises and assignment of delivery privilege exercisesto physical assignment volunteers would be settled through the facilitiesof designated clearing corporations. Following the close of trading onthe business day following the day on which delivery privilege exercisenotices have been accepted by OCC, OCC would report the net amount of deliverablestock to be received or delivered to the designated clearing corporationof each clearing member. Clearing members making delivery would pay toOCC, and OCC would pay to the clearing member entitled to receive delivery,the entire ``aggregate delivery value'' \21\<NOTE/> of each delivery unit on the morning of the sixth businessday following the day on which a delivery privilege exercise notice isproperly tendered to OCC (``T+6'' or ``exercise settlement date''). Underthis method, each clearing member entitled to receive delivery would thenpay its designated clearing corporation the appropriate price for eachcomponent stock on T+6.\22\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ Aggregate delivery regarding a delivery unit of IPs refersto the value of such delivery unit, equal to the aggregate cash-value timesthe delivery unit. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ Settlement at stock clearing corporations generally isby payment of certified check in clearinghouse (<T3>i.e,</T3> next-day) funds. OCC has designed a new rule to deal with a feature unique to IPs_the dividendequivalent. Proposed Rule 1902 provides that the exchange notify OCC oneach day prior to an IP dividend equivalent day the amount of the dividendequivalent to be received by IP holders and paid by IP writers on dividendequivalent day. The amount of the dividend equivalent is determined bythe exchange on which the IP is traded based upon the regular cash dividendspaid on stocks comprising the underlying index through the quarterly period.OCC, in turn, would notify clearing members prior to 8:00 a.m. on dividendequivalent day of their obligation to pay to OCC or to receive from OCCthe net IP dividend equivalent.\23\<NOTE/> The procedures for payments of dividend equivalents wouldconform to other settlement procedure provisions in OCC Rules, as discussedabove. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ OCC would be obligated to pay clearing members that areentitled to dividend equivalents even if OCC does not receive a paymentfrom a clearing member that owes OCC dividend equivalents. OCC would usethe defaulting clearing member's margin deposits and clearing fund contributionto pay the amount of the dividend equivalent to the clearing member entitledto receive it. If a defaulting clearing member's margin deposit and clearingfund contribution are inadequate, OCC would assess pro rata all clearingmembers' clearing fund contributions to the NEO clearing fund. B. MarginAs the issuer of IPs, OCC guarantees the performance of clearing memberIP writers and holders. To collateralize this guarantee in the event aclearing member defaults, OCC requires writing clearing members to, amongother things, deposit margin with OCC.\24\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ OCC's margin requirements apply only to OCC clearingmembers and should not be confused with the minimum margin that must bemaintained in customer accounts as set by the exchanges in accordance withRegulation T of the Federal Reserve Board (``FRB''). OCC generally would calculate clearing member margin requirements for shortIP positions in a manner similar to that used for OCC's NEO margin system.\25\<NOTE/> The NEO margin system has two components_premium margin,which can be a requirement or a credit, and additional margin. The term``premium margin'' used in respect of IPs means the number of minimum tradingunits times the current highest asked price (or, in the case of exercisedor assigned IP positions, times the aggregate current index value). ``Additionalmargin'' is calculated by determining assumed maximum one-day price movementsin the underlying assets and projecting the effect of such movements onthe liquidating value of the position on the basis of options pricing models.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ OCC's NEO margin system employs a portfolio evaluationmethodology using options price theory to project the cost of liquidatinga portfolio of positions in the event of an assumed ``worst case'' changein the price of the underlying interests. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 23167 (April 22, 1986),51 FR 16127, in which the Commission approved OCC's NEO margin system.Because IPs do not have an exercise price or expiration date, the ``series''concept for option contracts would not apply. OCC would not differentiateamong IPs based on the same underlying index, and a class group, <T3>i.e.</T3>, IPs based on the same underlying index, would include onlyone class of IPs. The proposal also would extend the product group conceptto IPs, so that a class group consisting of a class of IPs may be marginedon a combined basis with other class groups of IPs or index options, whereOCC has determined that their respective underlying indexes exhibit sufficientprice correlation to warrant such margin treatment. For example, a classgroup consisting of the XMI EIP could be combined with a class group consistingof the Sandamp;P 500 EIP, CIP and VIP for margin calculations because theyboth belong to the broad-based indexes product group.\26\<NOTE/> Moreover, these class groups could be combined with indexoptions such as the XMI option traded on the Amex, and the Sandamp;P 100and Sandamp;P 500 Index options traded on the CBOE, because these, too, belongto the broad-based indexes product group.\27\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ A haircut would be applied to additional margin creditsto account for the lack of perfect correlation between class groups. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ OCC would not provide margin credit for unsegregatedlong physical IP positions in a clearing member's customer's account asto which the delivery privilege has been exercised, on and after the secondbusiness day after tender of the exercise notice, because OCC would notbe able to control the long value of the position on and after that day.When writers assigned exercises of the cash-out privilege pay OCC the aggregatecash-out value on exercise settlement date on T+2, OCC would release marginheld in respect of those positions. OCC would continue to require marginfrom clearing members with the obligation to deliver stock until exercisesettlement day for physical delivery on T+6. The delivery facilitator,however, would be required only to post additional margin (<T3>i.e.</T3>, margin to cover OOC's exposure to an adverse market moveduring the day on which it was required to buy deliverable stock), andnot premium margin because the assigned writers would be obligated to OCCfor that amount, and that obligation would be secured by the margin depositsof those writers.\28\<NOTE/> Because IPs would be margined under OCC's NEO margin system,the proposal provides that each clearing member's contribution to the NEOclearing fund would be calculated on the basis of margin requirements forIPs as well as NEOs.\29\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ In effect, the delivery facilitator would receive a margincredit equal to the sum of the aggregate cash-out values paid to OCC inconnection with assignments of physical delivery exercises, because OCCwould be holding that amount pending settlement with the delivery facilitatoron exercise settlement day. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ Delivery facilitators would not be required to contributeto OCC's NEO clearing fund on account of their facilitating activitiesunless they otherwise carry IP or NEO positions. The proposal also would extend OCC's Pledge Program to IPs thereby allowingclearing members to obtain financing by pledging long IPs as collateralto support loans from banks or other clearing members. Additionally, IPswould be eligible to be pledged from segregated (customer) accounts. Inthis regard, Phlx and Amex requested an interpretation from the FRB \30\<NOTE/> that IPs be treated as equity securities for purposes ofthe relevant provisions of Regulation T.\31\<NOTE/> Thus, the exchanges proposed that IPs be margined like commonstock.\32\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the FRB staff issued a letter not objectingto the commencement of IPs trading employing the proposed initial and maintenancemargin for IPs.\33\<NOTE/> Therefore, long IP positions in a customer account that constitutecustomer margin securities would be able to be pledged to secure obligationsof the carrying broker to the same extent as common stock.\34\<NOTE/> Amendment No. 3 makes explicit that IPs could be transferredinto and out of pledge accounts only in multiples of minimum trading units.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ <T3>See </T3>letters to Laura Homer, Securities Credit Officer, FRB, fromRichard T. Chase, Executive Vice President, Phlx, dated February 3, 1988,and from Gordon L. Nash, Senior Executive Vice President, Legal and RegulatoryAffairs, Amex, dated March 8, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ <T3>See </T3>12 C.F.R. 220.5(c) and 220.18 (a), (c), and (f) (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ <T3>See </T3>Exchange approval order at 65-66. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ <T3>See </T3>letter from Laura Homer, Securities Credit Officer, FRB, toRichard Ketchum, Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated March20, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ OCC's proposed rules require the clearing member to representthat all IPs pledged from customer accounts constitute margin securities.<T3>See </T3>OCC Rule 611. C. Suspension of an IP Clearing Member The proposal would amend existing OCC Rules dealing with suspension ofa clearing member to incorporate references to IPs. Because failure topay a dividend equivalent or to meet settlement obligations with respectto IPs is necessarily a failure to meet a daily money obligation to OCC,OCC's proposed rules would provide for the application of its existingsuspension rules and the disposition of settlement obligations throughthe Liquidating Settlement Account.\35\<NOTE/> OCC would close out short IP positions \36\<NOTE/> of a suspended clearing member, like uncovered short optionpositions, in the most orderly manner practicable. Any dividend equivalentsthat may be owed regarding short IP positions of a suspended clearing memberwould be withdrawn from the Liquidating Settlement Account. Proposed rule1908 expressly would state that the suspension of a clearing member inthe course of cash-out privilege exercise settlement would not affect thesettlement procedures applicable to other clearing members. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ <T3>See </T3>OCC Rule 1104. The Liquidating Settlement Account is a specialaccount created upon the suspension of an OCC clearing member. The accountconsists of the suspended clearing member's assets on deposit with OCC,including margin deposits, securities held in bulk, and that member's OCcclearing fund contributions. OCC closes out a suspended clearing member'soutstanding obligations to OCC through transactions in this account. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ Currently, there are no ``covered short IP positions''and the provisions of the rules that address these positions would haveno effect. OCC has filed a separate rule change that would set out therequirements for IP escrow receipts. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26435 (January 10, 1989),54 FR 1832. The Commission currently is reviewing this proposal. Proposed Rule 1908 would provide close-out procedures in the event a clearingmember that is obligated to deliver stock fails to perform, or a clearingmember that is entitled to receive deliverable stock is suspended beforeits designated clearing corporation becomes obligated to make settlementfor the deliverable stock. In the former case, OCC would direct clearingmembers entitled to receive deliverable stock, <T3>i.e., </T3>the clearing member matched against the non-performing clearingmember in the stock trades reported to the stock clearing corporations,to buy in the stock for the account and liability of OCC, and settle thebuy-in as quickly as possible after it occurred. In the latter case, OCCwould direct delivering clearing members to sell out the deliverable stockand pay the proceeds of the sale to OCC. The proposal also would amend OCC's By-Laws. Among other things, a newArticle dealing with IPs provides definitions applicable to IPs, most ofwhich parallel the definitions used regarding index options. The proposedArticle also would set out the general rights and obligations of IP holdersand writers. Additionally, in this Article OCC would reserve the right,on 30 days' notice, to exercise the cash-out privilege on behalf of allholders of a class of IPs, and thereby close out the market in that class,under certain extraordinary circumstances, <T3>e.g., </T3>when there is a lack of regular trading activity in suchclass. The proposal also would amend various OCC By-Laws to accommodate IPs. Amongthese changes, Article I would define ``cleared security'' to include IPsand would clarify that the terms ``exercise'' and ``Exercising ClearingMember'' can refer to exercise of the cash-out privilege in connectionwith IP transactions. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. OCC's Rationale for the Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>OCC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the purposes andrequirements of Section 17A of the Act because it would provide for theprompt and accurate clearance and settlement of transactions in IPs. OCCstates in its filing that the proposed rule applies to IPs rules and proceduressubstantially similar to those that have been used in the clearance andsettlement of transactions in equity and non-equity options. Moreover,OCC believes that the proposed rule change provides for the safeguardingof securities and funds in OCC's custody or control or for which OCC isresponsible, in that it would apply to IPs a system of safeguards whichis substantially the same as the system OCC currently uses for options.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion </ITAG>For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving OCC's proposal.The Commission believes that OCC's proposal is consistent with Section17A of the Act and OCC's obligation to promote the prompt and accurateclearance and settlement of securities transactions and to safeguard securitiesand funds in OCC's custody and control.\37\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ Several commentators expressed the belief that IPs arestock index futures, not securities. That issue is discussed in detailin the order approving the exchanges' proposal to trade IPs and, therefore,is not addressed in this order. This order incorporates the exchanges'approval order rationale for concluding that IPs are securities. <T3>See </T3>note 7, <T3>supra. </T3>Since the October 1987 market-break, a number of studies have recommendedcreating a market basket product.\38\<NOTE/> These studies suggest that such a product could, among otherthings, ameliorate the volatility and steep price declines expeienced duringand since October 1987. These studies also focus on clearance and settlementof equities, options and futures, and the need to develop safe and efficientclearance and settlement systems both within and between markets. The latterfocus is the subject of this filing and order.\39\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>N. Katzenbach, <T3>An Overview of Program Trading and Its Impact on Current Market Practices</T3>(December 21, 1987) and Division of Market Regulation, <T3>The October 1987 Market Break </T3>(February 1988) (``Staff Report'').<T3>See also </T3>Report of the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms(January 1988) and the Interim Report of the Working Group on FinancialMarkets (May 1988) (``Working Group Report'') for other recommendationsarising out of the October 1987 market break. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ <T3>See </T3>Exchange approval order, <T3>supra, </T3>note 7, for a discussion of the benefits of a market basketproduct. The Commission is satisfied that the proposed system for processing IPtransactions is substantially similar to OCC's well-established systemfor processing NEO transactions. The Commission believes that use of thatsystem is well designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance andsettlement of transactions in IPs consistent with section 17A(b)(3) ofthe Act. With certain exceptions for physical IPs and IP dividend equivalentpayments that will be discussed below (as well as the characteristics pertainingto the potential perpetual existence of IPs), the proposed system is identicalto OCC's system for processing NEO transactions. For example, exchangeswill use existing systems to report opening and closing trades in IPs toOCC. Additionally, OCC will maintain records and process opening and closingtransactions,\40\<NOTE/> will process exercise notices in connection with the cash-outprivilege, and will assign those exercises to OCC clearing members withIP positions on the other side of the market in accordance with existingprocedures. Finally, OCC will effect net settlement each day with its clearingmembers for all IP and option transactions, including amounts owed in connectionwith dividend equivalents, pursuant to its well-established settlementprocedures. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ Unlike NEOs where OCC collects the premium from IP purchasersand requires writers to post as margin the premium plus an additional marginamount, OCC would collect from IP purchasers the aggregate index valueand IP writers would be required to post (in the form of cash or otheradequate collateral) the highest asked price or, for exercised or assignedIPs, the aggregate index value, plus an additional margin amount. At least one market break report \41\<NOTE/> noted that efforts to monitor clearing firm risk more effectivelyare critical to reducing risk and increasing confidence in the markets.In connection with this, the report emphasized the need for market participantsto have access on a timely basis to information concerning the specificsize and nature of their payment obligations so that they can make appropriatearrangements to fulfill them. In this regard, the Commission is concernedthat clearing members know their IP dividend equivalent payment obligationin sufficient time to collect the payment from their customers or to arrangefinancing to meet that obligation. The Commission notes that although manyof the indexes underlying IPs are well-established and widely disseminated,there are no arrangements for separately quoting the value of the dividendequivalent at this time. The Commission recognizes that the formulas forcalculating the different index values will be set out in exchange rulesand, therefore, a clearing member could compute the amount due with respectto each IP trading unit from published reports of dividends paid beforedividend equivalent day. Nevertheless, the Commission urges OCC, in themonths after IP trading commences, to monitor the ability of clearing membersto meet their dividend equivalent obligations and to discuss with clearingmembers and the exchanges whether there is a need for earlier disseminationof IP dividend equivalent values.\42\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ <T3>See </T3>Working Group Report, <T3>supra, </T3>note 37. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ Based on experience regarding the actual settlement ofIP dividend equivalent obligations, the Commission will review whetherthe exchanges should make available, on a routine basis, information regardingestimated or accrued dividend equivalents.The Commission agrees with OCC that is is appropriate to include IPs inOCC's existing NEO margin system for OCC clearing members. Like NEOs, IPsgenerally are cash-settled.\43\<NOTE/> In approving the NEO margin system,\44\<NOTE/> the Commission determined that it provided a refined methodologyfor calculating margin, resulting in increased protection to OCC againstadverse price movements in underlying assets. Additionally, recognizingthat no margin system is designed to protect against the most extreme marketmoves, the Staff Report issued in connection with the October market breakgenerally concluded that OCC's NEO margin system is a reliable method ofrisk measurement. Nevertheless, the Commission expects OCC to review andreassess periodically the NEO margin system and to make modifications,where appropriate, to deal safely with more volatile markets.\45\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\43\ Physical IPs, which are settled by delivery of the componentstocks in the underlying index, are discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ <T3>See, supra, </T3>note 25. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ OCC recently completed a review of its margin system.<T3>See </T3>OCC, The Backup System: A Special Study by the Margin CommitteeSubcommittee (August 31, 1988). The subcommittee's report contains a numberof recommendations concerning OCC's margin policies and practices. TheCommission understands that OCC's Board of Directors is considering thoserecommendations and will implement many in the near future. The proposal also extends OCC's Pledge Program to proprietary and marketmaker IP positions. Thus, clearing members will be able to pledge IP positionsmaintained in proprietary and market maker accounts to lenders.\46\<NOTE/> Additionally, because the FRB has determined that IPs maybe treated as margin securities under Regulation T, the proposal wouldextend OCC's Pledge Program to IP positions in customer accounts.\47\<NOTE/> The Commission supports this extension of the Pledge Programbecause it provides clearing members the ability to obtain additional financingthrough the pledge of customer IP positions maintained in margin accounts.Moreover, the Commission believes that use of OCC facilities to conductthis pledge activity should provide greater certainty to banks financingclearing member, broker-dealer, and customer IP positions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ OCC's Pledge Program is a convenient mechanism for processingpledge loans to clearing members because OCC will recognize the pledgee'sinterest in pledge positions. <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 24171 (March 4, 1987),52 FR 7724; 22278 (July 30, 1985), 50 FR 31804; 20994 (May 25, 1984), 49FR 23132; and 19956 (July 19, 1983), 48 FR 33956. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ Long option positions, although they can be paired withshort options to reduce margin requirements, currently have no loan valuefor purposes of Regulation T. The Commission notes that, unlike OCC rules dealing with NEOs, the proposedIP rules provide OCC the authority to exercise the cash-out privilege foran entire class of IPs on thirty days' notice to IP holders and writersin certain limited, extraordinary circumstances. For example, such circumstanceswould include, but are not limited to, a lack of regular trading activityin a class of IPs or the impending termination of business on the partof OCC or the exchange on which that class of IPs is traded. The Commissionagrees with OCC that it should have the ability to terminate a class ofIPs under extraordinary circumstances because, unlike options which expireat a pre-established time, IPs are of unlimited duration. The Commissionrecognizes that in certain circumstances OCC may want to act expeditiouslyto close out a class of IPs. Nevertheless, the Commission notes that OCC'sBy-Laws authorize OCC to exercise the cash-out privilege on a <T3>minimum </T3>of thirty days' notice. The Commission believes this periodprovides sufficient notice to allow market participants to make any neededadjustments to other related securities or futures positions. Nevertheless,given the extraordinary nature of a mandatory cash-out, the Commissionexpects OCC to make every effort to provide more than thirty days' noticewhere possible. The Amex EIP provides holders exercising the delivery privilege the abilityto obtain the basket of securities underlying either the XMI or the Sandamp;P500 Index, thus creating a mechanism for the delivery of a standardizedportfolio of equity securities. An EIP holder exercising the delivery privilegecould obtain shares in as many as 500 companies. To otherwise establishsuch a portfolio would require the purchase of 500 different securities.OCC will process exercises of the delivery privilege in a manner similarto that used for individual equity options with some modifications to reflectthe unique characteristics of EIPs. For example, OCC will report EIP matchedtrade information to the designated clearing corporation reflecting theright of the exercising clearing member to receive shares in each of thecomponent stocks underlying the EIP index and the obligation of eitherthe delivery facilitator or a volunteering writing clearing member, ascontra party to the exercising clearing member, to deliver an equal amountof shares in each of the component stocks. Because matched EIP trades willbe processed in the designated clearing corporation's continuous net settlement(``CNS'') system,\48\<NOTE/> the designated clearing corporation will step between theexercising clearing member and the contra party and, in place of OCC, willguarantee those deliveries. Thus, clearing members will be able to netdeliver and receive obligations in connection with physical EIP exerciseswith other activity in the underlying component stocks. Nevertheless, becausethe designated clearing corporations' CNS systems require clearing membersto pay market value for securities delivered to them and pays to deliveringclearing members the market value of securities they deliver (in satisfactionof their CNS delivery obligations), OCC must provide funds to the clearingmember who will receive securities from the designated clearing corporation(<T3>i.e., </T3>the exercising clearing member) so that the exercising clearingmember can pay the designated clearing corporation and the designted clearingcorporation can pay the delivering clearing member (<T3>i.e., </T3>either the delivery facilitator or a volunteering EIP writer).Because the clearing member exercising the EIP physical delivery privilegepreviously paid the full value of the index for the right to receive thecomponents stocks, OCC and the designated clearing corporations have converteda free delivery obligation into a delivery against payment or receipt againstpayment obligation. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ CNS uses the system price (usually the previous days'reported closing price) to price members' payment obligations. Deliveryand receive obligations are adjusted on a daily basis by a mark-to-the-market.Thus, by paying a mark-to-the-market, a clearing member with a right toreceive can use that long position to offset a delivery obligation thatwill arise tomorrow. In CNS, every right to receive carries the obligationto pay, and every obligation to deliver carries the right to receive thesystem price.The Commission believes it is appropriate to settle exercises of physicalEIPs in this manner because it is consistent with one-account settlement.\4\\9\<NOTE/> The conversion of a free delivery obligation into a deliveryagainst payment obligation, however, raises two concerns about cash flows.The proposed process for settling EIP delivery privilege exercises requirescoordinated funds flow among many parties. The Commission notes that, insuch a system, there is a risk of default by persons holding funds pendingcompletion of the delivery process.\5\\0\<NOTE/> The Commission acknowledges OCC's representations\5\\1\<NOTE/> that discussions are underway with the designated clearingcorporations to develop a more simple process for settling exercises ofphysical EIPs. Nevertheless, the Commission believes it is imperative,within the months after IP trading commences, for OCC and the designatedclearing corporations to design a system through which OCC can pay directlyto the designated clearing corporation cash that would otherwise be paidto the exercising clearing member (perhaps using the margin deposits postedby the assigned EIP holders) on behalf of the exercising clearing member,which would entitle the exercising clearing member to receive securities,subject to daily marks-to-the-market, without payment on delivery.\5\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\9\ Section 17A requires the Commission to facilitate thedevelopment of a national clearance and settlement system. One featureof such a system is one-account settlement, <T3>i.e.</T3>, the ability to clear and settle through one entity all securitiestrades, regardless of the location of the other party to the trade or themarket in which the trade is executed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\0\ For example, generally only broker-dealers hold membershipsin OCC and designated clearing corporations, <T3>e.g.</T3>, National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC''). Therefore,a large institution that maintains EIP positions must rely on the creditworthinessof a broker-dealer in converting its EIP positions to a portfolio of theunderlying securities. If the broker-dealer clearing member fails whileprocessing EIP exercises on behalf of the institutional customer and lossesexceed Securities Investor Protection Corporation (``SIPC'') insurancelimits, that institution may suffer financial loss. Instead of having anidentifiable interest in the underlying securities or the EIPs, the institutionmay share pro rata with all other customers in the pool of customer propertymaintained by the broker-dealer.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\1\ Telephone conversation between Judith Poppalardo, Attorney,SEC, and James R. McDaniel, Schiff Hardin andamp; Waite, on February 3, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\\2\ Such a system exists today at at least one designatedclearing corporation albeit for different purposes. <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25107 (October 1, 1987),52 FR 43959 (approving a recent NSCC rule change that would allow an NSCC-DepositoryTrust Company (``DTC'') member to instruct NSCC to charge the member'ssettlement account for 130% of the value of securities the member anticipatedborrowing, but, in fact, did not receive. NSCC would segregate these fundsin a fully paid-for account. This protects an NSCC-DTC member who makesa security delivery in anticipation of borrowing stock from being out ofcompliance with Rule 15c3-3 under the Act [the customer protection rule],if the stock is not borrowed).On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that OCC's proposedrule change is consistent with the Act and, in particular, with section17A of the Act.Accordingly, <T3>It Is Therefore Ordered</T3>, under section 19(b)(2) of the Act, thatthe proposal (File No. SR-OCC-88-02) be, and hereby is, approved.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 11, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
