Background</ITAG>A. AuthorityUnder 40 CFR 260.20 and 260.22, facilities may petition the Agency to removetheir wastes from hazardous waste control by excluding them from the listsof hazardous wastes contained at 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32. Petitionersmust provide sufficient information to EPA to allow the Agency to determine(1) that the waste to be excluded is not hazardous based upon the criteriafor which it was listed, and (2) that no other hazardous constituents arepresent in the wastes at levels of regulatory concern.B. History of the RulemakingMarquette Electronics, Incorporated, located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, petitionedthe Agency to exclude from hazardous waste control a specific waste thatit generates. After evaluating the petition, EPA proposed, on November8, 1988, to exclude Marquette's waste from the lists of hazardous wasteunder 40 CFR 261.31 and 261.32 (see 53 FR 45106).This rulemaking addresses public comments received on the proposal andfinalizes the proposed exclusion.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Disposition of Delisting Petition</ITAG>Marquette Electronics, Incorporated, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.1. Proposed ExclusionMarquette petitioned the Agency for an exclusion of its wastewater treatmentsludge, presently listed as EPA Hazardous Waste No. F006. Marquette petitionedto exclude its waste based on the claim that the constituents of concernare not present in appreciable amounts in the petitioned waste. To supportits claim that both the non-listed and listed constituents of concern arenot present in the wastewater treatment sludge above levels of concern,Marquette submitted (1) detailed descriptions of its manufacturing andwaste treatment processes and wastewater treatment system; (2) a list ofraw materials used at the facility; (3) results from total constituentsanalyses for the EP toxic metals, nickel, and cyanide; (4) results fromEP leachate analyses for the EP toxic metals and nickel; (5) results fromleachate analyses for cyanide using distilled water; and (6) results fromtotal oil and grease analyses. These analyses were performed on representativesamples of Marquette's wastewater treatment sludge.The Agency evaluated the information and analytical data provided by Marquettein support of its petition and determined that the hazardous constituentsfound in the petitioned waste would not pose a threat to human health andthe environment. Specifically, the Agency used its Vertical and HorizontalSpread (VHS) model and Organic Leachate Model (OLM) to predict the potentialmobility of the hazardous constituents found in the petitioned waste. Basedon this evaluation, the Agency determined that the constituents in Marquette'swaste would not leach and migrate at concentrations above the health-basedlevels used in delisting decision-making. See 53 FR 45106, November 8,1988, for a more detailed explanation of why EPA proposed to grant Marquette'spetition for its wastewater treatment sludge.2. Agency Response to Public CommentsThe Agency received public comments on the proposed rule from two interestedparties. One commenter opposed the Agency's proposed decision to excludeMarquette's wastewater treatment sludge. The second commenter neither supportednor opposed the Agency's proposed decision, but claimed that the Agency``dismisses or at least discounts the idea of excluding'' F006 sludgessimilar to Marquette's that are generated by the job shop metal finishingindustry. The comments made by the two interested parties are discussedbelow.<ITAG tagnum="81">Petition-Specific Comments</ITAG>One commenter opposed the Agency's proposal to grant Marquette's petitionfor three reasons, two of which are discussed in turn below. The thirdreason concerns the inconsistencies between the Delisting Program and theLand Disposal Restrictions Program and is discussed in a later section.The commenter stated that the Agency did not consider other relevant potentialmismanagement scenarios during the evaluation of Marquette's petition.The commenter believes that airborne and waterborne dispersal of the wastecould occur, along with or in addition to those exposure routes associatedwith waste disposal (<T3>e.g.,</T3> ground-water contamination). With regard to possible airborne dispersal, the Agency notes that Marquette'streated waste is 70-80 percent water. Therefore, the Agency believes thatdue to the high water content of the waste, airborne dispersal of the treatedwaste is unlikely. With regard to waterborne dispersal of the waste, exposure could resultprimarily from surface waters receiving contaminated ground water or runoff,or from the consumption of drinking water (<T3>i.e., </T3>ground water) contaminated with leachate derived from thetreated material. The VHS model analysis described in the proposal showsthat leachate from the waste that travels through the ground water willnot exceed health-based levels used in delisting decision-making.The Agency acknowledges that it may be possible for surface water runoffto transport contaminants from the waste to a nearby surface water body.However, the Agency does not believe that analysis of such overland transportof contaminants would compel a different result for this petition. First,as described in the proposed rule, landfill disposal is a reasonable worst-casemanagement scenario for Marquette's filter cake wastes. Contamination ofsurface water might occur, therefore, through runoff from the petitionedwaste. However, EPA believes that the concentrations of any hazardous constituentsin that runoff will tend to be lower than the levels in the EP leachateanalyses reported in the proposal due to the acidic medium of the EP tests.Furthermore, any transported contaminants would be further diluted in thesurface water body.Secondly, the Agency believes, in general, that the leachate derived fromthis waste is not likely to directly enter a surface water body withoutfirst traveling through the saturated (subsurface) zone, where dilutionand attenuation of constituents may occur. The VHS model takes this saturatedzone into account as it predicts the ultimate fate and transport of hazardousconstituents. As a result, the Agency continues to believe that under reasonableworst-case conditions, the disposal of Marquette's waste will not presenta threat to either human health or the environment.The commenter also believed that the Agency should not have relied uponEP toxicity data for lead which merely indicated leachable lead levelsbelow a detection limit of 0.10 ppm. The commenter's concerns were basedprimarily on the fact that the health-based level for lead is 0.05 ppm.The Agency believes that Marquette may have been able to achieve a lowerdetection limit for its leachable lead analyses, if they had been requestedto do so. However, the Agency did not request additional quantificationof leachable lead levels because even an assumed maximum leachable leadlevel of 0.10 ppm passes the VHS model evaluation by a wide margin. Thus,the Agency maintains that leachable lead levels in Marquette's waste arenot of concern.The commenter further stated that the total metal content of the wastewatertreatment sludge is relevant in estimating the potential hazards of thepetitioned waste.The Agency agrees that the presence of significant total constituent concentrationsof the inorganic constituents of concern was one of the reasons for listingF006 wastes as ``T'' (toxic) wastes. See 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3)(ii) and ``BackgroundDocument, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle C, HazardousWaste Management, section 3001, Identification and Listing of HazardousWaste_Electroplating and Metal Finishing Operations,'' 1980. The Agency,however, believes that data presented in the Background Document characterizethe physical/chemical nature of a wide variety of F006 sludges and thatthese data are not representative of the physical/chemical nature of thetreated wastes produced by Marquette. Specifically, EPA believes it isreasonable to expect that, as the total constituent concentration of anunbound or loosely bound metal present in a waste increases, the potentialfor the metal to leach from the waste also increases (generally, the higherthe total constituent concentration of an unbound or loosely bound metal,the higher the potential EP leachate concentration). Thus, wastes havingsignificant total constituent concentrations of unbound or loosely boundmetals are more likely to impact the underlying ground water than wasteshaving lower total constituent concentrations of unbound or loosely boundmetals. In this case, however, the metals in Marquette's waste are tightlybound within the waste's matrix, as evidenced by the EP leachate analyses.Thus, the Agency believes that the elevated levels of the metals presentin Marquette's waste should not pose a threat to human health or the environment.The Agency's conclusion that the inorganic constituents of concern (includinglead) are bound in the waste matrix and thus are not available for leachingis supported by the results of the EP leachate analyses presented in theproposed notice. See 53 FR 45109, November 8, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="81">Exclusion of Job Shop Wastes</ITAG>A second commenter believes that the Agency discourages job shop facilitiesfrom pursuing delisting petitions. The commenter further claims that theAgency believes job shops cannot make a showing that petitioned wastesare consistent from month-to-month and year-to-year. The Agency maintainsthat, under 40 CFR 260.20 and 260.22, any facility may submit a petitionto exclude a waste, provided that the facility can demonstrate that thepetitioned waste (1) does not meet any of the criteria for which the wastewas listed, and (2) does not contain significant levels of any other hazardousconstituents. The Agency does not automatically disregard petitions submittedby job shop facilities. However, the Agency believes that constituent concentrationsin wastes generated by job shop facilities may be more variable than inwastes generated by captive electroplaters (facilities that plate theirown items). The Agency recognizes that the composition of certain typesof wastes may vary, yet this variation may be such that constituent levelsare still below levels of concern. In these cases, the Agency believesthat an exclusion may be merited. Depending on the variability of the waste,however, EPA may require these facilities to continually analyze the excludedwaste for a specific list of analytical parameters. Thus, the Agency isnot intentionally discouraging job shop facilities from submitting delistingpetitions, but is indicating that the information required of job shopfacilities may be more detailed than for those facilities that plate theirown products.<ITAG tagnum="81">Inconsistencies Between the Delisting Program and the Land DisposalRestrictions Program</ITAG>One commenter stated that there are inconsistencies between delisting levelsproposed for Marquette and the Land Disposal Restrictions Program's (LDRP)proposed best demonstrated available technology (BDAT) treatment levelsfor F006 wastes. See 53 FR 45106, November 8, 1988, and 53 FR 17578, May17, 1988, respectively. (On August 17, 1988, the Agency promulgated BDATtreatment levels for F006 non-wastewater wastes. See 53 FR 31138.) Specifically,the commenter stated that leachable concentrations of nickel would almostcertainly exceed the BDAT treatment standard promulgated for F006 wastes.The commenter indicated (and the Agency recognizes) that the DelistingProgram currently relies on results from the standard or Oily Waste EPleachate procedure (SW-846 Methods 1310 and 1330, respectively), whereas,the BDAT treatment standard for leachable nickel is based on TCLP levels.Furthermore, the commenter stated that it makes no sense for EPA to allowa waste that could not be legally disposed of at a Subtitle C site_becauseit exceeds promulgated BDAT levels_to be managed as a non-hazardous waste.The Agency agrees with the commenter that there are differences in approachbetween some of the decision criteria used in individual delisting decisionsand those used in the Land Disposal Restriction Program. However, thesedifferences are appropriate given the separate functions of the two programsand their different regulatory coverage. The Delisting Program and theLDRP are fundamentally different in that the Delisting Program's standardsare health-based and the LDRP's treatment standards are technology-based.See RCRA section 3001 (42 U.S.C. 6921) and RCRA section 3004 (42 U.S.C.6924(m)), respectively. The Agency, however, believes that both the health-basedand technology-based approaches of the Delisting Program and the LDRP,respectively, are protective of human health and the environment.3. <T3>Final Agency Decision</T3>For the reasons stated in the proposal, the Agency believes that Marquette'swastewater treatment sludge should be excluded from hazardous waste control.The Agency, therefore, is granting a final exclusion to Marquette Electronics,Incorporated, located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for its wastewater treatmentsludge described in its petition as EPA Hazardous Waste No. F006. The exclusiononly applies to the processes covered by the original demonstration. Thefacility would require a new exclusion if either its manufacturing or treatmentprocesses are significantly altered, such that an adverse change in wastecomposition occurred. Accordingly, the facility would need to file a newpetition for the altered waste. The facility must treat waste generatedfrom changed processes as hazardous until a new exclusion is granted.Although management of the waste covered by this petition is relieved fromSubtitle C jurisdiction, the generator of a delisted waste must eithertreat, store, or dispose of the waste in an on-site facility, or ensurethat the waste is delivered to an off-site storage, treatment, or disposalfacility, either of which is permitted, licensed, or registered by a Stateto manage municipal or industrial solid waste. Alternatively, the delistedwaste may be delivered to a facility that beneficially uses or resuses,or legitimately recycles or reclaims the waste, or treats the waste priorto such beneficial use, reuse, recycling, or reclamation.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Limited Effect of Final Exclusion</ITAG>The final exclusion being granted today is being issued under the Federal(RCRA) delisting program. States, however, are allowed to impose theirown, non-RCRA regulatory requirements that are more stringent than EPA's,pursuant to section 3009 of RCRA. These more stringent requirements mayinclude a provision which prohibits a Federally-issued exclusion from takingeffect in the State. Because a petitioner's waste may be regulated undera dual system (<T3>i.e.</T3>, goth Federal (RCRA) and State (non-RCRA) programs), petitionersare urged to contact their State regulatory authhority to determine thecurrent status of their wastes under the State law.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Effective Date</ITAG>This rule is effective immediately. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendmentsof 1984 amended section 3010 of RCRA to allow rules to become effectivein less than six months when the regulated community does not need thesix-month period to come into compliance. That is the case here becausethis rule reduces, rather than increases, the existing requirements forpersons generating hazardous wastes. In light of the unnecessary hardshipand expense that would be imposed on this petitioner by an effective datesix months after promulgation and the fact that a six-month deadline isnot necessary to achieve the purpose of Section 3010, EPA believes thatthis rule should be effective immediately. These reasons also provide abasis for making this rule effective immediately, upon promulgation, underthe Administrative Procedures Act, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d).<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Impact</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therfore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This rule to grant an exclusion is not major since its effect is to reducethe overall costs and economic impact of EPA's hazardous waste managementregulations. This reduction is achieved by excluding waste generated ata specific facility from EPA's lists of hazardous wastes, thereby enablingthe facility to treat its waste as non-hazardous. There is no additionaleconomic impact, therefore, due to today's rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, wheneveran agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for anyproposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public commenta regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the ruleon small entities (<T3>i.e.,</T3> small businesses, small organizations, and small governmentaljurisdictions). The Administrator or delegated representative may certify,however, that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities.This amendment will not have an adverse economic impact on small entitiessince its effect will be to reduce the overall costs of EPA's hazardouswaste regulations and is limited to one facility. Accordingly, I herebycertify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. This regulation, therefore,does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>Information collection and recordkeeping requirements associated with thisfinal rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511,44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and have been assigned OMB Control Number 2050-0053.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 261</ITAG>Hazardous materials, Waste treatment and disposal, Recycling.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: April 10, 1989</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jeffery D.
