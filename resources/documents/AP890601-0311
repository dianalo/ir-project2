There, they asked the 84-year-old Americancraftsman to replace all 110 pieces of his work that had beendestroyed.   ``We might even come up with something better,'' said Nakashima,one of the leading figures in American design and a pioneer amongcontemporary furniture makers.   Two pieces were spared destruction when a plumber's torch setoff the fire. Both were on loan to the American Craft Museum in NewYork City for an exhibition of Nakashima's work since 1945. Theexhibit runs through Aug. 13.   The Krosnicks' collection of Nakashima furniture spans 30 years,and their house had been designed to accommodate it. They trackeddown the blueprints and vow to rebuild.   Devotion to Nakashima is a trait the Krosnicks share with alarge group of admirers that includes Happy Rockefeller, whoseTarrytown N.Y. home has 220 examples of Nakashima's furniture.   ``We recognize George Nakashima as a national treasure. I thinkwe have become better people because of his influence,'' saysEvelyn Krosnick.   Even those who don't own his furniture may have felt hisinfluence, according to Derek E. Ostergard, curator of theexhibition and author of the book, ``George Nakashima: FullCircle'' (Weidenfeld andamp; Nicolson, $40).   Nakashima influenced a generation of young college-educatedAmericans to work with their hands.   His deceptively simple furniture combines magnificent wood, anoil finish that emphasizes the wood grain, fine workmanship and amix of contemporary and traditional forms.   ``These things are so powerful, so sensual, people can hardlykeep from touching them,'' says Ostergard. ``I don't know of worklike this elsewhere.''   No two pieces are alike, yet many _ especially the tables _feature a free-form edge which Ostergard defines as the outerprofile of a tree trunk just beneath the bark.   Nakashima, an American of Japanese descent who was interned inan Idaho relocation camp in 1942-43, has written extensively abouthow important his Japanese roots are to him.   Born in Spokane, Wash., and educated at Massachusetts Instituteof Technology, he worked as an architect in Japan before learningfurniture-making from a Japanese woodworker.   Yet, Ostergard says Nakashima's design philosophy is inspired bythe arts and crafts movement, a western invention, and hisfurniture is based on European joinery and forms such as theWindsor chair. Most Japanese furniture is built in and lacquered.Nakashima, who does not make built-ins, nearly always works withgrained wood.   During his internment, Nakashima teamed up with aJapanese-trained carpenter. ``I learned a great deal from him,'' hesays.   After the war, Nakashima set up shop in New Hope and collectorsbegan beating a path to his door. Today, the shop is open only afew hours on Saturday afternoons. Browsers may find a small stoolor side table for $200 or so. But most work is made to order and alarge dining table, for example, might cost $20,000.   The Krosnicks discovered his work there in the 1950s. Theyascribe to his belief that the best way to acquire furniture is``to buy something wonderful and keep it for your whole life andthen pass it on to your children. We feel permanence that way.''   Nakashima's workshop, with 10 employees, is actually a smallfactory with an annual output of as many as 1,000 pieces. It tookless than two years to produce the 220 items for the Rockefellerhouse.   Helping Nakashima run the company are his daughter, MirraNakashima-Yarnall, an architect and second in command; his wife,Marion, and son, Kevin.   Nakashima's pieces are made of solid wood, not veneer. Heregrets having to fell fine trees; even the title of his book is``The Soul of a Tree.'' But, says he, ``If we don't get it, someoneelse will. We feel we can give the tree a second life.''</TEXT></DOC>
