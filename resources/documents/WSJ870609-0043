Meanwhile, the industry has entered its annual frost-prone period, when traders ruminate about what Patagonia's weather will mean for the coffee-growing areas in southern Brazil. Cold-weather forecasts make the market nervous; a lack of them leaves the market drifting quietly, particularly this year when supplies are ample and buyers don't want to load up on coffee.    Activity in both futures and cash markets is at a low ebb, with prices showing only minor movements in the absence of major developments. On the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange in New York yesterday, coffee for July delivery settled at $1.1191 a pound, for a modest gain of 1.80 cents.    Analysts and trade officials attributed the advance to some buying back of contracts by dealers who recently sold the market short, betting on a price decline.    &quot;With prices slipping to the $1.10 level on Friday,&quot; a New York green-coffee dealer said, there was &quot;some demand&quot; by the firms, which &quot;also were interested in buying coffee in modest amounts to cover commitments they've made to roasters.&quot;    Meanwhile, according to Sandra Kaul, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York, &quot;Mild weather is prevailing in Brazilian coffee-growing areas, and that country is facing the prospect of a record 35 million-bag crop, 2 1/2 times last year's.&quot;    So supply considerations continue to depress prices, particularly now when roaster demand is at its seasonal summer low, Ms. Kaul said.    Coffee prices rose in May amid concern that Brazil would institute more-restrictive export policies, then the concern evaporated, Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said in a recent report. For a time, the report noted, it was thought that heavy export sales in the first half of the year might severely deplete Brazilian stocks, leading Brazil to tighten exports.    &quot;These concerns proved unfounded, however; not only did Brazil register more than 2.5 million bags for June shipment, an unusually large volume for one month's span, but trade sources in Brazil estimated that only 750,000 of these bags had been committed to an actual buyer, suggesting that heavy supplies would continue to overhang the market,&quot; according to the report.    As a result, Pru-Bache said, the industry started selling again and prices fell.    &quot;The market's decline was aggravated by continued reports that the 1987-88 crop, which is currently being harvested, was likely to yield between 31 million and 36 million bags of coffee,&quot; according to the report.    Coffee prices, Ms. Kaul says, &quot;tend to hit seasonal lows during the June-August period if weather problems don't emerge.&quot;    However, &quot;if they do, the market quickly can turn volatile,&quot; she said.    In other futures markets yesterday:    COPPER: Futures prices turned higher amid continued tightness in supplies for near-term delivery. The July contract at the Commodity Exchange in New York rose 0.60 cent a pound to 69.65 cents. At one point the contract stood at 70.50 cents before late selling trimmed the rally. A weaker dollar and further declines in exchange warehouse inventories in London and New York prompted the buying, an analyst said. Another supporting factor was Noranda Inc.'s announcement that because of currently low copper prices it won't resume operations at its Murdochville, Quebec, mine, which was damaged by fire early in the year. Copper inventories in London Metal Exchange warehouses fell 2,650 metric tons Friday to 107,250 tons -- their lowest level since June 1985. Comex inventories fell just 25 U.S. short tons from to 69,258 tons. However, at the end of February Comex stockpiles stood at 109,044 tons. A metric ton is equal to 1.1 short tons, or 2,204.6 pounds.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Forecasts of rain this week sent soybean futures prices lower. Low export figures also weighed against the bean markets. Meanwhile, wheat prices were pressed by the harvest, as clear and dry weekend weather allowed farmers to gather the winter wheat crop. Chicago-based grain analyst Conrad Leslie is predicting that the winter wheat harvest will yield 1.6 billion bushels. Corn prices were also lower.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle futures prices were mixed, and the August and October contracts were lower as traders prepared for an Agriculture Department cattle-on-feed report set for release after Monday's close. Analysts are saying the report on seven major beef-producing states will be bearish for the two contracts. According to estimates, the report should show that as of June 1 the herd population was up 3% to 4%, compared with a year earlier, and the number of animals placed on feedlots was up 4%. Marketing of animals to slaughter is expected to be down 6% to 8%. If the feedlot estimate proves valid, it will be the fifth consecutive month that feedlot placements have outdistanced year-earlier figures, says Charles Levitt, a Shearson Lehman analyst in Chicago. Pork futures closed lower, and hog prices were mixed amid some profit-taking following last week's gains. &quot;Some hog and belly traders saw cattle stub its toe, got nervous and decided to cash in their chips,&quot; says Mr. Levitt.    FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Futures prices closed higher in light, cautious trading as the market continued to watch for news from the economic summit in Venice. The dollar opened weaker amid reports that U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker repeated that he didn't expect the summit to produce any new initiative on the dollar. &quot;The market took it disparagingly,&quot; said Dennis Gartman, president of Gartman Financial Services Inc. in Portsmouth, Va. &quot;More happened than should have early, and, by the end of the day, prices were where they should have been,&quot; Mr. Gartman said. The dollar gained some strength in intra-day trading from news that President Reagan decided to lift part of the trade sanctions against Japan. It also was supported, an analyst said, by reports that White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker said he expected significant news from the summit. </TEXT></DOC>
