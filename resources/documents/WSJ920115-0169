Most oil prices declined in choppy trading yesterday eventhough Libya became the second member of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries to announce a token output cut.</LP><TEXT>   Hit by an afternoon sell-off, U.S. crude-oil futures weresharply lower. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oilfor February delivery was down 32 cents to settle at $18.47 abarrel. March crude fell 29 cents to $18.61 a barrel.   Before the market was overwhelmed by a renewal of thebearish sentiment that has swept world oil markets in thepast several weeks, the Libyan news did firm up pricesbriefly. The announcement came from the Libyan oil ministerduring an official visit to Caracas, Venezuela. He toldreporters there that Libya will reduce production by 20,000to 30,000 barrels a day this week and will demand that itspartners in OPEC agree on a total reduction of as much as twomillion barrels a day to prop up prices.   Libya produces about 1.5 million barrels a day. Venezuela,which was produceing nearly 2.4 million barrels a day, lastweek announced an immediate output reduction of 50,000barrels a day to send a &quot;signal&quot; to world oil markets and toothers in OPEC.   Yesterday, Ecuador's new energy minister also joined inthe calls for OPEC to cut production to trim the oversupplythat has driven oil prices down by as much as $5 a barrelsince October. Evidence is mounting that there will be aconsensus for OPEC-wide production cuts when the oilministers meet next on Feb. 12.   Still, the symbolic reductions so far are much too modestto put a floor under falling oil prices, analysts said. Theystill are waiting for some word from Saudi Arabia, whichaccounts for more than one-third of OPEC's output of morethan 24 million barrels a day.   After futures trading ended yesterday, the AmericanPetroleum Institute released its weekly report on U.S. oilstatistics. It showed that inventories of distillates, whichinclude heating oil, dropped as expected in the latest weekby nearly 1.3 million barrels. But inventories of crude oilincreased nearly 4.8 million barrels, and gasoline stocksgrew 2.9 million barrels.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Wheat prices continued to rally inthe wake of government reports that U.S. supplies will betight this year. Winter wheat farmers have planted feweracres than expected in the wake of poor U.S. harvests.Stockpiles are expected to shrink to their tightest levelsince the early 1970s. Wheat futures prices rose tolife-of-contract highs during yesterday's session at theChicago Board of Trade. The contract for July delivery jumpedeight cents a bushel to settle at $3.7125. Corn pricessettled mixed and soybean prices fell. Traders are watchingfor whether the former Soviet republics will pay back theshort-term U.S. grain-buying loans that begin to come dueFriday. Traders are speculating that Russia is primarilyresponsible for repaying the food loans, which are guaranteedby the U.S. government. So far, the U.S. has arranged morethan $3 billion in loan guarantees. Traders are speculatingthat if the former republics fall behind on loan payments,the White House won't offer more guarantees.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices fell. Sugar for March delivery endedat 8.3 cents a pound, down 0.14 cent. Judith Ganes, senioranalyst at Merrill Lynch, attributed the decline to a growingsense among traders that recent deals between Cuba and theformer Soviet republics to swap sugar for oil are unraveling.Several million tons of sugar were believed to be at stakebut it now appears the republics could be takingsubstantially less than expected this year, she said. Inaddition, a food-aid plan by the French government for theformer Soviet Union that had been in the works for severalmonths was rumored to have hit some stumbling blocks, Ms.Ganes said. The deal would have involved about 100,000 tonsof sugar. Although equipment, fuel and transportationproblems are expected to substantially reduce Cuba's sugarcrop, demand for the country's sugar could fall even morethan supply, leaving more Cuban sugar available to sell inthe world market, she said. Moreover, production by othercountries is expected to be higher this year, she added.Unless there's some sign of improvement in demand, pricescould test old contract lows in the next couple of weeks, shepredicted.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices ended mostly lower. Copper forMarch delivery finished at 94.7 cents a pound, down 0.1 cent.Steady buying from Asian consumers has some analysts thinkingprices are near a bottom. &quot;The market is beginning to showsome signs of life,&quot; said Mike Frawley, metals trader at DeanWitter in New York. But the economy and the copper demandpicture in the U.S. are still bleak, said William O'Neill,senior futures strategist at Merrill Lynch. The emergence ofconsumer demand could mean copper is in a transition phase,in which prices will move in a tight range for a while andperhaps begin rising modestly after the first quarter, hesaid. Fred Demler, metals economist at PaineWebber, saideconomic growth prospects aren't encouraging for copper:Japanese import requirements for 1992 are expected to beabout 10% below last year's, and the outlook for the U.S.economy is uncertain at best. However, the possibility of anelection-year economic stimulus from Washington and theaggressive lowering of interest rates by the Federal Reserveindicate improved prospects for copper later in the year, hesaid. Copper looks weak for the short term, he added. Theprice's drop below 94 cents on Monday signals a test of the90-cent level within a month, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
