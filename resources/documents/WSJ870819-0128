But there are several differences. First, the prime minister is Giovanni Goria, a Christian Democrat, and the government had not been led by the Christian Democrats, known as the DC, in six years, with the exception of the two caretaker governments headed for a few months by Amintore Fanfani in 1983 and again before the last election.    Second and more important, though the majority is the same, this government is not supposed to be referred to as a &quot;pentapartito.&quot; This is one of those Italian paradoxes that are so difficult to understand. The explanation given by the participants in the game runs as follows: The present government, even though formed by the five partners of the previous coalition, is not based on a clear &quot;political majority&quot; but on a &quot;convergence on the program.&quot; Such an explanation is unintelligible. What is a political majority if not an agreement to implement a given program? What is the meaning of an agreement on a program if not that of the formation of a political majority? No, the riddle is unexplainable -- unless one tries to go beyond what politicians say.    The probable explanation of the paradox, according to most observers, is that Bettino Craxi, the leader of the Italian Socialist Party, known as PSI, wants to keep his options open and is unwilling, after four years as premier, to commit himself to a coalition led by a Christian Democrat. For even though the Socialists gained votes in the last election, they received less than half the votes of the Christian Democrats. There is no reason, therefore, why the prime minister should not come from the DC, which is still the largest party in Parliament. So Mr. Craxi has agreed to support a government headed by the DC, but only on a temporary basis, with no commitment regarding the future.    Mr. Craxi's long-range political plan seems aimed at gaining votes at the expense of the Communist Party, known as the PCI, until the Socialists become the largest party of the left. At that point, Mr. Craxi's party would be able to choose between leading a coalition of the left or making an alliance with the DC, and its bargaining power would become enormous. The risk in this kind of game is that the DC might get tired of it and react accordingly. Today, the DC needs the support of Mr. Craxi's party if it wants to form a government excluding the Communists. Since anti-communism is the DC's greatest (or only) asset, it is naturally unwilling to form an alliance with the Communists.    This, however, does not mean that the DC is going to put up with anything Mr. Craxi decides to inflict on it. The temptation to dump Mr. Craxi's party and resort to an alliance with the Communists is enhanced by the fact that the Communists are so afraid of having entered an irreversible decline that they would accept any condition to re-enter the political game. An alliance between the DC and the Communists looks less absurd if one remembers that in the late 1970s the &quot;historic compromise&quot; -- as the coalition between Roman Catholics and Communists was then called -- almost materialized. These byzantine intricacies explain why Italians put up with the unintelligible distinction between a &quot;political majority&quot; and &quot;convergence on the program.&quot;    What is at stake is the same old problem: Will Italy succeed in keeping the Communists out of government? That this is the key question can easily be understood by looking at the poll results. These unequivocally show that no matter how inefficient, unstable or corrupt the coalition governments formed under the Christian Democratic leadership, the vast majority of Italian electors would rather be governed by them than allow the Communists into the government. This explains why the same party has been in power for more than 40 years, despite its record of inefficiency and dishonesty. No other democratic party in the Western world can claim such a long period of success. It also explains why even though &quot;governments&quot; change every 10 months on average, they are always made by the same political parties: Nothing is more stable than Italy's &quot;unstable-stability.&quot;    Mr. Goria's government doesn't seem destined to last long, but it would be premature to predict its early demise. After all, almost all governments of the past decade looked weak at the moment of their formation. Most of them proved to be weak, and that's the way to bet even in this case. On the other hand, since there are no apparent alternatives, it might well be that this government will succeed in lasting for, let us say, several months or even a couple of years. The situation will then be back to where it started, and the whole game will begin all over again. Maybe the time is ripe for some kind of electoral reform aimed at increasing the stability of the executive. However, considering the fragmentation of Parliament, it is unlikely that an agreement can be reached on such a controversial issue. &quot;Stable-instability,&quot; therefore, might be inevitable.    However, there is something worrisome about Mr. Goria's government, and that is its probable economic policy. Mr. Goria himself, as minister of the treasury in Mr. Craxi's government, earned a reputation as a big spender. In the past four years, under Mr. Goria's management, public-sector spending has increased 71% in nominal terms, more than 33% after adjustment for inflation, and it has increased its ratio to gross domestic product by 21%, absorbing an additional 9% of national income. That's no small achievement in just four years.    In his speech to the senate, Mr. Goria has promised, like all prime ministers before him, to control public spending. His sincerity, however, is doubtful. After the &quot;taxpayers march&quot; of November 1986, Mr. Goria's comment was: &quot;We enjoy the freedom of marching in this country, but the state needs more money, not less.&quot; This was an ill-advised comment, probably one that he would prefer not to have made. It is, however, unfortunately consistent with the dismal record of his management of public expenditures.    As for tax reform, the appointment of Antonio Gava as minister of finance is not a good omen. The complexity of the Italian tax mess would require someone exceptionally qualified to grasp it, let alone reform it. Mr. Gava, an influential member of the DC, has no particular competence in the field and does not seem inclined to radical reform. The appointment of Giuliano Amato, an able socialist politician and jurist, as minister of the treasury, makes it doubtful that spending control will register any success. Mr. Amato's political views are akin to that of an old-fashioned big-spending American liberal, and he has no formal training in economics. It looks as if this government's economic policy therefore will continue in the direction of increased spending, taxation and borrowing. Still, it's probably prudent to wait and see. After all, as the saying goes, &quot;he who foresees calamities suffers them twice over.&quot;    ---   Mr. Martino is professor of monetary history and policy at the University of Rome. </TEXT></DOC>
