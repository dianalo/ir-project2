 As source material for scannedimages, transparencies have two main advantages over prints.andP;  First, they areinherently capable of a much wider range of brightness, contrast, and colorsaturation than are reflective materials such as color prints.andP;  Second,slides are easier to handle, store, and transport than prints are.andP;  Takentogether, these two factors have made slide scanners the device of choice forthose brave souls who perform desktop color separations.andM;We tested three slide scanners: the Barneyscan CIS-3515, Howtek Scanmaster35/II, and Nikon LS3500.andP;  We also looked at prerelease versions of the ArrayTechnologies AS-I and Barneyscan CIS-4520 scanners (see the &quot;On the Horizon&quot;sidebar).andP;  Although all the scanners produce full-color 24-bit images from35mm transparencies, we found differences in ease of setup and use, inimage-processing and colorcollection capabilities, in scanning speed, and inmaximum resolution.andP;  After extensive testing, we recommend the Barneyscan andNikon scanners, depending on which features you consider most important.andO;Setting UpandM;All the scanners require a Mac II with a vacant NuBus slot and at least 4megabytes of RAM.andP;  A 24-bit video card, although not required for scanning,is almost essential for doing any manipulation of color images the scanners'software produce an 8bit dithered image for display on 8bit-color monitors,but adjustments to the color quickly turn these dithered images into garbage.andM;The Barneyscan CIS-3515 is the easiest of the scanners to set up, since ituses a proprietary NuBus board that requires no configuring.andP;  After you cablethe board to the scanner and place an INIT (which installs the scannerdrivers each time you start your Mac) in the System Folder, the CIS-3515 isready to calibrate.andM;The Nikon and Howtek scanners, on the other hand, both use a GPIB(general-purpose interface bus) NuBus board (which can have several GPIBdevices daisy-chained to it).andP;  Unfortunately, the application that configuresthe GPIB INIT for both scanners, charmingly named ibconf, borders on theuser-hostile.andM;In the case of the Howtek scanner, the INIT was configured for an earliermodel of that company's scanner, and the error message &quot;sp scan todisk():create() of temp file failed;; os check: os ERR error code of -48;;&quot;offered by ibconf was no help.andP;  The manual did not cover the topicadequately, and it took considerable experimentation to get the INITconfigured properly.andM;The Nikon scanner came with a correctly set up INIT and a manual with clearinstructions for configuring the INIT, just in case.andP;  All that was requiredwas to install the GPIB board, plug in the scanner, and place the INIT in theSystem Folder.andM;Next, you need to calibrate the scanner.andP;  All three scanners use a linear CCD(charge-coupled device) array to record the light that passes through thetransparency.andP;  The calibration process establishes values for absolute blackand absolute white and compensates for minute variations in the lighting andin the response of each element in the CCD array.andM;Barneyscan recommends recalibrating its scanner weekly or each time you moveit.andP;  The process, which takes about 15 minutes, uses a special calibrationslide (supplied) and, once started, requires no user intervention.andP;  Unlikewith the other scanners, you also need to focus the CIS-3515.andP;  The Focuscommand presents an onscreen numeric display that changes as you adjust thefocus wheel on the scanner.andP;  The image is in focus when the highest number isdisplayed.andP;  We found this more difficult to use than the auto-focus of theother scanners, and it didn't really seem to increase sharpness.andM;The Nikon scanner is selfcalibrating and is ready to use as soon as it'sconnected to the GPIB board.andP;  Instead of using absolute values for black andwhite, it automatically Figure 1: To test the quality of scanned colors, weused a Kodak Ektachrome 060 Color Target transparency and a photograph.andP;  TheBarneyscan CIS-3515 and Nikon LS-3500 yielded color of a wider range andbetter quality than did the Howtek Scanmaster 35/11.andP;  performs a routinecalled prescan sensitometry during the first scan of each session and uses itto match the range of tonal values in the slide being scanned.andP;  Normally,this needs to be done only once, but if a slide is very different in tonalvalues from others scanned in the same session, you can choose PrescanSensitometry from a menu.andP;  Prescan sensitometry takes about ten seconds,depending on the contents of the slide.andM;Calibration of the Howtek for black and white values must be done each timethe scanner is turned on.andP;  The process is quite simple and takes about twominutes.andP;  During calibration, however, the Scanmaster 35/11 makes a soundlike someone drilling through a cinder block.andP;  The Howtek scanner is quitenoisy in general, but the sound made during calibration is the most extremein its repertoire.andM;Previewing the ScanandM;All three scanners allow you to perform a quick low-resolution preview scanthat you can use as a basis for adjusting exposure controls, cropping theimage, and doing gamma correction (adjusting the midtone levels in an imagewithout changing the highlights and shadows).andP;  You can also use automaticexposure and gamma settings on each scanner.andM;The BarneyscanXP software does the fastest preview scan, taking about 35seconds to produce a gray-scale preview image with 256 shades of gray - itdoesn't do a color preview image.andP;  You can use this image to set exposure,gamma-correction levels, and image cropping and scaling for the final scan.andO;The effects of your adjustments are displayed interactively in the previewimage.andM;Howtek's MacScan-It application provides a color preview image in 1 minute 45seconds.andP;  Exposure and gamma adjustments aren't interactive - you must doanother prescan to see the effects.andP;  Cropping involves moving and resizing atransparent preview window that floats in front of the image rather thanusing a normal selection marquee - we found this quite clumsy.andP;  The Howteksoftware also lets you set the output resolution for the scan.andO;Unfortunately, each time you choose preview, the output resolution defaultsto that of the postage-stamp-sized preview image, so you must remember toreset the output resolution after performing the preview scan.andM;Nikon's Colorflex software has the most complete set of prescan adjustmentsand also gives the highestresolution prescan image - 768 x 512 pixels.andO;(Because slide scanners are designed to scan the complete area of a 35mmslide, resolution is usually given in pixels rather than in dots per inch.)andO;But the LS-3500 has the slowest prescanning time, at 2 minutes 52 seconds,and Colorflex's powerful controls can be somewhat bewildering to novices.andO;Fortunately, the Nikon LS-3500's automaticexposure mode generally givesexcellent results.andP;  The LS-3500 is the only scanner tested here that lets youchoose from a variety of input resolutions, which Nikon calls resolutionpitches, but the method for doing so isn't particularly intuitive.andP;  Pitchsettings range from I to 50.andP;  Resolution equals the maximum resolution of thescanner (6,144 x 4,096 pixels) divided by the pitch value.andP;  Thus the defaultsetting, 8 pitch, results in a 768-x-512-pixel image.andM;Scanning the SlideandM;Once you have the exposure settings, cropping frame, and scaling factor setto your satisfaction, the next step is to perform a full resolution scan andsave it to disk.andP;  The Barneyscan treats scanning and saving to disk as twoseparate operations, but it still had the fastest raw scanning speed of thethree scanners.andP;  Scanning our test image at 1,520 x 1,024 resolution took Iminute 40 seconds, and saving to disk took an additional 9 seconds.andM;The Howtek also treats scanning and saving as separate operations but is byfar the slowest of the three scanners.andP;  Scanning the image took a lengthy 9minutes 41 seconds, and saving the image to disk took a further 2 minutes 13seconds.andP;  Howtek's MacScan-It software commits the cardinal sin of failing towarn you if you quit the application with an unsaved image.andP;  It simply quits,and the image, which took so long to capture, is lost - unforgivable.andM;The Nikon scanner treats scanning to disk as a single operation.andP;  It also hasa somewhat unusual file-handling system.andP;  When you choose Scan to Disk,Colorflex asks you to name a folder that will contain the image files.andP;  Inaddition to saving the final image file, the Colorflex software saves thered, green, and blue channels of the image as separate TIFF files, so a scanrequires well over twice as much disk space as the actual image.andP;  To use themaximum 6,144-x-4,096-pixel resolution of the scanner, you need 145 megabytesfree on your hard disk !andP;  Our test image took 7 minutes 57 seconds for theLS-3500 to scan and save.andP;  The relatively slow speed is mitigated by twofeatures.andP;  First, you can set the input resolution of the Figure 2: Thesehistograms show the range of colors from a gray Wratten filter.andP;  in a perfecttest, all the pixels are the same color, appearing as a single vertical lineon the histogram.andP;  The Nikon LS-3500 gave the best result, with theBarneyscan CIS-3515 a very close second.andP;  The Howtek Scanmaster 35/11 sawmany different shades of gray, resulting in a histogram spread over severallevels.andP;  scanner, and a lower resolution makes for a faster scan - scanningthe test image at 768 x 512 reduced the scanand-save time to 3 minutes 35seconds.andP;  Second, you can save the scan in multiple formats simultaneously.andO;Colorflex uses the separate red, green, and blue TIFF files to produce finalimages, so you can save the image in any or all of Colorflex's supportedformats with a single command.andP;  Image QualityandM;The Barneyscan and the Nikon scanners both yield excellent color (see Figure1).andP;  The Howtek unit suffers from muddy and often inaccurate colors, with aparticular deficiency in the yellows, which look green.andP;  The CIS-3515 andLS-3500 were also capable of capturing a wider range of color than theScanmaster 35/11 was.andM;The Howtek scanner also performed noticeably poorly in our Wratten-filtertest (which measures the evenness of gray values in a scanned image), withthe test slide's single gray level smeared across five or six levels in thescan (see Figure 2).andP;  The Nikon scanner gave the best result in this test,with Barneyscan's a very close second - so close, in fact, that theCIS-3515's minor imperfections would probably have no effect in the scanningof real-world images.andM;We expected performance on our resolution test to be directly related to theoptical resolution of the scanner.andP;  As expected, the Nikon LS-3500, with aresolution of 6,144 x 4,096, outperformed its competitors handily.andP;  TheBarneyscan CIS-3515 (1,024 x 1,5 20) came in such a close third to the HowtekScanmaster 35/11 (3,000 x 2,000) that the difference was almost too close tocall.andP;  Obviously the quality of the optics has a considerable effect too.andO;SummaryandM;Overall, we judged the Barneyscan scanner to have the best software.andO;BarneyscanXP is a proprietary version of Adobe Photoshop (actually it'sPhotoshop's predecessor) and as such is worth a review unto itself Nikon'sColorflex software has some quirks, particularly in its nonstandard filehandling, but its powerful controls offer experienced users a greater degreeof control over the scanning process itself than do those of either of itscompetitors.andP;  It has no postprocessing capabilities, however.andP;  In fact,Colorflex is not even able to display the image after it has been scanned.andM;Howtek's MacScan-It application is clumsy and suffers from some notableomissions.andP;  In addition to lacking a warning regarding unsaved images, theprogram fails to provide any means of scanning a landscapeoriented slide inits true horizontal orientation.andP;  Instead, you must scan it in portraitorientation and then resort to third-party software to rotate it 90 degrees.andM;The Barneyscan CIS-3515 and Nikon LS-3500 can both produce professional colorscans for images up to 5 x 7 inches, but they lack the resolution that'srequired for producing full-page high-quality color images.andP;  In addition, thesheer size of high-resolution files taxes the Mac to its limits - a150-megabyte file is not unusual for a full-page image.andM;Soon-to-be-released midrange slide scanners (see the &quot;On the Horizon&quot;sidebar) will partially address the problem of insufficient resolution, butthey won't turn Mac users into color prepress pros overnight.andP;  Experts inworking with high-end color workstations know how to correct images for sucharcane problems as the dot gain in the output device, the quirks of aparticular printing press, different kinds of paper stock, and even inkimpurities.andP;  Color printing is still a complex field, and that isn't likelyto change in the very near future.andP;  Bruce Fraser is a San Francisco-basedfree-lance writer, desktop publisher, md self-confessed Crystal Quest addictwho remembers the days whom a 330-megabyte hard disk seemed huge.andM;The slide scanners we tested all cost less than $10,000, but publishingprofessionals interested in the high end of Macintosh 35mm scanning shouldtake a look at two new slide scanners in the $25,000 range.andP;  Both unitsshould be available by the time you read this.andM;The Array Technologies AS-1 scanner is a technological departure.andP;  Whereasthe scanners we tested use a linear CCD array to read the image one scan lineat a time, the AS-1 uses a 256-x-256-pixel Hitachi color-TV matrix sensor.andO;To increase resolution, the AS-1 moves the matrix subpixel distances andresamples the image.andP;  The AS-1 scanner is an integrating camera - that is, itcontinuously samples the image and then sums and averages the results.andP;  Thelonger the integration time the operator chooses, the better the colorfidelity that results - simple scans can be done in two minutes and very highresolution scans in two hours.andP;  Because the camera head is detachable f romthe unit that holds and illuminates the slide, options such as copy standsand tripods allow you to scan not only 35mm slides but also large-formattransparencies, printed material; and even 3-D objects.andP;  Array Technologies,inc., 7730 Pardee Lane, Oakland, CA 94621;(415) 6333000.andM;Barneyscan announced its new CIS-4520 just as we finished testing.andP;  TheGIS-4520 will feature a maximum 2,000-x-3,000-pixel resolution with12-bit-color accuracy and will handle transparencies up to 4 x 5 inches.andO;Bundled with the scanner will be Barneyscan's excellent new CIS-ColorAccesssoftware, a sophisticated package for producing color separations that willallow selective brightness controls and contrast controls for each color andadjustable gray-balance and tone-curve settings to compensate for differenttypes of press, ink, andandM;All three of the slide scanners we tested are capable of extracting moreinformation from a slide than can be successfully reproduced in print.andP;  Theydiffer, however, in scanning speed, resolution, and the amount of tweakingnecessary to produce a useful image.andM;The Nikon LS-3500 ($9,995) could use friendlier software, but it wins overallfor flexibility in resolution and for the wide range of controls it offers, from completely automatic operation through simple colorTV-type controls tovery sophisticated tweaking.andP;  Focusing and calibration are both automatic.andO;The LS-3500 has the highest resolution, at 6,144 x 4,096 pixels, and is theonly scanner to offer variable input resolution.andP;  The Nikon Colorflexsoftware lacks any postprocessing capabilities, but Nikon offers a freeplug-in driver that allows you to scan directly from the Adobe Photoshopapplication.andM;The Barneyscan CIS-3515 ($9,495) is a very close second to Nikon's LS-3500.andO;The CIS-3515 gives notably sharper images than Barneyscan's earlier slidescanner, the CIS-3510, and also has improved color accuracy.andP;  It is theeasiest slide scanner to set up and has the fastest scan time and the bestsoftware - it's the only scanner to offer postscanning image-manipulationtools.andP;  Although it has the lowest resolution of the three scanners, at 1,520x 1,024 pixels, the CIS-3515 provides images that are almost as sharp as theHowtek Scanmaster 35/11's, even though the Howtek has twice the resolution.andO;On the minus side, the manual focus leaves you wondering if the image isreally in focus, the image preview is in gray scale rather than in color, andthe unit requires regular calibration.andM;The Howtek Scanmaster 35/11 ($6,995) beats the other two in only one areaprice.andP;  Given its slow scan times, poor color fidelity, and unfriendlysoftware, we feel that the savings offered by the Scanmaster 35/II fail tocompensate for the unit's overall poor performance.andP;  You can get usableimages from the scanner but only after much tweaking with an application suchas Adobe Photoshop.andP;  Fortunately, Howtek makes a scanner driver for Photoshopavailable free to registered owners of the scanner.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
