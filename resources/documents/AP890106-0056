(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A 9-year-old girl threatened with evictionfrom an adult-only condominium since her mother died last year willbe allowed to remain at least two more months, the condo board hasruled.   Eviction proceedings were scheduled to begin against Jamie Swartzon Jan. 10, but the Viewpointe Condominium board ruled Thursday thegirl can stay while the ramifications of a new federal housing actare researched.   ``It must be similar to what someone on Death Row must feel,''said Jill Swartz, Jamie's stepmother. ``It's not over yet. It's justa reprieve until they find something else to throw at us.''   The Fair Housing Amendment Act, which takes effect March 12, bansage discrimination in housing with the exception of subsidizedfacilities for the elderly, or in complexes where all occupants are62 years old or above or if 80 percent of the units have oneresident at least 55 years old.   The board is not clear if the Viewpointe condos fulfill the ageexemptions, said Douglas Neway, attorney for the condo association.But the board has scheduled a meeting for Jan. 10 to vote on aproposal to require at least one resident at least 55 years old ineach unit.   Some residents of the condominium who oppose the adult-only ruledare seeking to cancel the meeting.   ``I think if they get the 55 or older thing through, they'll beright back on Jamie's case again,'' said Marcy Esposito.   In a prepared statement, Neway said the board decided that noaction would be taken on Jamie's case at least until the new lawgoes into effect.   Jamie moved into the complex with her father, Lynn, and herstepmother in April after her 42-year-old mother, Maye Swartz, washospitalized with cancer. The condo board voted in July to allowJamie to stay until her mother finished chemotherapy. Mrs. Swartzdied in September.   The board threatened to seek eviction in November, but it allowedthe girl to remain through the holidays provided the two-bedroomcondo was placed on the market.   The couple said there have been few buyers interested in thecondo, purchased three years ago for about $50,000.</TEXT></DOC>
