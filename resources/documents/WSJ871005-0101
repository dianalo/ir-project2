No justice has doubted that legal rights must be found in the Constitution; what I testified in the Senate was that no past or present justice &quot;has ever taken a view as consistently radical as Judge Bork's on the concept of 'liberty' -- or the lack of it -- underlying the Constitution.&quot; Even Justice Black, who came closest to insisting that only the liberties listed in the Bill of Rights are protected, rejected the position now espoused by Judge Bork that &quot;liberty&quot; is completely exhausted by that listing: Justice Black joined the opinion in Skinner v. Oklahoma, holding procreation to be a fundamental unenumerated liberty; he joined the opinion in Bolling v. Sharpe, extending Fifth Amendment &quot;liberty&quot; to encompass schoolchildren's right to an integrated education; and he joined the opinion in Loving v. Virginia, upholding that 14th Amendment &quot;liberty&quot; encompasses the unlisted right to choose a marriage partner.    Your editorial trivializes the debate by casting it as a dispute between Judge Bork and those who would ground rights in something other than the Constitution's text. The real dispute is between Judge Bork and those who read the word &quot;liberty&quot; as extending beyond the specific liberties that the Framers enumerated. My point is that, on this basic issue, Judge Bork is very much the odd-man-out. Indeed, Judge Bork can maintain his crabbed understanding of &quot;liberty&quot; only by dismissing the Ninth Amendment -- which states that &quot;the enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people&quot; -- as a mere &quot;inkblot&quot; on the Constitution. This, from a man who purports to be strictly faithful to that document's text.    Laurence H. Tribe   Tyler Professor of Constitutional Law    Harvard Law School   Cambridge, Mass.   ---   History should forever brand the Senate as our most intellectually dishonest institution and the greatest of all threats to our liberties if it withholds consent to the appointment of Robert Bork, a nominee of paramount honesty and qualification.    A primary purpose of our ancestors in establishing a government separate from England's aristocracy was to elevate the authority of the law to the highest plane in relation to both the personal whims of titleholders and the trivial grab bag of elective politics. The American public has demanded that the first loyalty of government officials be to the objective content of the law, lest we all become enslaved under a tyrant pretending to implement something &quot;better&quot; than the law. The current senatorial and interest-group opposition to Judge Bork rests solely on the fact that he has been absolutely honest in scrutinizing the legal validity of the awesome excercises of government power comprised by court decisions on constitutional issues.    It is laughable to suppose that Judge Bork endangers our liberty. His whole professional life has been committed to scrutinizing the intellectual honesty of court decisions, candidly laying his thoughts out for critique in the meticulous literature that law professors and judges study to be fully informed.    The responsibility for what the law says rests completely upon the Senate and the House of Representatives, and not on any judge. That is a fundamental reason why law is supreme over men in our remarkably stable constitutional system. For the Senate to begin making policy by ideological interrogation and selection of judicial nominees, rather than by writing and updating the law itself, would be far more than a cowardly fraud on the American public. It would be a repudiation of law and substitution of dictatorship far more profound than any one mere judge could possibly perpetrate.
