The initiative first ran into trouble when a Commerce Department draft proposal for a variety of government efforts to subsidize and give special treatment to the HDTV industry was soundly criticized by other agencies in May. A promised revision of the proposal still hasn't surfaced. In addition, an interagency working group on HDTV, a new generation of TV with unparalleled picture quality, hasn't met since the spring.    Then yesterday, a Commerce Department official told a congressional committee that the department's response to business and congressional HDTV proposals -- originally promised for July 1 and then delayed until September -- now has been put off until later in the year. The issue requires &quot;deeper evaluation and analysis,&quot; Juan Benitez, deputy assistant secretary for science and technology, told the Senate Government Affairs Committee.    The Commerce Department hasn't surrendered yet, however. Wayne Berman, counselor to Mr. Mosbacher, said yesterday that he plans to circulate a substantially revised proposal inside the administration before the end of this month. The proposal will be broader than the first, advocating policies aimed at a variety of technologies, including HDTV, he said. &quot;We've come to believe that HDTV is one piece of a puzzle in the range of technologies we need to be competitive in,&quot; he said.    These hitches aren't likely to affect the Pentagon's enthusiasm for funding research on HDTV technologies, particularly those relating to flat-panel displays. Craig Fields, director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, said yesterday that the agency will announce new HDTV-related awards within a few days. The agency has already allocated $30 million over three years for HDTV research.    Separately, a Congressional Budget Office study released yesterday concluded the HDTV market is likely to be too small to revitalize the U.S. electronics industry.    Testifying before the Senate committee, CBO Director Robert Reischauer expressed doubts about whether HDTV could be the kind of technology &quot;driver&quot; that its champions predict. He said that HDTV's impact on the U.S. semiconductor industry is likely to be marginal. The CBO study indicated that demand for TV sets with large, movie-quality pictures could be slowed by confusion over technical standards and the pace at which programming taking advantage of the technology becomes available.    Nevertheless, interest is keen in Congress. &quot;CBO's suggestion that America shouldn't develop HDTV -- with its implications for industry imaging, entertainment, education and computers -- is absurd,&quot; said Rep. Mel Levin (D., Calif.). Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio) warned, &quot;We need to pre-empt our foreign competitors.&quot;    Several lawmakers have introduced bills that would provide $100 million a year for HDTV research. In addition, the American Electronics Association is asking for $1.35 billion in federal grants, loans and guarantees from the Pentagon and other government agencies.    The Commerce Department initiative ran into trouble within the administration -- from the Office of Management and Budget, the Council of Economic Advisers, the Treasury and key White House staff, among others -- because it called for government equity investment in joint ventures, exceptions to government regulations exclusively for the HDTV industry and government-sponsored standards designed to aid U.S. producers without regard to the cost to consumers.    &quot;It did more than flirt delicately with industrial policy, despite all the {Bush} campaign rhetoric against industrial policy,&quot; one administration official said.    The cabinet-level Economic Policy Council -- to which any HDTV proposal would normally be sent -- isn't likely to approve any plan targeted at only one industry. &quot;The point has been driven home completely that any proposal must be generic, across-the-board and good for all business -- and not directed toward HDTV,&quot; another administration official said. </TEXT></DOC>
