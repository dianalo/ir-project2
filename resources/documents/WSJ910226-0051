But the rally in crude oil in cash and futures marketsappeared to be short-lived, and most of the price gains wereclipped before the day's trading ended.</LP><TEXT>   Then, after futures trading had closed, prices fell in thecash market on a Baghdad Radio report that Saddam Hussein hadordered Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. The spot price of WestTexas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, was around 25cents a barrel lower last night. Some traders said theyexpect similar declines in Europe and U.S. futures priceswhen trading opens today.   Earlier, the war jitters already had been overshadowedagain by the bearish bias that has ruled world oil markets inrecent weeks. Oil analysts and traders cited the fundamentalfactor of an indicated oversupply of crude oil.   &quot;There is still a lot of confusion on the long-termdirection of the markets, but traders are short-term beastsand short-term they see plenty of barrels around,&quot; said PeterGignoux, manager of the Shearson Lehman Brothersinternational energy desk in London.   Even so, on London's International Petroleum Exchange,Brent blend crude oil futures closed 17 cents to 35 cents abarrel higher than their levels at the end of Friday'strading. The April crude contract was up 17 cents to $16.89 abarrel.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the futures price ofcrude for April delivery reached an intraday high of $18.37,only to fall back by the close to $17.94 a barrel. That wasup three cents a barrel from Friday. The May crude contractwas up a similar amount.   However, heating oil for March delivery rose 1.81 cents agallon to settle at 61.95 cents on the New York MercantileExchange, and March gasoline was up 1.32 cents a gallon at60.65 cents. According to Dow Jones International PetroleumReport, anticipation of greater demand for products during alarge ground offensive spurred buying of the March fuelcontracts.   Six of the 13 oil ministers of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries met in Vienna yesterday todiscuss OPEC's postwar oil production, but oil marketsignored the informal talks.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices jumped onreports of parched soybean growing regions in southern Braziland northern Argentina. Soybean futures for March deliverygained 6.25 cents a bushel to close at $5.7575 in activetrading on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures traders andanalysts, anxious after weeks of sluggish markets anddeclining prices, were quick to embrace the move as aharbinger of happier days and more volatile prices to come.&quot;This is our first weather rally since 1988,&quot; gushed oneanalyst in Chicago. He conceded in a calmer moment that oneday doesn't a rally make, though he remained optimistic thatsoybean futures prices will move higher. So far this month,the soybean growing regions of Brazil have had only 17% to22% of normal precipitation. The Brazilian soybean crop is inthe crucial pod-filling phase; too little moisture and theplant will drop its pods to survive, which would sharplyreduce crop yields. Many analysts and weather forecasters hadexpected a storm front to move across southern Brazil overthe weekend. Instead, the weather front lingered overArgentina, and isn't expected to reach the Brazilian growingareas until tomorrow at the earliest, said Kevin Marcus, aforecaster with Earth Satellite Corp.'s Cropcast Servicessubsidiary. Daniel Basse, director of marketing forAgResource Co. in Chicago, said that AgResource analysts havecut their estimate of 1991's soybean harvest in Brazil's RioGrande do Sul state to five million metric tons from 6.3million metric tons last year in light of the drought-likeconditions. That state accounts for about 30% of annualsoybean production in Brazil, which is second only to theU.S. in soybean exports. The rally in the soybean pit hadonly a modest ripple effect in the nearby corn and wheattrading pits at the Board of Trade. March corn futures added1.25 cents a bushel to close at $2.395, and March wheatfutures gained 1.75 cents a bushel to close at $2.535.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose. Gold for Aprildelivery ended $2.50 an ounce higher at $360.80. March silverrose 6.7 cents an ounce to $3.577. Indications that theMideast war may be nearing its end revived traders' optimismfor a postwar economic recovery, stimulating a rise in goldand silver, according to analysts and traders. Short-coveringin silver accelerated the trend, said Ian MacDonald, vicepresident of precious metals at Credit Suisse. Investors&quot;cover&quot; short positions by buying contracts to offsetprevious bets that prices would fall. Anticipation of supplydisruptions from Industrias Penoles in Mexico, the world'slargest silver mine, also contributed to silver's rise, saidDinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader at Chase Manhattan Bank.Penoles miners have been on strike since mid-February, andlast week the concern said it was unable to fulfill most ofits silver shipments. Mr. Mehta added that silver's recentweakness has been puzzling. Demand in the photographyindustry, where silver is used, isn't affected much byrecessions; silver jewelry demand rises during economicdownturns as consumers switch from more expensive goldjewelry, and the reduction in copper production means lesssilver byproduct is turned out, he said. &quot;Silver is thesleeper,&quot; Mr. Mehta said, adding he wouldn't be surprised tosee silver continue to rise.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices rose. March copper finished 3.05cents a pound higher at $1.136. The U.S. market followedstronger-than-usual buying in London by trading companies,said Richard Hirsch, vice president of Sharps Pixley Inc.Fred Demler, a metals economist at PaineWebber, tied the riseto expectations of an economic recovery after the PersianGulf war ends. Rebuilding Kuwait will increase copper demand,he said, but more important are expectations the auto andhousing industries will turn around on lower interest ratesand oil prices and heightened consumer confidence after thewar ends. Copper supplies are tight, he adds, notingworld-wide inventories represent 4.1 weeks of usage, wellbelow a normal level of about five to six weeks. &quot;If we see aresurgence in demand,&quot; he said, &quot;we could see some temporaryshortages occurring.&quot; Copper's strength yesterday wasexaggerated by technical factors, said William O'Neill,futures strategist at Merrill Lynch. But the rise above the$1.12 level indicates copper will continue rising, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
