Should I deny a patient appropriatemedical care because of the cost? Read as: Are specialistswith their so-called unnecessary, expensive diagnostic testsand treatments the real culprits of Medicare's high costs?   Patients come to us with their illnesses, expectingappropriate care. Overuse of tests and procedures is labeledthe culprit. I submit that today expensive tests andprocedures are done to practice good medicine and that goodmedicine is, by virtue, defensible medicine. Few things aredone that are not indicated.</LP><TEXT>   Medicare's creation in 1965 allowed people to havegenerally greater access to medical care. During the yearsMedicare was affordable, the quality and duration of life formost beneficiaries increased. This was the presumed goal.Now, as expertise to design, create and administer newtechnologies or drugs has become more expensive and theavailability continues to be allowed for all, the result isgreater expense. Will controlling the specialists and theirservices regulate costs? Yes, but as the Medicare gatekeeperforces patients to queue at the door to be covered by fewerand fewer physicians -- who, overcome by paperwork andreimbursements below costs, will head for other pastures --the American public will realize too late that it's been had.   Thomas W. Andrews, M.D.   Longwood, Fla.   ---   I've had a family practice for 40 years, and I have a fewsuggestions in reaction to Dr. Stern's article:   -- The young doctors today do not treat poor people inclinics like we older guys used to do. Even if you don't getyour full fee, Doctor, you get something that is better thannothing. It's the spirit of giving that is important. It willmake your heart feel good and you will live longer notworrying about your money.   -- Don't be frightened -- your future is not grim, it issecure. You have the best of all professions, you will alwaysbe needed. You might suffer a slight drop in your income, butyou will still live well and have a position among yourpeers.   I personally don't see the present system operating toomuch longer in the U.S. There is too much use of technology.   Be of good heart and enjoy what you are doing forhumankind.   Ian MacDonald, M.D.   Orlando, Fla.</TEXT></DOC>
