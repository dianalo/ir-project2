But the telecommunications concern's operating losses continued, and auditor Price Waterhouse again issued a qualified opinion of its financial statements.    In the year-earlier quarter, when Western Union recorded asset write-downs and related charges of $362 million, it had a net loss of $459.9 million.    In the latest quarter, before gains of $152.8 million from the extinguishment of debt, Western Union had an operating loss of $47.5 million. Revenue fell 11% to $190.9 million from $213.6 million.    Except for a small profit in 1987's third quarter because of an asset sale, Western Union's net in the latest quarter was its first quarterly profit since the second quarter of 1984, a spokesman said.    Price Waterhouse has issued a qualified opinion of Western Union's financial data each year since 1984. Western Union said the opinion for 1987 will be qualified &quot;with respect to uncertainties surrounding Western Union's ability to satisfy its funding needs and regarding the possible disposition of assets below their recorded values.&quot;    In 1987, Western Union had earnings, after the gains in the latest quarter, of $88.1 million, or $2.58 a share, compared with a loss of $531.2 million a year earlier. The latest year's earnings marked the company's first full-year profit since 1982.    Western Union had a 1987 operating loss of $64.7 million. In 1986, the company had a loss of $542.4 million from continuing operations. The 1986 net loss included profit from discontinued operations and extraordinary losses.    Revenue fell 9.8% to $801.9 million from $889.2 million. Western Union cited a continuing decline of its telex business.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Western Union shares closed at $3.50, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
