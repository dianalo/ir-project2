The House bill calls for coordinating research with othercountries and international organizations, including the WorldMeteorological Organization and the U.N. Environmental Program.   ``We oppose the enactment of the bill as unnecessary because itduplicates existing government function and authority,'' saidWiiliam E. Evans, undersecretary for oceans and atmosphere in theCommerce Department.   He objected to asking federal agencies to take the globalenvironment into consideration on the ground that the governmentalready has the power to do that.   ``The administration is currently reviewing this issue,'' hesaid.   Dalas L. Peck, director of the U.S. Geological Survey, singledout the bill's provision for a ``Council on Global EnvironmentalPolicy'' as unnecessary because the federal government already hasthe Council on Environmental Quality. He also opposed givingCongress a say in setting the way the administration handles itsbudget.   Both Evans and Peck endorsed the purpose of the bill, whichseeks to advance scientific understanding of global climate changesand to provide a basis for the government's policy decisions.   It was introduced by Rep. Walter B. Jones, D-N.C., chairman ofthe House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. Wednesday'shearing was held by its subcommittee on Oceanography and the GreatLakes.   The bill was endorsed by Stephen H. Schneider of the NationalCenter for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., which issponsored by the National Science Foundation.   ``Such a measure to coordinate federal activities in globalchange research and the policy implications of global change islong overdue,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
