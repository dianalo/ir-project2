There are the &quot;when we's,&quot; who always talk about the days &quot;when we&quot; were running things in Rhodesia. And there are the &quot;I told you so's,&quot; who are forever warning that the Rhodesian experience will repeat itself in South Africa.    Charles Pienaar and Matthew Taylor were &quot;I told you so's.&quot;    &quot;I got a great sense of deja vu in South Africa,&quot; says the 35-year-old Mr. Pienaar, a farmer who crossed the Limpopo River into South Africa in 1983. &quot;What's going on in South Africa, I'd seen happen before in Rhodesia. I'd tell this to the South Africans and they'd say, 'You Rhodesians think you know it all.' You know, people don't want to learn from history.&quot;    &quot;The South Africans call us hemorrhoids, because they say we're a pain in the butt,&quot; says Mr. Taylor, 28, an agronomist who moved south in 1982. &quot;What we say disturbs them.&quot;    Disillusioned with their new country and the hardened attitudes against political change that they encountered there, both men returned home to Zimbabwe, Mr. Taylor in 1985, Mr. Pienaar earlier this year. They both feared that if they stayed, they would end up fighting in another civil war. &quot;Moving from Rhodesia to South Africa,&quot; says Mr. Taylor, &quot;was like jumping from the frying pan into the fire.&quot;    Their experiences as &quot;I told you so's&quot; in South Africa illustrate a common characteristic of the white man in Africa: a reluctance to learn from, and adapt to, the tide of black liberation as it has swept southward across the continent. &quot;You can talk about the folly of man being repeated until you're blue in the face, and it doesn't help,&quot; says Mr. Taylor. &quot;Everyone has to repeat the folly for themselves.&quot;    Denis Norman, a white farmer and businessman in Zimbabwe who was on hand for the Rhodesian-war peace negotiations in London, says the white Rhodesians didn't learn the value of negotiations until it was too late -- when they had a knife at their throat.    &quot;You just have to start talking and you'll be surprised at how quickly you can come to workable arrangements,&quot; Mr. Norman says. &quot;Look, you don't have to love the other guy, but you have to come to an understanding. You must never give up that attempt. Somewhere along the line, South Africa has to come to this conclusion.&quot;    The white settlers in Kenya, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and Rhodesia all felt that their situations were unique and that they would eventually prevail. This same feeling is endemic among white South Africans who are making the last stand against black majority rule in Africa.    The situation in South Africa is indeed unique in several ways. First, there is no other place in Africa for the whites to retreat to; all the rivers have been crossed. Second, the numbers are far different; there are five million whites in South Africa, far more than in the rest of Africa combined, and their army is the strongest on the continent. Third, the Afrikaners have been living in South Africa for 300 years -- and think of themselves as the white tribe of Africa.    Still, there are some similarities in South Africa to what has happened elsewhere on the continent. The Pretoria government has shown the same unwillingness to negotiate with exiled black leaders who are waging a terrorist campaign from outside the country. The international condemnation and sanctions are the same that eventually -- albeit after 15 years -- helped to weaken the whites' resolve in Rhodesia. And the fear of the whites that they will be driven out of the country, or worse, is the same fear that has haunted whites across the continent.    The white Zimbabweans, with perfect hindsight, feel their perspective can be of some help to their neighbors. They have seen that their refusal to negotiate resulted in a long and bloody war that only delayed the inevitable. They learned that sanctions may help the local economy for a while by stimulating self-sufficiency but that they eventually prove a hindrance by limiting access to new technology and world markets. They have learned, too, that there can be life for whites under black rule.    Michael Townsend, a white Zimbabwean farmer who was on the front line of the Rhodesian bush war, shakes his head when he thinks about South Africa's future. &quot;It is quite horrifying to hear them {white South Africans} saying the same things we said,&quot; he says. &quot;It's sad. We didn't listen to anyone else, and neither do they.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;The 'Rhodies': Zimbabwe's Whites Discover Life Goes On After Black Liberation --- Worst Fears Aren't Realized, But Others Come to Pass; A Fine Sunday for Rugby --- A Lesson for South Africans?&quot; -- WSJ Aug. 14, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
