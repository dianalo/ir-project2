The son of Greek immigrants, Dukakis says the message of hiscampaign is ``good jobs and real opportunity'' for all, withspecial emphasis on education and research.   Speaking of his own family's success story, Dukakis says, ``I amrunning for president because I believe all Americans have a rightto share in that dream. I believe I have the strength to run thiscountry, the experience to manage our government, and the values tolead our people.''   He says the United States cannot stand ``four more years ofcredit-card economics.'' But he has proposed tougher taxcollection, not tax increases, as the key to reducing the deficit,and claimed it could bring in as much as $110 billion from taxscofflaws and cheats.   He has been an outspoken critic of the Reagan administration'sStrategic Defense Initiative and its aid to the Contra rebels inNicaragua.   He proposes to expand support for education and overhaul welfareprograms along the lines of Massachusetts' successful effort toplace welfare recipients in jobs.   Dukakis has also proposed a universal health insurance programfor workers in his home state and asked, ``Isn't is about time thatthis nation committed itself to basic health security for itscitizens?''   He has espoused public-private partnerships to tackle problemssuch as housing and homelessness.   He opposes the Gephardt amendment in the House-passed tradebill, which would mandate automatic U.S. retaliation againstcountries that fail to trim their trade supluses.</TEXT><HEAD>RICHARD GEPHARDT</HEAD><TEXT>   No candidate has summarized his campaign in fewer words thanGephardt, 47, a veteran of six terms in Congress from St. Louis,Mo.: ``It's your fight, too!''   Behind those pugnacious words is a candidate who has led effortsin Congress to take a tough stance against countries with hugeimbalances in their trade accounts with the United States.   To his critics, the Gephardt amendment to the trade bill smacksof protectionism that could lead the world into a tariff war withno winners.   But for Gephardt, with his now famous commercial about the$48,000 Hyundai _ which is what he claims the Korean car would sellfor if the U.S. applied the same tariffs that the Koreans do onimports _ it is simply a way of letting the world know that theUnited States means business.   Gephardt voted for President Reagan's big cut in tax rates in1981. He has been a leading opponent of aid to the NicaraguanContra rebels.   He has called for a new agriculture policy to help familyfarmers, and accused corporate America of being greedy andshort-sighted.   Once an opponent of abortion, Gephardt now opposes efforts topass a constitutional amendment to make abortion illegal.</TEXT><HEAD>ALBERT GORE JR.</HEAD><TEXT>   The Tennessee senator, who turns 40 on March 31, has tried toestablish himself as the conservative in the Democratic field,although he has been a liberal on social issues and health programsduring his 11 years in Congress (the past three in the Senate).   ``I choose to stand up for what I believe in: an end to the armsrace, environmental protection, better schools and economicstrength,'' says Gore.   Gore has voted in the past for humanitarian aid for the Contrarebels, although he opposed the Reagan administration's most recentrequest. He opposes military aid to the Contras.   The son of a senator, Gore has built his campaign around aSouthern strategy, hoping that a strong showing there willvindicate his decision not to contest the Iowa caucuses and NewHampshire primary.   He claims to differ from the other Democrats with his supportfor Reagan policy in the Persian Gulf, the invasion of Grenada andthe Midgetman missile.</TEXT><HEAD>GARY HART</HEAD><TEXT>   Hart, the former Colorado senator, has hitched his off-again,on-again campaign to his ``new ideas,'' including military reformand economic restructuring.   He has offered the most detailed budget blueprint of anycandidate, outlining plans to cut the deficit by more than $100billion by 1993 and to balance it by 1995.   His blueprint includes cuts in military spending and farmsubsidies. He would raise the minimum wage and provide more aid forschools and colleges. He wants to impose a $10-per-barrel fee onoil imports and keep the top tax rate at 33 percent forupper-income taxpayers.   Hart would also make wealthy Social Security recipients payincome taxes on 85 percent of their benefits, tax capital gains atdeath, raise cigarette and liquor taxes, and impose a 10-percentlevy on purchases of furs, planes and other luxuries.</TEXT><HEAD>JESSE JACKSON</HEAD><TEXT>   The Baptist minister and civil rights leader has called formajor cuts in Pentagon spending and major increases in federalspending on schools and other social programs.   Jackson, 46, a native of South Carolina who now lives inChicago, has called for ``an end to economic violence.''   ``There's something wrong when corporate owners make exhorbitantprofits while workers lose their jobs,'' says Jackson. ``Theworkers must unite across lines and race, sex and religion.''   Jackson has called Star Wars ``an impossible technologicalsolution to a political problem. It will cost over a trilliondollars if pursued, and in the end will not produce a defense butan arms race in the heavens.''   He has proposed keeping a 38.5 percent tax bracket for wealthyAmericans and promised to reduce the deficit by cutting militaryspending ``without cutting our defense, make corporations and thewealthy pay their fair share of taxes and put America back towork.''   Jackson says reducing the trade deficit will require``controlling U.S.-based multi-nationals which close U.S. factoriesand take jobs overseas'' and ``increasing Third World livingstandards so they can buy more from us.''</TEXT><HEAD>PAUL SIMON</HEAD><TEXT>   ``I'm not a neo-anything,'' boasts the Illinois senator. ``I'm aDemocrat.''   ``I'm proud to stand up for the values of Franklin Roosevelt,Harry Truman and Jack Kennedy. I stand for leadership that cares,''he told the Roosevelt Center.   Simon is a longtime supporter of federal education programs andauthor of 11 books, including one decrying Americans' ignorance offoreign languages.   To get people back to work, Simon has proposed an $8 billion,last-resort public works program that would pay 10 percent morethan welfare or unemployment could offer.   He has promised to send Congress within 60 days of taking office``a comprehensive long-term (care) program that will move on thehuge unmet long-term care needs our society has.''   He believes that reducing the unemployment rate and loweringinterest rates are the keys to cutting the federal deficit. Ifnecessary, he says, he will seek an income tax surcharge on thewealthy.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 6</NOTE></DOC>
