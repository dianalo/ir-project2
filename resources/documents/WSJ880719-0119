Miller (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AAPL </CO><IN> ERN EDP </IN><TEXT>   Apple Computer Inc., helped by solid growth in international sales and a continued strong domestic market, said net income jumped 71% in its third quarter ended July 1, on a 56% increase in sales.    The Cupertino, Calif., maker of personal computers said net income was $91.3 million, or 71 cents a share, up sharply from $53.5 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier.    The company's sales marginally topped most analysts' expectations by nearly reaching the billion-dollar mark; Apple recorded $993.1 million in sales in the latest period, compared with $637.1 million a year earlier.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Apple shares closed at $45.50, up 50 cents.    International sales represented 38% of the company's sales in the latest period, up from 32% of total sales in the year-earlier quarter. The jump in international sales is &quot;the highlight&quot; of Apple's earnings, according to Dillon, Read andamp; Co. analyst John C. Maxwell III. Mr. Maxwell said Apple is &quot;hitting on all cylinders&quot; in Europe, enjoying success in the corporate, education and consumer computer markets.    The company has a good marketing and distribution strategy in Europe, and has &quot;recognized the growth opportunity&quot; there, Mr. Maxwell said. The European personal computer market has recently &quot;exhibited the kind of appetite we've seen here in the last couple years,&quot; the analyst added.    David Readerman, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., also cited international sales as a &quot;strong factor&quot; in Apple's results, which slightly exceeded his expectations. Mr. Readerman added that international sales tend to provide a slightly higher margin than do domestic sales.    &quot;The real concern&quot; in the latest quarter, Mr. Readerman said, had been how Apple's margins would fare as the spike in memory-chip prices that has been hampering all computer makers continued. &quot;In fact, gross margins were a rather respectable 51.5%&quot; in the fiscal third quarter, he said, following the second quarter's 52.1%.    Apple said, &quot;We continue to make good progress in business markets with our Macintosh personal computers,&quot; and said that demand for its top-of-the-line Macintosh II model &quot;grew significantly&quot; in the period. In addition, it said its educational sales are &quot;experiencing strong momentum.&quot;    &quot;Based on continued strong demand for our product families,&quot; Apple said it is &quot;optimistic that this favorable performance will continue throughout the remainder of fiscal 1988.&quot;    Dillon Read's Mr. Maxwell said he expects Apple to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of about 81 cents a share, or an indicated $104.5 million, on sales of $1.15 billion. His estimate would represent a 46% increase in earnings, on doubled sales. Fourth-quarter margins will slip slightly, he predicted, as the company continues to use higher-priced memory chips purchased during the current shortage, and as lower-margin sales to the education market reach their annual peak in the fourth period.    For the nine months, Apple said net income doubled to $292.3 million, or $2.24 a share, from $145.8 million, or $1.11 a share. Nine-month sales rose 55% to $2.9 billion from $1.87 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
