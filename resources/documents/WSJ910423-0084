Seeking to counter growing criticism of their graduates,deans of the nation's nearly 700 business schools areexpected today to approve new rules governing what theirinstitutions teach and how they teach it.</LP><TEXT>   Among other effects, the revised accreditation standardsmay provide a way for weaker schools to survive an expectedshakeout in the crowded business-school market.   The changes will encourage the schools to turn outmanagers who are more human, savvy and worldly wise -- versedin the environment, workplace diversity and other topics thattoday's typical M.B.A. knows little about. The rules urgegreater attention to teaching and exhort new professors to domore real-world research -- a bow to charges that mostbusiness-school studies these days don't address the waycompanies are actually run.   But the standards will also allow schools new freedom topackage courses and assemble faculty as they see fit. Thismay lead many institutions to pursue narrow specialties --focusing on retailing, for instance, or lucrative executiveprograms. Such a change could substantially alter the makeupof the business-school market, now flooded with playersstriving -- and failing -- to emulate the breadth of aHarvard or Wharton.   &quot;We're not implying any longer that you've got to dothings one way,&quot; says William K. Laidlaw, executive vicepresident of the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools ofBusiness, the group that will vote on the new accreditingstandards at its convention today in St. Louis. &quot;We're sayingto schools: Think about your market and do some strategicplanning.&quot;   The changes -- two years in the planning -- represent ahumbling acknowledgment among business schools that theirlong period of ascendancy may be ending. There has beengrowing criticism that many business graduates arenarrow-minded number crunchers, ill-prepared to manage in afast-changing global marketplace. Companies have added to thegrumbling -- and many trimmed their M.B.A. hiring even beforethe recession.   In addition, universities fear plummeting demand forbusiness degrees. A drop in the number of college-agedstudents means fewer undergraduate business majors. It alsospells a slide in interest in M.B.A. programs, which haven'tbeen helped by reports of widespread unemployment amongrecent M.B.A.s. Indeed, many schools this year report aleveling off of applications -- and in some cases, a drop --after two decades of heady growth.   Not surprisingly, pressure for less restrictiveaccreditation standards has been greatest from those businessschools that have benefited most from the business-degreeboom -- and that stand to suffer most if the boom goes bust.   Typical is the 14-year-old unaccredited business school atGeorgia College, Milledgeville, Ga. It graduates about 1,500four-year business majors and 420 M.B.A.s each year -- about50% more of each than five years ago. It focuses on teachingand can't afford to support a faculty that can produce theamount and kind of research considered critical to gainingaccreditation under current standards.   For years, that hasn't hindered growth. But now, thestate-supported school faces growing questions fromapplicants exposed to marketing pitches from nearbyinstitutions plugging their accredited status.   &quot;We're under pressure to compete more aggressively,&quot; saysJoAnn Jones, Georgia College's business dean. &quot;With the newstandards, it becomes a realistic possibility to get thestamp that will allow us to compete and still keep ourteaching focus.&quot;   The rules cover all business-degree programs fromundergraduate to advanced. With the changes, schools seekingaccreditation will be judged not by a single model but by howwell they meet self-defined &quot;missions.&quot; For instance,professors at a local, teaching-oriented school won't beexpected to churn out the same volume of basic research asthose at a school declaring itself an international researchinstitution. And the definition of business faculty willbecome broader, too -- offering greater sanction forinstructors with experience other than formal, academictraining.   Not that uniform standards will disappear completely. Acore of traditional subjects -- from accounting toorganizational behavior -- will still be required. And newtopics -- including ethics, global business, and the impactof demographic diversity on the workplace -- will becomemandatory. But the rules, stressing a desire for creativityand innovation, make few demands about the structure ofcurricula.   Some worry that by explicitly encouraging diversity, thenew standards might dilute the quality of accreditation.&quot;When you increase the flexibility, and people choosedifferent niches, will that produce a group of first- andsecond-class citizens?&quot; asks R. Bruce Hutton, dean of theUniversity of Denver's accredited business school.   The results won't be known immediately. The new standardswon't be phased in fully for three years -- and even then,may not succeed in averting a split between richer and poorerschools. Hundreds of schools now lacking accreditation fromthe American Assembly have formed a competing accreditingbody -- and have threatened to secede if the new standardsdon't prove more inclusive.</TEXT></DOC>
