June delivery West Texas Intermediate, the bellwether U.S. crude oil, closed 33 cents a barrel lower at $18.27, just above the low of the day. Earlier, it rose as high as $18.77, up 17 cents. Heating oil for June delivery declined 0.58 cent a gallon to 49.15 cents and June gasoline was off 0.07 cent a gallon to 52.29 cents.    Prices started off on a firm note following a news report that a tentative agreement had been reached between representatives of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers to curtail non-OPEC exports 5% and to cut OPEC production a similar amount.    The rally lacked a follow-through, however, and when selling developed, prices slid quickly. After a series of ups and downs, price action culminated in prolonged weakness in the afternoon.    Analysts said previous buyers quickly tried to take profits, accelerating the wide price swings and the decline. At one point prices recovered momentarily on a rumor that the Soviet Union would join the output reduction, they said.    James Fiedler, a broker at E.D.andamp;F. Man International Futures Inc., said a wire report that cited a source close to OPEC as saying no agreement would be reached between OPEC and non-OPEC nations caused selling early in the day. Mr. Fiedler said selling was mostly from one large trade firm that sold persistently through the day.    Edward Ryan, a trader with the energy group at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said traders kept watch for news and reacted to developments.    &quot;At one point the volume of trading slowed down and the selling broke through the $18.50 level in the June contract,&quot; he said. This move triggered stop-loss selling that accelerated the decline, he said.    Meanwhile, analysts were speculating how the Vienna meeting might turn out. Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets said that a major stumbling block to an accord between OPEC and non-OPEC nations would be the inability to verify how much non-OPEC nations cut their exports.    Also, he said, non-OPEC nations want a proportionate response from OPEC members, which would amount to a reduction of some 700,000 barrels daily. &quot;I think most OPEC nations would resist that,&quot; he said.    But John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc., New York, said he didn't think OPEC members would completely reject an agreement with non-OPEC nations.    &quot;A possibility is that they will say they agree in principle but are examining the situation,&quot; he said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold, silver and platinum futures rose, mostly in sympathy with surging oil prices early in the day. Silver was also boosted by heavy buying by one commodity fund, traders said. But volume continued to be light. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold closed at $452.30 an ounce, up $2.50. Silver rose 11.7 cents to $6.498 an ounce, and platinum on the New York Mercantile Exchange gained $6.50 an ounce to $526.20. &quot;Even when crude (prices) came off, silver wasn't affected because of the continued fund buying,&quot; said David Sobotka, manager of bullion trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Still, Mr. Sobotka and other analysts said investor interest remains weak, especially compared with oil markets. &quot;Metals is not where the activity is,&quot; said Mr. Sobotka.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle futures prices rose as the spot price of choice steer carcasses hit $1.07 a pound, the highest price so far this year, said Jerry Abbenhaus, a livestock analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc., St. Louis. Cash prices rose primarily because of strong demand by meat wholesalers. The corresponding rise in futures prices also indicates that futures traders are shrugging off a feedlot survey by the Agriculture Department last week that showed a large number of cattle heavy enough for slaughter. Analysts are reasoning that if a backlog of fattened cattle were developing, meatpackers would be bidding cash prices lower.    COPPER: Futures prices rebounded from recent weakness despite the absence of any new developments. May delivery copper rose 2.45 cents a pound to 91.80 cents. Among price-strengthening factors, one analyst said, was that the gross national product showed some improvement and precious metals were firmer, while the dollar was down. But he said the recovery was largely technical, following a 22-cent-a-pound drop in the May contract since April 4. Another analyst suggested yesterday's buying was profit-taking by traders who were offsetting contracts they had previously sold short in anticipation of price declines. </TEXT></DOC>
