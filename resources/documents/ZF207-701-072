 In 1988, audio compact discs outsold vinyl 33-rpmrecords by 2 to 1, much as 33s had long ago replaced 78s.andP;  The reasonandM;for this is simple: Optical discs hold more music at a higher fidelity thando LPs, they're small, and they're virtually indestructible.andP;  So it seemslogical that laser optical discs will soon replace the hard disks connectedto our Macs, right?andM;Don't put any money on it.andP;  For most users, they're neither an alternative toharddisks nor viable backupandM;media.andP;  It's not that optical discs are a fad; on the contrary, optical discsare probably where audio CDs were in the music market six years ago.andP;  It'sandM;just that claims that optical technology is taking over the market are asymptom of nearsightedness.andP;  Hard disks did not replace floppies but added anew dimension to desktop comput-ing.andP;  Similarly, optical discs will performnew tasks not yet common on desktop computers, replacing noncomputertechnologies such as microfiche.andP;  Optical discs are the last piece of atechnology jigsaw puzzle that is already being used to revolutionize the waysome companies operate.andM;Many optical technologies are in development, but three types of opticaldiscs have hit the mainstream market: CD-ROM (compact- disc-read-onlymemory), WORM (write once, read many), and erasable.andP;  They're not compatiblewith each other, but then, your VCR doesn't play audiocassettes either.andP;  Eachis suited for particular jobs and users, which I'll identify as I give you alook at a representative sampling of some of the dozens of optical-discdrives available for the Mac.andM;Read (Only) Me FirstandM;CD-ROM is the oldest desktop optical technology and has the most-developedstandards, giving CD- ROMs portability among different drives and computers.andO;The two main standards are the High Sierra standard and the InternationalStandards Organization (ISO) standard, which grew out of High Sierra.andP;  Ifdrive and disc vendors implement the standards, a disc can be shared aniongPCs and Macs by using one set of data but two sets of header and driverinformation.andP;  Most CD-ROM drives can even play audio CDs, which are the samesize.andM;Enthusiasts are excited about CD- ROM technology because it provides a greatdistribution medium.andP;  A disc can hold 650 megabytes of data, is compact (4.75inches in diameter), and is an enduring storage medium.andP;  Discs are also notall that expensive to produce.andP;  A 100-disc pressing can run about $3,000,with per-disc costs decreasing with increasing production volume.andP;  On adollar-per-megabyte basis, CD-ROM is not a bad deal for software publishers,especially if they have a lot of software to publish.andP;  These costs are likelyto come down further with the appearance of CD- ROM-mastering servicebureaus.andP;  For about $150,000, small businesses can offer data capture,editing, indexing, formatting, encoding, and output of CD-ROM discs by usingthe TOPIX CD-R system from Optical Media International of Los Gatos,California.andP;  (For information on other CD- ROM mastering systems, see&quot;Optical Horizons,&quot; June  88.)andM;But despite all these benefits to users and disc publishers and even thoughdrives have been on the market for several years, CD-ROM technology justhasn't taken off yet.andP;  According to InfoTech, a consulting and research firm,there were approximately 170,000 CD-ROM drives on users' desks last winter -that's less than I drive for every 100 to 150 PCs.andP;  CD-ROM penetration iseven lower on the Macintosh side, with 5,000 to 15,000 drives working withsome 2.5andM;million Macintoshes, according to industry sources.andP;  What's wrong with thispicture?andM;CD-ROM discs are read-only, but that limitation hasn't prevented audiocompact discs from obtaining market success.andP;  One problem with CD-ROM drivesis their performance, which is even slower than that of floppy-disk drives.andO;Nevertheless, no one has abandoned floppydisk drives completely, because theyare still useful for loading and backing up files and programs.andP;  The mainroadblock is the old chicken-and egg syndrome that plagues any newdistribution medium: Users are waiting for a reason to buy a drive (that is,published titles), and developers are waiting for a reason to publish (thatis, a large installed user base).andP;  Some large companies have created theirown tities, using CD-ROMs to distribute database information such as companystatistics and customer lists.andP;  In fact, most drives now are being used bylarge companies.andP;  For a company spread out over several states, having itsown CD-ROM distribution system is less expensive than creating a giantnetwork.andM;It wi 11 take a good bit of innovative third-party publishing to make CD- ROMdrives as common as printers in offices.andM;Actually, use of the drives is starting to become more widespread.andP;  CD- ROMtelephone directories are sprouting up, and Digital Electronies is puttingits VMS operating-system documentation onto CD-ROMS.andP;  For desktop publishers,there are discsandM;full of clip art.andP;  There's even a disc to help you create, master, andpublish CD-ROMs: CD-ROM Developers Lab from Software Mart of Austin, Texas.andM;CD-ROMs on the Mac offer combined text, graphics, and sound.andP;  The WholeEarthCatalog, that Sears catalog of the counter culture, is now available as aCD-ROM HyperCard stack from Broderbund of San Rafael, California.andP;  Appleadvocates are using HyperCard as a front end to the large amounts of data onCD-ROMS.andP;  The Whole Earth disc features scanned photographs and diagrams frompages of how-to books, indexes by section and by word, and music.andP;  Click on abutton, and you get a 60- second sample of the recording you're readingabout.andM;For those of you in the market for conventional business applications,Microsoft has a disc for which it might be worth buying a CD-ROM drive.andP;  TheMicrosof Office is a single disc containing Word, Excel, Mail, andPowerPoint.andP;  On-line documentation includes animated help sequences withsound and the ability to search disc files by word.andP;  The disc also includes avariety of third-party software, such as Excel templates from Heizer, SiliconBeach's SuperPaint, and 350 Adobe fonts.andP;  At $949, it is quite a savings overthe price of the products separately.andM;But whether CD-ROM technology will take charge in the computer market the wayits audio counterpart did in the consumer market is still a matter ofspeculation.andM;WORM and ErasableandM;WORM and erasable discs are in a different market altogether.andP;  UnlikeCD-ROMs, their main purpose is not to serve as distribution media but insteadto be used for mass Storage.andP;  They're big, removable, and stable.andP;  And youcan write data to them.andM;Each type of optical disc comes in a 5.3-x-6-inch cartridge.andP;  Most of thedouble-sided cartridges hold 650 megabytes per side, and gigabyte sizes arebecoming more common.andP;  Most WORM and erasable drives produced for the Macalso work with a PC, the difference being only in the driver software.andO;However, most cartridges from different vendors are incompatible with eachother and between Macs and PCs because neither of the technologies hasstandards such as those that CD-ROMs enjoy.andM;WORM is the older of the two technologies; it started on mainframes and thenmigrated to desktops (see &quot;Optical Horizons,&quot; June  88).andP;  By contrast, thefirst erasable drives were introduced this year.andP;  Most erasable drives useoptical assemblies from one of two OEMs - Ricoh and Sony.andP;  Maxtor was gettingready to ship its own assembly in August.andM;Last year, Steve Jobs made a big stir in the optical-drive industry byannouncing that his NEXT computer would come with an erasable optical drive.andO;Since then, the erasable market has exploded, with some 15 drives for theMac, and more on the way.andP;  Many people predicted that the advent of erasabletechnology would be the death knell for WORM opticalandM;discs.andP;  In fact, just the opposite has happened.andP;  With erasable technologynow on the frontier, WORM has become a safer bet in the minds of users,causing a spurt in the number of vendors producing WORM drives for the Mac.andM;WORM drives are guaranteed aandM;place in the market because they are much better for archiving than erasabledrives are.andP;  Current erasable drives all use magneto-optic technology, inwhich a laser heats the medium, changing its magnetic polarity.andP;  Thistechnique gives the data an estimated life of ten years.andP;  WORMandM;drives burn holes into the medium, giving data at least 100 years of life.andO;In fact, WORM data can outlast modem paper, which, because of its acidcontent, begins to crumble after a few decades.andM;Who Needs it?andM;The thought of unlimited storage on gigabyte cartridges is enough to makedesktop publishers and CAD users drool, but optical storage doesn't begin tolook economically attractive until you require about 500 megabytes.andP;  A650-megabyte hard disk can cost  8,000, whereas most erasable drives arecurrently in the  4,000-to-$6,000 range.andP;  WORM drives are less expensive thanerasable drives, retailing at $2,000 to $4,000  each.andP;  Optical discs anddrives are also less easily damaged when moved about than are fragile harddisks.andM;But don't throw away your harddisk drive just yet.andP;  Although WORM anderasable drives are faster than CD-ROM drives, professionals currently findall optical drives too slow for running the Mac operating system.andP;  In fact,at the time of this writing, neither the Sony nor Ricoh erasable drive couldbe used as a startup device when a hard disk was also attached to the Mac.andM;There are applications for which optical media are the best choice, though.andO;For example, WORM drives are increasingly replacing tape for mastering CD-ROMbecause WORM drives provide random access.andP;  Also, engineers can put erasabledrives to good use for data-acquisition tasks.andP;  Parallel Geosciences ofAustin, Texas, includes an erasable optical drive with its RISC-enhanced,Macintosh-based system, which collects and analyzes geophysical data for theoil industry.andP;  In this data-acquisition process, a single data set can occupyseveral hundred megabytes.andM;Vertical applications such as these may be interesting, but the biggestgrowth potential for optical-disc technology lies beyond the desk to .andM;Although all optical-disc technology is used in desktop publishing, erasableand WORM drives combined with scanners, networks, and file servers have thepotential for going far beyond desktop publishing.andP;  At an industry conferencelast winter, Larry Miller of Caere (producer of Omni- Pageoptical-character-reader software) predicted that 60 percent of scanners willbe used for tasks otherandM;than desktop publishing.andP;  He was talking about document processing andon-line archiving, which are made possible only by writable optical discs.andM;Processing DocumentsandM;Information technology in business has witnessed a progression in the pastthree decades from centralized data processors in the  60s andandM;isolated word processors in the  70s toward distributed networked documentprocessing in the '80s.andP;  Whereas word processing deals mostly with printedtext and, of late, some graphics, document processing handles both of theseplus handwritten text.andP;  Typed or handwritten documents with signatures can bescanned into networks as bit-mapped images and stored on optical discs,saving time in both input and output - no data entry and no looking throughshoe boxes to find a document.andM;On-line archiving is simply the ability to keep large amounts of informationon-line.andP;  Instead of scrolling through sheets of microfiche or searchingthrough a roomful of filing cabinets, users are able to type the name of adocument or a keyword to retrieve information.andP;  Users of such on-linearchiving systems - such as legal departments, medical libraries,andM;pharmaceutical companies, and the American Institute of Physics - have foundthem to greatly increase research productivity.andM;The systems we see today use Macs and PCs as graphics workstations, oftenconnected to bigger computers acting as centralized file servers.andP;  Opticaldiscs can be stored in jukeboxes, which have the capacity to hold severaldozen discs.andP;  American Express is one of the large companies that hasinstalled such a system to process the millions of documentsandM;MARS, Br+nger of integrationandM;To build a document-processing system, you can assemble the optical drives,workstations,jukeboxes, network hardware, and software yourself or buy anintegrated turnkey system from a specialized vendor.andP;  Two popular systems areFileNET, based on PCs, and Wang, based on Wang hardware.andP;  IBM and DEC areplanning systems that use their own minicomputers as file servers.andM;The Macintosh, being the archetypal intelligent graphics workstation, willmost likely fit into DEC's Compound Document Architecture system.andP;  We havealready seen some of the fruits of the agreements between DEC and AppleComputer during the past year, such as Macintosh support for transmissioncontrol protocol/Internet protocol  TCP/IP),andM;X Window, and six new application programmer interfaces (APIs).andM;But if you need a turnkey system now and don't need a mini yet, you can getMARS, a Mac-based document-processing system from Micro Dynamics.andP;  Short forMultiuser Archival and Retrieval System, MARS uses WORM or erasable opticaldiscs alone or in jukeboxes to store data from a variety of input devices -scanners, slide recorders, and even devices that scan in microfilm andX-rays.andP;  MARS can include the Calera Recognition Server to turn pictures oftext into ASCII characters.andP;  Micro Dynamics sells and sets up these devicesand provides the Macs, training, and support.andM;The heart of MARS is its specialized database, which can access millions offiles, not just the thousands boasted by generic database managers.andP;  You doneed to dedicate a MacandM;solely for the database, however.andP;  I was impressed by how quickly thedatabase manager searched for every occurrence of the word the in a largedatabase, taking only a few seconds.andM;Optical-Disc Trends and TurnsandM;Because of their speed and price, writable optical discs will create a newstorage category - that of direct-access secondary storage - but they willnot replace hard disks.andP;  Hard disks should be used for System files andoften-used applications.andP;  Most optical-disc drives will be attached tonetworks.andP;  Some CD-ROM drives may be used in networks, but they can also beused instead of networks, because they represent a less expensivedata-distribution method than networks over a wide area.andP;  The superior dataintegrity and durability of WORM discs guarantee them a place beside erasabledrives in the market.andM;Is it time to invest in optical storage now? As far as CD-ROMs go, if you canfind published discs that you can use, go ahead.andP;  The technology is solid,standards are in place, and the price is stable.andP;  But it is still not certainwhether enough titles will come out to sell drives or whether enough driveswill be sold to spur publishers on.andM;WORM drives are also solid technologically and have stable prices.andP;  Theydon't have the portability of CD-ROM drives, but portability is lessimportant forr and om-access, online archiving.andM;Erasable optical-disc technology is still new, and many people will find thatMac driver software still needs to have some minor bugs worked out.andP;  Becauseof increasing competition, the per-megabyte cost of erasable media shoulddecrease next year, making it more competitive with high-capacity magneticmedia.andP;  Industry experts expect the price of erasable drives to stabilize tothe WORM range ($2,000 to $4,000) within the next five years, with disccapacities increasing.andP;  Most people can probably afford to wait for prices tocome down, but some organizations can use optical drives right now.andP;  Forthem, a drive will pay for itself in enhanced productivity.andP;  Ex</TEXT></DOC>
