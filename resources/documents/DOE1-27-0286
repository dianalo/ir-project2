To achieve the goal at the known methodof quality control of nuclear radiation diamond detectors including ionizingirradiation of the detector, for example, by {alpha}- or {beta}-particlesbefore irradiation the detector is kept in an electric field. After fieldremoval the detector is irradiated and its applicability is determinedby a signal recorded from it with an amplitude exceeding or coincidingwith the threshold value having the same polarity as under radiationdetection by the detector in the electric field. The threshold valueis chosen to be equal to 20-40% of signal amplitude under detection ofthe same radiation by the same detector. According to the second variantthe control method comprises the following operations: the diamond detectoris connected to an voltage source and it is simultaneously irradiatedby uonizing radiation. Then irradiation is stopped and the electric fieldis removed. After transient quenching in the detecting system the detectoris irradiated by ionizing radiation again, and the detector signal isrecorded. The detectors are considered applicable, when under distortionof the space charge pulses conserve the same polarity as under ordinaryparticle detection in an electric field. In both variants time expendituresare approximately the same, they make up {similar_to} 1-2 min.</TEXT></DOC>
