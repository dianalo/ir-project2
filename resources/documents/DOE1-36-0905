The following are theresults of the studies. (1) Green Tuff oil or gas fields were classifiedby the properties of gases or oils and condensates. This revealed thatproperties of oils and condensates reflect the temperature of oil orgas layers, whereas those of gases reflect the conditions of their generation(quality and maturation level of source rocks). (2) The portion thatnaphtenic hydrocarbon holds in light hydrocarbon of oils and condensatesdepends on the temperature of oil or gas layers. (3) Chemical compositionof formation waters is closely related to alteration of reservoir rocks.The chemical composition of formation waters in the four oil or gas fieldswere different from each other, but they have the characteristics thatthe formation waters of ordinary oil or gas fields have in general.
