Treatmentsincluded non-irrigation, five irrigation schedules and three irrigationrates. Effects of treatments on vegetation were evaluated during theyear of irrigation and two succeeding years. Certain irrigation treatmentsaccelerated initial establishment of dominant, seeded perennial grasses,but benefits largely disappeared by the third growing season. Some irrigationtreatments provided longer-term enhancement of subdominant seeded shrubsand perennial forbs. Non-seeded annual species were stimulated by irrigationonly during the first growing season. The irrigation schedules implementedwere more influential on revegetation than the applied irrigation rates.</TEXT></DOC>
