Indeed, the sentiment among rescuers Friday was that ignorancewould be bliss if the whales died soon after more than $1 millionand countless hours of labor were spent trying to save them.   ``A lot of people just didn't want to know'' about their fate,said federal marine mammal biologist Jim Harvey.   Rescuers decided against affixing radio transmitters to theanimals. That entailed additional expense, and rescue coordinatorRon Morris said little scientific knowledge could be gained fromtracking a pair of young, lost whales.   But hopes were high they would survive. ``They had the will tolive. They should make it,'' Morris said.   The whales on Friday reluctantly took advantage of an escaperoute from Alaska's ice-bound northern coast afforded them by analliance of groups that are often at odds with each other: Eskimowhalers, the military, the oil industry, environmentalists, theSoviet Union and the North Slope Borough, a countylike government.   The Soviet icebreaker Vladimir Arseniev made four runs lateThursday through the last 300 yards of ice between open water andthe manmade breathing holes where the whales were resting whendarkness fell.   On its final run during the night, the Arseniev reported that onewhale entered the channel the ship had left in its wake.   But when Eskimos checked on the whales Friday morning, they stillwere in the last breathing hole. The Eskimos were prepared to resumeleading the whales to open water by cutting more holes with chainsaws.   Then the whales disappeared.   ``They were looking good,'' North Slope Borough Mayor GeorgeAhmaogak said after the last sighting of the animals.   It was several hours after dawn Friday before rescuers could taketo the air to confirm the whales were gone. No trace of them wasfound, which was interpreted favorably.   Morris said he believed the whales were on their way, sayingthere was at least three miles of open water in the direction theyhad to go to resume their annual migration to Baja California.   Originally, three whales were found trapped by an early freeze.They were discovered Oct. 13 after being stuck in the ice off PointBarrow about a week. One disappeared Oct. 21 nearly five miles fromopen water and is presumed dead.   The surviving whales, named Crossbeak and Bonnet by rescuers,were bleeding from cuts and abrasions late Thursday.   Questions were raised about the whales' apparent dependence onman's help and their attraction to the noise of the chain saws. ButHarvey said he expected the whales to revert quickly to theirnatural behavior.   Gray whales generally migrate within sight of land, usually nomore than three miles offshore, Harvey said.   Gary Hufford of the National Weather Service said that mightpresent a problem, since the ice near shore was more solid than theice farther out.   ``It's going to force them out,'' Hufford said. ``What that'sgoing to do to them, we don't know.''   Because the whales no longer can rely on the regularly spacedbreathing holes provided by the Eskimos, they would have to bewilling to search out random openings in the unstructured andconstantly changing ice ahead of them, Hufford added.   With the population of California gray whales estimated at morethan 20,000 and growing, marine mammal experts here said there is noscientific reason for special efforts to save the whales, eventhough they are considered endangered.   David Withrow, a whale specialist from the government's MarineMammal Laboratory, said the species may actually be better offwithout these two whales because they were not clever enough tomigrate in the right direction at the right time.   In the time that United States' northernmost community became thefocus of worldwide attention, native craftsmen geared up to meet thedemand for souvenirs. The whale saga also spawned a T-shirtindustry, with at least three commemorative logos marketed.</TEXT></DOC>
