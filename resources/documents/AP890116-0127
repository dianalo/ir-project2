All three could have been sentenced to death. They turned towardsupporters in the gallery at the Pretoria Supreme Court and gaveclenched-fist salutes before they were led away.   A 20-year sentence for treason was issued to the most prominentdefendant, Ebrahim Ismail Ebrahim, 51, who was abducted fromSwaziland in 1986 by men he said were South African agents.   Ebrahim, of Indian descent, has been widely described as thehighest-ranking official of the mainly black ANC to go on trialsince Nelson Mandela and several colleagues were given lifesentences in 1964. The ANC is the largest guerrilla group fightingthe white-dominated government.   One of Ebrahim's black co-defendants, Mandla Maseko, received a23-year sentence for treason. Simon Dladla, a Swazi citizen,received 12 years for terrorism. He could not be found guilty oftreason because he did not owe allegiance to South Africa.   Local newspapers said that after the supporters in the courtgallery finished singing an anti-apartheid anthem, a governmentprosecutor was heard saying, ``Long live the AWB'' _ the Afrikaansinitials of the white-supremacist Afrikaner Resistance Movement.   The three were found guilty in November of laying land mines thatinjured eight people in Transvaal Province in 1986. At one stage ofthe 16-month trial, three members of the ANC's executive committee _who faced arrest in South Africa _ gave evidence for the defense ata court session held last year in London.   Ebrahim, along with his co-defendants, did not testify during thetrial, but he submitted a 17-page written statement to the court inwhich he alleged that all three men were tortured by police.   ``Finding us guilty is merely a statement that the stateconsiders the struggle for democracy, equality, justice, peace and anon-racial society to be morally and politically reprehensible,'' hesaid.   ``We wish to say to our people, we tried to carry out yourbehests,'' Ebrahim wrote. ``We did our best to live up to what youexpected of us as members of the African National Congress.''   In an editorial Monday, the country's largest Afrikaans-languagedaily newspaper, Beeld, suggested that the government open talkswith the ANC. Beeld, traditionally supportive of the government,said South Africa could reap immense benefits by freeing Mandela andnegotiating with his organization.   President P.W. Botha, who has criticized Beeld's increasinglyliberal editorial stance in recent months, has rejected any talkswith the ANC until it renounces violence.   The ANC was outlawed by South Africa's white authorities in 1960and a year later began a bombing and sabotage campaign. Theorganization is multiracial but overwhelmingly black.   Ebrahim, who holds an Indian passport, left South Africa in 1979after completing a 15-year prison term for sabotage.   South African authorities say Ebrahim at one time was thecompanion of Helene Passtoors, a Dutch-Belgian citizen convicted inMay 1986 of treason against South Africa.   Ms. Passtoors, who is serving a 10-year sentence, is the ex-wifeof Klaas De Jonge, a Dutchman who holed up in the Dutch Embassy inPretoria for two years rather than face charges of smuggling armsfor the ANC. He returned to Holland in 1987 as part of a prisonerexchange.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
