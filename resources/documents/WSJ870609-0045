MillerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> PNPTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)RETAILING (RET) </IN><TEXT>   Pay 'N Pak Stores Inc., rejecting a competing offer from a Florida investor, said it agreed to a leveraged buyout valued at about $212.5 million from a group that includes senior management.    The Kent, Wash.-based retailer of home improvement products said shareholders would receive $17 for each of their shares, plus preferred stock valued by the company at $4.25; the newly issued preferred will pay a 17% annual dividend.    The offer initially appeared to end investor Paul Bilzerian's takeover bid, but Mr. Bilzerian said late yesterday that he &quot;probably&quot; would top the offer. He also angrily complained he wasn't kept informed of the latest bid.    The management group's buyout proposal is structured as a tender offer for 81% of the company's approximately 10 million common shares outstanding.    If all common shares are tendered, the company said, the group will pay cash for holders' shares on a pro-rata basis. The remainder would subsequently be swapped for the preferred in a second-step transaction after the group has control of the company.    Pay 'N Pak said the proposal is conditioned on at least two-thirds of the company's shares being tendered.    The company's statement didn't say what stake the management group, which includes Chairman David J. Heerensperger, currently controls, nor did it indicate when the offer would begin. Pay 'N Pak officials didn't return phone calls yesterday.    Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd., New York, is arranging financing for the cash portion of the transaction.    Pay 'N Pak said its board voted unanimously to approve the leveraged buyout after a special committee of independent directors recommended it, and financial advisor Salomon Brothers Inc. gave it a positive fairness opinion.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Pay 'N Pak shares closed at $20.625, up 50 cents.    If Mr. Bilzerian dropped his buyout effort, he could make a sizable profit on the approximately one million shares he currently holds.    As previously reported, Pay 'N Pak shares were trading at just over $13 before Mr. Bilzerian disclosed his initial interest in a March filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    Mr. Bilzerian's original $19-a-share, all-cash proposal was rebuffed as inadequate in April by the company's board. His latest proposal, made after he signed a standstill agreement in exchange for a look at non-public company information, offered $17 in cash plus $4 in preferred. He and the management group have been bidding against each other for about a week.    In an interview, Mr. Bilzerian said that despite his request to be kept informed of any higher offers so he could respond, Salomon informed him shortly after his bid expired that a better offer had been obtained. He also said the investment bankers refused to tell him what the better offer was.    Noting that his offer wasn't a hostile one, Mr. Bilzerian called Salomon's behavior unethical and &quot;irresponsible.&quot; Salomon officials couldn't be reached for comment.    Mr. Bilzerian said he will &quot;probably&quot; make an offer to top that of the management group, and will announce his decision within a few days.    &quot;If we decide to go higher, then we will certainly litigate&quot; yesterday's agreement, he said.    &quot;All of the statements we've made about our confidence in management you can trash. I couldn't throw them out fast enough,&quot; he added angrily.    Pay 'N Pak said the buyout agreement calls for the management group to receive a cancellation fee of $6 million in the event the company accepts a higher bid, or if a third party acquires 30% or more of the company's shares outstanding.    The group is also to receive &quot;reasonable&quot; out-of-pocket expenses and fees as much as $3.5 million in conjunction with the transaction. </TEXT></DOC>
