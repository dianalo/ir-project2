 An electrical engineer byprofession, he's also a self-described hacker and tinkerer at home.andP;  He hasowned, at one time or another, a wide variety of personal computers.andO;Eschewing an attachment to any particular PC, Carroll's priority is checkingout what's new.andP;  &quot;I'm one of those guys who has to have every new thing thatcomes along,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Even if it's used.&quot;andM;Used PC equipment?andP;  In an industry that works double-time to churn out thelatest, the greatest, the fastest, and the baddest, hand-me-down equipmentseems a rebel thought.andM;But to Carroll and plenty of other PC consumers, recycling desktop computersmakes perfect sense.andP;  And, as big companies shed their venerable, classic PCsin favor of the newest 386 screamers, a fresh supply of used equipment ishitting the secondhand circuit and being scooped up by individual users andsmall businesses.andP;  In 1988, used-PC vendors and brokers rang up $1.4 billionin sales.andP;  They expect to top that figure this year.andM;The used-PC marketplace, or the &quot;secondary market,&quot; as its vendors prefer tocall it, is quirky and unpredictable.andP;  Buyers who peruse the aisles of asecondhand store might spot a mint-condition IBM PC AT 339 for $2,000 one dayand little more than no-name clones and CP/M remnants the next.andP;  But they'llalso find sellers who work at least as hard as new equipment vendors to keeptheir shelves well stocked--and their customers coming back.andM;Thrill ShoppingandM;One thing that draws buyers to used-PC stores is that quintessential shoppinghigh: a bargain.andP;  The sight of a $450 price tag on a NEC MultiSync II monitoris enough to turn many a PC lover's knees to jelly.andM;But for another and equally large group of customers, eyeing discountedmonitors, printers, and modems is less a visceral experience than one born ofnecessity.andP;  Without the opportunity to buy seasoned PC equipment, plenty ofconsumers would find themselves shut out of desktop computing.andM;A lesser known reason for browsing the aisles for used computer equipment issimply that there's no good reason not to.andP;  A PC is an intricate masterpieceof electronics.andP;  Bad chips generally fail within the first few hours ofoperation, not several years after the motherboard rolls off the assemblyline.andP;  And although a PC's moving parts--the disk drives and keyboard--areprone to mechanical failure, they're more easily and inexpensively replacedthan its electronic innards.andM;In short, a used PC is seasoned.andP;  Someone else has already worked out thekinks.andM;Roller Coaster PricingandM;The seductive prices on used PC equipment can prove fickle.andP;  Prices forsecondhand PCs are based on demand for the type of unit, its age, and thecurrent market conditions, which can soar and dip on an almost weekly basis.andO;Between September and December 1988, the IBM PC AT, usually the blue-chipstock of the secondary market, lost $800 in value, according to the pricingindex of the Boston Computer Exchange, a broker of used equipment.andP;  Prices onused PCs can also plummet after a company announces discontinuation of aproduct or the introduction of a new line.andM;Resale prices also vary from place to place.andP;  Boulder, Colorado, for example,has been saturated with Telvideo equipment ever since a local distributorclosed its doors and auctioned off its inventory.andP;  &quot;You can't give aTelevideo away here, because everyone already has one,&quot; says Ed Owens, ownerof Micro-Seconds, which runs used-PC stores in Boulder and Denver.andP;  &quot;But takethem to California, and they'll sell quite well.&quot;andP;  Conversely, studentdiscounts in the San Francisco area depressed Macintosh resale values toaround $ 500, even though the Mac fetches nearly twice that in Denver.andM;Apple's Macintosh and any equipment by IBM and Compaq are the jewels of theused-goods marketplace.andP;  They're the systems everyone asks for, and they holdtheir high resale value for years.andP;  Name brand cachet means everything in theused marketplace.andP;  Trailing behind the three leaders are systems by suchcompanies as Epson and Tandy, manufacturers whose names, though not quiteasesteemed among buyers of used computers, are at least recognized byconsumers.andM;Generic PC clones inhabit the lowly and distant third tier of the usedmarketplace.andP;  Even those which have been upgraded to the hilt carry almost novalue as used equipment, a fact that consumers who buy them new shouldconsider.andP;  &quot;Anyone who's buying a computer should anticipate selling it,&quot;says Alexander Randall, president of the Boston Computer Exchange.andP;  &quot;It's amistake to buy a bare-bones system and then build it up.andP;  If you buy an ATsystem and then add [no-name] boards, drives, etc., the only thing there thathas any value in the secondary market is the shell.&quot;andM;Name brand equipment holds its value even as it passes into the hands ofthird- and fourth-generation owners.andP;  A good example is an IBM Model 30, saysStephen Gold, president of Computer Renaissance, a Pittsburgh-based chain ofused-PC stores.andP;  With a printer and some software, the new Model 30 sells forabout $1,500.andP;  &quot;You go to sell that in one year,&quot; Gold estimates, &quot;and youget $1,200 back.andP;  It cost you $300 to operate it for one year.&quot;andP;  The annualoperating costs for a $1,000 compatible are much higher.andP;  &quot;You go to sellthat in one year and you get only $500 for it.andP;  It cost you $500 to operatethe compatible for one year.&quot;andM;Service and SupportandM;Still not convinced that getting a used PC is a legitimate alternative tobuying a new one?andP;  You're not alone.andP;  It can be hard to resist slick magazineads peddling the latest models of swift, stylish PCs.andP;  The used-PCmarketplace, in contrast, has a chaotic, homegrown feel that worriespotential customers.andP;  &quot;The major worry that any buyer has is that he's goingto get the thing home and it won't work,&quot; says Randall.andP;  Potential buyersalso worry that cables and connectors will be missing or that the product hasbeen misrepresented--that the model they thought was an AT is actually an XT.andM;Other would-be customers find it difficult to express their doubts.andP;  &quot;There'ssomething that nags at them [about buying used], and they just don't knowwhat is is,&quot; says R. Doug Lewis, president of Micro Trade Mart, aHouston-based seller of used PC equipment.andM;To soothe buyers' worries, used-PC vendors offer amenities that rival thoseof retail stores.andP;  For starters, they work hard to look like first-runstores.andP;  The used-PC storefront may lack the spit-shine finish of retailchain operations, but many offer similar hardware and software displays andaisles of products to meander down.andM;Most also support and service the products they sell.andP;  MicroSeconds, ofBoulder, employs authorized IBM, Compaq, and Apple technicians and honors30-day parts and labor guarantees on all products it sells.andP;  In eight yearsof business, says owner Owens, only a handful of systems have come back.andP;  InHouston, the Micro Trade Mart also offers a 30-day warranty on parts andlabor and provides regular service for the used IBMs, Compaqs, Commodores,Ataris, and Apples that fill its 3,000-square-foot store.andM;&quot;The difference between a new and used PC should be the warranty, but wewarranty them and so remove that obstacle,&quot; says Computer Renaissance's Gold.andO;&quot;Your're guaranteed not to buy someone else's headache.&quot;andM;Rolling out the Welcome MatandM;Secondhand-PC shops add one more wrinkle to service: they target the littleguys, the much-overlooked individuals and small companies.andP;  Retail sellers ofnew equipment usually prefer the more lucrative accounts of larger companies,and mail order buying often intimidates PC neophytes.andM;The one-two punch of affordable prices and decent service offered byused-equipment sellers often proves irresistible for budget-conscious localbusinesses that may need only one or two systems and a financial softwarepackage.andP;  As a result, purchases by small businesses now account for nearlyhalf of the sales of used PCs, and old models deemed out of favor on the fasttrack now hum contentedly at countless small companies.andM;One example is the P. C. McKenzie Company, of Pittsburgh, a manufacturers'sales representative company that decided to automate its sales operationslast year.andP;  After 40 years of meticulously handtyping each detailed pricequote, some of which stretched to ten pages, McKenzie was ready to enter theage of electronic spreadsheets and print commands.andM;Vice president and treasurer Mark W. Good shopped in the retail stores first,looking for equipment that was reputable and economically priced.andP;  He cameaway empty-handed.andP;  &quot;We had to ask ourselves if we really wanted to dump thatmuch money into computers,&quot; says Good.andP;  Even worse, the sound advice he hadhoped for was nowhere to be found.andP;  &quot;We didn't have the time to go throughand learn everything there was to know about computers.andP;  We needed somebodyto analyze what we were doing and make an intelligent suggestion.&quot;andM;Good found what he needed in the secondhand market.andP;  For $1,395, he snagged aused ATandamp;T 6300 and a panasonic 109li printer.andP;  At the store's suggestion, hebought a new package of Microsoft Works to calculate and format the office'sprice quotations.andM;Home on the Nonprofit RangeandM;Nonprofit businesses, perpetually strapped for cash, represent anotherfertile home for used PCs.andP;  &quot;The last thing a nonprofit wants to do is spenda lot of money on new equipment,&quot; says Betsy Adams, executive director of theMount Hope Day Care Center, in Providence, Rhode Island.andP;  Plus, she adds, &quot;Wedon't need state-of-the-art stuff.&quot;andM;But after 18 months of working on a donated IBM Displaywriter with 8-inchfloppy disks, Adams decided she did need to be at least within shoutingdistance of the technology leaders.andP;  So last fall she dropped $1,250 on aused Macintosh 512 with MacPaint, MacWrite, and Lotus's Jazz.andP;  (The samesystem is now priced at around $850, used.)andM;Like Adams, Mike Rachlin is reluctant to spend his nonprofit employer's tightresources on expensive, first-run PS/2s.andP;  Rachlin, the data processingmanager for the Mystic Seaport Museum, in Mystic, Connecticut, has patientlyshopped the secondhand circuit for surplus parts he'll eventually assembleinto complete system and use to help catalog the museum's 1 millionphotographs and 300,000 objects.andP;  Picking up used PS/2 boxes for as little as$1,100 and motherboards for $800, Rachlin estimates that he spent 30 percentless than he would have if he had bouthg the systems new.andM;The DrawbacksandM;The used-pc market is not without glitches.andP;  Computer equipment, new or used,is never worry-free.andM;Consultant Cam Marshall, of Boulder, has twice had to return a used system hepurchased.andP;  Despite bearing a striking resemblance to a 10MB XT, the systemMarshall bought was billed as having a 20MB hard drive.andP;  He questioned thesalesperson but was assured that the larger capacity drive was inside.andP;  Athome he discover it did indeed store only 10MB.andP;  Worse, the system'sreconditioned Seagate hard drive died shortly after Marshall booted it up.andM;In both cases, the vendor quickly rectified matters and replaced the units,and Marshall continued to be a big fan of buying secondhand equipment.andM;With a fresh crop of superfast 386s now on the market, general befuddlementover OS/2, and whispers that the 80486 is just around the corner, it's nowonder that many consumers are a little gun-shy about new PC equipment.andP;  Forthose who feel uneasy in today's Casbah-like PC market, a used PC just mightbe the start of a beautiful friendship.andM;The Computer Blue BookandM;Need a reliable guide to what the PC on the desk or the used PC you've beeneyeing is worth?andP;  The Computer Blue Book lets you determine the value of PCequipment, in the same way the classic blue book lets you estimate the worthof a car.andM;Published twice a year by the National Association of Computer Dealers, theComputer Blue Book contains information about more than 15,000 hardware andsoftware products for all kinds of personal computers, from CP/M machines toPS/2s.andP;  Each entry contains the list price, the general market price for fourregions of the country, and the price the equipment carries in the usedmarket.andM;You can buy this resource in bookstores for $12.95, but it can be tough tofind.andP;  The easiest and surest way to get a copy is through the NationalAssociation of Computer Dealers (NACD).andP;  For $15.95, a one-year subscriptionto the Computer Blue Bokk guarantees you a copy of both editions of thebiannual guide.andM;The NACD also lends a hand to buyers who wonder if the deal they're about toget on a used PC is too good to be true.andP;  The organization operates atoll-free hotline that lets computer owners register their equipment as asecurity precaution.andP;  Potential buyers can call the hotline and punch in theserial numbers of equipment they're considering buying to find out how tocontact the registered owner.andP;  The hotline database includes more than 8,000disk drives, monitors, keyboards, and modems.andM;What if a caller suspects the equipment may be stolen?andP;  &quot;The user can buy theequipment at his own risk,&quot; says NACD executive director Ray Davis, or takethe suggestion of the voice-operated phone system, which advises the buyer tocontact the previous registered owner instead of confronting the seller.andM;The National Association of Computer Dealers is based at 14925 MemorialDrive, Building A, Houston, Tex.andP;  77079-9979; 800-223-5264.andP;  The number forthe used-equipment hotline is 800-346-6223.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
