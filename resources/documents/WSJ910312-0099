Technology stocks led the plunge, tipped into a tailspinafter Merrill Lynch downgraded its investment ratings onInternational Business Machines and Intel. IBM dropped 2 1/8to 129 1/8 and Intel plummeted 5 3/4 to 45 3/4.</LP><TEXT>   James Solloway, director of research at Argus Research,said the market may have anticipated an economic recovery toosoon.   Economic indicators released last week, including Friday'sFebruary employment report, don't show that an economicturnaround is imminent, he said. The nation's unemploymentrate climbed to 6.5% last month, its highest rate since 1987.   &quot;The data suggest that there's still some life left inthis recession, which will have a negative effect onearnings,&quot; Mr. Solloway added.   Traders said the market traded largely on technicalfactors, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced off a&quot;support level&quot; at 2950 three times before piercing thatlevel at around 2 p.m. EST.   The industrial average ended down 15.84 points at 2939.36.Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index lost 1.99 to 372.96, theNew York Stock Exchange Composite Index slipped 0.91 to204.04 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell 1.99 to347.40.   Declining stocks totaled 935 and advancers 649. Big Boardtrading volume fell to 161,600,000 shares from 206,850,000Friday.   Several analysts have warned for weeks that the headyadvance of January and February could lead to a letdown inMarch as weak outlooks for first-quarter corporate earningsbegin to appear.   Merrill Lynch analyst Daniel Mandresh was the first tofire such a salvo yesterday morning, lowering his profitestimates for IBM's first quarter to $1.75 a share from the$1.82 estimated earlier. IBM earned $1.81 a share in thequarter last year, meaning Mr. Mandresh now expects thecomputer maker to earn less, not more, in the quarter than ayear ago.   With the industrial average having tried again and failedto close above the 3000 level, the market may be even morevulnerable to such forecast revisions.   However, Eric Miller, chief investment officer atDonaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette, said there is little reason tobe concerned about the market.   &quot;This is just a case of the Monday doldrums,&quot; he said ofthe market drop. &quot;At this stage I wouldn't be inclined toread anything more into it.&quot;   If the market flounders for the rest of the week, however,Mr. Miller said he will take another look.   Argus Research's Mr. Solloway, however, says near-termgains may be limited.   &quot;There's very little upside potential here,&quot; said Mr.Solloway. He noted that the Sandamp;P 500 is trading at about 17.5times trailing 12-month earnings, which he says is prettyhigh in the absence of any signs of strong economic growth.   The market has chosen to ignore the drop in interestrates. The Treasury's long bond rose nearly a pointyesterday, sending the yield down. The Federal Reserve iswidely believed to have eased short-term rates, targeting 6%as the level at which banks should lend money to each otherovernight.   Unisys led the most-active list, dropping 1/4 to 6 onvolume of more than 5.7 million shares. The computer maker'sstock climbed about 56% last week. The company is expected tosell assets sometime this year to pay down debt, but thereare no indications that a sale is imminent.   Other stocks in the technology sector took a beating.Digital Equipment dropped 2 1/2 to 79, Motorola lost 2 3/8 to61 3/4 and Conner Peripherals fell 3/4 to 26 1/2.   RJR Nabisco's when-issued shares dropped 3/4 to 10 onvolume of nearly 4.7 million shares. It was only the secondsession in which the stock has dropped since it began tradingFeb. 1.   CBS fell 12 3/8 to 169 1/2. Several analysts made negativecomments on the stock yesterday morning, citing a pendingFederal Communications Commission ruling that could restrictthe ability of networks to sell or syndicate televisionreruns. Capital Cities/ABC fell 12 to 468.   General Electric, which owns NBC, gained 1 5/8 to 68 3/8.   Boeing lost 1 1/8 to 48 3/8. Jet deliveries may fallsharply in coming years, according to yesterday's Heard OnThe Street column in this newspaper.   Rohr Industries market planning director John Walsh toldthe Journal that there is plenty of potential for postponingorders. Rohr, which supplies aircraft engine housings toBoeing and others, dropped 5/8 to 17 1/4. McDonnell Douglasended unchanged at 40 1/2.   Gap Inc. fell 2 5/8 to 46 7/8 after Goldman Sachs crosseda one million-share block of the company's stock in what wasrumored to be apparent profit-taking by a company insider.   Commonwealth Edison added 1/2 to 39 1/2. Standard andamp; Poor'supgraded its rating on the utility's debt following a ratedecision by the Illinois Commerce Commission that wasfavorable to the company.   SafeCard Services slid 1 1/2 to 7 7/8. A grand jury probeis reviewing evidence against SafeCard's founder and formerchairman, Peter Halmos, and his brother, Steven Halmos,according to this week's Barron's. A contract thatrepresented 38% of the company's revenue last year might becanceled if either of the Halmos' cease to manage SafeCard'sbusiness. Barron's also noted that the brothers sold nearly100,000 SafeCard shares early this year, and have filed withthe Securities and Exchange Commission to dispose of as manyas 5.9 million more that may be acquired through the exerciseof options.   Sears Roebuck added 1/2 to 32 1/2. UBS Securities analystPeter Siris told Barron's there's substantial upsidepotential for the stock and limited downside risk.   NCR dropped 2 1/4 to 96. American Telephone andamp; Telegraphsaid it is prepared to raise its $90-a-share bid for NCR to$100, but isn't doing so because NCR has balked at engagingin merger talks.   Oppenheimer Capital rose 1/8 to 18 3/4. The limitedpartnership declared a 40.8-cent special dividend, and filedfor the offering of 4.2 million limited partnership units.   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 1.45to 354.86.</TEXT></DOC>
