At O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, the nation's busiest,only two runways were open Monday and United Airlines, O'Hare'sheaviest user, canceled most outbound flights after 5 p.m. and anadditional 165 flights this morning.   Nearly 50,000 passengers were stranded at O'Hare on the day afterChristmas, one of the busiest travel days of the year.   Milwaukee's Mitchell International Airport was closed for twohours Monday so crews could clear snow off runways. About 25 flightswere delayed, airport spokeswoman Patricia Rowe said.   Warmer air moved into some areas today, but cold air dominatedthe northern and central Intermountain area. Ely, Nev., registered20 degrees below zero and had a wind-chill reading of 55 below zerothis morning.   The early winter storm Monday dropped up to a foot of snow,closing interstates in five states.   ``I was stuck last year on Christmas Eve at the airport, so Ithought this year I'd take the bus. Wrong!'' said Jan Gabrielson ofCincinnati, who spent several hours at Chicago's Greyhound busterminal while returning from a Christmas trip to Iowa.   In Utah, the heavy snow caused the collapse of a department storeroof south of Salt Lake City. No injuries were reported, sincemanagers of the Fred Meyer store denied entry to customers when theyarrived Monday morning and found the roof sagging and creaking from6-foot-high snow drifts. It collapsed soon afterward.   ``Luckily they didn't open the store or we would have had a majorcatastrophe,'' said Salt Lake County Fire Department Capt. Max Berry.   In Indiana, the winter weather caused a tractor-trailer tojackknife on Interstate 69, triggering a 42-car pileup that left oneperson dead and 23 injured. An unrelated 35-car pileup on thehighway injured eight people.   Altogether, five people died in Indiana traffic accidents blamedon the storm. Also Monday, Illinois and Minnesota each reported onestorm-related traffic death. Three people died on roads in Wisconsin.   Farmers welcomed the storm in North Dakota, which like much ofthe region had suffered a severe drought. Up to 11 inches fell onparts of the state.   ``It's good news,'' said wheat farmer Peter Silbernagel ofLinton, N.D. ``It greatly improves the outlook for spring planting.''   The snow dissipated today as warmer air brought showers andthunderstorms to parts of the central Plains and Mississippi Valley,said Dan McCarthy, a meteorologist with the National WeatherService's Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City, Mo.   ``The main storm system is going to move slowly off into Ontariotoday, with some lingering snow across Minnesota,'' McCarthy said.   Nonetheless, temperatures early today were in the single digitsand below zero from the northern Plains through the northernRockies, and some winter storm warnings continued this morning.   Northerly winds increasing to 20 to 35 mph there were expected tocreate dangerous wind chills of minus 50.   On Monday, snow and freezing rain fell from the Rockies and upperPlains to Ohio. Accidents and blowing snow closed segments ofinterstate highways in Utah, Minnesota, Indiana, Arizona and SouthDakota. The highest accumulations were 12 inches around Chicago andin Bemidji, Minn.   In South Dakota, which received up to 10 inches of snow, thestorm knocked out power to about 55,000 customers of Northern StatesPower Co. on Monday afternoon when high winds caused icy power linesto bang together and short-circuit, said John Lockhart, thecompany's construction manager.   In Durango, Colo., two men were hospitalized in good conditionMonday after being buried under snow for nearly seven hours. Theywere rescued by passersby who heard their screams. The area wasunder an avalanche warning.   More than 100 slides were reported in Colorado's high country byMonday, according to the Avalanche Information Center in Denver.</TEXT></DOC>
