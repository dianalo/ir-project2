To the south, in Yellowstone National Park,wildfires driven by strong wind threatened to close more roads.   In eastern Idaho, shifting winds pushed flames through controllines and toward ranches and grain fields. Firefighters alsobattled blazes blackening forests and fields in Washington,California and Utah.   But there was a glimmer of hope amid the continuing struggles tocontain the wildfires: U.S. Forest Service officials said they havefilled hundreds of temporary firefighting positions and had to turnaway volunteers. Only Wyoming now needs more help, they said.   ``We really appreciate the public concern and willingness tohelp in this firefighting effort,'' said Tom Quinn, Rocky Mountainregional director of fire management. ``Response was positive andrapid.''   In Montana, 300 firefighters outside the Scapegoat Wildernessarea tried to keep flames that spread out from the reserve fromburning more private property.   ``It's not something you can turn your back on because it'sright there,'' said Barbara Krause, whose ranch is only a couple ofmiles from the fire.   Gov. Ted Schwinden on Wednesday urged Montanans to stay out ofthe forests during the Labor Day weekend. The state Fish and GameCommission voted to delay for two weeks the opening of the 1988hunting season.   ``We simply don't need any more fires at this point,'' Schwindentold reporters at a hastily called news conference. ``It's not justsimply a matter of the cost of putting out the fires; it is that weare pushing our manpower and equipment resources to the limit.''   He said 5,000 firefighters are battling blazes on 208,000 acresin Montana. An additional 173,000 acres were burned in earlierfires.   The Oregon Department of Forestry also put forest lands offlimits Wednesday, announcing that 3.8 million acres in the easternpart of the state will be closed to the public for the Labor Dayweekend and until further notice due to the extreme fire danger andlimited resources to fight new fires.   In Yellowstone, 4,000 men and women are fighting fires that havescorched nearly 524,000 acres, about 23 percent of the park's 2.2million acres, according to the park's chief naturalist GeorgeRobinson.   Windy conditions that ended several days of calm weather playedhavoc with efforts to control the 231,000-acre Clover-Mist fire,burning in Yellowstone and neighboring Shoshone National Forest.   ``It's an emotional roller coaster,'' said Steve Fuller, anemployee of a park concessionaire. ``One minute the fire lays downand looks harmless and then the next day, it gets up and comes atus.''   The park's south entrance remained closed Wednesday, andofficials closed a road between North Junction and Canyon, two parkvillages. They hope to reopen the south entrance Thursday for thefirst time in about two weeks, meaning all five gates will be open.   Another blaze, the North Fork fire, burned within two miles ofWest Yellowstone, Mont., but fire officials assured nervousresidents that the flames would not reach the town. About 1,000firefighters constructed lines and removed vegetation and otherburnable material from the edge of the town, said fire informationofficer Bill Pidanick.   ``The conditions are a heck of a lot better than they wereyesterday,'' he said. ``We don't have the wind.''   Driven by high winds, the 92,600-acre fire burst out of controlTuesday afternoon, jumping the Madison River and the main road fromthe park's west entrance to Madison Junction. A flareup Wednesdayclosed Yellowstone's west entrance for several hours in theafternoon.   In Idaho, a pair of strike crews and four bulldozers Wednesdayprotected the Star Valley area of eastern Idaho from the ragingTrail Creek fire. National Guard jets surveyed fires.   ``The majority of the ranches are on alert,'' said Dan Pugmire,spokesman for Caribou National Forest in eastern Idaho. ``But wedidn't have to alert them. They were all standing outside watchingit.''   Pugmire said winds shifted with amazing speed.   ``The winds were going one direction and we had a blowout on thenortheastern flank,'' he said. ``Then the wind shifted 180 degreesand the fire turned back on its self and began running east. ...There's going to be some spots that are going to grow on us beforewe get a handle on it.''   The Trail Creek fire southwest of Palisades Reservoir was themost threatening of 17 major blazes raging across Idaho and up intothe Panhandle National Forest. More than 2,500 firefighters backedup by National Guard personnel and equipment battled the worst ofthe blazes that have burned more than 70,000 acres of forest andrange lands in Idaho.   California firefighters got a break Wednesday from Mother Nature.   There were only 243 lightning strikes Tuesday night, comparedwith nearly 9,500 the day before, said Karen Terrill, a spokeswomanfor the California Forestry Department.   By Wednesday morning, firefighters contained most of the morethan 100 brush and timber fires started by lightning Monday andearly Tuesday, officials said.   But two new fires flared in the Sierra National Forest, onecalled the Garnet Fire, over about 100 acres in the Kings RiverCanyon in the southern Sierra, and another near Mariposa justoutside Yosemite National Park.   The Mariposa blaze, which was sparked by children playing withmatches, destroyed at least one home and forced the evacuation of17 people as it grew to 250 acres, said state Forestry spokeswomanKary Weaver.   In Oregon, firefighters adopted a fall-back strategy against theTepee Butte fire, which has burned 35,775 acres of grass and timberon the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest and the Hell's CanyonNational Recreation Area.   The blaze will grow to 59,000 acres before it reaches fire linesbeing built by 679 firefighters, spokesman Ron DeHart said. ``Wecannot safely put crews up close to this fire'' because of theextremely rugged terrain and flash fuels, he said.   Utah firefighters controlled a 525-acre fire near northernUtah's Pineview Reservoir and a 100-acre brush fire in ButterfieldCanyon, and expect to control a 60-acre blaze in eastern Utah byThursday night.   In eastern Washington state, a brief respite from hot and dryweather allowed firefighters to gain ground on major fires burningin more than 23,000 acres of trees and brush.   But a warming trend is expected over the next few days. ``That'snot good,'' said Ron DeHart, a spokesman for the multiagency firecoordinating center in Portland, Ore.</TEXT></DOC>
