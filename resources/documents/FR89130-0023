It was publishedon February 21, 1986 (51 FR 6370-6371). The Executive Order establishedgovernmentwide effect for an agency's nonprocurement debarment or suspensionaction.Section 6 of the Executive Order directed the Office of Management andBudget (OMB) to issue guidelines governing implementation of the Order,and section 3 of the Executive Order directed the departments and agenciesto promulgate final rules, consistent with these guidelines. On May 26,1988, 27 agencies issued a final common rule (53 FR 19161-19211), consistentwith OMB's guidelines. The common preamble for that publication providesfull background for the promulgation of the Executive Order and the historyof the common rulemaking.This second common rulemaking includes the Department of Agriculture andvarious small Federal agencies which did not participate in the May 26,1988 publication. On October 20, 1987, the Department of Agriculture publisheda proposed rule, the same day as 24 of the 27 agencies which co-signedthe first common rulemaking. The Department of Agriculture and the 27 agenciesshared a common public docket.The other small Federal agencies which are participating in this secondcommon rule did not issue a prior proposed rule. These agencies have concludedthat publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary becausethe common rulemaking was subjected to extensive public scrutiny. OMB publishedproposed and final guidelines and 27 agencies issued proposed rules forcomments. Therefore, these agencies have decided, for good cause under5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), not to publish a proposed rulemaking and to join thegovernmentwide final common rule.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="69"><ITAG tagnum="84">Text of the Common Rule</ITAG>The text of the common rule as adopted by the agencies in this documentappears below.<ITAG tagnum="56">PART_GOVERNMENTWIDE DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION (NONPROCUREMENT)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.100 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.105 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.110 Coverage.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.115 Policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Effect of Action</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.200 Debarment or suspension.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.205 Ineligible persons.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.210 Voluntary exclusion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.215 Exception provision.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.220 Continuation of covered transactions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.225 Failure to adhere to restrictions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Debarment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.300 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.305 Causes for debarment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.310 Procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.311 Investigation and referral.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.312 Notice of proposed debarment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.313 Opportunity to contest proposed debarment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.314 Debarring official's decision.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.315 Settlement and voluntary exclusion.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.320 Period of debarment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.325 Scope of debarment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Suspension</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.400 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.405 Causes for suspension.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.410 Procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.411 Notice of suspension.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.412 Opportunity to contest suspension.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.413 Suspending official's decision.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.415 Period of suspension.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.420 Scope of suspension.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart E_Responsibilities of GSA, Agency and Participants</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.500 GSA responsibilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.505 [Agency] responsibilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"><T2>XX</T2>.510 Participants' responsibilities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="75">Appendix A to Part </ITAG><T2>XX</T2>_Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other ResponsibilityMatters_Primary Covered Transactions<ITAG tagnum="75">Appendix B to Part </ITAG><T2>XX</T2>_Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibilityand Voluntary Exclusion_Lower Tier Covered Transactions<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Executive Order 12549 (citation to Agency rulemakingauithority).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; _.100</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose.</ITAG>(a) Executive Order 12549 provides that, to the extent permitted by law,Executive departments and agencies shall participate in a governmentwidesystem for nonprocurement debarment and suspension.

For purposes of these regulationssuch transactions will be referred to as ``covered transactions.'' (1) <T3>Covered transaction. </T3>For purposes of these regulations, a coveredtransaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier covered transaction.Covered transactions at any tier need not involve the transfer of Federalfunds.

Violation of this restriction may resultin disallowance of costs, annulment or termination of award, issuance ofa stop work order, debarment or suspension, or other remedies, as appropriate.A participant may rely upon the certification of a prospective participantin a lower tier covered transaction that it and its principals are notdebarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the coveredtransaction (see Appendix B), unless it knows that the certification iserroneous.

On the same day, the Office of Management andBudget (OMB) published proposed guidelines on coverage, Governmentwidecriteria, and minimum due process procedures (51 FR 6372-6379). OMB issuedfinal guidelines on May 26, 1987, which were then published on May 29,1987 (52 FR 20360-20369). Section 3 of the E.O. 12549 required Executivedepartments and agencies to issue regulations implementing E.O. 12549 thatwere consistent with the OMB guidelines. On October 20, 1987, 20 Executive departments and agencies published aproposed common rule which implemented the final OMB guidelines (52 FR39035-39042). Instead of joining the proposed common rule, USDA publisheda proposed rule in Part 3015 that was consistent with the OMB guidelines.In the proposed regulation, USDA consolidated some of the provisions includedin the OMB guidelines and added USDA specific internal procedures. On May 26, 1988, 27 Executive departments and agencies published a finalcommon rule (53 FR 19159-19211). Upon reconsideration of the issue of joiningthe common rule, USDA is publishing this final rule which follows the textof the final common rule published on May 26, 1988. USDA's scope is limitedto domestic assistance transactions and USDA has added material to reflectgenerally internal organization and procedures, which was included in theUSDA October proposed rule. This final rule is published in newly createdPart 3017 in order to be consistent with the common rule format and numberingscheme.The comments received by USDA in response to its proposed rule were addressedin the preamble to the final common rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Additional Provisions </ITAG><T3>Definition of agency. </T3>USDA has amended the definition of ``agency''in andSection; 3017.105 of the common rule by adding paragraph (c)(1). USDAhas a decentralized nonprocurement debarment and suspension system.

The debarring and suspendingofficials will be at the Under Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or agencyhead levels in USDA.
