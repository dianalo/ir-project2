While FBI agents executed search warrants to look for evidence offraud, 80 staffers from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. beganthe work of liquidating the bank and preparing checks for federallyinsured depositors, federal authorities said.   In a related action, the Government National Mortgage Associationousted New York Guardian Mortgagee Corp. from GNMA's program ofmortgage-backed securities.   Louis Gasper, executive vice president of GNMA, said his agencydeclared the New York Guardian in default and took over itsmultibillion-dollar portfolio because investors were not being fullypaid.   Gasper said beginning next month investors will be paid in fulland on time and those shortchanged in the past would be reimbursed.   ``We believe there will be substantial losses that the governmentwill have to make up here and we will do so promptly,'' he said.   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said investigators obtained searchwarrants based on allegations of self-dealing and misuse of bankresources. They cited transactions made by Louis B. Bernstein,president of New York Guardian and the largest shareholder ofGuardian Bank.   Maloney said that among the allegations was that Bernstein wasinvolved in a sham divestiture in which $5.4 million was improperlytransferred from New York Guardian to Mebco Bank of Geneva. TheSwiss bank than lent $5 million to LBB Co., a company owned byBernstein, and LBB bought New York Guardian and another GuardianBank subsidiary, Guardian Diversified Services Inc., for $1 million.   Alan Whitney, spokesman for the FDIC, said an announcement wouldbe made in a few days about when checks covering insured depositswould be issued to the bank's 12,000 depositors.   All deposits are insured by the government up to $100,000.Customers with accounts of more than $100,000 will receive $100,000and a certificate for the balance that represents a claim againstwhatever assets remain after the bank liquidation, Whitney said.   The bank was declared insolvent by Dean S. Marriott, seniordeputy comptroller of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.   Guardian Bank came under the scrutiny of the comptroller's officein 1984 because of what the government described as deterioratingasset quality, poor earnings and declining capital.   Despite prodding to correct the problems, the losses continuedand the bank went under with assets of $420 million and deposits of$390 million, Maloney said.   Guardian Bank was founded in 1973 as Vanguard National Bank, aminority-owned company. Other stockholders took control in a proxyfight in 1976 and in 1979 Bernstein bought the bank, merged it withhis mortgage company and changed its name.</TEXT></DOC>
