Ass'n </T3>v. <T3>Mathews, </T3>543 F.2d 284, 286-287 (D.C. Cir. 1976), the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit explained the purposeof this legislation:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Color Additive Amendments of 1960 reflect a Congressional andadministrative response to the need in contemporary society for a scientificallyand administratively sound basis for determining the safety of artificialcolor additives, widely used for coloring food, drugs, and cosmetics. TheAmendments reflect a general unwillingness to allow widespread use of suchproducts in the absence of scientific information on the effect of theseproducts on the human body. The previously used system had some glaringdeficiencies, and the 1960 Amendments were designed to overcome them. ** *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Footnotes omitted)</ITAG>As amended, section 706(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act(the act) (21 U.S.C. 376(a)) provides that a color additive will be deemedunsafe for use in food, drugs, cosmetics, and some medical devices unlessFDA has issued a regulation permanently listing that color additive forits intended use. FDA will issue such a regulation only if it has beenpresented with data that establish with reasonable certainty that no harmwill result from the use of the color additive. The burden of presentingsuch data is on the person who is seeking approval of the use of the additive.In passing the amendments, Congress provided for the provisional listingof the color additives in use at that time, pending completion of the scientificinvestigations needed for a determination about the safety of these additives(section 203(b) of the transitional provisions of the amendments, TitleII, Pub. L. 86-618, 74 Stat. 404-407 (21 U.S.C. 376, note)). Section 81.1(21 CFR 81.1) of the agency's color additive regulations enumerates thosecolor additives that are still provisionally listed. Among them is Dandamp;CRed No. 33 for use in drugs and cosmetics.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Regulatory History</ITAG>A. The Color AdditiveDandamp;C Red No. 33, a dull bluish red dye of the monoazo class, is identifiedin <T3>Chemical Abstracts </T3>as the disodium salt of 5-amino-4-hydroxy-3-(phenylazo)-2,7-naphthalenedisulfonicacid (CAS Reg. No. 3567-66-6). It is indentified in andSection; 82.1333 (21CFR 82.1333) as the disodium salt of 8-amino-2-phenylazo-1-naphtol-3,6-disulfonicacid. Other names include Colour Index Food Red 12 (C.I. No. 17200), C.I.Acid Red 33, Fast Acid Magenta B, and Acid Fuchsin D.In manufacturing the additive, the product obtained from the nitrous aciddiazotization of aniline is coupled with 4-hydroxy-5-amino-2,7-naphthalenedisulfonicacid in a alkaline aqueous medium. Dandamp;C Red No. 33 is soluble in waterand glycerol and slightly soluble in methanol and ethanol.Dandamp;C Red No. 33 is used in ingested drug preparations and in cosmeticssubject to ingestion, such as lipsticks, dentifrices, mouthwashes, andbreath fresheners. It is also used in externally applied cosmetics suchas noncoloring hair preparations, skin care, fragrance, and make-up products.The color additive Dandamp;C Red No. 33 has been in use for many years. BecauseDandamp;C Red No. 33 was in use at the time the Color Additive Amendmentsof 1960 were enacted, it was provisionally listed for drug and cosmeticuse in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of October 12, 1960 (25 FR 9759).In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of October 12, 1960 (25 FR 9759), the agencyestablished temporary tolerances for the provisional listing of certaincolor additives, including Dandamp;C Red No. 33, for use in lipsticks, ingesteddrugs, and other products subject to ingestion, such as mouthwashes anddentifrices. The original temporary tolerances, based on preliminary usageinformation and toxicity data available at that time, were intended tolimit use of the color additive to safe levels until all required toxicitytests were completed. The agency has revised the temporary tolerances overthe years as additional data became available, the lastest revision beingon August 21, 1979 (44 FR 48964). Dandamp;C Red No. 33 usage is limited underthe temporary tolerances in 21 CFR 81.25 to 3.0 percent by weight in lipcosmetics, to 0.75 milligram (mg) per daily dose of drugs, and to amountsconsistent with current good manufacturing practice in mouthwashes anddentifrices.Between 1960 and February 4, 1977, FDA postponed the closing date for theprovisional listing of Dandamp;C Red No. 33 several times. The agency grantedthese postponements in response to requests for additional time to completethe scientific investigations necessary for listing the color additiveunder section 706 of the act.B. Color Additive PetitionsIn the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of November 20, 1968 (33 FR 17205), FDA announcedthat a petition (CAP 8C0086) for the permanent listing of Dandamp;C Red No.33 as a color additive for use in ingested drugs, lipsticks, and externallyapplied drugs and cosmetics had been filed by the Toilet Goods Association,Inc. (now the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA)), thePharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA), and the Certified ColorIndustry Committee (now the Certified Color Manufacturers Association,Inc. (CCMA)), c/o Hazleton Laboratories, Inc., P.O. Box 30, Falls Church,VA 22046 (now 9200 Leesburg Turnpike, Vienna, VA 22180).The petition was filed under section 706 of the act (21 U.S.C. 376). Alater notice (41 FR 9584; March 5, 1976) amended the notice of filing ofthe petition to include the use of Dandamp;C Red No. 33 in all types of cosmeticssubject to ingestion and the additional use of Dandamp;C Red No. 33 in cosmeticsintended for use in the area of the eye.FDA notified the petitioners by letters dated May 14, 1976, August 15,1977, and August 4, 1978, of the need for data to support the use of Dandamp;CRed No. 33 in cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye. In a fourthletter, dated October 24, 1978, FDA advised the petitioners to considerwithdrawing the portion of the petition that sought approval of the useof Dandamp;C Red No. 33 in cosmetics intended for use in the area of theeye because it appeared that the required data from eye-area studies werenot readily available.The petitioners have not submitted the required data on eye-area use. Therefore,FDA considers that portion of the petition that relates to the listingof Dandamp;C Red No. 33 for eye-area use to be withdrawn without prejudicein accordance with the provisions of andSection; 71.4 (21 CFR 71.4). Useof Dandamp;C Red No. 33 in the area of the eye has never been covered bythe provisional listing of this color additive.The petitioners for CAP 8C0086 originally requested a regulation permittingup to 5.5 mg of Dandamp;C Red No. 33 per daily dose in ingested drugs, upto 3 percent of the color additive in cosmetics subject to ingestion, anduse in amounts consistent with current good manufacturing practice in othercosmetics and topically applied drugs.In February 1988, the petitioners amended their proposed tolerances torequest that use of Dandamp;C Red No. 33 be limited to 0.75 mg per dailydose in ingested drugs. These uses and limitations are the same as thecurrent uses and limitations under the provisional listing of this coloradditive.In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of August 6, 1973 (38 FR 21200), FDA announcedthat a petition (CAP 7C0059) for the permanent listing of Dandamp;C Red No.33 as a color additive for use in drugs and cosmetics for external applicationsalso had been filed by the Procter and Gamble Co., Toilet Goods Division,6000 Center Hill Rd., Cincinnati, OH 45224. The petition was filed undersection 706 of the act (21 U.S.C. 376).C. Toxicological Testing of Dandamp;C Red No. 33In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of February 4, 1977 (42 FR 6992), FDA publishedrevised regulations that required new chronic toxicity studies on 31 coloradditives, including Dandamp;C Red No. 33, as a condition for continued provisionallisting for ingested uses. FDA required the new toxicity studies becausethe earlier toxicity studies that the petitioners had submitted to supportthe safe use of these color additives were deficient in several respects.FDA described these deficiencies in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of September 23, 1976 (41 FR 41860);<ITAG tagnum="21">1. Many of the studies were conducted using groups of animals, i.e.,control and those fed the color additive, that are too small to permitconclusions to be drawn today on the chronic toxicity or carcinogenic potentialof the color. The small number of animals used does not, in and of itself,cause this result, but when considered together with the other deficienciesin this listing, does do so. By and large, the studies used 25 animalsin each group; today FDA recommends using at least 50 animals per group.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. In a number of the studies, the number of animals surviving toa meaningful age was inadequate to permit conclusions to be drawn todayon the chronic toxicity or carcinogenic potential of the color additivestested.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. In a number of the studies, an insufficient number of animals wasreviewed histologically.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. In a number of the studies, an insufficient number of tissues wasexamined in those animals selected for pathology.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. In a number of the studies, lesions or tumors detected under grossexamination were not examined microscopically.</ITAG>In the February 4, 1977 rule, FDA postponed the closing date for the provisionallisting of the color additives until January 31, 1981, for the completionof required toxicity studies. Subsequently, FDA published amendments tothe provisional regulations in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of April 7, 1978 (43 FR 14642), that requireda new multigeneration reproduction study for Dandamp;C Red No. 33 as anothercondition of its continued provisional listing. The deficiency in the reproductionstudy previously submitted by the petitioners to support the safe use ofthe color additive was described in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of December 13, 1977 (42 FR 62497; Docket No.76N-0366). FDA found the study to be inadequate for assessing the potentialfor the color additive to affect reproduction adversely following ingestion.The selection of test animals for the succeeding generations was not maderandomly, introducing a possible bias in the outcome of the studies. Evaluationof weaning weights of the animals to be used for subsequent generationsdisclosed that heavier, and, therefore, presumably healthier, test animalswere selected in more instances than would have been dictated by randomselection. This is an improper manner of selection as test animals selectedfor subsequent breeding should be representative of the available animalsas a whole. The possible bias that was introduced by not selecting animalsrandomly but rather by weight may have resulted in the nonselection ofanimals exhibiting adverse effects.In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of March 27, 1981 (46 FR 18954), FDA establishedthe closing date of March 31, 1983, for the completion of the evaluationof Dandamp;C Red No. 33. Because its review of the data and of the scientificand legal issues raised on this color additive took longer than the agencyanticipated, FDA had to extend the provisional listing of the color additiveon a number of occasions. On June 26, 1985 (50 FR 26377), FDA proposeda longer extension of the provisional listing for several color additives,including Dandamp;C Red No. 33, to provide for the submission of additionalinformation. On September 4, 1985 (50 FR 35783), the agency published afinal rule extending the provisional listing for Dandamp;C Red No. 33 untilMarch 3, 1987. On July 30, 1986, CTFA submitted additional information,which is discussed below. To provide time for the completion of its reviewand preparation of the appropriate documents, the agency further extendedthe closing date several times. The most recent extension was announcedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 1, 1988 (53 FR 25127), establishing thecurrent closing data of August 30, 1988.d. Citizen Petition Filed by Public Citizen Health Research GroupOn December 17, 1984, the Public Citizen Health Research Group (PublicCitizen) petitioned FDA to ban the use of the color additives that remainedprovisionally listed. On January 22, 1985, Public Citizen filed a complaintin the District Court for the District of Columbia seeking the same relief.Public Citizen alleged that, by continuing to provisionally list the coloradditives, including Dandamp;C Red No. 33, FDA had violated the Color AdditiveAmendments to the act, as well as those provisions of the AdministrativeProcedure Act (5 U.S.C. 706(1)) that pertain to unreasonable delay of agencyaction. Public Citizen sought to enjoin FDA from using the provisionallist or any other means to allow the marketing of the provisionally listedcolor additives.On June 21, 1985, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs sent to Public Citizena detailed response to the petition. In his response, the Commissionercarefully reviewed and discussed the arguments and information submittedin support of the petition. The Commissioner concluded that the publichealth would not be endangered by the continued marketing of the coloradditives while scientific, legal, and policy issues were addressed and,therefore, the Commissioner denied the petition.On February 13, 1986, Judge Stanley S. Harris granted FDA's motion forsummary judgment and dismissed Public Citizen's complaint. <T3>Public Citizen, et al.</T3> v. <T3>DHHS, et al.,</T3> No. 85-1573 (D.D.C. February 13, 1986). Public Citizen'sappeal of this decision was denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals, No. 86-5150(October 23, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Evaluation of the Safety of Dandamp;C Red No. 33</ITAG>A. <T3>Statutory Safety Requirements</T3>Under section 706(b)(4) of the act (21 U.S.C. 376 (b)(4)), the so-called``general safety clause'' for color additives, a color additive cannotbe listed for a particular use unless the data presented to FDA establishthat it is safe for that use. Although what is meant by ``safe'' is notexplained in the general safety clause, the legislative history makes clearthat this word is to have the same meaning for color additives as for foodadditives. (See H. Rept. No. 1761, ``Color Additive Amendments of 1960,''Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 86th Cong., 2d Sess. 11 (1960).)The Senate report on the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 states:<ITAG tagnum="21">The concept of safety used in this legislation involves the questionof whether a substance is hazardous to the health of man or animal. Safetyrequires proof of a reasonable certainty that no harm will result fromthe proposed use of an additive. It does not_and cannot_require proof beyondany possible doubt that no harm will result under any conceivable circumstances.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This was emphasized particularly by the scientific panel which testifiedbefore the subcommittee. The scientists pointed out that it is impossiblein the present state of scientific knowledge to establish with completecertainty the absolute harmlessness of any chemical substance.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">S. Rept. No. 2422, ``Food Additives Amendment of 1958,'' Committeeon Labor and Public Welfare, 85th Cong., 2d Sess. 6 (1958).FDA has incorporated this concept of safety into its color additive regulations.Under 21 CFR 70.3(i), a color additive is ``safe'' if ``there is convincingevidence that establishes with reasonable certainty that no harm will resultfrom the intended use of the color additive.'' Therefore, the general safetyclause prohibits approval of a color additive if doubts about the safetyof the additive for a particular use are not resolved to an acceptablelevel in the minds of competent scientists.The general safety clause is buttressed by the anticancer or Delaney clause(section 706(b)(5)(B) of the act), which provides that a color additiveshall be deemed to be unsafe ``for any use which will or may result iningestion of all or part of such additive, if the additive is found bythe Secretary to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal, or if itis found by the Secretary, after tests which are appropriate for the evaluationof the safety of additives for use in food, to induce cancer in man oranimal,'' and it shall be deemed unsafe ``for any use which will not resultin ingestion of any part of such additive, if, after tests which are appropriatefor the evaluation of the safety of additives for such use, or after otherrelevant exposure of man or animal to such additive, it is found by theSecretary to induce cancer in man or animal'' (21 U.S.C. 376(b)(5)(B)).The application of the Delaney clause to color additives was amplifiedrecently by a decision concerning Dandamp;C Orange No. 17 and Dandamp;C RedNo. 19 in <T3>Public Citizen, et al. </T3>v.<T3> Young, et al.</T3> (D.C. Cir. No. 86-1548, October 23, 1987):<ITAG tagnum="21">In sum, we hold that the Delaney Clause of the Color Additive Amendmentsdoes not contain an implicit <T3>de minimis </T3>exception for carcinogenic dyes with trivial risksto humans. We based this decision on our understanding that Congress adoptedan ``extraordinarily rigid'' position, denying the FDA authority to lista dye once it found it to ``induce cancer in * * * animals'' in the conventionalsense of the term.</ITAG>B. Earlier StudiesAmong the earlier toxicity studies on the color additive, submitted bythe petitioners before 1977, were acute oral toxicity studies in rats,dogs, and mice; short-term and chronic feeding studies in dogs and rats;a three-generation reproduction study in rats; teratology studies in ratsand rabbits; dermal studies in rabbits; and 2-year skin-painting studiesin mice. Some toxic effects, including hemolytic anemia and enlarged spleens,were observed at higher doses in the pre-1977 feeding studies, but theagency concluded that the color additive could be used safely until thecompletion of further testing.From the earlier studies with Dandamp;C Red No. 33 submitted by the petitioners,the agency has evaluated the dermal safety of the color additive. The datafrom these studies demonstrate that Dandamp;G Red No. 33 is nonirritatingwhen applied repeatedly to either intact or abraded skin. Furthermore,Dandamp;C Red No. 33 was not found to be carcinogenic in two studies in whichit was applied periodically to the skin of mice over their lifetimes.FDA has evaluated the genetic toxicity tests related to Dandamp;C Red No.33 found in the literature. The available information is fragmentary andinconsistent, and the agency considers the full complement of animal toxicitystudies to provide more pertinent information on safety than these in vitrotests. FDA finds no basis for further concerns in this information.C. New StudiesIn the new reproduction study required by the April 7, 1978, order, Sprague-Dawley(Charles River) COBS CD rats were fed dietary levels of 0, 0.25, 2.5, 7.5,and 25 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) per day of Dandamp;C Red No. 33. Twentyfemales and 20 males for each group were used to initiate the study, whichwas conducted for three generations. The selection of test animals forthe succeeding generations was made randomly. Examination of a number ofindices of viability, health, reproductive abnormality, and developmentaltoxicity in offspring and mothers did not reveal any pattern of adverseeffects. From evaluation of the new multigeneration reproduction studyin rats and of earlier teratology studies, agency scientists have concludedthat there have been no reproductive or teratogenic effects related totreatment with the color additive.Reports were submitted to FDA on the new chronic toxicity studies in ratsand mice required by the February 4, 1977, order. These new studies representcurrent state-of-the-art toxicological testing. The protocols for thesestudies have benefited from knowledge of deficiencies in previously conductedcarcinogenesis bioassays and other chronic toxicity protocols. The useof large numbers of animals of both sexes, pilot studies to determine maximumtolerated dosages, two control groups (thereby effectively doubling thenumber of controls), and in utero exposure in one of the two species tested,significantly increase the power of these tests to detect dose-relatedeffects.The reproduction and chronic studies were conducted for the petitionerby International Research and Development Corp., Mattawan, MI 49071. Thecolor additive fed to the animals in theses studies contained 88 percenttotal color.In the new chronic mouse study, Dandamp;C Red No. 33 was fed to Charles RiverCD-1 mice at dietary levels of 0, 0.1, 1, and 5 percent. Sixty femalesand 60 males were used for each dietary level and in each of 2 controlgroups. The male mice fed 5 percent Dandamp;C Red No. 33 were sacrificedat 57 weeks and the female mice fed 5 percent were sacrificed at 74 weeksdue to reduced survival. All other groups were sacrificed at 104 weeksof feeding. The mice fed 1 and 5 percent of Dandamp;C Red No. 33, comparedto the controls, showed hemolytic anemia and associated adverse effects,but no adverse effects were seen in mice fed 0.1 percent. No increasedincidence of tumors was related to feeding of the test substance. Basedon the evaluation of the results of this chronic mouse toxicity study,the agency has determined that Dandamp;C Red No. 33 did not cause cancerin Charles River CD-1 mice.In one chronic study, Sprague-Dawley (Charles River CD) rats were fed dietarylevels of 0, 0.25, 0.05, and 0.2 percent Dandamp;C Red No. 33 for 129 weeks.These rats were exposed in utero and during lactation by the feeding ofthe same dietary levels of Dandamp;C Red No. 33 to their parents. Seventyfemales and 70 males were used for each dietary level and in each of 2control groups.A related second study was performed with the same strain of rats, in whichthe animals, similarly exposed in utero and during lactation, were fedeither 0 or 2 percent of Dandamp;C Red No. 33. FDA requested that this feedinglevel be added to provide testing at the highest level compatible withcompletion of the test. The agency's analysis of data from earlier studiessuggested that this maximum level of 2 percent could be used without jeopardizingcompletion of the study. The males were sacrificed at 113 weeks of feedingand the females at 117 weeks. There were 70 animals of each sex in eachgroup.Tests rats in both studies showed adverse effects associated with hemolyticanemia. Decreases in erythrocyte counts, decreases in hemoglobin levels,and increases in reticulocyte counts were seen at the 0.2 percent and the2 percent doses. Also at the 0.2 percent dose, the males had increasedspleen/body weight ratios at the 12-month sacrifice and the females hadincreased spleen weights at the end of the study. No adverse effects wereseen at the 0.05 percent level or below.In the second rat study, survival of males fed 2.0 percent was less thanthe controls and the body weights of treated rats were decreased comparedto controls. The treated rats of both sexes showed enlargement of the spleenat 12 months and also at termination of the study. Both sexes of the treatedgroup showed a marked increase in parenchymal fibrosis of the spleen comparedto their controls. Both sexes also had splenic capsular fibrosis, and,in addition, the males showed fatty metamorphosis. In the spleens of the140 treated rats, the agency also found a few uncommon tumors: three fibrosarcomasand one hemangioma in males and one fibroma in females. One male controlrat had a hemangiosarcoma. The incidences of the various tumors are notsufficient to show carcinogenicity. Based on the evaluation of the resultsof both chronic rat studies, the agency has determined that Dandamp;C RedNo. 33 did not cause cancer in Sprague-Dawley rats.D. The Issue of Whether More Testing is Necessary1. <T3>Statement of the issue. </T3>In a notice of proposed rulemaking (50FR 26377; June 26, 1985), FDA stated that the chronic testing of both Dandamp;CRed No. 33 and Dandamp;C Red No. 36 did not reveal a carcinogenic effectin the animals in which they were tested. FDA noted increased incidencesof unusual, nonneoplastic splenic lesions in Sprague-Dawley rats fed highdoses of Dandamp;C Red No. 33. There were higher incidences of parenchymalfibrosis, enlargement, capsular fibrosis, and (in males) fatty metamorphosisof the spleen in animals fed the test compound than in the control animals.In the 140 rats fed Dandamp;C Red No. 33 there were three fibrosarcomas,one hemangioma, and one fibroma.In the proposal, FDA stated that if it had only results of the testingof Dandamp;C Red No. 33 and Dandamp;C Red No. 36 before it, the agency wouldlikely have approved the use of these color additives in spite of the observedeffects. However, the proliferative effects seen in the testing of Dandamp;CRed No. 33 and Dandamp;C Red No. 36 indicated to FDA that there was a similaritybetween these color additives and certain other compounds, such as Dandamp;CRed No. 9, that have been shown to be carcinogenic. When Dandamp;C Red No.9 was fed to Sprague-Dawley rats, a few rare tumors and numerous rare lesionsof the spleen were produced. These rats had the same kinds of nonneoplasticlesions as with Dandamp;C Red No. 33 and Dandamp;C Red No. 36. When Dandamp;CRed No. 9 was fed to Fischer 344 rats, however, numerous rare tumors ofthe spleen were produced, and Dandamp;C Red No. 9 was found to be a spleniccarcinogen in this strain.The association of the nonneoplastic splenic lesions with tumor occurrencesuggested to FDA that the nonneoplastic lesions may be precursors or indicatorsof the start of a carcinogenic process. This similarity of effects in theSprague-Dawley strain of rats between Dandamp;C Red No. 33, on the one hand,and Dandamp;C Red No. 9, on the other, raised concerns that Dandamp;C Red No.33 may be carcinogenic in the Fischer 344 rat. To clarify the significanceof this similarity of effects, FDA proposed that new studies be conductedon Dandamp;C Red No. 33 and Dandamp;C Red No. 36 (50 FR 26377; June 26, 1985).The agency stated that it believed that such studies would be the bestway to resolve the ambiguities about these color additives that had beencreated by the results of the testing with Dandamp;C Red No. 9 and othercompounds in Fischer 344 rats. The agency also noted, however, that itwould reconsider the issue of additional testing if data and informationwere received that showed that such testing was not necessary.As part of its effort to resolve this problem, FDA, in 1984, had askedthat a panel of experts from the National Toxicology Program's Board ofScientific Counselors examine the data on Dandamp;C Red No. 33 in conjunctionwith the data on Dandamp;C Red No. 9. FDA sought the guidance of the Boardon two questions: ``(1) Do the results of the long-term feeding studiesof Dandamp;C Red No. 33 in CD-1 (Charles River) mice and Sprague-Dawley (CharlesRiver) rats indicate a possible carcinogenic effect that could be attributedto exposure to this color additive? (2) In particular, do the splenic changesin rats constitute evidence of neoplastic potential?''The Board met on July 26, 1984, and provided the following response:<ITAG tagnum="21">1. Quantitatively, the low incidence rates for primary mesenchymalneoplasms of the spleen in male and female Charles River CD-1 rats givenlong term dietary administration of 2% Dandamp;C Red No. 33 could not beconsidered sufficient to be categorized as a demonstrated carcinogenicresponse to chemical treatment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. Qualitatively, there appears to be treatment-related nonneoplastictarget organ (spleen) toxic responses which are similar to those previouslydescribed for certain other aromatic azo compounds, aromatic nitro compounds,and amines.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Further research is necessary and should be directed toward developingunderstanding of the mechanisms of the toxic action of this particularfamily of compounds in the spleen of rats. (Ref. 1).</ITAG>FDA agrees with the Board's first point and concludes that the evidencedoes not establish Dandamp;C Red No. 33 to be a carcinogen. The incidencesof splenic tumors in Sprague-Dawley rats (produced by Charles River) donot show carcinogenicity.The agency agrees with the Board's second point, that there were similarnonneoplastic splenic effects produced with Dandamp;C Red No. 33 as therewere with others in this family of compounds. FDA acted on this basis inpublishing the proposal on June 26, 1985 (50 FR 26377).The Board's third recommendation was intended to apply to the narrow questionof what is needed to further scientific understanding, and not what isneeded to protect the public health.The petitioners' comments on the 1985 proposal suggested that conductinga risk assessment based on the comparative toxicities of Dandamp;C Red No.9, Dandamp;C Red No. 33, and Dandamp;C Red No. 36 in Sprague-Dawley rats wouldshow that additional testing would not be necessary to protect the publichealth. The petitioner later submitted a lengthy comparative assessmenton the relative splenic toxicities of the three color additives.2. <T3>Resolution of the issue. </T3>The agency carefully considered the petitioners'comments and concluded that, if the splenic toxicity associated with theuse of these color additives were produced by the major components of thecolors, then it should be possible to evaluate the health concern raisedby the color additives using the data from the studies involving the Sprague-Dawleyrat and the Dandamp;C Red No. 9 study in the Fischer 344 rat. FDA concludedthat knowledge of the relative toxicities of these additives would enablethe agency to make a determination about the safety of Dandamp;C Red No.33 and Dandamp;C Red No. 36 without requiring new long-term studies (50 FR35783 at 35788; September 4, 1985).FDA has conducted its own comparative evaluation based on the relativetoxicities of Dandamp;C Red No. 9 and Dandamp;C Red No. 33 (Ref. 2). The assessmentshows that, even assuming that Dandamp;C Red No. 33 were carcinogenic ifsubjected to further testing in a strain of rat other than the Sprague-Dawley,the theoretical, upper-bound, lifetime risk associated with exaggerateduse exposure to the compound would be extremely small, that is, less than3 andmultiply; 10^7 (Ref. 3).In light of this comparative evaluation, the agency has reconsidered whetheradditional chronic testing of Dandamp;C Red No. 33 is necessary to establishthe safety of the compound. When deciding whether to require additionaltesting for a compound under review, the agency routinely follows the principlearticulated in its toxicology guidelines that ``the degree of effort expendedin reducing uncertainty about the safety of an additive ought to relatein some concrete way to the likelihood that the substance poses a potentialfor health risk to the public * * *.'' (Ref. 4, p. 10). By showing thatthe splenic toxicity presents no reasonable likelihood of harm to the public,the assessment adequately responds to the agency's initial concern thatadditional testing of the additive would be necessary to protect the publichealth. In fact, in light of the assessment, to require additional testingwould be pointless from a public health perspective and contrary to agencypractice.Accordingly, the agency concludes that the existing carcinogenicity studiesconcerning Dandamp;C Red No. 33 are adequate for the evaluation of the coloradditive.E. Summary of the Safety Evidence for Dandamp;C Red No. 331. <T3>Adequacy of the submitted studies to demonstrate safety. </T3>The seriesof studies completed by the petitioner satisfies the usual requirementsto demonstrate safety for a color additive that will be ingested and applieddermally. The studies were properly conducted and are acceptable undertoday's standards of toxicity testing. Agency scientists have found noadverse effects related to treatment with the color additive in doses upto the highest dose of 25 mg/kg in the teratology studies or in the 3-generationreproduction studies. The long-term studies in dogs, mice, and rats allshowed the hemolytic anemia syndrome prominently at high doses. The highestdose level that did not show this syndrome was 150 mg/kg (0.1 percent)in mice, 12.5 mg/kg in dogs, and 25 mg/kg (0.05 percent) in rats. Thus,the safety studies established a no-observed-effect-level of 12.5 mg/kgbody weight or higher in all species tested.Based on its evaluation of these studies and on its analysis of concernsraised by studies on Dandamp;C Red No. 9, the agency concludes that the datashow that no harm will result from using Dandamp;C Red No. 33 under the conditionsprescribed.2. <T3>Negative results of carcinogenicity studies. </T3>As discussed above,the agency believes that these studies are adequate to determine whetherDandamp;C Red No. 33 is carcinogenic. No significant increased incidenceof any type of tumor, in any of the many tissues examined, in either sex,in any dose group, in any strain of any species tested, by either ingestionor skin application, was associated with Dandamp;C Red No. 33 treatment inany of the studies. Thus, after thorough evaluation of these studies, whichmeet modern design standards for tests to determine carcinogenicity, theagency finds that Dandamp;C Red No. 33 has not induced cancer in any of thelaboratory testing. As stated above, the National Toxicology Program'sBoard of Scientific Counselors has also concluded that the data do notdemonstrate a carcinogenic response to treatment. Accordingly, the Delaneyclause is not applicable to the decision on this color additive.3. <T3>Conclusion. </T3>For the foregoing reasons, the agency considers thatthe direct testing of Dandamp;C Red No. 33 show that the color additive issafe for use in drugs and cosmetics.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Potential Carcinogenic Impurities </ITAG>For the reasons discussed above, the agency considers that the direct testingof Dandamp;C Red No. 33 shows that the color additive is safe for use indrugs and cosmetics. The agency must still consider, however, any riskposed by possible carcinogenic impurities in Dandamp;C Red No. 33. A. The Impurities Found During the safety review, the agency developed a new analytical methodologyfor examining the color additive for the presence of trace level impurities.Analyses by this new methodology found six carcinogenic impurities in commercial,certified batches of Dandamp;C Red No. 33 (Refs. 5 and 6). The carcinogenicimpurities that the agency detected are 4-aminoazobenzene, 4-aminobiphenyl,aniline, azobenzene, benzidine, and 1,3-diphenyltriazene. These impuritiesresult from impurities in the starting materials used to manufacture thecolor additive, remaining traces of starting material, and from reactionsinvolving these impurities during the manufacturing process. The regulationset forth below establishes specifications that would limit the concentrationsof all six of these impurities in future batches. Because of its concerns about the carcinogenic impurities, the agency hasanalyzed representative samples from 10 certified batches of the coloradditive (Refs. 5 and 6). The results of the analyses, expressed as concentrationin parts per billion (ppb), for the 6 carcinogenic impurities in these10 batches are summarized in Table I. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s25,8,xls36,8</C><T4>Table I._Levels of Impurities Found in D</T4>andamp;<T4>C </T4><T4>Red No. </T4>33 <H1>Impurity </H1><H1>No. of batches (out of 10)</H1>a containing detectable amounts of impurity<H1>Range of impurity concentration (ppb) </H1>b <H1>Average impurity level in 10 samples (ppb)</H1>c  <ITAG tagnum="1">4-Aminoazobenzene <D>10 </D><D>50-3, 100 </D><D>500 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4-Aminobiphenyl <D>10 </D><D>40-530 </D><D>260 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aniline <D>10 </D><D>2,000-19,900 </D><D>8,300 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Azobenzene <D>2 </D><D>ND-2,200 </D><D>410 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzidine <D>4 </D><D>ND-60 </D><D>15 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,3-Diphenyltriazene <D>8 </D><D>ND-410 </D><D>100 </D><F/>a Thirteen certified batches were analyzed but each batch was notnecessarily analyzed for all six impurities.

B. Prior Actions by FDA The current testing of Dandamp;C Red No. 33 has not proven it to be a carcinogen,and, thus, the anticancer clause does not apply to it. Nevertheless, theagency must still consider whether the color additive, in light of thefact that it may contain carcinogenic impurities, may be safely used indrugs and cosmetics. The agency is using the same approach for this situation concerning impuritiesin Dandamp;C Red No. 33 as it used to examine the risk associated with thepresence of minor carcinogenic impurities in FDandamp;C Yellow No. 5 (50FR 35774; September 4, 1985), and FDandamp;C Yellow No. 6 (51 FR 41765; November19, 1986), both of which may contain the same impurities as those foundin Dandamp;C Red No. 33. These color additives had not been shown to be carcinogenicby appropriate bioassays. FDA concluded that the use of each of these coloradditives, within prescribed specifications, is safe. The agency's position is supported by <T3>Scott </T3>v. <T3>FDA</T3>, 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984). That case involved a challengeto FDA's decision to approve the use of Dandamp;C Green No. 5 (47 FR 24278;June 4, 1982), which contains a carcinogenic chemical but has not itselfbeen shown to cause cancer. Relying heavily on the reasoning in the agency'sdecision to list Dandamp;C Green No. 5, the United States Court of Appealsfor the Sixth Circuit rejected the challenge to FDA's action and affirmedthe listing regulations. The assessment procedure used to estimate risk from an impurity has twoaspects: (1) Assessment of the probable exposure to the impurity from theproposed use of the additive, and (2) extrapolation of carcinogenic potencyobserved in the animal bioassay with the impurity to the conditions ofprobable human exposure. C. Exposure to Carcinogenic Impurities in Dandamp;C Red No. 33 The agency has estimated the maximum risk from exposure to the carcinogenicimpurities that may result from use of Dandamp;C Red No. 33 in drugs andcosmetics. The lifetime exposure to Dandamp;C Red No. 33 is not expectedto exceed 160 micrograms/person/day (<T2>u</T2>g/person/day) internally and 800 <T2>u</T2>g/person/day from dermal exposure, for the high users (Ref. 2).With these estimates, the agency has examined the likely exposures to thecarcinogenic impurities in Dandamp;C Red No. 33. In adopting specifications for Dandamp;C Red No. 33, FDA considered the concentrationsof the carcinogenic impurities that were present in the certified batchesof the color additive that the agency recently surveyed and in the batchesused for the toxicological testing. The agency believes that the specifications listed in the first columnof Table II are readily obtainable under current good manufacturing practiceand will assure safe use of the color additive. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table II_Estimated Impurity Exposure at the Specification Limits </T4><H1>Impurity</H1><H1>Specification (ppb) </H1><H1>High User Exposure (ng/day) \1\ Systemic </H1><H1>Dermal</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">4-Aminoazobenzene<D>100</D><D>0.02</D><D>0.08</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4-Aminobiphenyl<D>275</D><D>.04</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aniline<D>25,000</D><D>4.0</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Azobenzene<D>1,000</D><D>.2</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzidine<D>20</D><D>.003</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,3-Diphenyl-triazene<D>125</D><D>.02</D><D>.1</D><F>\1\ ng=Nanograms (1 billionth of a gram).</F></ITAG></ITAG>Table II also gives the estimated high user exposure to the impuritiesif each batch of the color additive contained each impurity at the maximumlevel allowed by the specifications. The systemic exposure is calculatedby multiplying the high user exposure for the color additive itself (160<T2>u</T2>g/day by ingestion) by each specification. Systemic exposureto these impurities from dermal application will be negligible comparedto ingestion because the major fraction of exposure to this color additiveresults from its ingested uses and because only a small fraction of a dermallyapplied product is likely to be absorbed. Two of the impurities, 4-aminoazobenzene and 1,3-diphenyltriazene, havebeen shown not only to be systemic carcinogens when ingested but also tobe skin carcinogens when applied dermally. Accordingly, for these two impurities,the agency has estimated the risks from dermal exposure as well as thosefrom systemic exposure. FDA has based its estimates of dermal exposureon the high user exposure to Dandamp;C Red No. 33 (800 <T2>u</T2>g/day) multiplied by each specification (Ref. 7). D. Risk Estimations for Impurities The second part of the evaluation of the risk presented by the presenceof the impurities is an extrapolation from the actual compound-relatedincidence of tumors found in animal bioassays, under conditions of exaggeratedexposure, to the conditions of much lower probable exposure for humans.The agency has used estimates of carcinogenic potency and estimates ofexposures to the carcinogenic impurities for high users of Dandamp;C RedNo. 33 (with all carcinogenic impurities at the maximum concentrationsallowed by the specifications) to estimate risks for exposure to each impurity(Ref. 7). The agency then summed these risks to derive the maximum upperbound risk associated with lifetime exposure to Dandamp;C Red No. 33. The agency searched the scientific literature for evidence on the carcinogenicityof the impurities found in Dandamp;C Red No. 33. If more than one study foundone of these impurities to be carcinogenic, the agency identified the studythat was most suitable to estimate risk. Although, in general, these studieswere not designed to estimate risk and were often deficient under currentstandards, they are the only studies available and can not be ignored.Also, the reports did not always provide all the information necessaryfor a risk estimate. The agency has thus attempted to make assumptionsand corrections that would provide estimates that are reasonable whilenot underestimating the risk. These assumptions and corrections are discussedmore fully in the discussions of each constituent. 1.<T3> 4-Aminoazobenzene.</T3> The agency has evaluated reports showing that4-aminoazobenzene is carcinogenic in the diet of rats (Refs. 8 and 9),and that it is carcinogenic when applied dermally to rats (Ref. 10). Theagency has developed a risk estimate from each of these studies. A study implicating 4-aminoazobenzene as a carcinogen by dietary administrationto Wistar rats was reported by Kirby et al. (Ref. 9). The study reportedthat 7 of the 16 animals in the treated group were found to have livercell neoplasms after a total of 120 weeks. Six rats in this group displayedpapillomas of the stomach. No information is available to determine whetherany of the individual rats had neoplasms in both the liver and the stomach.The dose was allowed to vary throughout the experiment. The agency calculatedthe average dose over 120 weeks to be 0.25 percent in the diet (Ref. 11).4-Aminoazobenzene was also implicated as a carcinogen in a skin paintingstudy in which 1.0 milliliter (mL) of a 0.2 percent acetone solution containing4-aminoazobenzene (corresponding to a dose of 2 mg of 4-aminoazobenzeneper application) was applied to the skin twice weekly on six male albinorats. This was part of a larger study utilizing a number of azo compounds(Ref. 10). All six male rats in the treatment group displayed skin neoplasmsafter 123 weeks compared to none in the control group. The agency has estimated that the lifetime risk of cancer from systemicexposure to 4-aminoazobenzene is less than 3 in 1 trillion from productscontaining Dandamp;C Red No. 33 (Refs. 5 and 11). The data indicate, however,that 4-aminoazobenzene may be a more potent carcinogen at the site of applicationto the skin than when absorbed systemically. The agency has estimated thatthe lifetime risk of skin cancer from dermal application is less than 2in 1 billion (Refs. 5 and 11). Because the risk estimate for dermally appliedproducts is larger than for ingested products, FDA is using this higherestimate to evaluate total risk.2. <T3>4-Aminobiphenyl. </T3>A number of studies in different species havebeen performed on 4-aminobiphenyl. The agency has chosen a dog study reportedboth by Block et al. and by Rippe et al. for quantitative risk assessmentbecause the data on this study yield a higher risk estimate than data fromother studies (Refs. 12, 13, and 14).In this study, 24 pure-bred female beagle dogs were administered 4-aminobiphenylorally, by capsule, at a dosage level of 5 mg/kg body weight for 5 daysa week. Cystoscopic examinations were made routinely starting at 16 monthsand continuing up to 41 months after commencement of treatment. Diagnosesat 24 months showed that 22 of 24 treated dogs had bladder papillomas.Because this incidence is so high, data at later times show essentiallythe same incidence. Data at earlier times show a lower incidence, proportionalto the lesser exposure time. The agency concludes that data obtained at24 months are the most reliable for risk assessment because, among otherreasons, more complete histopathology was performed at this time (Ref.14).Under circumstances in which lifetime risk must be estimated from studiesthat are performed for less than a lifetime, the data must be correctedto account for the fact that the animals were at risk for less than a lifetime.Typically, tumor incidence has been thought to be proportional to somepower of time (Ref. 15). The agency believes that, in the absence of specificdata, it is reasonable to make adjustments based on a model that uses thethird power of the time exposed (Refs. 14 and 15).Because 24 months represent approximately one-fifth of the lifetime ofa beagle dog, the agency has corrected for the rapid induction of theseneoplasms in the calculation of lifetime risk. Extrapolating directly fromthe data and making a correction for less than lifetime exposure, the agencyestimates that the lifetime risk of cancer from systemic exposure to 4-aminobiphenylin products containing Dandamp;C Red No. 33 is less than 2 in 100 million(Refs. 5 and 14).3. <T3>Aniline. </T3>Data reported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI)demonstrated that aniline was carcinogenic to the spleen of Fischer 344rats (Ref. 16). This finding has subsequently been verified by a dietarystudy performed by the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology (CIIT)using the same strain of rat (Ref. 17). FDA used data from the CIIT studyto estimate that the lifetime risk of cancer from systemic exposure toaniline in products containing Dandamp;C Red No. 33 is less than 4 in 100billion (Refs. 5 and 18).4. <T3>Azobenzene. </T3>In an NCI-sponsored bioassay reported in 1979, azobenzeneinduced a dose-related increase in the incidence of sarcomas of the abdominalcavity, particularly the spleen, in both sexes of Fischer 344 rats (Ref.19). Three groups of animals of both sexes were given 0, 200, and 400 partsper million (ppm) in the diet. From this study, the agency estimates thatsystemic exposure to azobenzene in products containing Dandamp;C Red No.33 presents a lifetime risk of less than 2 in 100 billion (Refs. 6 and20).5. <T3>Benzidene. </T3>FDA used a human epidemiology study by Zavon (Ref.21) and a study performed by Rinde and Troll in the rhesus monkey (Ref.22) as the basis for a quantitative risk assessment on benzidine. Zavonattempted to obtain good data on exposure to benzidine by analyzing theurine of workers in a plant that manufactures this substance. The workerswere monitored until a number of them were diagnosed as having bladderneoplasms. Urine levels of benzidine in workers were measured before eachwork shift, after each work shift, and on every Monday morning. Averagelevels were: before work, 0.01 milligram per liter (mg/L); after work,0.04 mg/L; and on Monday morning before work,  somewhat  below  0.005 mg/L.No controlled study with the administration of benzidine and the concomitantmeasurement of benzidine in the urine in humans has been performed. Thus,the conversion from urine concentration to total exposure cannot be madefrom human data alone. However, the Rinde and Troll study related ingestionof benzidine to amounts of benzidine and monoacetylbenzidine in the urineof rhesus monkeys. The agency believes it is reasonable to use this studyto relate urine concentration to exposure for humans (Ref. 23). This procedureyields a higher risk estimate than if the risk was estimated solely froman animal feeding study and thus is less likely to underestimate risk.In the Rinde and Troll study, benzidine was administered orally to rhesusmonkeys, and the 72-hour urine collection was analyzed for benzidine andmonoacetylbenzidine. In two trials the amount of benzidine and monoacetylbenzidineexcreted in the urine was 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent of the initial input.The agency used these data, and applied a safety factor of two to compensatefor uncertainties, to estimate that the amount of benzidine and monoacetylbenzidineexcreted in the urine of humans is approximately 3 percent of that consumed.The agency then calculated that the average human worker in the Zavon studywas exposed to approximately 0.8-mg benzidine per work day. Based on thesetwo studies, the agency estimates that systemic exposure to benzidine fromproducts containing Dandamp;C Red No. 33 presents a lifetime risk of lessthan 2 in 100 million (Refs. 5 and 23).6. <T3>1,-Diphenyltriazene. </T3>The agency has evaluated reports showingthat 1,3-diphenyltriazene is carcinogenic in the diet, and that it is carcinogenicwhen applied dermally. A study performed by Otsuka (Ref. 24), while deficientin certain aspects, showed that 1,3-diphenyltriazene produced forestomachtumors in mice upon dietary exposure. The compound was administered inthe diet at a concentration of 0.04 percent for 483 days. Although thisdietary study is quite old and was terminated after 16 months, the agencybelieves that it is usable if corrected for less than lifetime exposure.Assuming that the average lifetime of a mouse is 24 months, the agencyhas corrected for less than lifetime exposure by assuming the risk of cancerincreases as the third power of the time exposed (Refs. 15 and 25). Therefore,the agency has used a correction factor of 3.4, i.e., (24 months/16 months)\3\, which increases the estimated risk.Using this correction, the agency estimates that systemic exposure to 1,3-diphenyltriazenefrom products containing Dandamp;C Red No. 33 presents a lifetime risk ofless than 4 in 1 trillion (Refs. 6 and 25).A lifetime skin-painting study using 1,3-diphenyltriazene on mouse skinwas performed by Kirby (Ref. 26). This skin study involved a thrice weeklyapplication of a 5-percent solution of the test compound in acetone. In16 mice surviving more than 300 days, 3 developed squamous cell papillomaand 3 developed squamous cell carcinoma. One mouse that developed a carcinomacould not be identified as part of this experiment or a parallel experiment.The agency has assumed that this mouse was part of this experiment so asnot to underestimate risk. As was often the case in the 1940's, when thisstudy was conducted, the amount of solution applied to the skin of theanimals was not accurately measured and thus not reported for this experiment.The failure to measure and to report this information creates problemsin conducting a quantitative risk assessment. However, in later years,the standard protocol for this kind of study in mice became the applicationof 0.20 mL of solution to the skin. Because the agency does not know whetheras much as 0.20 mL was applied, it has made a more conservative assumptionthat 0.10 mL was used in order to estimate the risk. Using this procedure,the agency estimates that dermal exposure to 1,3-diphenyltriazene fromproducts containing Dandamp;C Red No. 33 presents a lifetime risk of lessthan 1 in 100 billion (Refs. 6 and 25).E. Cumulative Risk EstimatesIn evaluating FDandamp;C Yellow No. 5, the agency established a procedureof setting specifications for more than one carcinogenic constituent forthe same color additive (50 FR 35774; September 4, 1985). The agency usedthe same procedure when it evaluated the safety of FDandamp;C Yellow No.6 (51 FR 41765; November 19, 1986) and is using it again in evaluatingthe safety of Dandamp;C Red No. 33 because it is necessary to consider themost appropriate way to evaluate the risk from simultaneously consumingsmall amounts of several carcinogenic agents.The Office of Science and Technology Policy discussed the issue of exposureto multiple carcinogenic agents in a document entitled ``Chemical Carcinogens;A Review of the Science and Its Associated Principles'' (50 FR 10371, 10394;March 14, 1985) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Since people are exposed to many different agents at the differenttimes in different sequences, the effect of multiple agents on carcinogenesisis of major concern. However there is little information of general importin the field. Models for interaction are generally limited by lack of informationon dose-response curves for carcinogens in the area of interest. The greatnumber of permutations of possible agents and doses makes understandinginteraction of multiple agents very difficult.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In general, the action of two or more agents can be additive (if theagents are given in a dose range where the biological response is a linearfunction of dose) or multiplicative (if the response is a simple exponentialresponse to dose), synergistic (greater than expected) or antagonistic(less than expected).</ITAG>The agency knows of no method where by potential multiplicative, synergistic,or antagonistic interactions can be incorporated into a generalized riskassessment process. Furthrmore, at the dose levels under consideration(far below those having measurable pharmacologic or physiologic activity),the agency sees no reason to consider synergistic or antagonistic interactions.When one extrapolates carcinogenicity data downward to very low doeses,one is, in effect, assuming that the carcinogens are acting independently,and that no interactions occur. Thus, if the probability of developingcancer from one substance is independent of the probability of developingcancer from another substance, then the probability of developing cancerfrom either substance may be obtained from summing the individual probabilities.Therefore, in the absence of specific information on the interactions amongthe carcinogenic impurities, the agency believes that, operationally, therisks incurred from the presence of multiple carcinogenic impurities ina color or food additive can be considered independent, and that the estimatedupper bound risks should be summed.The individual risk estimates discussed earlier show that the impuritiesother than 4-aminobiphenyl and benzidine make negligible contributionsto the total risk. Table III shows the total upper bound risk, estimatedby summing the risk estimate from each carcinogenic impurity when presentat the highest level, consistent with specifications, to be 4 in 100 million.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table III_Upper Bound Risk Estimates Based on Specifications for CarcinogenicImpurities in Dandamp;C Red No. </T4>33<H1>Impurity</H1><H1>Lifetime cancer risk</H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">4-Aminoazobenzene \1\<D>0.000000002</D><D>(2X10</D>^9)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4-Aminobiphenyl \1\<D>0.00000002</D><D>(2X10</D>^8)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aniline<D>0.00000000004</D><D>(4X10</D>^11)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Azobenzene<D>0.00000000002</D><D>(2X10</D>^11)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzidine<D>0.00000002</D><D>(2X10</D>^8)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,3-Diphenyltriazene \1\<D>0.00000000001</D><D>(1X10</D>^11)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sum \2\<D>0.00000004</D><D>(4X10</D>^8)<F>\1\ The risk for skin cancer is used here because it is higher thanthe risk estimated for systemic cancer.</F><F>\2\ In summing risk estimates, numbers have been rounded off to thenearest significant figure.</F></ITAG></ITAG>The agency emphasizes that these upper bound risk estimates are worst caseestimates that are used to assure that there is a reasonable certaintythat use of an additive will not cause harm. Consequently, several assumptionsused for the estimate tend to overestimate rather than underestimate risk.For example, the linear model used to extrapolate risk to low dose exposureis a conservative model. It is used to generate an upper bound estimateof an unknown risk, not to predict an actual risk.Furthermore, the agency's risk estimates are based on the assumption thatall carcinogenic impurities are present at the maximum concentrations allowedby the regulations. In reality, any batch with any impurity concentrationabove a specification would be rejected while batches with lower concentrationswould be allowed. Therefore, unless all batches of certified color additivehave impurity concentrations exactly at the specification limits, the averageconcentration of each impurity will be lower than the maximum allowed.Finally, the agency points out that the levels of the impurities foundin Dandamp;C Red No. 33 are so low that under no circumstances could a bioassaydetect a carcinogenic effect from these impurities.The agency has considered the potential presence of these impurities inother color additives as part of this evaluation. Dandamp;C Red No. 33, FDandamp;CYellow No. 5, and FDandamp;C Yellow No. 6 all can contain the same carcinogenicimpurities (50 FR 35774 at 35776; September 4, 1985 and 51 FR 41765 at41774; November 19, 1986). Currently, the agency can estimate risks onlyfor products containing these three color additives with these impurities.Simple addition of the upper bound risks for high users of each color additive(all projected to have the impurities present at the levels of the specifications)would give a value of less than 8 in 10 million. Although this value isclearly exaggerated, FDA sees no need to refine the analysis when the riskis so low.The agency believes that the maximum risk to consumers from the use ofDandamp;C Red No. 33 alone or in combination with the other additives issufficiently low that it can conclude that the use of batches of Dandamp;CRed No. 33 that meet the specifications adopted by this rule is safe. Theagency is aware that some of these carcinogenic impurities may occur alsoin some color additives other than FDandamp;C Yellow No. 5 and FDandamp;C YellowNo. 6. Due to the small amounts of these other color additives that aremanufactured, or the limited usage, FDA does not expect any noticeablerisk from these sources. The agency will review any risk resulting fromexposure to these impurities in other color additives, and will take whateverregulatory action is needed to protect the public health, when sufficientinformation is available for an appropriate decision.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.

Conclusions </ITAG>The agency concludes that Dandamp;C Red No. 33 is safe under the conditionsof use set forth below for general use in drugs and cosmetics, and thatcertification is necessary for the protection of the public health. Inreaching this conclusion, the agency evaluated a full battery of animalfeeding and dermal studies adequate to demonstrate the safety of a coloradditive. The agency also performed a comparative evaluation on the splenictoxicity of Dandamp;C Red No. 33 and Dandamp;C Red No. 9 to determine whetheradditional animal safety testing was needed to achieve a reasonable certaintythat no harm would result from use of Dandamp;C Red No. 33. Based on allthe relevant data, including the comparative splenic toxicity evaluation,the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm fromuse of the additive and that further testing is unnecessary and of no benefitto the public health. The final toxicity study reports, interim reports, and the agency's evaluationsof these studies are on file at the Dockets Management Branch (addressabove) and may be reviewed there between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday throughFriday. The agency concludes that it is necessary to have limitations on the levelsof Dandamp;C Red No. 33 that may be used in drugs and cosmetics to assuresafe use. The petitioners have not submitted the required data for eye-area use.Therefore, FDA now considers that portion of the petition that includedthe permanent listing of Dandamp;C Red No. 33 for eye-area use to be withdrawnwithout prejudice in accordance with the provisions of andSection; 71.4 (21CFR 71.4). Use of Dandamp;C Red No. 33 in the area of the eye has never beencovered by provisional listing. The agencys listing of a color additivefor general use in drugs and cosmetics does not encompass eye-area use.The agency is describing the color additive in this regulation accordingto the current Chemical Abstracts nomenclature, which differs somewhatfrom the nomenclature FDA previously used. The agency concludes that it is necessary to include in the listing regulationsfor Dandamp;C Red No. 33 a brief description of its manufacturing processto ensure the safety of the color additive. FDA has included that descriptionto define as closely as possible the color additive that has been testedand shown to be safe. The agency is doing so because use of a differentmanufacturing process is likely to produce different impurities that havenot been considered in establishing specifications for this color additive.The agency is not able at this time to set specifications that would controlthe presence of all such impurities. FDA is willing to consider petitionsfor alternative manufacturing processes, but those petitions should containevidence that demonstrates that those processes will not produce impuritiesthat will make use of the color additive unsafe. The agency has contracted with the National Academy of Sciences/NationalResearch Council (NAS/NRC) to develop appropriate specifications for coloradditives for use in food as part of the Food Chemical Codex. Similarly,appropriate specifications for color additives for use in drugs and cosmeticswill be developed following the general guidelines used by NAS/NRC in itsevaluation of color additives used in food. The agency concludes that specifying,through a general decription, the manufacturing process in the regulationsfor this color additive will provide an adequate assurance of safety untilsuitable specifications can be developed. The agency finds that because of the presence, or possible presence, ofcarcinogenic impurities in the color additive, specifications for impuritiesare necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, specifications aslisted in Table II, column 2, of this preamble are included in the regulation.In the past, Dandamp;C lakes have been permitted to be prepared from uncertifiedstraight color additives. The resulting lakes would subsequently be certified.However, to assure that all lakes meet the specification limits for thecarcinogenic impurities and that the use of lakes remains consistent withthe evaluation, the agency is establishing the requirement that all lakesof Dandamp;C Red No. 33 be prepared from certified batches of the straightcolor additive. Accordingly, andSection; 82.1333 is amended to reflect thisrequirement.This order does not permanently list Dandamp;C Red No. 33 lakes. FDA publisheda notice of intent in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of June 22, 1979 (44 FR 36411), which discussedthe additional information that the agency believes is needed before finalregulations on lakes can be issued. FDA intends to publish proposed regulationsgoverning the use of color additives in lakes in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>in the near future and concludes that the listingof color additives for use in lakes can best be implemented by generalregulations. Dandamp;C Red No. 33 lakes will, therefore, continue to be provisionallylisted for coloring drugs and cosmetics under Parts 81 and 82 (21 CFR Parts81 and 82).The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(b)(3) that this action isof a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significanteffect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessmentnor an environmental impact statement is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII.
