The value of newly started construction contracts fell to anannual rate of $249.9 billion last month from $256.8 billion inApril, the F.W. Dodge Group of McGraw-Hill Information Services Co.said Wednesday.   Despite last month's slight decline, the group said theconstruction outlook in the second quarter and for the rest of theyear looked promising due to a downturn in interest rates.   ``Lower interest rates in the rest of the year will help sustainthe current rebound, and we're upgrading our 1989 outlook forconstruction,'' said George A. Christie, F.W. Dodge's chiefeconomist.   Overall construction contracting for the first five months of theyear totaled $100.72 billion, down 1 percent from a year earlier.   During May, newly started commercial, industrial andinstitutional structures rose 11 percent to an annualized $91.4billion, Dodge said.   Industrial construction, which set the pace for nonresidentialwork in May with a 40 percent increase, included a $300 millionexpansion of a petrochemical complex near Houston.   Residential building, meanwhile, slipped 9 percent in May to anannualized $115.3 billion, largely due to previously higher interestrates.   Contracting for non-building construction, including public worksprojects, fell 11 percent last month to an annualized value of $43.2billion.</TEXT></DOC>
