Ms. Bordsen, who relies on a daily 4:30 a.m. wake-up callfrom her mother, didn't miss one day of phone service -- orwork -- when she moved last month, thanks to a new automatictelephone connection service. &quot;It was the fastest my phonehas ever been hooked up,&quot; she says. &quot;When I moved before, ittook almost a week to get service.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Several phone companies are experimenting with ways tomake Ms. Bordsen's experience routine. In some tests, newresidents can turn on their own service. In others, customerscan suspend or disconnect service and add or cancel specialfeatures, such as call forwarding, call waiting and three-waycalling. By increasing the customer's role, telephonecompanies hope to hold down labor costs and eliminateinstallation delays.   To get service in Bellingham, within Denver-based U S WestInc.'s territory, a new resident plugs a touch-tone phoneinto a jack and punches 811 on the telephone key pad. Acomputer asks questions that can be answered by pressing moredigits, or customers can talk to a phone companyrepresentative. In less than 20 minutes, the phone isoperating, compared with the usual two-day wait until atechnician arrives.   Companies that don't have the sophisticated technology yetare still finding ways to speed service installation.BellSouth Corp. recently announced that some new customerscan plug in their phones and order service from a customerrepresentative. Service ordered before 3 p.m. is turned onthe same day.   Several Baby Bells offer variations of automated orders.Pacific Bell, a unit of San Francisco-based Pacific TelesisGroup, is conducting tests in Sacramento, Calif., in whichclients order special features on a touch-tone phone. SinceMay, Michigan Bell, a unit of Chicago-based Ameritech, haslet people order custom-calling features the same way. NewJersey shore vacationers can already suspend service fromPhiladelphia-based Bell Atlantic Corp. after the summer, andRutgers University students may disconnect serviceautomatically. Brooklyn customers of New York-based NynexCorp. and customers throughout Atlanta-based BellSouth'sterritory have been able to use touch-tone phones todisconnect or suspend service and order special featuressince 1989.   But automation isn't problem free. Gary Ames, president ofU S West's telephone company unit, acknowledges &quot;a healthyinternal argument&quot; about whether to expand automated servicesor allow more human intervention in the customer sign-upprocess. At BellSouth, a spokesman says that evensemiautomated service may mean less hiring, although thecompany has no plans to lay off employees. Some technicianswill be reassigned to repair lines and install cables insteadof connecting residential service.   Still, the impact on employees may be painful. The newtechnology is expected to reduce the number of sales,clerical and repair jobs and threatens to cut the skill levelrequired for those that remain. The prospect worries theCommunications Workers of America. &quot;I'm concerned that thenew jobs will not be of a technical nature but moreredundant, repetitive, less-skilled work that is lower paid,&quot;says John Hamilton, president of CWA Local 7800.   Jim Elias, director of the U S West project, acknowledgesthe eventual effect on jobs. &quot;When it all settles down,&quot; hesays, &quot;there will be fewer people required to operate theexchange, that is for sure.&quot; Mr. Elias says he is unable toproject the labor savings but considers the union's attitude&quot;quite supportive.&quot;   U S West is on the forefront of automated services, butofficials won't disclose savings projections. The company hasinvested $20 million in its Bellingham project over the past18 months to study residents' habits, cut labor costs,replace aging telephone lines with fiber optics and revamparchaic data bases.   Bellingham is an ideal test bed: a community of 49,000with a large population of fishermen, college students andother transient residents. Isolated by Puget Sound and theCascade Mountains, Bellingham is on a separate U S Westtelephone exchange so that experiments there won't confusephone customers in Seattle, 80 miles to the south.   Horizon Airlines agent Holly Otis used the automatedservice to transfer her phone number when she moved. &quot;Itworked in my old apartment while I was moving, and thatevening my phone worked in the new one,&quot; she says. WesternWashington University senior Robb Faller says his new phonewas connected &quot;just about immediately,&quot; in contrast with thefive-day delay he experienced as a freshman.   When university students returned last September, theservice-on-demand system helped U S West handle a surge of1,726 orders in two days instead of the usual two weeks. LastMarch, a month when many fishermen head for Alaska's salmonbanks and students end a quarter, about 450 disconnect orderswere cleared through the system.   Bugs in the computerized service must be fixed before U SWest takes &quot;live jacks&quot; beyond Bellingham, a move it plans tomake in a little more than a year. Odd situations stump thecomputer. For example, Judy Channel tried to disconnect herphone in January before moving to nearby Ferndale, a townoutside the Bellingham exchange.   The computer balked when she couldn't provide her newphone number. When she called an hour later with theinformation, the computer wasn't working and she had to waiton hold for about 15 minutes before she got an operator. &quot;Ifthere is any idiosyncrasy at all,&quot; Mrs. Channel says, &quot;it'sthat you have to wait forever for an operator.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
