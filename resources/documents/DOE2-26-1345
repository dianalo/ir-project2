<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-26-1345 </DOCNO><TEXT>NMR measurements on /sup 12/B nuclei implanted in a thin sheet of highlyoriented pyrolytic graphite (Grafoil) have been made to study the magnitudeof the polarization of /sup 12/B and its electric quadrupole coupling.The magnitude of the residual polarization of /sup 12/B held in carbonmaterial is of crucial importance to the experiment measuring the averagepolarization of /sup 12/B produced in the muon capture by /sup 12/C.It was found that the polarization of /sup 12/B can be maintained at101.0+-2.2% in Grafoil under a magnetic field of 3 kG. The electric quadrupolecoupling was determined to be e/sup 2/qQ/h=+1207.3+-8.2 kHz. From themagnitude and the sign of the electric field gradient eq, the locationof /sup 12/B was found to be a substitutional site in the carbon lattice.The anomalous B-C bond involving the sp/sub 2/ hybrid orbitals with partiallyfilled p/sub z/ electrons is also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
