Houghton said he was &quot;verynervous&quot; about next year because of the economy.   In an interview, Mr. Houghton also said he was comfortablewith estimates that 1991 per-share earnings, excludingunusual items, would increase 16% to $3.20 from $2.76 in1990.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Houghton called &quot;disturbing&quot; the decline in thecompany's sales growth from 15% in the first half to 9% inthe third quarter and 6% in the fourth quarter. With theexception of an unusually strong third quarter, in whichoperating profit rose 27%, profit rose 10% to 12% for therest of the year. &quot;It just shows that the economy hasn'tpicked up, and it's mushy out there,&quot; he said.   Corning has budgeted for a &quot;moderate&quot; increase in 1992profit and plans to boost capital expenditures to $400million next year, from about $300 million this year. Whilethe company believes it can maintain a low double-digitgrowth rate in a weak economy and a 15% to 20% rate in astrong economy, Mr. Houghton said, &quot;It's totally unclear tome what's going to happen&quot; next year.   In the fourth quarter 1990, net was $74.3 million, or 80cents a share, on sales of $772.8 million. For all of 1990,Corning earned $292.0 million, or $3.07 a share, on sales of$2.94 billion, including a gain of $29.2 million on the saleof investments. Both periods included tax credits.   Corning's results were buoyed by its sales of opticalfiber and cable, which telephone companies use to replacecopper wires. The business is growing at an annual rate of15% to 20%; Corning has invested $150 million to expand itsoptical fiber plant in Wilmington, N.C. Corning's televisionglass venture in Korea, Samsung Corning, has improved on itspoor year-earlier quarter, which was hurt by Korean laborstrikes and taxes.   Aided by acquisitions, Corning's MetPath medicallaboratory testing unit has also lifted results, Mr. Houghtonsaid. The improved results offset economy-relateddisappointments in Corning's environmental testing and otherlaboratory services.   The company's consumer products business, a laggard inrecent years, was flat again in the fourth period as salesrose slightly. Mr. Houghton said a bad year in Europe andBrazil offset gains in the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
