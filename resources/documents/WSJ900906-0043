Terms weren't disclosed, but industry sources close to thedeal put its value at &quot;in excess of $500 million&quot; to theUnited Technologies Corp. unit over about five years.</LP><TEXT>   Between 80 and 100 choppers are expected to be produced,with the Koreans taking an increasingly larger role in themanufacture of the aircraft as the project goes on. BlackHawks, the U.S. Army's front-line, medium-lifttroop-transport helicopters, typically sell for about $7million to $8 million each domestically.   A Sikorsky spokesman declined to provide any specifics ofthe pact, and a spokesman for Korean Air in Los Angeles saiddetails weren't immediately available. Military attacheofficials at the Korean Embassy in Washington couldn't bereached.   Paul Nisbet, aerospace analyst with Prudential-BacheSecurities, said the Korean government had negotiated thecontract first with the manufacturer, rather than putting itout to bid, which is the usual process. At one point, though,the Koreans gave at least informal consideration to a modelof the Huey-Cobra, made by Textron Inc.'s Bell Helicopterdivision, according to industry sources.   Eugene Buckley, president of Sikorsky, said the approvalmarked another &quot;major milestone&quot; in the company's efforts toincrease its international market share. It was announced inconjunction with the aerospace industry's big annual airshow, which is being held this week in Farnborough, England.   The negotiations on the helicopter agreement apparentlytook a number of months to settle. Korean Air, parent of thenation's flag-carrier airline, was recently designated by theKorean government as one of the three companies that willbuild aircraft as part of a consolidation of that nation'saerospace industry.   Korean Air, itself a unit of the conglomerate HanjinGroup, has assembled several hundred light helicopters and isinvolved in the manufacture of jet fighters. It also makesparts for Boeing Co.'s 747-400 passenger jet, as well asMcDonnell Douglas Corp.'s MD-80 and MD-11 airliners.   Late last year, Seoul said it would buy or co-produce 120McDonnell Douglas F/A18 strike fighters in an arrangementvalued at $3 billion. The Black Hawk program is part ofKorea's force improvement effort. The baseline aircraft willbe the standard U.S. Army UH-60L helicopter withT700-GE-701-C engines; the avionics will be tailored toKorean specifications.</TEXT></DOC>
