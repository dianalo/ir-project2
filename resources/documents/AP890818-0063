The federally protected witness told the Senate JudiciaryCommittee in an electronically disguised voice that before his 1985arrest he smuggled up to 55 tons of cocaine into the United Statesas an employee of ``the boys from Colombia.''   He has been cooperating with the government and has a price onhis head that committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., placed at $3million.   Biden called the hearing to provide background before theadministration unveils its comprehensive drug-fighting program nextmonth.   Mermelstein said the United States has been slowed in its movesto combat Colombian traffickers in part ``because we deal directlywith the police and local governments and in South America that's adirect line to the cartel.''   High-ranking Army officers appear immune to cocaine corruption inColombia, he said, but other officials are either bribed or murdered.   ``Either they take the money or they die,'' he said.   He said the corruption was by no means confined to Colombia andthat he was once ``offered a deal of so much per kilo for anycocaine confiscated by the Bahamian government for distribution inthe United States.''   ``We were setting it up but I was arrested,'' he said.   He said one cartel pilot, forced by plane trouble to set down inCuba with a load of cocaine, was told a $10,000 payoff would alwaysbuy emergency landing privileges.   Cocaine kingpins have used billions of ``narcodollars'' from U.S.sales to follow a globe-hopping lifestyle, with visits to thebullfights in Mexico and Spain as well as the Olympic games inKorea, Mermelstein said.   In other testimony, the commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen.Alfred Gray, told the panel he is skeptical about so-called bootcamps advocated by some law enforcement officials for young drugoffenders instead of prison.   ``I can tell you right up front if you don't provide analternative it will fail,'' he said, adding that Marine boot camp isdesigned to produce fighting men and not to punish offenders.   ``It's a completely different kind of socialization,'' he said.   He said the ``center of gravity'' in fighting drugs in America ison the side of stopping demand rather than supply and was criticalof the idea of a military attack on South American coca fields.   ``I hope we can have a more balanced and far-reaching thoughtprocess ... because we live in a more complex world than that, and Ithink we all know that,'' he said.   A former assistant U.S. attorney in Miami, Richard Gregorie, toldthe committee the Customs Service and the Marshals Service developeda plan to arrest Colombian drug kingpin Jorge Ochoa last fall duringa trip to Caracas, Venezuela, and fly him to the United States fortrial, but the plan was dropped because of State Departmentopposition.   Ochoa has been indicted by U.S. grand juries several times, butthe Colombian Supreme Court abrogated that country's extraditiontreaty with the United States two years ago and he cannot bearrested by his country's authorities on a U.S. warrant.</TEXT></DOC>
