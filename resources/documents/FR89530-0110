This notice established the rules of procedurefor and the date of a hearing on the issues raised in the notice. By subsequentagreement of the parties, however, the hearing was cancelled, a stipulatedrecord was filed, and the case was submitted on briefs. On November 14,1988, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Edward Terhune Miller issued a RecommendedDecision (R.D.) finding that the Minnesota unemployment compensation lawis not in conformity with applicable Federal law. The State of Minnesotahas filed exceptions to the ALJ's recommended finding, and the AssociateSolicitor for Employment and training Legal Services of the United StatesDepartment of Labor (Associate Solicitor) has filed a response to Minnesota'sexceptions. The matter is now before me for decision for purposes of certificationunder section 3304(c) of FUTA and section 303(b) of SSA.Specifically before me is whether Minnesota's recoupment provision, section268.165 of the Minnesota employment compensation law, Minn. Stat. Ann.268.165 (West 1988 Supp.), meets the requirements of section 3304(a)(4)of FUTA and the requirements of section 303(a)(1) and (a)(5) of the SSA.Under section 3304(a)(4) of FUTA and under section 303(a)(5) of SSA, allmoney withdrawn from the unemployment fund must be used in payment of unemploymentcompensation. Compensation is defined in section 3306(h) of FUTA as ``cashbenefits payable to individuals with respect to their unemployment.'' 26U.S.C. andSection; 3306(h). Section 303(a)(1) of the SSA requires that astate unemployment compensation law provide for such methods of administrationas will ensure full payment of unemployment compensation when due. Certainexceptions to the requirement that funds be used exclusively in the paymentof unemployment compensation are statutorily provided for but none of theseare applicable here.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>See </T3>R.D. at 7-8 and 11-12 for exceptions.Subdivision 1 of section 268.165 of the Minnesota law permits the deductionand withholding of up to 50 percent of an individual's unemployment compensationpayment for unpaid contributions, interest, penalties and costs for whichthe individual has been determined to be liable. Thus, an unemployed claimantwould not receive in hand the full amount of his or her cash benefits ifthe claimant owed contributions to the unemployment fund from a prior periodwhen the claimant had been an employer. The question, therefore, ariseswhether the reduction in the claimant's cash benefits for the purpose ofrecouping contributions owed conforms to the Federal statutory prescriptionsas to use of unemployment fund monies.The ALJ's recommendation, that I find Minnesota's recoupment provisionin nonconformity with Federal law, is based on the ALJ's analysis of theapplicable FUTA and SSA provisions. Specifically, the ALJ concluded thatthe statutory language is clear and unambiguous, and that the legislativehistory and historical application of the FUTA and SSA provisions supportthe limiting of the use of unemployment fund monies to cash benefits forunemployed claimants or to certain other specifically stated expenditures.The ALJ then found that Minnesota's recoupment provision involves the constructivewithdrawal of funds for a purpose other than permitted by law and resultedin the unemployed claimant failing to receive full benefits when due.Upon review of the entire record in this case, I agree with the analysisand conclusions of the administrative law judge. I thus adopt, and appendhereto, the ALJ's decision but with certain technical corrections requestedby the Associate Solicitor. <T3>See </T3>U.S. Department of Labor's Response to Minnesota's Statementof exceptions at 8-9. These corrections are:1. At page 2, line thirteen is changed to read: ``payment of grant moniesunder andSection; 303(b) of SSA, and with.''2. At page 10, the first sentence of the first full paragraph is changedto read: ``Sections 3303(b) and 3304(c) of FUTA require that the statelaws conform to Federal requirements governing the use of unemploymentfunds in order for employers to receive normal and additional tax creditswith respect to their rates of contributions.''3. At page 14, line 8 is changed to read: ``certification under section303(b) of SSA and section 3304(c) of FUTA, regardless of.''4. At page 18, line 16, ``andSection; 3306(b)'' is changed to read: ``andSection;3306(h).''5. At page 18, line 10, from line 5 ``andSection;andSection; 3302(a), 3302(b),and'' are omitted, and from line 6 ``or certified as provided in andSection;3303(b) of FUTA'' are omitted.6. All references to ``unemployment compensation fund'' are changed to``unemployment fund.''I, therefore, find that the Minnesota unemployment compensation law nolonger contains the provisions specified in sections 3304(a)(4) of FUTAand in sections 303(a)(1) and (a)(5) of SSA, and that the State of Minnesotahas failed to substantially comply with such sections. Accordingly, thestate of Minnesota will not be included in the listing of those stateswhich will be certified by me to the Secretary of Treasury for the yearending October 31, 1988, in accordance with section 3304(c) of FUTA, and,furthermore, certification in accordance with section 303(b) of SSA iswithheld.<ITAG tagnum="6">Ann McLauglin,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of Labor.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Washington, DC</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">In the Matter of Minnesota Conformity</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Case No. 88-UIA-9</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Gary E.

(1988) (``SSA'') and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act,26 U.S.C. andSection;andSection; 3301 <T3>et seq. </T3>(1988)(``FUTA'').The Secretary has notified the Governor of Minnesota that Minnesota maynot be certified as eligible for certain Federal assistance because shehas reason to believe that Minn. Stat. andSection; 268.165 (1967 Supp.) (``therecoupment amendment'') causes the Minnesota unemployment compensationlaw not to conform to the requirements of andSection;andSection; 303(a)(1)and 303(a)(5) of SSA and andSection; 3304(a)(4) of FUTA. The basis for suchnotice is that Minnesota law provides for withholding unemployemnt benefitsfrom otherwise eligible claimants to satisfy indebtedness for unpaid contributionsto the State's unemployment compensation fund. Notice of hearing was alsosent by the Secretary to the Minnesota Department of Jobs and Trainingin conformity with 20 C.F.R. andSection; 601(5)(d).In response to that notice, Minnesota filed a timely request for a hearing.Jurisdiction is assumed under 26 U.S.C. 3304(c)(1988), 42 U.S.C. andSection;503(b)(1988), and 20 C.F.R. 601.5(a). Pursuant to the request of the partiesand Order dated September 30, 1988, a stipulated record was timely filedby the parties on October 13, 1988, and the oral hearing schedueld by theNotice of Hearing for October 4, 1988, was canceled. The parties filedtimely briefs and reply briefs in conformity with the Notice of Hearingand the Order dated September 30, 1988. There has been no request to participateas intervenor or amicus curiae.This Determination is based upon the stipulated record, and applicablelaw and regulations, taking due consideration of the contentions of theparties as set forth in their respective briefs and reply briefs.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The stipulated record consists of thirteen documents,numbered one through thirteen. These documents are referred to as Exhibits(``EX.'') 1-13, respectively.IssueThe question presented for resolution in this proceeding is whether, withrespect to certification for payment of grant moneys under 302(a) of SSA,and with respect to certification of States on October 31, 1988, under3304(c) of FUTA, the law of Minnesota has been amended so that it no longerincludes the provisions required by 303(a)(1) and 303(a)(5) of SSA and3304(a)(4) of FUTA relating to the State's provision of unemployment compensation.The parties agree that the issue to be decided is one of statutory constructionand that the facts are not in dispute.The Secretary's BriefThe Secretary contends that 303(a)(5) of SSA and 3304(a)(4) of FUTA requirethe Minnesota unemployment compensation law to provide that all money withdrawnfrom the unemployment fund of the State be used solely in the payment ofunemployment compensation. The only exceptions to this general requirementare authorized or required by statute as enacted by Congress. The Secretaryhas no discretion to grant exceptions to this general requirement. Statesare also without authority to enact exceptions to the requirement. TheMinnesota recoupment amendment, by its provisions and method of administration,impermissibly deprives a claimant of the full payment when due of unemploymentcompensation to which he or she is entitled with respect to his or herunemployment, and, in effect, withdraws such funds not paid to the claimantfrom the fund for the purpose of paying unpaid contributions, interest,penalties, and costs owed by the claimant, but which relate to when theclaimant was an employer.In allowing such reductions in payments and withdrawals from the Minnesotaunemployemnt compensation fund, the recoupment amendment contravenes andSection;303(a)(1) of SSA, which requires that the Minnesota unemployment compensationlaw provide methods of administration which will reasonably insure fullpayment of unemployment compensation when due. The legislative historyof the applicable federal laws confirms the strict and fundamental statutorymandate that moneys withdrawn from the state's unemployment fund must beexpended, with limited exceptions, for the payment of unemployment compensationto which claimants are entitled as a matter of right by reason of theirunemployment, without regard to criteria unrelated to such unemployment.The purpose of the legislation, as established by its pertinent legislativehistory, is to provide temporarily for the immediate basic necessitiesof persons who have become unemployed.These principles of interpretation have been consistently applied by theSecretary of Labor throughout the history of the unemployment compensationprogram. Since exceptions to the application of these principles in theFederal laws are established by Federal statute only, the policy justificationsadvanced by Minnesota in support of its recoupment amendment are irrelevant.A reduction of a claimant's benefits for reasons unrelated to the individual'sunemployment is deemed tantamount to an impermissible withdrawal of moneysfrom the State's unemployment compensation fund. Prior erroneous paymentsof benefits, however, are tantamount to advance payment of benefits relatedto the individual's perceived unemployment. On the other hand, collectingunpaid tax contributions, interest, penalties, and costs by a reductionof cash benefits as provided by the recoupment amendment is related toa claimant's prior status as an employer, and not to his or her unemployment.To the extent that <T3>Brewer </T3>v. <T3>Cantrell</T3> \2\<NOTE/> implies that some physical withdrawal of moneys from thefund is required to establish a violation of Federal requirements, the<T3>Brewer</T3> Court's interpretation of the withdrawal standard is deemederroneous.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 622 F. Supp. 1320 (D.C. Va. 1985) (State law authorizingrecoupment of overpayments of unemployment compensation from subsequentbenefits payments held not to violate Federal statutory scheme, due process,or equal protection).Minnesota's BriefMinnesota contends that the Secretary's interpretation of the applicableprovisions of SSA and FUTA is not dispositive, and that the recoupmentamendment does not render the law nonconforming to SSA or FUTA. Moneysin the Minnesota unemployment compensation fund are, and would be, usedfor payment of cash benefits when due, in accordance with applicable requirementsfor timeliness, as required by SSA and FUTA.Minnesota contends further that the recoupment amendment merely treatspersons who have failed to contribute to the state's unemployment compensationfund as required by law in the same manner as those persons who have beenoverpaid benefits from the fund. Such treatment avoids the anomalous situationwhich allows employers to retain contributions required by the fund toprovide benefits to their employees, but to receive benefits from thatfund regardless of personal indebtedness to the fund incurred while theclaimant was an employer. The recoupment amendment is patterned after andanalogous to the exception to SSA and FUTA under 3304(a)(4)(D), which providesthat amounts may be deducted from unemployment benefits and used to repayoverpayments as allowed by 303(g) of SSA. The Minnesota recoupment provisionmerely reduces the benefits payable to a Claimant liable for delinquentcontributions up to fifty percent of the benefits to which he or she wouldotherwise be entitled, but does not require that amount to be withdrawnfrom the fund. This critical distinction prevents the Minnesota law frombeing nonconforming.To refute the Secretary's assertion that she does not have discretion toapprove the recoupment amendment as an exception to established Federalrequirements, Minnesota cites the Secretary's authorization of the useof compensating bank balances and the use of interest on fund depositsfor administrative expenses as an exercise of discretion affecting theuse of moneys in an unemployemnt compensation fund under the applicableFederal laws. Minnesota also contends that the recoupment amendment wascarefully developed with the assistance of representative interests ofthe state, and that its implementation has enabled, and will in the futureenable, the State to recover substantial sums from delinquent claimantswho have personal liability for unpaid employers' contributions. The recoupmentamendment is also consistent with the intent of Congress regarding theexpenditure of moneys in the unemployment compensation fund. Such recentexceptions as the application of benefits to recovery of overissuance offood stamps and for child-support payments reflects a liberal Congressionalattitude toward the basic restrictions on expenditures of moneys in thefund. Findings of Fact 1. On June 2, 1987 the State of Minnesota enacted the recoupment amendment,designated andSection; 268.165 of the Minnesota unemployment compensationlaw, Minn. Stat. andSection; 268.165 (1987 Supp.), which became effectiveAugust 1, 1987. 2. Minn. Stat. andSection; 268.165 provides: <T3>Subdivision 1. </T3>Withholding of unemployment benefits. Notwithstandingsection 268.17, the commissioner may deduct and withhold up to 50 percentof each unemployment compensation payment payable to an individual underthis chapter for unpaid contributions, interest, penalties, and costs whichthe individual has been determined liable to pay. <T3>Subd. 2. </T3>Effect of payments. Any amounts deducted and withheldunder this section shall be treated as if paid to the individual as benefitsand paid by the individual to the department in satisfaction of the individual'sdelinquent contributions, interest, penalties, and costs. <T3>Subd. 3. </T3>Priority of withholding. Any amounts deducted and withheldunder this section have priority over any other levy, garnishment, attachment,execution, or setoff, except for the recoupment of benefit overpaymentsallowed under section 268.18. 3. At the same time, Minn. Stat. andSection; 268.18 (1986) was amended tolimit to 50% the amount withheld from unemployment compensation benefitpayments to repay benefit overpayments (Ex. 11). 4. Minnesota has recovered substantial amounts of delinquent employers'contributions since enactment of the recoupment amendment (Ex. 12). 5. andSection; 3304(a)(4) of FUTA provides in relevant part: The Secretary of Labor shall approve any State law * * * which he findsprovides that * * * all money withdrawn from the unemployment fund of theState shall be used solely in the payment of unemployment compensation,exclusive of expenses of administration * * * [with certain specified exceptions].andSection; 3304(c) of FUTA provides in relevant part: On October 31 of each taxable year the Secretary of Labor shall certifyto the Secretary of the Treasury each State whose law he has previouslyapproved, except that he shall not certify any State which, after reasonablenotice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency, the Secretary ofLabor finds has amended its law so that it no longer contains the provisionsspecified in subsection (a) or has with respect to the 12-month periodending on such October 31 failed to comply substantially with any suchprovision in such subsection * * * andSection; 3306(h) of FUTA provides in relevant part: For purposes of this chapter, the term ``compensation'' means cash benefitspayable to individuals with respect to their unemployment. andSection; 302(a) of SSA provides in relevant part: The Secretary of Labor shall from time to time certify to the Secretaryof the Treasury for payment to each State which has an unemployment compensationlaw approved by the Secretary of Labor under the Federal Unemployment TaxAct such amounts as the Secretary of Labor determines to be necessary forthe proper and efficient administration of such law. . . . andSection; 303(a) of SSA provides in relevant part: The Secretary of Labor shall make no certification for payment to any Stateunless he finds that the law of such State, approved by the Secretary ofLabor under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, includes provision for ** * (1) such methods of administration * * * as are found by the Secretaryof Labor to be reasonably calculated to insure full payment of unemploymentcompensation when due; and * * * (5) Expenditure of all money withdrawnfrom an unemployment fund of such State, in the payment of unemploymentcompensation, exclusive of expenses of administration * * * [and for certainrefunds, and subject to certain provisos]. 6. Congress has enacted several exceptions to the withdrawal standard establishedby andSection;303(a)(5) of the SSA and 3304(a)(4) of FUTA. These statutoryexceptions are payment of disability benefits pursuant to 03(a)(5) of SSAand 3304(a)(4)(A) of FUTA; payment of health insurance pursuant to andSection;303(a)(5) of SSA and 3304(a)(4)(C) of FUTA; repayment of overpayments ofbneefits pursuant to andSection;andSection; 303(a)(5) and (g) of SSA and 3304(a)(4)(D)of FUTA; repayment of food stamps overissuances pursuant to andSection; 303(d)(2)(B)of SSA; payment of child support obligations pursuant to 303(e)(2)(A) ofSSA; and self-employment allownaces pursuant to andSection; 9152(e)(a), Pub.L. 100-203 (1987). 7. On May 27, 1987, prior to the enactment of the recoupment amendment,the Acting Regional Administrator, on behalf of the Secretary, informedMinnesota that the proposed Minnestoa recoupment amendment conflicted withthe Federal requirements of andSection;andSection; 303(a)(1) and 303(a)(5)of the SSA, and andSection; 3304(a)(4) of FUTA (Ex. 8). The Commissionerof the Minnesota Department of Jobs and Training provided an explanatoryresponse dated November 23, 1987. The response sought to justify the recoupmentamendment and stated that for technical reasons there would be no futurerecoveries under the recoupment amendment of penalties, interest, or costsdue from benefits payable to unemployed claimants (Ex. 7). 8. On July 13, 1988, the Acting Assistant Secretary informed Minnesotathat, unless Minnesota took action to resolve the conflict with the Federalrequirements, he would recommend that the Secretary initiate a conformityproceeding (Ex. 6). 9. The Secretary, on August 25, 1988, notified the Governor of Minnesotathat she had reason to believe that the State of Minnesota might not becertified under andSection; 3304(c) of FUTA for the twelve month period endingon October 31, 1988, and that she had reason to believe that certificationmight not be made in the future for the payment of administrative grantsto the State of Minnesota under Title III of the SSA, because of the apparentconflict of andSection; 268.165.1 of the Minnesota Jobs and Training Lawwith the requirements of andSection; 3304(a)(4) of FUTA, and andSection;andSection;303(a)(1) and 303(a)(5) of SSA. (Ex. 4) 10. The Secretary advised the Governor that ``[t]hese sections of Federallaw have long been interpreted as prohibiting any levy, attachment or otherremedy for the collection of public or private debt, prior to the receiptby the claimant of the benefits otherwise payable.'' (Ex. 4) 11. The Secretary also advised the Governor that withholding such certificateswould result in all employers who are subject to the Federal tax imposedby andSection; 3301 of FUTA losing all tax credits otherwise allowable pursuantto andSection; 3302 of FUTA. She advised that withholding certification mightalso affect reimbursement under the Federal law of the Federal share ofextended benefit expenditures made by the State. She advised that as tothe issue arising under the SSA, her findings would affect the certificationof payment of grant funds to the State under Title III of the SSA, andmight affect grants under the Wagner-Peyser Act, 29 U.S.C. andSection; 49d(b).(Ex. 4) 12. The Secretary advised the Governor that she had offered the MinnesotaDepartment of Jobs and Training an opportunity to participate in the proceedingswhich would lead to a determination of the issues in question. (Ex. 4)13. A similar notice was sent on August 25, 1988, to the Commissioner,Department of Jobs and Training, of Minnesota, advising him that with thenotice, the Secretary was commencing conformity proceedings and offeringthe Minnesota agency an opportunity for a hearing. The Secretary announcedthat the purpose of the proceedings would be to determine whether the lawof Minnesota conforms to the requirements of andSection; 3304(a)(4) of FUTA,so that it can be certified for the tax credits available under andSection;3302 of FUTA, for 1988. The purpose would also be to determine whetherthe Minnesota law conforms to the requirements of andSection;andSection; 303(a)(1)and 303(a)(5) of SSA, as a condition for receiving administrative grants.(Ex. 5)14. On September 7, 1988, Minnesota requested a hearing (Ex. 3). A Noticeof Hearing dated September 21, 1988, was issued pursuant to andSection; 303(b)of SSA, andSection; 3304(c) of FUTA, and 20 C.F.R. andSection; 601.5(a), andwas served upon all interested parties in a timely manner (Ex. 1; Ex. 2).15. On October 13, 1988, the parties submitted the case to the AdministrativeLaw Judge on a stipulated record, and filed briefs and reply briefs inaccordance with the requirements specified in the Notice of Hearing. ThisRecommended Decision is also timely filed in accordance with the requirementsof that Notice of Hearing.Discussion<ITAG tagnum="81">Application of Strict Controls Over the Use of Unemployment CompensationFunds Is Not Discretionary</ITAG>Sections 3303(b) and 3304(c) of FUTA provide that, in order to receivespecified Federal assistance related to State unemployment compensationprograms and the administration of those programs, State laws must conformto the Federal requirements governing the use of unemployment compensationfunds. The Secretary must certify annually that a State's unemploymentcompensation laws are in conformity with, and are administered in a mannerwhich satisfies these Federal requirements, so that the State may be eligiblefor the Federal benefits. The language of the governing Federal statutesdoes not expressly or by implication provide any discretion to the Secretaryor to the States with unemployment compensation programs in complying withthe explicit Federal statutory requirements.The issue presented in this case is one of statutory interpretation. Therefore,the Secretary's interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions isnot dispositive. However, the Secretary's interpretation of the statutoryrequirements has historically been consistently strict and uncompromising(<T3>See </T3>Ex. 9; Ex. 10). There is insufficient basis in this recordto determine, whether, as Minnesota suggests, the use of compensating balanceswould constitute a non-statutory exception to the general restriction thatcould be deemed analogous to the Minnesota recoupment amendment. The onlyrelevant evidence is, on its face, a proposal and solicitation for comment,not an implementing instruction or order (Ex. 13).<ITAG tagnum="81">The Statutory Language Specifying the Federal Requirements Is Plainand Unambiguous</ITAG>The language of andSection; 303(a)(5) of SSA and andSection; 3304(a)(4) ofFUTA, which govern the use of unemployment compensation funds, is plainand unambiguous in its requirement that moneys in a state's unemploymentcompensation fund be applied, exclusive of administrative costs, and exceptfor certain express exceptions, exclusively to the payment of unemploymentcompensation benefits. Section 3306(h) of FUTA states that the right ofa claimant to payment of unemployment compensation, is the right to a cashbenefit payable to the individual by reason of his unemployment. Thereis no provision for application of other criteria not related to his unemployment.Under the express formulation of andSection; 303(a)(1) of SSA, those benefitsmust be paid in full when due, that is, promptly and directly to the claimant,without deferral, as a matter of right.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The administrative requirement for full payment of unemploymentcompensation ``when due'' is basically a requirement for timeliness. <T3>See Fusari </T3>v. <T3>Steinberg</T3>, 419 U.S. 379 (1975). However, the right to timely paymentsubsumes a threefold purpose ``(1) To give prompt partial wage replacementso that the unemployed and their families would not be forced on relief;and (2) To provide security to assist the wage earners in finding work;and (3) To help stabilize industry by providing purchasing power to theunemployed when most needed (footnote omitted)'' <T3>See UAW </T3>v. <T3>Michigan Employment Security Comm'n</T3>, 517 F. Supp. 12, 17 (E.D.Mich. 1980), citing California Dep't of Human Resources Dev. v. Java, 402U.S. 121 (1971).<ITAG tagnum="81">Except for Certain Statutory Exceptions, Unemployment Funds Must BeUsed Exclusively for the Payment of Unemployment Compensation Benefits</ITAG>The parties have cited certain specific statutory exceptions to the categoricalrestrictions imposed by andSection; 303(a)(5) of SSA and andSection; 3304(a)(4)of FUTA. Those exceptions authorize withholding unemployment compensationbenefit payments for the following purposes: to offset prior overpaymentsof benefits; to recoup overissuance of food stamps; for self-employmentallowance; for application to health insurance costs; for payment of disabilitybenefits; and for application to child support payments.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ andSection;andSection; 303 (a)(5) and (g) of SSA, andSection;3304(a)(4)(D) of FUTA; andSection; 303(d)(2)(B) of SSA; andSection; 9152(e)(1)Pub. L. 100-203 (1987); andSection; 303(a)(5) of SSA, andSection; 3304(a)(4)(c)of FUTA; andSection; 303(a)(5) of SSA, andSection; 3304(a)(4)(A) of FUTA; andSection;303(e)(2)(A) of SSA. The Secretary's Reply Brief attached as an exhibitto the Departmental instructions issued to State Employment Security Agencieson the implementation of the Child Support Intercept (Withholding fromUnemployment Compensation), Unemployment Insurance Program Letter No. 15-82,April 8, 1982. The brief pointed out that, although the states had beeninformed in those instructions that deductions from unemployment compensationfor certain spousal support payments were permitted, the Department hassince concluded that there is no authority for such deductions and thatthe states will be so advised. Since the document was not included in theStipulated Record, and since counsel's representation is not evidence,the implications, if any, of these representations are not addressed.Some of these exceptions involve the application of moneys from the state'sunemployment compensation fund to the kind of immediate necessities ofthe claimant and his or her family, i.e. child support or health insurance,for which the unemployment compensation program was intended to provide.The others involve withholding benefit payments when due and creditingthe amount withheld against amounts deemed to be benefit payments previouslyadvanced in error. In such cases a claimant is deemed to have receivedall payments to which he is entitled when due, and not to be deprived ofbenefits to which he is entitled under the established purpose of the applicableFederal statutes. In neither case do these statutory exceptions do violenceto the purposes of the Federal statutory requirements.On the other hand, neither of these types of deductions and withholdingshave purposes which are analogous to the purpose of Minnesota's recoupmentamendment. That law purports to reduce benefit payments in order to recoupamounts owed to the State's unemployment compensation fund by reason ofobligations incurred while the claimant, in a prior distinguishable incarnation,was an employer. Such a purpose is manifestly unrelated to a claimant'sunemployment which entitles him to unemployment compensation.Congress itself has defined the only exceptions to the fundamental requirementsof the legislation. SSA and FUTA neither explicitly nor implicitly authorizeeither the Secretary or the individual States to modify or augment thoseexceptions. The pertinent legislative history buttresses this restrictiveview. However rational or persuasive the policy considerations for creatingan exception might seem, the sole source of any additional exceptions mustbe Federal legislation if history is considered and the essential purposeof the legislation is to be respected. It is evident that if exceptionswere permitted on convenient rationales conceived <T3>ad hoc </T3>by authorities other than Congress, the strictures reflectedin the statutory language and its legislative history would probably dissipateand become virtually meaningless and unenforceable. Minnesota's attemptto justify an exception by analogizing its recoupment amendment to theauthorization for recoupment of benefit overpayments under andSection; 303(a)(5)of SSA exemplifies this danger. By making that analogy, Minnesota, in effect,concedes that its recoupment amendment constitutes a new and distinguishableexception to the existing list of statutory exceptions. By contrast, inandSection; 303(a)(5) of SSA, Congress has specifically authorized deductionsfrom unemployment benefits to be used to recover overpayments of benefits,but only under strictly controlled procedures.<ITAG tagnum="81">The Recoupment Amendment Contemplates an Unauthorized Withdrawal andApplication of Moneys From Minnesota's Unemployment Compensation Fund</ITAG>Minnesota's contention that the moneys withheld from an unemployed claimantare not actually withdrawn from the unemployment compensation fund andthat their retention actually benefits the fund does not validate the recoupmentamendment. Withholding benefits in conformity with the recoupment amendmentinvolves at least a constructive withdrawal of funds from the unemploymentcompensation fund for a purpose other than the payment of unemploymentcompensation or one allowed by existing statutory exceptions. The violationoccurs because the recoupment amendment allows the State not to pay whendue all benefits to which a claimant is entitled by right because of hisunemployed status. The cause of such nonpayment is the application of criteriawhich purport to modify the unemployed claimant's entitlement by reasonof circumstances not related to his unemployed status. That is sufficientto disqualify the recoupment amendment for certification, under andSection;3302(a)(1) of FUTA, regardless of whether withholding such moneys constitutesa technical withdrawal from Minnesota's unemployment compensation fund.However, Minnesota's assertion that withholding benefits in conformitywith the recoupment amendment does not involve a withdrawal from the unemploymentcompensation fund cannot, in any event, be reconciled with subdivision2 of the recoupment amendment. That provision explicity mandates that ``[a]nyamounts deducted and withheld under this section <T3>shall be treated as if paid to the individual as benefits and paidby the individual to the department </T3>in satisfaction of the individual'sdelinquent contributions. * * *'' (Emphasis supplied.) Thus, the recoupmentamendment explicitly provides for a technical withdrawal from the fundfor the unauthorized purpose of recovering the unpaid contributions ofan employer. <ITAG tagnum="81">The Legislative History Reinforces the Plain Meaning of the FederalStatutory Provisions</ITAG>A strict and literal interpretation of the applicable statutory languageto preclude exceptions to the basic restriction upon use of moneys fromState unemployment compensation funds for other than timely payment ofunemployment compensation is reinforced by the legislative history of therelevant unemployment legislation. The Federal requirements at issue wereenacted as a part of the Social Security Act of 1935. The impetus for theSocial Security Act was the Committee on the Economic Security, establishedby President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Committee recommended a programof unemployment compensation as a ``valuable first line of defense for* * * [a worker] ordinarily steadily employed. Unemployment compensationshould permit such a worker, who becomes unemployed, to draw a cash benefitfor a limited period during which there is expectation that he will soonbe reemployed. This should be a contractual right not dependent on anymeans test.'' Report of the Committee on Economic Security, Hearings onS. 1130 Before the Senate Committee on Finance, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 1311,1321 (1935). During the Senate debate on the passage of the Social Security Act, theoriginal sponsor, Senator Wagner, stated that the ``only important requirement[of the Social Security Act] is that the State law shall be genuinely protective,and that its revenues shall be devoted exclusively to the payment of insurancebenefits.'' 79 Cong. Rec. 9284 (June 14, 1935); <T3>see also </T3>79 Cong. Rec. 9271 (June 14, 1935) (remarks of Sen. Harrison).Diversion of such payments to discharge preexisting private debts of anunemployed claimant, even to a public entity, is manifestly inconsistentwith such purposes and requirements. There is thus no basis for a broador flexible interpretation of the Federal statutory language in issue,and the argument of Minnesota to the contrary must be rejected. Conclusions of Law1. The Secretary has satisfied the requirements of 20 CFR andSection; 601.5for reasonable notice to the responsible state agency, the Minnesota Departmentof Jobs and Training, and opportunity for hearing following reasonableefforts by regional and central office representatives of the Secretaryto resolve with appropriate officials of Minnesota the issues subject todetermination in this proceeding. 2. Section 303(a)(5) of SSA requires that the Minnesota unemployment compensationlaw, in order to be in conformity with Federal standards, provide for the``[e]xpenditure of all money withdrawn from the [the State's] unemploymentfund * * * in the payment of unemployment compensation. * * *'' Similarly,sec. 3304(a)(4) of FUTA requires that the Minnesota law, in order to bein conformity with Federal standards, provide that ``all money withdrawnfrom the unemployment fund of the State shall be used solely in the paymentof unemployment compensation.'' A State statute authorizing the reductionby the State of benefits otherwise due in order to apply the amount ofsuch reduction to an independent debt of the claimant to an agency of theState is inconsistent with these provisions. 3. Section 303(a)(1) of SSA requires that the Minnesota law, in order tobe in conformity with Federal standards, provide for ``methods of administration* * * to be reasonably calculated to insure full payment of unemploymentcompensation when due.'' Compensation, as defined in section 3306(h) ofFUTA means ``cash benefits payable to individuals with respect to theirunemployment.'' The only exceptions to the general restriction limitingwithdrawals from the unemployment fund to use only for the payment of unemploymentcompensation benefits are those explicitly authorized or required by Federalstatute, such as the authorization for recovery of benefit overpaymentspursuant to sections 303(a)(5) and 303(g) of SSA. The Minnesota recoupmentamendment authorizes a method of administration which allows moneys otherwisepayable from the State's unemployment compensation fund for unemploymentbenefits to be diverted and applied to curtail preexisting and independentobligations to the fund, a State agency. Such administration of the fundis tantamount to allowing a levy or attachment of the claimant's unemploymentbenefits and is inconsistent with the standards prescribed by sections303(a)(1) and 303(a)(5) of SSA and the definition in section 3306(h) ofFUTA. 4. The legislative history relating to these statutory provisions supportsthe Secretary's interpretation of the relevant statutes and establishesthat the intent of Congress in enacting the Federal requirement was toinsure that all moneys committed by the State for unemployment compensationpurposes would be used, subject only to certain specifically authorizedexceptions, solely for the payment of benefits and that individuals wouldbe entitled to full payment of benefits as a matter of right after beingdetermined to be eligible. 5. The Federal requirements have consistently been interpreted by the Secretaryto limit withdrawals from the unemployment fund to insure that such withdrawalswould be expended solely for the payment of unemployment compensation benefits.The only exceptions to this limitation which have been and are deemed validby the Secretary have been those specifically authorized or required byFederal statute. 6. Since the applicable provisions of the SSA and FUTA do not provide forthe exercise of discretion in the application of moneys for the unemploymentcompensation fund to unemployment benefits by the Secretary or any otherauthority, only Congress has the authority to authorize or require exceptionsto the general withdrawal standard by legislative action. No Federal existinglaw has been cited or discovered which gives the Secretary authority toapprove an attempted exercise of such authority by any state on policygrounds or otherwise create, or permit to the created, any exception tothe limitation applicable to the expenditure of moneys in the state's unemploymentcompensation fund. 7. In the absence of authority to create exceptions to the limitationsupon the uses of moneys in Minnesota's unemployment compensation fund,the policy considerations alleged to justify the Minnesota recoupment laware irrelevant to this proceeding. 8. Since the recoupment amendent provides that Minnesota may deduct andwithhold up to 50 percent of each unemployment compensation payment toan individual for unpaid contributions, interest, penalties, and costswhich the individual owed as an employer, the recoupment amendment conflictswith the requirements of sections 303(a)(1) and 303(a)(5) of SSA and section3304(a)(4) of FUTA. The legal effect of the Minnesota statute is to allowMinnesota to apply moneys from the unemployment fund, not to pay unemploymentcompensation benefits, but to pay unpaid contributions, interest, penaltiesand costs for which the individual is liable as an employer. Thus, theunemployed claimant does not receive full payment of benefits to whichthe individual is entitled with respect to his unemployment at the timethose benefits are due. 9. Minnesota's withholding of unemployment benefits to which a claimantwould otherwise be entitled by reason of his unemployment, and the applicationof those moneys to curtail in whole or in part an alleged debt of thatclaimant in his individual or private capacity to the State's unemploymentcompensation fund, a public entity, constitutes a constructive or technicalwithdrawal from the fund, even though the fund retains such moneys as theultimate recipent and beneficiary. However, even if such an applicationof moneys from the fund were not deemed technically to be a withdrawalfrom Minnesota's unemployment compensation fund within the meaning of section303(a)(5) of SSA and section 3304(a)(4) of FUTA, recoupment amendment authorizesand expenditure from the Minnesota unemployment fund to pay other thanunemployment compensation (or administrative costs) in violation of section303(a)(5) of SSA and section 3304(a)(4) of FUTA. It thus violates the requirementfor administration insuring full payment of unemployment compensation whendue within the meaning of section 303(a)(1) of SSA, and it applies criteriafor payment of benefits other than the claimant's unemployment contraryto the definition in section 3306(b) of FUTA. In effect, it is tantamountto a levy or attachment of unemployment benefits that a claimant wouldotherwise be entitled to receive in frustration of the fundamental purposeof the unemployment compensation statutes. 10. Because of the enactment and continuing effect of the recoupment amendment,Minn. Stat. andSection;268.165 (1987 Supp.), the Minnesota unemployment compensationlaw is not in conformity with applicable Federal law, with respect to certificationpursuant to sections 3302(a), 3302(b), and 3304(c) of FUTA or certifiedas provided in section 3303(b) of FUTA. 11. Because of the enactment and continuing effect of the recoupment amendment,Minn. Stat. andSection;268.165 (1987 Supp.), the Minnesota unemployment compensationlaw does not include certain specified provisions as required by sections303(a)(1) and 303(a)(5) of SSA, it is not in conformity with the requirementsof that law with respect to certification for purposes of grants or paymentof funds to Minnesota in accordance with section 302(a) of SSA and 20 C.F.R.andSection;andSection;601.3, 601.5(a) (1) and (2).<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 14, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward Terhune Miller, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Administrative Law Judge. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-12718 Filed 5-26-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-30-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
