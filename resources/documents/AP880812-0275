ATandamp;T said the system would cost $8.9 million, including freetraining, and would be ideal for customers such as airlines andcompanies in the process industries, such as oil, chemicals andpaper.   The Karmarkar algorithm greatly speeds up the solution ofmathematical problems that involve the interaction of thousands ofvariables. It was originally used to help ATandamp;T plan the growth ofits phone network.   ATandamp;T said an airline, for example, could use the system toimprove the efficiency of its routing system, including thescheduling and allocation of planes and crews. Chemical companiescould use it to balance the input of raw materials and the outputof final products, ATandamp;T said.   The system, known as Korbx, is being offered by a new ATandamp;T unit,Advanced Decision Support Systems, based in Whippany, N.J. Somesystems, but fewer than 10, have been sold, said the new unit'spresident, Aristides Fronistas.   The Karmarkar algorithm traces a path inside the ``region'' ofall potential solutions to a problem until it arrives at the bestone. An algorithm is simply a rule of thumb, or a special methodfor solving a certain kind of problem.   Bell Laboratories received three patents related to the Korbxsystem in May.</TEXT></DOC>
