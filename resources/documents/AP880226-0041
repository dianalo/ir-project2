HIGGINS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. officials will visit Portugal next weekto talk about giving the Portuguese surplus American militaryequipment as a means of offsetting budget cuts in military aid, theState Department says.   Gen. Charles Brown, chief of the Defense Security AssistanceAgency, will head the delegation leaving next Monday for Portugalto talk about what kind of military equipment the United Statescould provide.   The United States has suggested giving Portugal surplusequipment to make up for budget cuts that have forced a reductionin aid below levels promised under a 1983 agreement allowing theU.S. military to use bases in Portugal.   The announcement Thursday came a day after Portuguese PrimeMinister Anibal Cavaco Silva met with President Reagan to complainabout the lower aid levels and call for a formal review of thebases agreement.   ``Portugal wants the military bases to continue,'' Cavaco Silvareiterated in a speech on Thursday to the National Press Club,``and we don't want to reduce the American facilities in Portugal.''   ``Our decision is a result of difference in interpretation ofour mutual agreement, and we don't want that this point of frictionwill continue until 1991,'' he said. ``That is the end of thisagreement.''   The agreement, an extension of an original pact stemming from1951, ``is out of date,'' Cavaco Silva said.   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said U.S. officialswere pleased that Cavaco Silva didn't want a reduction in Americanmilitary presence in Portugal, unlike the insistence of neigboringSpanish officials that the United States remove F-16s that had beenbased in Spain.</TEXT></DOC>
