The report, which comes 25 years after the first surgeongeneral's report on smoking, also cites cigarette smoking as thecause for nine out of 10 lung cancer deaths among women, thenewspaper said.   Other conclusions in the report by Dr. C. Everett Koop are thatlung cancer now surpasses breast cancer as the leading cancer killeramong women, 43 chemicals in tobacco are now confirmed as cancercausing and smoking is a major cause of cerebral vascular disease.   Koop's increase in his estimate of smoking-related deaths from300,000 annually is due to more accurate accounting rather than morelethal cigarettes, The Monitor said in a release it distributed twodays before the report was to have been made public.   Koop estimates that 50 million Americans still smoke, thenewspaper said.   Children, especially girls, are smoking at younger ages, theMonitor quoted the report as saying, with 80 percent of smokers bornsince 1935 starting before the age of 21, despite state agerestrictions on the purchase of cigarettes.   However, Koop found that in 1987, nearly half of all adults whohad smoked had quit, with the trend particularly true among men.   Before the report was issued, the Tobacco Institute began acampaign in newspapers around the country. In ads headlined,``Enough is enough,'' the institute said the results of a nationwidepoll it commissioned shows that the majority of Americans do notwant an increase in cigarette taxes, more smoking bans or theelimination of cigarette advertising.</TEXT></DOC>
