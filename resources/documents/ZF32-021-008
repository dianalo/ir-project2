 AFS currently runswith transmission control protocol/internet protocol-based Unixsystems on LANs and WANs.andP;  AFS is supported by large companiestoday, including DEC, HP and IBM, all of whom plan to produce DCEproducts to help the AFS market.andP;  However, the technology stillcannot connect microcomputers across a WAN on an AFS server.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   AFS (Computer network software) (Usage)Distributed Computing Environment (Program development software)(Computer programs).andO;Topic:     Local Area NetworksWide Area NetworksNetwork SoftwareProgram Development SoftwareMarket AnalysisTrendsConnectivityOpen Software Foundation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>AFS AND WIDE-AREA FILESYSTEMSandM;In computers, everything either scales up or scales down.andP;  Networks, chips,processor architectures - they either get bigger or get smaller.andP;  So it isonly logical that the capabilities we now take for granted on LANs win soonbe available on WANs.andM;With technologies such as VMS' RMS, file transfers among machines on LANsgave way to file and record s@ and locking.andP;  Now, the same is occurring onthe WAN.andP;  The big difference, however, is that today these capabilities arestandards-based and do not exist exclusively in the proprietary realm.andM;When OSF's Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) becomes widely availablenext year, many distributed LAN-based capabilities will become available onWANs.andP;  Digital has slated both VMS and ULTRIX for DCE compliance.andP;  SomeLAN-based capabilities, such as NCS RPCs, X.500 naming and Kerberos security,are already at work to some degree on a variety of educational and researchWANs.andP;  But it is the Andrew File System (AFS) that is finding the highestdegree of implementation as a component of DCE.andP;  So far, there are only about130 AFS sites, but these include some of the largest networks in the world.andM;AFS is available for use with TCP/IP-based UNIX systems on LANs and WANs, andit provides a migration path to DCE.andP;  Under funding from IBM, AFS wasdeveloped at Carnegie-Mellon University.andP;  Around the time OSF chose AFS as acomponent of DCE, some of the developers left Carnegie-Mellon and foundedTransarc.andP;  When AFS became commercially available from Transarc in 1990, thefilesystem received a cool reception, since Sun Microsystems' Network FileSystem (NFS) was already the de facto standard for filesharing on LANs.andP;  AFSwas designed from the ground up for wide-area use, so it had to wait untilthe WAN marketplace matured a bit before finding its market.andP;  Now, with thebacking of Digital, Hewlett-Packard and IBM, which all have big plans forDCE, the market is finally opening up for AFS.andM;You can easily determine whether you are on a machine that is using AFS:Simply change directory to the top of the filesystem and look for a directorycalled &quot;afs.&quot; If the site is hooked into the global afs namespace, you canthen descend into filesystems all over the world from the afs directory.andP;  Ifyou are registered as a user with the Kerberos system in use at the site thatyou have wandered into, then you may use the files to which Kerberos grantsyou access.andM;According to Alfred Spector, president and CEO of Transarc and a formerassociate professor of Computer Science at CarnegieMellon, AFS represents anew approach to information sharing.andP;  &quot;Organizations have widened their viewof the world and their expectations for collaborative work to include sitesanywhere in the world,&quot; Spector says.andP;  &quot;AFS supports this view by removingthe distinction between local and remote file access.&quot;andM;Because of the access latencies that you find across WANs, it is not yetreasonable to view wide-area filesystems in the same light as localfilesystems.andP;  But with technologies such as fractional T1, frame relay,broadband ISDN and SONET coming quickly, wide-area record sharing and &quot;livelinks&quot; among documents shared across the wide area become realities.andM;However, besides latencies in the network, there are still major obstaclesstanding in the way of wide-area filesystem implementation.andP;  According toGreg Kenley, chief technology officer at Epoch Systems, a manufacturer ofhigh-capacity fileservers, you rarely see filesystems extending beyond theLAN.andP;  &quot;The biggest problem,&quot; says Kenley, &quot;is that filesystems vary widely.andO;You can't put an AFS server on a PC, yet connecting PCs across wide-areanetworks is one of the most important capabilities customers are lookingfor.&quot;andM;Kenley adds that AFS has made inroads where large organizations need toconnect TCP/IP-based UNIX systems across the wide area, like supercomputersand machines used by researchers working at many different institutions.andP;  ButAFS has a hard sell in corporate America.andP;  &quot;We're selling our servers not somuch because of the part they play in the filesystem, but because they backup all the different types of machines on the network, regardless ofoperating system or networking protocol,&quot; Kenley says.andM;Transarc, however, is counting on widespread implementation of DCE to get AFSinto corporate America.andP;  Transarc has gone to great lengths to provide AFSinteroperability with NFS client systems, so AFS can be used along with themany UNIX and nonUNIX client systems (including PCs) on which NFS has beenimplemented.andP;  The company, however, has no intention of actively attemptingto make AFS available across this large number of platform.andM;Other marketing schemes, such as working with DARPA to build a wide-areafilesystem that eventually could encompass as many sites as Internet, are thepreferred approach of the people at Transarc.andP;  The company has set up a localfilesystem called grand.central.org that is providing some DARPA client-onlysites with file services.andP;  The local filesystem (or cell) is also acting as acentral repository for information that any AFS site can access.andM;About one-third of the roughly 130 AFS sites are participating in the AFSglobal file space.andP;  Each site provides certain site-specific information toTransarc, and the company keeps this information in a central file for allAFS sites to access.andP;  AFS sites can choose to mount some or all of theseexternal sites, making them viewable in an &quot;ls&quot; of  /afs.&quot;andM;AFS uses the concept of cells to implement wide-area filesystems.andP;  A cell isa local-area filesystem that can be recognized by its network address in thepathname.andP;  For example, in the pathname  &quot;/afs/ andrew.cmu.edu/usr/abc,&quot; theAFS cell at Carnegic-Mellon is connected into the global /afs namespace.andP;  AFSvolume mount points, unlike NFS mount points, are filesystem objects, so auser sees the entire global filesystem regardless of where he is within it.andM;Another important aspect of AFS wide-area filesystem technology is theability to cache data and directory information locally to ensure goodperformance.andP;  With AFS, entire files may be replicated if required, and&quot;callbacks&quot; are used to ensure that file writes occur to all existing copiesof the file on the network.andP;  Replication of directories, data and files on anumber of servers provides increased performance and immunity to filesystemor network failures.andM;Work is also proceeding to develop network protocols that minimize accesslatencies and maximize data transfer bandwidth.andP;  Together with fasterhardware and high-speed digital links among LANs, wide-area filesystems basedon AFS could very well be part of your computing future.andP;  - Bradford T.andO;Harrison, Networking Editor</TEXT></DOC>
