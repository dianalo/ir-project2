(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Reliability is the key to picking the right router.andP;  We tested the fiveLocalTalk-toLocalTalk routers on the market; here are our picks.andM;Imagine that you are one of 50 callers on a conference call.andP;  According toprotocol, only one person talks atandM;a time, no one monopolizes the call, and everyone waits until a pause in theconversation before saying anything.andP;  Now imagine a second conference call,not directly connected to the first.andP;  To speak with someone on the otherconference call, you have to go through some kind of switching device thatcan bridge the gap between the two conference calls and forward messagesbetween them.andM;AppleTalk works in much the same way.andP;  Each &quot;conference call&quot; is a network.andO;Each person oil the call is a node a computer, a printer, or another networkdevice.andP;  The AppleTalk protocols define the rules by which nodes communicatewith each other.andP;  Data packets are the &quot;conversation&quot;on the line.andP;  And abridge, or router, acts like a switch that connects two networks.andM;Strictly speaking, bridges and routers serve different functions.andP;  Thedistinction between the two, however, is a rather subtle one and is beyondthe scope of this article.andP;  More important is the fact that, in AppleTalknetworks, there are no &quot;true&quot; bridges.andP;  All the switching devices that arecommonly called bridges are really routers.andM;An AppleTalk router straddles two networks; listens to both of them; and, ifappropriate, forwards messages between them.andP;  A router does not forwardmessages if the conversation is just among nodes on the same network.andP;  Notforwarding messages unnecessarily is called traffic isolation, and it is themain function of an AppleTalk router.andP;  It reduces overall network traffic byrestricting certain data packets to only part of the internet.andP;  (All internetis a megaiietwork comprising two or more smaller subnetworks.)andM;A router cannot speed up your total network throughput - aLocalTalk-toLocalTalk router, for example, cannot make a LocalTalk networktransfer data faster than its specified rate of 230.4 kilobits per second -but by isolating traffic within small subnetworks, routers can reduce thetraffic in each subnet.andP;  That speeds up the effective performance of thenetwork by dividing it into parts.andP;  Each work group has less traffic andtherefore fewer collisions - as long as users don't cross the bridge toooften.andM;TO Route 0r not to RouteandM;The most common mistake involving AppleTalk routers is installing them wherethey are unnecessary.andP;  Suppose you have a single network with 20 users andone file server (see Figure la).andP;  Let's say everyone is constantly trying touse the file server, so each node theoretically gets three minutes of accessto the file server per hour.andM;You see an advertisement that says, &quot;Speed up your network with an AcmeSuperBridge!&quot; You buy one and install the Acme router, which splits yournetwork into two smaller subnets.andP;  You and half of the other users are now ona new network, on one side of the router.andP;  Everyone else and the serverremain on the old network, on the other side of the router.andP;  Things shouldspeed up significantly, you think to yourself, since each network is nowhandling only half the traffic.andM;Wrong.andP;  For those on the old network with the server, things do improve.andO;Since there are now only ten nodes on that network, each node (one of whichis the router) gets an average of six minutes of server access per hour,instead of the previous three minutes.andP;  They're the lucky ones.andP;  But as faras the server is concerned, the router is just another network node, one outof ten.andP;  The server doesn't know that there are ten more users sitting on theother side of the router.andP;  Everyone on the new network, on your side of therouter, must now share the router's six minutes per hour of server accesstime.andP;  Since you are one of the unfortunate ones who has to go through therouter to get at the server, you now get access for only about 30 seconds -1/10 of six minutes - per hour.andP;  For you and for all the other users, youraccess to the file server has now been drastically reduced (see Figure 1b).andM;So when should you install a router? Install a router only if you havedistinct work groups that do not regularly share network resources with usersin another work group.andP;  Network resources include such things as fileservers, mailservers, and printers.If slow printing is your main problem, themost cost-effective solution may be simply to add a print spooler to yournetwork.andP;  If that doesn't do the trick, consider whether you can subdividethe users on your network into work groups - each work group will become itsown subnetwork -and give each group its own file server, mail server, andprinter.andP;  Then use routers to interconnect the work groups so that users onone network can send mail to, share files with, and print to a printer onanother network.andM;But make sure not to put people on the &quot;other side&quot; of a router from aprinter or server that they access regularly.andP;  (Remember thefour-second-per-hour nightmare.) If most users can access their primarynetwork services without communicating through a router, the routers arebeing used correctly, and everyone will have timely access to the resourcesthey need.andM;Hardware and Software OptionsandM;Routers can connect many kinds of AppleTalk networks, including LocalTalk,Ethernet, Arcnet, broadband/video, and (probably by the time you read this)Token Ring.andP;  The kinds of networks you are connecting will determine whattype of router you should use.andP;  For example, if your company has an existingToken Ring network and you want to connect a LocalTalk work group of Macs toit, you will need a LocalTalk-to-Token Ring router.andP;  This article covers onlyLocalTalk-to-LocalTalk routers.andM;A LocalTalk router can be implemented in either hardware or software.andP;  Ahardware router is a specialized hardware box with the LocalTalk-routersoftware built into its ROM.andP;  Updating a hardware router usually requiresreplacing the ROM chips, which your dealer or vendor may have to do for you.andO;Software routers run on a Macintosh.andP;  In a way they are an extension ofsystem software.andP;  This software can be quickly, easily, and inexpensivelyupdated by use of a floppy disk.andP;  Although a software product can be quicklyupdated, hardware routers certainly have their advantages.andP;  The chances areslim, for instance, that someone will accidentally crash a hardware router -or take it home for the weekend.andM;For this article, we tested the five LocalTalk routers currently on themarket: Hayes' InterBridge, Nuvotech's TurboBridge, Shiva's NetBridge,Solana's I-Server (all hardware), and version 2.0 of Infosphere's Liaison (asoftware router; version 1.0 was reviewed in the April '89 Bridges section).andM;ReliabilityandM;You wouldn't drive your car over a bridge that failed &quot;only&quot; once a week, andyou shouldn't trust your company network to a router that fails only once aweek either.andP;  Total reliability is more important than speed or cost.andO;Failure or bad behavior from the device that controls user access to preciousnetwork resources is simply not acceptable.andM;To test reliability, we configured all five LocalTalk routers and attachedthem to the MacUser network for several days.andP;  Of the five routers tested,the Solana IServer (ROM version 1.050) and Nuvotech's TurboBridge (ROMversion 33.15A) had obvious routing-table problems (see Figure 2).andP;  When wewere using the TurboBridge, the Chooser showed each zone name three times.andO;(Nuvotech is aware of this problem but couldn't say when it would be fixed.)andO;The I-Server worked fine for awhile but then added some garbage zone names tothe zone list.andP;  Solana said that the 1Server likes to control zone names on anetwork and that when a Liaison user on the same internal tries to reset zonenames that an I-Server has already established, the I-Server gets unhappy.andP;  Afix - which will entail a ROM replacement-should be available by the time youread this.andM;But until these problems are solved, we do not recommend either of theseproducts.andP;  Remember, with routers, reliability comes first.andM;The InterBridge (ROM version 1.12), NetBridge (ROM version 1.02), and Liaison(version 2.0) routers worked correctly, even when the others were providingincorrect information.andM;Message-Forwarding SpeedandM;The primary function of a router is to isolate traffic, but it should alsoforward messages as quickly as possible.andP;  To test throughput, we compared thetime required to copy a file from a node to a server on the same network withthe time it took to copy the same file from the same node to the same serverrelocated to the other side of the router (see Figure 3).andP;  We ran both testswith two additional nodes generating a constant amount of background traffic.andO;Because Liaison is a software router, you can choose between running it on aMac dedicated to Liaison alone or as a background process.andP;  In backgroundmode, you can run it behind a Mac acting as either a workstation or as anAppleShare server.andP;  We tested it in both stand-alone mode on a Mac Plus andrunning behind a Mac 11 workstation being used for heavy foreground wordprocessing.andM;Liaison (running on a dedicated Mac Plus) and the TurboBridge were thefastest packet forwarders, adding a delay of only 35 percent to the local file-transfer time.andP;  Liaison running in the background on a Mac II and theNetBridge added a delay of 45 percent.andP;  (Liaison running on a dedicated II or'030 machine would be even faster.) The InterBridge added a delay of 75percent, and the I-Server added a 100-percent delay.andP;  So of the three routersfound to be reliable, Liaison was the fastest, followed by the NetBridge,which was the fastest hardware router.andM;Configuration SoftwareandM;To do its job, a router must first be configured.andP;  When you configure arouter, you typically assign a zone name and network number for each of itsLocalTalk ports.andP;  In some cases you can let the router assign its own namesand numbers.andP;  The InterBridge, TurboBridge, NetBridge, and I-Server all comewith standalone configuration applications.andP;  Liaison is configured from theChooser.andP;  If you don't know what you're doing, router-configuration softwarewon't be as intuitive as a spreadsheet or a word processor.andP;  The manuals forall five of the routers we tested provide comprehensible instructions thatlead you through the configurationprocess.andP;  Of these five manuals, Liaison'sis the best.andM;The configuration software that comes with NetBridge, Liaison, andInterBridge shows routing-table status information that can be useful fortroubleshooting a network containing several routers.andP;  The Shiva InternetManager software has excellent online help, and it can help you configure andobtain diagnostic information on Hayes InterBridges as well as on ShivaNetBridges.andP;  Unfortunately, Hayes' InterBridge Manager software (version1.0D) is not fully compatible with the currently shipping MacSystem andFinder (System Software 6.0.3).andP;  It can hang if you're using MultiFinder withanother program running in the background.andP;  You can avoid the problem by notrunning under MultiFinder when you run InterBridge Manager; by starting LIPyour Mac from the InterBridge Manager disk that Hayes provides, which has anolder System and Finder on it; or - if you have it - by using the Shivasoftware instead, which is compatible with current System software.andP;  Hayessays it is now shipping version 1.0E of InterBridge Manager, which fixes theproblem.andP;  Current InterBridge owners can call Hayes for a free upgrade.andM;Special FeaturesandM;Half-Bridging.andP;  With half-bridges, you can configure your network so thatfrom Seattle you can print to a LaserWriter in New York and access a mailserver in Dallas.andP;  Although we did not test halfbridging, both InterBridgeand Liaison can be used as half-bridges to connect to remote AppleTalknetworks through dialup modems.andP;  In addition, Shiva and Solana offer separatehalf-bridge devices.andM;Configuration Passwords.andP;  Liaison, NetBridge, and I-Server can be configuredwith password protection so that curious,(or malicious) network users cannotreconfigure a network,andM;Hidden Zones.andP;  Liaison, NetBridge, I-Server, and TurboBridge can hide certainzones from selected network users.andP;  This feature can be very useful when yournetwork contains dial-in AppleTalk modems - or when pranksters are constantlypi-inting to the big boss's LaserWriter,andM;Other Networks.andP;  Liaison can be used as a LocalTalk-to-EtherTalk orLocalTalk-to-Arcnet router instead of as a LocalTalk-to-LocalTalk router.andP;  Itcan also serve as a gateway between LocalTalk and Token Ring networks, usingApple's new TokenTalk card and software(which should be avai Table by thetime you read this).andM;RecommendationsandM;If you are certain that a router is, indeed, the solution to your networkproblem, remember that reliability comes first, Speed will most likely beyour second consideration.andP;  Cost and additional features should probably beyour lowest priorities (although the dial-in capability offered byInterBridge and Liaison could be a critical factor for some .andM;The Hayes InterBridge is the oldest, most experienced LocalTalk router.andO;Although it is also the most expensive $799) and far from the fastest, it hasa proven track record.andP;  An InterBridge doesn't break.andP;  In addition, thisrouter comes with built-in half-bridging,andM;Infosphere's Liaison ($295) is also highly reliable when used on a dedicatedmachine or run in the background behind a server.andP;  However, don't try to runit as a LocalTalk-to-LocalTalk router on an individual user's workstation;you'll be asking for trouble.andP;  Like InterBridge, Liaison also can be used forhalf-bridging, and it provides many useful security features.andP;  It is fast,and, if you have a spare Mac Plus sitting around or run the program in thebackground on an AppleShare server, it's the least expensive.andP;  If you'vepurchased a dedicated Macintosh on which to run it, however, Liaison is themost expensive option.andM;The Shiva NetBridge ($499) is faster and less expensive than the InterBridge,and, although we've heard complaints about NetBridges with older ROMs causingproblems, our tests showed ROM version 1.03 to be reliable.andP;  The NetBridgecomes with very nice configuration software.andP;  It is solidly recommended forthose who want a hardware router.andM;Because the TurboBridge ($499) and I-Server ($695) are not 100-percentreliable, we do not recommend them at this time.andM;Product Directory   InterBridge Hayes Microcomputer Products, Inc.andP;

 Unlessyour Macintoshes are connected to a large corporate Ethernet or Token Ringinternet, you don't need to worry about Phase 2 yet.andP;  But as Phase l isphased out, you will probably want to upgrade.andP;  All the vendors mentioned inthis article will be coming out with Phase 2 upgrades to their products.andO;Here are the details:andM;Hayes InterBridgeandM;Hayes has announced InterBridge 2.0 ($799), due out by the time you readthis.andP;  Factory-installed upgrades for version 1.0 owners will be availablefor $50 (or, for units purchased after June 12, 1989, free).andM;Infosphere LiaisonandM;Infosphere is shipping a new version of Liaison ($295) that supports bothPhase 1 and Phase 2 networks and includes automatic tools for making themigration.andP;  Upgrades will be free to those who purchased Liaison within 90days of the new version's initial shipping date; it will cost $50 for thosewho bought the product earlier.andM;Nuvotech TurboBridgeandM;Nuvotech will maintain two separate products for now, a Phase 1 router and aPhase 2 version.andP;  The Phase 2 router ($499) and a Phase-l-to-Phase-2upgrade(which willrequ ire a ROM changefor a &quot;nominal charge&quot;) should be availableby the time you read this.andM;Shiva NetBridgeandM;A Phase 2-compatible NetBridge should also be available when you read this,for the same price($499) as the Phase I unit.andP;  Shiva will offer a singleproduct that intelligently determines whether it should act as a Phase 1 orPhase 2 router.andP;  For $100, current NetBridge owners can upgrade to Phase 2.andO;The price includes new ROMs, software, and documentation.andM;Solana I-ServerandM;Solana, like Shiva, plans to offer a single product ($695) that can serve aseither a Phase 1 or Phase 2 router.andP;  The new router and a &quot;nominal charge&quot;upgrade, which will require a ROM change, should be available in September.andM;Apple AppleTalk Internet RouterandM;Apple's own Phase 2 offering is the AppleTalk Internet Router, a Mac softwarepackage to handle Token Ring, Ethernet, and LocalTalk gateways.andP;  Slated forrelease in &quot;summer 1989&quot; (which means your guess is as good as mine), it willcost $399.andM;Bridges will offer more information about Phase 2 products and strategies for&quot;making the migration&quot; as it becomes available.andP;  Next month, look for anin-depth report on what's new in Phase 2 and how it will affect your network.andM;- Henry Bortman</TEXT></DOC>
