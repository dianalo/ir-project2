To state that the U.S. standard of livingdeclined in 1990 is to attribute accuracy to data that isfunny. According to OECD data, the U.S. produced $18,339 ingross domestic product per capita, using 1985 prices and 1985purchasing power parities.   In the year 1990 it was $18,358. The differences betweenthe 1989 figure and the 1990 figure is 0.135%, or 13.5 tenthsof one percent. That is if you believe in such precision.</LP><TEXT>   I can look at the data in another and more meaningful way.In the year 1980, the difference between the U.S. standard ofliving and that of the European Economic Community was $5,548in favor of the U.S., as measured in GDP per capita in 1985prices and 1985 purchasing power parities.   In the year 1990 the difference between the U.S. standardof living and that of the EEC was $6,201 in favor of the U.S.The U.S. position of superiority over the EEC has increasedin terms of actual buying power. Since people spend dollars(or their equivalent) and do not spend percentages, this isthe relevant measure.   Your source is trying to sell the idea of an incompetent,inefficient and non-competitive American economy for thebenefit of its members. Its data is suspect andtechnologically inferior.   Pierre A.
