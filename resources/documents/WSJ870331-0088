The White House is considering plans to dispatch to Baghdad the most senior U.S. official to visit the country in three decades. The possible visit by Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead is part of an overall strategy in the region of reassuring Arab countries that the U.S. is committed to protecting their security despite its ill-guided efforts to sell arms to Iran. This effort is encountering widespread skepticism in Arab capitals.    Mr. Whitehead is planning a trip to Europe toward the end of April and is considering tacking on a trip to Iraq. The idea is raising some opposition among those administration officials who want to keep options with Tehran open and hence suggest a more balanced course. Although the U.S. still is technically neutral in the war and has rebuffed a Jordanian request that it supply Baghdad with arms, top officials say Washington is clearly distancing itself from Iran while providing Iraq increased diplomatic and intelligence support.    A senior official says that activity also includes greater support for United Nations actions that would call for sanctions against any party that doesn't agree to a U.N.-brokered cease-fire -- a move clearly aimed at Iran. He made clear that the U.S. hadn't had any direct contact with Iran since last year.    &quot;We recognize the appearance we have been giving the Arab world that we appeared to be tilting not only toward Israel but also toward Iran,&quot; a senior administration official said. &quot;There was the feeling the U.S. was no longer providing them much support. We recognized the need to become more active.&quot;    A senior official stressed that the new U.S. stance doesn't mean that Washington wants Iraq to win a total military victory. The official U.S. policy is still that &quot;there should be no victor nor vanquished in the war,&quot; he said. &quot;The steps we have taken are designed to convince friends that our commitments can be counted on and to deter an expansion of the war,&quot; he explained.    The U.S. diplomatic effort also has included sending Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other Gulf countries this month to answer messages of concern about Iranian threats.    After the humiliating disclosures of its secret arms sales to Iran, the U.S. says it is reinvigorating its efforts to stop world-wide arms shipments to Tehran through its &quot;Operation Staunch.&quot; Administration officials also have asked Congress not to stand in the way of long-planned U.S. arms sales to Arab states that are in the pipeline.    However, that message of renewed support for Arab states hasn't always won a friendly response.    Kuwait has rebuffed a U.S. offer to escort its ships through the Persian Gulf after learning that Iran had Chinese Silkworm missiles that could be used against them. Some officials believe the U.S. would have been better advised to issue a general offer to protect ships in the Gulf instead of one Kuwait was forced to reject because of its desire not to offend Moscow, with whom it has good relations.    A senior U.S. official defended the move, saying that 60 of the 100 Iranian attacks on commercial vessels targeted Kuwait ships. He said the move, even if rebuffed by Kuwait, sent a message that the U.S. doesn't want Iran to win the war and won't allow the disruption of its friends' commerce. &quot;The threat has declined somewhat, but if it increases the Kuwaitis will turn to us,&quot; he said.    The administration is working to prevent Congress from further restricting its ability to sell arms to Arab states that request assistance. Some Democrats, backed by the Israeli lobby, want to amend this year's foreign aid bill to make sales to Arab states more difficult. The administration and defense companies are lobbying energetically against the proposal.    The proposed trip to Iraq is controversial for several reasons. Some U.S. officials worry that a Whitehead trip would represent too sharp a swing against Iran, which is still a vital strategic prize in the region. Opponents of such a trip also cite a consensus among intelligence experts that Iraq is still involved in supporting terrorists. They note that Baghdad sheltered Abu Abbas, the mastermind of the Achille Lauro hijacking, and others who are considered terrorists by the U.S. They also cite Iraqi ties to terrorists who have attacked American targets, including an attempt on the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon in 1986.    But proponents of a Whitehead trip say Iraq's support for terrorism is relatively minor, and that better relations with Washington have moderated Iraq's behavior considerably. They also express great bitterness toward Iran's playing the U.S. &quot;as suckers&quot; and doubt diplomatic initiatives could have any success with Tehran.    &quot;The opportunity isn't there from their side,&quot; a senior administration official said of Iran. &quot;We think they are still seeing what they can do to exploit the situation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
