The discovery recommendations in the Bush-Quayle packageare not identical to those proposed by the JudicialConference Advisory Committee; and, opposition to one doesnot imply opposition to the other. Beyond a statement ofbasic goals and objectives, the President's Council has notyet articulated specific recommendations on discovery, andconsequently LCJ has expressed no view on them. On the otherhand, the proposals of the Judicial Conference AdvisoryCommittee are very specific and LCJ has opposed only thoseparticular provisions that would seem to exacerbate ratherthen eliminate discovery excess and abuse. Since itsestablishment in 1985, LCJ has supported limiting discoveryabuse, since much of the increase in the cost of litigationis related to the use and abuse of discovery.</LP><TEXT>   {Discovery is a pretrial fact-finding process. Under theQuayle proposals, each party in a lawsuit would be requiredto give the other side the names and addresses of all personswith relevant information about a case and disclose thelocation of all pertinent documents. Refusals to comply wouldbe grounds for barring the offending party from obtainingadditional information.}   LCJ, a national coalition of defense trial lawyers andcorporate counsel, supports an array of civil-justice reformsdesigned to achieve fairness and cost-efficiency in thecivil-justice system. Overall, we are pleased that thePresident's Council on Competitiveness has focused neededattention on the topic of civil-justice reform, and we lookforward to assisting in the implementation of its proposals.
