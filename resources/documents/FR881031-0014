Samuel J. Holmes first described <T3>S. pacifica</T3> as <T3>Miersia pacifica</T3> in 1895. In 1900, Holmes erected a new genus,<T3>Syncaris,</T3> for the California atyids based on notable differencesin the chelae (pinchers) and rostrum (horn-shaped structure between theeyes). <T3>S. pacifica</T3> can be distinguished from <T3>Palaemonias,</T3> the only other atyid genus in the United States,by its well-developed stalked eyes. <T3>Palaemonias</T3> are blind and dwell in caves in the eastern UnitedStates. <T3>S. pacifica</T3> is the only surviving species in the genus <T3>Syncaris</T3>.Adults may reach 5 centimeters (cm) (2\1/2\ inches) in length. Nearly transparentin water, the adults appear out of water to be greenish-gray to almostblack with pale blue uropods (tail fins). An adult female lays relativelyfew eggs (50-70, Hedgpeth 1975; 100-120, Eng 1981). While she carries theeggs on her body for 8 to 9 months, slow overwintering development of theeggs occurs. During this period, many larvae die due to adult female deathand genetic or embryonic developmental problems. As a result, the numberof embryos emerging from the eggs during May are reduced typically by 50percent. During the first summer, larval growth is rapid, but sexual maturityis not reached until the second summer.The California freshwater shrimp is endemic to gentle gradient (less than1 percent), low elevation (below 115 meters (380 feet)), freshwater streamsin Marin, Napa, and Sonoma Counties, California. The species, a true freshwatershrimp, inhabits quiet portions of tree-lined streams with underwater vegetationand exposed tree roots. Once common in the three counties, <T3>S. pacifica</T3> now occurs only within restricted portions of 12 streams.It cannot tolerate salt or brackish water and does not occur in the intertidalreaches or estuarine areas of any of the streams (Born 1968, Hedgpeth 1968,and Li 1981). The shrimp's transparency, secretive habits, and rapid escapebehavior contribute to its obscurity and make it difficult to capture ordetect by the casual observer. The California Department of Fish and Game(CDFG) attributed the decline in shrimp populations primarily to degradationand loss of its habitat resulting from increased urbanization, overgrazing,agricultural development, dam construction, and water pollution (CDFG 1980).Essentially compatible with native fish species, <ITAG tagnum="54"/><T3>S. pacifica</T3> is threatened by the introduction of exotic predators,especially fishes of the sunfish family. Because of the species' low reproductivepotential, slow maturity, restricted distribution, and specialized habitatrequirements, <T3>S. pacifica</T3> is particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and predationby exotic species against which its natural defense mechanisms are ineffective.On June 4, 1974, the Service entered into a contract with the Sierra ClubFoundation to investigate the status of freshwater shrimps in Pacific drainages.A final report under this contract was submitted in September 1975 by Dr.Joel W. Hedgpeth. Dr. Hedgpeth concluded in his report that <T3>Syncaris pacifica</T3> had been extirpated in some streams and wasreduced in distribution and abundance in others. This report cited dredging,streambed gravel stockpiling, stream diversion, and building temporarysummer gravel dams on the Austin Creek system as the major factors responsiblefor the decline of the California freshwater shrimp. Larry Serpa (1985)reported the species inhabited eleven streams in the Russian River, SanFrancisco Bay, and other coastal drainages. These streams are East Austin,Salmon, Lagunitas, Big Austin, Sonoma, Huichica, Green Valley, Jonive,Walker, Yulupa, and Blucher. This survey included a total of 52 streamsin the three drainages. Bill Cox of CDFG (personal communication 1986)found shrimp in the Napa River near Calistoga. This finding increases thetotal number of streams in the area known to contain shrimp to 12 out ofthe 53 surveyed.The California freshwater shrimp was proposed as a threatened species onJanuary 12, 1977 in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (42 FR 2507). That proposal was withdrawn onDecember 10, 1979 (44 FR 70796), under a provision of the 1978 amendmentsto the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which required withdrawal of allpending proposals if they were not finalized within 2 years of the proposal.On March 23, 1980, the Service received from CDFG a series of annotatedmaps delineating the known, current distribution of the California freshwatershrimp. These maps summarize the distribution data collected by CDFG in1979 and 1980. Additional distributional data were received by the Servicefrom the CDFG on October 30, 1980. CDFG later sent to the Service detailedinformation on the distribution, life history, and status of the shrimpin 1981 (Eng 1981, Serpa 1985). These maps and additional data constitutesignificant new information on which to make a determination of endangeredstatus for the California freshwater shrimp.In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13254), the Serviceproposed the California freshwater shrimp as an endangered species. OnJune 8, 1987, a request for a public hearing on this proposal was receivedfrom S. Reid Gustafson, Vice President, Shea Homes, San Jose, California.On June 19, 1987, the Service extended the comment period, which originallyclosed June 22, 1987, to August 1, 1987, and gave notice of the publichearing (52 FR 23317). The Service held the public hearing on July 15,1987. On July 31, 1987, the Service extended the comment period an additional60 days to October 1, 1987 (52 FR 28680), to accommodate several requests.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations</ITAG>In the April 22, 1987, proposed rule and associated notifications, allinterested parties were requested to submit factual reports or informationthat might contribute to the development of a final rule. Appropriate Stateagencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations,and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Anewspaper notice was published in the <T3>San Francisco Chronicle/Examiner</T3> (July 9, 1987), <T3>Santa Rosa Democrat</T3> (July 10, 1987), <T3>Argus-Courier</T3> (July 10, 1987), and the <T3>Independent Journal</T3> (July 10, 1987), all of which invited generalpublic comment. A total of 49 written comments on the listing were receivedand 2 comments not pertaining to the listing. A total of 21 individualsattended the public hearing in Santa Rosa, California, on July 15, 1987,and 11 provided testimony. The two additional <T4>Federal Register</T4> notices extending the comment period and announcingthe public hearing were also published in the aforementioned four newspapersin June and July, respectively.During the comment period, totaling approximately 6 months, 49 commentson the listing were received. Of the 35 comments that were substantialand stated a position on listing, 18 (36.7 percent) supported the listingand 17 (34.7 percent) did not; 14 (38.6 percent) were nonsubstantive. Thesewritten comments and the nine statements presented at the public hearingare discussed below.Multiple comments from the same individual or entity are combined and regardedas one response.Support for the listing proposal was voiced by one State agency (CaliforniaDepartment of Fish and Game), seven conservation organizations (or branchesthereof), and 10 other interested parties.Opposing comments and other comments questioning the rule can be placedin a number of general groups. These categories of comments, and the Service'sresponse to each, are listed below.<T3>Comment 1: </T3>Several questions were raised pertaining to the availablebiological information on the shrimp. Have enough surveys been done todetermine that the shrimp does not occur in other streams in the area?What are its specific habitat requirements? Without complete informationon the above topics, is this listing premature?<T3>Service response: </T3>The Service finds that surveys since 1950 (testimonyof Dr. Hedgpeth at the public hearing) and the recent surveys (Hedgpeth,1968, 1975, Eng 1981, and Serpa 1986) of 53 streams in the area, includingthe historical locations of the shrimp, provide adequate information onthe distribution, habitat requirements, and threats to the species to warrantthe present action for the shrimp. Further studies on the distributionwould consume additional time during which the shrimp would not be protected.Further, because of the strict habitat requirements of the species, theshrimp is not likely to occur in other areas. In the Background, and FactorsAffecting the Species sections of this rule, the natural habitat and requirementsof the shrimp are described. Pertinent studies on the habitat requirementsof the shrimp are listed in the References Cited section of the proposedrule and the final rule. In some cases, the data were supplied by personalcommunications with field biologists and are so noted in the text.Under andSection; 424.11(b) of the regulations for listing endangered species(50 CFR Part 424), the Secretary shall make any determination solely onthe basis of the best available scientific and commercial information regardinga species' status, without reference to possible economic or other impactsof such determination. The State of California, recognizing the declinein the California freshwater shrimp, listed it as endangered in 1980. Thespecies continues to lose habitat and decline in distribution and populationsize. Therefore, based on the available information regarding the statusof the shrimp, the Service believes immediate listing is warranted.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>What is the difference between the two types of summerdams used in the area? What are the effects of the summer gravel dams aswell as gravel mining and removal on the shrimp and its habitat? It wassuggested that dams such as those built by the Cazadero Dam Committee (agroup of private citizens and property owners along the Austin Creek system)on the Austin Creek System in Sonoma County and the Giacomini Dam in Marincounty have actually helped the shrimp. Commenters stated the need fordams in the area to provide water for drinking, fire protection, and recreationduring the dry season.<T3>Service response: </T3>Presently, there are two methods of temporarysummer dam construction in those counties where shrimp are known to occur.One method, and probably the more damaging to the shrimp, is the practiceof using a bull-dozer or other earth-moving equipment to create a dam bypushing gravel from the streambed over culverts placed in the live stream.Flash boards may be placed over the opening of the culvert to regulatethe amount of water retained behind the structure. This method causes extensivesiltation downstream during the initial construcion period and later whenthe dam is washed out during the heavy rainstorms in the fall. Siltationchanges the substrate from gravel to fine silt. this silt suffocates thesource of food for the shrimp such as other small invertebrates and encrustingorganisms that live in the gravel substrate and on submerged rocks.The other method of temporary summer dam construction in this area is doneby placing permanent structures or abutments on opposite shores of thestreams and using a crane to suspend a movable bridge onto these structures.This temporary bridge is put in place during the spring or early summerand removed in the fall. This type of dam has no adverse affect on theshrimp because the aquatic habitat is not altered.The adverse effects of the summer gravel dams on the shrimp are summarizedunder section A of the Summary of Factors Affecting the Species in thefinal rule. Temporary dams constructed only of gravel destroy shrimp habitatin two ways. First, the dams are allowed to remain in the streams untilthe winter rains wash them out. This gravel is then carried downstreamand deposited in the undercut banks adversely affecting the essential habitatfor the shrimp. When streamflows are high during the winter and spring,<T3>Syncaris</T3> are found under submerged undercut banks where fine rootsextending into the water provide cover. In such a habitat, the shrimp aresheltered from the strong currents of winter flows. During the summer andfall when the streamflow is lower, the shrimp are associated with streamsidevegetation that extends into the water and provides shade as well as appropriatehiding places. These essential areas are degraded as habitat for the shrimpwhen they are filled with sand and gravel. Second, when the dams are inplace throughout the summer, a warm, long, narrow lake is created in whatwas once a cool stream environment. Because the feeding behavior and thermoregulatoryadaptations of the shrimp are specific to survival in a cool, slow-movingwater environment, they are not adapted to a warm, still water habitatand will eventually die if they cannot return to the cool stream environment.They do occur in deep cool pools in the stream. These dams also entrapa large number of aggressive, fast growing, exotic fish species which preyon the shrimp and other aquatic organisms.There is no evidence that the temporary summer gravel dams, such as thoseconstructed by the Cazadero Dam Committee, have helped the shrimp. Theshrimp habitat of East Austin Creek has been degraded by the dams to theextent that the present population of shrimp is discontinuously distributed.The shrimp population cannot maintain itself in the reaches of the streamwith dams without being replenished from small upstream refugia. Thesedams prevent the movement of shrimp from upstream refugia to downstreamfeeding, mating, and hiding sites.The Giacomini seasonal dam was placed in the intertidal zone in the lowerend of Lagunitas Creek in Marin County. This dam is nearly 10 miles downstreamfrom usable shrimp habitat and is not expected to affect this species becausethe shrimp cannot tolerate brackish water. As the dam has prevented theintrusion of brackish water into the creek, it has increased the upstreamusable habitat of the shrimp. There are no shrimp downstream of this damto be adversely affected by siltation during annual dam construction.Gravel and aggregate mining in the area has probably not harmed the shrimpsince it provides a means by which gravel washed downstream from the seasonaldams can be removed from the dry steambed without significantly causingsiltation. Gravel and aggregate mining is not done in the live stream andsorting, grading, and washing activities are done away from the stream.The tailings from this activity are placed in sediment ponds that do notallow effluent to enter the stream. Most of the damage to the shrimp habitatby gravel mining occurred prior to passage of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act in 1970 and subsequent environmental legislation which prohibitscertain activities in waterways. Present gravel and aggregate mining operationsare not known to disturb or damage shrimp habitat.<T3>Comment 3:</T3> Will the listing of the species mean an end to theconstruction of summer dams?<T3>Service response:</T3> Changes in the size, number, method of construction,and method of removal of summer recreational dams on the Austin Creek system,which includes Austin, Kidd, and East Austin Creeks, have been requiredthrough the Corps of Engineers permitting process. Only East Austin hasa population of shrimp, thus, only these dams may be affected by the listingthrough the Corps of Engineers permitting process.These dams change a cool, slow-moving stream into a warm, long, narrowlake which lacks pool/riffle areas and overhanging vegetation, essentialto the shrimp's survival. The present method of gravel dam removal (byletting the winter rains wash the dams out), is more harmful than the constructiontechnique of pushing the gravel up from the streambed into gravel dams.When dams wash out, the gravel and fine silt are deposited in the undercutbanks which are essential habitat for the shrimp (see comment 2). Presently,an experimental method of summer gravel dam construction is being triedunder a Corps of Engineers permit to the Cazadero Dam Committee. As a conditionof this permit, the present number (38) and size (5 to 8 feet high, approximately12 feet at the top, 26 feet wide at the bottom, and 55 feet long to extendacross the stream channel) of the dams on the Austin Creek system is tobe reduced over a 5-year period. The number of beaches also will be reduced.These conditions were placed on the Cazadero Dam Committee permit to upgradethe habitat for anadromous fish species and to avoid adverse impacts tothe shrimp in East Austin Creek. This new dam construction method involvesdigging a pit in the dry streambed and connecting the pit to the live streamby a culvert. Its impact on the shrimp habitat is not fully known. However,direct and indirect effects on the shrimp by siltation are significantlyreduced because a swimming hole is formed outside of the live stream andthe pool/riffle characteristics of the stream remain intact. Further, thismethod has been tried in East Austin Creek where there are three graveldams. There are 24 summer gravel dams on the lower reaches of Austin Creekand the shrimp no longer occurs in these reaches of the stream. However,shrimp could occur in isolated refugia in the upper reaches of the stream.In its present state, Austin Creek is not suitable habitat because it lacksundercut banks and overhanging vegetation which are the essential habitatrequirements for the shrimp. Extensive rehabilitation of the aquatic habitatwould be necessary to convert this stream to usable shrimp habitat. Whenthe number and size of the dams are decreased by 1990, a more natural poolto riffle ratio should occur in all streams in the Austin Creek system,which is desirable habitat for the shrimp. Overhanging vegetation can beencouraged to grow and provide shelter and food for the shrimp.The Service will work through the section 7 consultation process of theAct to assist agencies in the planning phase of water dependent projectsand measures are likely to be developed and implemented to reduce or avoidadverse effects on the shrimp and its habitat. The Service will providetechnical assistance and advice to parties interested in increasing andenhancing the shrimp habitat through appropriate mitigation measures.<T3>Comment 4:</T3> Several commenters were concerned that the shrimp willbe collected and transferred into streams outside its known distribution,thus possibly making such other areas subject to the provisions of theAct.<T3>Service response:</T3> Although shrimp could be placed in other streamsin the area, it is doubtful that a population could become establishedbecause of the specific microhabitat requirements of the shrimp. Historically,these microhabitat requirements have limited the distribution of the shrimp.During the development of the recovery plan for this species, the Servicewill explore the need to reintroduce shrimp into areas from which theyhave been extirpated. It is generally Service policy not to introduce aspecies into an area outside of its known historical range. If a populationof shrimp is discovered in areas not presently known to the Service, theseshrimp will receive the same protection under the Act as those in knownlocations.<T3>Comment 5: </T3>What are the economic impacts of listing the shrimpand what affect will the listing have on gravel operations, agriculture,urban development (construction), recreation, and other activities in thethree counties? Will the listing cause delays in projects? Commenters askedfor assurances that there would be little, if any, economic impact andwhat appropriate mitigation measures would be acceptable to permit theactivities to continue. It was suggested that the Service designate criticalhabitat and prepare an economic analysis as part of that proposal.<T3>Service response: </T3>Under the Act and its implementing regulations,listing determinations are to be made solely on the basis of the best availablescientific and commercial information regarding a species' status, withoutreference to possible economic or other impacts of such determination.16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(1)(A); 50 CFR 424.11(b).Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires agencies to evaluate theiractions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangeredor threatened and with respect to its critical habitat if any is designatedor proposed. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provisionof the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requires Federalagencies to ensure that any action they authorize, fund, or carry out isnot likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species orresult in the destruction or adverse modification of its critical habitat.If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation withthe Service.One Federal activity that may affect the California freshwater shrimp isthe authorization by the Corps of Engineers to construct summer dams. Forexample, the Cazadero Dam Committee has received a permit to construct28 temporary summer dams on the Austin Creek system, three of which areon East Austin Creek. These gravel structures are built by local residentsto impound water for swimming and fire control. This permit is valid until1990, provided that the permittee adheres to the general and special conditionsof the permit such as notification of California Department of Fish andGame and the Corps of Engineers about any changes to pemitted activities.Special permit conditions require the permittee to reduce the total numberof dams from 33 to 25 on the Austin Creek system. This includes a reductionin the number of dams from 5 to 3 on East Austin Creek where the shirmpoccurs. The permit conditions also require the permittee to reduce thesize and height of these dams, including the amount of water impounded,and to reduce the number and size of beaches by 1990 on the entire AustinCreek system. The Corps of Engineers may modify, suspend, revoke, or cancelthe permit at any time before 1990 if any of these conditions are not metby the permittee. These restrictions were devised for the benefit of anadromousfish and the freshwater shrimp. Other methods of water retention for summerrecreation and municipal water supplies that do not adversely affect theshrimp are being explored, such as joining an existing aqueduct and reservoirsystem. The Soil Conservation Service and the Coastal Conservancy are activelyassisting in conservation measures for the shrimp on Salmon and BlucherCreeks.Project delays can be avoided when proper measures such as habitat restorationor stream enhancement are taken to conserve and protect the shrimp andits habitat in the early stages of the planning process. To prevent delaysin urban development, gravel and aggregate mining, agricultural, and recreationalprojects, early consultation with the Service on issues concerning theshrimp and its habitat is advised. Section 7 consultation must be completedwithin 90 days and can be concurrent with other environmental reviews.Therefore, delays, if any, should be minimal. Through formal consultation,the Service determines whether, and in what manner, a Federal agency cancarry out its proposed action consistent with the``jeopardy'' prohibitionof section 7(a)(2) of the Act. If the Service finds that the action islikely to jeopardize the continued existence of the shrimp, the Servicewill work with the Federal agency, and applicant, if any, to attempt todevelop reasonable and prudent alternatives.Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a specieswhich is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for the California freshwater shrimp at this timefor reasons given below (see Critical Habitat section below). An economicanalysis is done only if critical habitat has been proposed. Regardless,the Secretary is required to base the decision to list a species on thebest available scientific and commercial information and not on economicconsiderations.<T3>Comment 6</T3>: One commenter asked why it took so long to proposethe shrimp and what was done to prevent the listing.<T3>Service response</T3>: The California freshwater shrimp was proposedas a threatened species on January 12, 1977, in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(42 FR 2507). That proposal was withdrawn onDecember 10, 1979 (44 FR 70796) under a provision of the 1978 amendmentsto the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which required withdrawal of allpending proposals if they were not finalized within 2 years of the proposal.On March 23, and October 30, 1980, the Service received a series of annotatedmaps delineating the known, current distribution of the shrimp based upondistributional data collected by California Department of Fish and Gamein 1979 and 1980. Eng (1981) and Serpa (1985) submitted detailed informationon the distribution, life history, and status of the shrimp. These mapsand additional data provided significant new information on which to proposeendangered status for the shrimp. In addition, work on listing other speciesprecluded the Service from preparing and processing this proposal any earlier.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>After a thorough review and consideration of all information available,the Service has determined that the California freshwater shrimp (<T3>Syncaris pacifica</T3>) should be classified as an endangered species.Procedures found at section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C.1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determinedto be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the fivefactors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their applicationto the California freshwater shrimp (<T3>Syncaris pacifica</T3>) are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range. </T3>The preferred habitat of the California freshwatershrimp is quiet, tree-lined pools with undercut banks in free-flowing,permanent streams. Livestock, agricultural activities and development,water pollution, heavy earth-moving equipment, and residential developmenthave encroached and/or threatened these stream banks. Siltation from poorsoil conservation practices and the building of temporary summer dams havedestroyed shrimp habitat. Water diversions from the streams, includingpumping directly from the stream bottom, resulting in intermittent streamflow are also detrimental to the species. Many streams currently or historicallyharboring the shrimp maintained a permanent flow. The shrimp is killedand its habitat is polluted if the water in summer dams is treated withchlorine or other chemicals to purify the water. These biocides are routinelyplaced in the water, resulting in aquatic invertebrate and plant die-offseach year. Various combinations of the above activities have extirpatedthe species from Stemple Creek, Laguna de Santa Rosa Creek, Santa RosaCreek, and Atascadero Creek, and seriously reduced its range in the NapaRiver. These extirpations probably represent more than half of the historicalrange of the shrimp. The concrete lining of streams and rivers for floodcontrol caused the extinction of <T3>Syncaris pasadenae, </T3>a species historically known from southernCalifornia. This flood control technique has extirpated the Californiafreshwater shrimp in Santa Rosa Creek. The channelization and lining islikely to continue and increase as this area experiences rapid urban growth.B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific or educationalpurposes.</T3> Not applicable.C. <T3>Disease or predation.</T3> Predation by fish significantly threatensthe California freshwater shrimp, especially in altered habitats wherecover from tree roots and underwater vegetation has been reduced or isabsent. Introduced bluegill (<T3>Lepomis macrochirus</T3>) exist in portions of Huichica Creek. Predationsignificantly threatens the California freshwater shrimp in East AustinCreek and Big Austin Creek where temporary summer dams confine steelhead(<T3>Salmo gairdneri</T3>), Sacramento squawfish (<T3>Ptychocheilus grandis</T3>), and Tule perch (<T3>Hysterocarpus traski</T3>) with the shrimp in artificial pools (BillCox, CDFG, pers. comm., 1985). The effect of these dams on shrimp and steelheadpopulations is being studied.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.</T3> The CaliforniaState Fish and Game Commission listed the California freshwater shrimpas endangered. However, State law provides no protection on privately-ownedlands. The species receives some protection in those portions of its rangewithin Samuel P. Taylor State Park.E. <T3>Other natural or man-made factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>In the past, the shrimp was capable of recovering from environmental extremes,such as drought and spring floods, that resulted in localized extirpations.Historic silvicultural practices may have limited the range of the speciesby altering normal hydrologic regime. Today, these natural events devastatepopulations of the shrimp because the current loss of suitable habitatmakes it difficult to effectively repopulate affected areas.Vandalism is a threat to the shrimp as more people in the area have becomeaware of its presence and site specific locations. Acts of vandalism suchas placing toxicants into the water or deliberate spills of refined oilcan be carried out by a single individual. One case was reported in 1987,when there was a die off of all aquatic invertebrates from East AustinCreek at the Boy Scout dam downstream almost to the confluence with BigAustin Creek as the result of the application of chlorine to the water.Although not carried out with the intention of harming the shrimp, theincident serves to illustrate the potential for vandalism.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list the California freshwater shrimp as endangered.The continued degradation and loss of suitable habitat resulting from thethreats discussed under Factor A in the ``Summary of Factors Affectingthe Species'' could result shortly in a substantial loss of the remainingpopulations, especially those colonies in East Austin Creek. Because ofconflicts with long standing economic interests and recreational practicesin these streams harboring the California freshwater shrimp, the shrimpmay shortly become extinct, as was the case with its congener, <T3>Syncaris pasadenae.</T3> Provided with protection from habitat degradationand loss, local isolated colonies may repopulate many portions of its historicalrange. Critical habitat is not being designated for the species at thistime for the reasons discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a specieswhich is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for the California freshwater shrimp at this time.As discussed under Factor E in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species,''this species and its habitats are vulnerable to the introduction of waterborne toxicants, and spills of refined oil and other such pollutants. Somesuch incidents could be carried out by a single individual, which makesthe species vulnerable to acts of vandalism. These activities are difficultto regulate and control because the habitat of the shrimp predominatelyoccurs on privately-owned land. Publication of critical habitat descriptionsand maps would make this species and its habitats more vulnerable and wouldincrease enforcement problems. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federalagency most involved with the shrimp, is aware of the known localities.All other involved parties and landowners will be notified of the locationand importance of protecting this species' habitat. Protection of thisspecies' habitat will be addressed through the recovery process and throughthe section 7 jeopardy standard. Therefore, it would not be prudent todetermine critical habitat for the California freshwater shrimp at thistime. <ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingand harm are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(2) ofthe Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize,fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existenceof a listed species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat.If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation withthe Service. The only known Federal activities that may affect the California freshwatershrimp is the authorization by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)for the construction of 28 temporary summer gravel dams on the Austin Creeksystem, and the Soil Conservation Service bank stabilization and repairprojects on Salmon and Bulcher Creeks. The summer gravel dams are builtby local residents to impound water for swimming and fire control. Thispermit is valid until 1990, provided that the permittee adheres to thegeneral and special conditions of the permit such as consultation withthe appropriate State and Federal agencies. Special permit conditions requiredthe permittee to reduce the number, size, and height of these dams, includingthe amount of water impounded, and to reduce the number and size of beachesby 1990. The Corps may modify, suspend, revoke, or cancel the permit atany time before 1990 if any of these conditions are not met by the permittee.This permit does not cover the other temporary non-gravel dams and bridges.These projects are handled on a project-by-project basis. The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth aseries of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangeredwildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subjectto the jurisdiction of the United States to take, import or export, shipin interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity,or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listedspecies. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport,or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptionswould apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available for scientificpurposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/orfor incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities. Insome instances, permits may be issued during a specified period of timeto relieve undue economic hardship that would be suffered if such reliefwere not available.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.
