(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge on Friday cleared the way for aunion representing Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. employees to sueWickes Corp. for damages stemming from a failed 1986 takeoverattempt of Owens-Corning by the retailing conglomerate.   A spokeswoman for Santa Monica, Calif-based Wickes said it wouldappeal the decision by Superior Court Judge Raymond F. Drozdowski.The judge denied Wickes' request to dismiss the case.   The Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics andamp; Allied WorkersInternational Union, based in Media, Pa., filed suit againstWickes, contending the company ``interfered with economicexpectations'' between union members and Owens-Corning.   Wickes, best known for its home improvement centers andfurniture business, abandoned a 2{-week-old takeover attempt forOwens-Corning in August 1986 after its $2.1 billion tender offerapparently was beaten out by a more lucrative restructuring planproposed by the Toledo, Ohio-based company.   In October 1986, Owens-Corning announced it would lay off 5,000workers nationwide, including 500 at its Barrington, N.J. facility,to thwart the hostile takeover.   Wickes made a $30 million profit after expenses in itsunsuccessful takeover bid.   ``The union will persist in our efforts to win just compensationfor our members harmed by the Wickes takeover attempt,'' James E.Hatfield, the union's international president, said in a statement.   Union officials could not be reached Friday for additonalcomment.   Owens-Corning is the world's largest manufacturer of glass fibermaterials and is a major producer of polyester resins andhigh-performance composite materials used in construction, autosand boats.</TEXT></DOC>
