Moreover, subsidies to electricity, natural gas, and coalare even more pervasive. As for both microeconomic and macroeconomiceffects, Kosmo shows that the putative benefits of subsidies - economicstimulation, enhanced trade performance, and inflation control - aren'tthe true effects. Indeed, subsidies tend to increase unemployment (asenergy is substituted for labor) and encourage over-investment in energy-intensiveindustries at the expense of other sectors. At the same time, they havelittle impact on overall trade balances, inflation, or the lot of thepoor. Energy subsidies also translate into foregone revenues and theinefficient use of energy. Of course, the ill effects of energy subsidiescannot be rooted out overnight without traumatizing a nation's economy,even if politics permitted. But Money to Burn? does point the way toa politically and economically acceptable transition to the next energyera, one based on sharp increases in energy efficiency in rich and poorcountries alike. Chapters are devoted to the following: Energy PricingPolicy: Hwat is at Stake; Current Fuel-Pricing Trends; MacroeconomicEffects of Energy Subsidies; and Microeconomic Effects of Energy Subsidies.83 references, 11 figure, 14 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
