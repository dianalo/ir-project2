The White House described the movement as ``an emergencydeployment readiness exercise'' triggered by what it called theinvasion of Honduras by 1,500 to 2,000 Nicaraguan forces pursuingContra rebels.   The exercise involves two battalions of the 82nd AirborneDivision from Fort Bragg, N.C., and two battalions from the 7thInfantry Division at Fort Ord, Calif.   The troops will be posted out of harm's way for an indefiniteperiod near the Palmerola Air Force Base in Honduras, about 125miles from the area of reported hostilities, said Marlin Fitzwater,the president's spokesman.   ``This exercise is a measured response designed to show ourstaunch support to the democratic government of Honduras at a timewhen its territorial integrity is being violated by the Cuban- andSoviet-supported Sandinista army,'' Fitzwater said in a late-nightannouncement.   He said it also was ``a signal to the governments and peoples ofCentral America of the seriousness with which the United Statesgovernment views the current situation in the region.''   Some congressional Democrats weren't buying the administration'srationale.   ``It's an overreaction,'' said Senate Majority Leader RobertByrd, D-W.Va. ``The Sandinistas have crossed over the border beforeand gone back.''   ``I just hope it's merited,'' Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said,recalling a similar incident two years ago when the United Statesjumped to the aid of Honduras under circumstances many saw asexaggerated by the White House. Then, as now, the development cameas the administration was pushing a reluctant Congress to approvemilitary aid to the Contras.   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., said, ``This is not the firsttime the president has made use of his military authority after helost a vote on the Contras. President Reagan's decision to send the82nd Airborne to Honduras has more to do with politics than withAmerican security. It is an irresponsible involvement of Americantroops in the conflict in Central America and an unwise escalationof tensions in that region.''   However, a number of Republicans were supportive.   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., said the deploymentwas intended ``psychologically to give an indication that we arenot just going to stand by and have Nicaragua ... make incursionsinto neighboring countries.''   Rep. Jack Fields, R-Texas, said, ``I don't think the presidentreally had an alternative.''   Congressional leaders were briefed by telephone late Wednesday.   Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state for inter-Americanaffairs, said Congress would receive information today documentingthe Nicaraguan incursion.   ``We will present evidence ... which proves conclusively thatthere was a very large Sandinista incursion into Honduras, thatwill show, I think, what to make of President Ortega's claim thatthere isn't one single Nicaraguan soldier in Honduras. It's alie,'' Abrams said on ABC's ``Nightline.''   Fitzwater said upwards of 2,000 Sandinistas are in Honduras.``They are there and we have seen no evidence that they areretreating to their own country.''   The developments came as Secretary of State George P. Shultz andWhite House officials conferred with congressional leaders aboutthe possibility of a new aid package for the Contra rebels tryingto topple Nicaragua's leftist regime.   U.S. aid to the rebels ran out two weeks ago, and theadministration is hoping the new situation will earn the Contrasgreater sympathy in Congress.   Nicaraguan Defense Ministry officials denied Wednesday there wasany border crossing but later President Daniel Ortega appeared toleave open that possibility.   In a radio address, he said Sandinista forces had pushed backthe Contras into Honduras and that there was ``cross-fire fromHonduran territory against our forces.'' His remarks did notconfirm or deny the administration claims.   Fitzwater said the U.S. deployment came in response to a requestfrom Honduran President Jose Azcona. He said Reagan was briefed onthe request about 8 p.m. EST in his residence and decided to sendin U.S. forces.   ``As the president said when he was briefed on this issue, `Whenfriends ask for our support, we should provide it,''' Fitzwatersaid.   Some 12,500 American military personnel are stationed in CentralAmerica, including roughly 10,000 who are located in Panama. TotalU.S. military manpower in Honduras varies from week to week,depending upon the exercises being conducted.</TEXT></DOC>
