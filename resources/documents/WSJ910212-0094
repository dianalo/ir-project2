So far in the Persian Gulf war, U.S. weapons technologyhas looked terrific, scoring devastating precision hits fromthe air and sea with minimum loss of U.S. lives. But theDragon II anti-tank missile hasn't been heard from yet, andwhen it has, many experts think, the cheering could stop.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Our anti-tank weapon is a disgrace,&quot; says retired ArmyCol. Harry Summers, a land-warfare expert. &quot;It just doesn'twork.&quot; Ray Dunham, a weapons analyst for Congress's GeneralAccounting Office, says, &quot;Our studies have shown it to beineffective in killing tanks.&quot;   There are three main problems with the Dragon, critics andArmy officials agree: It can be tough to aim, it requires thesoldier firing it to expose himself to enemy fire, and itprobably can't penetrate up-to-date tank armor. Even Armyspokesmen don't hide their view that the Dragon, made byMcDonnell Douglas Corp., isn't very good.   &quot;It's certainly not what I would want my kid to take intocombat,&quot; says Dave Harris, public-affairs officer for theArmy Missile Command in Alabama. &quot;But it is all we have, andwe believe it will do the job against the armor we'll see inthe Gulf.&quot;   The Dragon was developed in the 1960s and fielded in 1970.The reason Army officials believe it can still be useful isbecause most of Iraq's tanks are older Soviet models thatlack the best armor. In any event, the Army says,Dragon-equipped foot soldiers will get help in destroyingtanks from heavier anti-tank weapons designed to be fired byfellow soldiers in armored vehicles, helicopters, planes orU.S. tanks.   McDonnell Douglas officials would rather talk about theirhighly praised war products, such as the Tomahawk cruisemissile. Jim Schlueter, a spokesman for McDonnell DouglasMissile Systems Co. in St. Louis, says, &quot;McDonnell Douglasbelieves the key issue with the Dragon II is training, andthat in the hands of a well-trained operator, the Dragon IIcan be a very effective anti-tank weapon.&quot; Mr. Schlueter saysthat inadequate training has accounted for many Dragonproblems in years past and that troops in the Mideast arebetter prepared.   The Dragon II consists of a small missile in a launchertube designed to be carried and fired by a single soldier.With its associated gear, it weighs about 50 pounds, and isfired from the shoulder with the aid of a support stand.   Unlike the Patriot or the &quot;smart&quot; bombs being used in thewar, the Dragon isn't a &quot;fire-and-forget&quot; weapon. The soldiermust manually guide the Dragon to its target, using anoptical sight to keep cross-hairs on the opposing tank forthe 10 seconds or more the missile takes to reach it. Often,the missile's recoil is so great that the soldier's aim isthrown off.   To use the Dragon, the soldier must get within 0.6 mile ofthe enemy tank -- dangerously close in tank-warfare terms.During the missile's flight, he remains connected to thespeeding weapon by a thin wire that rapidly unreels behind it-- and, since he can only fire the Dragon from a sittingposition or while standing in a foxhole, his upper torso isexposed above ground level. Adding to his vulnerability, theDragon gives off a &quot;signature&quot; when fired -- smoke, a flash,noise.   &quot;It lets everybody know where you are, and then everybodycan shoot at you,&quot; says Robert Sherman, a weapons expert onthe staff of Rep. Les AuCoin (D., Ore.). A 1983 governmentstudy estimated that between one-fifth and one-third ofsoldiers firing Dragons could be expected to be hit by&quot;direct fire.&quot;   Finally, the Army and its critics agree that the Dragon IIprobably can't penetrate the best layered armor in the Sovietarsenal or the new &quot;reactive&quot; armor that explodes when hit todeflect an incoming missile.   For soldiers in the war, the only silver lining is thatIraq doesn't have the world's best tanks and that the Dragonisn't the only thing the U.S. has to stop them. Baghdad'shuge tank fleet is mainly made up of Soviet T-54, T-55 andT-62 models, which lack modern armor. &quot;The Dragon is probablyadequate against the T-54s, T-55s and the 62s,&quot; says Mr.Sherman.   One question mark is the Soviet-made T-72, a later modelthat Iraq also possesses. U.S. intelligence agencies don'tbelieve Moscow sold Saddam Hussein the most potent version ofthe T-72, which is equipped with layered or explosive armor.But even a plain-vanilla T-72 may not be disabled by a Dragonfrom the front, concedes the Army's Mr. Harris. So, he says,&quot;the army is training soldiers to attack from the rear andthe sides.&quot;   Another positive factor in the war, the Army says, is thatthe Dragon is a weapon of last resort. Many Iraqi tanks, it'shoped, will be wiped out by air attacks and by troopstraveling in U.S. tanks and other armored vehicles and usingother weapons.   The most important of these is the TOW missile. Like theDragon, it requires manual optical guidance through a thinwire. But it has triple the range of the Dragon, is far morepowerful and can be fired by troops from inside or outsidearmored vehicles. In the first big ground skirmish of thewar, at the Saudi town of Khafji, TOW missiles reportedly didwell against Iraqi tanks.   Other potent anti-tank weapons in U.S. hands are theHellfire missile, fired from Apache helicopters; the Maverickmissile, fired from fighter planes; and special penetratingshells fired from artillery pieces and from the M-1 tank,which is itself believed very resistant to Iraqi anti-tankweapons.   Still, the need for a better infantry anti-tank weapon hasbeen evident since the Vietnam War, when U.S. troops oftenpreferred captured Soviet weapons to the U.S. models withwhich they were supplied. The Army and the Congress have beentalking about replacing the Dragon for years, but the efforthas been marred by false starts in which promisedwonder-weapons didn't work out.   The current candidate is a research project called AAWS-M(pronounced &quot;awesome&quot;), for Advanced Anti-armor WeaponSystem-Medium. It will supposedly have automated guidance anda long range, but it may be too costly to give to manyinfantryman, and it won't be ready until 1994 or later.   In recent years, some members of Congress have wanted theArmy to buy foreign-made missiles as a stopgap solution. Butthe Army and congressional opponents argued that the Frenchand Swedish missiles that were the likeliest candidates hadproblems of their own and that a foreign purchase would sapmomentum from the AAWS-M program.   Meanwhile, the Marine Corps, despairing of an effectiveone-man tank killer, has been training its troops to killtanks at close range using homemade explosives of gasoline,styrofoam and soap powder.</TEXT></DOC>
