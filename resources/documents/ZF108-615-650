Ory,who heads CDC's IRM office.andP;  &quot;My job is coordination.candM;It took management support, as well as cooperation from the scientific staff,to make decentralization work.andP;  &quot;The scientific side of CDC is prettycomputer-oriented,&quot; Ory said.andP;  &quot;Most scientists here have been programmingsince the mid-1970s.&quot;andM;About 2,000 of CDC's micros are on IBM Corp. Token-Ring local area networksunder Novell Inc. NetWare, with 10 to 160 stations per LAN.andP;  In turn, 40 ofthese LANs are connected to a wide area network with bridges and routers fromVitalink Communications Corp. of Fremont, Calif.andM;CDC has sites in Atlanta; Raleigh, N.C.; Hyattsville, Md.; Washington;Morgantown, W.Va.; Cincinnati; and small outposts in Alaska, Colorado andPuerto Rico.andM;&quot;In another 18 months, we'll have the whole kit and caboodle networked andthen connected to the wide area network,&quot; Ory said.andM;Most of the scientific computing takes place on an IBM 3090 Model 200Emainframe.andP;  About 90 percent of CDC's 5,000 employees have PCs on their desksand can access the mainframe with IBM 3270 emulation cards.andM;&quot;We didn't buy a PC for each person,&quot; Ory said.andP;  &quot;They bought them as fundsbecame available and they identified a need.andP;  All we did was set the goal ofhaving a PC on everyone's desk.&quot;andM;Ory and his staff want to wean the agency away from a 10-year-old WangLaboratories Inc. network for word processing and electronic mail, and moveinto a distributed environment built on PC LANs and the WAN.andM;&quot;For five years we have been trying to integrate our entire computingenvironment -- administrative, scientific and communications,c Ory said.andM;CDC software is developed with the Adabas relational database managementsystem and Natural fourth-generation language from software AG of Reston, Va.andM;On the administrative side, CDC has an on-line integrated environment thatOry described as &quot;not quite paperless, but as close as you can get.andP;  If yousign onto the travel system, as soon as you type in your name it knows yourSocial Security number, your accounting information, the chain of approvalyour request has to go through, what information to pass on to the accountingsystem and so forth.&quot;andM;On the scientific side, Ory's staff is identifying data sets that arerelevant to public health and cataloging them at the data element level.andP;  Thedata sets will go into a comprehensive database called Wide-Ranging On-LineData for Epidemiological Research (Wonder), also written with Adabas/Natural.andM;Wonder will be &quot;a way for public health professionals to get access to dataeven though they are not computer-literate -- it's all in English,c Ory said.andM;Wonder's half-dozen major databases come from the National Institute ofAlcohol Abuse and Addiction, the National Center for Health Services Researchand the Census Bureau.andP;  &quot;Depending on how we define it, Wonder ultimatelycould have hundreds of thousands of data sets we want people to have accessto,&quot; Ory said.andM;Running a laissez-faire IRM organization is not without its headaches.andP;  Forexample maverich groups have been known to defy Ory's IBM-compatible MS-DOSPC standard.andM;&quot;There are some things that we hold the line on,&quot; Ory said.andP;  &quot;We have Ms-DOSmachines as opposed to Macintosh and UNIX machines.andP;  It was tough, but weonly had to give in on a very few cases.andP;  All in all, I would guess therearen't more than two dozen Macintoshes at CDC.andM;&quot;We fought UNIX because the things it does well generally are not the thingswe need to do, and it is too hard to maintain the expertise for oneapplication.andP;  It's just not cost-effective.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
