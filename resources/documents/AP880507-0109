Marcel Fontaine, 45, was released Wednesday by his pro-Iraniancaptors in Beirut along with fellow diplomat Marcel Carton, 64, andjournalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 44.   Carton and Kauffmann were recuperating with their families.   Carton's daughter, Simone El-Khoury, said her father was happybut exhausted and had given up hope of freedom when he was finallyfreed.   ``He didn't believe in it anymore. He was completely depressed,crying all the time. He was chained, locked up, without sun, alwaysblindfolded,'' Mrs. El-Khoury told The Associated Press in atelephone interview from her home in Collonge-Bellerive, a Genevasuburb.   Carton got the first glimpse of his 3-year-old granddaughterJoumana, born to Mrs. El-Khoury shortly before he was kidnapped onMarch 22, 1985, with Fontaine.   Kauffmann, a reporter for the weekly magazine L'Evenement duJeudi, left for a few days vacation at an undisclosed location inthe French countryside, according to his employer. He was kidnappedMay 22, 1985.   Fontaine's wife, Elaine, said her husband began to get verynervous Friday night. He went to see a doctor Saturday who ordereda ``period of decompression'' in the Val de Grace military hospital.   Fontaine, Carton and Kauffmann returned to France on Thursdayand spent two days at Val de Grace undergoing extensive medicaltests.   Fontaine, interviewed Friday night by the French radio stationEurope 1, said his worst moments during captivity came when hiskidnappers staged mock executions, holding a pistol to his neck,then firing another weapon to frighten him.   He said they accused him of being a spy for the CIA and Israel.   ``The tribunal has convicted you,'' he said he was told on oneoccasion. ``You will be executed this evening.''   ``They put a hood on me and faced me to the wall. One of themput a pistol to my neck and another fired a gun behind me,'' hesaid.   Fontaine said he was blindfolded by day and chained during muchof his time in captivity. Conditions improved in the last sixmonths when he was kept in an apartment, his bed was made, thefloor vacuumed and he was allowed to watch some television.   A spokesman for the American Embassy in Paris said U.S.officials had spoken with Fontaine for three hours about the nineAmericans still being held by Shiite Moslem kidnappers in Lebanon,including Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press.   Anderson, kidnapped March 16, 1985, is the longest-held of the18 foreign hostages.   The embassy refused to disclose details of the talks, which wereconducted in the presence of French officials. The spokesman saidthe U.S. officials hoped to interview Carton and Kauffmann in thenext few days.</TEXT></DOC>
