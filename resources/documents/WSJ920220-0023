That's what investors did this week as yields continued toshrivel in money-market mutual funds.</LP><TEXT>   Investors pulled $13.1 billion from money-market funds,sending assets of the 527 taxable funds tracked byIBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report down to $496.6 billion.   Where did they go? Short-term Treasurys, Eurodollars andcommercial paper, says Martha Wittbrodt, editor of theAshland, Mass., newsletter. &quot;Rates on all of those were upslightly last week, giving them an advantage overmoney-market funds,&quot; she says.   Most of the outflow was from fleeing institutionalinvestors. In recent weeks, institutions poured billions intomoney funds despite falling yields, because yields wereslightly higher than alternative cash investments.   Now, however, yields on money-market funds no longer havean edge. The average seven-day compound taxable yield droppedto 3.86% from 3.92%, in the week ended Tuesday, Donoghue'ssaid. The average 30-day compound yield slid to 3.98% from4.05%. Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends.   Meanwhile, the average seven-day simple yield of thetaxable money funds fell to 3.78% from 3.85%, and the average30-day simple yield eased to 3.90% from 3.97%.   Investors can find funds with higher-than-average yields.For example, seven-day compound taxable yields were 4.58% atFidelity Spartan Money Market fund; 4.52% on Evergreen MoneyMarket Trust; and 4.50% on Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar MoneyMarket, according to Donoghue's.   Tax-free money-market funds also suffered declines inassets and yields. Assets of 293 tax-free funds fell by$117.9 million to $98.8 billion.   The average seven-day compound yield of tax-free fundsfell to 2.73% from 2.81%. The latest yield is equivalent to3.79% on a taxable investment for someone in the 28% taxbracket and to 4.07% for those paying 31% in taxes.   The average maturity of the investments increased one dayto 58 days in taxable funds. The average maturity of thetax-exempt funds' investments also increased by one day, to51 days.   Investors may be disappointed with the yields, but theywon't do much better in most money-market accounts at banks.   The average yield on money-market accounts at banks andthrifts was 3.75% in a survey conducted Tuesday by Bank RateMonitor, a North Palm Beach, Fla., newsletter.   Money-market funds are able to offer slightly higher ratesthan banks because they are a managed portfolio of short-termsecurities, such as Treasury bills, shortterm bankcertificates of deposit and commercial paper (short-termcorporate IOUs). When yields on short-term securities aredeclining, the older, higher-yielding securities in thefunds' portfolios delay the impact on the funds' overallyields.   In contrast, rates offered by banks on money-marketaccounts are set by the banks based on their need for themoney to make loans, the cost of alternative sources of fundsand competitive factors.   Banks that aren't trying to attract assets offer trulymeasly yields. Money-market accounts are yielding 3.05% atChemical Bank in New York and 3.04% at Texas Commerce Bank inHouston.   In contrast, First Deposit National Bank in Tilton, N.H.,is paying 4.93%, and AFBA Industrial Bank in ColoradoSprings, Colo., is paying 4.75%.   Lest investors complain too much, they might want to takea look at rates on interest-bearing checking accounts. Thefive largest banks in New York are currently paying a rate ofjust 2%, according to Bank Rate Monitor.</TEXT></DOC>
