And when market researcher Selina S. Guber corners them on their home turf, near the Woodbridge Square Mall in New Jersey, they talk brand preferences and spending habits with the enthusiasm of any suburban housewife.    They debate the merits of microwaves vs. conventional ovens, trade tips on preparing tortillas and pasta, and sneer at TV dinners. When asked about big items they have recently helped persuade their families to buy, theirs is a litany of luxuries: a VCR, a TV set, a computer, a boat. Even a house by the New Jersey shore.    When it comes to purchases, these youngsters are adroit at manipulating their parents. &quot;You beg,&quot; explains Christy, a pert 14-year-old. &quot;Every five minutes you ask again.&quot; Why do her parents knuckle under? &quot;They're soft -- they want you to stop yelling. They say take the money and go.&quot;    The youngsters' observations reflect a seismic shift in purchasing power in the American home. Mom and Dad, too busy making money to spend it, are surrendering the purse strings to their children. The children, in turn, seem born to shop -- and not just for toys and candy.    With 65% of all mothers now working, children are learning self-reliance at a tender age. Youngsters not yet in their teens are shopping and cooking for the family, scheduling their own orthodontist appointments and piano lessons, tending pets and buying their own clothes. Sociologists scrutinizing the changing American household use the term &quot;self-nurturing&quot; to describe children's after-school independence.    Acquisitive, brand-conscious and lavished with the kind of money that two-career households can provide, youngsters have only recently begun to merit serious consideration from a broad spectrum of U.S. marketers. Yet a stroll through any department store makes it plain that &quot;yuppie puppies&quot; have visions of dollar-signs dancing in their heads.    At Babyland on New York's Fifth Avenue, Corporate Kids (Cabbage Patch dolls in pin stripes), vie for space next to the Parker Brothers' board game, Go for It (&quot;You can have it all! New cars, expensive homes, exotic vacations&quot;). A few blocks away, Bloomingdale's displays adult-sized agenda books that sell briskly to 12-year-olds and Pressman Toy Corp.'s Bank on It, a game that makes &quot;learning about money fun.&quot;    Marketers' new interest in children reaches far beyond toy counters, however. Sony Corp. last year introduced its My First Sony line of audio products for children four and up. Fisher-Price Toys, a division of Quaker Oats Co., rolled out a $225 kids' camcorder this Christmas, a pricey departure from its mainstay line of preschool toys. Procter andamp; Gamble Co. recently launched Crest for Kids toothpaste with a $25,000 name-the-flavor contest. Hallmark Cards Inc. is venturing into children's cards, accessories and school supplies, while Scott Paper Co. brings out Kachoos, a children's facial tissue.    Longstanding skittishness about marketing directly to kids is fading with the appearance of demographic data on children's consumer clout. Children nine to 12 spend nearly all of the $4.73 billion they get annually in allowances, gifts and earnings, according to a 1984 study by James U. McNeal, a professor at Texas Aandamp;M University. What's more, Mr. McNeal says, &quot;they are directly influencing parental spending of over $40 billion a year.&quot;    Teenage Research Unlimited in Lake Forest, Ill., calculates that kids 12 to 19 will lay out $78 billion for personal and household purchases this year, up from $65 billion in 1985. And this doesn't count their purchase influence or money spent on them by their parents. Peter Zollo, the firm's executive vice president, adds that the increases come at a time when the teen population is declining. (That decline is expected to bottom out in 1992, when the &quot;echo of the baby boom,&quot; -- the recent spurt in the birthrate -- kicks in.)    More telling still, some suggest, is the new deference being given to children's opinions in the family. &quot;Kids have been empowered to make decisions that historically they would not have made,&quot; says Susan Rebell, managing partner of Decision Research Corp.'s New York office. This fundamental power shift is only now dawning on marketers: &quot;They've been holding onto the belief that parents have control,&quot; says Ms. Guber, the president of Children's Market Research, Inc. in New York. &quot;Nobody likes to think the family is child-run rather than child-centered.&quot;    Parents are ceding power on many fronts, from TV viewing and restaurant selection to clothes shopping and vacation planning. Betsy Richardson, marketing director of Reebok International Ltd., says that when she and her family moved last year, her 13-year-old son was vocal about the family's buying a home near his school. &quot;As two working parents, we depend on his ability to get around on his own,&quot; she says. &quot;So he had a lot of impact on that decision.&quot;    Nowhere is the change more apparent than at that cornerstone of family life: the dinner table. With microwaves and frozen dinners, &quot;family meals&quot; are often haphazard and eaten at staggered times. &quot;Kids not only choose what's for dinner, but they often have to cook it themselves,&quot; Ms. Rebell of Decision Research says. &quot;There are little girls out there who live on Lean Cuisine.&quot;    A recent Yankelovich survey conducted with the Nickelodeon children's cable network and USA Today found that 23% of kids six to 15 cook their own dinners some of the time, and 6% most of the time. And, according to Teenage Research, half of all teen girls shop weekly for family groceries. Karrie Hughes, a Richmond, Va., fifth-grader, buys groceries for her mother once or twice a week. &quot;She doesn't usually tell me which brand to buy,&quot; she says. &quot;So I pick what I like.&quot; Indeed, 53% of the children in the Yankelovich study reported choosing different grocery brands than their parents.    &quot;With all the debate about whether the modern husband helps his working wife with housework, nobody thought to look at what kids were doing,&quot; says Horst Stipp, director of social research for National Broadcasting Co.    Until recently, that is. The General Foods subsidiary of Philip Morris Cos., for one, is revising its view of mother as all-powerful gatekeeper of the kitchen. Irene Rosenfeld, marketing manager for its Kool-Aid products, says that because &quot;kids have more and more influence over food purchases, we felt we had to market increasingly toward children.&quot; The portion of Kool-Aid advertising aimed at children rose 200% in the past year. Its new TV campaign features zany, kid-pleasing humor.    Similarly, Dart andamp; Kraft Inc. tailors more Kraft food advertising to girls 12 to 19, placing ads for convenience dinners in such magazines as Seventeen. And Kellogg Co. brings out Pro Grain, its first cereal aimed expressly at teens.    For the most part, kids seem proud of their growing responsibilities. Ten-year-old Bianca Pendziakow of Ramsey, N.J., says she has heated up frozen microwave dinners &quot;hundreds of times.&quot; When she arrives home from school, she says, &quot;I cook a snack and if I want to, I cook dinner.&quot; With a grin, the ponytailed youngster adds: &quot;Then when my Mom and Dad come home they have to eat it.&quot;    The media-blitzed child of the '80s is proving highly brand-conscious. A New York TV executive relates that her pre-teen daughter recently asked her: &quot;What designer clothes did you wear when you were a kid, Mom?&quot; The interest in labels starts early. &quot;Even two-year-olds are concerned about their brand of clothes, and by the age of six they are full-out consumers,&quot; says Dale Wallenius, publisher of the Marketing to Kids Report, a new monthly newsletter.    When his parents were about to buy a home computer last year, Aryeh Simmonds, a Teaneck, N.J., 13-year-old, was the one who decided on an Apple IIc. &quot;I researched it in Consumer Reports and computer magazines,&quot; he says, adding matter-of-factly: &quot;I know more about computers than my parents do.&quot;    Thus, even companies that don't sell to children have come to recognize the need, as Texas Aandamp;M's Mr. McNeal puts it, &quot;to start growing their customers early.&quot; Black andamp; Decker Corp. has licensed its name to a line of toys that are miniature versions of its small appliances. &quot;Youngsters don't buy Black andamp; Decker drills,&quot; says Mr. Wallenius. &quot;But they might someday, if they start out on toy Dustbusters.&quot;    A similar strategy inspired New York's First Women's Bank to found a bank for children. Awaiting regulatory approval to open in the F.A.O. Schwarz toy store in Manhattan this spring, the First Children's Bank will require a $250 minimum deposit. Offering checking and savings accounts, it also will allow youngsters to purchase the store's toys using a &quot;debit card.&quot; Says Neale S. Godfrey, president of the First Women's Bank: &quot;What better way to build loyalty to a bank than to get them when they are young?&quot;    If, as Ms. Godfrey suggests, children suffer from a lack of education about money, they aren't likely to languish in ignorance much longer. Not only have other children's banks opened, but now young capitalists-in-training can avail themselves of a money-management summer camp. Held at The Breakers, a Palm Beach hotel, the camp for kids 10 to 15 is sponsored by the investment firm Gruntal andamp; Co.    Those who plunge into the children's market often do so with trepidation. Advertisers are touchy about being perceived as exploitative. (Texas Aandamp;M's Mr. McNeal says he received &quot;hate mail&quot; when he began writing about a children's &quot;market&quot; back in the '60s.) The issue is sensitive in Washington as well: A federal appeals court panel last year ordered the Federal Communications Commission to reconsider its 1984 decision eliminating guidelines on the number of commercials aired on kids' TV programs.    Actually, kids display considerable skepticism about TV and commercials. Sandra Favelukes, a sixth-grader at Bank Street School in New York, says she &quot;definitely dislikes&quot; sex stereotyping on toy commercials. &quot;Just girls play with Barbie dolls and just boys play with GI Joe,&quot; she complains. Another pet peeve: &quot;When they show kids in a car with their parents, it's too perfect. Usually kids fight in a car on a long trip. On TV, even when they fight you can tell it's fake.&quot; One of her classmates chimes in her scorn for violence-laden cartoons that close with a lofty moral. &quot;After all the shooting,&quot; she says, voice dripping with sarcasm, &quot;they'll say, 'Today we learned the importance of being loyal to your friends.'&quot;    Children, moreover, are notoriously fickle consumers -- though less so for food, experts say, than for fashion. &quot;It's always a problem and always will be,&quot; says Ms. Richardson of Reebok, which stays on top of trends with the help of student panels at high schools around the country. Further, children's advertising must strike just the right tone -- with a wide range of ages. A gritty Reebok commercial showing street kids playing basketball delighted teens, for example, but frightened younger children.    Advertisers must toe a fine line, devising commercials or products that enchant kids without turning off parents -- or, indeed, store buyers. Gregorys, a $15 cologne for boys under 10, has found its way into more than 100 boutiques, but has less luck with big retail chains. &quot;There's still resistance to selling cologne to children,&quot; says Randy Perini, president of Gregorys International in Miami. </TEXT></DOC>
