But movies like &quot;The Class of Nuke 'Em High,&quot; &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; and &quot;Surf Nazis Must Die&quot; don't win prizes.    That's all right with movie moguls Kaufman and Herz. Their small-time studio, Troma Inc., doesn't exist to please members of the Motion Picture Academy. It exists to make money, and it does, with production methods that owe more to home movies than to MGM.    While other independent studios like DeLaurentiis, Cannon, Vestron and Weintraub started out small, they succumbed to grandiosity and are struggling to survive or have already sunk. Troma, however, is entering its 15th year, cranking out movie after low-budget movie in a grubby building in Hell's Kitchen, west of Time's Square.    &quot;We're the smallest, cheapest movie studio in America,&quot; says Mr. Kaufman, sitting behind an oak desk piled high with scripts in his unkempt office. &quot;But we do everything Paramount does&quot; -- make movies, promote them, distribute them, sell foreign, videocassette and television rights.    Mr. Kaufman recently returned from the Cannes Film Festival screening of &quot;Toxic Avenger: Part II&quot; and &quot;Rabid Grannies.&quot; &quot;Toxic Avenger: Part III&quot; is now being edited; the script is being written for &quot;Class of Nuke 'Em High: Part II&quot;; and actors are trying out for &quot;Kabuki Man,&quot; the story of a New York City detective who is transformed into a flying superhero in Oriental garb.    Over at Troma's temporary production offices for &quot;Kabuki Man,&quot; boot camp for young film makers is in session. The movie's production manager is Andrew Wolk, a cherubic-faced 25-year-old who traded stocks on Wall Street for a year before arriving at Troma, having heard the company took beginners. &quot;The only thing I knew about movies was how to watch them,&quot; he says.    For &quot;Toxic Avenger: II,&quot; his first movie, he rounded up cars for chase scenes, hired most of the extras and wrote some of the script. He also shaved his head to play the part of a bad guy, who machine guns an old lady in a wheelchair.    Pericles Lewnes, age 28, is in charge of special effects. This is Mr. Lewnes's fourth Troma film. In a movie called &quot;War,&quot; he appeared in 39 different scenes and died on screen three times. In &quot;Toxic Avenger: III,&quot; he was the devil's stunt double, which required him to spit maggots. He is now quite pleased with a special effect he designed for &quot;Kabuki Man.&quot; &quot;The hero throws these Japanese noodles in a guy's face,&quot; he explains. &quot;They work their way into his mouth, nose and ears, then his stomach inflates and explodes. I did it for $10]&quot;    When it comes to making salable movies cheap, there are few more seasoned instructors than Messrs. Kaufman and Herz. Hollywood movies cost about $20 million -- excluding advertising -- and the majority don't earn what they cost. Troma claims to spend $1 million to $2 million and make money most of the time.    Troma movies are non-union, and except for a few key specialists like the cameraman, they're made by a small army of virtually unpaid, inexperienced wannabes. The star of &quot;Toxic Avenger: II&quot; was muscular Ron Fazio, an ex-football player turned nightclub bouncer who was hired without so much as a grade-school acting credit. &quot;I was the size they wanted,&quot; he says humbly.    Production values are notoriously low. Rick Collins, a Long Island lawyer with acting aspirations, says his costume as the devil in &quot;Toxic III&quot; was painted green because Troma didn't have red paint and wouldn't buy any. &quot;Pre-production&quot; on &quot;Toxic II&quot; last summer included a daily dawn cruise by the props department of curbside garbage in Manhattan. &quot;{The producers} try to get free props, food, costumes, as much as possible, for the promise of a screen credit,&quot; says Mark Torgl, who has acted in several Troma movies. &quot;At the end of a Troma movie,&quot; he says, &quot;the 'special thanks' credits roll for five minutes.&quot;    Since its actors are raw and film is expensive, Troma scripts are rehearsed repeatedly off-camera, but scenes rarely get more than one take. If an actor isn't around, he is likely to be written out of the scene. Should a sunny day turn rainy, filming continues. Mr. Collins, the lawyer, remembers a scene in &quot;War&quot; where &quot;it's raining on one person but not the other.&quot; He adds, &quot;you can't say the 'C' word around Troma. That's continuity.&quot;    The Troma boys say they lack the talent and money to make good movies so they try to make bad movies funny. In &quot;Toxic II,&quot; the hero windsurfs to Japan and battles villains in a big Tokyo fish market: One man, transfixed by the fight, doesn't notice that a bad guy has landed belly-up on his carving table and that he's hacking the man's limbs instead of a shark carcass. If you're not laughing, you're probably over 18, the prime age of Troma fans.    Troma movies are shot in three to six weeks, and sometimes they don't last much longer in theaters. But a commercial release, however brief, makes them more attractive to video stores, cable movie networks and foreign buyers. The cable channel USA Network, for example, has a new late-night weekend movie program called &quot;Up All Night&quot; for which Troma movies are steady fodder. Some Troma movies are bigger hits overseas than here. It was Japanese and German distributors who urged Troma to make a sequel of &quot;Toxic Avenger.&quot;    Tromatically speaking, &quot;Toxic Avenger&quot; is &quot;our 'Gone With the Wind,'&quot; says Mr. Kaufman, who claims it cost less than $1 million to make and has grossed more than $15 million. The hero -- who develops a chemical reaction to evil after falling into a vat of toxic waste -- has a modest cult following. Avon Books has bought paperback fiction rights, merchandisers are negotiating to make Toxic dolls and a Saturday morning cartoon is in the works.    Messrs. Kaufman and Herz started Troma in 1974. The two met at Yale, where Mr. Kaufman made student films. After college, Mr. Kaufman hooked up with director John Avildson and learned the low-budget ropes on such movies as &quot;Rocky,&quot; where his tasks included playing a drunk carried into a bar by Sylvester Stallone. Mr. Kaufman also made a string of hard-core porn movies, under a pseudonym, including a musical featuring porn star Harry Reems. Mr. Herz went to law school before joining up with his old school chum and taking on the business side of the operation.    Their earliest successes were goofy adolescent sex fantasies like &quot;Squeeze Play&quot; in which a gang of well-endowed young women form a softball team and challenge their boyfriends to a game. But when Hollywood moved into their territory, with quality teen-sex comedies like &quot;Risky Business,&quot; Troma turned to horror. &quot;Horror fans go even when the horror doesn't work,&quot; says Mr. Kaufman.    Now that Troma is doing so well that the Toxic Avenger is mutating into its own industry, some people are urging the principals to upgrade their product. &quot;I've watched Troma go from raunch to sleaze and I'm a little disappointed they don't try to broaden their audience,&quot; says Mr. Avildson, the director.    But Troma won't try. &quot;Our destiny is a small one,&quot; says Mr. Kaufman. &quot;But at least we're in control of it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
