When onetakes into account the possibility that the high-frequency limit of thephonon spectrum may be shifted considerable by the introduction intothe glass of chemical elements which differ substantially from the constituentsby their mass or cause a marked change in the effective strength antiF of the chemical bonds of the structural framework, it is desirableto try to solve the problem formulated here in the system of silicateglasses, which possess the requisite physicochemical characteristics.As additives, which cause a high-frequency shift of the phonon spectrum,the authors chose boron oxides, which have a lower atomic mass and astronger bond to oxygen than does silicon.</TEXT></DOC>
