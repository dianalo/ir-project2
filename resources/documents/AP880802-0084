(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   South Carolina's largest cash crop _aromatic, golden tobacco leaf _ went to market today as thestaccato chant of auctioneers sounded on warehouse floors.   This year's crop was expected to bring $160 million in revenues.   ``Overall it's one of the best crops we've had in a long time,''said Agriculture Commissioner Les Tindal as he surveyed piles oftobacco at the growers Big 4 Warehouse.   Warehouses here as well as in Mullins, Lake City andDarlington-Timmonsville had opening-day auctions today. Auctionswill be held for the first time this year in Loris, Conway andKingstree on Wednesday.   Observers predicted higher prices in South Carolina than lastyear's opening day average of $138.58 per hundredweight. For the1987 season, $151.6 million worth of tobacco was sold.   Early prices at the Star-New Hope Warehouse outside Lake Cityranged from $124 to $148 per hundredweight. At Planter's Warehousein Lake City, some tobacco brought as much as $164.   Gov. Carroll Campbell stopped by Planter's Warehouse, walkingalong the rows of tobacco as the auctioneers and buyers followedpurchasing leaf.   Later, Campbell criticized anti-smoking activists for attackingthe crop which he said pumps $300 million, with the ripple effect,into the South Carolina economy.   ``If some of these people who are screaming and yelling did asmuch to fight illegal things _ if they shut down the marijuanafields and eliminated the dope _ instead of going and trying tobeat down something that's legal and has been forever in the UnitedStates this country would be a lot better off,'' he said.   ``We've got a good quality crop,'' said DeWitt Gooden, a tobaccospecialist with the Clemson Extension Service. ``While weatherconditions haven't been ideal this season, recent rains have filledout the tops of the crop.''   There were strong opening day sales on Georgia-Florida marketslast week _ with prices averaging $136.59 per hundredweight. That'sup $8.70 from last year.   Cooler weather than normal during the spring left this year'scrop about a week behind, Tindal said earlier. ``What we have to donow is to convince the growers to leave their crop in the fielduntil it's fully mature,'' he said.   While there are more acres of soybeans than any other cropplanted in the state, tobacco is stil king in sales, said SonnySmith of the South Carolina Agriculture Department.   Tobacco brought in $156.1 million last year, and soybeans justover $91 million.</TEXT></DOC>
