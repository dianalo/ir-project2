Garcia</HL><DD> 05/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   The rapid rise in interest rates since late March is turning off some people who have invested in stocks. They are selling shares and hoarding cash, with a few already hunting for bargains in the bond market.    The move away from stocks accelerated Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 52.97 to 2272.52. It was the fourth-largest point decline in the history of the industrial average.    &quot;There were a lot of reasons not to buy stocks,&quot; said Peter Furniss, a managing director with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York. Traders said they saw few buyers for stocks Friday. On the New York Stock Exchange, 1,378 stocks lost ground while just 291 advanced.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index sank 6.81 to 287.43 and the Big Board's composite index dropped 3.51 to 162.25.    For stock investors, a litany of negative news Friday fanned fears of surging inflation and much higher interest rates. Producer prices jumped an unexpectedly sharp 0.7% in April and major banks raised their prime lending rates to 8 1/4% from 8%. It was the third increase in the prime rate in seven weeks, with the previous one just two weeks earlier.    The bond market plunged, with the long-term Treasury bond sinking two points. The dollar weakened and commodity prices again moved higher. The sell-off in the stock market was exaggerated in the final hour of trading Friday as some investors sold stocks against some expiring options and futures contracts.    As Wall Streeters headed home late Friday, sentiment was bearish. &quot;I can't give you a single reason why (stock prices) should go up on Monday,&quot; said Jack Baker, the head of capital commitment at Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York. He believes major institutional investors could be aggressive sellers of stocks on more negative news this week.    The stock market had to cope with a major seller Friday. Renaissance Investment Management in Cincinnati sold the majority of its current stock positions Friday, according to S. William Miller, a managing director of the firm. He says the firm's valuation model &quot;turned the corner on stock attractiveness&quot; Friday. Mr. Miller said the firm manages $1.25 billion in assets, but he declined to give details on how much was sold or where the money would be invested because the sell program wasn't completed.    Analysts said the stock market's reaction has been somewhat subdued, considering the gain of 1 5/8 percentage points in long-term rates since late March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average peaked at 2405.54 April 6, fell to almost 2230 in late April, but then bounced up before resuming its slide with a vengeance Friday.    While the bond market plummeted in the past seven weeks, the stock market's fall has been cushioned by reports showing healthy gains in corporate profits and by expectations that these earnings will keep rising in 1987. There has been brisk demand for some cyclical stocks amid forecasts of a stronger economy later this year.    The rapid rate rise now makes the stock market look vulnerable. It also suggests to many portfolio managers that more attractive returns now lie with fixed-income securities. Yet the still turbulent outlook for bonds renders these portfolio managers as somewhat queasy about adding bonds to their portfolios.    &quot;I do buy the earnings argument,&quot; says John Connolly, market strategist with Dean Witter Reynolds. Corporate profits &quot;are going to be strong this year. But interest rates are a factor, too. I can get a pretty competitive yield (compared with stocks) by just walking into any bank in New York City.&quot;    He believes the stock market is vulnerable because share prices have yet to adjust to the current higher interest rates. And while &quot;bonds probably offer a better value than stocks,&quot; Mr. Connolly says he's cautious about making a wholesale move into bonds because he's still worried about the chance of further declines in bond prices.    &quot;Money will eventually seek the highest return consistent with risks. The risk is lower in cash&quot; for the time being, Mr. Connolly believes.    David Printy, president of Morison Asset Management in Minneapolis, shares his view. In early April, he reduced his stock holdings to 40% from 60% of the balanced portfolios he manages; the money went into money market instruments such as high-quality commercial paper and bank certificates of deposit.    &quot;One of the worst things we could experience right now is rising interest rates and a slowdown in the economy,&quot; he said. Mr. Printy fears that if investors start to believe there's even a remote chance of a recession, the stock market could be in for a nasty surprise.    Art Micheletti, director of U.S. research at Bailard, Biehl andamp; Kaiser in San Francisco, said the firm began to sell some stocks in its portfolio about three weeks ago because of the continued climb in rates. When comparing relative returns for stocks with long bond and money-market instruments, he says, &quot;What was a fairly valued market in stocks is now overvalued.&quot;    The portfolio managers at Bailard Biehl like to take a long-term view of the economy and markets, looking ahead four years. Their current forecast indicates bonds could provide an annual 13% total return, in price appreciation and coupon interest, over the next four years while stocks could drop 6% each year.    Timing is the dicey question facing many a portfolio manager right now. Mr. Micheletti says if rates ease or bond prices stabilize, he's likely to move money into the bond market because &quot;that's the area where we see value.&quot;    Lulu C. Wang, a managing director at Equitable Investment Management Corp. in New York, pulled off some nimble moves. In her balanced accounts, she sold bonds in early April and put the cash in money market instruments, some stocks and convertible securities.    Now she's beginning to look at bonds again because her outlook for inflation isn't nearly as dire as that of some investors. Because she believes some stocks are overpriced, given current rates, Ms. Wang plans to stick with stocks that have prospects for strong earnings growth. </TEXT></DOC>
