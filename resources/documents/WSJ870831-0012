Friday demanded concessions from the United Auto Workers in so many sacred areas that the union may decide it can reach a better pact first at Ford Motor Co., some union officials say.    The UAW's 23-member executive board will choose today which company will be the target for a settlement or possible strike when the contracts expire Sept. 14. UAW President Owen Bieber, whose recommendation the board will almost certainly follow, declined at a news conference Saturday to say which way he is leaning, so either GM or Ford could emerge as the target. If tradition holds, the UAW, after negotiating successfully with the target, will try to reach a similar agreement at the other company.    GM, which is struggling with high costs and slipping market share, asked the UAW for many sacrifices beyond what the company had indicated earlier. They range from wage cuts in non-competitive plants to new restrictions in privileges untouched for decades -- including overtime pay and relief time. The No. 1 auto maker said the total package would be worth $1.4 billion over three years, and that by 1990 the proposed contract would increase its annual blue-collar labor costs by 6% to $19.1 billion.    The highly profitable Ford, as previously reported, floated a general proposal Thursday that didn't offer any major improvements but asked no concessions. And some union officials interpret the Ford statement as hinting that Ford is willing to offer guaranteed employment for the current work force. Job security is the union's top priority in these talks.    The sharp contrast between the two proposals has fueled speculation among UAW officials that Ford will be the union's target because they think the initial offers indicate the union can get a better contract there. Some union leaders still insist, however, that they should go after GM first because it has bigger problems. The target is the company with which the union picks to negotiate a contract by the expiration of the current pacts. It also is the target for a possible strike should negotiations fail, while the non-target company usually gets an indefinite contract extension without a walkout. Chrysler Corp.'s contract with the UAW doesn't expire until 1988.    It's unclear, however, whether the target company will set a pattern settlement, because Ford is far more profitable than GM. One indication that pattern bargaining may be breaking down is the wide differences between the two auto makers' initial proposals. In the past, both companies have presented virtually identical offers on the same day.    The companies and the union are bargaining to save what they can in an increasingly competitive market. In a striking illustration of the challenge they face, Mazda Motor Corp. tomorrow starts production at its new assembly plant in Flat Rock, Mich. Mazda joins Honda Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. on the growing list of Japanese companies opening auto plants in the U.S.    In its presentation to the union Friday, GM stressed again two main themes that it has hammered at repeatedly since the talks started July 27. GM said it needs a different agreement than Ford because GM is more vertically integrated -- meaning it makes more parts in-house -- and that workers in parts plants need to make greater sacrifices because they are in a more competitive market. Even some UAW leaders privately accept those points. But they were shocked by the range of GM's demands.    &quot;There are far too many negatives in (the proposal) indicating a total lack of understanding of this process,&quot; UAW vice president Donald F. Ephlin complained at a news conference. &quot;I don't think it is in any fashion the framework on which an agreement can be put together. We have said and we continue to say that we understand the problems that exist at GM at the moment. But they cannot be solved by turning back the clock.&quot;    GM's proposal included many concessions that it previously requested, such as frozen or reduced cost-of-living-adjustment payments, a lower wage for newly hired workers, and smaller compensation for workers in parts plants. The company also said it wanted to freeze the base wage during the contract, and pay instead annual lump-sum payments equal to 2% of pay.    But it also included some surprises. In addition to the possible wage cuts at some plants, the company said it wanted to cut daily relief time -- or breaks -- to 36 minutes from 46 minutes and to eliminate Saturday overtime pay for workers who miss another day during the week. The union won those points in the 1950s and 1960s. &quot;The best I can recall, this is the first time they ever made those proposals,&quot; one UAW official said. &quot;They didn't propose that even in 1982 when they were going down the tubes.&quot;    GM did make some positive offers to the union. It said it would change its profit-sharing formula to the more generous one used by Ford, and that it would increase pension benefits and early retirement incentives.    It also proposed a new committee to &quot;extend the scope of union input regarding people decisions to the highest level of the corporation.&quot;    &quot;Obviously the proposal that GM made isn't the basis for a settlement,&quot; Mr. Bieber said at the Saturday press conference. But he quickly added that &quot;neither is the one at Ford.&quot;    The press conference was called to unveil a new UAW television advertising campaign in selected markets nationwide attacking U.S. companies for transferring work abroad. Mr. Bieber said the two-week, $2.5 million campaign wasn't directly related to the contract talks, but one commercial does conclude: &quot;At the UAW we're bargaining to make American families and communities America's first order of business.&quot;    It is the UAW's fifth national advertising campaign. The union also ran commercials during the 1984 negotiations. </TEXT></DOC>
