<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-74-0081 </DOCNO><TEXT>An atomic structure package based on the numerical MC SCF procedure isoutlined. The main objective of the package is the determination of energylevels and wave functions for atomic systems from which other atomicproperties can be predicted. Particular attention has been given to electronaffinities or binding energies, transition probabilities, autoionizationrates, and lifetimes of excited states. The basic calculations are non-relativistic,but they may be extended to include relativistic effects through theBreit-Pauli approximation. The latter allows the study of fine-structuresplitting as well as term energy separation. As an example, the calculationof the spin-forbidden 2p{sup 4} {sup 1}D{sub 2} -- 2p{sup 3}3s {sup 3}S{sub1} transition rate in oxygen will be outlined. These programs were usedrecently to predict the existence of a stable Ca{sup {minus}} ion inthe 4s{sup 2}4p {sup 2}P state. The electron affinity resulting fromthese calculations was in excellent agreement with experiment. The packagealso has been extended to include the continuum problem. Of special interestwere the resonances that appear in the continuum, as in the photoionizationcross-section of magnesium near the ionization threshold. Numerical proceduresproved to be unstable and spline algorithms are being designed to dealwith this difficulty. 17 refs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
