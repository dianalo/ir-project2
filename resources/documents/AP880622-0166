A search of the area failed to produce evidence of damage, andthe intruding ship apparently escaped, said an armed forcesstatement.   The incident was one of nine live-fire engagements in the lasttwo months between the Anti-Submarine Warfare unit and suspectedforeign vessels from unidentified countries.   On two of those occasions the sub hunters found they had blastedsubmarine-shaped rocks, said armed forces spokesman H.G. Wessberg.   Sweden has reported underwater snoopers every summer for thelast decade. It refuses to say whom it suspects for the violationsof its territorial waters.   But it has accused the Soviet Union twice, once in 1981 when aSoviet sub grounded near Sweden's largest naval base at Karlskrona,and after a series of incidents the following year. Moscow hasdenied it has recently intruded into Swedish waters.   The military statement _ its first communique issued since theincidents _ also indicated that the rules-of-engagement were beingrelaxed to give commanders on the scene the power to decide when toopen fire.   ``This is necessary to get results, and at the same time toincrease the risk for an intruding power,'' the statement said.``Our anti-submarine activities have continuously improved,'' itsaid.   Ship commanders previously needed higher authority to open fireand were required to warn suspected intruders that they could befired upon.   Defense analysts believe neutral Sweden is growing moreimportant in the war planning of both the NATO alliance and theWarsaw Pact as both sides focus more attention on the naval theaterof the northern seas.   The Swedish-Danish straits control the bottleneck into theBaltic Sea, along which the Soviet Union has a network of dry docksfor maintenance and repair.   In one incident two weeks ago, Wessberg said, the sub huntersopened up on an intruder with more firepower than Sweden has everbeen used against a single target at sea.   The prowler was detected and trapped in 282 feet of water nearthe Gustav Dalen lighthouse off the city of Oxelsund, about 60miles south of Stockholm, he said in an interview.   Contact was lost amid the noise of exploding depth charges andunderwater grenades, and the sub apparently slipped away in theroil of water.   ``When we played back the tapes, we saw that the submarine wasexactly where we thought it was,'' Wessberg said, adding that``it's probable'' the ship was damaged.   In other incidents this year, the navy detonated remote-controlmines lacing the waters around sensitive bases, but failed to scoreany hits, he said. The navy was investigating the why the intrudersescaped apparently unharmed, he said.   Earlier this year the government approved a special allocationfor the unit of $83 million and an extra ship. It was the thirdtime since 1980 that extra money was earmarked for the unit,bringing the total to $333 million.   The unit is comprised of two Swedish-made corvettes, 12submarines, 7 mine-detector vessels, 16 patrol boats and 12sonar-equipped helicopters, Wessberg said.</TEXT></DOC>
