the report stated.andM;As the importance of process control systems grows, so will the dollar valueof the market, which includes hardware, applications, systems integration,maintenance and networking equipment, researchers said.andP;  The Yankee Groupestimates that the market will grow from $3.17 billion in 1988 to $6.42billion in 1993, a compounded growth rate of 15 percent.andM;DEC will ride this new wave of growth in the process control industry as itleverages its dominant position on the factory floor, said Keith Belton, aYankee Group researcher.andM;&quot;DEC is clearly in the driver's seat,&quot; Belton said.andP;  But as DEC moves intothe role of prime contractor, its cooperative relationships with third-partyplayers will become less and less clear, he said.andP;  &quot;So far, that's anunresolved issue,&quot; he said.andM;Hewlett-Packard, Fisher Control Systems, Honeywell and Oracle are also ingood positions to capitalize on the growth, according to Belton.andM;The mix of goods and services sold will undergo change as well, according toYankee researchers.andP;  Last year, the dollar value of a typical process controlinstallation was about 55 percent hardware.andP;  But by 1993, that will drop to42 percent.andP;  Process control hardware and system revenues were estimated at$2.14 billion for 1989 and will grow to $3.1 billion by the end of 1993--an11 percent compounded growth rate over five years.andM;The major forces behind market growth in the process control industry areusers needs to gain a competitive edge by attemptimg to control costs, therealization that data from process control systems can be turned into astrategic manufacturing decision support tool and the emergence of &quot;smartsensors&quot;--instruments that can handle more control strategy than a dedicatedcontrol device.andM;Beyond growth, the &quot;new age&quot; of process control will include an erosion ofthe wall between continuous-control and discrete-event control devices,researchers said.andP;  The multifunction controllers to come in the mid-1990swill provide services ranging from batch control to devicepolling--incorporating functions of the continuous-control and discrete-eventcontrol devices.andM;On the software front, object-oriented database technology should providesome productivity boosts for function-block and template-based controlconfigurations.andP;  for example, batch control could be improved with thedevelopment of standard, easily reconfigured batch control software,according to researchers.andM;Further changes include the expansion of process control systems thatencompass plantwide operations.andP;  Data from such systems will also beincorporated into management-level information systems, Yankee researcherssaid.andM;The role of the engineer or supervisor of a process control system willexpand as well.andP;  Such a person will have to oversee &quot;thousands of controlloops through hundreds of data points, as well as be more of a &quot;businesscontrol manager,&quot; responsible for picking the best method of control.andM;Process control users will link their systems to a distributed databasemanagement system (DDBMS) to integrate data from the shop floor with businessapplications, researchers said.andP;  Of those surveyed, three-quarters will havelinked process control systems to business applications by the end of thisyear.andP;  A huge majority of surveyed users, 82 percent, will link to a DDBMS.andM;A DDBMS would let users keep critical, site, process or hardware informationlogically separate for optimal performance levels in control, researcherssaid.andP;  In addition, a DDBMS would let minicomputer users query separatepockets of data and gather them when needed from the factory floor.andM;The DDBMS would also let factory-level users have more control over the typeand degree of information they need to capture and retrieve.andM;Yankee researchers also surveyed the criteria buyers use when shopping for aprocess control vendor, and found that service responsiveness was the topconcern.andP;  Next on their list was the vendor's focus and commitment to theindustry, followed by the vendor's years of experience.andM;The integration capabilities of a vendor's services and compatibility withother vendors' equipment were other major concerns.andM;Not major among the concerns of process control users were standards such asManufacturing Automation Protocol (MAP) and the Posix push for a portableoperating system standard.andM;Also on the horizon is the emergence of a standard field instrumentation busas an alternative to point-to-point transmitter wiring.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
