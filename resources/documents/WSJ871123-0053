Alluding to the market manipulation to which former Jefferies Group Inc. Chairman Boyd L. Jefferies pleaded guilty in April, Mr. Lynch said, &quot;It's fair to say that's not an isolated example,&quot; although he said later he doesn't think manipulation has been widespread on major markets. He wouldn't discuss who he thinks has been involved.    Separately, Richard Ketchum, who is the SEC's chief of market regulation and heads its investigation into Black Monday, questioned whether certain key specialists, or market makers, should remain independent. &quot;It's bad enough to worry about a wrenching day without worrying about the system buckling,&quot; he said.    Mr. Ketchum said his investigation focuses on the weaknesses of the specialist system and on whether portfolio insurance contributed to market volatility. He said the SEC will investigate whether the American Stock Exchange's Major Market Index was manipulated on Oct. 20, although he is skeptical that such manipulation occurred.    Mr. Lynch's comments were made at a meeting here of the American Bar Association's securities committee, which includes many of the lawyers who face him as adversaries.    In discussing market manipulation, Mr. Lynch referred to the charge in the Jefferies case that purchases were made before a large secondary offering to push the price up. But he specifically mentioned two other kinds of manipulation he suspects have occurred in recent years: depressing a stock price before an acquisition attempt is made, and raising a stock price to avoid a margin call.    Mr. Lynch said the SEC &quot;is having a problem really getting a handle&quot; on manipulation, particularly in thinly traded over-the-counter stocks &quot;where one market maker is dominating and controlling the market price of the security.&quot; Nonetheless, he said the agency plans more enforcement actions against manipulators, as well as accountants and lawyers who aid them.    Mr. Lynch also predicted more activity in the area of tender offer abuses. He said &quot;a number of investigations&quot; now under way look at possible violations of SEC rule 13D, which requires holders of more than 5% of a company's shares to disclose their stake.    He listed several kinds of violations: failure to disclose investment groups, &quot;arrangements between parties to compensate people for losses as a result of the positions they've taken,&quot; and parking, which is the purchase of stock by one investor for another who doesn't want to be identified. It can allow a raider to secretly amass a large position.    Mr. Lynch also said the SEC is investigating several cases of undisclosed &quot;perks and related-party transactions&quot; and will pursue more. He also plans to bring more cases of abuses by brokers.    Mr. Ketchum's comments about the stock market crash, which go beyond testimony by other SEC officials before Congress, were made in an ABA meeting on market structure and in a later interview. In the interview, Mr. Ketchum said he'd believed the meeting was closed and hadn't known a reporter was present. But he didn't attempt to alter what he'd said in the meeting.    Noting that many specialists would have been wiped out if stock prices had kept dropping on Oct. 20, he said, &quot;That strikes me as a bit close to the edge to run the structure of the securities system.&quot;    Specialists are members of the stock exchanges who maintain an orderly market in assigned securities. On Black Monday, many New York Stock Exchange specialists, who play one of the most important roles in the system, lacked adequate capital to fulfill their role by buying when demand plummets and selling when demand shoots up.    Mr. Ketchum also said that, in looking at independent specialists, who aren't affiliated with big, well-capitalized firms, the industry may have to consider &quot;the merger of key specialists into major firms.&quot; But he said he doesn't believe the specialist system is doomed. &quot;I'm not sure (the market plunge) demonstrated anything fundamentally wrong with the specialist system.&quot;    Mr. Ketchum said that in looking at the futures markets, the SEC is focusing on portfolio insurance, essentially a computerized form of hedging. The agency is most concerned by the effect of portfolio insurance, and its use of the futures markets, on institutional investors. The worry, he said, is that portfolio insurance has encouraged those investors to buy more stock than they would have otherwise, and on Oct. 19 caused them to sell it more quickly.    &quot;If money managers who used to be 50% invested in stock were now invested 90%, but were committed to sell much of their position with a 10% drop in the market, then that might suggest that the availability of futures and portfolio insurance contributed to volatility,&quot; Mr. Ketchum said.    He disputed the argument of some market observers that increased regulation of the futures markets, such as higher margin requirements, would push trading overseas. While new regulations would increase the cost of doing business for futures traders, Mr. Ketchum said, so would carrying out those transactions overseas.    He also said the SEC is looking at questions of manipulation of the market during the week of the crash. As this paper reported Friday, some knowledgeable traders argue that a few major firms manipulated the Amex's Major Market Index at midday Oct. 20 as part of an effort to boost the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But Mr. Ketchum said he questions &quot;whether an index that wasn't trading that actively had the ability to turn around the market on a 600 million-share day.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
