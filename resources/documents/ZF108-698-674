But these alliancesnot only failed to yield a single, unchallenged font standard for OS/2, theyeffectively squandered a far greater opportunity--the chance to make it easyto display, print, and transfer documents between computers of any type orsize.andM;For those of you who have misplaced your scorecard, the font battle lineshave been drawn as follows:  IBM decided earlier this year to use Adobe'sPostScript fonts and font-rendering technology as the standard for all of itscomputers--from PCs to mainframes.andP;  A few months before, Microsoft and Applehad agreed on a technology called Royal (now known as TrueType) that will beincorporated into the next release of OS/2, Windows, and Apple's System 7.0operating system.andP;  TrueType is also expected to be used in aPostScript-compatible printer language called TrueImage, which Apple andpossibly others plan to use in future laser printers.andM;Strangely enough, these arrangements pit OS/2 partners IBM and Microsoftagainst one another and make foes of former PostScript partners Apple andAdobe.andP;  But wait--it gets worse.andP;  Hewlett-Packard, whose LaserJet printersdominate the laser-printer market, is going its own way with a technologycalled Intellifont, a system developed by typography leader AgfaCompugraphic.andM;The result, of course, is no clear direction for the future of fonts.andP;  Nowthe talk has turned to an &quot;open font standard,&quot; which is techno-doublespeakfor: &quot;We didn't sit down and work this thing out, so we'll agree to disagreeand support different font technologies as best we can.&quot;andP;  In other words, thevery state of confusion we were hoping to avoid in the first place.andM;Admittedly, there may be little reason for concern in the short run.andP;  MostDOS and Windows applications will continue to expand their support for screenand printer fonts, while OS/2 remains well within the realm of theexperimental for most of us.andP;  And as all of the feuding fontsters are quickto point out, every program or printer that works today will continue to workjust fine as the various font strategies are deployed.andM;But this complacency diverts our attention from the bigger picture and theimportance of what these corporate alliances do--and fail to do--for thefuture of computing.andP;  What's at stake is great: the way we'll createdocuments, how they'll appear on paper, and who we'll be able to share themwith.andM;Had the powers-that-be agreed upon a single standard for displaying andprinting fonts, we'd find ourselves in the dawn of a new era in whichdocuments are effortlessly passed from PC to Mac to mini to mainframe withall of their special formats and niceties intact, ready to be accuratelydisplayed or printed at any step along the way.andP;  Instead, we find ourselvesfacing more of the same: needless barriers across computing platforms.andM;This is not just a word-processing or a desktop-publishing issue.andP;  Thedocuments in question also include database reports, presentation graphics,and yes, spreadsheet models.andP;  (Remember how irrelevant the appearance ofspreadsheets seemed until products like Allways and Excel came along?)andM;What's really frustrating is that we were so tantalizingly close to achievingthat new era.andP;  Microsoft and Apple, both of whom were miffed at Adobe's stifflicensing fees and strict control of PostScript, no sooner struck a deal thanAdobe said it would go public with the PostScript.andP;  At the same time, IBM wastelling anyone who'd listen that it had to protect its customers' interestsin PostScript, a pledge it kept by choosing Adobe technology as the fontstandard for its Systems Application Architecture (SAA).andP;  HP, meanwhile, wasreadying its new LaserJet III with an optional PostScript cartridge, as wellas Intellifont.andM;Is there anyone who doesn't believe that IBM, Microsoft, Apple, and HP couldcollectively have hastened Adobe's change of heart and agreed to pursue apublic domain PostScript rather than separate paths?andP;  We will all suffer theeffects of these companies' failure to look beyond their quarterly earningsreports.andM;Christopher O'Malley is a free-lance writer based in Delray Beach, Fla.andP;  anda frequent contributor to LOTUS.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
