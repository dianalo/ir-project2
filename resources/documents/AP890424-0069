The Nisshin Maru No. 3's return marked the end of the secondyear of Japan's research whaling program, which it launched afterofficially ending commercial whaling in 1987 to comply with a banimposed by the International Whaling Commission.   In a welcoming ceremony on the ship's long, rusted deck,officials promised the 120 crew members they would seek an end tothe ban, which is to be re-evaluated in 1990.   ``I understand that you had many difficulties on your voyage,''Fukujiro Kikuchi, a Parliament member, told the crew. ``We're doingour best in the hope that sometime, somewhere Japan will be able toresume commercial whaling.''   Below the 23,000-ton ship's deck were 241 minke whales alreadyprepared into meat in the vessel's processing plant.   When Japanese whaling was at its peak in the early 1960s, whalesprovided 23 percent of all meat consumed in the country. Decliningsupplies since then have turned whale meat into a delicacy, butJapan is still the world's largest consumer of whale flesh.   Under the International Whaling Commission charter, membernations may conduct research whaling at any time without permissionfrom the commission and then use the meat. Japan says it hopes toshow through its research that some whale species are plentifulenough to allow a resumption of limited commercial whaling.   Estimates of the current number of minkes, a smaller species,range from 400,000 to 700,000.   But international environmental groups such as Greenpeace havecharged that Japan is using the research provision as a ploy tocontinue whaling, and that non-lethal research methods areavailable.   Greenpeace members used a ship and rubber rafts to try to blockthe Nisshin Maru and its three catcher boats during their hunt inthe Antarctic, and had one minor collision with the mother ship.   Hidehiro Kato, director of research on board the Nisshin Maru,said the voyage had shown that the random sampling methods used inthe research could be applied to a broader research program.   ``I'd prefer to use non-lethal methods, but they aren't able totell us age, reproductive status or condition of the whales,'' hesaid. ``At this point, the best approach is a combination of lethaland non-lethal research.''   Japanese officials have said at least 825 whales must be caughteach season to make the research program scientifically accurate.But because of strong international opposition, they reduced thisyear's goal to 300.   Kato said bad weather was primarily responsible for the fleet'sfalling short of the goal, but that the protests ``had someeffect.''   ``The research whaling was approved by the Japanesegovernment,'' said Hideyoshi Yoshida, a crew member. ``So I wishpeople opposed to it would discuss it with the government, ratherthan confronting us while we're whaling.''   Yoshida sats he took a year off from a fisheries college for achance to work on the ship and visit the Antarctic.</TEXT></DOC>
