At the time, there were 32 inches of snow on the ground _ but itwas worse than that, because the winds had whipped the flakes intodrifts that blanketed every house in town, covering everything butthe rooftops.   One two-story drift blocked the entrance to the town's onlyhotel. To escape, the adventurous burrowed through a narrow tunneldug by hotel workers.   No thing _ but snow.   The Blizzard of 1888 arrived on March 11 as a soft, gentle rainin the last days of winter. No one expected anything more; theforecasts called for clearing, balmier weather from Washington toBoston.   Three days later, the blizzard ended with corpses encased insnowbanks, telegraph and electric wires tangled, stranded commuterssleeping on hotel billiard tables, train schedules tossed to thevery considerable winds, and myriad tales of heroism, tragedy,hilarity, enterprise and outright miracles.   One hundred years later, the Blizzard of '88 remains frozen inmemory, though its remaining survivors are few. Two new books markthe storm's centenary _ ``Blizzard! The Great Storm of '88,'' byJudd Caplovich, and ``The Blizzard of 1888,'' by Mary Cable.   These books, along with memoirs and newspaper accounts of thetime, depict a world set on its ear by the elements.   Some estimated accumulations: Saratoga Springs, N.Y., 50 inches;Bennington, Vt., 48; Blooming Grove, Pa., 31; Pittsfield, Mass.,36; New Haven, Conn., 45; Dublin, N.H., 42.   Only 21 inches fell on New York City, but that is a deceptivetotal. In many ways, the nation's largest city was hardest hit.   ``A great white hurricane roared all day through New Yorkyesterday and turned the comfortable city into a wild andbewildering waste of snow and ice. ... No one living can remembersuch a storm,'' wrote the New York Herald.   A combination of 19th-century work ethic and fear of firing ledthousands to make their way to their jobs.   Most of them had to travel on foot; horse-drawn street cars wereabandoned everywhere, elevated trains stalled for hours (one trainslid into another on ice-slickened tracks, killing an engineer),and cabbies charged as much as $50 a ride _ the equivalent of $600in 1988. IF they could find the way.   ``Sa-a-ay Billy! Where in blazes are we?'' said one hack toanother, as the two cabs stood on Broadway near 13th Street.   ``I'm blankety-blanked if I can see. We're near Union Squareanyway,'' his friend replied, according to the Herald.   George D. Baremore, a trader in hops, left his home on West 57thStreet and set out for his office at the Battery. He walked to theSixth Avenue el, waited for an hour, and then tried to walk to theNinth Avenue el.   He never made it. A day later, a police officer saw a handsticking out of a drift on Seventh Avenue. Baremore's frozen bodywas buried there.   The most famous casualty was Roscoe Conkling, politicalpowerbroker and former U.S. senator from New York. Conkling refusedto pay $50 forthe courts to his home on Madison Square.   It took him more than three hours to walk 2{ miles; at onepoint, he was stuck in a drift for 20 minutes. He collapsed and wascarried to his hotel; by the weekend, he had pneumonia and an earinfection. He died April 18.   Those who made it to work found they had little to do. B.Altman's department store had only one customer all day _ anelderly woman who braved snow and 50-mph winds to buy two spools ofthread. At Tony Pastor's theater, the eight performers outnumberedthe audience of four. But the show went on.   Not surprisingly, a fair amount of partying went on. ``The smellof malt all along the line was almost enough to knock one down,''one man recalled.   The entrepreneurial spirit thrived. Shovelers, most of themimmigrant Italians, demanded and got $10 a day. Ladders were totedto elevated tracks to rescue passengers _ the ladder fee reached $2per person. The hotels filled, and rented every bit of space _ pooltables, closets, stairwells.   Food and coal were in short supply. Provisions, where they couldbe found, had to be tossed up through second-story windows. Andwhere provisions could not be found, New Yorkers made do.   ``Hundreds of sparrows took refuge under kitchen porches andwere frozen or easily caught and cooked for food,'' one writerrecalls.   Country folks adapted better; most were amply provisioned, moreaccustomed to dealing with the elements, less dependent on modernconveniences. This is not to say that there were no deaths: InMilltown, N.J., a man went to get a doctor for his sick wife, losthis way and froze to death; by the time someone reached the house,the wife had died.   In Danbury, Conn., a man stumbled on what appeared to be a bodyin the snow. He ran screaming to a saloon; the patrons emerged andbegan digging.   When they finished, they found they had rescued a woodencigar-store Indian that had blown over in the storm.   In Lewes, Del., 25 ships were hurled across the harbor bygale-force winds. Two vessels sank.   Hundreds of trains were bogged down in the snow. Food and drinkwas procured from local people where possible; when a train wasmired near Brookfield, Conn., the stationmaster managed to scroungeenough food so that each passenger got an egg and two slices ofbread.   To pass the hours, some played cards, and others knitted.Theatrical troupes, stuck en route to engagements, performed in theaisles; one was touring with a play entitled, ``Lost in the Snow.''   Signs placed in snowbanks in New York: ``The flowers that bloomin the snow, ha ha'' (with a bunch of flowers). ``This way toCanada.'' ``This bliz knocks biz.''   In the end, 400 people and uncounted numbers of horses and otherlivestock died in the blizzard, and damages were estimated at $20million. A thaw that arrived a few days later brought flooding.   The blizzard convinced New York and other cities to buildsubways. It also pushed utility wires in New York underground,where they remain.   As the years passed, some survivors of the blizzard looked backon those days with fondness. Rose B. Capone of Long Island City,born during the snowfall, was proud of her middle name: Blizzard.   Starting in 1929, survivors formed the Society of Blizzard Menand Women. They met yearly through the 1960s, an ever-diminishingband of snow veterans who lamented the passing of their personalIce Age.   ``We blizzard survivors are not only organizing to keep alivethe traditions of the storm but we are sick and tired of all thismodernity and want to go back to the days when we New Yorkers livedsimply and got our fun out of simple things,'' said one stalwartBlizzard Man.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Feb. 28</NOTE></DOC>
