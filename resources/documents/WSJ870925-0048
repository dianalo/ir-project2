Mr. Smith declined to make specific forecasts, but said he expects the second half of this year to be &quot;as strong as the first half,&quot; when the company earned 135 million dollars, or 1.22 dollars a share.    In 1986, the forest products concern had operating income of 133.3 million dollars, or 1.07 dollars a share. A 45 million dollar gain from the sale of part of the company's interest in a Dutch pulp and paper concern made net income 178.3 million dollars, or 1.55 dollars a share. Mr. Smith said he doesn't expect any one-time items this year.    The expected per-share earnings this year are proportionately higher than the net income gains, because of an expected reduction in preferred share dividend payments to about 20 million dollars from 33.5 million dollars last year.    In an interview, Mr. Smith attributed the anticipated profit gains this year to higher product prices and increased output of lumber, pulp and newsprint. Last year, production was curtailed by a strike of British Columbia forestry workers. Mr. Smith also noted that the company has become more efficient, operating with 40% fewer employees.    Mr. Smith indicated that revenue for the year would be about three billion dollars, up 20% from 2.5 billion dollars a year earlier. &quot;I see no reason why it won't be as good&quot; in the second half as the first half, when the company had 1.5 billion dollars of revenue, he said.    MacMillan Bloedel is forecasting output this year of one billion board feet of lumber, up 19% from a year earlier; 480,000 metric tons of pulp, up 17.6%; and 960,000 tons of newsprint, up 9.6%.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, MacMillan Bloedel shares closed at $20.125 a share, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
