But I won't, because these problems are tooinconsequential when the (Soviet) soldiers are doing what they like here.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LITHUANIANS FEAR ANTI-MOSCOW UNITY IS ONLYTEMPORARY  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     One of those troubling issues is the fear held by minority Jews and ethnicRussians and Poles, some of whom believe they may face discrimination in anindependent republic dominated by ethnic Lithuanians. But most other criticshave avoided questioning the government of President Vytautas Landsbergissince the Soviet military crackdown last month.;    Lithuania still is reelingfrom the 14 dead and more than 200 injured when Soviet troops stormed abroadcasting tower. The republic's leaders fear that the relative quiet of thelast few weeks from the Kremlin will be broken Saturday, when citizens take tothe polls to register their opinion on the republic's independence drive.;   The Landsbergis government, which swept Communists from power here last yearon the platform of an independent Lithuania, expects an overwhelming vote infavor of its policies.;    Earlier this week, Soviet President MikhailGorbachev issued a decree rejecting the legitimacy of a planned plebiscite,saying dissolution of the Soviet Union would result in dramatically worsestandards of living. He called for a Moscow-sponsored referendum to replacesuch independence polls.;    Since then, several news reports on Moscowtelevision have portrayed the independence leaders in Lithuania as a smallband of provocateurs leading the republic to the verge of civil war.;    Thatsort of pre-glasnost style propaganda has the government here on alert.Hundreds of young men guard the parliament building night and day, sleepingbehind piles of sandbags and makeshift barriers erected around and throughoutthe building. The brave stance, however, is only a symbolic gesture, becausethe young men readily admit that this feeble defense would be crushed easilyby a Soviet military onslaught.;    Outside, bonfires burn all night, warminggroups of independence supporters, who sing Lithuanian folk songs and, underthe glaring floodlights, paint murals on the massive concrete blocks piledhigh to fortify the government center.;    Despite the images of a unifiedpeople, there is already a growing indifference among many Lithuanians. Havingembraced independence as a way to improve their lives, they since have onlysuffered increased deprivation. To stanch this alienation, leaders say theyneed somehow to get the Lithuanian economy up and running.;    &quot;It's like anacrobat on a line, balancing with a baton in either hand in order to keep hisbalance,&quot; Lithuanian deputy prime minister Vitas Pakalniskis said. &quot;Thebalance is so that in the one hand are the democratic movements in the SovietUnion and in the other the active policy of the West. That is what keeps usfrom falling off the wire, from losing power.;    &quot;But the wire on which weare balancing is held by our people, and when they lose their confidence in usthey will let the wire fall,&quot; Pakalniskis said. &quot;In order to give themconfidence, we must improve our economic situation and give them hope that wecan achieve the independence we seek.&quot;;    The Lithuanian government has beenstymied for more than a year in its effort to strengthen its declaredindependence, working overtime to fend off the intermittent volleys fromMoscow and lagging behind in instituting a comprehensive program of reform.;   The government is losing 6 million rubles a day (nearly $10 million U.S. atthe official rate) on goods imported from Moscow. Although Lithuania producesmuch of its own food, it depends heavily on Moscow for raw materials and fuelto run its industries, including its large electronics component factories.;   Several months ago, Moscow increased the prices of goods it sends toLithuania, but the republic's leaders have stalled in passing those increasesalong to the public, worried about an outcry in these tense times.;   Legislators for most of a year also have been debating reforms to encourageprivatization of industry in the republic, but they have failed to pass theminto law.;    &quot;During the past year, we have made a lot of laws, but that'snot enough,&quot; Lithuanian vice president Bronius Kuzmickas said. &quot;It's like agood road on which there are no cars. In order for our laws to run, we needour own financial system and control of our own property. All of this mustbegin with successful talks with Moscow and with foreign investment.&quot;;    Buttalks with Moscow have broken down several times. And, with the memory of lastmonth's brutality fresh here, the development of a coherent economic andpolitical strategy has taken a back seat to survival. The result is agovernment that observers say seems adrift -- focused on lofty legislationwhile its debt mounts at a precipitous rate.;    &quot;We work on different draftsof laws here, we talk about price rises, but we can't do anything immediatelybecause we don't know how Moscow will try to use (such moves)&quot; to wean controlfrom the leadership, said Arudas Degutas, a deputy in the LithuanianParliament.;    &quot;We are working on privatization laws, but nobody knows whatthe direction will be from Moscow. It's waiting and waiting -- and not knowingwhat will be.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ESTHER SCHRADER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Vilnius, Lithuania  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910208  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  929  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday February 8, 199100039102,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
