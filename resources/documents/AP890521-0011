WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Richard von Weizsaecker'spatrician lineage and eloquent oratory satisfy a longing of hiscountrymen for a royal statesman who can skillfully temper theirpast sins with postwar achievements.   His rise from the shadow of his father's role in the Nazileadership to what is now the most respected federal office mirrorsthe stunning West German recovery from wartime ruin and testifiesto the resilience of a modern family dynasty.   Weizsaecker will be re-elected without opposition Tuesday to asecond term as head of state by the Federal Convention, which meetsevery five years to elect a president.   Each of the five political parties represented in the federalParliament is entitled to nominate a candidate, but for the firsttime in the nation's 40-year history, the vote will be uncontested.   Weizsaecker, a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservativeChristian Democratic Union, has won endorsement of all but thefar-left Greens Party, which nonetheless decided against running achallenger.   The unusual unity displayed by West Germany's diverse andfractious political parties reflects the respect the 69-year-oldWeizsaecker has won during his first term as president.   In the latest nationwide poll, conducted by the Institute forOpinion Research in Allensbach, Weizsaecker drew an approval ratingof more than 85 percent.   A man who by nature keeps above the political fray, Weizsaeckerhas transformed the mostly ceremonial office of president into aninfluential post of elder statesman and curator of a nationalconscience.   His articulate address on the 40th anniversary of the end ofWorld War II won praise worldwide as an effort to bring fellowGermans to terms with the Holocaust they perpetrated.   ``Guilt is, like innocence, not collective, but personal,'' thepresident said. ``All of us, whether guilty or not, whether youngor old, must accept the past. We are all affected by itsconsequences and liable for it.''   But striking a chord of balance with West Germans weary of theshame bequeathed by their forebears, Weizsaecker also has calledfor a fair assessment of the accomplishments of his state built onthe smoldering ruins of the Third Reich.   Chapters of his own past have been a burden borne unflinchingly.   Born in Stuttgart on April 15, 1920, to a titled family ofintellectuals, Weizsaecker began his studies in 1937 at Oxford,where he perfected the English he speaks fluently today, thenjoined Adolf Hitler's army in 1938.   He marched into Poland with his infantry regiment on the firstday of World War II, lost a brother in the invasion and continuedto serve until the German capitulation May 8, 1945.   After resuming his law studies, he served as deputy defensecouncil for his father, Ernst von Weizsaecker, who was sentenced atthe 1947 Nuremberg trials to eight years in prison for his role asa deputy foreign minister in the Nazi leadership.   While Weizsaecker is generally revered by West Germans, criticscan be found at both political extremes.   Ultra-rightist leader Franz Schoenhuber, whose service in theWaffen SS continues to haunt his political career, complainedrecently that he is called to account repeatedly for the Naziperiod while Weizsaecker ``has remained virtually untouched.''   Greens spokesman Michael Schroerer said his party, which pollsless than 10 percent, declined to support Weizsaecker ``more forwhat he hasn't done than for any misdeed,'' contending thepresident could more actively address residual problems ofdiscrimination and injustice.   Some prominent Greens like Otto Schily, however, have said theyplan to vote for Weizsaecker.   Ingeborg Menz of the federal Parliament office explained thatthe Federal Convention at which the president will be elected for asecond and final term is made up of the 519 federal Parliamentmembers and an equal number of delegates from the 11 statelegislatures.   An avid sportsman frequently pictured skiing ormountain-climbing, Weiszaecker is chosen most often as a model foryoung Germans, said spokesman Edgar Piel of the Institute forOpinion Research.   Piel said West Germans respect Weizsaecker because of his imageas a moral and noble statesman, allowing them to maintain an ersatzmonarchy.   The ``von'' in the family name stems from the title of baronbestowed on his grandfather in 1916 by the royal family ofWuerttemberg.   After managerial stints in steel, banking and pharmaceuticals,Weizsaecker was head of the German Protestant Church from 1964 to1970. He served in the federal Parliament from 1969 through hiselection as mayor of West Berlin, a high-profile post thatpropelled him into the presidency in 1984.   Weizsaecker has traveled frequently since his election,including making the first West German presidential visit to Israelin 1985, helping to mold the nation's affluent and sophisticatedpostwar image.</TEXT></DOC>
