In a news conference in his adopted hometown of Houston, Bushsaid, ``We differ, the governor and I, a great deal on domestic andforeign affairs.'' He said he was eager to spell out thosedifferences because ``I am convinced the country doesn't want toswing left.''   Bush, who wrapped up the GOP nomination in April, met in Houstonwith the Hispanic caucus to the Texas Republican convention, thenwent to the convention floor to address the delegates.   In his speech, the vice president branded Dukakis an``out-of-mainstream'' politician with a ``flawed world view.''   ``He's...old-style 60's liberalism,'' Bush said of hisDemocratic rival. He said Dukakis would raise taxes, harassAmericans with IRS audits, weaken national defense and formulate anisolatinist foreign policy.   The Dukakis camp quickly fired back, defending Dukakis' recordon crime and his plan to collect unpaid taxes before consideringtax hikes.   ``It's clear that the vice president doesn't think that his ownrecord or vision can bring him the votes he needs in November,''said Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach.   Recent polls show the vice president trailing Dukakis by 10points or more, but Bush said he wasn't worried. ``I feel reallyrelaxed about it,'' he said. ``I really do. We're not play-actinghere. I like fighting back.''   In Boston, Dukakis, who mathematically locked up the Democraticnomination with a four-state primary sweep on Tuesday, held hissecond meeting with Costa Rican President Oscar Arias in as manymonths. He urged the U.S. government to encourage democracy inCentral America through economic assistance rather than militaryforce.   ``We did have an opportunity once again to talk about concernsthat he has and I have and all of us have about Central America,about his leadership in bringing peace to the region and about theopportunity economically for development,'' Dukakis said.   The Massachusetts governor promised that if elected he would``develop a new relationship based on respect'' with the leaders ofCentral America.   Arias, asked by reporters if he wanted to endorse Dukakis, said,``I'm sure we'll be a good friend of whoever you decide to elect.''However, noting Dukakis' ability to speak Spanish fluently, Ariasadded, ``Perhaps it's easier, we can get along in the samelanguage. That helps.''   Dukakis' discussion with Arias, who won the 1987 Nobel PeacePrize for his Central American peace plan, also included currentU.S. problems with Panamanian ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   Dukakis, speaking in Spanish to a reporter traveling with Arias,said attempts to remove Noriega should involve consultation withCentral American leaders _ consultation he said the administrationhas neglected.   Arias and Dukakis also took part in commencement ceremonies atHarvard University, where the Costa Rican president delivered thekeynote address and the governor joined the school's procession.   Earlier in the day, Dukakis escorted his wife, Kitty, home fromMassachusetts General Hospital, where she underwent surgery sixdays ago to repair two herniated discs in her neck.   Doctors said she will have to wear a neck brace while sherecuperates, but will be allowed to remove the brace by the timeher husband formally receives the nomination at the DemocraticNational Convention in July.   Outside the hospital, Dukakis refused to answer reporters'questions about rival Jesse Jackson's contention that Jackson'sstrong showing in the primaries warrants a vice presidential offer.Dukakis said Wednesday that Jackson will be considered but nocandidate is ``due an offer.''   Jackson met Thursday with his advisers at the La Costa resort inCalifornia, where the candidate was resting after a gruelingcampaign schedule in which he was on the stump nearly every day. Hehas refused to concede the nomination to Dukakis despite thegovernor's apparently insurmountable delegate lead.   Bush, meanwhile, endorsed newly passed legislation that wouldexpand Medicare to help the elderly deal with the high cost ofserious illness. The Senate passed the bill 86-11 on Wednesday.   ``The legislation ... will, for the first time since thefounding of Medicare, extend benefits for our seniors,'' the vicepresident said in a statement issued by his Washington office.``Now they do not have to live in fear that their life's savingswould be wiped out by a prolonged hospitalization.''   In Michigan, a select group of Democratic delegates met withrepresentatives of the Dukakis and Jackson campaigns to find acommon ground for the party's platform.   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard, chairman of the DemocraticPlatform Committee, set up the meeting in hopes of writing an earlydraft that will help the party iron out its differences before thenational convention begins in Atlanta July 18.</TEXT></DOC>
