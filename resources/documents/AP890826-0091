An Israeli reserve officer whom news reports have linked to suchactivities said he had actually been teaching cattlemen how toprotect themselves from communist guerrillas.   Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking on Israelradio, said Israel had set up a special investigating committeewithout being requested to do so by either Colombia or the UnitedStates.   Colombia and the United States launched a major drive to break upthe drug-trafficking underworld in Colombia after drug bosses therehad a presidential candidate killed last week.   The Medellin drug cartel supplies most of the cocaine sold in theUnited States.   ``Two days ago, we asked the Colombian government at the requestof Foreign Minister (Moshe) Arens for any information available tothem, and we have offered them assistance with anything we can do,''Netanyahu said.   ``We need to find out if Israelis indeed are involved ... andwhat we can do to make sure that they are not,'' he added.   The Israeli government made the request after American newsreports that some Israelis were helping Colombian drug cartels trainassassination squads.   The Foreign Ministry official said Israel would take actionagainst anyone found to have violated Israeli laws.   He had said Friday that Israel may revoke passports of anyIsraeli mercenaries proven to be involved in training assassinationsquads.   Lt. Col. Yair Klein, identified as an Israeli trainer of suchsquads on the basis of videotape broadcast by the NBC News, returnedto Israel on Friday from Miami.   The 44-year-old Israeli is a retired commander of a paratroopanti-terror unit and president of a private security firm calledSpearhead.   ``I trained a group of farmers who defended themselves againstterrorist organizations, mostly the group called M-19, a guerrillagroup with the goal of turning Colombia into Cuba or Nicaragua,''Klein said on Israeli television Friday.   A senior Defense Ministry official said Klein is likely to bequestioned about his activities in Colombia. The television saidthat the ministry is considering filing a police complaint.   However, Israeli television and major dailies last weekidentified Klein as the leader of four Israeli army reserve colonelsreported to have worked with the Colombian drug traffickers.   Klein said Saturday on armed forces radio that his companytrained Colombian cattlemen and that the video in which he was shownwas made by Spearhead for advertising purposes.   He said the company completed its training a year ago and thathis last visit to Colombia was four months ago. Klein said thatvisit had nothing to do with the training program, but he did notsay exactly why he went.</TEXT></DOC>
