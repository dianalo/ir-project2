In Japan, it's the Pajero. Mazda markets the 626 here, thesame as the Capella back home. A BMW 750iL is a 750iL no matterwhere it's sold.   Putting a name on a car is a special mission, sometimes carryingspecial considerations for the U.S. market. What's in a name canlead to bewilderment and, as in at least two cases, lawsuits.   The United States is by far the largest car and light truckmarket in the world, a money pool foreign automakers cannot ignore.That includes Toyota, which sold more than 616,000 Japan-made carsin the United States last year and Sterling, which sold fewer than9,000 cars in 1988.   The American car-buyer is different from others, especiallyEuropeans who own fewer cars and are more discriminating in whatthey want, said Bill Wilcox, a car marketing plans manager at FordMotor Co.   Europeans ``are much more able to deal with, we have found,alphanumeric designations for car names,'' he said. ``Whereas themajority of people drive here, but a very small percent know whatthey have in their car.''   John Maton, who sells BMW and Mercedes-Benz autos in Ann Arbor,said: ``There's confusion if they're new customers'' and don'tunderstand the significance of a car's name.   Of all imports, those two West German makers may have the mostsystematic approach to ``badging,'' their cars. The designationsindicate characteristics, size of the car and its engine.   For example, the top-of-the-line BMW 750iL is a 7-series (the``7'') car with a 5.0-liter (the ``50''), fuel-injected (the ``i'')engine on a long (the ``L'') wheelbase.   All automakers selling worldwide spend lots of time and moneyresearching names. It doesn't always spare them problems.   Toyota Motor Corp. is in federal court battling Mead Data CentralInc. over the use of the name Lexus for the auto company's new lineof luxury cars designed strictly for U.S. sale. Mead claims Lexuswaters down the name of its legal information retrieval service,Lexis.   Lexus spokesman Kurt Von Zumwalt said among the 600 or so namesToyota officials in the United States and Japan started with was``Alexis.''   ``We took that and a few other names that were on the list and,in-house, formed a committee,'' he said. ``As a result of thatcommittee, the word Lexus was developed with the idea that itconnoted luxury and high technology, which were the two images thatwe wanted to create.''   The company conducted U.S. and international trademark searchesand found the similarity with Mead's Lexis. Toyota attorneys figuredthere would be no problem.   They were mistaken.   Last April 22, after negotiations, Mead Data sued Toyota infederal court in New York. A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 30. Untilthen, Toyota can continue limited use of the Lexus name. The twomodels were unveiled at the North American International Auto Showhere last week.   Von Zumwalt said Toyota has no regrets over its name choice.Besides, it has spent millions on development and promotion of theLexus name.   ``Hindsight is always perfect,'' he said. ``By the time Mead said`We are going to sue,' we were into it too far.''   General Motors Corp. also is in court over the name of one of itsChevrolets, the Beretta. The Italian weapons-maker Beretta claimstrademark infringement. That suit also is pending in New York.   The name of Mitsubishi's Pajero, a sport-utility vehicle made andsold in Japan, was changed to the Montero for U.S. distribution inpart because the word appeared vaguely Spanish. Some consumerstherefore may pronounce the ``j'' as an ``h,'' spokesman Shane Smithsaid.   He also said the Japanese name ``wasn't as an aggressive a nameas the competition, like (Nissan's) Pathfinder or (Ford's) Bronco.   ``Beyond that,'' he said, ``...Montero is easier to pronounce forAmericans.''   One of the names that's no trouble for Americans to pronounce isSterling, an upscale car made in the United Kingdom and distributedthrough Austin Rover Cars of North America.   The Sterling name, said marketing director Dave Huyett, ``gavetremendous connotations to what the car should be _ luxury, prestigeand high end.   ``It was a natural,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
