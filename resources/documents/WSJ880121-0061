It represents a voluntary, case-by-case, competitive mechanism for inducing the banks to transfer their write-offs into debt relief. This market-oriented approach is more practically appealing than a grand scheme such as an International Debt Discount Corp.    The plan's primary failing is that it focuses too much on the principal, while the high-spread interest rate on the Mexican bonds to be swapped for bank debt is to vary with market rates -- and interest payments are not guaranteed. Thus Mexico remains vulnerable to interest-rate risk, and the banks to interest-default risk. A percentage-point increase in market rates can wipe out all the interest savings expected from the scheme. Mexico's commitment to pay interest on these bonds can be met only by weakening its commitment to service bank loans. With a sharp rise in interest rates, Mexico and the banks may once again face the unpleasant choice between arranging &quot;new money&quot; or interrupting interest payments.    Another problem is that the swap forces banks to take an immediate hit on their capital base. Banks with a weak capital base may not wish to weaken it further at a time when the equity market is highly uninviting.    Finally, as has been widely noted, the plan in its current form cannot serve as a model for other large debtor countries because they do not have the reserves to pay for a U.S. guarantee on debt principal.    A better approach would be to fix the interest rate on the bonds at below-market rates, guarantee interest payments and not force the debtor to use scarce reserves to finance the guarantee. Here is how such a plan may work. For concreteness, suppose the debtor country is Brazil:   --Brazil announces a plan to swap its bank debt with as much as $40 billion of 20-year bonds with fixed below-market rates. The spread between the market rate and the coupon rate will determine how much debt relief is provided directly through interest concession, and how much through write-offs as loans are swapped for bonds. If the coupon rate is fixed at 4%, these bonds will sell at a 45% discount when the market rate is 9%. Even then, they will be worth more than Brazilian bank loans, now trading in the secondary market at around a 55% discount.    --A major creditor-country government guarantees principal as well as interest payments of these bonds. Here the guarantor assumes the default risk, whereas under the Morgan plan the U.S. government simply sells the principal guarantee for hard cash.    Japan could be such a guarantor. Now that the world's largest debtor country has shown the way by agreeing to sell its guarantee to Mexico at a market price, perhaps the world's largest creditor country can offer it for Brazil's commitment to policy adjustment under IMF and World Bank supervision.    One cheap way Japan can finance this guarantee is to set aside 10% of the bonds' face value as capital from its massive foreign-exchange reserves. It makes economic and political sense for Tokyo to put some of its increasingly useless stock of U.S. Treasury debt to work for the benefit of the debtor LDCs rather than simply let it sit idle and lose value with the depreciating dollar.    --The competitive bidding process of the Morgan plan is preserved. This allows the banks to decide the discount at which they are willing to swap their loans, and leaves the possibility open for some initial write-offs. Brazil chooses which of the bids it will accept. With full subscription and a 50% average discount, Brazil can lop off $2 billion in annual interest payments, a 20% saving.    This method is superior to the Morgan plan in three ways. First, it protects Brazil's interest savings from a sudden rise in market rates. Banks manage the interest-rate risk (it is their business to manage such risk) but face no interest-default risk. Brazil gets real debt relief, and the banks replace some of their bad loans with highly safe marketable securities that, unlike the proposed Mexican bonds, other investors should find very attractive.    Second, banks don't take any immediate capital loss unless they wish to. They can buy and sell these bonds over time in response to fluctuations in bond and equity markets, and choose between absorbing income and capital loss, minimizing the damage to their long-term profitability.    Third, the debtor country doesn't need scarce reserves to buy the guarantee. Commitment to policy reform is &quot;the price&quot; it pays instead.    Such a new approach should end the practice of forced lending for recycling interest payments. Instead, it should encourage a complete withdrawal of private banks from the business of providing balance-of-payments loans to foreign governments. As the bad loans are gradually banished from the balance sheet, banks should provide &quot;real new money&quot; in the form of project and trade finance while unforeseen future needs for balance-of-payments loans should be met by the IMF, and perhaps by the World Bank.    The Morgan proposal, while not finding a way to solve Mexico's debt problem, has cleared the way for work on a more realistic long-term solution to LDC debt woes.    ---   Mr. Islam is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. </TEXT></DOC>
