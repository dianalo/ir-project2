<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-32-0799 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method for optimizing image-recovery algorithms is presented that isbased on how well a specified visual task can be performed using thereconstructed images. Visual task performance is numerically assessedby a Monte Carlo simulation of the complete imaging process includingthe generation of scenes appropriate to the desired application, subsequentdata taking, image recovery, and performance of the stated task basedon the final image. This method is used to optimize the Algebraic ReconstructionTechnique (ART), which reconstructs images from their projections, byvarying the relaxation factor employed in the updating procedure. Insome of the imaging situations studied, it is found that the optimizationof constrained ART, in which a nonnegativity constraint is invoked, canvastly increase the detectability of objects. There is little improvementattained for unconstrained ART. 2 refs., 5 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
