Zapata said that if bondholders don't accept the tenderoffer, it will probably seek Chapter 11 bankruptcyprotection.</LP><TEXT>   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Zapata closed at $1.625 a share, down 25 cents.   Zapata said it expects to reach a final agreement &quot;withindays&quot; with a group of European investors for the sale of a90% interest in its 12-rig fleet for about $280 million.Zapata would retain the remaining 10% stake and receivemanagement fees for three years, as well as a share in anyprofits the operations might generate.   Proceeds would be used mainly to repay $53.6 million ofdebt on the rigs and to restructure the firm's senior bankdebt.   The company said that under an agreement in principlereached with its banks, the restructuring will cut its $560million of senior secured debt to $115 million. The bankswould get at least $160 million cash and 80% of Zapata'scommon stock. Lenders currently own 30% of the company.   Zapata also must pay off $15 million in revolving creditand pay fees related to the restructuring, as well as providefunds for taxes and future working capital needs.   Remaining funds will go toward a tender offer for $78million of subordinated debentures, on which $24 million inaccrued interest is owed. Zapata said if bondholders don'taccept the offer, &quot;it is likely that the company will beforced to file for protection under bankruptcy laws.&quot;   It said the cash offer will be made &quot;within the next fewmonths and will reflect the deeply distressed nature&quot; of thebonds. The company said the bonds have recently traded atbetween $350 and $480 for each $1,000 face value, includingaccrued and unpaid interest.   Zapata hasn't had an operating profit since the firstquarter of fiscal 1985. It had a loss of $20 million, or 63cents a share, in the latest third quarter ended June 30.   The new restructuring plan supersedes a 1987 plan thatassumed sufficient cash flow between then and the end of thisyear to pay down both principal and interest on its debt.&quot;The first one was {drawn up} under the assumption that thedepression in the offshore industry would come to a close andevidence that rig utilization would pick up,&quot; a spokesmansaid.   Despite recent developments that have pushed oil pricesabove $30 a barrel, Zapata said, &quot;fundamentals of the marketfor offshore drilling services remain unchanged.&quot; As aresult, &quot;We don't have the cash flow to service the principaland interest at the end of the year&quot; as called for under theprevious plan.</TEXT></DOC>
