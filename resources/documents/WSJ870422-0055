That is a dramatic turnaround from fiscal 1981 -- during which President Reagan took office vowing to curtail OSHA -- when the agency proposed such fines totaling only about $14,000.    Newly dominant congressional Democrats want OSHA, an agency of the Labor Department, to go even further. They are preparing to push for even more stringent scrutiny of job-safety in the nation's factories and its coal mines.    The renewed vigor at the agency is part of a regulatory revival on a broad range of issues where there is public pressure. Congress, for example, is forcing the administration to take tougher actions against toxic-waste disposal. And regulatory efforts are increasing in response to concerns over airline delays and air safety.    Half of those surveyed in a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll said there should be more government regulation of on-the-job health and safety, while only 6% said there should be less.    This attitude may partly reflect fears that as regulation of the workplace declined, so did worker safety. After dropping for four years, the number of workplace deaths, injuries and illnesses in 1984 rose almost 12% from 1983 to a rate that remained about the same in 1985, the latest year for which statistics are available.    &quot;There's a considerable amount of concern on the part of people who feel the workplace isn't safe,&quot; says Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, (D., Ohio), the new chairman of a key Senate labor subcomittee.    Congress already is off and running. Sen. Edward Kennedy, (D., Mass.) the new chairman of the Senate Labor Committee, is pushing for tougher regulatory enforcement at the nation's coal mines, where he says &quot;lives are lost every year because the regulations are weak.&quot; The number of deaths in the coal-mining industry rose to 87 in 1986 from 67 in 1985, according to government statistics.    Sen. Kennedy used his committee's first oversight hearing this year to air allegations that the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration was a weak enforcer and had watered down regulations on mine safety to suit industry.    The industry-backed American Mining Congress charged that the Senate hearings were &quot;driven by the heat of partisan politics.&quot; But the complaints about lax enforcement aren't limited to Democrats. Sen. Orrin Hatch, (R., Utah), the previous Labor Committee chairman, brands the mine administration &quot;an agency in trouble.&quot;    Congressional oversight hearings on OSHA also have been held, and more will come. Prospects are heightened, too, for controversial legislation sought by Democrats and labor unions requiring that past and current workers be advised of the risks of hazardous workplace substances such as asbestos.    Legislation introduced in the House and Senate would establish a national program to assess occupational health risks and notify workers who are at greatest risk. The legislation went nowhere last year, but with Democrats now in control of both houses, supporters are more optimistic; chances for passage also have been improved by a compromise between labor and some businesses.    Observers trace some of these shifting political and public currents to the poison-gas disaster at a Union Carbide Corp. plant in Bhopal, India in 1984 and a subsequent accident at one of Union Carbide's West Virginia plants. &quot;Bhopal reminded everyone that there are significant hazards that exist in plants that pose a risk to workers and communities,&quot; says Margaret Seminario, an AFL-CIO health and safety official. &quot;There is greater public support for government intervention to deal with these problems.&quot;    Under Labor Secretary William Brock, OSHA has begun to reverse some of the placid policies of the past. In the last year, the agency has accused a string of major companies of record-keeping violations. Its list of record proposed fines includes $1.4 million against Union Carbide and $910,000 against Chrysler Corp., plus $55,000 against Monsanto Co. The companies appealed the citations, and Chrysler has since agreed to pay $295,000 without admitting violations.    Though he defends OSHA's right to &quot;cite companies that have done the wrong thing,&quot; Thomas Evans, Monsanto's director of safety and environmental health, contends there has been &quot;a little bit of overkill&quot; in the agency's record-keeping enforcement. Mr. Evans asserts that one of the violations was for not recording that a 61-year-old employee was given oxygen when he became dizzy on a hot day and that another was for not recording a case of poison ivy.    OSHA defends its record-keeping initiative as critical to ensuring a safe workplace and says publicity has generated a &quot;deterrent effect.&quot; But congressional Democrats say much remains to be done in policing workplace hazards. Especially criticized is OSHA's practice of generally conducting full inspections only if a facility's accident rate exceeds the national average.    &quot;For six years there's been a failure to live up to obligations&quot; at the job-safety and mine-safety agencies, Sen. Metzenbaum contends. &quot;We intend to make it clear that we expect them to do that which the law requires of them.&quot;    Some question how hard Democrats will push on these issues, however. In Congress, &quot;there's a lot of smoke. It's less clear whether there'll be a lot of fire to accompany it,&quot; says F. M. Lunnie, director of labor relations for the National Association of Manufacturers.    At a time of increased attention to U.S. economic competitiveness, he says, &quot;there's going to be deliberate thought going into anything that can conceivably hamper the ability of business and the country to create jobs, maintain the standard of living, and let us compete in world markets.&quot; A recent report by the president's Council of Economic Advisers stressed that &quot;many of OSHA's standards increase costs and reduce productivity and competitiveness.&quot;    Nevertheless, the regulatory mood is swinging away from an emphasis on costs vs. benefits. &quot;You're running out of that ideological gas,&quot; contends Jeff Faux, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. &quot;It's like Oscar Wilde's character who knew the price of everything and the value of nothing -- people are beginning to see there are values other than short-term marketplace values.&quot;    ---                       OSHA Penalties    Penalties set by OSHA for record-keeping violations    FISCAL YEAR    1980                                     $   22,826    1981                                         14,166    1982                                         15,990    1983                                          9,561    1984                                         21,950    1985                                         23,061    1986                                      1,445,915    1987*                                     1,681,000    *To date Source: Occupational Safety and Health Administration</TEXT></DOC>
