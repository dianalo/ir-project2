The Secretary of Transportation approved the GreatLakes Pilotage Study Final Report, which contains recommendations to improvethe Great Lakes Pilotage System. Some of the recommendations call for amendmentsto the Great Lakes Pilotage Regulations. This proposal would implementthose recommendations by: (1) Requiring that an unqualified annual auditbe submitted by each authorized pilot organization, performed in accordancewith Generally Accepted Auditing Standards promulgated by the AmericanInstitute of Certified Public Accountants, (2) establishing general guidelinesand procedures for ratemaking, (3) requiring that the costs of all supportservices directly related to the provision of pilotage that pilots requirevessels to utilize be included in the rate base, (4) requiring each pilotagepool to certify whether any support service entity is related by beneficialownership to a pilot, (5) clarifying the regulations to indicate that financialpenalties can be applied to pilots as well as vessel operators who arein violation, (6) amending the steps that are to be followed when a pilotis not available within a reasonable period of time, and (7) amending therate schedule by adding a charge to compensate a registered pilot for ``deadheading'' across Lake Erie when aboard a vessel whose master uses a ``BCertificate'' in lieu of the pilot. These changes are proposed in orderto increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Great Lakes PilotageSystem.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received on or before May 22, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments should be submitted to: The Executive Secretary,Marine Safety Council (G-LRA-2/3600) (CGD 88-111) U.S. Coast Guard, Washington,DC 20593-0001.

Hartke,Project Manager, Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental Protection,and Commander Gerald A. Gallion, Project Attorney, Office of the ChiefCounsel.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of the Proposed Regulations</ITAG>Periodically, the U.S. Government has reviewed the operation of the GreatLakes pilotage system. The Department of Transportation completed a studyof Great Lakes Pilotage in December 1988. Since the last review in 1972,there has been a significant change in the amount of traffic using thesystem, the size of ships and the composition of their crews, and the typeof communication and safety equipment that ships carry. The purpose ofthis 1988 study was to reexamine the issues addressed in the 1972 studyof Great Lakes pilotage and to determine what modifications to the systemwould be necessary or desirable at this time.The study was conducted by a working group led by the Coast Guard and includedpersonnel from the Department of Transportation's Office of Policy andInternational Affairs, DOT General Counsel, the St. Lawrence Seaway DevelopmentCorporation, the Maritime Administration, and the State Department.A public meeting was held in Cleveland, Ohio, during June 1987 at the beginningof the review. Members of the team visited all three pilot organizationsand accompanied registered pilots on vessel transits. Other interestedparties were also visited, including the U.S. Great Lakes Shipping Association,the Shipping Federation of Canada, the International Association of GreatLakes Ports, several State Government representatives, and several statepilot associations. On March 14, 1988, the Department of Transportationreleased a draft report of the Great Lakes Pilotage Study for public comment.Seventy written comments were received. The final report of the study includesa number of recommendations, some of which require regulatory initiatives.The following recommendations are addressed in this proposal.Current regulations require independent audited financial statements fromeach authorized pilot pool. The current practice of two of the pilot organizationsis to obtain unqualified audit reports from independent certified publicaccountants. The other organization, by contrast, submits a compilationreport, consisting solely of financial information supplied by the pilotassociation management to an outside accountant for presentation to theCoast Guard. That type of reporting does not provide the same assurancesof accuracy of the financial statements as an unqualified audit. An independentaudit, performed in accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standardspromulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,should be required from all three pilot organizations. A review or compilationreport has a narrower scope than an audit, and the proposed regulationswould require an annual unqualified long form audit report from each pilotorganization by April 1 of the following year.The final report emphasizes the need for closer analysis of the reasonablenessof expenses included in the rate base. The Report recommends that the CoastGuard issue guidelines spelling out how allowable expenses will be determinedand that the expenses and criteria should be consistent for all three pilotagedistricts. It is therefore proposed, that a new Part 404 be added to theregulations which would provide general guidelines and procedures for GreatLakes pilotage ratemaking.To some degree in all three pilotage districts, support services, suchas pilot boats, are provided by entities that are directly or indirectlyrelated to the pilot pool or to pilot members of that pool. Although thesecosts are included in computing the pilotage rate base, the Coast Guarddoes not audit the accounts of these entities. Because of the owner relationship,these entities are in a position to charge higher prices for these servicesand therefore receive a higher return on investment to the individual pilotowners. The report recommends that the Coast Guard require each pilotagepool to certify whether any support service entity is related by beneficialownership to a pilot. If so, the Coast Guard should critically analyzeeach individual cost element that has been provided by such an entity.The Coast Guard should be assured that the goods or services were providedto the pool at prices no less favorable than could have been obtained froma non-related party bidding competitively. Therefore, it is proposed that the regulations be amended to require eachpilot organization to certify whether any support service entity is directlyor indirectly related by beneficial ownership to a pilot.Similarly, the costs of all support services that pilots require vesselsto utilize should be included in the rate base. For example, hand-heldradios are not part of the existing pilotage rate base, and the pilotshave routinely been charging for them as an additional item. At present,Coast Guard has no control over the rate charged for the use of hand-heldradios. Support services, such as the hand-held radios used by the pilots,should be brought into the rate base and not charged for separately outsidethe rate structure.Some users have expressed concern that the Coast Guard does not have anadequate range of sanctions to apply against pilots or pilot associationswho do not provide timely or adequate service. The principal penalty thathas been applied in the past against a pilot is suspension or revocationof his or her license. This involves a formal hearing process and is time-consumingand ineffective for all but the most serious offenses.There have been no recent cases where a license has been suspended. Inaddition, the study team found the Coast Guard has existing authority under46 U.S.C. 9308 to impose a $500 civil penalty on individual pilots or theirassociations for each violation of the regulations. Although it has notbeen used to date, the civil penalty is less extreme than suspension oflicense, increases flexibility, and is consistent with government practicesin other areas. Therefore, it is proposed to amend the regulations to statethat financial penalties can be applied to pilots as well as vessel operatorswho are in violation.The Final Report recommends that the regulations be amended to enable vesselmasters to contact the Coast Guard directly, rather than through the pilotagepool, whenever they encounter difficulty in obtaining a pilot in a timelymanner. Present regulations state that a vessel may be navigated in theU.S. waters of the Great Lakes without a United States or Canadian RegisteredPilot when the Director of the Great Lakes Pilotage Staff, with the concurrenceof the Commander, 9th Coast Guard District, notifies the master that aU.S. or Canadian Registered Pilot is not available.Notification to the master that a pilot is not available is made by theDirector through the appropriate pilotage pool, and shall not be deemedgiven until the notice is actually delivered to the vessel by the pilotagepool. As written, the regulations state that only the pilotage pool cannotify the Coast Guard of a problem, and that the failure or delay by thepool in processing a pilotage service request does not constitute constructivenotice that a pilot is not available. Therefore, it is proposed to amendthe regulations to provide for communications directly between the vesseland the Director.A ``B Certificate'' is a certificate, issued by Canada, which authorizesa foreign master to navigate his vessel in undesignated waters of the GreatLakes without a registered pilot. 46 U.S.C. 9302 requires a registeredpilot to direct the navigation of a vessel in waters of the Great Lakesdesignated by the President. Those waters are described in andSection; 401.300.Pilots on board vessels transiting Lake Erie operated by a master holdinga ``B Certificate'' are not compensated during the open water portion ofa voyage, unless their services are actually employed by the vessel. Sincethere is no pilot boat at Southeast Shoal, where undesignated waters becomedesignated waters, a registered pilot must ride (``dead head'') acrossthe undesignated waters of Lake Erie in order to direct the navigationof the vessel while it is in designated waters. Pilots should be compensatedfor their time in such cases, and the Final Report recommends that a pilotagefee comparable to the detention charges established in existing andSection;401.420 should be applied when a pilot is required to be aboard a ``B Certificate''vessel in undesignated waters, but is not employed by the vessel.Therefore, it is proposed to amend section 401.410(c) to institute a chargewhen a pilot is carried on board a vessel transiting Lake Erie operatedby a master holding a ``B Certificate''.<ITAG tagnum="84">Information Collection</ITAG>This proposed rule contains no new information collection requirements.The proposed requirement for unqualified audits is not an additional requirementbut rather a clarification of the present requirement. The existing regulationrequires audits by independent Certified Public Accountants.<ITAG tagnum="84">Evaluation</ITAG>These proposed regulations are considered to be non-major under ExecutiveOrder 12291, and non-significant under DOT regulatory policies and procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). The economic impact of this supplementalproposal has been found to be so minimal that further evaluation is unnecessary.Since the impact of this proposal is expected to be minimal, the CoastGuard certifies that it will not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities. There would be two identifiableadditional costs. One would be the additional charge for one pilot organizationto upgrade its financial reporting from a compilation report to an unqualifiedaudit report. The other additional cost would be the charge to be paidby the ship to compensate a registered pilot for ``dead heading'' acrossLake Erie when a vessel's master uses a ``B Certificate'' in lieu of thepilot. When a vessel's master utilizes his ``B Certificate'' in the undesignatedwaters of Lake Erie, the vessel does not incur the trans-lake pilotagecharge. However, because there is no pilot boat at Southeast Shoal to embarkand disembark the pilot, if the registered pilot must ``dead head'' acrossLake Erie aboard the vessel but is not employed by the vessel, the chargeto the vessel is calculated on a basic rate of $38 for each hour or partof an hour. It is estimated that approximately 20 vessels per year wouldbe affected by this charge, and the cost of this ``dead heading'' chargewould average approximately $540 per vessel. The remaining proposed amendmentsto the regulations are management actions on the part of the Coast Guardthat should improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Great LakesPilotage System.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism</ITAG>This rulemaking proposal has been analyzed in accordance with the principlesand criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determinedthat the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implicationsto warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 46 CFR Parts 401, 403, and 404</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Great Lakes, Navigation (water),Reporting requirements, Seamen.In consideration of the foregoing it is proposed that Chapter III of Title46 of the Code of Federal Regulations be amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 401_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
