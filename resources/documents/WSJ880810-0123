Yesterday, the Kuwaiti government said it has signed a deed, or a legally binding covenant, in which the Arab oil producer effectively promised that it won't launch a takeover for BP or seek a board seat. Kuwait said the deed &quot;is intended to make legally enforceable various assurances&quot; it already has given the British government. A Kuwaiti government lawyer here said the United Kingdom government could sue Kuwait in civil court if Kuwait violated the agreement.    With the pledge, Kuwait seeks to put its 21.68% stake in BP, Britain's largest company, in a favorable light. The British government is investigating the stake to see whether it raises &quot;public-interest&quot; concerns about the oil producer's influence on the company. It wasn't immediately clear whether the government will find the Kuwaiti deed persuasive. Analysts suggested British officials still may force Kuwait to lower its stake in BP.    Lord Young, Britain's trade and industry secretary, said late yesterday that he couldn't accept the deed and has returned it to Kuwaiti officials. A government spokesman said accepting the deed would &quot;fetter&quot; the minister's review of Kuwait's BP stake. The spokesman declined to comment on whether Lord Young would reconsider the deed after the U.K. Monopolies and Mergers Commission finishes a study of the holding, the first step in the government's investigation.    Michael Walter, the Kuwaiti government lawyer, called Lord Young's statement &quot;a technical step.&quot; He added that Kuwaiti officials hope Lord Young will consider their pledges and approve the BP holding once he receives the monopolies panel's report. &quot;If he decides other steps are more appropriate, we'll have to look at those,&quot; Mr. Walter said.    The British government launched its investigation of Kuwait's BP holding in May. Lord Young asked the monopolies commission to report on what, if anything, the government should do about the holding. Lord Young is expected to announce a decision sometime next month.    Kuwait said it signed the deed &quot;on its own initiative and without any request for such covenants&quot; from the British government. The Kuwaiti government also said it would adhere to the deed &quot;irrespective of the outcome&quot; of the monopolies commission investigation.    Investor reaction to Kuwait's announcement was muted, as markets await tomorrow's announcement of BP's first-half earnings. BP shares traded at 260 pence ($4.43) late yesterday on London's stock exchange, up three pence.    Kuwait said the deed promises it will use the BP stake &quot;only to protect&quot; its investment and not to advance other commercial or political goals. The Kuwaitis said they won't raise the BP stake above 21.68% and will limit their holding to 20% after selling any BP stock. Kuwait also pledged to restrict its voting power to 14.9% of BP's share capital and refrain from seeking a board seat or from opposing directors suggested by BP's board.    BP declined to comment yesterday on the covenant. But late last year, as Kuwait began amassing its BP stake, BP Finance Director David Simon said he was &quot;uncomfortable&quot; with any shareholding of more than 10%.    Analysts agreed that Kuwait's deed wouldn't necessarily prompt the U.K. government to wave through the oil producer's BP holding. &quot;It doesn't give them a clear run,&quot; said Jeremy Eldon, an analyst with London stockbrokers Phillips andamp; Drew. &quot;This is part of the lobbying.&quot;    Mr. Eldon suggested Kuwait's announcement might reflect its fears of an unfavorable report from the monopolies panel. He thinks the U.K. government still may force Kuwait to reduce its BP stake to 20%.    Michael Unsworth, an analyst at London stockbrokers Smith New Court, said Britain also might force Kuwait to reduce its voting power to 10% of BP's share capital, or even to pledge always to vote as BP directors wish.    Mr. Unsworth said, however, that yesterday's announcement also suggests Kuwait may be &quot;reading which way the wind is blowing&quot; and issuing promises sought by the monopolies commission. That would imply the government won't force Kuwait to sell a major chunk of its stake, the analyst added.    But BP could remain vulnerable even if the monopolies panel's report closely follows Kuwait's promises. Kuwait still could sell its large stake in the oil giant to a less-friendly investor.    The dispute over Kuwait's BP stake began late last year, when the Kuwaitis effectively bailed out the British government. To salvage its #7.24 billion ($12.35 billion) offer of BP stock after October's market crash, the government offered to buy back unwanted BP shares. Kuwait snapped up most of them, relieving the British government of both expense and embarrassment.    Political concern mounted about Kuwait's influence over the oil giant as its share buying continued until last March. BP has expressed worries that the Kuwaiti stake could harm its relations with the U.S. and other countries or end up in morehostile hands. </TEXT></DOC>
