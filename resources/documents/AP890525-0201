Leslie Lynn Doucette, 35, was charged with conspiring to stealtelephone and computer service, the U.S. attorney's office said.She was charged with trafficking in illegal credit cards andtelephone calling-card numbers on corporate and governmentvoice-mail computers.   Ms. Doucette, arrested Wednesday in Chicago, is from Toronto,and was convicted in Canada in 1987 of telecommunications fraud,said Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Cook.   Authorities believe her operation involved at least 50 people inseveral states, Cook said.   Federal agents have questioned pairs of teen-agers in Columbus,Ohio; Sterling Heights, Mich.; and Boston; and they impounded thecomputer equipment of a 15-year-old in Marietta, Ga., authoritiessaid. Search warrants also were issued in Los Angeles, Cook said.   U.S. Magistrate Joan Lefkow ordered Ms. Doucette, whose twochildren live with her, held without bond at least temporarily,Cook said.   Earlier in the four-month investigation, ``she called theattorney general's office in Arizona and indicated ... they weren'tgoing to be able to locate her,'' Cook said.   If convicted, Ms. Doucette faces up to 10 years in prison forillegal use of computer-access devices, 5 years for wire fraud and5 years for conspiracy, Cook said.   In Sterling Heights, Mich., Secret Service agents questioned twoeighth-graders said to have admitted belonging to the hackingnetwork. The 14-year-old boys ``got hooked because of theirfascination with the medium,'' said James Huse of the SecretService's Detroit office.   One of the boys ran up a $3,800 phone bill for April because hemistakenly thought he was making free long-distance calls, Husesaid.   Authorities estimated the value of goods and services obtainedillegally by the network to be between $200,000 and $1.5 million.Huse said investigators still had to sort through evidence to findout what the hackers ordered with other people's credit cards, andhow much revenue long-distance companies lost.   Court documents in Chicago charged that Ms. Doucette, using thecode-name ``Kyrie,'' infiltrated electronic ``mailboxes'' in whichbusinesses store and exchange information and messages.   The hackers communicated with each other through companies'private mailboxes to avoid the scrutiny police have been giving topublic ``bulletin boards,'' the forums where computer usersnormally share information, authorities said.   The hackers used their computers to program their telephones tokeep dialing until they got into an electronic mailbox, prosecutorssaid. There they found codes that gave them access to othercomputers or telephone services, credit card numbers and other data.   Ms. Doucette, for example, obtained at least $1,000 in moneyorders purchased from Western Union with credit cards whose numbersshe passed on to other hackers, Cook said.   Home Box Office and RCA Telephone System Sales also sufferedlosses, Huse said.</TEXT></DOC>
