The South African Law Commission said all attempts at race reformwere unlikely to succeed unless the government allows the country's28 million blacks to participate fully in national elections.   The commission's report was released one day after the mainAfrikaner church declared for the first time that apartheid is asin. The Dutch Reformed Church, which includes President P.W. Bothaand virtually his entire Cabinet as congregants, also expressedguilt for its role in supporting apartheid.   The commission report was the first time a government body calledfor black voting rights, although individuals in government havemade similar statements on occasion.   The commission was appointed by Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee in1986 and includes officials in the Justice Department as well assome of the country's senior judges and legal scholars.   The government had no immediate comment on the report.   South Africa should draw up a new constitution that guaranteesindividual rights but expressly prohibits race-based ``grouprights,'' the report said.   A bill of rights should ban all forms of discrimination, includethe right to appear in court after being arrested, and guarantee therights to peaceful protest and participation in politicalorganizations, the commission said.   Under South Africa's apartheid policies of racial segregation,the country's 5 million whites maintain economic and politicalcontrol over the 28 million blacks.   Also, the government's 33-month-old state of emergency allowsauthorities to detain people indefinitely without charge. Most formsof peaceful protest are banned or restricted under the emergencyregulations.   Botha has said repeatedly he will not even discuss thepossibility of a black majority government. He also has said he iscommitted to segregated schools and neighborhoods.   Botha is recovering from a stroke suffered Jan. 18. His heirapparent, Education Minister F.W. de Klerk, has been depicted asmore flexible, but he appears to agree with Botha on most majorpolicy issues and his given no indication he would introduce radicalchange.   However, the law commission report repeatedly stressed theimportance of universal franchise to break the political deadlock.   ``A bill of rights will not be accepted as legitimate if theblack people in South Africa are not given the vote,'' thecommission said. ``The right to vote is one of the fundamental humanrights that must be enshrined in any constitution.''   The commission said before a new constitution is drawn up thepresent statute book should be purged of discriminatory legislation.   The report cited several legal obstacles to reform:   _The country's 1983 constitution, which includes separate housesof Parliament for whites, people of mixed race and people of Asiandescent but not for blacks.   _The Population Registration Act, which requires all people to beclassified by race.   _The Group Areas Act, which segregates neighborhoods by race.   _Security legislation that allows for detention without trial.</TEXT></DOC>
