Outlining President Bush's $1 billion crime-fighting package,Thornburgh said he would seek congressional approval for anInternational Affairs Office. He said the State Department hasendorsed the idea.   A spokesman for the attorney general's office said existingmoney could be redirected to fund the unit.   Thornburgh's proposal to have an office that reports directly tohim to coordinate Justice Department international law enforcementefforts comes at a time in which the federal battle against drugsis under great scrutiny.   The president's drug policy coordinator, William Bennett, ispreparing a congressionally mandated battle plan. As part of theeffort U.S. attorneys around the nation recently issued a reportthat placed heavy blame on international drug trafficking for the30 percent increase in violent crime in the United States in thepast decade.   Although violent crime is mainly the responsibility of state andlocal authorities, ``the federal law enforcement cannot look theother way while violence, often drug-related, ravages many of ourinner-city communities and subjects innocent citizens to thecross-fire of turf wars between urban terrorist gangs,'' Thornburghsaid.   Bush's crime package focused on increasing the penalties for thecriminal use of guns, ending plea bargaining in such cases, hiringmore investigators and prosecutors and doubling the space infederal prisons, Thornburgh said.   ``Such a comprehensive approach, if replicated at the state andlocal level, can go a long way toward restoring much-neededcredibility to the deterrent capacity of our criminal justicesystem,'' he said.   Regarding drug use and trafficking in the United States,Thornburgh said the only way to win the ``war on drugs'' was to``re-establish the values that make a drug-dependent lifestyle aninadmissible option in this great nation.''   He praised the military's mandatory drug testing program, sayingit reduced the incidence of drug use from 27 percent in 1980 to 4.8percent last year. Thornburgh urged more drug testing of Americanworkers.   Speaking to reporters after the speech, Thornburgh said the U.S.Supreme Court's validation of drug-testing meant private andpublic-sector employers could begin ``reasonable'' drug-testingprogams.   ``I think private employers should examine the appropriatenessof it in the workplace,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
