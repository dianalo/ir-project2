The country's two main opposition parties claimed the governmenthad limited the scope of a probe into alleged corruption by Chun'syounger brother, charging information about the Chun family'sactivities was being suppressed.   ``The government has orchestrated another cover-up and fooledthe people,'' the Reunification Democratic Party charged.   The Party for Peace and Democracy demanded President Chun bequestioned about allegations of widespread corruption under hisgovernment and called for a full investigation.   The governing Democratic Justice Party denied there was anyattempt to cover up corruption and said it was determined to exposeany official wrongdoing.   The former president's brother, Chun Kyung-hwan, was chargedearly today with embezzling $10.4 million as head of Saemaul Undong(New Community), a semi-official development program.   The younger Chun, who was taken to a Seoul prison in handcuffs,also was charged with taking bribes, influence peddling, evadingtaxes and violation of business, land and construction laws.   If convicted under special laws covering massive public fraud,Chun could receive a sentence ranging from 10 years in prison todeath.   Ten other people, including aides of the younger Chun and seniorSaemaul officials, also were indicted on embezzlement, bribery,influence peddling and corruption charges, officials said.   The other suspects include Chun Kyung-hwan's two brothers-in-law.   The opposition charged that the younger Chun and his associateshad embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars, and the governmentwas concealing evidence to prevent a political backlash.   Chief Prosecutor Kang Won-il said the younger Chun amassed afortune in money, land and stocks by using government and familyconnections during the seven years he headed Saemaul.   The former president had appointed him to the post.   ``It is agonizing to me that I have caused trouble to mybrother,'' the younger Chun was quoted as saying by prosecutors.   Kang said the younger Chun diverted government and Saemaulfunds, pressured corporations into making illegal donations,arranged to get private businesses government contracts andpermits, and misappropriated land and buildings built withgovernment funds.   Kang said the investigation was centering on charges Chundiverted huge sums of money overseas for land speculation in theUnited States and Australia. The prosecutor said the probe wascontinuing and further revelations were expected.   Saemaul was founded in 1971 to promote urban and ruraldevelopment. The younger Chun resigned as its chief in 1987 afterbeing linked to gangsters.   Prosecutors are questioning government officials about chargesthey aided or concealed Saemaul corruption to protect the formerpresident and his family.   Former President Chun, who left office Feb. 25 after seven yearsin power, has not been implicated in the Saemaul affair. He is on aprivate American tour and met last week with President Reagan.</TEXT></DOC>
