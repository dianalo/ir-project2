In letters sent out yesterday, the FDA notified Procter andamp;Gamble Co., CPC International Inc. and Great Foods of AmericaInc. that the no-cholesterol boasts and depiction of a hearton their product labels are deceptive. While the productsdon't contain cholesterol, the FDA said, the labels leave themisimpression these products by themselves benefit the heartand overall health.</LP><TEXT>   The letters threaten the companies with further action ifthe products aren't relabeled. The notices specifically citePandamp;G's Crisco corn oil, Mazola corn oil made by CPC's BestFoods division and Great Foods' HeartBeat canola oil.   The companies denied any intent to mislead but said theywould cooperate with the agency. One of them, Procter andamp;Gamble, said it would remove the no-cholesterol claim fromall of its food products until the FDA issues rules about howthe claim can be used. The other companies said theysupported the FDA's efforts to &quot;clarify&quot; food labelingpractices.   FDA Commissioner David Kessler said in an interview thatthe agency's action is designed to serve notice onmanufacturers of hundreds of supermarket items that deceptiveclaims regarding cholesterol won't be tolerated on productshigh in fat and saturated fat. In the interview, the FDAchief accused Pandamp;G, CPC's Best Foods division and Great Foodsof passing off &quot;half-truths&quot; on health-minded consumers.&quot;These labels don't tell the whole story,&quot; he said. &quot;Theseproducts are 100% fat, and a high fat diet is unhealthy.&quot;Excess fat increases the likelihood of cancer and otherchronic diseases as well as obesity, he added.   For the suddenly aggressive FDA, it was the second majorcrackdown on product labels in less than three weeks. It wasalso the second time that consumer-products giant Pandamp;G hasbeen singled out for enforcement action. The agency stunnedthe industry April 24 by having U.S. marshals seize a Pandamp;Gshipment of Citrus Hill Fresh Choice orange juice because ofmisleading freshness claims.   The regulatory object lesson wasn't lost on the industry.In rapid succession, five other manufacturers of brand-nameorange juice and pasta sauce agreed to stop touting theirproducts as fresh when they were in fact processed.   &quot;We are systematically examining every food category tomake sure no food company gets an unfair advantage by makingmisleading claims,&quot; said Dr. Kessler.   Marketing experts say that the two most effectivemarketing pitches for foods are the word &quot;fresh&quot; and theclaim &quot;no cholesterol,&quot; he said. As a doctor and enforcer offederal food-labeling law, he regards the misuse of suchpitches as a threat to public health.   Within a few days, Dr. Kessler added, the agency intendsto challenge no-cholesterol claims being made for other kindsof high-fat products. One of the likeliest targets:margarine.   In a so-called regulatory letter yesterday, FDA officialRobert Lake said it is misleading for CPC's Best Foods towrap the statement &quot;No Cholesterol&quot; around a heart on itsMazola corn oil. Mr. Lake informed Pandamp;G that its Crisco cornoil was similarly &quot;misbranded.&quot;   While no-cholesterol products benefit the heart, Mr. Lakewrote, the labels fail to tell consumers that &quot;other dietaryfactors and overall weight control are {also} necessary toachieve a healthy heart.&quot;   Great Foods, based in Cresskill, N.J., was challenged onits choice of a brand name -- HeartBeat -- for its canola oilas well as the use of an electrocardiograph and a heart andthe statement &quot;Dedicated to Heart Health&quot; on the label.   All three companies were warned that, aside from thehigh-fat content of corn and canola oil, it is misleading tomake no-cholesterol claims on another count. Such boastsimply that their products differ from similar vegetable oilswhen in fact all are free of cholesterol, Mr. Lake said.   In Cincinnati, Pandamp;G's chairman, Edwin L. Artzt, said, &quot;Wethink our consumers want to know which products do notcontain cholesterol, and that's why we have carried the `nocholesterol' claim on our labels.&quot; But he added, &quot;We arequite willing to help defuse this food labeling issue byremoving these claims from our packages.&quot;   CPC International, based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., deniedthat its Mazola labeling is misleading. &quot;In fact, it isintended to correct a common misconception that all fats andoils contain cholesterol,&quot; the company said. &quot;We supportFDA's initiatives to clarify labeling issues and will workwith them to resolve this matter.&quot;   Robert Harris, president of Great Foods, expressedconfidence that &quot;a mutually agreeable solution&quot; can bereached with the FDA. He added that he supported the agency'seffort. &quot;We think what they're doing to clarify food labelingis terrific,&quot; he said.   Yesterday's action, coming so soon after the crackdown ondeceptive freshness claims, was welcomed by consumeradvocates. &quot;This certainly demonstrates the FDA does in facthave teeth -- and will bite,&quot; said Ellen Haas, executivedirector for Public Voice for Food and Health Policy. &quot;Buttwo actions doesn't a policy make {after} two decades ofinaction.&quot;   Bruce Silverglade, attorney for the Center for Science inthe Public Interest, commended Dr. Kessler for cracking downon misbranded products immediately rather than waiting untilMay 1993, the deadline for issuance of FDA rules under thenutrition-labeling law enacted last year. He and Ms. Haasexpressed hope that the FDA would soon challengeno-cholesterol labeling for potato chips, doughnuts and othersnack products that are high in fat.</TEXT></DOC>
