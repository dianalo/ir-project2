<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-78-1081 </DOCNO><TEXT>Sensitive radio-frequency (rf) amplifiers based on dc SuperconductingQUantum Interface Devices (SQUIDS) are available for frequencies up to200 MHz. At 4.2 K, the gain and noise temperature of a typical tunedamplifier are 18.6 {plus_minus} 0.5 dB and 1.7 {plus_minus} 0.5 K at93 MHz. These amplifiers are being applied to a series of novel experimentson nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and nuclear quadrupole resonance(NQR). The high sensitivity of these amplifiers was demonstrated in theobservation of ``nuclear spin noise'', the emission of photons by {sup35}Cl nuclei in a state of zero polarization. In the more conventionalexperiments in which one applies a large rf pulse to the spins, a Q-spoiler,consisting of a series array of Josephson junctions, is used to reducethe Q of the input circuit to a very low value during the pulse. TheQ-spoiler enables the circuit to recover quickly after the pulse, andhas been used in an NQR experiment to achieve a sensitivity of about2 {times} 10{sup 16} nuclear Bohr magnetons in a single free precessionsignal with a bandwidth of 10 kHz. In a third experiment, a sample containing{sup 35}Cl nuclei was placed in a capacitor and the signal detected electricallyusing a tuned SQUID amplifier and Q-spoiler. In this way, the electricalpolarization induced by the precessing Cl nuclear quadrupole momentswas detected: this is the inverse of the Stark effect in NQR. Two experimentsinvolving NMR have been carried out. In the first, the 30 MHz resonancein {sup 119}Sn nuclei is detected with a tuned amplifier and Q-spoiler,and a single pulse resolution of 10{sup 18} nuclear Bohr magnetons ina bandwidth of 25 kHz has been achieved. For the second, a low frequencyNMR system has been developed that uses an untuned input circuit coupledto the SQUID. The resonance in {sup 195}Pt nuclei has been observed at55 kHz in a field of 60 gauss. 23 refs., 11 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
