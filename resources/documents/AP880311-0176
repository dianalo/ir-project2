McFarlane, standing before U.S. District Judge Aubrey E.Robinson Jr., admitted that he withheld information about theactivities of Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and other members of theNational Security Council staff in three 1985 letters to Housecommittees.   He also admitted withholding information from the House ForeignAffairs Committee when he told the panel on Dec. 8, 1986, that hewas unaware of any efforts to solicit donations for the Contrasfrom a third country.   Each of the four charges carries a maximum penalty of one yearin prison and a $1,000 fine.   After entering his plea, McFarlane told reporters that he didwithhold information from Congress on the occasions cited in thecharges, but added:   ``My actions were motivated by what I believed to be in theforeign policy interest of the United States.''   McFarlane said that since the Iran-Contra affair became publicin late 1986, he had spent more than 200 hours testifying privatelyand publicly without immunity from prosecution. He promised tocontinue cooperating ``until this matter is finally resolved.''   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said he could have soughtmore serious perjury charges against McFarlane, but settled for themisdemeanor charges because the former White House aide had shownremorse and had tried to correct his original testimony.   President Reagan, boarding a helicopter for a weekend at CampDavid, Md., refused to comment when asked about McFarlane. ``It'sin the court,'' Reagan shouted to reporters.   Each charge carries a minimum sentence of one month in prison,but Robinson reminded McFarlane he could receive a maximumfour-year sentence.   ``You understand that imprisonment could be consecutive?'' thejudge asked.   ``I understand that,'' said McFarlane, who spoke in a very soft,subdued voice.   Q. ``This is the action you knowingly took with respect towriting the letters?''   A. ``It is, your honor.''   Referring to testimony McFarlane gave the House Foreign AffairsCommittee, the judge asked, ``That was a knowing response?''   ``It was, your honor,'' McFarlane replied.   Robinson filed under seal a letter of cooperation that McFarlaneand his attorney, Leonard Garment, had signed as part of pleabargain struck with Walsh, who is investigating the Iran-Contraaffair.   Robinson did not set a date for sentencing, indicating that hewill assess McFarlane's degree of cooperation with the prosecutorbefore making a decision.   McFarlane was released on his personal recognizance.   The charges of withholding information from Congress weredetailed in a criminal information, which is filed when a defendanths agreed to enter a guilty plea to charges.   Secretary of State George Shultz, asked at the White House aboutMcFarlane's guilty plea, told reporters that ``if he has made somemistakes, I don't know about that. ... Bud McFarlane continues tohave my strong friendship.''   The document filed today alleges that McFarlane made falsestatements in letters sent in 1985 to the House Intelligence andForeign Affairs committees and a Foreign Affairs subcommittee.   The charges involve assurances to Congress that members ofMcFarlane's National Security Council staff, specifically Lt. Col.Oliver L. North, were not involved in private efforts to help theContras.   In an Oct. 7, 1985, letter to the House Intelligence Committee,McFarlane wrote that ``Lieutenant Colonel North did not use hisinfluence to facilitate the movement of supplies to theresistance,'' the information said.   In addition, it said, McFarlane assured the committee there was``no official or unofficial relationship with any member of the NSCstaff regarding fund raising for the Nicaraguan democraticopposition.''   Another charge states that on Sept. 5, 1985, McFarlane withheldinformation from the House Intelligence Committee when he wrote:``I can state with deep personal conviction that at no time did Ior any member of the National Security Council violate the letterof spirit'' of the Boland Amendment, which banned U.S. military aidto the Contras.   The Sept. 5 letter also stated that ``we did not solicit fundsor other support for military or paramilitary activities eitherfrom Americans or third parties.''   The charge notes that the letter ``unlawfully withheld materialinformation'' from the panel because McFarlane ``then and thereknew and believed that a member of the NSC staff had violated theletter or spirit of the Boland Amendment by, among other things,soliciting support for military and paramilitary activities of theContras and offering certain advice for the conduct of the Contra'smilitary activities and organization.''   The letter was written in response to an Aug. 20, 1985, letterfrom the panel's chairman, Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., requestinginformation about news reports that the NSC staff was helping theContras.   Another charge relates to Dec. 8, 1986, testimony in whichMcFarlane told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that he was notaware of any third country or citizens of a foreign nation helpingthe Contras.   ``The concrete character of that is beyond my ken,'' McFarlanetold the committee.   The court documents said McFarlane was withholding his knowledgethat ``since 1984 the nationals of the third country referred tohad expressed willingness to contribute millions of dollars to theContras,'' and that McFarlane gave a ``representative of that thirdcountry with the number of a Contra-controlled bank account intowhich the funds could be deposited.''   The plea bargain was negotiated by McFarlane's attorney, LeonardGarment, and Walsh, who is expected to seek a round of indictmentsin coming weeks from a federal grand jury that has beeninvestigating the arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits tothe Contras.   McFarlane has testified extensively before the grand juryimpaneled by Walsh. Last year, McFarlane tried to kill himself withan overdose of the tranquilizer Valium the day before his scheduledtestimony before a presidential commission that investigated theIran-Contra affair.   Two other Iran-Contra figures have entered guilty pleas inWalsh's investigation and are cooperating with the independentcounsel.   Two conservative fund-raisers, Carl R. ``Spitz'' Channell andRichard Miller admitted last year that they participated with Northin an illegal scheme to use a tax-exempt foundation to raise moneyfor the Contras.   McFarlane, who resigned as White House national security adviseron Dec. 4, 1985, traveled with North to Tehran in May 1986 aboard aplane that delivered spare parts for Hawk missiles that hadpreviously been shipped to Iran by the Israelis.   McFarlane carried a cake and a Bible to give to the Iraniansduring negotiations over the release of American hostages beingheld in Lebanon.   During testimony before congressional investigators last summer,McFarlane said he ordered his NSC staff not to solicit privatefunds for the Contras.   North, however, testified that ``I never heard thoseinstructions.'' He said McFarlane had asked him to help keep Contraforces operating after Congress imposed a ban on direct U.S.military aid.   McFarlane said he was not aware that arms sale proceeds werebeing diverted to the Contras until North told him about it duringtheir return trip from Iran.   North testified that McFarlane told him to include falseinformation in a chronology of the arms deal which was prepared inthe fall of 1986, while the Iran-Contra affair was uraveling.   McFarlane denied he knowingly falsified the chronology, and saidincorrect information was given to him during a meeting led byNorth.</TEXT></DOC>
