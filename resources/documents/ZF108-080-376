 But as other companies' dependence on computers has grown, so hastheir need to connect computers together in local, metropolitan, andwide-area networks.andM;LANs are used to connect computers together inside a building or within alimited, campus-type area.andP;  Metropolitan-Area Networks (MANs) extend LANcapabilities up to a 50 kilometer radius, while minimizing construction andmaintenance costs for users.andP;  The first MAN experiments are now beingsponsored by Nynex and US West in cooperation with Bell CommunicationsResearch, the research arm jointly owned by the seven Bell holding companies.andM;Wide-Area Networks, (WANs) extend LAN and MAN-like capabilities regionally,nationally, or internationally.andP;  The WAN operated by Dun andamp; Bradstreet, knownfor its worldwide business information services, connects Dandamp;B offices in 15countries.andP;  The network &quot;improves our ability to compete for more business,&quot;says Joe Wakin, vice president of operations and international services atDunsNet, a subsidiary formed by Dandamp;B to operate the worldwide WAN.andM;DunsNet has grown quickly.andP;  In 1985, Dandamp;B had only one node in London and onein Paris, connected by leased lines to its main U.S.andP;  data center inBridgewater, N.J.andP;  Today DunsNet connects 40 data centers worldwide.andP;  Butwith the advent of ISDN right around the corner, Dandamp;B is planning to upgradeits current network, which is based on 19.2K- and 56K-bits-per-second leasedlines, to 1.544M-bits-per-second T-1 lines.andP;  The key to its plans is addedflexibility in upgrading from the T-1 network to the ISDN.andP;  &quot;We're moving tohigh-speed digital technology, so we will be prepared for ISDN when itbecomes available,&quot; says Rashid Karachiwala, director of network developmentfor DunsNet.andM;Whither WANs?andM;WANs are used primarily to transport information and data between points in acorporate network.andP;  Traditionally, WANs have been based on leased networks ofanalog lines, with modems at each site.andP;  Today, companies are moving towarddigital transmission technology and with it, integrating voice information onthe same lines as those used for the corporate data network.andP;  This results innot only reduced operation costs for a corporation but also greater cohesionsince the corporation controls its own telecommunications.andM;Before network managers can avail themselves of WAN technology, however, theymust first address why a WAN will be valuable and what the network will beused for once installed.andP;  Here are a few issues to clarify in this area.andM;Data Types.andP;  Before considering a T-1 network, statistics must be compiledconcerning the quantity, nature, and timing of information that moves betweenthe branch offices in a company.andP;  What percent of traffic is voice?andP;  Data?andO;Image data such as facsimile?andP;  Video?andP;  At what time of day do peaks intransmission occur?andP;  Answer to these questions will help the manager designthe T-1 network.andM;Applications.andP;  Beyond the kind of data being sent, it is necessary to knowthe purpose of each information exchange.andP;  Is most of the data traffic forhost access from remote terminals or for peer-to-peer, interprocess, orcommunications between data centers?andP;  Is the data synchronous orasynchronous?andP;  What protocols are used?andP;  ARe the applicationstiming-sensitive, such as Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Manufacturing(CAD/CAM) applications?andP;  When a PBX interface is required, is that PBX analogor digital?andP;  How many voice circuits will be required between two proposedlocations?andM;Equipment.andP;  To make WANs ISDN-compatible, it is necessary to start withdigital technology: T-1 lines and multiplexers that can handle both voice anddata.andP;  The MainStreet 3600 Bandwidth Manager from Newbridge CommunicationsNetworks has been designed from the ground up, using both voice networkingand data networking principles in anticipation of ISDN and other digitalcommunications facilities.andP;  Other multiplexers from Digital CommunicationsAssociates and Network Equipment Technologies also provide ISDN growth paths.andM;Channels.andP;  WANs may be built using public network facilities, privatelyconstructed facilities, or with a hybrid of the two.andP;  Public network-basedsolutions offer nearly unlimited flexibility in terms of a WAN configuration.andO;Telephone companies will gladly supply leased circuits between any two pointsin the country or the globe.andP;  And with the &quot;virtual network&quot; services offeredby interexchange carriers, and soon to be introduced by local phonecompanies, network managers can reconfigure entire networks.andM;Of course, the public network approach has disadvantages.andP;  While telephonecompanies will gladly build circuits for their customers, it can take as longas six months before the circuits are installed.andP;  when corporate networks arenearing the top of management's &quot;strategic priorities&quot; list, six months canbe too long to wait.andM;Enter the private network providers--system integrators, transmissionequipment makers, network contracting firms, who provide the equipment,facilities, and expertise to build a WAN for any company.andP;  With a completelyprivate network, managers have more control over the network's operatingcharacteristics, configuration, and properties.andP;  Network management is acinch with private networks.andP;  Yet, building a private network can beexpensive, and doesn't have the same flexibility as a public networksolution.andM;Some companies, in the attempt to get the best of both worlds, build &quot;hybrid&quot;networks using some public and some private facilities.andP;  This cost-effectiveway to build a network requires an extremely powerful network managementsystem to integrate public and private facilities.andM;Regardless of the source of communications channels, ISDN-compatible WANswill be built around the 1.5M-bits-per-second digital circuits, known as T-1.andO;Since their commercial introduction early this decade, T-1 circuits haveenjoyed faster growth than any other telephone company network service.andO;Several reasons explain T-1's popularity.andP;  Traditionally, T-1 economics areoutstanding, permitting the lease of a 24-channel T-1 circuit--with eachchannel running at 64K bits per second--as a replacement for as few as sixanalog voice lines.andP;  With private systems, where users construct their ownT-1 networks using technologies such as digital microwaves or fiber optics,the break-even point can be even lower.andM;What's more, the growth of information systems has made it strategicallyimportant for companies to maintain effective data communications networksfor the transport of information.andP;  As information has become more of astrategic resource, the corporate data network is more and more a focal pointfor competitive advantage.andP;  Corporations that construct their own networksbased on T-1 economies get both the economy of T-1 transmission and thecontrol of operating their own network.andM;As an added advantage, digital communications support different informationforms such as data, voice, image traffic, and even video.andP;  All digitalinformation is carried the same way, with the same economy.andP;  If T-1 hadn'tenough advantages already, its ability to combine voice and data has clinchedit a spot at the top of every telecom manager's list.andM;What's more, T-1 lines, representing 24 64KB channels, have the same bit rateas the ISDN primary rate of 1.544M bits per second.andP;  In ISDN, these channelswill be divided into 23 bearer channels and one signaling channel, or 23B+D.andO;Basing a WAN on T-1 circuits not only makes good economic sense, but it alsogives a secure upgrade path to the ISDN.andM;Enter ISDNandM;With ISDN services due for installation in the next 18 months, it's importantto verify that the hardware used to construct a WAN will be compatible withISDN signaling formats.andP;  It must be able to send and receive signaling dataalong the 64KB &quot;D&quot; channel on a 23+D primary rate ISDN circuit, as well astransmit and receive data according to the digital, 64KB format used in ISDN.andO;Verifying whether a piece of equipment is compatible with the ISDN formatscan be difficult, however, as the technical specifications for ISDN are stillunder discussion by the International Consultative Committee on Telephone andTelegraph (CCITT).andM;Until the final veil is lifted on the ISDN, the safest route to take inbuilding WANs is to use the X.25 packet-switched data standard, which isalready a global networking standard.andP;  The X.25 specification will be writteninto the final ISDN format, ensuring an upward growth path from current X.25data networks to future ISDN networks.andP;  ISDN also promises public-networkavailability for such network features as mnemonic addressing (where usersaccess remote resources by a name, instead of by a 14-digit network address).andM;Mnemonic addressing is impossible on today's public data networks, but withthe intelligent signaling in ISDN networks, provided by the CCITT's SignalingSystem #7, such features will become commonplace in public networks.andO;Signaling System #7 is the basis for what is known as the Intelligent Network(IN).andM;The IN is a new architecture for the telephone network.andP;  Certain trends intelecommunications make the IN inevitable:andM;* New technology favors distributed processing over the hierarchical schemes.andO;The IN takes advantage of digital communications technology.andM;* Telephone company regulators demand an open network architecture, but mosthave no idea how to achieve it.andP;  The IN provides concrete technicalspecifications to help make an open network a reality.andM;* Telephone companies want to provide new telecommunications services withoutwaiting for manufacturers to develop the required network hardware andsoftware.andP;  The IN makes it possible to design services independently of anyequipment manufacturer.andM;In its flexibility and modularity, the IN represents a completely new way toprovide enhanced communications services.andP;  With the IN, telephone companiescan easily develop their own network services, and--regulationnotwithstanding--realize a greater and faster profit from the value they addto their networks.andP;  Because of this economy, the number of customers requiredto make a new service worthwhile is smaller; phone companies can developservices for smaller customer groups and still make a profit.andM;What's more, telephone company customers will eventually be able to developtheir own IN applications directly.andP;  This means telephone services will beopen to what is known in computer circles as &quot;third-party&quot; softwaredevelopment (in a third-party environment, software applications are suppliednot by the network vendor or the customer, but by a third party).andP;  Such anenvironment is unprecedented as far as the public telecommunications networkis concerned.andM;In sum, the IN brings telecommunications service deelopment out of the handsof central-office switch makers and into the hands of the telephonecompanies, other telecom service providers, or even the telecom servicecustomers.andM;Immediate IN ApplicationsandM;Many IN concepts can be put to use in WAN design well before the officialspecification is in place.andP;  Unlike existing leased-line services provided byphone companies, the ISDN-based &quot;23B+D&quot; T-1 circuits will not be dedicatedconnections from one point to another.andM;The new network capability that will probably do the most in the short termfor productivity is the functional integration of communications andcomputing resources, usually called Computer Integrated Telephony (CIT).andO;Digital Equipment offers a call management system running on a VAX computerwhich controls a Mitel SX-200 private branch exchange.andP;  The system integratedautomatic dial-by-name offers telephone directory administration withelectronic mail and local area networking.andM;For example, a VAX user, in the middle of word processing a document, canbring up the call-management screen with the touch of a function key.andP;  TheCIT screen then offers a variety of functions.andM;The user may find a telephone number of any other user in the CIT system,then dial the number from the screen.andP;  In this example, the terminal in theDEC stand was dialing the phone that shared its desk by instructing the PBXto do so through a proprietary VAX-to-PBX connection.andP;  As the callprogressed, messages appeared on the screen of terminal: &quot;Ringing,&quot; &quot;Calledparty has answered,&quot; and so forth.andM;The real value of ISDN-based private networking is that ISDN has been moreclearly thought out than many preceeding communications systems.andP;  As aresult, the standards that define it are more technology-resistant.andP;  Futuredevelopments in computing and networking capabilities will not cause thehavoc in corporate network planning which characterized the arrival of PCs orLANs.andM;Building For TomorrowandM;There are still many opportunities for havoc in WAN implementation, butsensible planning can help avoid many pitfalls.andP;  The following can help youmake a smooth transition from your current system to ISDN.andM;* If you have multiplexers already in place, check: Are they analog ordigital?andP;  Are they data transparent, that is, will they work with any kind ofinformation stream?andP;  Are they indifferent to being applied to voice or data?andM;* Is your PBX ISDN-ready?andP;  Very few are.andP;  It is not enough to have a digitalPBX, although many manufacturers will eventually announce on-site software orupgrades to existing digital PBXs to make them ISDN-compatible.andM;* Is your organization ready for global connectivity?andP;  What is your company'suser-to-terminal or user-to-workstation ratio?andP;  If it is lower than one infive, chances are you will have to bring employees up to speed on the purposeand value of this technology.andM;* Use equipment with open architecture whenever possible.andP;  Microcomputersmust have expansion slots.andP;  PBXs must have upgradable programming, typicallystored in ROM chips, and replaceable line cards.andP;  This will allow you toadapt to swiftly changing technology.andM;The costs of constructing a custom network can be high, and its value to acorporation hard to assess.andP;  Yet the value of WANs may best be measured &quot;notin dollars and cents but in terms of winning and losing businessopportunities,&quot; says John Holmblad, vice president of network systems forTelenet.andP;  Once a network is in place, it can be modified and improved, oftenopening up new product development possibilities.andM;Bruce Paige is president of Magnetic Press, a New York-based research andconsulting firm specializing in information and communications technologies.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
