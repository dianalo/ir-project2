 The patient'sinformation is then processed into the trauma centre's database, alerting herphysician.andP;  The physician has immediate access to all the information fromhis home computer.andM;It sounds like a scene from a futuristic movie.andM;But healthcare providers are hoping it won't be long until they are fullyable to take advantage of computer technology in order to save lives.andM;&quot;It's increasingly obvious that the medical profession and the public seekcontinuing medical education and information management as the most importantimprovement that can come to the practice of medicine in the next years,&quot;says Dr. Rick Swanson, a member of the department of family medicine and thedepartment of continuing medical education, faculty of medicine at theUniversity of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon.andM;Swanson, who is the author of Family Practice Review: A Problem-orientedApproach, says the availability of accurate and up-to-date information toassist a physician in making diagnostic and management choices will benecessary for future family physicians.andM;&quot;I believe that we're in a time when physicians are going to be required tomake use of the best computer technology not only to run their practices butalso to keep abreast of the medical information which is available,&quot; he says.andM;Recently, a Montreal-based electronic publishing company in the healthcarefield launched a medcical information system that the company claims willallow doctors receive relevant medical information instantly throughcomputers.andM;Developed by Clinidata Inc. and endorsed by the College of Family Physiciansof Canada, the new information system consists of a series of drug anddisease databases, as well as an electronic patient record interfaced withther drug databases, and communications and on-line capabilities.andM;&quot;It's now time for computer technology to be used (in healthcare) not onlyfor administrative purposes but for clinical applications,&quot; says FredericPorte, president of Clinidata.andM;He adds that the system contains an important continuing medical educationcomponent to update physicians on new developments in the field of medicine.andM;According to Dr. Paul Rainsberry, director of education at the College ofFamily Physicians of Canada, the amount of literature available forphysicians to read is so vast that it is becoming impossible for them to keepup to date.andM;Swanson agrees and adds that patients know there is a rapid explosion ofmedical literature available and expect their doctors to come up with theanswers, &quot;but they don't necessarily expect them to know everything.andM;&quot;In 1990, doctors cannot be expected to know everything, but they can beexpected to know where to find it.&quot;andM;Rainsberry priased the Clinidata system for its continuing medical educationfeatures.andP;  One of those features is a telecommunications package that allowsaccess to continuing medical education databases on major diseases throughClinidata's central computer and access to the College of Family Physiciansof Canada's library through electronic mail.andM;Jean-Claude Martin, a special adviser for the Canadian Hospital Associationin Ottawa, agrees that close and constant cooperation between the technologyindustries and healthcare facilities is one of the ingredients that willcontribute to the success of the use of technologies in healthcare.andM;However, the need for better and increased technologies is a fact that nobodycan deny, Martin told an audience at a CADAPSO (Canadian Association of DataProcessing and Professional Services Organizations) Management Conference inOttawa last month.andM;Steve Rushing, director for a Dallas-based Andersen Consulting centre calledHospital of The Future, puts it more bluntly: &quot;I firmly believe that thestage of computerization in the healthcare industry is in a primitive state.&quot;andM;Through the Hospital of the Future centre, Rushing says he hopes to raiseawareness of the need to integrate more technologies into healthcare.andM;Keeping in mind that medicine is one of the most information-intenseprofessions and therefore an ideal target for automation, Andersen Consultingopened the Hospital of the Future in May.andP;  It is a working model ofintegrated computer systems and technologies supporting healthcare delieriesin the 1990s.andM;The Hospital of the Future is used by Andersen for the study anddemonstration of emerging technologies and techniques to integrate them, saysRushing.andM;&quot;We believed the industry needed a centre such as this,&quot; he says, adding thatit is one of several models Andersen Consulting has built in order todemonstrate how to effectively integrate state-of-the-market technologies inbusiness environments ranging from supermarkets to factories.andM;The Andersen Consulting healthcare practice consists of more than 100partners and 500 staff consultants in 25 offices worldwide, says Rushing.andP;  Itserves more than 1,100 healthcare clients worldwide.andM;He pointed out that six new products have been added to the Hospital of theFuture, helping it reach its goal of being &quot;as dynamic as possible.&quot;andM;Some of those products include a Grid Pad from Grid Systems Corp. of Fremont,Calif., a notebook-size computer that recognizes handwriting for ordercommunication and results reporting; a nationwide network that will connecthealthcare enterprises with a variety of business partners; and, wirelessnetworking capabilities which will make it possible to communicate betweenportable bedside terminals and nursing stations without having to useexpensive and fixed inflexible cabling.andM;&quot;Hospital of the Future will never be a static centre,&quot; says Rushing,&quot;because technology is always changing.&quot;andM;To meet those changes in technology, healthcare facilities are planning toincrease their expenditures in information technology, according to thelatest Canadian healthcare computer survey conducted by the Kennedy Group, aCalifornia-based research firm.andM;The 1988/1989 survey, the latest one available, reports that the extent offinancial commitment that healthcare institutions have undertaken from acapital and operating perspective will increase over the next five years.andM;About 30 per cent of the respondents of the survey showed that they will beincreasing their information systems operating budget between one and 10 percent within the next five years.andP;  Respondents of the survey included acutehealthcare facilities of more than 150 beds and other healthcare facilitieswith over 200 beds in size.andM;That survey suggests a long time before patients will be admitted to thehospital of the future.andP;  But according to Clinidata's Porte, acquiring newinformation systems to improve patient care &quot;is the way of the future.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
