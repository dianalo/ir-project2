Strong Los Angeles, CaliforniaandM;ENTERTAINING DVORAKandM;John C. Dvorak's critique of certain IBM employees' social graces, followedby his comments about SAA (&quot;My Dinner with IBM,&quot; PC Magazine, January 31,1989), raises questions about his objectivity.andP;  What does it take tofavorably impress a computer columnist?andP;  I am not a big fan of many of IBM'srecent actions and I agree that IBM is not the best business entertainer inthe industry, but so what?andM;It is not their business, nor that of any other vendor, to entertain computercolumnists.andP;  Would Dvorak's stated dislike of the Micro Channel architectureand IBM itself have been mollified by a good steak, a bottle of wine, andpleasant conversation (all free, of course)?andP;  Mark Tucker East Montpelier,VermontandM;I do not always agree with John C. Dvorak, but I must say that he was correctin his observations on IBM.andP;  Most IBM employees do have more class and tactthan those Mr. Dvorak encountered at dinner.andP;  But, in Big Blue's drive forgreater profits, a school of thought has formed in the heart of itsmarket-driven management that puts little value on personal relationships.andO;Instead, getting the job done, regardless of cost, is the first priority.andM;These people have either forgotten, or were never taught, that professionaletiquette begins with personal etiquette.andP;  Not only is it an honor and aprivilege to have the mealtime company of another, but it is the obligationof the party extending the invitation to pick up the tab.andP;  There is adifference between playing hardball like a sportsman and playing hardballlike a prima donna athlete.andP;  Some of the people who work for IBM should besent down to the minor leagues.andP;  David N. Heller Reston, VirginiaandM;STRAIGHT TALK ABOUT DRIVESandM;Your writers communicate valuable information in a most effective manner.andP;  Ineeded to know more about the hard disk drive in the Model 30 286 (&quot;What'sOld Is New,&quot; PC Magazine, January 17, 1988), and your article contained allthe information I needed and then some.andP;  George E. Remp, Jr.andP;  Upper Darby,PennsylvaniaandM;WHY NOT SHAREWARE?andM;I feel you committed a great injustice by not mentioning shareware in yourlist of awards and kudos (&quot;The Best of 1988&quot;).andP;  Not everyone requires theultimate product from some distant software house that cannot or will notsupport the user.andP;  For most of us, shareware is an excellent route to greaterproductivity.andP;  James R. Plosay Monterey, CaliforniaandM;TIARA LANCARD DESERVES BETTERandM;I can't believe the short shrift Frank Derfler gave the Tiara LanCard E(&quot;Building Workgroup Solutions: Ethernet Cards,&quot; PC Magazine, January 31,1989).andP;  The 8-bit LanCard is the throughput equal of the fastest 16-bitboard.andP;  Its degradation from zero to four stations is a remarkable 7 percent,and it's faster over four stations than any other 8-bit card with zerostations.andP;  Michael Friedlander Ossining, New YorkandM;CLIPPED AGAIN?andM;Bill Machrone's kudos for the Curtis Clip were premature (&quot;The Best of 1988,&quot;PC Magazine, January 17, 1989).andP;  There's no spring in the clip, so afteryou've tucked a couple of sheets of paper under it a couple of times, singlesheets fall off.andP;  And, of course, the more sheets you use each time, the moreit needs the next time.andM;This product is another example of American marketing: build it, hype it, andsell it.andP;  Let the public discover that it doesn't work.andP;  By then, thecompany's been bought out and the executives have floated to their Caribbeancabanas on platinum parachutes.andP;  Ron Rodriguez Lafayette, CaliforniaandM;SEND ME A LETTERandM;What's all the fuss about printing envelopes on a LaserJet (&quot;Printing thePerfect Envelope,&quot; PC Magazine, December 13, 1988)? Why all the ink forspecial programs and utilities?andM;I use a Wang PC and a LaserJet to print #10 envelopes and have never had aproblem.andP;  I position the cursor on the first letter of the inside address andEnter GL + E.andP;  The macro picks up the inside address, drops it on the lastpage of the document, adds the correct number of returns to position thecopy, and prompts me to change the left margin to 70 when printing.andP;  Perfectevery time.andP;  Peter Obletz New York, New YorkandM;NON-TECHIES NEED HELP, TOOandM;Although your magazine contains very useful information, I feel that some ofyour articles tend to assume that the reader is already a technical expert onthe topic under discussion.andP;  I would like to be able to gain new informationfrom your articles, not just enhance my existing knowledge.andP;  Lori TrawickMontgomery, AlabamaandM;CONNECTIONS GET YOU SO FARandM;The two-edge connector board issue sounds like a nightmare to John C.andP;  Dvorak(&quot;EISA Come, EISA Go!&quot; PC Magazine, December 27, 1988), but unless I mustplug and unplug a board each time I boot up my computer, I'm not going toworry about it.andP;  In the 2 years that I've had my AT system, I've only openedit twice and unplugged a board once.andM;Why doesn't Mr. Dvorak design and produce his own board, and we'll see whofollows him?andP;  Rick Carlson Meriden, ConnecticutandM;I DON'T DO WINDOWSandM;Stephen Manes really hit home (&quot;New Versions, Old Pains,&quot; PC Magazine,October 11, 1988).andP;  Most so-called upgrades now favor windows.andP;  This is finefor illiterates, but when one learned computing with only 16K of BASIC and16K of RAM, a window is wasted memory.andP;  I'll stick with my unclutteredscreen.andP;  Walt Stevenson Pittsburg, KansasandM;THE MISSING AMERICANandM;I am very surprised at your choice of top desktop system (&quot;5th Annual Awardsfor Technical Excellence,&quot; PC Magazine, January 17, 1989).andP;  I do not thinkthat the ALR cache technology was sufficiently unique to rate first place.andO;More importantly, the Wells American CompuStar was completely ignored in therunners up categories.andM;The Wells modular system is a quantum leap in hardware refinement, takingremovable backplane technology in desktop publishing to its logicalconclusion.andP;  The Wells American organization is just that--American--anddeserves all our support for their innovative approach and high-qualityoutput.andP;  Bill Copenhaven Richmond, CaliforniaandM;SMART MONEYandM;I have to question how closely Donald Trivette evaluated all three productsbefore he chose MoneyMate to be the &quot;real star&quot; and &quot;buy&quot; of the threepersonal finance packages reviewed in After Hours, PC Magazine, December 27,1988.andP;  I have used Home Finance System III since its introduction andconsider it a smart software system that uses fast assembly language toincorporate unique design features that were not even mentioned.andP;  Roy H.andO;Andree Lake Ronkonkoma, New YorkandM;THANKS FOR EVERYTHINGandM;I would like to thank everyone at PC Magazine and PC MagNet for theirwonderful magazine and BBS.andP;  PC Magazine is a constant source of helpfulinformation.andP;  The only addition I can possibly think of would be a swimsuitissue.andP;  John Rago, Jr.andP;  Moccasin, CaliforniaandM;BUT DOES IT RUN OS/2?andM;I was very disappointed that your review of 286 machines (&quot;The 80286: Unsafeat Higher Speeds?&quot; PC Magazine, December 27, 1988) didn't test for OS/2compatibility.andP;  Why was this claim not tested? It's a make-or-break point forme, as I would not invest in a machine that didn't run OS/2.andP;  Andy KleinGlendale, ArizonaandM;I NEED MY SPACEandM;For many of your readers, PFS: First Choice is the last choice (&quot;The Best of1988&quot;).andP;  I do my work on a Zenith laptop with no hard disk, and I find thatthe size of First Choice gets in the way of its use.andP;  With its .EXE file aswell as all the overlays, the program requires two disks exclusive of datafiles.andP;  For now, I'll stick to Microsoft Works for my integrated programbecause it's functional and fits on one 720K disk with its spelling checker.andO;Richard B. Thomas Tacoma, WashingtonandM;CORRECTIONS/AMPLIFICATIONSandM;The new Intel 80386SX processor is 16 MHz, not 12 MHz (&quot;Take It or Leave It:Portables with Desktop Power,&quot; PC Magazine, October 11, 1988).andM;HOW TO WRITE TO PC MAGAZINEandM;Send letters to PC Magazine, One Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016, or uploadthem to PC MagNet (see the Productivity section for access information).andP;  Allletters become the property of PC Magazine and are subject to editing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
