The price-cutting was started last Thursday by Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers, the U.K. stockbrokerage unit of the largest U.S. banking concern, Citicorp. Citicorp Scrimgeour narrowed its dealing spreads, or the difference between its buying and selling prices, 25% to 30% for most U.K. blue-chip stocks. Soon after, Union Bank of Switzerland's Phillips andamp; Drew stockbrokerage unit also slashed its market-making margins.    But the firms' bids to lure new customers didn't score any immediate successes, as most of London's most powerful houses quickly matched the price cuts. The margin-cutting means less profit for the already-battered brokerage industry here and is aimed at boosting pressure on smaller firms to abandon the overcrowded market. But dealers doubt the margin-slashing will lead any major player to quit soon.    &quot;Times are tough because volumes are low but it won't lead to immediate withdrawal,&quot; said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities in London. The securities arms of the new financial conglomerates begun here in the past few years &quot;are backed by lots of capital and might stay in there for longer than anyone thought possible,&quot; he said.    Citicorp officials said the move was intended to generate more business for the firm in London, where equity trading volume is running at 40% below levels before last October's stock market crash. &quot;It's an effort to be more competitive for our clients and increase market share,&quot; said Terry Connor, Citicorp's head equity trader in London. &quot;Whether we are going to make any money out of it in the short term is another matter.&quot;    Mr. Connor said the firm hopes lower prices will lure institutional investors back to the market. And, he added, &quot;If there is going to be polarization, or a shakeout, we see ourselves . . . in the top division.&quot;    Like many securities firms here, Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers has been wracked by internal upheaval and tough competition that followed the 1986 opening of the London markets to new overseas and domestic financial houses. Some rival brokers depict its price-cutting as a last-ditch effort to see if it can succeed as a major U.K. stockbrokerage. But Mr. Connor rejected such speculation. &quot;We intend to be here,&quot; he said. &quot;This is in keeping with our strategy to build a first-class business by 1989 or 1990.&quot;    Citicorp can afford to take some hits. But so can its most significant competitors. The so-called polarization already has occurred in London, where the eight biggest market-making firms regularly handle more than 75% of London equity trading. These firms, unlikely to shrink from Citicorp's challenge, include Barclays PLC's Barclays De Zoete Wedd unit, Security Pacific Corp.'s Hoare Govett unit and S.G. Warburg Group PLC.    Ultimately, the price-cutting may prove an expensive way to siphon a small amount of business from smaller market-makers. But even many of the smaller market-makers could afford to keep up with Citicorp for a while, including units of Chase Manhattan Corp., France's Societe Generale S.A., and Switzerland's Credit Suisse. Citicorp also runs the risk of losing new customers once margins widen. Some brokers say that may happen abruptly if trading volume begins to pick up after the summer vacation period.    In the meantime, dealers in the City, London's financial district, brace for lower returns and even more cutthroat competition. &quot;At the end of the day this will end up losing everyone a lot of money,&quot; said Roger Streeter, head equities trader at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in London. </TEXT></DOC>
