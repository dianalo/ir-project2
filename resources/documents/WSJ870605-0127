In a proxy statement mailed to shareholders for a special meeting in New York today, Joy said Joy Technologies Inc., the company to be formed following the buyout, will borrow about $658.6 million in connection with the buyout. The loan will come from a syndicate of banks, a debt sale and institutional investors.    The company said that as a result, Joy Technologies' total indebtedness will equal about 92% of its total capitalization.    As previously reported, Joy last March completed the sale of its petroleum equipment business to Cooper Industries Inc., Houston, for about $57 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities by Cooper.    Among the company's remaining businesses that could be sold are units that make air machinery, molded rubber products, hydraulic devices and process equipment such as pumps and flotation cells.    Joy said the debt will result in significant interest expense -- at an average rate higher than Joy's existing indebtedness -- and principal repayment obligations, including mandatory repayments of approximately $128 million of principal prior to June 30, 1988, and approximately $125 million of additional principal prior to June 30, 1989.    The company said Joy Technologies' projected cash flow from operations won't be sufficient to satisfy its debt obligations due before June 20, 1989. As a result, Joy Technologies will have to sell &quot;a number of businesses and assets.&quot; The company projected sales in 1988 of $510 million and in 1989 of $587 million.    Joy warned that if Joy Technologies doesn't receive &quot;sufficient proceeds&quot; from asset sales, the company may have to reduce or cut certain operating or capital costs to meet its debt obligations.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company. </TEXT></DOC>
