Police found the cache belonging to a radical Jewish activist,convicted in a 1984 attempt to attack the gold-domed mosque, in theultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim, National Policespokesman Roni Yishaya said.   The Israeli daily Haaretz reported the arms were stolen from thearmy by Shimon Barda, leader of a cave-dwelling mystical Jewishsect, for a second attempt on the mosque. The daily Hadashot saidseveral more arrests were expected in the alleged plot.   Yishaya refused to comment on the reports. He confirmed two LAWmissiles were found but would not reveal what else was in the armscache.   The Dome of the Rock sits atop what is known to Jews as theTemple Mount and to Moslems as the Haram esh-Sharif, or NobleSanctuary.   The area in Jerusalem's Old City is revered by Moslems as thesite of Prophet Mohammed's ascent to heaven and by Jews as the siteof Solomon's Temple and the second Jewish temple destroyed by theRomans in 70 A.D.   Radical Jewish groups have called for removal of the Dome of theRock and adjacent Al Aqsa Mosque for creation of a new Jewishtemple.   Barda, 31, was sentenced to eight years in jail September 1985for the earlier attempt to blow up the Dome of the Rock. He escapedin mid-1988 and avoided capture until September 1989 by disguisinghimself as a bearded Jewish scholar in Mea Shaarim.   Barda led police to the arms cache on Wednesday, but it wasunclear why he revealed the hidden weapons now. Haaretz said hestole the weapons during his time out of jail.   In January 1984 Barda and two accomplices were caught hauling 28pounds of TNT and 15 hand grenades over the walls of the TempleMount. The accomplices were committed to psychiatric care but werelater released.   The three men had formed a tiny mystical sect that lived in acave in the abandoned Palestinian village of Lifta on Jerusalem'soutskirts.   The Temple Mount is a frequent source of tension between Jewsand Moslems.   It is heavily guarded by police, partly because of fears that asuccessful attack on the Moslem shrines could endanger the lives ofJews living in Islamic countries.</TEXT></DOC>
