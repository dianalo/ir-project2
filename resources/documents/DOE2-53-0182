Criteria for assessment ofmarket attractiveness were developed and are described here. Using thesecriteria and descriptions of selected advanced reactor concepts, andassessment of their projected market viability in the time period 2000-2010was made. All of these selected concepts could be considered as havingthe potential for meeting the criteria but, in most cases, considerableRandamp;D would be required to reduce uncertainties. This work and later studiesof safety and licensing of advanced, passively safe reactor conceptsby ORNL are described. The results of these studies are taken into accountin most of the current (FY 1989) work at ORNL on advanced reactors. Abrief outline of this current work is given. One of the current Randamp;D effortsat ORNL which addresses the operability and safety of advanced reactorsis the Advanced Controls Program. Selected topics from this Program aredescribed. 13 refs., 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
