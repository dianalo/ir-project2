The nation's economy is dependent on foreign trade and continuesto recover due to strong export demand in the United States andother industrialized countries, the report said.   The economy stumbled into recession in 1985 and partiallyrecovered with a 1.8 percent growth rate in 1986, which surged to8.8 percent last year.   Domestic demand, an increase in tourism and the recovery of theneighboring Indonesian and Malaysian economies boosted the island'strade and economic growth last year, according to the embassyreport.   But ``despite a favorable demand outlook for Singapore's goodsand services for the rest of 1988, persistent labor shortages arecausing many manufacturers to consider delaying new investmentprojects,'' the report said.   ``The outlook for the economy beyond 1988 depends heavily on thehealth of Singapore's trading partners,'' it said. ``Globaleconomic uncertainties, the threat of protectionism and strainedpolitical relations could cloud Singapor's investment climate.''</TEXT></DOC>
