The lawmakers agreed to halt the steady decline infarm-income supports under the expiring 1985 farm bill, andto give farmers a somewhat freer hand to grow the crops theywant without losing their eligibility for subsidies. But theSenate made only a stab at frugality, putting off anysignificant reductions in farm spending until budgetnegotiators can agree on a package of spending cuts andtaxes.</LP><TEXT>   The bill was approved 70-21 Friday after SenateAgriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) andSen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, the panel's rankingRepublican, prevailed in seven long days of floorskirmishing, fending off all but a few attempts to alter thecompromise package that they had fashioned in committee. Onenotable amendment they couldn't defeat would phase out honeysubsidies for commercial beekeepers over the next four years.   The House expects to finish work on its version of the1990 farm bill this week, and after Congress returns from itsAugust recess, a conference will begin reconcilingdifferences between the two measures. Bush administrationofficials already have threatened a presidential veto unlesssubstantial cuts are made. Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, theRepublican leader, warned that $6 billion to $18 billion mayyet have to be slashed from the agriculture budget over thefive-year life of the bill.   But for now, most senators were inclined to take an upbeatview. &quot;This is a good, solid, progressive farm bill,&quot; saidSen. Leahy. &quot;It is an environmentally conscious farm bill.&quot;   The legislation would expand the Conservation ReserveProgram to include environmentally sensitive land, and itwould set up a new program of easements to protect wetlands.Under another new program, the government would pay farmersas much as $3,500 a year for changing their farming practicesto curb chemical contamination of wells and watercourses.   The bill also would revamp the so-called swampbusterprogram. Farmers would be allowed to drain small wetlands aslong as they restored former wetlands of equal or largersize. The bill would make it easier to apprehend farmers whoconverted wetlands to crop production, while imposinggraduated fines for inadvertent violations of the swampbusterprovision. Currently, farmers can lose all their subsidiesand farm-program benefits -- otherwise known as the drop-deadpenalty -- for tilling wetlands.   Sen. Leahy also called the bill &quot;a victory for consumers.&quot;It would break the &quot;circle of poison,&quot; banning the exportingof pesticides barred from use by U.S. farmers and theimporting of fruit tainted with these pesticides. Inaddition, the legislation would create a special label fororganically produced fruit, vegetables and other crops thathave been certified to meet minimum federal organicstandards.   The commodity provisions would, among other things, givefarmers the option to plant a variety of crops on 25% of theacreage they customarily devote to subsidized crops. But intaking advantage of this flexibility, they would forgo anysubsidies on that land. The objective is to have farmers makeplanting decisions in response to market demand, rather thanincentives created by the subsidy programs.   The bill would freeze target prices for almost all majorcrops for the next five years, and it would create marketingloans for wheat, feed grains and oil-seed crops, includingsoybeans and sunflowers. Marketing loans are designed toprevent the buildup of government-owned surpluses bypromoting exports. In addition, the bill would impose a dairyfloor price of $10.10 per hundred pounds of milk.   The milk floor price and marketing loan proposals areamong the innovations in the bill that the administrationstrongly opposes from the standpoint of farm policy and cost.In the light of the budget crisis, the Senate bill has a&quot;surreal aspect to it,&quot; said John Campbell, a seniorAgriculture Department official. &quot;It's business as usual.&quot;   &quot;It's very difficult for the legislative branch toexercise restraint in an election year,&quot; said AgricultureSecretary Clayton Yeutter. Nine of the Senate AgricultureCommittee's 19 members are up for re-election.   Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.) denounced the bill for notbeing generous enough. He predicted that insufficientfarm-income supports would &quot;create ghost towns in ruralAmerica&quot; as 500,000 farmers go out of business in the 1990s.   The bill doesn't include a food stamp and nutritionsection, but Sen. Leahy has promised to add one during theHouse-Senate conference. To the administration'sconsternation, the House has proposed a $5.5 billionexpansion in food stamp spending.</TEXT></DOC>
