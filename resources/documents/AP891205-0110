A rebel source said the insurgents, who are seeking to oustPresident Corazon Aquino, might refuse to allow all the Americansto leave. More than 200 Americans were believed to be trapped.   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theinsurgents would release all Asian and European tourists but ``theintention is not to release Americans'' because of U.S. support forMrs. Aquino.   Fighting spilled over into exclusive neighborhoods near wherethe ambassadors of the United States, China and the Soviet Unionlive. U.S. officials said Ambassador Nicholas Platt would not bespending the night in his residence.   In Washington today, the U.S. administration expressed concernfor the safety of American tourists and businessmen unable to leavethe Philippines and said there remains ``some uncertainty'' abouttheir status.   President Bush is keeping options open as he weighs the best wayto protect American citizens, White House spokesman MarlinFitzwater said.   ``You can be assured that the Pentagon has contingency plans foreverything,'' Fitzwater said, while declining to elaborate on whatadditional military steps the United States might take.   The strain of captivity, fear of violence and the uncertaintybegan to take their toll on the Americans held.   ``It's very frustrating with the government and with thereformists (rebels),'' Allan Campbell, 61, of Lancaster, Pa., toldreporters allowed to enter the Intercontinental Hotel briefly.``We're getting angry now at both sides.''   On Friday, the first day of the coup attempt, U.S. F-4 Phantomfighter jets flew air cover in support of pro-government forcesbattling guerrillas who were staging their sixth attempt to oustMrs. Aquino since she was swept to power in 1986.   More than 74 people have been killed and more than 500 woundedsince rebels launched the bloodiest attempt yet to topple Mrs.Aquino's administration. Rebels say the elected government hasfailed to deal effectively with the country's Communist insurgency,corruption, incompetence and economic problems.   At least two people were killed and 15 wounded in today'sfighting, one of the dead a 6-year-old girl killed when a 60mmmortar fired by the rebels slammed into a squatter settlement nearthe Makati Medical Center.   In addition to the 400 or so rebels entrenched in the Makatifinancial district, a similar number still occupied Mactan Air Basein Cebu, 350 miles south of Manila, despite an ultimatum to leavethe garrison by today.   Tourism officials today prepared about 20 buses to go intoMakati to evacuate tourists to the airport, but heavy fightingforced them to halt the convoy.   After hours of negotiations with the rebels _ members of theelite 1st Scout Ranger Regiment, government negotiators said theevacuation would be delayed for at least a day.   ``They've decided to postpone it for tomorrow because it'snightfall and we don't want the tourists to be mistaken forsoldiers,'' said Rafael Alunan, undersecretary of tourism.   The insurgents on Saturday moved into the district that is hometo many foreign diplomats and journalists, taking control of about22 buildings.   The U.S. Embassy and others urged their nationals to fleeMakati, even if they lived in areas not yet touched by the fighting.   Scores of Americans arrived today at the U.S. Seafront housingcompound, which was guarded by U.S. Marines. Others moved to hotelsnear Manila Bay, about five miles west of the fighting.   The Philippine Plaza said 450 foreigners had checked into thehotel by midafternoon.   ``We're telling Americans that if they can get out safely, getout,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Jerry Huchel. ``But if theycan't, stay where you are, but keep away from upper floors.''   Huchel estimated that about 215 Americans were trapped in threeluxury hotels in Makati. The Manila Chronicle quoted militaryreports as saying nine American servicemen from U.S.-run Clark AirBase, 50 miles north of Manila, were among them.   A statement distributed to news organizations in the name ofcashiered Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, a fugitive, saidthe rebels did not want to hurt civilians.   ``We would like to emphasize that what we are doing is for thegood of all the Filipino people for the longer term,'' thestatement said. ``We cannot continue with the present system inwhich the political, economic and moral fiber of this country isslowly and shamelessly rent apart by the Aquino regime under theshameless support of the U.S. imperialists in the guise ofdemocracy.''   Mutineers on Friday took over several military facilities andbombed the presidential palace. With the U.S. air support,government forces counterattacked and regained most positions.   Honasan once supported Mrs. Aquino but led an August 1987attempt to overthrow her.</TEXT></DOC>
