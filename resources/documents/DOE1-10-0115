A model gasifier-motor-generator was acquiredand assembled on a mobile platform first for testing and then field trialsin Saskatchewan. The system performed satisfactorily. The gasificationefficiency was between 75 and 80 percent. The efficiency for conversionof wood to usable electricity was dependent upon the load and variedfrom 4 to 14 percent for 20 to 80 percent of the generating capacity.Analysis of electricity cost over a ten year period using wood gasification-motor-generatorvs. diesel generator indicated a levelized electricity cost (1981 dollars)equal to 0.204 $/kWh for wood and 0.130 $/kWh for diesel system. Highlabor charges for wood gasification made it less attractive. Analysisof key economic parameters showed that a significant reduction of electricitycost can be obtained for wood systems if additional automation is introducedat a moderate increase of capital cost.</TEXT></DOC>
