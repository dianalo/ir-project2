Reeling from the unprecedented frugality of America'sleisure class, purveyors of luxury goods have been forced tobecome downright miserly with their advertising budgets. Andin turn, that has sent shock waves through what was, at leastuntil recently, the buffered world of upscale magazines.</LP><TEXT>   The numbers tell the story. So far this year, magazinesthat target assorted beautiful people have been hit evenharder by declining ad pages than their more pedestriancounterparts. On average, magazine ad pages dropped 10.4%between January and July, according to Publishers InformationBureau. But at society stalwart Town andamp; Country, ad pagesplummeted 36.6%, while Architectural Digest's ad pages fell28.4%, and Art andamp; Antiques' dropped 27.9%.   Publishers of luxury magazines -- once thought to bevirtually immune to recession -- admit that the slump caughtthem off-guard.   &quot;This is certainly a departure from past recessions,&quot; saysJack Rehm, president and chief executive of Meredith Corp.,publisher of Metropolitan Home. Adds David A. McCann, Town andamp;Country's publisher: &quot;Nearly every major advertiser we dealwith has cut back.&quot; The consensus is that the very categoriesthat boomed in the '80s -- travel products, cars, real estateand cosmetics -- are now especially weak.   To try to explain what is going on, the magazine-mongerspoint to a confluence of disparate events. Fears of terrorismcaused by the Persian Gulf War discouraged travel. Plummetingreal estate values and a series of scandals in the financialservices sector made even the most affluent consumersskittish. Meanwhile, turmoil in the retailing industry hasmany department stores clamoring for marketers' money tosupport their advertising efforts.   &quot;There is tremendous pressure from retailers to contributeto their cooperative programs and that inevitably cuts intoour national ad spending,&quot; acknowledges Karen Haskell, whooversees advertising for Nike Inc.'s upscale Cole-Haan brandof footwear. Ms. Haskell estimates that the total Cole-Haanad budget is down &quot;significantly&quot; from last year.   Marketing experts warn that simply chopping budgets --which for highly targeted luxury brands are often small tobegin with -- can seriously undermine a prestige name.Cautions Edwin Rice, director of marketing for LandorAssociates, a San Francisco-based management consulting firm:&quot;When you have an image-driven brand, cutting back onadvertising is really dicey business.&quot;   Which is doubtless why it is only the boldest luxurymarketer who will confess to such slashing, despite thepervasiveness of the trend. But one thing is certain: Manysellers of &quot;haute luxe&quot; merchandise are overhauling theirpitches to reflect these more ascetic times. &quot;Luxury goodsare just not socially acceptable anymore,&quot; explains JackTrout, president of the marketing consulting firm Trout andamp;Ries. &quot;Advertisers will have to make affluent consumers feelless guilty about buying what they want.&quot;   In that pursuit, Tourneau Watch Co., among the nation'slargest vendors of such elite watch brands as Rolex and PatekPhilippe, has clearly shifted its focus downscale. (Thecompany also cut back &quot;slightly&quot; its ad spending in the firstquarter, according to Harvard N. Tigler, who runs thecompany's in-house ad agency.)   Earlier this summer, the Manhattan-based retailer ranfull-page ads in the New Yorker hawking &quot;vintage watches,&quot;which are in fact just used watches. Other ads urgedpotential customers to &quot;recycle&quot; their old timepieces inexchange for cash or a price break on a new watch. Mr. Tiglersays his goal wasn't to buy used watches but &quot;to makecustomers feel like they were getting a good value.&quot;   In a somewhat different twist on the same theme, CoachLeatherware, a unit of Sara Lee Corp., is no longer usingstatus to sell its line of pricey purses and briefcases. Anew print campaign, scheduled to run in consumer magazines inOctober, plays up the brand's American heritage rather thanits fashion appeal. The ads feature the descendants of suchAmerican icons as George Washington, Davy Crockett and MarkTwain -- sporting, of course, their favorite Coach accessory.   Some marketers also are beginning to look beyond upscalemagazines and newspapers in their concerted efforts to stalkthe newly thrifty rich.   Traditionally, luxury marketers have viewed tony magazinesand a few newspapers as the only media focused tightly enoughon the ultra-rich, but &quot;everyone is trying to develop morecreative ways to reach these consumers,&quot; says Ms. Haskell ofCole-Haan. She believes cable channels such as CNN mayeventually deliver a suitably upscale audience for hercompany's footware. Other options that she is consideringinclude increased point-of-sale marketing and evenbillboards.   Still, there is a mounting sense that the luxury marketmay never again feel quite as rich as it did during themid-1980s. &quot;Affluent people will still reward themselves, butI think they'll do it more quietly,&quot; says Thomas P. LoseeJr., senior vice president and publishing director for KnappCommunications Corp., which publishes Architectural Digestand Bon Appetit: &quot;I think we may have hit the high water marka few years ago.&quot;   ---   Group Makes Clio Offer                                                                                                          A group of Chicago investors has made an offer for theClio awards. But, like much about the awards' recent history,the offer is a bit murky.   Ruth L. Ratny, publisher and owner of Screen magazine, aChicago-based film trade magazine, is heading the group. Shewouldn't identify the other members. She also wouldn'tdisclose the amount of the offer, except to say that it isless than the $12 million to $14 million being sought by ClioAwards Enterprises President Bill Evans. A spokesman for Mr.Evans, however, said the offer is but one of about two dozenthe firm has received.   As previously reported, this year's presentation of theawards ended in chaos, putting the future of the Clios indoubt. A melee erupted at the print and radio awards ceremonyon June 13 after Clio officials didn't show up, and thetelevision-ad ceremony scheduled for the following week wascanceled when the event's site hadn't received a rentpayment.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
