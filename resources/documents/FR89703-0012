The authority for thisproposed regulation is contained in the Tobacco Adjustment Act of 1983,as amended (7 U.S.C. 511r).Imported tobacco is inspected for grade and quality using the same standardsapplied to tobacco marketed through a warehouse in the United States. Feesare assessed to cover the cost of providing this grading service. The feefor grading imported tobacco has been $.0035 per pound since 1984.The Department proposes to increase the fee to $.0040 per pound. This feewas determined after an annual review and analysis was conducted of thefinancial status of the program. The major factors generating the needfor additional funds are increases in salaries, travel allowances and overalladministrative costs since 1984.This proposed rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures establishedto implement Executive Order 12291 and Departmental Regulation 1512-1 andhas been determined to be ``nonmajor'' because it does not meet any ofthe criteria established for major rules under the Executive Order.Additionally, in conformance with the provisions of Pub. L. 96-354, theRegulatory Flexibility Act, full consideration has been given to the potentialeconomic impact on small business. Few, if any, of the firms which wouldbe affected by this proposed regulation are small businesses. The Administrator,Agricultural Marketing Service, has determined that this action would haveno significant economic impact upon any entity, small or large, and wouldnot substantially affect the normal movement of the commodity in the marketplace.Compliance with this revision would not impose substantial direct economiccosts, recordkeeping, or personnel workload changes on small entities,and it would not alter the market share or competitive positions of smallentities relative to large entities. Furthermore, the Department is requiredby law to fix and collect fees and charges to cover the Department's costin operating the tobacco inspection program.All persons who desire to submit written data, views, or arguments forconsideration in connection with this proposal may file them with the Director,Tobacco Division, AMS, USDA, Room 502 Annex Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington,DC 20090-6456, not later than August 2, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 29</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Tobacco.Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend the regulations in 7 CFRPart 29, Subpart B, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 29_[AMENDED]</ITAG> 1.
