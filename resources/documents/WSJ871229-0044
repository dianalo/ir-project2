The telecommunications concern said it sought the extension because of the recent &quot;significant improvement&quot; in its operating earnings and cash flow.    The extension applies to a standstill agreement reached in October 1985, when IBM acquired a 16.6% stake in MCI in exchange for IBM's Satellite Business Systems unit. The extension gives MCI until Dec. 31, 1988, to sell IBM as much as $300 million of debentures, or MCI preferred stock, to raise capital. In addition, MCI retains an option to sell IBM an additional $100 million of debt securities through 1988.    If those sales are executed, IBM would have the right to convert the securities into MCI common stock at a 30% premium over the market value of the stock at the time of the investment.    Meanwhile, MCI said IBM will continue to hold its 47 million shares of MCI common at least until Jan. 1, 1990. IBM has agreed that it won't acquire more than a 30% stake in MCI without MCI's approval. </TEXT></DOC>
