The rivers that run into the PacificOcean from Alaska to California were once home to one of theworld's largest populations of salmon and steelhead. Most ofthese wild runs have now vanished.   The danger to the fish is the consequence of more than 50years of market-suppressing congressional legislation. Thisyear's energy bill ought to help reverse that trend.</LP><TEXT>   Over the years Congress has authorized hundreds ofhydropower, water supply, flood control, shipping, timber,agriculture and fishing programs on the rivers of theNorthwest -- 30 major dams and reservoirs on the ColumbiaRiver alone. Operated by more than a dozen federal agencieswithout much input from markets, they have been majordestroyers of salmon and steelhead habitats.   To be more salmon-friendly, water releases and reservoirsshould produce more hydro-electricity in the summer and fall,when adult salmon need high water levels to swim upstream tospawn, and less in the spring, when young salmon require aquick journey to the sea.   Fortunately, summer and fall is also when the demand forpower is greatest in the air-conditioned Western states. Theneeds of the fish and the market meet. Unfortunately, theneeds of fish and 50 years of accumulated government-imposedrules do not.   The dams of the Northwest do not release water when thesalmon and most Western states need them to because theirelectricity output's access to the Western electric powergrid is extremely limited. So they have no incentive toreduce power reservoir levels and releases in the spring,thereby making more water available for electricitygeneration later in the year.   A major source of the problem is the Western water rule,&quot;Use it or lose it.&quot; Holders of water rights are often notallowed to resell their rights to others willing to buy them:   -- Idaho's water law prohibits sales of diversion rightsto out-of-state users -- even to protect Idaho salmon.   -- Washington state allows transfers, but only stateagencies can hold these rights.   -- Oregon's law discourages water market transactions byskimming portions of any sale into the state's accounts.   -- California has a hard-line system featuring astate-monopoly water bank, fixed prices, the selection bygovernment of &quot;qualified&quot; buyers and sellers -- and a deficitthis year of more than $35 million.   If the law permitted water rights and powercontract-holders to resell their electricty through theWestern transmission grid into the inter-regional market,many would do so -- especially in the peak summer and fallseasons -- since the market price is at least double theirown cost. They, and the salmon, would profit.   The House version of the energy bill authorizes theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission to determine theconditions and prices under which electric utilities andother power line operators would be required to grant accessto the power grid. But the bill contains a special exemptionfor the Columbia River transmission system -- the system mostcrucial to the salmon.   Similar changes could be made in the laws governing watersupplies. Excessive diversions of water for irrigationfarming and mining can make rivers uninhabitable for wildsalmon. If farmers were allowed to sell their water rights toother users, many farmers would find it lucrative to reducewater use, and sell their rights to downstream hydroelectricproducers instead. This &quot;freed up&quot; water could then remain inthe river -- and would, incidentally, produce a betterhabitat for wild salmon and other fish and wildlife.   Water law reforms by state legislatures are urgentlyneeded to remove barriers to water transactions, as are billsin Congress to allow extra-project water sales of all federalwater contracts. Current bills attempting to do this forCalifornia's Central Valley Project and Washington's YakimaProject represent progress.   Government subsidies to farmers, cattle-ranching and thetimber industry add to the salmon mortality rate. Subsidieskeep production of grain, beef and wood going on otherwiseunprofitable land. Wild salmon spawning grounds and migrationroutes are degraded by the resulting runoff of silt andagrichemicals, as well as by water temperature increases andreduced river flows. There are already many reasons for theabolition of farm subsidies, and the reform of the TaylorGrazing Act and the Multiple Use-Sustained Yield forestrylaw. Saving salmon and steelhead is one more.   Improvements in salmon habitat will come to nothing,however, if the salmon continue to be overfished. TheU.S.-Canada Pacific Salmon Treaty aspires to &quot;preventoverfishing and provide maximum production&quot; of salmon fromOregon to Alaska. The treaty does not, however, define or capsalmon catch rights, undermining both sustained fishing andinternational trading. Domestically, regulations under theMagnuson Act try to limit the salmon catch by &quot;time on thewater,&quot; and not by actual numbers of fish caught.   The predicament of the salmon in the Pacific Northwest isa difficult one for both environmentalists andindustrialists. The long history of government allocation ofnatural resources -- with the original intent to promotewater and power use and the later intent to save species --has to be considered outmoded at best. Government can solvesome problems, but the blanket exclusion of markets, thepresent situation on the rivers of the Northwest, is not wisepolicy.   ---   Mr. Willey is an economist at the Environmental DefenseFund in Oakland, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
