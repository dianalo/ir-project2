More than 20,000 people chanting ``Solidarity!'' and``Independence!'' marched from St. John's Cathedral in Warsaw's OldTown area to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier following a RomanCatholic Mass at the church.   Later police fired tear gas and charged about 1,000 young peoplegathered at the tomb when some of the youths threw sticks at police,witnesses reported. They said demonstrators scattered and at least10 were detained.   Rallies were held in at least eight other cities _ Gdansk,Krakow, Wroclaw, Lublin, Lodz, Poznan, Tarnow and Katowice.Opposition activists said police battled demonstrators in Gdansk,Poznan, Krakow, Tarnow and Katowice.   They had few details on the clashes in Tarnow, which took placeafter a Mass. Three people were taken to a hospital after beingbeaten by police in the southern industrial city of Katowice, saidMaria Moczulska, a spokeswoman for the illegal Confederation for anIndependent Poland.   In Gdansk, the Baltic port city where the now-outlawed Solidarityunion movement was born, more than 25,000 people attended a Mass,said opposition spokeswoman Joanna Wojciechowicz.   She said some of them tried to organize a march and policeattacked with water cannon and clubs and arrested about 10demonstrators.   Many people shouted ``Lenin is yours, the shipyard is ours!,''she added.   The violence ended when Bishop Tadeusz Goclawski appealed to thepolice commander to recall his officers and allow the crowd todisperse, Ms. Wojciechowicz said.   Solidarity was founded at the Lenin Shipyard during strikes inAugust 1980. Communist authorities announced this month that theywill close the shipyard beginning Dec. 1 because it is losing money.Solidarity was suspended in December 1981 and outlawed the followingyear.   Police in Poznan battled about 4,000 demonstrators and arrestedscores of people, according to a Solidarity activist.   Witnesses said about 10,000 people participated in a rally inKrakow and later groups of young people engaged in running streetfights with police.   The official news agency PAP reported ``aggressive'' protests inseveral cities and said: ``In some cities demonstrations andattempts to disturb public order were undertaken by irresponsiblegroups of youth.''   The Warsaw demonstrators marched to the Tomb of the Unknownsoldier carrying banners bearing the names of various illegalopposition groups: Solidarity, Confederation for an IndependentPoland, the Independent Students' Association and the PolishSocialist Party.   At the Mass, Warsaw Bishop Wladyslaw Miziolek told worshipers,``The independence of Poland is the concern of every generation.''   Authorities put on the most elaborate celebration ever undercommunist rule to mark the creation in 1918 of the capitalist,anti-Soviet republic in Poland between the two world wars. It wasthe first time such lavish attention has been paid to Poland'sinterwar leader, Marshal Jozef Pilsudski.   On Nov. 11, 1918, a civil council in Warsaw turned over militarypower to Pilsudski, who had just been released from a German prison.He proclaimed an independent Polish state and disarmed the remainingGerman troops in the capital.   The re-establishment of Poland after 123 years of beingpartitioned between Prussia, Austria and Russia fulfilled the dreamof generations of patriots.   A Catholic ``Mass for the Fatherland'' celebrated by thecountry's chief military chaplain was televised Friday, one of thefew such services ever shown on state-run TV outside of Christmasand papal visits.   The celebrations sharply contrasted with treatment of theanniversary in the past. Private groups who tried to organizemarches on the date every year after 1974 faced sharp repression.   In the western city of Poznan, a battle erupted between riotpolice and about 4,000 demonstrators, said Solidarity activistAlexandra Bessert. She said the fighting lasted about two hours anddescribed police as ``unusually aggressive and brutal.''   She said scores of people were detained.   The officer on duty at city police headquarters denied there wasany police action. ``Poznan is a very peaceful city,'' he said, thenhung up.   In Wroclaw, Jozef Pinior, a leader of the banned Polish SocialistParty, said marchers walked to a street-car depot where the localSolidarity chapter began in 1980, carrying signs saying, ``We wantfree elections'' and ``Reform through democracy.''   He said the crowd started with 3,000 people and grew to 10,000.   In Lublin, in southeastern Poland, Bishop Boleslaw Pylakcelebrated Mass and Ryszard Bender, a parliament deputy who hascalled for making Nov. 11 a national holiday, addressed a rally onthe city's main square, Bender said by phone.   Official attitudes toward the anniversary have softened since the1981 declaration of martial law, with the military governmentembracing popular patriotic symbols and urging unity in the name ofthe ``Ojczyzna'' or ``Fatherland.''   On the broad expanse of Victory Square, Polish Communist Partyleader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, wearing his army uniform andaccompanied by Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, presided athourlong official ceremonies.   Honor guards representing various branches and divisions of themilitary paid homage to the nation, and ambassadors to Poland laidwreathes at the unknown soldier's tomb.</TEXT></DOC>
