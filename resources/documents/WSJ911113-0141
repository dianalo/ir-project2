(FDC)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)TEXAS (TX)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   A federal judge in Houston rejected 99% of the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp.'s $281 million claim against MCorp,leaving the agency with a claim of just $2.2 million againstthe Texas bank holding company.   At the same time, U.S. District Judge Lynn N. Hughes ruledthat MCorp's counterclaims against the FDIC are sufficient tooffset the agency's claims, denying the FDIC standing to voteon MCorp's bankruptcy reorganization plan.</LP><TEXT>   The ruling yesterday effectively knocks out the largestsingle claim against MCorp and could allow the holdingcompany to distribute more cash to its creditors. As part ofhis ruling, Judge Hughes said MCorp is entitled to $14.5million in income tax payments that were supposed to flowfrom the bank units to the holding company.   A spokesman for the FDIC said the agency may have groundsfor an appeal of Judge Hughes's ruling. At the minimum, thespokesman said, the FDIC will object to the confirmation ofMCorp's reorganization plan. A hearing on the confirmation isscheduled for today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. Ifthe plan is confirmed, MCorp could begin paying itscreditors.   The FDIC had alleged that MCorp wrongly enriched itself atthe expense of its bank units, 20 of which were taken over bythe FDIC in March 1989 in what was then the third largestbank failure in U.S. history. The holding company was forcedinto bankruptcy-court protection by bondholders shortlybefore its bank units were taken over.   Since then, MCorp and the FDIC have been battling infederal courts in Houston and Dallas over various issuesarising from the takeover. So far, MCorp is winning. Earlierthis year, U.S. District Judge Robert W. Porter of Dallasruled that the FDIC improperly forced the insolvency of 12MCorp bank units. Judge Porter hadn't assessed damagesagainst the FDIC before he died last week.</TEXT></DOC>
