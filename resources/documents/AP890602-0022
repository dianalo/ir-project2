Schools turning out extremely high percentages of delinquentborrowers will face an escalating series of corrective and punitiveactions under new regulations announced Thursday by EducationSecretary Lauro Cavazos.   Cavazos also said his department will take administrative stepsand submit a package of legislative proposals to Congress as partof a strategy to ease the default problem, which is expected tocost taxpayers $1.8 billion this fiscal year.   ``There are some unscrupulous and uncaring institutions outthere who are taking advantage of a program designed to help ourstudents, not financially shackle them,'' Cavazos said. He saidsuch schools ``promise to educate but deliver only a debt.''   The prime targets of the crackdown are for-profit vocationalschools which have an average default rate of 40 percent, comparedto 20 percent for community colleges and about 10 percent for othertypes of institutions. The top 10 schools on a list released by thedepartment were all trade schools with default rates topping 80percent.   Officers of two major proprietary school associations called theCavazos approach definitely preferable to the plan advanced a yearago by his predecessor, William Bennett.   Bennett's plan called for punitive proceedings against allschools with default rates above 20 percent. Cavazos said thatwould have affected 2,500 schools and been impossible for thedepartment to administer.   Under his approach, schools must have default rates over 60percent to trigger proceedings to limit, suspend or terminate theirparticipation in the huge student loan program. Those at 40 to 60percent will have to reduce their rate by 5 percent a year to avoidtriggering the proceedings. The system takes effect Jan. 1, 1991.   Less Draconian steps such as default management plans, delayedloan disbursements and pro-rata refunds will be required at lowerlevels.   Stephen Blair, president of the 1,250-member NationalAssociation of Trade and Technical Schools, called the Cavazosregulations ``thoughtful and reasonable. They tailor remedies tothe situation. We're confident they will make a difference. Theywill substantially reduce the defaults.''   Jim Phillips, executive vice president of the Association ofIndependent Colleges and Schools, a group of business schoolsoperating at 1,100 locations, said a positive feature of the newregulations is their delayed implementation.   ``Secretary Cavazos at least ... is giving the institutionsenough time to first of all be forewarned about what's coming andsecond of all to do something about it if they can,'' he said.   ``My concern is the latter _ whether there is anything elsethese institutions can do to solve what is still more of a socialproblem than an education problem,'' Phillips added, referring tothe high proportion of low-income, inner-city, academically riskystudents served by proprietary schools.   At his news conference, Cavazos said that type of problem wouldbe considered ``on a case-by-case basis ... There is not anabsolute cutoff. We are going to work with these schools.''   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Educationand Labor Committee, called the Cavazos package ``a moreconstructive approach'' than the one taken by Bennett and said hewould work with the department.   But Hawkins said he would look very carefully at thedepartment's legislative proposals in order to make sure ``ourefforts to deal with the student loan default problem (do) notexcessively punish privately owned schools and other institutionsof higher education with a high percentage of poor and minoritystudents.''   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Educationsubcommittee and sponsor of a default reduction bill that passedthe Senate in March, said Cavazos had taken ``a solid stepforward'' with his package.   Cavazos is asking Congress to enact a number of reforms. Hislegislative proposals would require lenders to offer studentborrowers graduated repayment schedules and bar schools from usingcommissioned recruiters. It also would require pro-rata refunds athigh-default schools for student grants as well as loans andauthorize guarantee agencies to withhold defaulters' wages, up to10 percent of disposable pay.   In addition, the department wants lawmakers to require thosewithout a high school diploma or its equivalent to pass anindependently developed and administered ``ability-to-benefit''test before enrolling in a course of study. Currently the schoolswrite and administer the test themselves, often after a student isenrolled.   Administrative steps are to include more frequent programreviews, audits and investigations by Education Department staffand expanded fraud detection through a toll-free hotline.   Some 4.6 million students are expected to borrow money under thestudent loan program in fiscal 1989. The program is projected tocost $5 billion this year, with 37 percent of the money going tocover defaulted loans.   According to the Education Department, the 10 schools with thenation's worst default problems, based on rates for students whowere required to start paying back loans in 1986, are:   _The Sawyer School of Business, Center Line, Mich., 93.8 percent.   _Kalamazoo Beauty Academy, Kalamazoo, Mich., 89.5 percent.   _Cambridge Business College, Detroit, 86 percent.   _Payne-Pulliam School of Trade, Detroit, 85.5 percent.   _Chicago School of Automatic Transmission, 84.7 percent.   _Odessa's College of Beauty, Gary, Ind., 83.8 percent.   _Maryland Institute of Technology, Baltimore, 83.3 percent.   _Midsouth School of Beauty, Memphis, Tenn., 82.9 percent.   _Jerome's School of Beauty Culture, New Orleans, 82.2 percent.   _Americo Technical Careers, New Orleans, 81.8 percent.   The department developed its list from statistics gathered fromguarantee agencies for loans in each state.   George Lamb, supervisor of the student loan program in Michigan,disputed the 93.8 percent default rate attributed to the Sawyerschool and said his agency may have transposed some data. InNovember 1987, when the department issued its first default list,Sawyer had a 70.88 percent default rate among students required tostart repayments in 1985, according to Education Departmentspokesman Tom Lyon.</TEXT></DOC>
