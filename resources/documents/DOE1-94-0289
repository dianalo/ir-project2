This problem of output variability is a major constrainton the number of applications and the energy contribution which can bederived from wind and solar-electric technologies. Fuel cells have recentlydemonstrated a capability to accommodate rapidly changing power demands,and may offer new hope for solving the output variability problem. Thissuggests that their combination with renewable power technologies couldyield a system which produces firm power and derives much of its energyfrom renewable resources. Such complementarity could enhance the attractivenessof wind farms and other solar operations to electric utilities. It couldalso spawn a new generation of firm power technologies for rural andisolated areas. However, there are three technical problems which mustbe addressed in order to prove that fuel cells can be successfully integratedwith wind and solar electric technologies. First, although the Gas ResearchInstitute field tests have shown that small fuel cells can follow commercialbuilding loads, the adequacy of these designs to match the more erraticoutput patterns of wind machines and wind farms is yet to be demonstrated.Second, the technological requirements for integrating fuel cells withwind and other renewable energy technologies remain to be explored. Third,it has not yet been shown whether fuel cells can compete economicallywith diesel engines as an output-leveling device for renewable powertechnologies. These three constraints are briefly discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
