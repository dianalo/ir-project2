He said he will allow the newly passed bill to become lawautomatically without his signature, but added he does not thinkthe law will withstand legal challenges.   ``I'm withholding that signature to signal our belief that aconstitutional amendment is the best way to provide lastingprotection for the flag,'' Bush told reporters at a brief WhiteHouse news conference.   A firestorm of controversy regarding the U.S. flag arose afterthe Supreme Court overturned a Texas conviction last June, rulingthat protesters could legally burn the flag under constitutionalfree-speech guarantees.   Bush proposed a new constitutional amendment against flagdesecration, but Congress chose to deal with the matter throughlegislation rather than changing the Constitution.   The legislation approved by the House and Senate put thepresident in a politically prickly position. In vetoing it, hemight have risked being seen as throwing out a pro-flag bird in thehand just for the chance to push Congress on a constitutionalamendment that would be harder to get approved.   He also found himself in a situation similar to his Democraticpresidential opponent from last year, Michael Dukakis, who vetoedflag legislation on grounds it was unconstitutional. TheMassachusetts governor was scathingly criticized by Bush forrejecting the legislation, which would have required public schoolsteachers in the state to lead pupils in daily recitations of thePledge of Allegiance.   Legislation becomes law automatically if the president does notact on it within 10 working days of when Congress sends it to theWhite House, unless Congress is in recess. Then a president canpocket-veto bills by refusing to sign them.   Bush said his decision to let it become law was not politicallymotivated.   ``I don't want to set the clock way back and rule out thelegislation, even though I don't think it's enough,'' he said.   Bush repeated his contention that the new federal legislationwill not survive court challenges. ``I can understand the rationaleof those who voted for this legislation, but in my view, it is notthe ultimate answer,'' he said.   He called the flag ``a unique and special symbol of our nationand it should be protected from desecration.''   Bush said the congressional vote was ``an overwhelmingexpression on the part of the Congress to do something about theprotection of the flag.''   The House voted 317-43 Thursday to complete congressional actionon the bill.   The measure requires up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine foranyone who ``knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles,burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flagof the United States.''   The Senate is set next week to take up a constitutionalamendment measure geared toward protecting the flag.</TEXT></DOC>
