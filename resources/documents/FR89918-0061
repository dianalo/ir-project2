Purpose</ITAG>The purpose of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (the Act) is to improveservices for and increase knowledge about runaway and homeless youth andtheir families. The Act authorizes financial assistance to establish or strengthen community-basedcenters designed to address the immediate service needs of runaway andhomeless youth and their families; fund a national communication system;provide grants to statewide and regional non-profit organizations to providetechnical assistance and training to agencies and organizations eligibleto establish and operate runaway and homeless youth centers; make grantsfor research, demonstration, and service projects; and provide informationalassistance to potential grantees interested in establishing runaway andhomeless youth centers. The Act also authorizes a transitional living grant program which has notreceived Congressional appropriations to date. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background </ITAG>The Family and Youth Services Bureau is located within the Administrationfor Children, Youth and Families, Office of Human Development Services,Department of Health and Human Services. The Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) is responsible for administeringthe Act at the Federal level. To carry out the purposes of the Act, FYSBconducts activities that address crisis needs of runaway and homeless youthand their families through the establishment or strengthening of more than340 community-based programs providing temporary shelter, counseling, andaftercare services. The Family and Youth Services Bureau also supportscoordinated network grants designed to share information, expertise, andresources among service providers, and a toll-free 24-hour National RunawaySwitchboard which serves as a neutral channel of communication betweenyoung people and their families and as a source of referral to needed services.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Annual Program Priorities </ITAG>As required by section 364 of the Act, we are proposing for public commentthe following Fiscal Year 1990 priorities in each of the program areasin the Act. We solicit specific comments and recommendations on these priorities.We also solicit suggestions for topics not covered in this announcementbut which are timely and relate to the specific needs of runaway and homelessyouth. Commentors should be aware that the Act requires 90 percent of the fundsunder the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (Part A of the Act) must beused to establish and strengthen runaway and homeless youth centers. Totalfunding under Part A of the Act for Fiscal Year 1990 is expected to beapproximately $26.9 million, depending on Congressional action. In providing suggestions and recommendations, commentors should also beaware of research and demonstration projects supported by FYSB in previousyears which include: andbullet; Foundation challenge grants for mainstreaming troubled youth andindependent living for older homeless youth; andbullet; Improving minority participation in runaway and homeless youthcenters; andbullet; Prevention of youth suicide; andbullet; Transition of homeless youth to independent living; andbullet; Work with dysfunctional families of at-risk youth; and andbullet; Prevention and treatment of alcohol abuse among minority youth.No acknowledgment will be made of the comments in response to this notice,but all comments received by the deadline will be considered in preparingthe final runaway and homeless youth funding priorities. Only the proposedpriority area statements for the research and demonstration program willbe included in the Coordinated Discretionary Program (CDP) <T4>Federal Register</T4> Announcement for FY 1990. The priority statementson the Basic Centers, National Communication System and Technical Assistanceand Training Grants will appear in a separate <T4>Federal Register</T4> announcement as in previous years. Copies ofthe final program announcements will be sent to all persons who commenton these proposed priorities. A. Priorities for Runaway and Homeless Youth Centers Section 311 of the Act authorizes the Department to make grants to publicand private entities to establish and operate local runaway and homelessyouth centers to provide services to deal primarily with the immediateneeds of runaway or otherwise homeless youth, and their families. Approximately 340 grants (of which one-third will be new awards) will befunded to support organizations which provide services to fulfill the fourmajor goals of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program. These goals are:(1) Alleviate the problems of runaway and homeless youth; (2) Reunite youth with their families and encourage the resolution of intrafamilyproblems through counseling and other services; (3) Strengthen family relationships and encourage stable living conditionsfor youth; and (4) Help youth decide upon constructive courses of action. Community-based centers that address the immediate needs (e.g., outreach,temporary shelter, counseling, and aftercare services) of runaway and homelessyouth and their families will be established or strengthened through theconduct of a competitive grant review process. The review criteria andthe accompanying application procedures will be published in a <T4>Federal Register</T4> announcement. B. Priorities for a National Communications System Section 313 of the Act authorizes the Department to make grants for a nationalcommunication system to assist runaway and homeless youth in communicatingwith their families and with service providers. In FY 1990, the National Communication System will be implemented through(1) supporting a continuation grant to support the National Runaway Switchboard(NRS) and (2) developing an interagency agreement with the National Centerfor Missing and Exploited Children, Department of Justice. The NRS willcontinue to provide information, referral and crisis counseling servicesto youth at-risk, including runaway and homeless, youth and their familiesthroughout the country. Services will continue to be available througha toll-free 24-hour telephone service which is staffed by trained volunteers.Efforts to publicize the NRS and its services will increase during fiscalyear 1990. The purpose of the interagency agreement is to improve coordinationbetween the switchboard and the National Center for Missing and Exploitedchildren so that referrals are appropriately handled. A <T4>Federal Register </T4> announcement will not be published for thisprogram priority in FY 1990. C. Priorities for Technical Assistance and Training Grants Section 314 of the Act authorizes the Secretary to make grants to statewideand regional nonprofit organizations (and combinations of such organizations)to provide technical assistance and training to public and private entitiesfor the purpose of assisting such entities to establish and operate runawayand homeless youth centers. The purpose of this program priority is to support grant activities thatprovide technical assistance and short-term training to both federallyand non-Federally funded runaway and homeless youth centers. The goalsof this priority are to strengthen the centers' capacity to provide mandatedservices, to implement innovative practices and approaches, and to expandthe coordination of services and resources between and among the centers.In FY 1990, each HHS region will have a Coordinated Networking grant andwill continue the programmatic activities originally funded in FY 1988.Therefore, no <T4>Federal Register </T4> announcement will be issued in fiscal year 1990.D. Priorities for Research, Demonstration, and Service Projects Section 315 of the Act authorizes the Department to make grants to States,localities and private entities to carry out research, demonstration, andservice projects designed to improve services for and increase knowledgeof runaway and homeless youth. This section further requires the Secretary to give special considerationto proposed projects relating to:(1) Juveniles who repeatedly leave and remain away from their homes; (2) Outreach to runaway and homeless youth; (3) Transportation of runaway and homeless youth in connection with servicesauthorized to be provided under this part; (4) The special needs of runaway and homeless youth programs in rural areas;(5) The special needs of foster care home programs for runaway and homelessyouth; (6) Transitional living programs for runaway and homeless youth; and (7) Innovative methods of developing resources that enhance the establishmentor operation of runaway and homeless youth centers.  With these statutory priorities in mind, we are proposing two priorityareas: <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Technology Transfer: Utilization of Products of Previously SupportedResearch and Demonstration Projects </ITAG><T3>Purpose:</T3> The purpose of this priority area is to review, evaluate,and prepare for dissemination information and models derived from previouslysupported research and demonstration efforts. Proposals for the empiricalevaluation of previously funded efforts will be given the highest priority.Products of this activity will increase the capability of runaway and homelessyouth centers to meet the increasing service needs of runaway and homelessyouth and their families. <T3>Background:</T3> Since 1985, the Family and Youth Services Bureau hasfunded 89 new projects in 17 subject areas under the Act. Products thathave resulted from these projects include: andbullet; Staff training manuals and other training materials includingcurricula, videotapes, computer protocols, and assessment instructions;andbullet; Screening instruments to better identify problems such as vulnerabilityto suicide; andbullet; Improved instruments for data collection to better incorporatedemographic and cultural characteristics in program planning; andbullet; Strategies for coordination at the local, State and Federal levelsamong agencies, organizations and programs to more effectively assist runawayand homeless youth and their families; andbullet; Outreach approaches to bring vulnerable, at-risk, hard to reachrunaway and homeless youth into a service delivery system; andbullet; Exemplary models of public-private partnerships, and utilizationof volunteers and peers to enhance and expand the delivery of a broad spectrumof services to help at-risk youth; and andbullet; Innovative techniques for funding service programs, includinguse of endowment funds, youth entrepreneurship and corporate involvementin the delivery of services. Comments from the field will assist in determining which issue areas willreceive priority attention for evaluation and dissemination efforts. Topicsto be considered are: (1) Working with chronic runaways; (2) Independent living; (3) Combatting juvenile prostitution; (4) Identification and treatment of abused and neglected adolescents; (5) Improved outreach and aftercare; (6) Parent/Adolescent mediation; (7) Youth suicide prevention;(8) Use of volunteers and mentors; (9) Strategies for fund raising; and (10) Employment strategies involving private industry councils. Examples of the types of activities FYSB envisions incorporating into thispriority area include: andbullet; Evaluation of a representative sample of staff training materialsand development of an action plan to improve shelter accessibility to thesetraining resources; andbullet; Coordination with a national professional association to developa report on technological innovations resulting in improved services toat-risk youth. These innovations should reflect the research and demonstrationprojects funded by FYSB in recent years. Dissemination of this report toyouth centers, policy-makers, and community and business leaders is expected.andbullet; Compilation of a list of video and computer products that havebeen developed through previously funded CDP Runaway and Homeless Youthactivities; evaluation of the quality of these videotape and computer products,and dissemination of this evaluation to center directors; and reproductionof these products for use by center directors and other youth serving agencies.andbullet; Determination of the feasibility of a national symposium to disseminateinformation and stimulate replication. andbullet; Compilation of summary presentations of successful projects, basedon a standardized format, for publication and dissemination. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Successful National Models of Interdisciplinary Cooperation BetweenLaw Enforcement Agencies and Runaway and Homeless Youth Centers </ITAG><T3>Purpose: </T3>The purpose of this priority area is to improve communicationbetween local law enforcement agencies and runaway and homeless youth centers.<T3>Background: </T3>Inappropriate placement of runaway and homeless youthin detention centers is a costly way of handling runaway, homeless, andother at-risk youth. Shelters, having already established ties with communityand service organizations, provide a natural framework for interventionand prevention of future delinquent behavior. Demonstration projects would receive support to: andbullet; Identify and describe existing barriers to police/center cooperation;andbullet; Develop, test, and evaluate new methods of improving cooperation;and andbullet; Develop methods and curricula designed to institutionalize thiscooperation, including police officer and youth worker training.  Dissemination of these models within the law enforcement and youth servicesectors would be an integral part of the activities under this priorityarea.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 13,623, Runawayand Homeless Youth.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 11, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Wade F.
