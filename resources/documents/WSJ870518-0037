Some predict the prime rate, which rose to 8 1/4% Friday from 8%, will surge at least another percentage point this summer.    Long-simmering inflation fears have escalated because of the dollar's deep slump and recent sharp price increases on many commodities. A large 0.7% increase in producer prices last month, reported Friday by the Labor Department, surprised many economists and intensified concern about the outlook for both the economy and interest rates.    Federal Reserve officials, in an effort to keep inflation from getting out of control, are likely to drive up short-term interest rates in coming weeks, according to a growing number of analysts. Some contend that the Fed will lay the groundwork for another credit-tightening move at tomorrow's meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee in Washington.    &quot;We are headed toward higher interest rates as a result of more inflation in spite of declining industrial output,&quot; predicted Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. &quot;I'm afraid it looks like a rerun of the stagflation of the early 1980s.&quot;    Rates on conventional 30-year fixed-rate home mortgages, now about 10 1/2%, will jump to about 11% by midyear and 11 1/2% by year's end, according to Mr. Kellner. As recently as March 26, the average conventional 30-year mortgage rate was only 9.09%, according to HSH Associates of Riverdale, N.J.    Federal Reserve officials face a dilemma. If they raise rates in an effort to calm inflation jitters, they could send the economy into a tailspin. But if they do nothing, rates might surge anyway, because of growing nervousness about inflation, and undermine the Fed's credibility among investors as an inflation-fighter.    The latest round of prime rate increases, initiated by Chase Manhattan Bank, was the third in the past seven weeks and brought the rate to its highest level since last summer. The two previous boosts were led by Citibank.    Prime rate increases draw widespread attention because the prime is used by banks as a base rate on loans to many small and medium-size businesses as well as on a growing number of consumer loans, including the highly popular home-equity loans.    But the prime rate is of little concern to the nation's biggest companies. Banks are willing to offer these large corporate customers much lower rates in an effort to keep them from turning to alternate sources of credit, such as the commercial paper market.    Bankers have argued that all their prime rate increases were caused by increases in their own borrowing costs. But some analysts contend other factors have played supporting roles. They say one reason for the speed of the prime rate increases is that banks are especially eager to spruce up their profit margins and strengthen their financial structure because of concern about their huge loans to Latin American nations such as Brazil.    Nonetheless, criticism of banks has waned somewhat as other interest rates have surged in the past few weeks. For example, the federal funds rate Friday averaged 6.89% after averaging 6.75% in the week ended Wednesday. Early this year, the rate on funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged just slightly over 6%.    &quot;Greed has something to do with it (the latest prime rate increases), but it's not as though banks are the only ones raising interest rates out there today,&quot; said Edward Yardeni, chief economist of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. &quot;Many bond investors have concluded inflationary pressures are reemerging in the economy. So banks are justified in raising their rates to the extent that bond investors are demanding higher returns for lending money.&quot;    Still, skepticism about banks persists. &quot;Banks seem to move a lot more quickly&quot; in raising the prime rate than they did in previous years, Mr. Yardeni said. &quot;I'm not so sure they will be as quick to lower the prime when their own borrowing costs go back down.&quot;    Whatever the case, the recent surge in borrowing costs casts a dark cloud over the economy. &quot;We are likely to have a recession next year,&quot; contended Mr. Kellner. &quot;If it weren't for the positive impact of the declining trade deficit, I would be ready to ring the gong and call for a recession this year.&quot;    Long-term Treasury bonds were quoted late Friday at about 8.92%. That's an increase of nearly 1 1/2 percentage points from just over 7 1/2% as recently as late March.    Inflation worries have become so deeply embedded that the Federal Reserve may be forced to take unusually bold action soon, some analysts say. &quot;Even though the economy still appears to be growing sluggishly, the Fed may be pushed into a discount rate hike,&quot; said Elliott Platt, a senior vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. The discount rate, which now stands at 5 1/2%, is the rate the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions.    Mr. Platt said the most effective Fed maneuver would be to raise the discount rate a full percentage point -- or to raise the rate half a percentage point at the same time that Japan lowers its rate by the same amount.    Even if the Federal Reserve leaves its credit policy unchanged, rates will rise, predicted Mickey D. Levy, senior vice president and chief economist of Fidelity Bank in Philadelphia. &quot;I see higher inflation and stronger economic growth,&quot; he said. He predicted the prime rate will wind up the year between 8 3/4% and 9%.
