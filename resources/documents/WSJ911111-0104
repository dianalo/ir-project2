Mr. Johnson and his doctor both say that the Los AngelesLakers basketball star contracted the virus throughunprotected heterosexual sex. His gallant public disclosurerenews the focus upon the AIDS epidemic among heterosexuals.And he may prove a spectacular health educator, as evidencedon Friday's Arsenio Hall Show, where he urged safe sex andcondom use.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;To heterosexuals, AIDS is coming fast,&quot; he said. &quot;We haveto prepare for it.&quot;   In reality, heterosexual AIDS didn't explode as tabloidnewspapers once warned. It wasn't a volcano, but rather aniceberg. &quot;Slowly, glacially, this epidemic is becoming moreheterosexual, as it is in Africa,&quot; says one federalscientist. &quot;Until now, the developed world {with its largelygay AIDS epidemic} was an anomaly, but now heterosexuals arethe big growth area here too.&quot;   Today, nearly 11,000 reported cases of acquired immunedeficiency syndrome -- or almost 6% of the 192,406 totaladult caseload -- arose from heterosexual contact, accordingto the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Unlike the levelingof homosexual cases, heterosexual incidence is climbing.   &quot;In 1990, there was a 40% increase in heterosexual cases,versus a 12% increase in AIDS cases overall,&quot; says JamesCurran, head of the CDC's AIDS activities. &quot;Three thousandsuch cases were reported in the last 12 months alone, aboutthe same number as the total AIDS cases in 1984,&quot; the yearthe virus was identified.   And that growth may be more striking among the cases ofhuman immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, infection. WilliamBlattner, chief of viral epidemiology at the National CancerInstitute, says that out of an estimated one millionAmericans infected, heterosexuals may number 8% or 9% --indicating the bulge in AIDS cases yet to come.   While AIDS sleuths strive to count patients and estimatethe infected -- all part of the job of tracking the size,speed and direction of the AIDS epidemic -- they say this isbecoming more difficult. From once-clearly identified riskgroups, the virus is extending its reach outward.   &quot;What's happening is we are in fact seeing moreheterosexual transmission from partners who aren't from anyidentified risk group,&quot; says Nancy Padian, an epidemiologistat the University of California at San Francisco. Initially,heterosexuals may have contracted HIV from partners who werebisexual or who had used intravenous drugs. But as the virusgets passed on, the link with labeled &quot;risk groups&quot; becomesblurred.   &quot;That's how sexually-transmitted diseases work: You seedan epidemic in a core group and then it emanates out. There'sa mixing. We don't live in a closed society.&quot; She adds: &quot;Youmay not know one of your partners is at risk.&quot;   The very notion of risk groups -- and its baggage oflabels and social stigma -- creates a delicate bind forpublic health officials. On one hand, such labels givedoctors an important tool of analysis; on the other hand,they help fuel public denial.   &quot;Mr. Johnson's case raises anew the importance ofmonitoring rates of infections in populations,&quot; says Dr.Blattner of NCI. &quot;The U.S. is made up of many differentpopulations, each with a diversity of potential routes ofexposure.&quot; Inevitably the public seizes on labels as a meansto assess their personal risk, to better understand what theyhave to fear.   But this also can backfire. &quot;People often use labels as away of denying potential risk. It's really the behaviors ofunsafe or unprotected sex that are important,&quot; rather thanthe labels, Dr. Blattner adds. &quot;I don't think in manyrespects that it's any of our business how {Magic Johnson}became infected.&quot;   &quot;Magic Johnson makes people realize anyone can get it.Anyone can also avoid it,&quot; says CDC's Dr. Curran. &quot;There's aripping away of denial, irrespective of how he got it.&quot;   Privately, however, some public health officials say AIDSeducation and change in behavior already has been sosuccessful in the gay community that Mr. Johnson's mostimportant role may be in ministering to straight, sexuallyactive singles. That is the group he most needs to reach,they say. If the tabloids plunder his privacy, or promoterumors about bisexuality in the sports world, they worry thatit could hurt his mission.   &quot;To the extent a black kid in Dayton understands {AIDS},it's more important if Magic Johnson got it heterosexuallythan {if he got it} bisexually,&quot; says a physician whorequested anonymity. &quot;That's unfortunate, but it's true.&quot;   However, some AIDS activists say speculation about how thevirus was acquired diverts energy from real goal: curingAIDS.   &quot;I'm kind of upset about it,&quot; says Larry Kramer,playwright and founder of the AIDS activist group Act-Up.   &quot;This guy is too beloved. It's foolish to hypothesize{about what the tabloids might do}. As long as he'scourageous, we'll run with that ball as far as we can. I'd beglad if we could stop talking about risk categories. We'vegot a plague going on here.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
