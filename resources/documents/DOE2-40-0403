Movement forregulation of production and consumption of the flon is getting strongerin recent a few years. The author maintains that the greenhouse effectis more serious. He explains the nature of flon problem. He points outthat the name 'flon' is misleading, and proposes 'fluorine based functionalgas or liquid' instead. The reason for use of the fluoreocarbon basedgas is explained and data is shown for two alternative faluorocarbon-basedcompounds with and without chlorine that do not break down the ozonein the stratosphere.
