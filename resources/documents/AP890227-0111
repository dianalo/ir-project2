The report says last year's delivery of 19,000 tons of equipmentcame during 68 ship visits to Nicaraguan ports, an average of aboutone every six days.   The unclassified analysis, compiled by intelligence agencies,said the peak year for Soviet arms shipments was 1986 when theSandinistas received $550 million worth of equipment.   That was the last year Congress approved military aid for theNicaraguan Contras.   A year ago, Congress suspended military aid to the Contras, andas the months passed, Reagan administration officials expressed deepdisappointment that the Soviets did not reciprocate by cutting backon weapons shipments to the Sandinistas.   The aid suspension was quickly followed by an interim cease-firebetween the Sandinistas and the Contras in late March. Subsequently,about 11,000 Contras fled to camps in Honduras along the borderwhere the rebels are sustained by a U.S. humanitarian aid program.   The Sandinistas have contended that continued Soviet armsshipments were needed in the event the United States decided toresume military aid to the Contras.   The Kremlin has said that it would suspend arms deliveries to theSandinistas as part of an overall ban on outside arms shipments toCentral America, but the United States has shown no interest in thatproposal.   The $515 million listed for 1988 is described in the report as apreliminary estimate which is subject to revision as new data becomeavailable. U.S. officials have estimated Soviet economic aid toNicaragua at about $500 million annually.   A U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said estimatesof military aid were somewhat easier to make last year because alack of storage space forced the Sandinistas to leave much of theequipment out in the open where it could be photographed by U.S.intelligence agencies.   The United States and the Soviet Union have shown an ability towork together on several regional conflicts, including Afghanistan,Angola-Namibia and the Iran-Iraq war.   But the superpowers remain deeply divided over Nicaragua. TheUnited States looks on the continuing Soviet arms deliveries as themost troubling aspect of Soviet involvement in that area.   Former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams said lastmonth before leaving office that economic decline in Nicaragua hasleft the Sandinista government somewhat weaker but that the weaponsdeliveries have made it stronger militarily.   The report said that the Sandinista army, including ``active dutyand mobilized militia-reserves,'' totaled 80,000 at the start of1989, the same figure as a year earlier.   The Sandinista inventory also included 150 tanks, 250 otherarmored vehicles, 32 fixed-wing aircraft, 50 helicopters and sixairfields, the report said.   The type of equipment received by the Sandinistas in 1988 was notspecified in the report.</TEXT></DOC>
