Most of the calls weren't nice. Investors were furious that they were getting only $700 of stock for each $10,000 they had invested -- not including the tax benefits they had received. They threatened lawsuits, grumbled about promises unfulfilled and wailed about brokers who may have oversold the partnerships' tax benefits and profit potential.    So goes another crash-landing in the battered limited partnership business. Just as hundreds of the once-popular partnerships in oil and gas and real estate have failed in the past few years, now cattle partnerships are reaching the end of their lifespans and exposing their financial woes.    &quot;I don't sell any more limited partnerships and never will again,&quot; vows Richard Bouckhout, a broker with Sun American Securities in Phoenix. &quot;The risk is so outrageous.&quot; Mr. Bouckhout and about 60 of his customers purchased Granada units.    Cattle-feeding partnerships such as Granada's were once all the rage, providing investors with hefty tax write-offs and, occasionally, a nice profit, although that was a secondary consideration. When it organized the partnerships in the 1970s, Granada thought it had devised a profitable vehicle both for itself and for investors. Investors seemed to agree. Some 20,000 of them poured $228 million into Integrated Cattle Systems V and Granada 1 through Granada 5.    Today, however, those six partnerships have a net book value of just $50 million. The rest of the money disappeared as administrative fees, spending for research and losses on cattle feeding and the sale of breeding cattle, Granada says.    For Granada, the cattle-feeding partnerships were a godsend, providing funding then unavailable from banks, says David Eller, who owns Granada with his brother James. &quot;Basically, they were financing all the business of {Granada} with limited partnerships,&quot; says Spencer Jeffries, president of Partnership Profiles Inc., a Dallas firm that tracks limited partnerships.    Thanks to the partnerships, Granada was able to pioneer embryo transfer technology for cattle. It developed the first successful cattle-cloning technique, which could lead to the production of more uniform, high-quality beef for packers. It has gathered one of the largest herds of purebred cattle in the world and acquired a number of meat production companies. In 1988, the company generated $1 billion in revenue and a profit of about $2 million.    But Granada's limited partners weren't so lucky. As a prolonged cattle industry slump set in through the 1980s, many cattle-feeding partnerships -- including Granada's -- started racking up persistent losses. Indeed, the slump drove many of those partnerships and their sponsors out of the cattle business, even before the tax-law changes in 1986 curbed the partnerships' value as tax shelters. And unlike real estate partnerships, which at least ended up owning apartments and office buildings, cattle partnerships wound up with few, if any, assets to cushion the blow. The cattle were sold at a loss, draining equity.    Granada's partnerships took another hit as well. As an extra inducement to investors, Granada shuffled the ownership of the cattle fed by the partnerships in such a way that, Granada's tax experts reasoned, any profits from partnership operations could be treated and taxed as capital gains, rather than ordinary income.    But in 1988 audits of Granada 2 and Granada 3, the Internal Revenue Service ruled that the partnership proceeds were ordinary income, thus increasing investors' tax liability. The ruling came as a surprise, Granada officials say, because the IRS had approved capital-gains treatment on Granada's previous partnerships. In explaining its reversal of previous rulings, the IRS told the company the transactions appeared to be simply an attempt to avoid taxes, instead of serving a legitimate business purpose.    It came as even more of a surprise to investors, who received tax bills for Granada 3 and Granada 4 just a couple of weeks ago. A Dallas salesman who sank $55,000 into a Granada partnership says the IRS billed him for $40,000, the amount he had written off in 1985. &quot;And I thought I was wired into the best deal money could buy,&quot; he says sadly.    The prospectuses for each partnership advised investors to seek advice on the tax consequences. Unfortunately, many investors, it appears, relied on their brokers' assurances that the tax benefits would pass IRS muster.    Granada defends its record as a sponsor of partnerships, arguing that they were sold as tax shelters, not as money-making ventures. Only recently, Mr. Eller says, did he discover that some brokers &quot;oversold&quot; the partnerships, orally promising two-to-one and three-to-one returns on equity. When investors &quot;came charging through our doors, we found out&quot; how the partnerships were sold, he says. The partnerships were sold by hundreds of brokers at several large and small brokerage houses.    It is unclear, however, who did the overselling. Mr. Bouckhout, the Phoenix broker, says that before he invested in and sold the Granada partnerships he was assured by company executives that earlier partnerships were profitable.    &quot;The promises made by those folks {at Granada} and the agents selling for them were totally different from what this turned out to be,&quot; says Franklin Clark, a North Carolina doctor who invested $320,000 in Granada 2 and additional sums in other partnerships.    Granada's Mr. Eller says that four of the company's six partnerships gave investors positive returns after counting tax write-offs, even after the IRS ruling, although he isn't bragging about the figures. Generally, Granada investors in the 50% tax bracket were able to amass enough write-offs to offset their original investment, says Kevin Gannon, Granada's vice president for corporate finance. And with the stock Granada plans to distribute, returns on those partnerships over their seven-year life will range from 2.8% annually to 10.3% annually, he estimates.    The two new publicly traded companies being offered to investors have more potential than investors think, Granada officials say. Though limited partners will receive only $700 in stock for each $10,000 invested, that valuation doesn't reflect the value of Granada's research or its patents, which will be held largely by the new corporations, Mr. Eller says.    Investors may still consider Granada's offering a pittance. But Mr. Eller points out that it is more than the company was obligated to do. According to the partnerships' prospectuses, Granada could simply liquidate, and the limited partners would get virtually nothing. Granada doesn't need investor approval to invoke its plan. Unless the SEC rejects the plan or investors get a court-ordered injunction, the stock will be distributed this fall. </TEXT></DOC>
