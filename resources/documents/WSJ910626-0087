Her perception thatBJP is an orthodox and anti-multinational party is untrue,for it has clearly expressed its desire to get government offthe backs of the people and accelerate privatization inselected sectors of the economy. Ms. Rosett also overlooksthe fact that the threats to India's stability and prosperityare in all likelihood posed by Muslim fundamentalism,nuclear-weapons development in Pakistan, dictatorships inBurma and Bangladesh, ethnic unrest in Sri Lanka, etc., andnot by India's identity with Hindu thought or the disarmingof Kashmiri militants or Punjab terrorists. A stronger Indiawill alleviate the problem of the arms race in that area andserve as an engine of growth.   Besides, India has since its independence remained ademocracy, unlike neighboring Pakistan or China. Therefore,any Western misgiving or apprehension about either BJP orIndia's nationalistic approach, which is similar in many waysto that of France, are completely unfounded. On the contrary,India deserves help and cooperation from the U.S., theworld's richest democracy, by way of encouragingprivate-sector participation in capital-intensive industriessuch as telecommunications, power generation and the buildingof highways.</LP><TEXT>   Sreeman Kota   New York   ---   Ms. Rosett writes: &quot;Only seven years ago Rajiv's mother,Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was killed by two of her Sikhbodyguards -- a murder that set off Hindu-Muslim riots inwhich thousands died.&quot; In fact, Indira Gandhi's assassinationresulted in violence perpetrated by Hindus against Sikhs, notMuslims, in which more than 3,000 Sikhs died. Furthermore,this violence did not consist of street &quot;riots&quot; between thetwo communities, but involved the use of electoral rolls byCongress (I) party members to identify Sikh households. Theseresidences were then systematically set on fire andvandalized, the men killed and the women raped by hoodlumspaid by the Congress (I) party and party members themselves.In-depth documentation of this event exists in the literatureon Indian politics.   Furthermore, another article on May 22 regarding theassassination attributes the liberalization of the economythat took place over the past few years to Rajiv Gandhi.However, the reforms implemented between 1984 and 1989 werelargely the work of V.P. Singh, finance minister under RajivGandhi, who subsequently had to resign precisely because hisinvestigations of corrupt business practices were going toofar for the comfort of his party members. Therefore, it isinaccurate to present Rajiv Gandhi as a politician who stoodfor economic liberalization in contrast to V.P. Singh.   I would argue that Hindu fundamentalism has surged thepast few years in India because of the inability of politicalparties to secure electoral support by responding to therational economic demands of the people. Therefore, theparties have resorted to provoking violence among religiousand ethnic minorities in order to present themselves as theprotectors of both Hinduism and national unity from Sikh andMuslim terrorism in an attempt to capture the Hindu majorityvote.
