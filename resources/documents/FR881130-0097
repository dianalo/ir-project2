Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval</ITAG>As stated above, the proposed amendment of the NYSE Constitution is intendedto reinsert a conflict of interest provision into the Exchange's Constitution.The Conflict of interest provision that the Exchange is currently operatingunder was contained in Article III, section 2, of the previous NYSE Constitution.That provision states that ``no person shall participate in the adjudicationof any matter in which he is personally interested.'' \2\<NOTE/> The NYSE sought to eliminate that provision in connectionwith the proposed re-organized and redrafted NYSE Constitution that wassubmitted for Commission review in December of 1985.\3\<NOTE/> The Commission approved the proposed new NYSE Constitution\4\<NOTE/> but took no action on that portion of the proposal that wouldhave eliminated the conflict of interest clause from the Constitution.\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ We note that the proposed provision would replace ``noperson'' with ``no Directors.'' <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See </T3>File No. SR-NYSE-85-47. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22959, February 28,1986, 51 FR 8060. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Since the Commission did not approve its elimination,the conflict of interest provision from the previous NYSE Constitutionremains in effect. The NYSE agreed with the Commission that a conflict of interest provisionsshould be reinserted in the NYSE Constitution.\6\<NOTE/> Subsequently, the Exchange submitted the instant proposalas well as a proposed rule change that would adopt conflict of interestlanguage applying to all persons involved in a NYSE adjudication.\7\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Telephone conversation between Brandon Becker, AssistantDirector, Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission,and James E. Buck, Secretary, NYSE, on February 24, 1986. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>See </T3>note 1, <T3>supra. </T3>The Commission has closely reviewed the proposed amendment to the NYSEConstitution and believes that it is consistent with the requirements ofthe Act and that, accordingly, it should be approved. In particular, theCommission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section6(b)(7) of the Act which requires that the rules of an exchange providea fair procedure for the disciplining of members and persons associatedwith members, in that the proposal will add a conflict of interest provisionto the NYSE Constitution that will prohibit members of the Exchange's BoardDirectors from participating in the adjudication of any matter in whichthey have a personal interest.\8\<NOTE/> The Commission also notes that its approval of this proposedamendment to the NYSE Constitution is concurrent with Commission approvalof a proposed rule change that will add to NYSE Rule 22 parallel conflictof interest language that will extend this prohibition to all other personsinvolved in an adjudication, including all members, officers, and employeesof the Exchange.\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ In its order approving the proposed redrafted and reorganizedNYSE Constitution, the Commission states that section 6(b)(7) of the Actmakes it essential that a conflict of interest provision be present inthe NYSE Constitution. <T3>See </T3>note 4, <T3>supra. </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ <T3>See </T3>note 1, <T3>supra. </T3>The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule changeprior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filingthereof so that a conflict of interest provision can be promptly reinsertedinto the revised NYSE Constitution. As noted previously, the Commissionbelieves that it is essential that a conflict of interest provision helpingto ensure fairness in NYSE adjudications be present in the NYSE Constitution.While the conflict of interest provision from the prior Constitution hasremained in effect since adoption of the Exchange's revised Constitution,adoption of the proposed amendment will reinsert an appropriate conflictof interest provision into the revised NYSE Constitution. In addition,the adoption of this amendment adding a conflict of interest provisionto the revised NYSE Constitution will occur at the same time as Commissionapproval of a proposed NYSE rule that will apply the same conflict of intereststandard to all other members, officers, and employees of the Exchange.It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, thatthe proposed rule change be, and hereby is, approved. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegatedauthority.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 22, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
