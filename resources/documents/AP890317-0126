According to Freddie Mac's weekly national survey, this week'saverage for fixed-rate mortgages was up from 10.86 percent last weekto the highest level since rates averaged 11.36 percent in the weekending Oct. 23, 1987.   On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, meanwhile, lenders wereasking an average initial rate of 9.02 percent this week, thehighest since they hit 9.09 percent on Jan. 17, 1986. The ARM ratewas up from 8.93 percent last week.   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been nudging up interestrates in an effort to restrain economic growth and thus keepinflation in check.   Housing construction hit a post-recession peak in 1986 and hasbeen sliding since then, although most economists say the industryremains healthy as it weathers a controlled slowdown.   Analysts are forecasting a further decline in the housing marketthis year as the higher interest rates start to pinch and theeconomy begins to cool down.   Housing construction was down 11.4 percent in February, thegovernment reported on Thursday, with analysts attributing thedecline in part to an expected fallback after a warm-weather surgein January but also to the bite of rising interest rates.   ``We're looking for a modest decline of housing market activity,due not only to somewhat higher mortgage rates but also due to thefact that the economy is slowing,'' said economist Richard Peach ofthe Mortgage Bankers Association.   Peach said the effects of higher interest rates on the housingmarket so far have been minor, but are likely to increase in futuremonths.   Economist Michael Sumichrast, who publishes a newsletter on thehousing industry, maintained the Fed's tight money policy alreadywas having a negative impact on construction and sales.   ``There has been an outcry of frustration about the FederalReserve Board tightening up,'' he said. ``We are going to get into arecession on housing unless the Fed eases up.''   The rise in adjustable-rate mortgages is particularly troubling,since many homebuyers have relied on the lower initial rates offeredwith ARMs to break into the housing market, Sumichrast said.</TEXT></DOC>
