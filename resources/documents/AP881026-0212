Dr. Mary Jo O'Sullivan, a member of an ACOG panel that developedthe guidelines, said a pregnant women who has had an earlier childby Caesarean section ``should be encouraged to attempt labor in hercurrent pregnancy'' instead of routinely undergoing a secondsurgical delivery.

The impact of these buyouts _ which rely largely on borrowedfunds _ also could multiply if the U.S. economy enters a recession,and the companies are unable to generate the cash flow or assetsales needed to raise money for their debt payments, according tolabor economists and consultants.
