<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-28-0278 </DOCNO><TEXT>Because the time resolution requirements of experiments at the NevadaTest Site exceed the capabilities of traditional electrical analog cable,fiber optic analog diagnostics systems have become attractive. A numberof different instrumentation systems are possible using commerciallyavailable laser-diode transmitters. In addition, the fiber optic systemsdesigner has a choice of receivers, operating wavelengths, and fibertypes. We will compare the system performance of 810-nm systems withboth single-mode and multimodel fiber as well as 1300-nm single-modefiber systems with both a photodiode oscilloscope and a laser-diode streak-camerareceiver. 3 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
