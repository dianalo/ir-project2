The contract, issued to General Dynamics Land Systems Inc., continues the Pentagon's plan for acquiring the new battle tank as part of a larger modernization program for the Army.    Despite deep cuts in the defense budget recently, the M-1 seems guaranteed to generate heavy year-to-year spending. Although the Pentagon requested funds for 600 M-1 tanks for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, Congress increased the purchase to 720.    In other awards yesterday, Mobil Oil Corp. received a $56.9 million Defense Logistics Agency contract for jet fuel, fuel oil and gasoline; Day andamp; Zimmermann Inc. got a $31.4 million Army contract to produce munitions; and TRW Inc. was issued a $14.8 million Air Force contract for Minuteman missile-engineering services. </TEXT></DOC>
