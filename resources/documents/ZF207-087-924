 The results were astounding.andM;Before a new Mips chip set series finds its way into systems built by othermanufacturers, it first goes into one of Mips' own computer systems.andP;  Evennow, Mips' Unix systems deliver unprecedented raw CPU performance at anexcellent price.andM;The Mips M/120-5 uses the same R2000 RISC chip set that DEC selected for theDECstation 3100.andP;  The M/120-5 is a powerful, compact, multiuser system thatruns RISC/os, a port of ATandamp;T's Unix System V release 3 with many BerkeleyUnix (BSD) features such as the BSD fast file system, TCP/IP networking andSun Microsystems' Network File System (NFS).andM;The M/120-5 is contained in an IBM PC AT-size deskside unit and comesstandard with an advanced Micro Devices 7990 Ethernet network interface(thick-wire only, at the present time), an internal 5-1/4-inch full-height328MB or 156MB SCSI disk drive and an internal 5-1/4-inch half-height QIC-120SCSI tape drive.andM;A standard SCSI interface is included (all disk and tapes are served by theSCSI bus), and the M/120-5 also includes a four-slot PC AT bus for otherdevices and options.andM;IT'S IN THE CHIPSandM;The hearet of the M/120-5 is the R2000 chip set, Mips' first foray into RISCcomputing.andM;Derived from work at Stanford University, Mips' RISC architecture adheresquite strictly to the &quot;traditional&quot; principles of RISC technology.andM;The R2000 uses no microcoded instructions, such as are found in complexinstruction set machines like the VAX.andP;  With the exception of multiply anddivide operations, all non-floating-point operations can complete in a singlemachine cycle.andM;Further, the five discrete steps invovled in an instruction (fetching theinstruction, reading operands from registers, performing the instructionitself, accessing the data cache and writing the results back to memory) canbe overlapped, allowing the R2000 to yield execution rates approaching oneinstruction per cycle.andM;The R2000 chip set consists of five components: the R2000 RISC processoritself, the optional R2010 floating-point processor (which can be left out ofsome M/120 configurations), the instruction cache, the data cache and theR2020 write buffers.andM;The R2000 CPU implements only 155 instructions (including 56 floating-pointoperations and four co-processor instructions related to virtual memorymanagement), as opposed to the 320 instructions in the VAX instruction set.andM;The CPU includes 32 32-bit general registers and two 32-bit special registers(for results of multiply and divide operations).andM;TEN LITTLE ENDIANSandM;The architecture of the R2000 also allows the &quot;big-endian&quot; or &quot;little-endian&quot;data storage; that is, systems in which the most significant bits in a dataword are either first or last.andP;  The M/120-5 (like Motorola's 68000-serieschips and IBM's 370 architecture) uses big-endian storage; bit or byte 0 isthe most significant.andP;  Conversely, VAXes and IBM PCs are little-endian, wherebit or byte 0 is the least significant.andM;So, although the new DECstation 3100 uses the same R2000 processor as theM/120-5, it uses the same little-endian data format as its VAX cousins.andM;The R2000 CPU can interact with as many as four co-processors.andP;  Two of theco-processor interfaces are defined, and the remaining two are reserved byMips for future use.andP;  The first co-processor is the system controlco-processor, which is on the R2000 chip itself.andP;  It handles the virtualmemory and exception-handling functions required by the computer.andP;  Primarily,it employs a translation lookaside buffer to translate the CPU's virtualmemory addresses into physical addresses.andM;The operation of the second co-processor, the R2010 floating-point unit,adheres to the ANSI/IEEE 754-1985 standard for binary floating-pointarithmetic.andP;  The R2010 operates completely in parallel with the CPU and,according to Mips officials, completes most floating-point arithmeticoperations in a single CPU cycle.andM;The R2010 has 16 64-bit registers that can hold single- and double-precisionoperands or results; if an R2010 is not present, any reference to theseregisters results in an exception condition for the R2000, which the RISC/osoperating system responds to by emulating the R2010 to perform the requestedfloating-point operation.andM;The R2000 uses separate, relatively large 64KB instruction and data caches toreduce required accesses to main memory, which take much longer to completeand could slow down the operation of the CPU.andM;This possible bottleneck is also addressed by the R2020 write buffers.andO;Rather than writing data directly to main memory, the CPU writes data tothese buffers and then can continue with other processing.andP;  The write buffersthen complete the write to main memory.andP;  These buffers are four words deep;if the CPU attempts a fifth write to the buffers before they have written tomain memory, it will have to wait for them.andM;Main memory for the M/120-5 resides on a motherboard with the CPU subsystem(Fig.andP;  1) and is connected to it through the M bus, a synchronous bus thatMips claims support a peak bandwidth of 11MB per second for reads and 16MBper second for writes.andP;  As much as 48MB of memory can be supported.andM;TAKE THE I BUSandM;The CPU and memory are connected to the outside world through the I bus, onwhich reside the SCSI interface, AT bus interface, Ethernet interface andserial I/O interface.andM;The SCSI interface supports as many as seven devices and is used for all diskand tape devices.andP;  It supports both asynchronous and synchronous transfersand has a peak transfer rate of 4MB per second in synchronous mode.andM;The SCSI interface supports one internal disk drive and one internal tapedrive (both standard features on the M/120-5).andM;A SCSI connector is located on the rear of the M/120-5's system cabinet,which allows the SCSI bus to be extented to other devices (Fig.andP;  2).andM;Such additional devices are typically enclosed in an expansion cabinet, whichhas the same physical dimensions as the M/120-5 system cabinet and includes a400-watt power supply.andM;Like many of the small 80386-based Unix systems on the market today, theM/120-5 has an IBM PC AT bus interface supports as many as four standard ATslave and master cards.andP;  (A slave card cannot access the system main memorydirectly; a master card can.)andM;Although AT cards generally are supplied with device driver software for theMS-DOS, OS/2 or Xenix operating systems, Mips officials advise that thesedrivers will usually have to be modified or completely rewritten to work withthe R2000 processor and RISC/os.andP;  The M/120-5 Technical Reference manualincludes a chapter devoted to this subject and the C source-code listing of asample device driver.andM;The interface also offers byte-swapping for AT bus access, because theM/120-5's ordering of bits within a word is reversed from that of the IBMPC's.andM;The serial I/O interface includes four RS-232-C serial ports, only two ofwhich support full modem control.andM;Like most Unix implementations in existence today, RISC/os continues toevolve toward a converged ATandamp;T/BSD Unix.andP;  RISC/os version 4, which is due outby midyear, should complete the merger of BSD features with the System Vbase.andM;In most cases, Mips has added features or functionality from BSD to its UnixSystem V; in a few cases, System V items have been replaced by BSD features.andO;RISD/os supports either the System V &quot;1K&quot; file system or the Berkeley fastfile system, but support for the System V file system will be removed inRISC/os version 4.andM;RISC/os supports TCP/IP for network operations and NFS for network fileaccess, rather than the System V Remote File Systems (RFS).andP;  RISC/os supportsthe Berkeley sendmail facility as well as the uucp (Unix-Unix Copy) protocol.andM;OPEN THE WINDOWandM;Although Mips does not currently have any graphics workstations, support forX Window System release 11 version 2 will be available shortly (althoughwhether it will be bundled with the operating system or will be a layeredproduct has yet to be determined).andP;  This support will allow any RISC/osmachine to act as a client for an X windows display server.andP;  Basically, thisprovides the Xlib routines that are required for the X windows client.andM;We had little difficulty with the management of th eM/120-5 while we had itfor review.andP;  During that time, we installed two additional disk drives andupgraded the system from RISC/os version 3.0 to 3.10 without any problems.andM;A RISC/os user has the choice of the Bourne or C shells as a commandinterface.andP;  The C shell is particularly easy to use because of theavailability of command line editing similar to that used in DCL.andP;  A user mayrecall previous command lines, edit them and resubmit submit them forexecution.andM;The command keys used are based on the Emacs editor key definitions but canbe redefined to any control keys--although only single-character control keyscan be used, so the keypad or function keys cannot be used.andM;In addition to the basic editing capabilities, such as inserting and deletingcharacters or words, searching for strings in the history list, or the like,the command line editing also allows filename completion: Pressing the Escapekey twice will cause the shell to attempt to finish the current word as afilename in the current directory.andP;  If no single match is found, a directorylisting of the possible matches is produced.andM;Like most versions of Unix, RISC/os comes with C compiler; Fortran, Pascal,Cobol, Ada and PL/1 compilers are also available.andP;  We used the C and Fortrancompilers extensively without any problems.andP;  Both support three levels ofoptimization.andM;RISC/os includes the pixie profiling tool to assist in efficient programdevelopment.andM;Similar to DEC's separately licensed PCA (Performance Coverage Analyzer),pixie lets programmers collect a substantial amount of information regardingthe performance characteristics of their programs.andM;The pixie tool reports how many times each subroutine or line of a programwas executed and how much actual time was spent in that subroutine or line.andM;Documentation accompanying the M/120-5 extends to both ends of the spectrum.andM;The larger Programmer's Reference Manual, System Administrator's ReferenceManual and USer's Reference Manual are the standard man pages found with mostUnix systems (similar to the small binders that come with DEC's Ultrix), withthe appropriate editing for items specific to RISC/os.andM;As any Unix neophyte knows, the man pages can often lead not to enlightenmentbut to even more confusion, and Mips' are no exception.andM;They do, luckily, include (in addition to the table of contents) a &quot;permutedindex,&quot; which is essentially a table of contents and an index rollled intoone.andP;  The permuted index makes it quite easy to locate the several sectionsof a manual that may be needed to answer a question.andM;The System's Programmer's Guide, Languages Programmer's Guide and AssemblyLanguage Programmer's Guide, while shorter than the manuals, are excellentlywritten and produced, and they proved to be superb sources of information.andM;The performance of the M/120-5 is, quite simply, stunning.andP;  It turned in ahealthy 13.72 MicroVAX II units of processing (MVUPs) on DR Labs' CPU 2Fortran benchmark suite, which measures a system's power at tackling typicalscientific applications (Fig.andP;  3).andM;This performance placed the M/120-5 far beyond the single-CPU performance ofany DEC machine and in good stead against such superminis as the Alliant FX/8and the Apollo DN10010 Personal Supercomputer.andM;To examine how the M/120-5 performs for other applications, we installedversion 5.0 of the Ingres relational database system from RelationalTechnology.andP;  To handle the 80,000-record subscriber database that is used inDR Labs' database benchmarks, we added an expansion cabinet and twoadditional 328MB disk drives.andM;Ingres was installed easily although we did have to reconfigure the RISC/oskernel to allow additional shared memory so that we could run a fullcomplement of 40 simultaneous Ingres users.andM;The results are exceptional; the M/120-5 performed DR Labs' Ingres databasebenchmarks on the average 17 times faster than did a MicroVAX II (Fig.andP;  4).andO;This performance advantage was sustained across different types of SQLstatements.andM;Better yet, the M/120-5 realized this improved performance in DR Labs'multiuser Ingres test as well.andP;  We loaded the M/120-5 with a succession ofmultiple shell scripts, each running a variation of several Ingres SQLoperations.andP;  As the number of users increased, the M/120-5's performancedegraded more slowly than did the CISC-based MicroVAX II's (Fig.andP;  5).andM;These results indicate that the M/120-5 would be well-suited for use as amultiuser compute or database server on a network and is not just asingle-user workstation niche product.andM;MANY SHAPES AND SIZESandM;The M/120-5 is available in many standard configurations, and, if none ofthese configurations fits the prospective user's needs, Mips will let buyerspiece them together individually.andM;The basic configuration of an M/120-5--with 8MB of memory, a 328MB hard disk,a 120MB cartridge tape drive, an Ethernet controller, four serial ports,RISC/os software and documentation--is priced at $30,500.andP;  Each additional8MB of memory is $7,300, and each additional 328MB disk drive is $4,000.andM;The expansion cabinet for additional SCSI devices is priced at $2,900.andP;  Inaddition, Mips offers a Macintosh server configuration, which adds Mips'uShare AppleTalk software for 16 Mac users and two AppleTalk AT buscontrollers, for $44,500.andM;A RISC/os license is for an unlimited number of users.andP;  Other languagecompilers range from $1,000 for Fortran to $8,000 for Ada.andP;  The X WindowSystem client software is priced at $150.andM;The Mips M/120-5 is a robust system that delivers excellent performance on avariety of DR Labs' benchmarks and will prove to be a pleasure for any Unixuser to use.andP;  Those sites requiring a small, high-powered, low-cost multiuserUnix system would do well to give the M/120-5 serious thought, for it has seta new standard in such systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
