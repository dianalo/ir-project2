The result: a bonanza for airlines but mounting pressure on strained ground facilities.    Japan is emerging as the hub of one of the world's fastest-growing travel regions. More than eight million Japanese are expected to vacation abroad this year.    &quot;There's a tremendous upward potential in this market that is going to sustain trans-Pacific growth at a rapid pace . . . well into the mid-1990s and as we move into the turn of the century,&quot; says David Ruch, director of Pacific marketing and sales for Northwest Airlines Inc., a unit of NWA Inc. of St. Paul, Minn.    The Olympic Games in South Korea boosted growth in the regional-airline market as Japanese make up the largest body of tourists heading for nearby Seoul.    A Japan Air Lines spokesman says the airline's normal schedule of 58 flights a week from various Japanese cities to South Korea will be boosted to 170.    Air travel world-wide grew by 13% in 1987, according to the 170-airline International Air Transport Association.    The Geneva-based organization predicts Asia will lead world expansion: trans-Pacific travel alone is expected to grow 11% annually into the mid-1990s, in tune with the fast economic growth of Japan and other countries in the region.    &quot;As long as the yen stays around the current level or strengthens, we can expect long-term growth in the airline market in Japan,&quot; says Scott Foster, a transportation analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.'s Merrill Lynch Securities unit in Tokyo.    Trans-Pacific flights out of the new Tokyo International Airport at Narita, Japan's main international gateway, rose 17% in 1987 compared with 1986. Those to Australia and New Zealand jumped more than 31% and to southeast Asia by 12%, say aviation authority officials.    The main catalysts for overseas travel are the booming economy, increased leisure time and growing numbers of vacationers who want shopping bargains.    JAL, the largest carrier operating out of Japan, saw its outbound passenger performance grow by 13% in 1987.    Two U.S. carriers, Northwest and United Airlines, a unit of Chicago-based UAL Corp., account for about 50% of the air volume across the Pacific Ocean, followed by JAL with a one-third share.    The remarkable rise in Pacific air travel also has attracted newcomers vying for a market share. All Nippon Airways, relegated until recently to domestic skies, began building up its international network following an inaugural flight to Guam in 1986. It now flies to several U.S. destinations. The other domestic carrier, Japan Air System Co., inaugurated its first overseas flight to Seoul in July and is gearing up for other Pacific destinations.    On the U.S. side, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, a unit of Dallas-based AMR Corp., have entered the Pacific market over the past two years.    One indication that competition is heating up is a bitter battle between American and United for the prized Seattle-to-Tokyo route. United acquired New York-based Pan Am Corp.'s Pan American World Airways Pacific routes in 1985 for $715 million. In mid-August the U.S. Transportation Department's economic office recommended that United's license on the Seattle route be revoked and awarded to American, despite an earlier court decision to allow United to retain the route.    Katsuya Yonemoto, managing director of American Airlines operations in Japan, said his firm was intent on capturing the Japanese tourist market through routes like Seattle-Tokyo.    &quot;We believe the Pacific, Japan or Asia is one of the most important regions in the world, now and in the future,&quot; he said.    United and American are offering enticing ploys in the form of better service for travelers who select their airline.    Northwest's Mr. Ruch says: &quot;We've got some very significant growth plans overall in the Pacific for ourselves, and United publicly has made it clear that they plan to expand aggressively in the Pacific.&quot;    Along with competition, airlines face hurdles in the form of saturated ground facilities and a shortage of planes.    &quot;Every indication of the growth of this market is such that to some degree we're turning away traffic on many routes and that's true of Northwest and other carriers,&quot; says Mr. Ruch. He blames &quot;equipment restraints, not enough airplanes to really put on the routes.&quot;    The airport at Narita is strained to its limits with a single 4,400-yard runway operating between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. Aviation authorities recently raised the daily limit on arrivals and departures to 330 from 300. Narita plans to add two new runways and a terminal by 1990 but faces bitter opposition from local farmers.    In 1993, Japan's first 24-hour airport, the Kansai International Airport, is schedued to open on an island in a bay off Osaka, 255 miles west of Tokyo, making foreign shores more accessible for outbound Japanese. </TEXT></DOC>
