Among other things, Apple's technology makes it possiblefor a person to tell a Macintosh computer to change the typesize in a document, program a video-recorder or find a namein an electronic telephone directory and then place atelephone call to that person. Essentially, the technologyallows a user to speak aloud any instruction he might give aMacintosh using a keyboard or the pointing device called amouse.</LP><TEXT>   Leading computer researchers hailed Apple's work, sayingit appeared to represent a milestone in the decades-longquest to build personal computers that can carry out spokeninstructions. Apple is the world's second-largest supplier ofpersonal computers.   &quot;As far as I know, this is a first,&quot; said Marvin Minsky, acomputer-science professor at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology and a pioneer in the field of artificialintelligence. Mr. Minsky, along with about 500 other people,witnessed a demonstration of Apple's technology at theTechnology, Entertainment and Design conference here Fridayevening. About 24 hours earlier, Apple conducted a similardemonstration in Tokyo at a trade show.   Several companies, most notably Dragon Systems Inc.,already sell speech-recognizers for personal computers, butthese products require special hardware and a speaker must&quot;train&quot; these systems to respond to his or her voice. Also,these products work well only when speakers say one word at atime, pausing after each one.   On the other hand, Apple's speech-recognizer responded tocontinuous speech, even answering back at times. Mr. Sculleysaid the system works with off-the-shelf Macintosh computerswithout any special hardware such as adigital-signal-processor chip and immediately responds to anew speaker's voice.   It isn't clear how quickly Apple can bring itsspeech-recognizer technology to market or whether the companyhas a significant advantage over rivals. InternationalBusiness Machines Corp., American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.,Nihon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp., NEC Corp. and many othercompanies are trying to solve the same problem. The Japaneseare esepcially interested in building systems that cansimultaneously translate between English and Japanese speech.None of these companies are believed to have duplicatedApple's claim of speaker-independent, continuous-speechrecognition. But sometimes companies keep innovations underwraps until a product is nearly ready.   Mr. Sculley described the demonstration as &quot;a teaser&quot; thatillustrated Apple's progress in building what it has called a&quot;knowledge navigator,&quot; or a pocket-sized computer that canboth respond to commands and answer questions in ordinarylanguage.   Mr. Sculley would not comment on the company's plans forspeech recognition, but he cites Apple's work as evidence ofcontinuing innovation in the field of personal computing. Instatements over the past year -- and especially since Appleannounced a partnership with IBM last July -- Mr. Sculley hasbeen trying to counteract cynicism among buyers of computerswho say personal computer design is stagnating and that theonly thing to be excited about is lower prices.   Observers said that Apple's technology should end up infuture Macintosh computers or in an expected line of&quot;personal electronics,&quot; portable devices that will serve aselectronic notepads or electronic references and include someof the functions of a cellular telephone. The only potentialdrawback is that the speech processor, at least today,requires a top-of-theline 68040 microprocessor from MotorolaInc., which could mean that any speech-capable computerswould sell for more than $5,000.   &quot;It looks like superb work . . . We can't do it in ourlab,&quot; said Wayne Rosing, who heads the advanced research labat Sun Microsystems Inc., a chief rival of Apple.   The key figure behind Apple's speech-recognition researchis a 30-year-old native of Taiwan named Kai-fu Lee. Mr. Leeworked out his basic ideas on speaker independence andcontinuous speech as a graduate student and an assistantprofessor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Hejoined Apple about 18 months ago.   Mr. Lee's appearance in public was somewhat unusual sincecompanies often hide the identity of top researchers on aproject until after it hits the market. At Carnegie Mellon,Mr. Lee built a widely known, continuous speech-recognitionsystem called Sphinx, but it required specially designedmicroprocessors, or &quot;electronic brains.&quot;   In an interview, Mr. Lee said the performance of hisspeech-recongizer does not suffer on a Macintosh equippedwith a 68040 chip. He said he was able to maintainperformance by shrewdly turning some mathematical algorithms,which describe complicated relationships, into Macintoshcomputer code.   &quot;He's done a brilliant job of bolting {the algorithms}into the code,&quot; said Mr. Rosing of Sun.   Mr. Lee, shrugging off compliments, said thespeech-recognizer could stand some improvement. Untutoredspeakers might be confused about how to talk to theircomputer without a better interface, &quot;a developed model thatcues you in on what to say,&quot; he said.   The vocabulary of the system also could be expanded. Mr.Lee said that each type of command, such as opening documentsor inserting words into forms, was associated with anywherefrom 100 words to 300 words. He did not give the size of thesystem's total vocabulary.   Another problem: Making the speech-recognizer robustenough that background noise doesn't throw it off.   Apple's speech-recognizer requires speakers to begin eachcommand by addressing the computer with a prearranged name.Mr. Lee's name for his computer helper, or agent, is&quot;Casper.&quot; At one point in the demonstration, Mr. Lee askedCasper to pay two bills electronically, and he specified theamount of each check. Mr. Lee's request was carried out.   The promise of unfettered conversation with a computer hascaptivated people almost since the first electronic computingmachines were built in the mid-1940s. But accompanying thispromise has been a debate over the benefits of talking to acomputer, with skeptics saying only people with physicaldisabilities or other special problems will find much gainfrom talking much to machines.   Others, citing science fiction and their own instincts,say people will flock to computer conversation. In thecurrent television version of Star Trek, for instance, thecrew of the spaceship Enterprise routinely hail a ubiquitouscomputer and ask it questions in plain English.</TEXT></DOC>
