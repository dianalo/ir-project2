Here are milestones in the return tospaceflight:      1986      Jan. 28: Challenger, Flight 51-L _ the 25th shuttle mission _ isengulfed in a fireball 73 seconds after liftoff. Its crew of seven,including school teacher Christa McAuliffe, is killed. Within days,the cause is believed to be a plume of flame escaping from a jointin the right booster rocket.   Feb. 3: President Reagan appoints an independent commission,headed by former secretary of state William P. Rogers, toinvestigate.   Feb. 20: Richard H. Truly, a Navy admiral and former astronaut,is appointed head of NASA's spaceflight program, the first of aseries of top-level changes in the space agency's management.   March 7: An underwater search results in the discovery of theChallenger crew cabin containing the bodies of the astronauts.   April 18: Titan 34-D, carrying a military payload, explodes fiveseconds after launch from Vandenberg AFB, Calif.   May 3: Delta rocket, carrying a $57 million weather satellite,loses power 70 seconds after launch, veers out of control, and hasto be destroyed. It is the third straight launch failure of theU.S. space program.   May 15: Arnold Aldrich, manager of the shuttle system, tellsCongress that target date for next launch _ that of Discovery _ isJuly 15, 1987.   May 30: An Ariane-2 rocket fails and the West is left withoutlaunch capacity.   June 9: The Rogers commission blames the disaster on a leakthrough a faulty seal in Challenger's right booster that allowedhot gases to breach the fuel tank. The bottom booster-tankattachment gave way, hydrogen streamed from the failed tank and theshuttle was enveloped in a fireball. The commission criticizesNASA's launch decision, its internal communications breakdowns anda history of overlooking problems with the boosters.   June 17: Jane's Spaceflight Directory says the Soviets hold an``almost frightening'' lead in space over the United States.   June 19: NASA announces one of the first of many changesaffecting its cargo schedule, dropping plans to use the liquid-fuelCentaur rocket for interplanetary launches from the shuttle.   July 14: NASA administrator James C. Fletcher announces February1988 as new date for resumption of manned flights, blames delay ondifficulties in redesigning the booster.   July 16: Lawrence B. Mulloy, a key NASA official involved in theChallenger launch decision, retires rather than accept a transferwithin the agency.   July 28: NASA discloses the Challenger crew used three of theair packs aboard, indicating some remained conscious after theshuttle disintegrated.   Aug. 12: NASA announces new booster rocket design, using a thirdO-ring seal and latching feature.   Aug. 15: Reagan gives OK to building a replacement forChallenger and tells NASA to carry no more commercial satellites,in order to build private launch industry.   Sept. 5: A Delta rocket, carrying an SDI payload, is launchedsuccessfully from Cape Canaveral.   Nov. 5: Aldrich, one of the few officials involved with theChallenger launch still at the space agency, is named No. 2 man inthe shuttle program. Program controls are pulled into headquartersin major reorganization.   Dec. 29: Four of the astronaut families agree to settle allpotential claims against government. The amount is disclosed 14months later to be $7.7 million total, with Morton Thiokolcontributing $4.6 million.      1987      Jan. 9: The 5-man crew of STS-26, the first post-Challengermission, is named. Frederick H. Hauck, 45, is the commander.   Jan. 14: The National Research Council reports NASA can't safelymeet Feb. 18, 1988, launch target.   Jan. 20: NASA says it will put escape hatches on the shuttle.   Feb. 5: Jesse Moore, who gave final approval for Challengerlaunch, resigns from NASA.   March 26: An Atlas-Centaur rocket, one of two remaining, islaunched during electrical storm at Cape Canaveral, goes out ofcontrol, and is destroyed along with military communicationssatellite it is carrying.   April 21: NASA announces it can't meet Feb. 18, 1988, launchtarget.   May 6: Jane Smith, widow of Challenger pilot Michael Smith,files $1.5 billion suit against government, Morton Thiokol andMulloy.   May 17: Fletcher announces a mixed-fleet plan to acquireexpendable rockets to lessen dependence on the shuttle forsatellite launches.   May 20: NASA schedules first post-Challenger flight for June1988.   June 15: General Dynamics is the first company to enter theprivate launch business by announcing it will build 18Atlas-Centaurs over five years.   Aug. 30: The redesigned booster rocket is tested successfully atMorton Thiokol's Utah facility.   Sept. 15: Arianespace has first successful launch in 16 months.   Oct. 26: Air Force launches its first Titan 34D since same typeof rocket blew up April 18, 1986. It carries a secret payload,probably a spy satellite.   Nov. 23: National Research Council recommends additional testingof solid-fuel rocket, which might require postponing June launch.   Dec. 23: A part of the redesigned shuttle booster rocket motorbreaks off during test firing.   Dec. 29: NASA says it can't meet June 2 Discovery flight datebecause of booster test failure.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
