To study this issue required the development of a modelcapable of treating a several-day smog episode so that transport timessufficient to describe inter-basin transport episodes could be described.The model was applied to simulate the ozone episode of September 30 andOctober 1, 1980. For this work, a two basin emissions inventory for 1980was prepared. In addition, meteorology fields for the two-basin modeldomain were prepared. An updated version of the MATHEW model was developedwhich allows the user to specify the mixed-layer depth and restrictsflow across that layer. The effect of Bay Area hydrocarbon and nitrogenoxide emission controls were tested by separately reducing their emissionsby 30% in the Bay Area. We found that reducing hydrocarbons in the BayArea had a slight, but beneficial effect on the MBUAPCD. Ozone concentrationswere reduced in both air basins. Also, as expected, reducing nitrogenoxide emissions led to increased ozone concentrations in the Bay Area.Surprizingly, however, the effect of NO/sub x/ emissions was reversedat MBUAPCD receptor sites. There is a narrow downwind band in which ozoneconcentrations are decreased by about 1 pphm when NO/sub x/ emissionsare decreased. However, because the calculated effect is so small, itis also quite uncertain. Both meteorology changes and chemical mechanismchanges could alter the result. 66 refs., 200 figs., 26 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
