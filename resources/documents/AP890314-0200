Navy Capt. Will C. Rogers, who was commanding the Vincennes lastyear when its crew mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner, guidedthe ship out of the San Diego Naval Station for routine, daylongexercises off the California coast, a Navy spokesman said.   The FBI continued its investigation into the bombing of a vandriven by his wife, Sharon Rogers, and said it had not dismissed thepossibility that the bomb was planted by international terrorists.   Agency spokesman Ron Orrantia said it would be premature to ruleout any potential motive in Friday's bombing, including retributionfor the airliner downing.   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said Monday that the FBI appeared tobe backing off the theory that the bombing was internationallydirected terrorism because the device was a crude pipe bomb.   ``It is their belief a sophisticated terrorist, one who istrained in the use of explosives for car bombings, would have done abetter job and that (Mrs. Rogers) would not have escaped,'' Wilsonsaid.   Bu Orrantia said Tuesday, ``The FBI is not eliminating anythingat this point. We are leaving all avenues open right now. We are nottrying to limit our scope right now.''   Mrs. Rogers escaped the blast unhurt, getting out of the vanmoments before it caught fire and burned at a busy San Diegointersection.   The city Fire Department described the device as a pipe bomb. FBIofficials have said only that the explosive device was non-militaryin origin, possibly homemade, and that a pipe bomb would fall intothat generic category.   Fragments recovered from the blast scene have been sent to theFBI laboratory in Washington for analysis, and officials wereawaiting a final determination about the device's characteristics,Orrantia said.   He declined to discuss other aspects of the investigation, butsaid the FBI's report on the bomb would be publicly released when itis completed.   Law enforcement officials are looking into the possibility thatsomeone acted on a grudge against the Rogers family or that one ormore rogue Iranian supporters acted on their own, an FBI officialtold the Los Angeles Times.   Naval Investigative Service agents continue to protect Rogers andhis wife, who have been staying at an undisclosed location sinceFriday.   The Vincennes returned to San Diego last October, ending asix-month Persian Gulf deployment. It was during that deployment inJuly that the cruiser mistook a civilian airliner for a hostileaircraft during a firefight with Iranian surface ships and broughtit down with a missile. All 290 people aboard the plane were killed.</TEXT></DOC>
