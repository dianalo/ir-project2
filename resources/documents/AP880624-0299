The federal jury awarded no damages in the death last year ofJohn Ray Gunsalus, 55, of Chester.   The case was decided less than two weeks after a jury in Newark,N.J., decided three tobacco companies should pay $400,000 to thewidower of a lifelong smoker. It was the nation's first monetaryaward against a cigarette maker.   The jury in the Gunsalus case had to answer two questions: werePall Mall cigarettes prior to 1966 ``defective at the time sold inthat they failed to provide a warning,'' and were they asubstantial cause of Gunsalus' death?   The panel answered yes to the first question, faulting thecompany for not cautioning of the dangers of tobacco before 1966,when warnings began to be printed on cigarette packages as mandatedby Congress.   To the second question, the jury answered no. To award damages,it had to find that cigarettes were a substantial cause ofGunsalus' death. Gunsalus' estate had sought an unspecified amountfor pain and suffering.   Attorneys for American Tobacco cheered the verdict outside thecourtroom, but declined to comment to a reporter.   The eight-member jury had begun deliberations Thursday.   American Tobacco attorney Edward F. Mannino had contendedsmoking's dangers were not the issue, but instead told the jurythat Gunsalus drank heavily, suffered multiple stab wounds and hadthree heart attacks before dying of lung cancer.   Attorneys for Gunsalus' estate tried to show American Tobaccoproduced a defective product because cigarette packages carried nowarnings for people who work near asbestos. Gunsalus worked forseveral years at a Chester shipyard where asbestos was prevalent.   According to testimony from Dr. Paul Epstein of GraduateHospital in Philadelphia, Gunsalus died of cancer caused by smokingand asbestos exposure.   Epstein, a witness for the Gunsalus estate, said the interactionof asbestos and cigarette smoke causes a far greater risk of cancerthan either substance does on its own.   In closing remarks Thursday, Mannino said Gunsalus smokedbecause he chose to. He called Gunsalus as a ``strong-willed''person who ignored six doctors' warnings to quit smoking.   ``Nobody told John Gunsalus what to do,'' Mannino repeatedlytold the jury.   He described Gunsalus as a heavy drinker who drifted from job tojob, lived with other women while still married, suffered multiplestab wounds and three heart attacks before dying last year, stillunable or unwilling to give up his habit of smoking two packs ofPall Mall cigarettes a day.   Thomas F. Johnson, the attorney for Gunsalus' estate, angrilyrebutted Mannino's comments.   The ``unspoken assumption'' of American Tobacco's argument ``iswhat does it matter if we kill a bum?'' he told the jury.   ``He doesn't want to make it into a product liability case, andwants to make it into a plaintiff liability case,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
