Harper andamp; Row said its board named a committee of outside directors to consider the company's alternatives, which also could include proceeding with its current business plans, possible business combinations and sale of all or part of the company. The publisher also said it hired Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. as its financial adviser.    The directors met Friday, for the first time since Harper andamp; Row received the unsolicited offers. As previously reported, Theodore Cross, an investor, made an offer last Monday of $34 a share, or about $141 million, for the 170-year-old publisher. Two days later, Orlando, Fla.-based Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. offered $50 a share, or $220 million. Mr. Cross and Harcourt Brace officials couldn't be reached for comment.    Harper andamp; Row common shares closed Friday at $50.125, up 62.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was 316,700 shares. The company has about 4.4 million shares outstanding.    A Harper andamp; Row spokeswoman yesterday declined to comment beyond a prepared statement, and top officials of the company couldn't be reached. In the statement, however, the company indicated dismay at the turn of events. &quot;The directors unanimously expressed their strong desire to preserve the company's position as one of the nation's leading independent publishers, and take advantage of our considerable future prospects,&quot; said Winthrop Knowlton, a director and the publisher's former chief executive officer.    &quot;However,&quot; he added in the statement, &quot;given the significant current interest in the company, we also feel that we should carefully review all the options available.&quot;    Following last week's offers, securities analysts subsequently speculated that a bidding war could start for Harper andamp; Row, a major educational book publisher that also puts out medical and professional books. Moreover, analysts and industry officials concluded that the developments surrounding Harper andamp; Row probably signal further consolidation that could leave the industry with only a handful of major publishers.    In a related action, Harper andamp; Row directors postponed indefinitely an April 2 special meeting for shareholders to vote on a recapitalization proposal and a plan to create two classes of stock with unequal voting rights.    Separately, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it downgraded about $200 million of subordinated debt and commercial paper of Harcourt Brace after the company's offer for Harper andamp; Row.    Sandamp;P said it downgraded Harcourt's subordinated debt to double-B-plus from triple-B-minus and its commercial paper to A-3 from A-2. The rating concern said Harcourt's $220 million bid for Harper andamp; Row, coming after its $500 million debt-financed purchase of CBS Inc.'s publishing group last year, signals a &quot;much more aggressive policy regarding acquisitions than previously assumed.&quot;    The downgradings &quot;reflect Harcourt's new direction even if the proposed transaction ultimately doesn't take place,&quot; Sandamp;P said. The rating concern said a fully debt-financed acquisition would raise the company's pro-forma debt leverage to nearly 70% from 63%.    Harcourt officials didn't return phone calls seeking comment on the Sandamp;P action. </TEXT></DOC>
