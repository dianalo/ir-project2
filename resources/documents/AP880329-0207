GIVEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp;Co. stirred up the waters around Texaco Inc. on Tuesday, saying itwill seek federal approval to acquire up to 15 percent of the oilgiant's stock.   Kohlberg Kravis, which has carried out some of the largestleveraged buyouts in U.S. history, said an affiliate already hasacquired 11.95 million Texaco shares, or about 4.9 percent of theroughly 242 million shares outstanding.   A statement said the shares had been purchased ``some months agoin the open market.''   At its the White Plains, N.Y., headquarters, Texaco's responsewas upbeat.   ``Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has in past situations demonstrated anability to be a constructive shareholder, which recognizes theimportance of building value for the long term,'' the company saidin a statement. ``We have no indication that their intentions withTexaco are any different.''   Kohlberg Kravis directed queries to Kekst and Co., a publicrelations firm, where Ruth Pachman declined further comment.   Investors responded enthusiastically to Kohlberg Kravis'sanouncement. In nationwide trading of New York StockExchange-listed issues, Texaco jumped $3.25 a share from theprevious day's close, to $48.   Kohlberg Kravis became the fourth party to express interest inTexaco, which is to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy courtreorganization early next month.   Financier Carl C. Icahn is the White Plains, N.Y.-basedcompany's largest shareholder, holding 14.8 percent of its shares.   Oilman T. Boone Pickens also has sought federal regulatorypermission to buy up to 15 percent of Texaco's shares.   In addition, Getty Petroleum Co., an independent marketer ofpetroleum products that was born of Texaco's 1984 Getty Oil Co.acquisition, has made a similar filing.   The Texaco-Getty Oil deal started the nation's third largest oilcompany on the road to bankruptcy court.   In November 1985 a Houston jury ruled Texaco had improperlyinterfered with a move by Houston-based Pennzoil Co. to acquirepart of Getty, then bought Getty itself. The jury awarded Pennzoil$10.53 billion in damages.   While the figure was reduced by $2 billion on appeal, it stillstood at $10.3 billion, including interest, when Texaco filed forChapter 11 bankruptcy protection last April.   The company said it was forced to do so to avoid having to postan $11 billion bond while appealing the Houston jury's decision.   Last week, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge approved areorganization plan that will bring Texaco out of Chapter 11protection. As part of that plan, Pennzoil agreed to accept a $3billion payment to settle its damage claim.</TEXT></DOC>
