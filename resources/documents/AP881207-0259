Westinghouse acquired Unimation for $107 million in 1983.Unimation had been the nation's largest maker of industrial robots,with headquarters in Danbury, Conn., and several hundred employees.   Staubli International is a privately owned manufacturer ofprogrammable mechanisms for the textile industry, and its roboticsdivision makes a line of material handling systems.   Westinghouse spokesman Jay McCaffrey confirmed the sale, butwithheld details, saying it had agreed with Staubli not to announcethe deal until Thursday. The Pittsburgh Press said Wednesday thatthe sale was announced Tuesday to Westinghouse employees.   Unimation installed the world's first industrial robot in 1961,and in 1983 its share of that market was estimated at 40 percentwith sales of more than $71 million.   More than 50 competitors entered the field by 1982 looking for ashare of a market that some analysts had predicted would grow to $2billion in annual sales by 1992. The failure of those predictionsled to a number of firms being sold or closed.   Just after Westinghouse acquired Unimation, the market shifted toelectrically powered robots from the hydraulic models built byUnimation. The company responded to the switch, but lost business toa joint venture formed in 1982 by General Motors Corp. and FanucLtd. of Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
