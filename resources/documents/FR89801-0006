This amendment is prompted by a report of failure of a NLG strutassembly, which resulted in the separation of the NLG from the airplaneduring landing. This condition, if not corrected, could lead to loss ofcontrollability of the airplane upon landing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> September 7, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>The applicable service information may be obtainedfrom Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company, 86 South Cobb Drive, Marietta,Georgia 30063.

Due consideration has been given to the commentsreceived.The sole commenter, Lockheed, requested that the proposed repetitive inspectioninterval of 3,000 hours time-in-service be revised to 3,150 hours so thatinspections could be accomplished during operators' regular maintenanceschedules, and so as to fit Lockheed's recommended time between overhaulof 12,600 hours. The FAA concurs and has determined that extension of therepetitive inspection interval by an additional 150 hours will not havean adverse impact on safety. The final rule has been revised accordingly.Lockheed indicated that it is revising the applicable service bulletinto include additional information concerning procurement of equipment andto update certain rework procedures to reflect current practices. Lockheedrequested that issuance of the final rule be delayed until this revisionis available. The FAA does not concur. Lockheed has advised the FAA thatthe revision to the service bulletin will not be issued until November1989. In light of the safety implications addressed in the AD, the FAAconsiders it inappropriate to delay this action until that time. The FAAhas determined that the procedures provided in the current issue of theservice bulletin are adquate to accomplish the requirements of this AD.Lockheed also provided updated information as to the current number ofaffected airplanes in the worldwide and U.S. fleet. The eonomic impactanalysis paragraph below has been revised to include this new information.After careful review of the available data, including the comments notedabove, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest requirethe adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. These changeswill neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increasethe scope of the AD. There are approximately 36 Model 382 series airplanes of the affected designin the worldwide fleet. It is estimated that 21 airplanes of U.S. registrywill be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 74 manhoursper airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average laborcost will be $40 per manhour. Based on these figures, the total cost impactof the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $62,160 for the initialinspection cycle. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is nota ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positiveor negative, on a substantial number of small entities, under the criteriaof the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been preparedfor this action and is contained in the regulatory docket. A copy of itmay be obtained from the Rules Docket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 </ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends Part 39 of the Federal AviationRegulations as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
