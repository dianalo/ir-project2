A nearlylinear relationship between /sup 207/Bi and /sup 137/Cs was found. The/sup 207/Bi radioactivity was mainly ascribed to old H-bomb tests whichwere terminated in the early 1960's. Model calculations were carriedout to estimate the relative importance of three possible routes formingthe radionuclide /sup 207/Bi. Among them, the /sup 206,207/Pb(d, xn)/sup207/Bi reactions were found to contribute most.</TEXT></DOC>
