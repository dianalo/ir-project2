Mario Biaggi (D., N.Y.) and six others on a range of racketeering charges that greatly expand the Wedtech Corp. scandal.    The 58-count indictment describes the once-successful Wedtech, which relied on defense and postal-service contracts for 90% of its revenue, as a &quot;racketeering enterprise&quot; used as a vehicle to make illegal payments in exchange for government business.    Rep. Biaggi, whose district includes Wedtech, was charged with 21 felonies, among them perjury and the alleged extortion with a second defendant of 5%, or 225,000 shares, of Wedtech's stock in mid-1983. Rep. Biaggi was charged with personally accepting half the stock, valued at $1.8 million at the time.    A total of 14 people have now been indicted or pleaded guilty in the Wedtech case, which officials said yesterday has become one of the largest public-corruption investigations in U.S. history. Wedtech is currently operating under bankruptcy-law protection, with new management.    Named in yesterday's indictment were: Rep. Biaggi, who is 69 years old; Stanley Simon, 57, former Bronx borough president, who was already named in an indictment in April; Peter Neglia, 39, former head of the Small Business Administration's office for New York, New Jersey and Puerto Rico; and John Mariotta, 57, who founded Wedtech's predecessor company in 1965 and became a highly regarded entrepreneur before being ousted from Wedtech last year.    Also named: Bernard Ehrlich, 58, a partner at the Biaggi andamp; Ehrlich law firm and a former Wedtech director, who was charged with demanding the 225,000 shares with Rep. Biaggi; Richard Biaggi, 38, the congressman's son; and Ronald Betso, 39, described as a friend of Mr. Neglia.    Each was charged with violating the federal Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, as well as various other crimes. If convicted of all counts, the defendants face maximum sentences ranging from 60 to 181 years in prison each, as well as millions of dollars in fines.    Among other charges, Mr. Neglia, the former SBA official, allegedly demanded that Wedtech pay $3,000 to Republican organizations on his behalf -- money that allegedly was paid out -- and demanded and received a stock option for 20,000 Wedtech shares issued in Mr. Betso's name.    Mr. Mariotta, the Wedtech founder, was charged with 15 felonies; the indictment alleges he defrauded the SBA in two &quot;sham&quot; stock-purchase agreements that misrepresented that he owned a majority of Wedtech, as required to win contracts in the SBA's minority-owned businesses program.    Mr. Mariotta's attorney said any wrongdoing at Wedtech was committed by other officials, who made his client no more than a &quot;figurehead&quot; by the time of his ouster. Mr. Simon also maintains his innocence.    Messrs. Neglia, Ehrlich and Betso, and Rep. Biaggi's son couldn't be reached.    Rep. Biaggi was accused of demanding the 225,000 Wedtech shares under threat that Biaggi andamp; Ehrlich would withdraw as the company's attorneys and the SBA would drop its support of the company. It was also alleged that he extorted $50,000, disguised as legal fees, for assisting Wedtech with local officials.    Rep. Biaggi already faces bribery and conspiracy charges contained in an indictment handed down in a Brooklyn federal court in March. Those charges, which he denies, relate to his alleged actions with the Navy and Coast Guard on behalf of New York-based Coastal Dry Dock andamp; Repair Corp.    Rep. Biaggi vigorously denied the charges in yesterday's indictment. &quot;I am innocent and want to prove it,&quot; he said.    He criticized prosecutors for the &quot;months of trying this case in the media,&quot; and said he had offered to submit to a lie-detector test to prove his innocence. Instead, he said, the government had accepted at &quot;face value&quot; the statements of a &quot;pantheon of known liars and convicted felons, all desperate to save their skins.&quot;    Four former top Wedtech officials who pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe government officials and looting the company of at least $2 million are cooperating with the prosecutors' probe.    Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, at a news conference attended by a large group of Labor Department, Internal Revenue Service, SBA and other officials, declined to say if he had learned of any evidence of wrongdoing committed by Attorney General Edwin Meese, who has acknowledged interceding on Wedtech's behalf in 1982 in connection with a big Army contract. Mr. Giuliani said only that, in general, all evidence in the New York probe has been turned over to independent counsel James McKay, who is investigating Mr. Meese. </TEXT></DOC>
