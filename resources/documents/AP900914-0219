DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Capitol Hill staffers say a suggested tax onsecurities transactions appears to be foundering, but opponents arestill mounting a massive lobbying effort just in case.   ``I think rumors of the demise of it are probably premature, butI haven't heard any great clamoring out there for it. I have nottalked to anyone who thinks its a good idea, but it's not dead,'' alobbyist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Thursday.   However, several congressional staffers - who did not want to beidentified during the sensitive budget negotiations - said thetax's chances look weak, at best.   ``The transaction tax is, I think, dead,'' said a House stafferfamiliar with the budget discussions. ``If there's any life to it,it's wheezing on the floor.''   ``The last I heard, it was not dead but it seemed to bereeling,'' said a staffer on another House committee.   Securities firms have run newspaper ads against a rumoredtransaction tax on the sale of stocks, bonds, futures contracts andother financial products. Opponents say the tax would hurteveryone, not just Wall Street, because the tax would eventually bepassed on to customers and make it harder for companies and localgovernments to raise money through bonds and other securities.   There have been published reports since July that the Bushadministration was considering a stock trading excise tax between.15 percent and .5 percent as a means of closing the budget gap.   Officials believe that the deficit will likely exceed $250billion - a record - in the upcoming fiscal year unless somethingis done. Without a budget agreement by Oct. 1, the Gramm-Rudmandeficit-reduction law will shrink the $1.2 trillion budget by $100billion, an amount that would disrupt most federal programs andagencies.   But since securities and futures exchanges, pension and mutualfund groups and local politicians in New York and Chicago rose upto oppose the proposed securities tax, little has been heard aboutit around Congress.   ``In broad terms, I've heard no mention of that kind of taxbeing proposed by anyone in these discussions,'' said a Senate aideclose to the negotiations who spoke on condition he not beidentified.   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that a broadly based.5 percent tax on all securities except Treasury securities wouldraise about $12 billion a year to start.   But opponents say those numbers will never be reached becausethe tax would make trading more expensive, driving businessoverseas and leaving fewer transactions to tax.   They also say the increased costs to high volume traders likeinsurance companies and pension funds would be passed on tocustomers, pensioners or - in the case of public employee pensionfunds - taxpayers.   Even the Congressional Research Service, in a report issued inJuly, noted that a half penny tax on transactions could cut tradingvolume in the stock market by 7.9 percent and reduce stock marketprices by as much as 7.7 percent.   Numerous groups spearheded by the Securities IndustryAssociation and the Public Securities Association have writtenCongress and the White House arguing against a securities tax.   New York City officials have also been vocal in their oppositionto the tax, saying it would hurt the city's securities industry andthe local economy.</TEXT></DOC>
