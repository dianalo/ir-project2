The Massachusetts governor doggedly promised to campaign inevery primary state through California, even after a smashing winin Pennsylvania on Tuesday over Democratic presidential JesseJackson gave him a big lead in the nomination fight.   Dukakis brushed aside concerns that Jackson's attempts to setthe policy agenda would split the Democrats, even as he fired againat Bush, the certain GOP nominee.   ``I see very broad agreement in the Democratic Party,'' he toldreporters in a statehouse news conference. ``I don't believe it isgoing to be very difficult to get a good strong platform.''   The Democratic hopeful spent most of the day on state businessbefore going to Springfield, Mass., to highlight his support forplant-closing legislation nearing final passage in Washington. Hetook the occasion to fire a round at Bush on whether Bush supportsPresident Reagan's promised veto of the bill.   ``I think the vice president would be well advised to stopcriticizing others for a while and address some fundamental issuesfacing this country,'' Dukakis told the news conference. ``Where ishe on the plant-closing bill? Doesn't he think it is the right andfair thing to let workers and their families know at least 60 daysin advance that they are going to be thrown out of work?''   Bush said earlier Wednesday that he was ready for attacks on theIran-Contra affair.   ``Let him fire away,'' Bush said.   Dukakis obliged: ``He sat there and did nothing while we engagedin one of the worst and one of the most misguided adventures in thehistory of American foreign policy. I can't imagine what they werethinking of when they proceeded to do business with a terroristnation.''   Later, he added: ``That's going to be an issue in the campaign,no question about it.''   He also took a swipe at those who said a Bush-Dukakis campaignwould be a fight between dull politicians.   ``I've never been in a dull, boring contest in my life and Idon't expect this one to be one either,'' he said. .   Dukakis was always careful to preface his comments about thefall campaign with the supposition that he would be the nominee.After winning the Tuesday primary, he promised to campaign in everystate primary between now and June 7.   That strategy is not only an effort to avoid an embarrassingloss for the front-runner, but also to build for the fall campaign.   ``We are working hard in California,'' said Dukakis campaignmanager Susan Estrich. ``California is also very important in thegeneral election. As much as we can do there now is also aninvestment for the fall.''   Dukakis heads back out on the campaign trail Thursday to Ohio,which holds a primary next Tuesday along with Indiana and theDistrict of Columbia.   The six weeks between May 3 and June 7 will be busy ones forDukakis, his aides say, but less with campaigning and more withefforts directed at pulling the Democrats together and gettingready for the fall.   He will return to states which have already taken part in theprimary process _ such as Texas _ make major speeches on education,jobs and the environment. He will travel to Washington to meet withparty leaders and perhaps make a commencement address on a blackuniversity campus to symbolize his reaching out to the blackcommunity that has been solidly behind Jackon.</TEXT></DOC>
