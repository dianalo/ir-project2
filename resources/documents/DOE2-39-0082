It has also proved to bea good technique for measuring point-density (void-fraction) in two-phaseflow systems. The present day CAT-scanners employ alogorithms which areessentially a discrete implementation of the Radon Inversion Formulae.These methods of reconstructing density distributions are fast and easyto implement. The present work is an attempt to simplify (and consequentlyto speed-up) the existing algorithms for the cases of radially symmetricdensity distribution. The method uses Radon Inversion Formulae and involvesBessels's Function of Fourier frequency. The algorithm was tested onsome known distributions and the reconstruction is excellent. Data forbubbly-flow was also processed to obtain a point density distribution.The range of investigation was 0.6 {le} andless;rhoandgt; {le} 0.9 g/cm/sup 3/, where'andless; andgt;' denotes average cross-sectional value. The values of andless;rho/sub CT/andgt;are within +-0.03 g/cm/sup 3/ of the true values andless;rhoandgt;, for the datasets considered. The results are comparable with another simple methodinvolving radial polynominals. It is observed that the simplified RadonInversion Formulae for the radially symmetric case gives good resultsand can be implemented with ease.</TEXT></DOC>
