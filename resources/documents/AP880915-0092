WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Afer donning a military helmet and jump suit andtaking one of the Army's 60-ton M-1 Abrams tanks out for a spin,Michael Dukakis asked his observers for a review.   ``What did you think?'' he asked. ``Did I look like I belongedup there in that tank?''   The full answer won't be in for a while, though the Democraticpresidential nominee has spent this week doing his utmost to makethe picture of himself perched atop the nation's military machineryseem reasonable and natural.   Stung by Republican assaults on him as weak on defense, Dukakissounded downright hawkish at times. He delivered three majoraddresses that were an attempt to stake out positions of strengthon weapons, U.S.-Soviet relations, and national security _ all thewhile presenting himself as no newcomer to toughness.   ``We're going to have strong strategic forces, we're going tohave strong conventional forces, and we're going to clean up themess in the Pentagon,'' he said Wednesday in Annapolis, Md., hisfinal national security speech before heading West today to viewfire damage in Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., and meet withWestern governors.   Dukakis was motivated in part by polls suggesting RepublicanGeorge Bush has succeeded in raising questions about the Democraton defense matters. In a New York Times-CBS News poll this week,four in 10 voters said Dukakis would weaken the nation's defenses,while only one in 10 said he would strengthen them.   What emerged from Dukakis's efforts was a fairly conventionaland unstartling view of East-West relations. The expectedDemocratic emphasis on arms control was coupled with tough talkabout Soviet intentions _ he called Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbacheva ``Leninist'' who has not abandoned Soviet world goals.   He added to that eyes-open view of the Soviets the prospect that``improved Soviet behavior in world affairs'' may be achieved byholding out the carrot of enhanced economic ties and fulleradmission into the world economic community.   On weapons systems _ the area where Bush has scored points withhis scornful assaults on the Democrat as the ``Stealth candidate''_ Dukakis's positions appear to be still emerging.   The Massachusetts governor's ride in the M-1 tank, in a grassyfield by a General Dynamics test and design facility in SterlingHeights, Mich., on Tuesday, provided the pictures to go along withhis talk of military might. It fit nicely into the area of weaponrythat he most likes to discuss _ his call for improvements inconventional forces and his accusation that the Reaganadministration has been willing to make sacrifices in personnel andnon-nuclear spending to pay for its Strategic Defense Initiativeand more nuclear arms.   Dukakis did not, however, answer the question of how he wouldmodernize the land-based leg of the nation's nuclear triad (land,air and sea). Nor did he offer specific explanation of how he holdsopen the possibility of modernization while opposing the optionsthat are available.   Speaking at Georgetown University in Washington on Wednesday, heruled out the MX missile deployed on rails as a ``Pearl Harborstyle'' target. He struck a noticeably more favorable note thanbefore on the proposed smaller Midgetman missile, calling itstrategically ``sound.'' But he dismissed it as too expensive _ andthree times the cost of submarine-based warheads.   Aides said Dukakis views the question of the next generation ofland-based nuclear missiles as still evolving, and that he wouldawait further study of those missiles and other, lesser known andlesser developed possible alternatives as president.   After blasting ``Republican blue smoke and mirrors'' on nuclearmissiles, Dukakis dismissed the modernization issue this way:   ``So I'm going to work with the Congress to find a sensible,affordable way to maintain the effectiveness of the land-basedmissile leg of the triad.''   Dukakis committed himself to production and deployment of theStealth bomber, which he pointedly noted was begun under PresidentCarter. He visited General Electric's Ohio plant where engines forthe Stealth and other aircraft are made, and was met with a chorusof boos from skeptical workers whose jobs depend on defensecontracts.   Though he didn't acknowledge it, his pledge to complete theStealth appeared to go beyond previous qualified support forStealth research that left open a decision on deployment until theplane is fully tested.   Dukakis restated his concerns about the B-1 bomber, which hesays is too expensive and unreliable as a bomber capable ofpenetrating enemy territory. He pointed to his support for the newTrident II submarine-based missile and for advanced cruise missiles.   On SDI, the Star Wars anti-missile defense project, Dukakiscontinued to ridicule Reagan administration spending while at thesame time backing $1 billion a year worth of SDI research _ about aquarter of current spending.   A week earlier Dukakis raised eyebrows when, at a newsconference after addressing the American Legion, he suggested hewould deploy a Star Wars program if it was ``essential to ournational security.'' But at the same time he said Star Warsdeployment would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty(ABM), which he said remains in the nation's best interest.   He has taken what is essentially a middle ground, supportingsome research on the hope a successful defense against nuclearweapons is possible through technology, while opposing largerspending that he contends will come out of conventional forces orother programs.   In his Georgetown speech, Dukakis spoke of Star Wars asundermining ``the stability of the nuclear balance.''   ``If we're going to make our defense dollars count, we've got tostop pouring billions and billions into this program, and do somehard thinking about what we're trying to achieve,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
