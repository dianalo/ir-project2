Or, as Jeff Haynes, owner of a commercial landscaping service,says, &quot;Drip systems are 'politically correct' now.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TRICKLE, MIST OR WEEP?VERSATILE IRRIGATION SYSTEMS PUT GARDEN WATERTO BEST USE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;The idea is to bring water directly to the plants,&quot; Haynes says, notingthere is little loss to evaporation with drip systems.;    While a concernover water conservation is part of the equation, it's the ease with which dripsystems can be installed and adapted that is the primary selling point,dealers say.;    &quot;Drip systems are very forgiving. (They) are more versatile,you don't need glue and it's simple and inexpensive to install,&quot; says systemdealer Vickie Zylstra.;    In general, drip equipment includes flexible supplyhose, referred to in the trade as &quot;polypipe&quot; to distinguish it from the rigidPVC pipe used in conventional sprinkler systems. It's found typically in 1/2-,1/4- and 1/8-inch (spaghetti tubing) dimensions that can be fitted with avariety of attachments.;    Water comes out of either emitters that tricklewater slowly at the base of a plant or microspray heads that deliver a finemist in patterns ranging from as little as a 20-degree arc to a full circle.Likewise, perforated tubing (round or flat) that &quot;weeps&quot; and is intended forwatering tightly spaced row-crop plants is the micro-version of thetraditional soaker hose.;    Drip system prices vary depending on howelaborate the system is, but individual pieces are significantly cheaper thantheir conventional system counterparts. A starter kit costs about $20.;   Emitters can be adjusted for volume, delivering a half-gallon to 10 gallonsper hour. They can be equipped with pressure regulators to ensure they alwaysdeliver their specified output no matter whether they are on feeder lines orwhether compensation is needed for variations in water pressure on a line thatgoes uphill or downhill. Some emitters come equipped with bug caps to keepcritters from crawling into the tiny orifices.;    For all its versatility, adrip system is not main- tenance-free. Two of the most important safeguards,and ones often overlooked by homeowners who install their own drip systems,are pressure regulators and filters.;    Mark Holland, an irrigation andplumbing wholesaler, says drip systems typically operate in the range of 15 to25 pounds per square inch. That's well below typical home water pressures.While conventional sprinkler systems usually can vent off excessive pressurethrough misting, too much pressure can burst pipes or pop off emitters on dripsystems.;    Excessive pressure also can mean the systems won't work, withspray patterns becoming larger than intended, forcing more output thandesired.;    The solution is a pressure reducer or regulator, installed eithernear the front end of the system or on individual sprinkling devices.;   Filtration also is important. Because drip systems operate on low pressure andsmall quantities of water are delivered through tiny holes, even minuteparticles can clog them.;    Fine-mesh screens fitted into drip system tubinggenerally are adequate for most municipal water supplies. But more elaboratefiltration systems, perhaps involving sand or charcoal, may be required if adrip system's water comes from wells or where the water has a high mineralcontent.;    Michael Lander, a landscape architect, advises flushing linesoccasionally, including a few runs during the winter months to help preventcrusting of minerals.;    Landscapers recommend checking emitters visuallyperhaps once a month to ensure they're not clogged. Unlike conventionalsprinklers, it's not always obvious when emitters aren't working because theydeliver such small quantities of water and may be out of sight under shrubberyor ground cover.;    Landscapers also emphasize the importance of fitting dripsystems to the water requirements of the plants.;    For instance, whileemitters are typically placed at the base of a plant when it's small, theactive root zone of a plant moves out as the plant grows, and emitters need tobe moved outward as well.;    Emitters should always be located near the dripline of the plant -- the area directly below the outermost edge of the plant'scrown. Too often they are left in their original location, especially when thesystem is buried.;    There are pluses and minuses to burying a drip system.Advantages include better appearance and less likelihood of lines beingunintentionally knocked out of place. Lines above ground, however, are easierto repair or modify.;    IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; A free workshop on how toinstall drip irrigation will be held at 10:30 a.m. Saturday at GuadalupeGarden Center, 715 Spring St., San Jose.
