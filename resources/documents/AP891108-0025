Dennis DeConcini to drop a rule barring riskyinvestments by the now-defunct Lincoln Savings and Loan Association,whose owner was a major political contributor.   Former Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Edwin J. Gray toldthe House Banking Committee on Tuesday that DeConcini, D-Ariz., madethe request to him in an April 2, 1987, meeting in DeConcini'soffice attended by three other senators.   The four senators _ who received $1.3 million in contributionsarranged by Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr., whocontrolled Lincoln _ all have acknowledged they were at the meetingbut denied knowledge of such a request.   The others present at the meeting, Gray testified, were Sens.John McCain, R-Ariz.; Alan Cranston, Calif., and John Glenn, D-Ohio.   The other three senators, Gray testified, ``raised no objectionwhatsoever'' when DeConcini proposed ``that I withdraw a dulyadopted regulation on behalf of their `friend' and theircontributor.''   He quoted DeConcini as saying the senators would convince their``friend'' to make more home loans if the regulation was withdrawnuntil after it had been tested in the courts.   ``It sounded like a quid pro quo,'' Gray said. ``It was a quidpro quo.''   The four senators, plus Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Michigan, nowchairman of the Senate Banking Committee, also have acknowledgedmeeting a week later with regional Bank Board officials based in SanFrancisco who had been called to Washington to answer questionsabout an ongoing audit of Lincoln.   All five senators have been asked by the Senate Ethics Committeeto explain in detail their presence at the two April 1987 meetings,but the Senate panel has begun no formal investigation.   Bob Maynes, a spokesman for DeConcini, said his boss and thethree other senators have consistently taken issue with Gray'sdescription of the meeting.   ``There were five people in that room _ Gray and the foursenators,'' he said, ``and all four senators have said on the recordthat Gray is totally and completely inaccurate.''   But Gray said a claim that he ``fabricated such a yarn ... simplyis not credible.''   ``The fact that this meeting became public knowledge has deeplyembarrassed these senators,'' he testified. ``They have every reasonin the world to deny what Sen. DeConcini offered me in that meetingbecause he was, evidently, speaking on their behalf.''   His testimony came in the fourth of a series of hearings by theHouse committee on why regulators waited two years after bank boardexaminers concluded that Lincoln was acting in an unsafe and unsoundmanner before seizing control of it.   Federal regulators seized Lincoln last April and said they couldhave to pay up to $2 billion to depositors whose federally insuredsavings were lost through Lincoln's risky investments.   The Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created by Congress toclean up the thrift industry mess, filed a $1.1 billion suit inSeptember against Lincoln and Keating, alleging fraud andracketeering.   Keating, who has said he arranged several millions of dollars incontributions to members of both political parties this decade,purchased the 29-branch Lincoln Sandamp;L in Irvine, Calif., in 1984.   He also had been scheduled to testify Tuesday before the Housepanel but his appearance was postponed for two weeks at the requestof his attorneys.   Another witness Tuesday, Jack Atchison, refused to answer anyquestions, claiming a Fifth Amendment constitutional right againstself-incrimination.   Atchison was in charge of auditing Lincoln for Arthur Young andamp; Co.in 1987 and wrote nearly identical letters to Riegle, McCain andDeConcini that March supporting assertions by Lincoln's officialsthat it was being harassed by bank board examiners.   Shortly afterward, according to the House panel's chairman, Rep.Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Tex., Atchison resigned from Arthur Young andtook a $900,000-a-year job with Lincoln's parent company, AmericanContinental Corp., which is chaired by Keating.   In other testimony Tuesday:   _Former California Sandamp;L Commissioner Larry Taggert acknowledgedthat four weeks before leaving his job at the end of 1984, heapproved a change in state regulations that allowed Lincoln to make$900 million in direct investments that would have been forbidden bya new federal policy.   While still in office, Taggert was listed in a filing with theSecurities and Exchange Commission as a board member of TCSFinancial, a San Diego investment consulting firm that Lincolnbankrolled in January 1985 with a $2.89 million purchase of stock.   _Former Bank Board Member Lee Henkel, who had more than $2million in loans from Lincoln when named to the board in 1986,testified that he recused himself from all decisions involvingLincoln during his five-month term. He denied allegations by Grayand others that his proposal at his first board meeting to``grandfather'' exclusions for direct investments prior to December1984 from the regulation was at Lincoln's behest.   ``I had no idea at the board what was going on at Lincoln,'' hesaid, adding that he had no conversations with Keating or any ofKeating's representatives before drafting it.</TEXT></DOC>
