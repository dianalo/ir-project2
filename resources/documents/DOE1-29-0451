Ideal sites for stress barriers, and hence for magmachambers, are rock formations where individual layers have differentelastic properties. The rocks formed during the Pleistocene have notablydifferent elastic properties, and when buried in the volcanic zones,they form more promising sites for magma chambers than the Tertiary rocks.This may explain why the number of magma chambers, indicated by the numberof corresponding central volcanoes, during the late Pleistocene (i.e.,during the past 0.7 m.y.) appears to be proportionally greater than thenumber of chambers (i.e., central volcanoes) active during Tertiary time.</TEXT></DOC>
