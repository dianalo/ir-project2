Diel, TTI's vice president ofsales.andM;&quot;The technical challenge is to actually interpret [Exabyte] SCSI commands forthe HSC controller,&quot; TTI's Diel said.andP;  &quot;Is it possible [to produce thesubsystem]?andP;  Yes.andP;  Is it possible with what's out there?andP;  No,&quot; said Diel.andM;&quot;The technology is required.andP;  People are hurting,&quot; said MTI's Hicksted.andM;&quot;It's the right fit.andP;  The HSC is generally controlling a disk farm.andP;  There's[been] no alternative for unattended backup,&quot; added SI's Tashbook.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
