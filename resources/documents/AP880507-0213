ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER, Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The idea has a nice ring toit: Tokyo in two hours. Zooming over the Earth at 25 times thespeed of sound. Crossing the Pacific in an airplane sorevolutionary the space shuttle and the Concorde become old hat.   Third millenium, here we come.   That airplane, or something like it, is taking shape at this andother NASA centers in bits and pieces: a model is assaulted in awind tunnel by 4,800 mph blasts in temperatures hundreds of degreesbelow zero; an electron beam illuminates air flow around ascaled-down plane; a sleek cylinder zips through a water trough3,000-feet long, sensitive to every nuance of resistance; aphotograph captures shock wave and heat patterns in ghostly hues ofgreen, orange, yellow, blue and magenta; the most powerful computerever built ingests world-class problems and spits out answers; astandard airplane circles over Chesapeake Bay, piloted not from thestandard cockpit in front, but from a second, all-electronic one,in its passenger section.   The ``Little A'' in NASA _ the aeronautics part of NationalAeronautics and Space Administration _ is not as flashy as the``Big S'' and gets only 7 percent of the agency's budget, but itsaccomplishments brush our lives in thousands of ways.   A poultry plant in Marietta, Ga., is quieter because of NASAaeronautics; water quality in many places is improved because ofaeronautics technology; firemen wear better protective clothing.   ``We are called the space agency by many, probably includingyourself,'' Jeremiah F. Creedon, the director for flight systems atthe Langley Research Center, tells a visitor, a bit of resignationin his voice. ``Many of us here think the A is a large one.''   Langley's work is divided roughly 60 percent aeronautics, 40percent space, with a hefty dose of military work in both. Withother NASA research centers _ Ames and Dryden in California andLewis in Ohio _ its business is to develop technology and pass iton, without cost, to aircraft companies. The federal government hasplayed that role from the start of its involvement 70 years ago.   The agency has never built an airplane, but few planes fly todaywithout engines, designs, materials and structures conceived atNASA. ``We are doing research that benefits the country,'' saysCreedon. ``It is available to Boeing, Lockheed and McDonnellDouglas, whoever wants to build transport or high performanceaircraft.'' No single company alone could afford NASA's $2 billioninvestment in wind tunnels.   Here at Langley, they don't talk about the ``Orient Express.''It's either the NASP, the National Aerospace Plane, or better yetthe X-30, next in a string of experimental planes that began withChuck Yeager's X-1, breaker of the sound barrier.   When President Reagan made his rosy prediction about the OrientExpress, a week after the Challenger space shuttle disaster,engineers had already taken years to decide the X-30 was possible.Reagan's one paragraph announcement signaled the start of Phase 2,perfecting the technology, which will last until the summer of1990, when engineers will take a hard look at where they stand anddecide whether to build the X-30. Phase 3, in the mid-90s, wouldsee the aerospace plane begin flight tests that would finish as the21st century begins.   That's the timetable for the largest experimental aircraftproject ever undertaken by the United States. It will cost $3.3billion. Clearly NASA and the Air Force, which is sharing the cost,have something more practical in mind than building one or twoprototype planes, merely to prove it can be done.   The military and package-delivery firms such as Federal Expressand UPS are the only ones likely to have use for a plane flying 25times the speed of sound _ fast enough to get into orbit. But theaerospace plane will provide the technology for the somewhat slowerbut far more useful aircraft of the future.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
