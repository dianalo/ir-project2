<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-75-1196 </DOCNO><TEXT>The elementary processes to excite hypernuclei, p({gamma}, K/sup +/){Lambda}and p({gamma}, K/sup +/){Sigma}/sup 0/, have been calculated in the Bornapproximation. We used the coupling constants previously determined byother authors. It is found that no set of coupling constants given inthe literature can consistently reproduce the observed cross sectionseven at low energies.</TEXT></DOC>
