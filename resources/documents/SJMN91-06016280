Three large 5,000-square-foot houses werebuilt last year at the top of College Avenue, looming over the neighborhood.;   &quot;People are telling us 'we are opposed to other things that have gone on,therefore we're going to oppose you,' &quot; Grabill told the council. &quot;We'd liketo be judged on our own.&quot;;    Grabill said he has collected a total of 58signatures supporting his project, many of them College Avenue residents.;   The council urged Grabill and partners Chris Benson, John Hannegan and MarieJohnson to redo their plans with an eye toward providing more street andoff-street parking at the lot. They were urged to take a &quot;new&quot; proposal beforethe planning commission, which originally denied the project in October.;   Irwin Joseph, who represents College and Euclid Avenue residents opposing theproject, said &quot;it's not a matter of us being against development. This is anill-conceived project that shouldn't go forward.&quot;;    Earl Thompson, who livesacross the street from the property where one home was built last year thatnow awaits sale, said that &quot;one house is more than adequate on that land. Youcan't try to squeeze two in there.&quot;;    Others said they were disappointedwhen Grabill bought the lot at 126 College Ave. after an earthquake-damagedhome there was demolished, and quickly rebuilt using the town's &quot;fast-track&quot;process.;    That process allowed the partners to circumvent the cumbersomepermit process by duplicating the original two-story house.;    Residents nowsay the developers are being greedy by seeking to build a second home on a lotthat is less than the standard 8,000 square feet.;    Three others spoke infavor of the project, saying it would enhance College Avenue.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CONNIE SKIPITARES, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910116  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  466  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 16, 199100016280,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
