The resignations came after bank employees and the public condemned the board's approval of a $4 million severance payment and $30,000-a-month pension for the bank's former chairman, Ernst Japhet. Mr. Japhet was forced to resign after a judicial inquiry found him partly responsible for a collapse of commercial bank shares in 1983 that cost Israelis millions of dollars in savings. Before resigning, the directors suspended Mr. Japhet's pension.    About 4,000 cases of multiple applications have been identified in connection with last month's BRITISH GAS PLC share offering, Britain's Department of Energy said. Prospective buyers were limited to one application each, but it is suspected that some people applied more than once. The government expects to raise about $8 billion from the oversubscribed issue, the largest public offering ever.    TAP-AIR PORTUGAL said it will buy three AIRBUS INDUSTRIE A310-300 jets in a $250 million transaction. The planes will replace Boeing Co. 707s. The accord includes an option for two more Airbus jets by 1991.    Rolls-Royce Motors Ltd., a unit of VICKERS PLC of Britain, said world-wide sales of its luxury cars rose 9.5% last year, to 2,603 units. </TEXT></DOC>
