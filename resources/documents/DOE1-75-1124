The values of the average charge and potentialstrength were determined graphically from the single intersection ofcorrelation curves drawn for varying uranium concentrations. The effectsof temperature and liquid-phase concentration of chloride ions on theaverage charge of adsorbed uranyl complexes were examined in this manner.As a result, several species of uranyl complex ions, including higher-ordercomplexes bearing more than five chlorine atoms, were strongly suggestedto coexist on the anion-exchange resin. This finding is noteworthy becausethese higher-order complex ions are known to be unstable in aqueous solutionsdue to their steric hindrance and have never been observed either insolutions or on anion-exchange resins. The conventional graphical methodfor determining the coordination number of adsorbed metal complex ionswas reviewed and compared with the present method. The latter provideda drawing of isotherm curves which fitted better the experimental resulsover a rather wide range of uranium concentrations.</TEXT></DOC>
