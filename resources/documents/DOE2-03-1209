Dry gas production (wet marketedproduction minus 67 billion cubic feet of extraction loss) totaled anestimated 1343 billion cubic feet, 1.7 percent above the May 1987 level.The total dry gas supply available for disposition in May 1988 was estimatedat 1490 billion cubic feet, including 35 billion cubic feet withdrawnfrom storage, 11 billion cubic feet of supplemental supplies, and 101billion cubic feet that were imported. In May 1987, dry gas availablefor disposition totaled 1419 billion cubic feet. Of the total dry gassupply available for disposition in May 1988, an estimated 1259 billioncubic feet were consumed, 294 billion cubic feet were injected into undergroundstorage reservoirs, and 5 billion cubic feet were exported, leaving 68billion cubic feet unaccounted for.</TEXT></DOC>
