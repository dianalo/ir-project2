(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Production workers at John Deere andamp; Co.'splant in Horicon ratified a 3-year contract Monday, ending a nearlymonth-long strike.   Members of Local 873 of the International Association ofMachinists and Aerospace Workers voted 666-205 in favor of theproposed 3-year contract, the company announced. The local hasabout 940 employees.   ``We just received word that the contract passed by a 78 percentto 22 percent margin,'' said Deere spokesman Bob Combs. ``Thatobviously brings the strike to a conclusion.''   Combs and union officials declined to release details of the newcontract, which will expire Oct. 1, 1991.   ``It was a very comprehensive proposal,'' Combs said. ``Like anycontract, (it) was a compromise.''   A tentative agreement was reached Friday after unionrepresentatives and company officials met for the entire day.   Some employees will report back to work Tuesday and the restwill be back to work by Wednesday, union spokesman Steve Kovalaskesaid.   Machinists ratified the contract Monday during a three-hourmeeting at Horicon High School, Kovalaske said.   The workers went on strike Oct. 1, one day after voting toreject the company's last offer. The plant, which produces lawn andgarden equipment, has been idle since the strike began.   The only other strike at the Horicon plant was in December 1958when union members walked out for a week.   The Machinists union is still on strike against EasternAirlines, where it was joined by pilots and flight attendantsstarting March 4. The union also is continuing a walkout againstaircraft maker Boeing Co. which began early this month.</TEXT></DOC>
