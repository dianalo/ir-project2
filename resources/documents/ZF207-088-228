(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>LOW/MID-SPEED DOT MATRIX PRINTERS GET NEW RESPECTandM;Long the unglamorous workhorses of the DEC printer market, dot matrixproducts are gaining new respect, thanks to the improved print quality ofpopular 24-wire print heads.andM;Alps, Panasonic and NEC are among the big-name vendors that have recentlyintroduced dot matrix products priced below $600.andP;  According to DatekInformation Services, a Newtonville, Mass., market research company, 24-wire(or 24-pin) models are the fastest growing type of printers.andP;  High demand isexpected into the 1990s.andM;In the DEC market, all types of dot matrix printers continue to be popularbecause of their versatility, reliability, economical price, and good speedand throughput.andM;Although early dot matrix printers' print quality was so poor that longpieces of text were nearly unreadable, the print from today's better matrixprinters is difficult to distinguish from daisywheel or laser output.andM;Besides the improvements in print quality over the last six months, dotmatrix printers have seen other improvements as well.andP;  Among them are newpaper-handling capabilities that let users handle rolls, fan fold, singlesheets and forms.andP;  Easier-to-use control panels have also appeared.andM;MORE SPEED, MORE MONEYandM;Prices for low- to mid-speed serial impact matrix printers that run at speedsof 240 characters per second (cps) or below range from $2999 to $3,261.andP;  Suchprices compare favorably with non-impact printers, which can cost $10,000 andup.andM;Prices tend to be dictated first by speed, followed closely by throughput.andO;Two models may run at the same speed, but if one is built to be rugged enoughfor long, unattended print runs, it will carry the higher price.andP;  The numberof wires on the print head and its rated life also contribute to price.andM;Maxtrix printers are especially popular for workstations and for individualuse in producing drafts and internal correspondence.andP;  They also also arefavorites in data processing environments, where documents must be churnedout for hours at mid to low speeds.andM;Buyers of DEC's new desktop products might find that dot matrix products fitthe bill for their printing needs.andP;  Although department page printers on anetwork will undoubtedly provide some of the needed hard copy, dot matrixprinters will handle most of the printing chores for personal computers andRISC/Ultrix-based workstations.andM;On the plus side, matrix printers can handle a range of tasks that no othersingle printer technology can.andP;  This includes printing both text andgraphics--albeit draft quality.andP;  Matrix printers are also highly reliable.andO;The print head contains most of the moving parts; thus, there are far fewerparts to break down compared with other printer technologies, such as laseror ion deposition.andM;On the minus side, dot matrix is plagued by inherent technological flaws.andO;Critics note that matrix printers are slower and noiser than laser printers,and run at speeds measured in characters per second rather than pages perminute.andM;In some cases, print quality is not as good as text from daisywheel or laserprinters.andM;Only nine months ago, 18-wire print heads rivaled 24-wire in popularity.andP;  Allthat changed with IBM's recent introduction of a 24-pin model, which&quot;solidafied the 24-wire as a standard,&quot; said Bob Fennell, a senior analyst atDataquest, a San Jose, Calif., market research company.andM;Interestingly, there is little difference between 18- and 24-wire printquality, Larry Jamieson, a Datek senior research analyst, said.andM;&quot;The quality is nearly as good with 18 wires as it is with 24 wires,&quot;Jamieson said.andP;  &quot;But users and resellers think that the 24-wire printer isthe one to have.andP;  It just has better market acceptance.&quot;andM;Others disagree, saying there are significant differences between the two.andO;Dennis Cox, product manager of impact printers for Epson America, forexample, pointed out that the 18-wire print head is really a derivative ofthe 9-wire one.andP;  Doubling the number of wires in the same basic configurationincreases speed, Cox said, but does not perceptibly improve the quality ofthe character.andM;Some contend that 18-wire printers are better suited than 24-wire printersfor printing multipart forms because they use thicker wires--wires that aretoo thin can tear paper.andP;  Also, many 18-wire models are built for ruggedenvironments, Dataquest's Fennell said, whereas 24-wire models are bettersuited to lighter-duty, personal applications.andM;Although analysts believe that the popularity of 24-wire printers spellstrouble for 9-wire models, some vendors contend that the latter printer'sreliability, price and speedy operation will ensure its longevity for thenext few years.andM;One big reason for the ongoing success of matrix printers--regardless of thenumber of wires--is their ability to print multipart forms--something thatlaser and other non-impact printers cannot do.andP;  Besides handling forms suchas invoices, matrix printers can handle more types and sizes of paper thanother printers--something that buyers like.andP;  The capacity to print envelopesis also widely available.andM;&quot;In the last six months we've seen an increased demand for paper-handlingcapabilities--rolls, fan fold, single sheets, forms,&quot; said Marc Liebesman,vice president of marketing management for C. Itoh.andP;  As a result, manymanufacturers have added sophisticated paper-handling features to even theirlowest-priced models to meet this demand.andM;A typical low-end laser printer has a paper cartridge that holds a maximum of500 cut sheets.andP;  In contrast, most matrix printers can accept tractor-feedpaper that comes in boxes of 2,500 or more.andP;  This capability lets DP users dolong, unattended print runs for applications such as invoicing.andM;A popular paper-handling feature that is becoming standard is the &quot;pushtractor.&quot;andP;  This device holds paper in such a way as to eliminate waste duringprinting.andM;The push tractor also makes it possible to do &quot;paper parking,&quot; which meansthat tractor feed paper can be held in readiness while cut sheets are beingprinted.andM;Paper-handling capabilities are improving to the degree that some believetractor feeds may soon become obsolete.andP;  According to a spokesman for aMannesmann-Talk Corp., the Kent, Wash.andP;  printer vendor whose products aren'tcurrently available for DEC environments, &quot;there are better and simpler waysto handle paper.&quot;andM;Some printers have a &quot;short-tear&quot; feature: Push a button and the paperadvances to a tearing position; push it again and the paper retracts to aprint position.andM;To increase versatility, many manufacturers include multiple paper-feedoptions.andP;  The Panasonic KX-P 1124 and KX-P 1191, for instance, both havebottom, rear and front paper loading.andP;  (Vendors say paper-loading needsdepend mostly on printer location, though bottom loading can be a betteroption for heavy paper stocks or thick multipart forms.)andM;Despite its historical reputation for unreadable characters, do matrixtechnology actually can deliver higher resolutions than some laser printers.andM;Dot matrix printers can produce resolutions of 360 dots per inch (dpi),whereas the typical laser output is 300 dpi.andP;  (However, dot matrix dots arebigger than laser dots and overlap.)andM;For versatile, high-quality text printing, &quot;font scaling&quot; can be important.andO;Scaling means, for example, that a 10-point type font can be scaled up ordown to provide the same type style in a variety of sizes.andP;  Problems developwhen enlarging a typeface, however.andP;  Fonts that are fuzzy at 12-point sizesmay in some cases be unreadable at 72 points.andP;  In general, the better thequality of the font, the easier it will scale into a large typeface.andM;Manufacturers are beginning to offer more fonts with their printers.andP;  Epsonoffers as many as seven fonts for some models, with additional fontsavailable on optional cartridges.andP;  The FX- and EX-800 Series printers (allunder $700) come with draft, roman and sans serif fonts in both 10- and12-point sizes.andM;&quot;The number of fonts is increasing on all classes of dot matrix products.andP;  Awide choice of fonts was formerly restricted to high-end products,&quot; Epson'sCox said.andM;In addition to performance gains in resolutions and fonts, today's generationof printers also offers an improved user interface on the control panel.andO;&quot;The average end user is not a software expert so we're allowing him tochoose font, pitch, form length and margins through the control panelinstead,&quot; explained Gary Bailer, product line manager of impact printers atPanasonic's Computer Products Division.andP;  &quot;You can still do it via software ifyou want: It's the Burger King approach--have it your way,&quot; he said.andM;Users no longer need to &quot;get inside the printer to set DIP switches,&quot;Dataquest's Fennell said.andP;  &quot;LEDs are being used to indicate modes and fonts.andO;Some manufacturers are even using sounds,&quot; he said.andP;  In addition to providinga series of buttons for selecting print characteristics, some printers alsodisplay a menu.andP;  The LQ-2550 from Epson America has a 20-character LCD forselecting print attributes.andM;Other than the serial interface, few features in impact matrix printerscomply with any written standards.andP;  There are, however, several de factorstandards such as common printer emulations (DEC LA50, LA75, LA210).andP;  Whilemanufacturers seem to be happy conforming to a loose set of de factostandards, analysts say that buyers could benefit from some more stringentregulations.andM;Even though the print quality from impact matrix printers has been improvingrapidly, buyers should be aware that the terms &quot;letter quality&quot; and&quot;near-letter quality&quot; are used at the will of the manufacturer.andM;NO STANDARDS YETandM;&quot;Go out, get some print samples and compare,&quot; C. Itoh's Liebesman said.andM;Epson's Cox said the terms are used to describe standard types of print.andO;&quot;Near-letter quality is the best print quality you can get from a 9-wireprinter while letter quality is the best from a 24-wire model,&quot; Cox said.andP;  Inany case, let the buyer beware: Comparing print samples should be the acidtest.andM;Speed ratings can also be misleading.andP;  The cps ratings advertised will varydepending on the mode and pitch used to achieve the speed.andP;  It's not that theinformation isn't available, but that users must read the specifications.andO;&quot;Read the fine print carefully.andP;  In some cases it's not an apples-to-applescomparison,&quot; Jamieson from Datek said.andM;Standards for speed ratings can be improved, said Rick Osgood, productmanager at Fortis Information Systems.andP;  In the absence of such a standard,however, buyers must carefully examine the specifications for themselves.andO;&quot;Average lines printed per minute is a better standard [than characters persecond],&quot; Osgood said.andP;  &quot;I want to know how long it's going to take to printa page.&quot;andM;Despite the trend toward 24-pin models, analysts and vendors say the marketwill probably not see a move toward increasing the number of wires in theprint head to 36 or 48 wires.andM;Forty-eight-wire-printers do exist in Japan, and Epson showcased a model inEurope last year.andP;  But Epson's Cox said he believes there is no such need fora printer in the U.S.andP;  market.andP;  In Japan, the greater number of pins serves apurpose--printing Japanese-language, or Kanji, characters.andP;  In the UnitedStates (and Europe), however, its value is more questionable.andM;The high price also makes it unlikely that a 48-wire model will be marketedhere in the near future.andP;  &quot;There would be no particular gain from a 36- or48-wire printer, and it certainly wouldn't be price-competitive,&quot; Datek'sJamieson said.andM;Color matrix printing remains largely a provocative promise.andP;  Currently,Epson, NEC, Toshiba, Okidata and other vendors market color impact matrixprinters.andP;  In the near future, buyers of serial dot matrix printers canexpect new color capabilities.andM;Color dot matrix printing is limited and slow because it takes multiplepasses to create color.andM;&quot;But you have to ask, slower than what?&quot;andP;  Cox of Epson America asked.andP;  &quot;Canyou produce a color transparency by hand faster?andP;  Can you print it on a colorlaser printer faster?andP;  The answer is no.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
