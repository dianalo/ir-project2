Bacon   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>01/30/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A4</SO><IN>BANKS (BNK)ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)</IN><GV>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FDL)TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE)CONGRESS (CNG)EXECUTIVE (EXE)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Although the bank deposit-insurance fund isnearing insolvency, Treasury loans and higher payments frombanks could rebuild the fund as it meets its obligations, theCongressional Budget Office said.   With banks failing because of recession and bad realestate loans, &quot;within a year or so, the fund will be out ofcash and insolvent without some form of cash or capitalinfusion,&quot; CBO Director Robert Reischauer told the SenateBanking Committee.</LP><TEXT>   Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), the panel's chairman, saidthat whatever temporary problems the fund encounters, &quot;it'simportant for people to know that their savings are insuredin federally insured institutions up to the $100,000 level.&quot;   The CBO's projection is the latest warning that the fundis facing insolvency. In response, the government and thebanking industry have started discussing ways to bolster thefund. Banks, which support the fund with premiums ondeposits, have vowed to replenish the fund without taxpayerassistance. Banks and members of Congress want to avoid ataxpayer bailout, which was used to protect deposits infailed savings-and-loan institutions.   The urgent need to rebuild the bank insurance fund hasemerged as a task that the government and banks mustaccomplish before Congress takes up the Bush administration'splan to restructure the banking industry. President Bushmentioned the need for a stronger banking system in his Stateof the Union Address last night, and the Treasury plans torelease a detailed proposal next week.   Mr. Reischauer suggested the fund borrow about $11 billionfrom the Treasury to get it through the wave of bank failuresexpected during the recession, which he expects to end bymidyear. At the same time, the premium that banks pay shouldrise in four steps to 30 cents per $100 of domestic depositsby Jan. 1, 1993, from the current 19.5 cents. The premiumswould be used to repay the loan, plus interest, by 1996, andthen rebuild the fund.   This plan is considerably simpler than some of theproposals the banking industry has been debating for the lasttwo weeks. However, it calls for steeper premium increasesthan many banks want to pay. &quot;They really are talking abouttaking a lot of money out of the industry&quot; at a time whenmany banks are working to build capital, said Diane Casey,executive director of the Independent Bankers Association ofAmerica.   Banking representatives have been meeting with WilliamSeidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., andTreasury officials in an effort to establish anearly-intervention fund to keep undercapitalized banks fromfailing and draining the deposit-insurance fund. But theplan, while attractive to many bankers in theory, facesseveral complex problems. One concern is how to encourage theconsolidation in the banking industry that many analysts andbankers think has to occur.   The American Bankers Association has scheduled a &quot;bankingsummit&quot; for Thursday to discuss how to recapitalize the fund.Mr. Seidman, Treasury officials and bankers from around thecountry will attempt to narrow their differences.   One of the reasons it has been difficult for the bankingindustry to agree on a plan is that strong banks arereluctant to put up money to support weak banks.   In his testimony, Mr. Reischauer said the nation has &quot;twoseparate banking industries.&quot; More than 11,000 banks of thenation's nearly 13,000 banks have equity-to-asset ratios ofmore than 6% and are making money. &quot;These banks account fornearly half of the industry's assets and show every sign ofbeing able to survive the recession,&quot; he said.   &quot;At the other end of the spectrum are fewer than 600 bankswith equity-to-asset ratios of less than 6% that reported netlosses for the first six months of 1990. These institutionsaccount for only about one-tenth of the industry's assets,and many of them are likely to fail by the end of 1993,&quot; hemaintained. He also said that a number of large banks arevulnerable to an economic downturn.   Separately, the comptroller of the currency issued anexpected bulletin encouraging 4,200 national banks todisclose more information on nonperforming loans. &quot;Thisinformation will improve understanding of the impact ofnonaccrual loans on a bank's financial condition,&quot; theTreasury agency said.</TEXT></DOC>
