ChipelloAnd Alan Freeman09/29/87WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)CANDA FLT GMOFFICE EQUIPMENT (OFF)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)SUPREME COURT (SUP)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)   It seems that Roger B. Smith, chairman of General Motors Corp., can't stay out of controversy these days. He was heckled by disgruntled shareholders at the annual meeting in May. He was booed by dissatisfied workers at a plant tour in July. And last month he strayed briefly from the onerous task of trying to turn around America's largest industrial corporation -- only to be jumped on once again.    Last month, Mr. Smith had an op-ed piece in this newspaper supporting the nomination of Judge Robert Bork to the U.S. Supreme Court. In the article, the GM chairman praised Mr. Bork for offering &quot;judicial restraint&quot; and &quot;less uncertainty&quot; in court cases.    The following week Automotive News, a weekly trade publication, blasted Mr. Smith for his &quot;remarkable foray into government and public affairs.&quot; The editorial noted Mr. Bork's history as a consultant to GM and the number of GM-related cases before the U.S. Court of Appeals on which Mr. Bork currently sits.    &quot;At best,&quot; the Automotive News piece concluded, &quot;the Smith endorsement taints any decisions Judge Bork might make in the future in which he sides with GM.&quot;    GM, for its part, responded with a statement arguing that &quot;pending litigation should not preclude responsible business leaders, or anyone else in this country, from speaking out on major issues that impact the quality of our lives, our government, or society.&quot;    Party Pooper   It may not be all that tough to take the fun out of being a banker. But Fleet Financial Group Inc. has found a new way: It plans an unconventional experiment in cost-cutting. Literally.    J. Terrence Murray, chairman and president of the Providence, R.I.-based company, has given notice that employees won't be sent to conventions next year. Afterwards, managers will be asked &quot;to say honestly&quot; whether keeping their specialists away from the annual get-togethers seemed to make any difference in performance.    Fleet figures convention fees cost the company about $250,000 a year, but that's just the beginning. Air fare, accommodations and dining out bring the bill to over $1 million, Mr. Murray reckons. &quot;I suspect a lot of it is a waste,&quot; he says.    The trial measure was decreed well in advance to forestall any grumbling about ruined plans. And there could be a lot of grumbling; as Mr. Murray notes, next year's annual convention of the American Bankers Association is scheduled for Hawaii.    Geography 101   Is there an Eternity in Quebec? Sharp Electronics Corp. thinks so, although you might have trouble finding it on a map.    To demonstrate the speed and range of its facsimile machines, Sharp has launched a newspaper advertising campaign with the theme &quot;From here to Eternity in eighteen seconds.&quot; Pictured in the ad is a picturesque village identified as Eternity, Quebec. The ad shows how a document can be transmitted in seconds from New York even to &quot;isolated Eternity (pop. 1,117), where some businessmen claim they're so backwoods that sunshine has to be faxed in.&quot;    But according to the Quebec agency responsible for geographical place-names, there is no Eternity, Quebec. The closest thing to it is Riviere Eternite, a village in the Saguenay River valley.    &quot;It's about as close as we could get to an Eternity situation,&quot; admits one Sharp official. Sandy Buchsbaum, president of Stevens andamp; Buchsbaum, the New York advertising agency responsible for the campaign, insists that residents of Riviere Eternite occasionally shorten the name to just Eternite.    But Denis Houde, the village secretary, disputes that. He says the name is never shortened to Eternite, let alone the English equivalent, Eternity. And he says the village has 680 inhabitants, not 1,117.    Odds andamp; Ends   They can't sell, but can they hit: Biogen Inc., a Cambridge-based genetic engineering firm that has consistently lost money, won the championship of the 15-team Boston Biotech Softball League. . . . Beam me up, Leo. Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's executive committee, is widely considered the father of financial futures trading. He looks even farther into the future in his first novel, &quot;The Tenth Planet,&quot; a new science fiction yarn. </TEXT></DOC>
