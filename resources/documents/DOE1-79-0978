These metabolites are synthesized whenactive growth ceases in response to the depletion of one of the constituentsof the medium. The appearance of these metabolites represents the transcriptionand translation of a part of the genome of the organism which is 'dormant'during the phase of active vegetative growth. The genetic control ofthis aspect of microbial secondary metabolism is very complex. However,during the last ten years many important advances have been made in microbialgenetics, both in our understanding of the mechanisms of genetics atthe molecular level and in new techniques for gene manipulation thathave enabled workers in the field of antibiotics research to considersome of the fundamental questions relating to the problem. One of thehandicaps with many antibiotic-producing organisms is our lack of a formalgenetic knowledge. With the new methods and approaches, it is hoped thatthis situation will be changed. Several reviews of the genetics and regulationof antibiotic production have been published in the last few years andit is the authors' intention to concentrate on the genetic systems availablein antibiotic-producing organisms and the manner in which they have beenused in both fundamental and empirical work.</TEXT></DOC>
