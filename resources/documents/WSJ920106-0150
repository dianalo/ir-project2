It has been aheavy burden. Both Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis ranvowing to eliminate Mr. Reagan's red ink. Neither was able tosell that sour medicine to a public averse to pain.   This year will be different. Granted, the deficit isbigger than ever: an estimated $350 billion this fiscal year.But much has changed since 1988. The prolonged recession hasled to rising public demands for government action. Slowgrowth has heightened awareness of the gap between haves andhave-nots. And the collapse of the Soviet empire has createdpromises of a pot of gold, perhaps as much as $150 billion ayear, at the end of the defense-cutting rainbow.   As a result, the Democratic candidates are no longerparalyzed by the deficit issue. For voters unhappy withPresident Bush's passive approach to the economy, the sixmain contenders for the Democratic nomination offer asmorgasbord of proposals. There are tax cuts for the middleclass; tax incentives for investment and savings; tax breaksfor families with children; and spending on health,education, roads, high-speed transportation, high-techtelecommunications and much more.   &quot;They are all much more willing in 1992 to talk aboutgovernment responsibility for the economy than either Dukakisor Mondale,&quot; says Jeff Faux, president of the liberalEconomic Policy Institute.   Focusing the candidates' discussion of economic policy arethree separate questions: How can the government get theeconomy out of recession in the near term? How can it restoreAmerican growth and competitiveness in the long term? And howcan it address the concerns of middle-class Americans whofeel squeezed?   So far, the most popular answer is the middle-class taxcut; it is embraced, in some form, by four of the sixcandidates: Govs. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Doug Wilder ofVirginia, Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and former Gov. JerryBrown of California. But while the candidates talk a lotabout it, they have little that's convincing to say about howit would help the economy. And despite the obvious voterappeal of such cuts, two candidates -- Sen. Tom Harkin ofIowa and former Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts -- opposethe idea, from opposite ends of the spectrum.   Mr. Harkin's solution to both short-term and long-termeconomic problems comes from advisers who are unreconstructeddisciples of the late John Maynard Keynes: more governmentspending, on everything from education to developing electriccars. Quoting liberal economist Robert Heilbroner, Mr. Harkinsays: &quot;Without an adequate infrastructure, private industrycannot live up to its potential.&quot; Among the Democraticcandidates, he expresses the least concern about the budgetdeficit. Mr. Tsongas, meanwhile, favors &quot;strategic&quot;government investments in technology and targeted tax cutsfor investment -- including a capital-gains cut.   In the middle are Messrs. Clinton and Kerrey. Mr. Clintonhas the more clearly articulated economic strategy. To combatrecession now, he would cut middle-class taxes 10%, speed uphighway spending, provide more benefits to the unemployed andexpand Federal Housing Administration loan guarantees. Toaddress long-term problems, he favors an investment taxcredit, a targeted capital-gains tax cut for investments innew businesses, and more government spending on civilianresearch.   Mr. Kerrey puts less emphasis on his middle-class tax-cutproposal, saying it &quot;might provide some stimulus, but itsmain purpose would be to return some equity to the tax code.&quot;Instead, his economic message rests on a proposal to overhaulthe health-care system -- the cornerstone of his campaign --as well as on a plan to streamline government (borrowed fromHouse Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta of California)and on increased spending for education, technology andcommunications. Mr. Wilder combines his tax-cut proposal withbroad but general calls for government spending reductions.Mr. Brown offers even fewer specifics on what his policieswould be.   Here is a guide to the Democratic candidates' views oneconomic policy:                                                                                                          Taxes                                                                                                          A tax cut for the middle class has become an importantsymbol for many Democrats. &quot;It's a metaphor,&quot; says ScottLilly, executive director of the congressional DemocraticStudy Group. &quot;Democrats have been so preoccupied with theproblems of the underclass that we haven't put as muchemphasis on the middle class as we should have. We need asignal to show we have gotten the message.&quot;   Mr. Clinton's version calls for a cut of about $350 a yearfor middle-class taxpayers. &quot;You can't build consumerconfidence without cash,&quot; he says. To address broader issuesof the nation's &quot;loss of economic growth and world economicleadership,&quot; he also supports a grab bag of tax credits forinvestment, child care and the working poor; a reduction inthe capital-gains tax to account for inflation; and atargeted capital-gains tax cut for investments in newbusinesses held more than five years.   Economists question how his middle-class tax cut, whichwould raise taxes on upper-income Peter to pay middle-classPaul, could stimulate the economy. But Mr. Clinton's advisersargue that the middle class provides the engine of consumerspending, and say their plan would boost consumer confidence.   To pay for all these, he'd propose a 3% across-the-boardcut in all government administrative expenses -- a proposalthat's popular among politicians seeking office, but seldompractical once they get there. And like the other candidates,he'd seek further cuts in defense spending.   The other candidate who has put tax cuts at the heart ofhis campaign is Mr. Wilder. He calls both for an immediate$35 billion tax cut and for bringing &quot;a new fiscal disciplineto Washington.&quot; But doing both is no easy trick.   The Virginia governor's claim to legitimacy in thepresidential race is that he closed his state's budget gapwithout raising taxes. But his plans for doing the same atthe federal level are more than a little hazy. He calls for a10% cut in vague &quot;administrative overhead,&quot; for an annualsavings of $25 billion, plus $15 billion in cuts in&quot;low-priority&quot; programs. Just how to get the money out ofoverhead, or which programs are low-priority, is unclear.   Mr. Kerrey's middle-class tax cut, like Mr. Clinton's,would be paid for by higher taxes on the wealthy. It wouldhelp &quot;middle-income Americans struggling to build theirfutures, and restore faith in our economic system,&quot; he says.   Mr. Brown's position is the least clear. He complains thatmany people making $30,000 to $40,000 a year are in a 43% taxbracket, counting Social Security taxes; he favors combiningSocial Security and income taxes and then reducing theoverall rate. But for the most part, his economic policy isjust a variation on his basic campaign theme that moneyedinterested have corrupted the political system.                                                                                                          Spending and Investment                                                                                                          A link between Mr. Harkin and Mr. Tsongas is that bothemphasize investment spending, rather than consumer spending,as the key to economic solutions. But their approaches toinvestment could hardly be more different.   Mr. Tsongas, more than any of the other candidates,focuses on the slow economic erosion caused by deficits. Hisplan is to shore up the private sector, so that privatecompanies will invest more readily. He would encourage themthrough tax incentives and through &quot;strategic&quot; investments intechnology. His plan for &quot;an investment-led recovery,&quot; likeMr. Clinton's, calls for accelerating the spending under thetransportation bill. But instead of cutting the middleclass's taxes, he seeks a temporary investment tax credit.   For the longer term, Mr. Tsongas, like President Bush,favors a lower tax rate on capital gains. But he would limitthe tax break to investments in stock, and he would provide alower tax rate for long-held investments. He'd also easeantitrust laws to make joint research projects easier to do.And he would eliminate quarterly Securities and ExchangeCommission filings, so that companies would be less compelledto focus on short-term performance.   Mr. Harkin, rather than cajole the private sector intoinvesting more, would have the government spend directly --on roads and bridges, repairing airports, highspeed trains,faster and higher-flying aircraft, electric cars, automatedhighways, high-tech mass transit, renewable energy andtelecommunications. In a speech in October to Mr. Faux'sEconomic Policy Institute, which is funded largely by laborgroups, Mr. Harkin used the word &quot;infrastructure&quot; no lessthan 15 times.   The Iowa senator would pay for this government largess bycutting defense spending. &quot;We can maintain the most powerful,modern, high-tech military in the world . . . and still cutour military budget by 50% over the next 10 years,&quot; he says.But it's clear Mr. Harkin has heeded the argument of Mr. Fauxand others who say concerns about the deficit should take aback seat to raising public investment.   Many of the spending plans Mr. Harkin envisions on a grandscale are echoed on a smaller scale in speeches by Mr. Kerreyand Mr. Clinton. Mr. Kerrey, for instance, advocates a&quot;billion-dollar educational capital fund&quot; to spark localinnovation. He would create a new agency, modeled after thePentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa),to fund civilian research enhancing &quot;not our militarysecurity, but our economic and financial security.&quot; And hewould commit the federal government to creating a&quot;state-of-the-art communications system that will move usfrom the age of the dial tone to the age of information.&quot;   Mr. Clinton also favors a civilian Darpa, and he calls fora federal budget that invests more &quot;in the future&quot; -- inareas like education, children's health, environmentaltechnology and infrastructure and basic research. At the sametime, he says the government should spend less on &quot;currentconsumption.&quot; (The government's biggest program that feedscurrent consumption is Social Security, but Mr. Clintondoesn't say he would cut it.)                                                                                                          Monetary Policy                                                                                                          Because monetary policy is made by the Federal Reserve,which is at least partly independent of President Bush, theDemocratic contenders have spent relatively little timeattacking interest-rate policies. All of them would beinclined to appoint Fed members who would favor easier creditthan the Fed has pursued under Alan Greenspan. But Mr. Harkinis the most unequivocal advocate of easier money. &quot;Bush keepscomplaining about the high interest rate,&quot; he said this fall,&quot;yet he's the one who just reappointed Alan Greenspan.&quot;   Mr. Tsongas also calls on the Fed to lower interest rates,saying that recent cuts &quot;haven't worked since rates are stilltoo high in relation to inflation.&quot;   Mr. Kerrey has occasionally seemed to pin the primaryblame for the recession on the Fed, calling on it in onespeech to &quot;help bring the economy out of the recession itcreated.&quot; He also called on banks &quot;to pass those reducedrates to American investors and consumers,&quot; a point Mr.Clinton focuses on as well.   Rather than calling on the Fed for further action, Mr.Clinton says the president should force bank regulators toease the credit crunch by encouraging banks to make goodloans at lower rates. And while President Bush has backed offof his ad-libbed call for lower interest rates on creditcards, Mr. Clinton continues to advocate the idea.</TEXT></DOC>
