<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-16-1079 </DOCNO><TEXT>A family of Zr{sub 5}Sb{sub 3}Z compounds, Z = C, O, Al, Si, P, S, Fe,Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Se, have been synthesized in the Mn{sub 5}Si{sub3} structure. The Z element occupies the center of confacial trigonalantiprisms of zirconium atoms. Antimony can also occupy the interstitialsite, and the binary compound has a homogeneity range Zr{sub 5}Sb/sub3.0/ to Zr{sub 5}Sb/sub 3.4/. The compounds were mainly prepared by arc-meltingor powder sintering. Temperatures in excess of 1100{sup 0}C were neededto provide adequate reaction rates for the sintering experiments. Isothermalvapor transport reactions, 1100 andless; T andless; 1300{sup 0}C, with iodine as atransporting agent were used to ensure complete reaction, but providedno single crystals. Reactions using Zn or In as a solvent yielded singlecrystals. Reactions using Zn or In as a solvent yielded single crystalsof a size suitable for physical property measurements. Structural refinementswere carried out for the compounds Zr{sub 5}Sb{sub 3}Al, Zr{sub 5}Sb{sub3}Si, Zr{sub 5}Sb{sub 3}S, Zr{sub 5}Sb{sub 3}Fe, Zr{sub 5}Sb{sub 3}(Fe/sub2/3/In/sub 1/3/). Extended-Hueckel band calculations were carried outon Zr{sub 5}Sb{sub 3}, Zr{sub 5}Sb{sub 3}S, and Zr{sub 5}Sb{sub 3}Fein order to rationalize the ability of Zr{sub 5}Sb{sub 3} to interstitiallyincorporate this remarkable array of chemically diverse elements.</TEXT></DOC>
