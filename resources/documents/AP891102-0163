The plan, the product of nearly eight weeks of wrangling betweenHouse and Senate conferees, provides much of Bush's request forland-based nuclear missiles and restores some funds for twoconventional-arms programs the president sought to kill.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he was ``generally pleased''with the bill because it ``authorizes funds for effectivemodernization of our strategic forces.'' He expressed somedisappointment, however, over the cut in the SDI request.   ``I would have preferred a higher level of funding for SDI,''the defense secretary, in Australia for bilateral talks, said in astatement released by the Pentagon.   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the ArmedServices Committee, said he expects the president to sign the billonce it passes the House and Senate.   ``Apart from SDI, on the whole it's one which we findacceptable,'' Warner said of the bill.   The legislation provides $3.57 billion for SDI, popularly knownas Star Wars, in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 _ about $200million less than the amount spent in fiscal 1989 and the firstdecrease in funds since former President Reagan proposed theanti-missile shield six years ago.   Adding $220 million for related Energy Department programs, thefinal total for Star Wars is $3.79 billion, which falls between the$2.8 billion approved by the House and the $4.3 billion adopted bythe Senate.   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,said the cut in Star Wars spending reflected diminishingcongressional support for a program whose mission the Bushadministration has not defined.   ``They've changed the program so many times and the architecturehas never been really a fixed architecture, by that I mean the planand how they're going to use it,'' Nunn told reporters.   Despite the overall agreement, there still were complaints fromlawmakers about the package.   ``We're buying too many big-ticket items with no hard choices,''said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, a member of the House Armed ServicesCommittee who complained aobut the restoration of funds for theV-22 Osprey and the F-14D jet fighter.   ``What we have to show for weeks of wheeling and dealing inconference is an outrageous compromise corrupted by political andparochial avarice,'' said Rep. Larry J. Hopkins, R-Ky.   The negotiators' agreement, which still must be approved by thefull House and Senate, includes approximately $1.1 billion for therail-based MX multiple-warhead missile and the truck-basedMidgetman single-warhead missile, about $150 million less than Bushhad requested for the two nuclear weapons.   Cheney had favored financing only the MX, but Bush opted for thetwo land-based missiles, with $1.1 billion for the MX and $100million for the Midgetman.   The bill also includes House language imposing a 50-missile capon the MX.   The budget for the MX and Midgetman drew complaints Wednesdayfrom four House members, including three chairmen of Armed Servicessubcommittees.   ``We feel that the proposed deal on the B-2, Strategic DefenseInitiative and mobile ICBMs is inadequate and we cannot sign theconference report in its present form,'' the four said in a letterto Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed Services panel.   Signing the letter were Reps. Charles Bennett, D-Fla. andchairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee on seapower andstrategic and critical materials; Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo. andchairman of the subcommittee on military installations andfacilities; Ronald Dellums, D-Calif. and chairman of thesubcommittee on research and development; and Lane Evans, D-Ill.and a member of the full panel.   The agreement also provides funds for two B-2 stealth bombers infiscal 1990, one less than the Bush administration proposed, andmoney for components for five in fiscal 1991. The bat-wingedaircraft has come under congressional criticism in the last yearfor its expensive price tag of $530 million apiece.   The negotiators agreed to restore some money for the twoconventional-arms programs Bush sought to cancel _ the MarineCorps' Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the Navy's F-14D Tomcat.   The Osprey, an aircraft that takes off like a helicopter but canfly like a plane, will receive about $255 million in research anddevelopment money but no funds for procurement. The future of theprogram would be tied to commercial use of the plane.   The legislation also includes a provision calling for thepurchase of 18 F-14D fighters in fiscal 1990 but none in fiscal1991, a decision which is viewed by many lawmakers as a ``goldenparachute'' for the manufacturer, Grumman Corp., of New York.   While the future of the Osprey rests with commercialapplication, the bill requires Grumman to sign a contract to endfuture production of the F-14D, referred to by Warner as a ``poisonpill.''</TEXT></DOC>
