In his proposed budget for fiscal 1990, Reagan asked for $5.034billion for the law enforcement, prevention and treatment agenciesengaged in the war on drugs. That reflects a $633 million increaseover the $4.401 billion to be spent this fiscal year.   Asked if the increase is enough to tell the American people thatthe administration is serious about a war on drugs, Deputy AttorneyGeneral Harold G. Christensen told reporters, ``I think that thisprogram, given the constraints, does address that problem.''   John C. Lawn, administrator of the Drug EnforcementAdministration, said that while the total increase for the JusticeDepartment in the proposed budget is 7 percent, ``the increase forthe Drug Enforcement Administration, in real money, is 13 percent.''   ``I think this clearly gives the message that drug lawenforcement remains a priority of this government and thisadministration,'' Lawn said.   The DEA would add 275 foreign and domestic positions and would beexpected to increase arrests by more than 1,100 in the 1990 fiscalyear beginning next Oct. 1, according to budget documents.   FBI Director William S. Sessions said his agency's strategy ``isaligned purely to go after major drug trafficking and moneylaundering organizations and heroin and cocaine.   ``So with us, every incremental increase means that we can attackthat many more organizations,'' he said, referring to a proposed $12million boost in FBI spending on drugs next year.   When the FBI received $15 million more as a result of the 1986drug bill, Sessions said the agency was able to mount attacks on anaddtional 5 percent to 10 percent of the approximately 450 majordrug trafficking organizations.   Reagan requested a total of $3.49 billion in fiscal 1990 for lawenforcement in the drug wars, including $3.5 million in outlays forthe office of the new drug czar.   Once appointed, whoever holds that position will also be incontrol of up to $136 million in forfeitures of property seized indrug-related cases.   The budget requests also seeks $915.3 million in fiscal 1990expenditures on drug abuse prevention and $633.2 million fortreatment programs, according to an administration official.   Within the law enforcement category, drug interdiction effortswould receive the largest allocation _ $1.22 billion.   Spending on corrections facilities to house drug offenders wouldtotal $722.3 million. Investigations would receive $716.4 million;prosecutions, $306.7 million, and international programs, $238.3million.   Reagan is seekikng $415 million for the U.S. Customs Service to``greatly expand the number of intensive examinations of high-riskcontainerized cargo shipments,'' the budget documents said.   The Coast Guard, meanwhile, would get an additional $47 millionto finance two surveillance aircraft and two land-based balloons forspotting drug smugglers, according to the documents.   The government said the addition of 940 positions proposed forthe U.S. attorney offices nationwide is expected to increase thenumber of drug prosecutions in 1990 by 3,600 cases. In addition,money has been requested to fund 6,685 new prison and jail bedspaces as well as leasing authority for 1,160 more.
