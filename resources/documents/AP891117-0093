Should the fearsome penalties of the Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organizations Act, so successful in the government's war onorganized crime, be used against criminals of the financial world?   ``Honest businessmen have nothing to fear from the RICO law,''said Michael Goldsmith, a Brigham Young University law professor.   Instead of worrying about RICO, with its stiff penalties andthreat of asset forfeiture, ``Wall Street ought to be saying,`Let's come up with a remedy to our problems with fraud,'''Goldsmith said.   Added Joseph diGenova, former U.S. attorney for the District ofColumbia: ``No one seems to have a problem with applying RICO tothe Colombo (organized crime) family or the Genovese (organizedcrime) family. They do have a problem, apparently, applying RICO topeople whose names don't end in vowels.''   Passed by Congress in 1970, RICO was designed to make it easierfor prosecutors to root out mobsters by attacking seeminglylegitimate businesses associated with organized crime.   Prosecutors can win a RICO conviction with unrelated crimes suchas loansharking or mail fraud if they can convince a jury thosecharged were linked through a ``pattern of racketeering activity.''The law did not define any new crimes.   Defendants convicted of RICO violations are subject to maximumpenalties of up to 20 years in prison, hundreds of thousands ofdollars in fines and possible forfeiture of illegal profits intothe millions.   It is RICO's forfeiture provisions that have caused most of theuproar. Through them, prosecutors can obtain temporary restrainingorders to freeze a defendant's assets before trial to ensure thefunds are available in the event a jury orders them forfeited aspart of a verdict.   Opponents of the law say it has been turned into a club to scaredefendants into plea bargains and cooperation agreements.   ``It gives prosecutors a terrifying weapon,'' said AlanBromberg, a securities law expert at Southern Methodist University.``I'm not sure our justice system should be getting people to pleadguilty when they don't feel they're guilty.''   The case of Princeton-Newport Partners LP involved the first useof the law against securities professionals. Last week, a federaljudge sentenced the six defendants to prison sentences of sixmonths or less.   While the case achieved convictions, the prison time imposed wasminimal and the judge also reversed the jury's forfeiture verdictagainst four defendants, ruling the harshness of the penalty didnot match the gravity of the crimes.   The jury had awarded $3.8 million of the $21 million sought byprosecutors in forfeitures.   Rather than confirm the effectiveness of RICO in the prosecutionof securities cases, the judge's actions only highlighted theproblems inherent in the tactic.   Defense lawyers contend the government's initial demands for anorder freezing the firm's assets, even though it was not chargedwith wrongdoing, destroyed Princeton-Newport's ability to raisemoney and forced it out of business.   In response to such criticisms, the Justice Department recentlyissued new guidelines for freezing RICO defendants' assets and alsosharply limited the use of racketeering charges in tax cases.   The underlying crime charged in Princeton-Newport was mail fraudfor a phony stock-trading scheme to generate bogus tax losses.   The Justice Department's tax division has since warnedprosecutors that Congress did not include tax offenses in the RICOstatute ``and charging a tax offense as a mail-fraud charge couldbe viewed as circumventing congressional intent unless uniquecircumstances'' exist.   ``What could be more telling of the abusive nature of thecharges than the new Justice Department guidelines that therecannot be another Princeton-Newport case?'' asked Paul Grand, adefense attorney at the trial.   Bruce Baird, former head of the securities fraud unit in theManhattan U.S. attorney's office that prosecuted Princeton-Newport,said the case complied with guidelines in place at the time chargeswere brought.   In addition, he said, Princeton-Newport's assets were neveractually frozen. The firm failed, he believes, because of theindictment itself _ not the battle over the assets.   But Gerald Lefcourt, another defense lawyer in the case, saidthat until a judge approved a bond to guarantee the defendants'funds, the whole firm's assets were under a cloud.   ``That's like restraining General Motors because the governmentwants your 1,000 shares,'' he said.   The racketeering law was used most prominently as a basis forindicting some of the 48 people charged in Chicago's commoditiespits as well as former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond chiefMichael Milken. Total forfeitures against Milken and twoco-defendants could approach $12 billion.   Drexel, then the nation's fifth-largest securities firm, lastyear said it agreed to plead guilty to six felony charges and pay$650 million in fines and restitution to avoid a racketeeringindictment that could have frozen its assets and crippled itsoperations.   ``There's no question RICO is effective,'' SMU's Bromberg said,``but steamrollers are effective, too.''   G. Robert Blakey, a University of Notre Dame law professor andone of the architects of the RICO statute, said Drexel may havelost far more if it had been convicted of racketeering.   ``Drexel got a good deal _ just like a street offender who pleabargains,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
