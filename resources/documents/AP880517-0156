LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>KWANGJU, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eight years after the bloodiestcivil uprisings in South Korea's modern history, residents of thissouthern city are pressing for a full accounting of the deathsresulting from government force used against protesters.   At least 191 people died and more than 800 others were injuredwhen the government deployed the army to crush a pro-democracydemonstration in this opposition stronghold in May 1980.   Now, thousands of people from various parts of the country makepilgrimages to Kwangju's Mangwoldong Cemetery, where the victimsare buried.   A mile-long road leading to the cemetery was neatly paved forthis year's anniversary and city authorities installed pay phonesand supplied drinking water for visitors.   Encouraged by an opposition victory in last month's legislativeelections, many of Kwangju's 800,000 citizens are in a hopeful moodbefore the anniversary of the uprising on Wednesday.   ``I am proud of Kwangju. In the long end, we are beginning tohave some breathing space,'' said Kim Soon-il, a shop owner.   Kim and many others plan to close their businesses to mark theday.   But the mood is marred by clashes between police and thousandsof dissident students, who are staging anti-government protests.They believe newly elected President Roh Tae-Woo and other topleaders, who were army generals at the time of the 1980 uprising,are responsible for the harsh military operations that resulted inthe high casualty toll.   The dissidents continue to claim that the death toll from 1980is much higher than the government officially reported and demandpunishement of those responsible for it.   Roh's government, which succeeded former President ChunDooh-hwan on Feb. 25, has promised to begin a month-long reviewstarting Monday into reports that many victims have not beenaccounted for.   During seven years of rule under Chun, the citizens of Kwangjuwere considered political outcasts, whom the regime labeled``rioter or impure elements.''   ``We are glad to have our honor back at long last,'' said LeeDal-sun, 35, a businessman. ``We need a full accounting of theincident more than anything else.''   Roh also has promised to financially help Kwangju victims anderect a monument dedicated to their ``democratization efforts.''   ``Financial compensation may be important but more important isthe restoration of honor,'' said Kim Yong-an, 31, who limps fromgunshot wounds in the riots.   But radical students at Kwangju's state-run Chonam Universitysay there is no compromise with the Roh government, which they sayis no better than its military-run predecessor.   ``We should not let down our guards. We must continue fightagainst the military dictatorship,'' said a student leader, whorequested anonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
