These southern ports would presumably be out ofrange of potential Iraqi air or missile attacks.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SAUDIS WEIGH PLAN TO SHUTTLE THEIR CRUDEOIL TO SAFE PORTS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The sources say Saudi Arabia has been working on detailed contingency plansto keep its oil flowing even if war starts after the Jan. 15 deadline set bythe U.N. for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.;    Saudi Arabia is said to beproducing about 8.4 million barrels a day of crude, of which about 6.5 millionis exported through its gulf terminals.;    Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazerchaired a joint meeting of Saudi Aramco and Samarec in Dhahran on Sunday toreview contingency plans for the oil industry, according to oil sources in thekingdom.;    Shipping sources say one potential problem is that tanker ownersare increasingly reluctant to commit their vessels to load at the Saudi portsof Ras Tanura, Juaymah and Jubail.;    Saudi Arabia is also expected to makemore use of the 800-kilometer petroline pipeline that carries Saudi crude fromthe oilfields along the gulf to the Red Sea export terminal at Yanbu, well outof range of Iraqi attack.;    Industry sources say the line has been usedlittle for crude exports since the start of the gulf crisis because pipelinecosts make it cheaper to load crude from Ras Tanura.;    At present, the Yanbupipeline is mainly used to carry an estimated 600,000 barrels a day of Arablight crude to the West Coast oil refineries at Jeddah and Rabigh.;    SaudiAramco is hoping that all its oil fields are sufficiently protected to allowcontinued operation during a war, gulf oil sources say. But some believe thatthe offshore Safaniya, Marjan and Zuluf fields may be shut down early in anymilitary conflict.;    The fields, which are within 100 kilometers of theSaudi-Kuwaiti border, produce a combined 2.5 million barrels a day, withSafaniya alone producing 1.5 million.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Dow Jones  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Manama, Bahrain  </CITY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910111  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  16D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  392  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, January 11, 199100011125,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
