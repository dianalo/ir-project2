In a suit filed in federal district court in San Diego, the shareholder, Emmanuel Liebman, alleges that Cubic used two defense consultants, William Galvin and Donald Illeman, to obtain secret information about the bidding process for the contract and provided the consultants with funds to pay bribes. The company won the contract for the &quot;Top Gun&quot; air combat training system in 1987.    Cubic Corp.'s chief executive officer, Walter Zable, called the lawsuit &quot;frivolous in nature,&quot; and said it contains &quot;completely unsubstantiated allegations. There is no basis whatsoever for the charges.&quot;    Mr. Galvin's lawyer, William D. Nussbaum, said he hadn't yet seen the complaint and would have no comment. Efforts to reach Mr. Illeman were unsuccessful.    The suit names the company's top executives, directors and the two consultants as defendants and accuses them of violating federal racketeering and securities laws, as well as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It doesn't specify monetary damages, although under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, any damages awarded would be tripled.    According to the suit, &quot;Cubic is likely to face huge expenses, large fines, debarment from government contracting, and other penalties for its illegal conduct. As a result of all of this, Cubic has been significantly damaged.&quot;    William Lerach, a prominent shareholder's attorney in San Diego who represents Mr. Liebman, said the Cubic suit is the first of several shareholder derivative actions he is planning to file as an outgrowth of the current Pentagon procurement scandal.    Mr. Lerach has been monitoring the investigation for clients considering shareholder suits against several large defense contractors, including Northrop Corp. Mr. Lerach said another lawsuit will probably be filed as soon as next week.    The lawsuit against Cubic provides no details about who might have received bribes from company executives or their consultants. Cubic's offices in San Diego were searched by federal authorities last June and, according to the complaint, several officers of the company have been subpoenaed by the grand jury investigating the Pentagon case. Mr. Galvin and Mr. Illeman are also subjects of the federal investigation. No charges have been filed against any company or individual connected with the investigation. </TEXT></DOC>
