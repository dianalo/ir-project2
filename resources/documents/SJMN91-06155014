Lenders and mortgage brokers are ranked based on the lowest annualpercentage rates they offer, but consumers should be aware that the APR maynot determine the best loan for them. To get a broad sample of widelyavailable loans, Mortgage News Co. surveys active retail lenders and mortgagebrokers in Santa Clara, Alameda, San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties. Retaillenders make loans with their own funds, and brokers, licensed by theCalifornia Department of Real Estate, make loans with money from wholesalesources. All rates were good as of press time and are subject to changewithout notice. Here are three tips when loan shopping: Know what loan typebest fits your needs, sample several lenders and brokers, make sure all termsand guarantees are in writing.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business Monday  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MORTGAGE RATES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Chartwatch  </MEMO><TEXT>  APR, or annual percentage rate, is the cost of the loan over the life of themortgage. So you can compare loans, Mortgage News Co. has calculated an APRbased on a specific loan amount, the points, the rate and an average fee of$700 that many lenders charge for a variety of services, including processingthe application and appraisal. The loan amounts are $191,250 for smallermortgages and $250,000 for bigger mortgages. Because lenders calculate theirAPRs differently and your loan amount and fees will vary, the APR that you paywill differ from the APRs listed here. (For adjustable mortgages, the APR isbased on the start rate and the current index rate plus the margin.) All loanslisted have a minimum 30-day lock-in period, generally meaning that when youapply for the loan, the rate will be good for at least 30 days.;  Points are aone-time fee paid to a lender for making the loan. One point is equal to 1percent of the loan amount.; Start rate is the initial interest rate paid onan adjustable-rate mortgage, usually set artificially low to attractconsumers. Depending on which ARM you choose, the start rate lasts from threemonths to one year, then the rate is adjusted.; Index determines how much anARM adjusts. 11D andequals; 11th District Cost of Funds; 6TB andequals; Six-month Treasury billaverage; 1TB andequals; One-year Treasury bill average; PRI andequals; Prime rate; 1LB andequals;One-month London Interbank Offered Rate average. The indices are in The MoneyMarket chart on the facing page.; Margin, a set amount expressed as apercentage, is added to the index to determine your new adjustable rate.;Adjustment period is how often the interest rate on an ARM is changed. 1M andequals;one month; 6M andequals; six months; 1Y andequals; one year.; Cap is the maximum percentage aninterest rate can rise during the adjustment period. A zero means that themonthly payment, not the interest rate, has a periodic cap. In the event thatmonthly payments do not meet interest costs, the difference will be added tothe loan's principal, a practice known as negative amortization.; Maximum rateis the highest interest rate the consumer could pay over the life of theloan.; Mortgage News Co. is an information service and does not make loans orbroker them. The information provided is not an offer to make a loan.Qualifications for borrowing vary among lenders, who generally offer otherloans, too. The lenders, the Mercury News and Mortgage News Co. cannot be heldresponsible for errors in information or rate changes.; MORTGAGE BROKERS;Fixed rate mortgages30-year loans of $191,250 or less;                                          Max.
