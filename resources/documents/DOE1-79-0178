Alternative viewpoints are categorized into atypology that is used to describe the conceptual nature of European beliefsand to measure the level of public support for the different viewpoints.Long-term trends in these attitudes and causal determinants are alsoexamined. A distinguishing feature of this study is that it is trulycomparative. The analysis relies on identical survey items administeredin four European countries: Great Britain, France, West German, and Italy.The longitudinal data examined indicate that some fundamental changeshave occurred in European security beliefs. Anti-Americanism has increaseddramatically at the same time that attitudes toward the Soviet Unionhave become more favorable, and the fear of nuclear weapons and nuclearwar has increased substantially. Explanations for these shifts in opinionare not found in sociological factors, such as changes in generationalexperiences, educational levels, or social classes; but instead, Europeanattitudes appear to reflect broad changes in international politics,such as the Vietnam War, nuclear parity, and detente. Favorable opinionfor NATO tends to be high, yet specific defense-related measures receivemuch less support.</TEXT></DOC>
