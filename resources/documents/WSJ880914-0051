We are wondering what the world thinks it is going to do if it concludes that the Iraqis did gas the Kurds.    The U.S., Britain, West Germany, Japan, Italy and France have urged Secretary General Perez de Cuellar of the U.N. to send, immediately, an investigating team to Iraq and Turkey. The request follows a Security Council resolution August 26 that among other things condemned the use of chemical weapons in the Gulf war, urged the Secretary General to promptly investigate such charges, and take &quot;appropriate and effective measures&quot; in case of further violations.    Iraq has admitted using gas against the Iranians but denies using it against the Kurds. Some preliminary investigators say they haven't seen evidence of gassings. Yet a strong circumstantial case for the gas attacks has been developing since the March gas attack on the village of Halabja, in which 4,000 died. The U.S. State Department is standing by its recent assertion of Iraqi gas attacks, but as usual declines to reveal the sources of its intelligence. The refugees themselves charge that in the post-cease-fire assault more than 2,000 have died and 5,000 were wounded, largely from the gas attacks. About 100,000 Kurds -- a people not previously known for running -- have fled across the border to Turkey to escape the onslaught.    In any event, the air is now filling with condemnations. Back before the cease-fire, the U.N. condemned Iraq for using chemical weapons against Iran. Amnesty International has been making its own charges against Iraq on similar grounds. The American Senate voted economic sanctions against Iraq. But many apparently feel more evidence is needed.    So the world now awaits a U.N. decision about when and where to field its inquiry. But, of course, Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, must first be consulted. There will be laboratory results of victims examined in Turkey, a country that wants to discourage more Kurds from fleeing to its territory and to avoid antagonizing its neighbors.    Let's assume an inquiry does take place, concludes the Kurds have been gassed, and Iraq is once again censured: What then?    Baghdad, with the Arab League and the Soviets behind it, thumbs its nose at the West's condemnatory declarations. Economic sanctions, which are never universal, do little to deter new violations. Withholding chemical weapons technology, little different from fertilizer manufacturing, seems irrelevant today. Serious intervention by an international force like the U.N. is politically unrealistic. In the post-Irangate atmosphere, an effort to arm the Kurds for self-defense would likely bog down in Jim Wright's Congress.    There is much talk about the virtue of arms treaties. But the use of chemical weapons of the kind Iraq is accused of deploying is already illegal under terms of a 1925 arms-control treaty to which Iraq is a signatory.    The fact is that the world doesn't know what to do when international law without an enforcement mechanism is violated. The West, for all its years of hand-wringing about terrorism, has lacked the cohesion and the will to discipline Soviet clients such as Iraq, Vietnam and Cuba, regardless of the gravity of their deeds. When the Reagan administration made a single bombing run against Ghadafi's Libya, much of the policy-making elite quaked or condemned it. If the world is in fact capable of doing little once bullies are in power, the solution would seem to lie in preventing the likes of the Baathists in Iraq, the Sandinistas in Nicaragua and the Cuban-backed MPLA in Angola from coming to power in the first place. </TEXT></DOC>
