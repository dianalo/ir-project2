Next month, hundreds of researchers will move into this &quot;high-tech research tower,&quot; built by the steelmaker for $33 million.    The sparkling lab and silent blast furnaces bespeak the company's struggle for survival. Kawasaki Steel expects to post a loss equivalent to $330 million for the fiscal year ending this month. The company has cut managers' salaries, closed mills, slashed capital investment and put workers on furlough -- but it hasn't touched research-and-development outlays.    &quot;We won't cut Randamp;D,&quot; says Nobuo Ohashi, managing director of Kawasaki Steel's research labs, &quot;unless there's absolutely nothing else left to cut.&quot;    The story is much the same with Japan's other smokestack industries. The high yen is shriveling profits of companies already faced with slack markets and such new lost-cost rivals as South Korea. But while Japan's steel companies, shipyards, textile mills and even high-technology concerns are cutting costs to survive the crisis, they keep pouring cash into research.    &quot;It's the most important expenditure for our future,&quot; says Toshiba Corp.'s president, Sugiichiro Watari.    The strategy illustrates one of the strengths of the Japanese economy. Western manufacturers, especially in older industries, often cut costs across the board when profits fall. In Japan, where stockholders are patient, loans come easy and takeovers are rare, Randamp;D in times of hardship is a must.    And while the stong yen makes dollar-denominated products competitive now, the Japanese expect their research push to help them emerge with competitive new technologies.    Few industries have been hit harder than steel. With the strong yen and a steel market glutted by cheaper Korean and Brazilian output, Japan's steelmakers face a plight similar to the one they forced on their American and European counterparts. Exports have fallen sharply. Such giants as Nippon Steel Corp., Kawasaki Steel, Nippon Kokan K.K. and Kobe Steel Ltd. are posting losses and cutting jobs.    In similar straits, many big U.S. steelmakers reduced research-and-development budgets. Bethlehem Steel Corp. of the U.S. cut research spending in 1982 when it began to incur losses, and followed with further cuts in 1983 and 1984. The company sold its research center, reduced the number of researchers to 450 from nearly 1,000 in the 1960s and moved many of the remaining employees out of central research laboratories and into the plants.    (Of course, many bigger Western companies maintain research and development in bad times, especially in such high-tech industries as semiconductors. America's Intel Corp. and Motorola Inc. didn't cut research spending during the industry's slump in 1985 and 1986. And many Western companies are following the Japanese lead in maintaining Randamp;D now.)    But unlike some of their U.S. competitors, Japanese steelmakers are maintaining research spending and bringing researchers under one roof. Nippon Kokan, Japan's No. 2 steel concern, increased Randamp;D outlays 15% in 1986 from the prior year, to almost $200 million. Kobe Steel is holding its outlays to last year's levels, as is Kawasaki Steel.    All three will open expensive central-research labs this year, squeezing costs in other areas to maintain the investment. &quot;We have to bite the bullet today to be able to eat tomorrow,&quot; says Kobe Steel spokesman Mitsuo Sakamoto. Kobe Steel researchers are studying biotechnology, water processing and alcohol production. &quot;Steel will never grow like it did,&quot; Mr. Sakamoto says. &quot;If we don't open new areas, we can't survive.&quot;    Until two years ago, Kawasaki Steel wasn't even doing research in fields other than steel. Now 60% of its nearly 433 researchers study dozens of non-steel technologies, including lasers, semiconductors, solar cells and superstrong composite materials. While the steelmaker plans to cut 5,300 blue-collar positions by the end of 1988, it is stepping up its hiring of young researchers. The company's research center hired 50 new graduates last year, up from 20 in 1984.    &quot;Without research muscle we have no future,&quot; says Mr. Ohashi, Kawasaki Steel's research director. &quot;We can't expect to start making profits in new businesses in just a few years. But if the high yen continues, we'll be needing it.&quot;    Steel isn't alone in this attitude. For example, a textile maker, Teijin Ltd., is cutting expenses. The textile industry was battered by less-expensive textiles from Southeast Asia even before the yen began to surge. Teijin began closing factory lines last July, including some of its most automated, and expects a 20% drop in profit in the year ending this month.    But while one-third of its mills stand idle, Teijin's research lab near Tokyo goes full bore on such products as pharmaceuticals and fibers. The company increased Randamp;D spending 6% in 1986, to $92.5 million. Cutting such outlays &quot;would be suicide,&quot; says a Teijin official.    Many analysts expect Japanese companies, even in smokestack industries, to emerge from the yen crisis better off. Trimming the fat off production and developing products will make them more competitive in the future, they say.    Japanese companies can afford to wait because they have an ally in their big shareholders. These are mainly banks, insurance companies and institutional investors that don't meddle in management and that don't press for short-term profitability or cost-cutting measures. That gives the companies the luxury of pumping money into research even if it hurts the balance sheet.    What's more, they can fund long-range Randamp;D efforts even in lean times through access to easy financing from Japanese banks, many of which are stockholders. Weak, company-based unions also make it possible to channel funds into Randamp;D, even while forcing workers to accept pay freezes and forced holidays on reduced pay.    High-tech companies are still more adamant about keeping research budgets intact. Toshiba says 30% of its products were developed in the past three years. In five years, it expects half of its products will have been developed in the previous three years.    &quot;If we don't do our Randamp;D now, our sales in five years will be halved,&quot; says Sakae Shimizu, senior executive vice president. &quot;It's like food -- it's the last thing you cut out.&quot;    Japan's electronics giants saw profits fall last year as demand for computer chips and other exports tumbled. But &quot;when things get rough, the trend here is to focus even more on research,&quot; says Hisao Oka, a Mitsubishi Electric Corp. managing director. &quot;Right now that's one of our weapons against the high yen.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
