Danny Wall, Republican staff director of the Senate Banking Committee, to be chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, according to a senior White House official.    In selecting a new chairman for the troubled agency, Mr. Reagan had to choose between Mr. Wall and Colorado real estate developer Philip Winn -- both GOP loyalists and both backed by important Republican senators.    If he is confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Wall would succeed Edwin Gray, who was appointed by Mr. Reagan but has often been at odds with the administration on regulatory policy. Mr. Gray's term expires June 30.    Mr. Wall, 47 years old, had the support of Utah Sen. Jake Garn, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. The two men have worked together since the early 1970s, when Mr. Garn was mayor of Salt Lake City and Mr. Wall was executive director of the city's redevelopment agency. When Mr. Garn was elected to the Senate in 1974, Mr. Wall became his legislative aide.    Colorado Sen. William Armstrong, also a member of the Senate Banking Committee, is Mr. Winn's primary backer, although at least seven other Republican senators also wrote Mr. Reagan to support him.    Mr. Winn, 62, has been an important fund-raiser for several Republican candidates, including President Reagan and Sen. Armstrong. A former Colorado GOP chairman and gubernatorial candidate, Mr. Winn served as assistant secretary for Housing and Urban Development in the beginning of the Reagan administration.    Thrift-industry supporters of Mr. Winn said the new Bank Board chairman should be someone with strong management experience. This was especially important, they said, to ease concerns in Congress. Lawmakers currently are considering plans to raise funds for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which the Bank Board oversees.    Critics have regarded Mr. Gray as a poor manager, and his tenure at the Bank Board has been marked by continued staff upheaval.    Mr. Wall's supporters stressed his knowledge of the legislative process and of the problems facing the thrift industry. They also pointed out that his working relationship with both Mr. Garn and Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) would mean easy confirmation.    With the nomination of Mr. Wall, the three-member Bank Board would still have one vacancy. Lee Henkel resigned from the Bank Board earlier this month after the federal Office of Government Ethics asked for a Justice Department probe of a rule he proposed. Bank Board officials said the rule could have benefited a thrift with which Mr. Henkel had business dealings.    Separately, President Reagan nominated Charles Rule, an outspoken advocate of industry deregulation, as head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. Mr. Rule, whose nomination was expected, should easily win approval in the Senate.    Mr. Rule, 31, is the department's acting antitrust chief and was Attorney General Edwin Meese's choice for the job. He helped develop and carry out the Reagan administration's hands-off policy toward mergers and acquisitions over the past few years.    He is expected to concentrate on prosecuting criminal bid-rigging and price-fixing cases. Mr. Rule, a Nashville, Tenn., native, is a graduate of Vanderbilt University and the University of Chicago Law School. </TEXT></DOC>
