I like crime.&quot;    The Soviet Union's first private eye bends over the burner of the kitchen stove and lights a cigarette. He is 30 years old, with a squarish build, cropped hair and steel-rimmed glasses. A jagged scar runs through his lower lip halfway to the tip of his jaw. He doesn't talk about how he got it.    Mr. Kosyakov keeps his address under wraps. He agreed to meet in a foreigners' compound and flashed his plasticized identification card to impress the uniformed policeman in the guard box outside.    The card has a blue diagonal line across it -- &quot;to prevent forgery&quot; -- and the word &quot;ALEX&quot; in capital letters. &quot;It means protector, if you translate from the Greek,&quot; Mr. Kosyakov says.    He registered officially in Leningrad in February. In April, he opened a Moscow branch. To hear him tell it, the Soviet police were glad to get some help in a line of work that had been communism's least penetrable monopoly. &quot;Everybody understands,&quot; he says, &quot;that we strengthen order in the country.&quot;    And order needs strengthening. This old police state isn't that tightly policed. Ethnic turmoil aside, the Soviet Union seems to be in the midst of a crime wave. Statistics released this year, after a half-century hiatus, show murders and attempted murders in 1988 rose 14% to 16,710 from a year earlier. (The U.S. counted 20,680 actual murders that year.) Assaults rose 32%, violent robberies 43%. In the first six months of this year, the numbers worsened. More than a million crimes were reported, up 32% from a year earlier. Street crime rose 84%, muggings 109%, crimes involving guns 22%.    It might be a mistake to blame this on Mikhail Gorbachev's new openness. Crime could have been worse in the &quot;stagnation&quot; that preceded him; figures for those years remain secret. But more crime is surely rising to the surface. Soviet policemen complain in public that their cars are too slow, their walkie-talkies too weak. They want more freedom to use their guns. In Leningrad, 30 patrolmen have died violently in the past five years. A memorial meeting for one of them in March turned into a demonstration for more pay and better equipment. Valentin Kosyakov had the same gripes. He quit the force.    &quot;I started as a cop on the street,&quot; he says, stubbing out his cigarette in a saucer on the kitchen table. &quot;I won't tell you when. Then I was an operative -- a detective -- in Moscow. There were detectives on various levels. I won't tell you the structure. When I left, I had a territory and a staff.&quot;    He specialized in economic crime: bribery and corruption, theft of state property, speculation. A speculator buys cheap and sells dear; here, that's illegal. A crooked boss pads his employee list and rakes off phony salaries; that's theft of state property.    &quot;You never heard of this?&quot; says the detective. &quot;Different systems, different crimes.&quot;    But the Soviet police system, he came to realize, &quot;couldn't solve all problems. We couldn't put a cop on every citizen.&quot; And Mr. Kosyakov had needs the police couldn't satisfy. &quot;I wanted to use computers. I couldn't.&quot; He also wanted more than $400 a month for risking his neck.    Now, he figures, he can have it all. &quot;We can do it privately. We can rent a cop.&quot;    His agency takes all comers. It protects cooperatives from protection rackets, hires out security guards and bodyguards. It sleuths for lawyers: &quot;We find witnesses and crack cases.&quot; And it fights spies (the commercial kind) for hard currency: &quot;We render assistance to resist espionage in joint ventures.&quot;    Since the agency got some publicity on Soviet television, the phone in Mr. Kosyakov's hidden office &quot;is permanently ringing.&quot; So far, most calls come from parents who want wayward children traced.    &quot;Surveillance is a possible method for dealing with this,&quot; the detective says, stubbing out another cigarette. &quot;Morally, it is not clean to follow children. There are other methods. We do not reveal our methods.&quot; He doesn't stoop to divorce work, either.    Twenty full-time operatives have signed on in his Moscow branch, Mr. Kosyakov discloses, plus 50 part-timers. &quot;I don't want to tell you how many we have in Leningrad.&quot; All have Interior Ministry or KGB experience; some left voluntarily, some didn't. &quot;A person can be fired,&quot; Mr. Kosyakov says of his new hires, &quot;not because he is a bad worker but because he has conflicts with his boss.&quot;    Mr. Kosyakov is getting along fine with his old bosses. He says he is talking with them about using the agency's new Soviet personal computers to tap into the Interior Ministry's crime files. On guard duty, the Kosyakov rent-a-cops have won permission to wear uniforms: black shirts, black trousers, and black baseball caps by night; the same outfit, in camouflage khaki, by day.    &quot;We'd love to buy those hats in America,&quot; Mr. Kosyakov says. He would also love to get clearance to buy and carry guns. &quot;It's a necessity. We are negotiating that. We can have air pistols now. You have them on sale in America.&quot;    If Mr. Kosyakov fulfills his ambitions, private eyes will soon be opening offices from Brest to Vladivostok. &quot;We already have a few branches,&quot; he says. He won't say where. &quot;We want to create an all-national system.&quot;    And what about the bottom line: How much does hiring a private detective cost in the Soviet Union? Mr. Kosyakov gets up to go. &quot;I don't have the authority to reveal concrete figures.&quot;    He leaves, forgets his umbrella, comes back to get it, and drops a hint: &quot;Cheaper than Pinkertons.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
