Don Oberdorfer, the veterandiplomatic correspondent of the Washington Post, is willingto contravene, however subtly, the taboo against creditinganother towering figure of the 1980s, Ronald Reagan. As aresult, his book, &quot;The Turn: From the Cold War to a New Era&quot;(Poseidon Press, 514 pages, $25), lives up to its billing asa fair-minded, not to mention gracefully written, history ofthe Cold War's denouement.   The less-than-scintillating story line is organized aroundthe six U.S.-Soviet summits that the author covered for thePost. Freed from the hype, spin control and exaggerated senseof urgency that normally accompany such affairs, Mr.Oberdorfer has stepped back to put the Reagan-Gorbachevgyrations in perspective.</LP><TEXT>   The author demolishes the canard, advanced at variouspoints by both liberals and conservatives, that there weretwo Reagans, the Cold Warrior followed by the peacenik. Thepoint is that Mr. Reagan's anti-communism and his wish to&quot;reach out&quot; to the Soviets were never contradictory. In 1983,the same year as the famous &quot;Evil Empire&quot; speech, Mr. Reagansaid, &quot;My dream is to see the day when nuclear weapons willbe banished from the face of the Earth.&quot; (Mr. Oberdorferwrites that this is the first such declaration, but morethorough students of Reaganism will know that he said thesame at the GOP convention in 1976.)   Unlike Presidents Nixon, Ford and Carter, Mr. Reagan firstengaged the Soviets (at Geneva in 1985) from a position ofstrength -- after the Pershing deployment, after Grenada,after the Reagan Doctrine, after the economic turnaround andthe military buildup. All of this merely set the stage forthe ensuing acts: democratization of the Third World,bilateral disarmament and, ultimately, the dissolution ofcommunism itself.   Contrary to the headlines of the time, the author showsthat at the tactical level Mr. Reagan consistently bested Mr.Gorbachev, who kicked and screamed at Geneva and Reykjavik toget the U.S. to give up the Strategic Defense Initiative. Mr.Oberdorfer suggests that Mr. Gorbachev's ballyhooed &quot;newthinking&quot; was largely the result of Mr. Reagan's boldness andtenacity in advocating the space shield against nuclearmissiles. Of course, this will go down as one of history'sgreat ironies. Had the fearful Soviet leader only known moreabout the ways of Washington, he would have sat tight andwaited for the State Department, the military bureaucracy andCongress to do the job for him.   By the time Mr. Reagan journeyed to Moscow in 1988, hisopposite number was saying such previously unthinkable thingsas &quot;the Soviet Union does not pretend to have the finaltruth&quot; and &quot;we do not impose our way of life on otherpeople.&quot; The Soviets soon acted on the latter statement,crying uncle in Afghanistan. Here, however, it is theauthor's knowledge of Washington that falls short. He creditsformer Secretary of State George Shultz, a major source forthis book, for the Soviet retreat, yet the State Departmentfought the decision to deliver effective arms to theanticommunist Afghan resistance.   Mr. Shultz may not always have been on the right side ofpolicy squabbles in Washington, but Mr. Oberdorfer shows himto be as unyielding as the Gipper in advocating the settledU.S. position with Moscow, especially in resisting enormouspressures to sign flawed arms control accords. In fact,Messrs. Reagan and Shultz left town without closing a deal onthe dicey matter of strategic nuclear weapons. At this point,Mr. Oberdorfer's narrative takes a revealing turn, as we areable to compare what had gone before with the ignorance andpliability of President Bush, and, even more so, of Secretaryof State James Baker, in their embrace of Mr. Gorbachev.   If Mr. Shultz was a tough old bird, Mr. Baker is apreening peacock (so much so that he saw fit to keep hispredecessor off the invitation list for the Bush inaugural).Mr. Baker is featured in a number of embarrassing sequences,determining &quot;that the Soviets would not upstage him again,&quot;&quot;arguing for compromises in the U.S. position,&quot; &quot;giving theSoviets cover,&quot; deciding &quot;it was politically imprudent tomeet {Lithuanian independence leader Vytautus} Landsbergis,&quot;&quot;swallowing hard and . . . meeting some of the Sovietmilitary's objections,&quot; and most tellingly of all, &quot;inventingreasons to go back to the press area of his plane.&quot;   Luckily, for just about everyone but himself, Mr.Gorbachev was simply too weak to be saved by Washington.Though Mr. Oberdorfer's account ends in mid-1990, it seemsfair to conclude that the administration's appeasement of themost unsavory forces in the Soviet Union, for example bysigning a trade agreement just after Moscow had imposed anoil embargo on Lithuania, helped pave the way to the Augustcoup. In this sense, it might be said that Mr. Bushunintentionally fulfilled the prophecy of Ronald Reagan.   ---   Mr. Brock is writing a book on Congress and foreignpolicy.</TEXT></DOC>
