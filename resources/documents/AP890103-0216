To the authorities holding him without bail, the 25-year-old LosAngeles man is an expert hacker who calls himself Condor and is sodangerous he must never be allowed to use even a telephone withoutsupervision.   ``He is truly a threat to society, someone who uses computers toact out personal vendettas against people,'' said Jim Black, acomputer crime specialist with the Police Department.   ``The bottom line with Kevin is that if you have a job, pay a gasbill, use a phone or drive a car he can find you and ruin youelectronically,'' Black said in a telephone interview. ``If hewasn't in jail, he could be listening to us right this minute.'   Mitnick was being held today in a maximum-security cell at thefederal Metropolitan Detention Center.   A federal grand jury indicted him Dec. 20 on computer fraudcharges, accusing him of using unauthorized MCI long-distance codesto tap into computers at Leeds University in England and theUniversity of Southern California and causing $4 million damage to aDigital Equipment Corp. computer system.   Mitnick will plead innocent, said his attorney, Alan Rubin.   ``We will also try to get bail set,'' Rubin said. ``I am shockedand astonished that my client is being held without bail and insolitary confinement. This thing has been blown completely out ofproportion.''   Longtime associate Leonard DiCicco, 23, of Calabasas, said hereported Mitnick's activities to authorities because Mitnick hadbeen threatening him.   ``He was using DEC computers where I work and threatening that wewould both go down if I said anything,'' said DiCicco, who faces nocharges in the inquiry.   ``He has no sense of right or wrong and no respect for anyoneelse's privacy,'' DiCicco said. ``I was beside him through all thishacking and it's scary to think of the things he is capable of.''   ``He could pick apart almost any computer system in the UnitedStates,'' Black said. ``There are probably only a handful ofcomputer specialists with his capabilities.''   In his electronic activities, the 5-11, 240-pound Mitnickreferred to himself as Condor, Black said. DiCicco said Mitnicknamed himself for Robert Redford's character's code name in the spymovie ``Three Days of the Condor.''   ``All he did was eat Fat Burgers, drink Slurpees and work oncomputers,'' DiCicco said. ``He was a big, fat slob of a guy whocouldn't get through a day without breaking into a computersomewhere.''   Mitnick began his hacking career using telephones, authoritiessaid. By age 13, he was under investigation by the policedepartment, Pacific Bell telephone company and the FederalCommunications Commission, the Los Angeles Daily News said Monday.   ``Mitnick was a legend to the computer world by 1981,'' said JohnChrist, his high school computer teacher.   In 1982, DiCicco said, he and Mitnick used USC's 24-hour studentcomputer lab to get into many computers, including classifiedsystems.   ``Our favorite was the National Security Agency computer becauseit was supposed to be so confidential,'' DiCicco said. ``It was likea big playground once you got into it.''</TEXT></DOC>
