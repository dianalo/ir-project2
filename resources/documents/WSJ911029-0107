For Japanese government and industry, the highlyradioactive material is the heart of a longtime quest forgreater energy independence.</LP><TEXT>   Plutonium, which can be used to create more plutonium, &quot;isregarded as a quasi-domestically produced material,&quot; says theJapanese government's annual white paper on atomic energy,approved by the cabinet last week. Promotion of its use &quot;issteadily developing&quot; and &quot;is significant in Japan, which isaiming to be a technologically advanced nation.&quot;   But for environmentalists, the cargo is anightmare-in-waiting, tempting terrorists and threateningdangerous leaks of radioactivity. At a conference in Omiyanorth of Tokyo this weekend, they will kick off a campaign torally world opinion against the plans.   &quot;There's no way to protect a sea shipment of plutonium,&quot;says Damon Moglen of the environmental group Greenpeace.&quot;This is of tremendous international significance.&quot;   Japan is the only country actively building a &quot;plutoniumeconomy.&quot; Since the silvery-gray metal was discovered a halfcentury ago, scientists have hoped plutonium could be alimitless source of energy when plugged into so-calledfast-breeder reactors. Uranium, which runs most of today'snuclear reactors, can be used only once.   But the fast-breeder technology has proved far moredifficult than expected, while the prices of uranium andother alternative fuels have remained far lower thanexpected. Fears also have grown about the other main use ofplutonium: nuclear weapons. Even if Japan, as it insists, hasno active nuclear armaments program, analysts say it is verydifficult to keep a foolproof safeguard over supplies. Ittakes only a few pounds to create a crude bomb.   The Carter administration substantially cut U.S. plans todevelop plutonium reactors in the 1970s. Britain, France andGermany have recently slowed their programs. But Japan isconcerned by its lack of raw materials, the majorvulnerability of its smoothly run economy.   Japan's push to plutonium comes despite problems plaguingits conventional uranium reactor program. The governmenthopes to build about 40 more uranium reactors over the nexttwo decades, boosting its use of nuclear electricity to morethan 40% from the current 26%.   But even with a pro-nuclear consensus among the country'selite, the public has its doubts. Worries spread earlier thisyear after a series of emergency reactor shutdowns. Thegovernment has secured necessary site approval for only aboutone-fourth of its planned plants.   The elaborate blueprint for Japan's future plutoniuminfrastructure was drafted during the 1970s. At that time,the government assumed breeder reactors would be commerciallyviable not long after the next century began. The utilitiesalso began planning a reprocessing facility to extractplutonium from used-up uranium. Until completion of thisreprocessing plant in the late 1990s, Japan decided to shipits uranium waste to France and the United Kingdom forreprocessing.   Now, many parts of the plutonium plan are coming tofruition. The reprocessed nuclear fuel will start coming backnext year and as much as 30 metric tons will follow ininstallments over the next 20 years.   But critics say that some of the basic assumptions thatset that whole plutonium plan in motion have changed, or wereflawed in the first place. Activists want to focusinternational attention over the next year on theimplications of transferring the plutonium by sea. (Japanwanted to send it by plane, but the U.S., which has a saybecause the original uranium was enriched in the U.S.,objected and the Senate approved a 30-year U.S.-Japan nucleartreaty that allows for sea shipments.)   Japan, which has a constitutional ban on overseas militaryactivities, will escort the shipments with its civilianMaritime Safety Agency. &quot;We have been doing very well insafeguards,&quot; says Kimikazu Iwase, deputy director of theScience and Technology Agency's Nuclear Fuel Division. &quot;Weare confident.&quot;   But besides the risk, opponents say, Japan may not even beable to use the plutonium that is shipped. Breeder reactorswon't be commercially practical for another 30 to 40 years,Japanese government officials say. So while Japan will importand generate up to 85 tons of plutonium through the year2010, demand from fast-breeder reactors will be a maximum of33 tons, according to government estimates.   Japanese officials insist they won't build a plutoniumstockpile, but will use the fuel in other reactors.   Jizaburo Takagi, one of Japan's leading anti-nuclearactivists, estimates a surplus of about 70 tons of plutoniumby 2010, and wrote in a recent paper that &quot;Japan will have anenormous stockpile of plutonium that will surpass in the2020s all the military plutonium ever produced by nuclearsuperpowers for weapon use.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
