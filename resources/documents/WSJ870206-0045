One of the banks -- Boulevard State Bank, Wichita, Kan. -- is to reopen today as a unit of Union Bancshares Inc., also of Wichita. The insured deposits of a second bank, Market National Bank, Denver, were transferred to another bank. FDIC officials were working last night to resolve the status of the third institution, Sunbelt National Bank, Dallas.    Boulevard State, closed by state banking authorities, was the largest bank to fail in Kansas, according to FDIC officials. Its four offices are to reopen as Union Boulevard National Bank, a newly chartered unit of Union Bancshares. Boulevard had assets of $99 million and held deposits of $84.9 million in 19,800 accounts.    The insured deposits of Market National are to be available at Women's Bank, also in Denver, beginning today. The FDIC arranged the transfer because the agency received no bids for the purchase of the failed bank.    Market National had assets of $9 million and held deposits of $8.9 million in 800 accounts, including $110,000 in 54 accounts that exceeds the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor. Holders of those accounts will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds from the liquidation of the bank's assets.    FDIC officials were trying to arrange the purchase of Sunbelt National, which had assets of $11.2 million and held deposits of $11.1 million in 3,500 accounts. </TEXT></DOC>
