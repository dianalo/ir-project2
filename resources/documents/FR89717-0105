The awards are established to achieve the following objectives: andbullet; To attract and retain the Nation's most outstanding and promisingyoung scientists and engineers to an academic career of research and teachingso they may help to meet the need for highly qualified scientists and engineers.andbullet; To help develop improved links and cooperation between industryand universities. A maximum of 200 new Presidential Young Investigator Awards will be madein this competition. Awards will be made for up to five years based onthe annual determination of satisfactory performance and subject to theavailability of funds. <ITAG tagnum="84">Eligibility </ITAG>Any U.S. institution that awards a baccalaureate, master's or doctoraldegree in a field supported by the Foundation is eligible to participatein this program. Only the department chairperson or analogous administrativeofficial at the institution may nominate its faculty members for the awards.Nominees must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents as of October 2,1989. To be eligible, nominees must have a tenure-track or tenured facultyposition at their nominating institution or receive an appointment to sucha position to begin on or before October 1, 1990. Nominees must have beguntheir first tenure-track position at any college or university after April30, 1986 and must have a Ph.D. degree, or equivalent, awarded or to beawarded after January 1, 1984. Since PYI awards must be used to fund research activities, which normallywill involve undergraduate and graduate students from the nominating institution,PYI nominees must have a clearly demonstrated ability to conduct a researchprogram. Awardees may conduct research in any branch of science or engineeringnormally supported by the NSF. Particular emphasis in the selection ofawardees will be given to those fields where there are substantial needsfor faculty development. NSF normally will not support clinical research such as biomedical researchwith disease-related goals, including work on the etiology, diagnosis,or treatment of physical or mental disease, abnormality, or malfunctionin human beings or animals. Animal models of such conditions, or the developmentor testing of drugs or other procedures for their treatment also generallyare not eligible for support. NSF does not normally support pilot plantefforts, research requiring security classification, the development ofproducts for commercial marketing, or market research for a particularproduct or invention. The PYI awards are intended to encourage the development of our futureacademic leaders, both in teaching and research. Presidential Young Investigatorsare expected to carry a normal teaching load relative to non-PYI facultyat the nominating institution. The PYI awards are tenable only in tenure-track or tenured positions ateligible institutions. Presidential Young Investigators who transfer toan ineligible institution at any time prior to or during the period oftheir grants must resign their awards. <ITAG tagnum="84">Support and Commitments </ITAG>The minimum Presidentia1 Young Investigator Award will consist of an annualbase grant of $25,000 from NSF, to be used to support the research activitiesof the awardee. Furthermore, in accordance with the program goals of leveragingFederal funds and fostering industry-university cooperation, the Foundationwill provide up to $37,500 of additional funds per year on a dollar-for-dollarmatching basis to contributions from industrial sources, resulting in totalannual support of up to $100,000. Institutions are also expected to make a significant commitment to thesupport of their awardees, including arranging for the industrial supportand guaranteeing full academic-year salary for the awardee. None of thePresidential Young Investigator funds, whether provided by the Foundationor by industry, may be used to underwrite academic-year salaries of theawardees. However, up to ten percent of the Foundation funds may be usedto defray administrative expenses in lieu of indirect costs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Application Procedures </ITAG>Nominations from an institution must originate from department chairpersonor analogous administrative official. Each nomination submission must include:andbullet; The Nomination Form provided in the PYI Program Guidelines. (Thefive-page form contains the Cover Sheet, Nominator's Narrative Statement,Nominee's Research and Teaching Qualifications, Nominee's Research Plan,and Support and Commitments.) andbullet; A complete curriculum vitae, which provides additional informationnot covered in the Nomination Form, including a list of research grantsawarded and bibliography of publications. andbullet; The Supplementary Nominee Information Form. andbullet; Recommendations from three referees who are familiar with theresearch and teaching interests and capability of the nominee.

The evaluation criteriainclude:andbullet; Nominee's competence in science or engineering_as evidenced bythe nominee's most outstanding achievements to date, particularly as attestedto by the quality of research and publications, teaching accomplishments,educational background, and the letters of recommendation.andbullet; Nominee's potential for continued professional growth as a researchscientist or engineer_as evidenced by the quality of the nominee's researchplan, the currency and significance of the research in the expressed field,the appropriateness of the research to his/her academic setting and itsprobable impact upon the institution's research environment.andbullet; Nominee's potential for significant development as a teacher andacademic leader in the training of future scientists and/or engineers_asevidenced by the nominee's commitment to an academic career, the narrativestatements describing the nominee's qualifications for this award withregard to their bearing on the nominee's development as an academic leaderand the nominee's potential impact on the institution in its teaching mission.Other factors, such as national needs, infrastructure needs of the field,representation of women and minorities, geographical and institutionalbalance, will also be considered after the technical merits of the nominationshave been ascertained.The selection of individuals to receive Presidential Young InvestigatorAwards will be made by the National Science Foundation with the adviceof panels of outstanding scientists and engineers.After an awardee has been selected, the employing institution will be askedto prepare a first-year budget request in support of the awardee's researchactivities. The budget should show both the amount requested from the Foundationand the sources and amounts of industrial support. This information willbe used in determining the amount of the award and other terms and conditions.Except as otherwise provided in this announcement, the terms and conditions,as well as the expected institution commitment, will be analogous to thosestated in the publication, NSF 83-57 (March 1989)_Grants for Research andEducation in Science and Engineering. Similar submissions will be requiredannually for each successive year of support under this program.The FY 1990 PYI awardees will be announced in late March 1990 and haveuntil June 1, 1990 to accept the offers from NSF. They will be expectedto begin their research activities under this program by October 2, 1990,or sooner if they wish.<ITAG tagnum="84">Inquiries</ITAG>Inquiries regarding the awards may be addressed to the Presidential YoungInvestigator Awards, National Science Foundation, Washington, DC 20550,or telephoned inquiries to (202) 357-9466.<ITAG tagnum="6">Chor Weng Tan,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Progam Director, PYI.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="34">July 11, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-16604 Filed 7-14-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 7555-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
