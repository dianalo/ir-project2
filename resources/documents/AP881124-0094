WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscherwill try to negotiate the release of foreign hostages held inLebanon during a visit to Iran that begins this weekend, diplomaticsources said Thursday.   ``The minister has offered his services to secure the release ofall hostages and the Iranian government has assured us that thiscorresponds with their aims,'' an official source said privately.   Nearly all the hostages are believed held by Lebanese ShiiteMoslem extremists loyal to Iran.   Iranian media also the 14 hostages, who include nine Americans,were among Genscher's principal motives for the two-day trip, whichbegins Sunday. The English-language Tehran Times said he might makea special effort in the case of Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite.   Iran has said consistently it has no control over the activitiesof Shiite groups in Lebanon, but the government source a second WestGerman official said Genscher would make another plea forinterecession.   The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,1985. Waite disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his hotel inMoslem west Beirut to negotiate for the release of Anderson andother Americans.   Some foreign businessmen and diplomats in Bonn feel Iran may bewilling to trade its influence with the captors for favorableEuropean trade agreements to repair an economy ravaged by eightyears of war with Iraq.   West Germany is among Iran's main trading partners. The EconomicsMinistry says Iran continues to import more goods from West Germanythan from any other country despite a decline due to the war, inwhich a cease-fire began Aug. 20.   Foreign Ministry announcements have said only that Genscher willmeet with senior Iranian government officials and industry leaders.   No Germans are among the hostages now held in Lebanon.   West German officials, including Genscher, said they won therelease of hostages Alfred Schmidt and Rudolf Cordes through longnegotiations and the help of Iranian and Syrian officials. They havedenied media reports of ransom.   In September, the Hamburg newspaper Bild said as much as $22.2million was paid for the release of Cordes.   He and Schmidt were kidnapped in January 1987 after a LebaneseShiite, Mohammed Ali Hamadi, was arrested and charged with murderand air piracy in the June 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner. Hamadiis being tried in Frankfurt.   Schmidt was released Sept. 7, 1987, and Cordes was freed twomonths ago.   Asked whether Genscher expected a breakthrough in Waite's case,one Bonn diplomat said the matter would be raised with Iranianofficials but he could not disclose details.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored inCyprus, carried a report Thursday from the Tehran Times that said:``A good guess, perhaps, is the possibility that Genscher'sdiscussions may turn a searchlight on the solution to the hostageissue in Lebanon, and the crisis this has generated.   ``Is it possible then that the German minister is here as amediator? Everything points to this being the case, and this accordswith recent moves to have Terry Waite, the Archbishop ofCanterbury's representative taken hostage in Lebanon, released.''   ``A number of requests have been made in recent months for therelease of hostages in Lebanon and for Iran to use its ideologicalinfluence there on humanitarian considerations to that end,'' thenewspaper was quoted as saying.   Some observers believe greater trade volume might generate moreserious Iranian efforts to free the hostages.   West Germany sold Iran $1.5 billion worth of goods in 1987,including motor vehicles, heavy machinery and electronic products,and its Iranian imports totaled $500 million.   About 30 prominent businessmen will accompany Genscher, who lastvisited Iran in July 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
