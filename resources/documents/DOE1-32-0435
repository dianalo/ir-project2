The position of the most favourable zone, which forms ashallow trough around the optimum, depends on the circumstances of anyparticular case, and should be identified with the EDP planning programsthat are now available. An example is used to show how the ZUPL layoutplanning program that has been written by Steinkohlenbergbauverein allowsa simple variation of the planning data for a given face, so as to findthe cost relations that are sought. A special form of presentation isdiscussed for the better identification of the relation between lengthand rate of advance of the face and output and costs. The authors concludeby discussing how the face costs are modified when the cost of drivingthe gates can be spread over several panels. 30 refs., 3 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
