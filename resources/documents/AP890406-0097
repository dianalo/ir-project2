At least six people died and 10 were wounded,authorities said.   Col. Ciro Lopez Roque, commander of the 4th brigade in ElParaiso, 40 miles north of San Salvador, said three soldiers andthree guerrillas were killed in the pre-dawn attack. Lopez saidfive soldiers were wounded.   He said the rebels did not penetrate the brigade's perimeter butthat several of their mortars landed inside.   The rebel's clandestine Radio Venceremos said the attack lastedtwo hours and was ``a success.'' It did not mention casualties.   Guerrilla troops also attacked the headquarters of the militaryengineers in Zacatecoluca, 35 miles southeast of San Salvador.   Col. Benjamin Canjura, post commander, said five civilians werewounded when homemade guerrilla artillery fell short of themilitary installation. He said there were no military casualties.   Both he and Lopez spoke in telephone interviews with TheAssociated Press.   An air force helicopter and an O-2 ``push-and-pull''reconnaissance aircraft fitted with machine guns and rockets forair support attacked retreating guerrilla forces on the slopes ofChinchontepec Volcano north of the city, witnesses said.   In another development, a man who identified himself as an urbanguerrilla of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front calledthe local Sonora radio station Wednesday to claim responsibilityfor the assassination on Tuesday of a police officer in the capital.   The caller, who claimed to speak for the Juan Castro UrbanCommandos, said the group ``would remain vigilant'' to the actionsof the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, judges and membersof the Supreme Court in connection with a case implicating militarymen and businessmen in an early 1980s kidnap-for-profit ring.   The caller said guerrillas ``would take the appropriate action''if they found anyone acting in support of those implicated in therightist ring.   One of the suspects was freed Friday on orders of an outgoingjudge. The order was overturned Monday by the judge's successor.   The suspects in the case are friends and associates of RobertoD'Aubuisson, founder of the Alliance, which is known by its Spanishacronym, Arena.   The rebels have waged a nine-year war against the U.S.-supportedgovernment. More than 70,000 Salvadorans, most of them civilians,have been killed.   They have stepped up attacks recently to protest the recentelection of right-wing businessman Alfredo Cristiani to thepresidency.   They threatened to present Cristiani with ``an ungovernablecountry'' when he takes office June 1. Cristiani was the candidateof Arena in the March 19 election.</TEXT></DOC>
