Treatment with the H 2-receptor antagonist, ranitidine, did notresult in decreased absorption of /sup 57/Co-labelled liver bound cobalaminsin healthy individuals. R-protein and the R-proteincobalamin complexwere determined by the FPLC Mono S chromatography method with a highdegree of correlation to the charcoal method in saliva, gastric and duodenaljuice, and with a high degree of reproducibility. Omeprazole markedlyinhibited the gastric acid and pepsin secretion, but did nor inhibitthe IF secretion. Omeprazole treatment resulted in anacidity in 14 of17 individuals, but did not reduce the absorption of liver bound /sup57/Co-labelled cobalamins. The intrinsic factor concentration in gastricaspirates measured during the study was unchanged during omeprazole treatment.The release of cobalamins from liver homogenate was markedly inhibitedby neutralized gastric juice in vitro, probably due to decreased pepsinmediated proteolysis. In vivo the cobalamin release from liver homogenatewas modestly inhibited in the stomach but was unaffected in jejunum duringomeprazole treatment. The major part of /sup 57/Co-labelled liver cobalaminsbound to R-protein in acid and neutral gastric juice in vitro, and omeprazoleinduced anacidity, did not influence the cobalamin binding either ingastric or jejunal juice in vivo.
