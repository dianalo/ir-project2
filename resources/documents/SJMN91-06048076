For more than 30 years, passengersflying coach on commercial aircraft have been subjected to cramped seats andlittle legroom. They've been wedged in center seats, eaten bad food and beenforced to listen to screaming babies.;    And, for most of that period, therewere only two kinds of tickets: first-class (&quot;F&quot;) and coach (&quot;Y&quot;).  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Travel  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  AIRLINES GIVING COACH CLASS AN OVERHAUL  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  ConsumerInvestigative journalist Peter S. Greenberg writes a syndicated consumercolumn.  </MEMO><TEXT>     But since deregulation began in 1978, the price of coach tickets has variedwildly. In fact, at this writing, some airlines offer more than 60 pricecategories -- for the same coach seat, without the amenities of first orbusiness class.;    Coach prices can vary depending on such factors as how farin advance travelers purchase their tickets, what day of the week they fly,how long they stay at their destination, the time of the year and whether theyqualify for corporate, military, senior or student discounts.;    Notsurprisingly, such a variation has made for some very angry coach passengers.;   &quot;Nothing makes a coach-class passenger complain more than when he finds outthe person sitting next to him, in the same type of seat, eating the samemeal, paid less than half of what he did,&quot; says George Brennan, a formersenior vice president of marketing for Eastern Airlines.;    Indeed, manyairlines are looking at ways to redefine coach -- the class, the cabin and theservice.;    For years, TWA has been automatically upgrading full-fare coachpassengers to Ambassador (business) class on domestic flights. And in somecases, members of Pan Am's frequent flier program holding coach tickets canoften get bumped up to Clipper (business) class.;    Northwest Airlinesrecently announced a transcontinental promotion that automatically upgradesfull-fare coach passengers to the front cabin. On all flights from Los Angelesand San Francisco to New York, Washington, Boston and Philadelphia, passengersholding full coach tickets will be flown in first class. As a comparison,first-class fare between Los Angeles and New York is $2,202. Full-fare coachis $1,262.;    Last August, MGM Grand Air, known for all-first-class deluxeservice, added coach class to its fleet of three DC-8 jets.;    On the MGMjets, behind the first-class cabin are 40 first-class leather seats arrangedin two-by-two seating. It's definitely an upscale coach product. There's a5-inch television monitor for each two seats, an air-to-ground phone andspecial PC outlets to power portable computers.;    Meal service, space andcomfort in the first-class cabin is extensive, and passengers pay fullfirst-class fares. But anyone flying on a full-fare coach ticket flies in thenewly created Grand Class Coach, which is the equivalent of most domestic U.S.airlines' first-class sections.;    Foreign airlines also are beginning totake a hard look at their coach class.;    After spending $40 million toredesign its business-class cabin and service, British Airways recentlydecided to concentrate on the back of the plane. The airline just invested anadditional $30 million to essentially relaunch coach class, with a newemphasis on service and individual attention.;    On intercontinental flights,British Airways' coach class is now called World Traveller (and within Europe,Euro Traveller).;    &quot;We did a lot of research among passengers,&quot; says IanMcComas, British Airways' manager for World Traveller, &quot;and the feeling morethan anything was that coach passengers weren't valued by airlines, that wedidn't care anything about them -- that was the general feeling. Ourpassengers knew they wouldn't get as much room or food, but they wanted thesame service, and they didn't understand why they didn't get it.;    &quot;It wasreally quite simple. They wanted to feel wanted and welcome.&quot;;    BritishAirways held special retraining forums for cabin crew on the new approach forcoach passengers.;    &quot;We reminded the crews how exciting it was for mostpassengers to fly -- how it could be a novel experience,&quot; McComas says. &quot;Afterall, many coach passengers are first- or second-time fliers.&quot;;    However,don't expect a redesigned coach section on British Airways planes. The coachseats are still coach seats. The legroom is still tight. And there's still10-across seating on its 747s.;    Where British Airways spent the money wason some small, but distinct, product and psychological benefits. The airlinechanged both the pillows and seat headrest covers on its entire fleet fromdeep red to white -- the color change gives the impression of more space andcomfort. Coach passengers now get a round of orange juice before takeoff, aswell as hot towels after the meal service.;    &quot;On a psychological level,&quot;McComas says, &quot;it makes the cabin crew visible and forces interaction. If yougo into a store and spend $500 or $1,000, you expect someone to pay attentionto you. We feel it should be no different on a flight.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Peter S.
