According to the geological conditions,site specific scenarios are considered to assess the long-term performanceof potential repositories. The modelling work for performance assessmentsdepends on the site and the scenario especially for the near field. Hence,site specific near field models have been developed. Up to now, severalperformance assessments have been carried out, results of which are beingused to influence and stimulate future research and developed work.</TEXT></DOC>
