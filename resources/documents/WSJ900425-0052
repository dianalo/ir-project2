With more than265 billion of them distributed last year alone, it's nowonder redemption rates among a coupon-weary population aresteadily sliding.   That's why manufacturers are scrambling to find newmarkets that aren't saturated with coupons, and they thinkthey've hit on a big one -- the U.S. Hispanic population.</LP><TEXT>   For years, most packaged-goods companies largely avoidedHispanics, even though they account for as much as 10% of thegeneral population by some estimates. Hispanics didn't seemto redeem as many as other population groups. Often, theyequated the coupons with food stamps as symbols of poverty.   But recently, mass marketers have been learning how totailor coupons so that they're accepted in Spanish-speakingbarrios, where resistance has been greatest.   Procter andamp; Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive are generallyconsidered pioneers, and are fast being joined by others,including Philip Morris's Kraft General Foods and GeneralMills.   &quot;The general market is saturated with coupons, and usageis declining,&quot; says Sigfredo A. Hernandez, an assistantprofessor of marketing at Ryder College, and co-author of astudy of Hispanic coupon usage. &quot;That's why marketers shouldpay attention to the Hispanic market. It's unsaturated -- andit's up to marketers to take advantage of it.&quot;   Certainly, the potential is there. In 1988, the averageU.S household received a staggering 2,500 coupons apiece. Yetthe average U.S. Hispanic household received just 20 coupons,according to Kenneth Mitnick, president of Coupons Plus Inc.,which distributes coupons to Spanish-speaking homes. Perhapsthe reason why Hispanic redemption rates are lower thangeneral rates, Mr. Mitnick suggests, is that &quot;you cannot usewhat you don't receive.&quot;   Mass marketers, meanwhile, are faced with growingdisenchantment as they continue to throw billions of couponsat the general market. Even as the total number of couponsdistributed nationwide has climbed steadily to 267.6 billionlast year, redemption has steadily dropped from more than 3%to 2.7% in the past five years, according to Nielsen ClearingHouse.   While mass marketers readily agree that Hispanics are arelatively untapped market, few have successfully tackled themarket, because so few have understood it. According to Mr.Hernandez, 49% of Hispanics are partially assimilated intoU.S. culture, while 38% aren't assimilated at all. He saysneither group tends to read English-language Sundaynewspapers, where the vast majority of coupons are found.   Some Hispanics aren't familiar with how to use coupons,which aren't generally used in Latin America. That problem iscompounded by the fact that few marketers have printedcoupons in Spanish, the first language of many Hispanics. Inthe Philadelphia barrio that Mr. Hernandez studied, manycorner bodegas didn't even accept coupons.   Some savvier mass marketers are getting around thoseproblems by avoiding the print media, which is used todistribute coupons to the general population. Instead, theyuse direct mail, coupons in stores or even coupons delivereddoor to door.   Hispanic ad agency Font andamp; Vaamonde, for one, says it hasgotten redemption rates of 30% by delivering coupons door todoor, usually in combination with a promotion or sweepstakes.It also hands out coupons in stores, often at the same timeas sampling or demonstration programs are going on in thestore. Among the agency's clients is Procter andamp; Gamble, forwhich it handles Downy, Crisco and other brands.   Mr. Mitnick's Coupons Plus, meanwhile, distributesbilingual books of coupons by mail and in stores, and backsup the booklets with advertising on Spanish-languagetelevision. Among its clients is General Mills, whichadvertises its cereals, Hamburger Helper and other brands. Hesays that Hispanics have been &quot;tremendously responsive&quot; tothe promotions. The only reason they weren't more so in thepast, he contends, is because marketers didn't take the timeto try to reach them in Spanish and to explain how couponswork.   &quot;The Hispanic consumer of 1990 is like the general marketconsumer of the 1950s, when there wasn't the degree ofclutter there is today&quot; he says. &quot;They aren't jaded. Theyappreciate advertisers who speak to them in their ownlanguage. It shows a high level of respect for them, and theyrespond by buying products directly advertised to them.&quot;   ---   Ayer Set to `Stretch' Itself                                                                                                          At its annual shareholders meeting today, Ayer willannounce plans to launch an aggressive &quot;brand strategy&quot; forthe agency called &quot;Stretch.&quot;   Jerry J.
