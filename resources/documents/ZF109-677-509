(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Backup Software Eases File SearchesandM;As LANS proliferate and their storage capacities grow, network administratorsmust find ways to safely back up data and remove inactive files--tasksperformed by an increasing number of tape-backup software packages.andM;LAN administrators know all too well that megabytes--even gigabytes--of dataaccumulate very quickly in networking environments.andM;By identifying and removing clutter or unused files, valuable, primarystorage space can be regained.andM;Tape-backup hardware systems, such as quarter-inch, 8mm helical scan, digitalaudiotape (DAT) and data-cassette tape drives, provide users with aneconomical way to perform periodic backup operations.andP;  Once data is backed upto tape, the ability to find the archived file becomes crucial.andM;Developers of the tape-backup software used with these secondary storagedevices continue to work on perfecting the art of retrieval--finding fileswhose names often can't be remembered or whose tape location is forgotten.andM;Many tape-backup packages support file retrieval through an index located ona LAN file server or a workstation's hard disk.andP;  Each time a backup sessionis complete, the index is uptated with the name, time stamp and creation dateof the new files.andM;Also called a catalog or library, the index is managed differently dependingon the tape-backup software package.andM;Some systems, such as Palindrome Corp.'s Network Archivist, Emerald SystemsCorp.'s Emlib and Cheyenne Software Inc.'s ARCserve, maintain an index in arelational database so that the information can be sorted and manipulated atthe user's discretion.andM;Network Archivist, EmLib and ARCserve are tape-backup software packagesdesigned for use in NetWare LAN environments.andM;By recording index information in a relational database, ARCserve is able toupdate a file's original index entry each time that file is backed up, saidJim McNiel, director of business development at Cheyenne Software in Roslyn,N.Y.andM;&quot;The first time a file is stored we record in the database its path name andwhere it is going to be stored on tape.andM;&quot;Any successive backup or archive of that file will result in a pointer thatpoints back to the original name to keep the database from getting toolarge,&quot; he said.andM;Emerald Systems and Palindrome provide similar functions with their libraryfeatures, according to officials from these firms.andM;&quot;An index should be self-maintaining,&quot; said Ron Birchall, president ofPalindrome in Naperville, Ill.andP;  When a tape is reused, for example, &quot;fileentries no longer on the tape should automatically be removed from the indexon the disk,&quot; he said.andM;Because an index is most important during a crisis--for example, when an oldspreadsheet needs to be resurrected for a meeting in 10 minutes--its ease ofuse and accuracy is vital, said Joseph O'Loughlin, senior product planningmanager at Emerald Systems Corp. in San Diego.andM;Emerald's EmLib file-management and indexing software is used in conjunctionwith either its EmSave (workstation-based) or its EmQ (server-based)tape-backup software packages.andP;  EmLib provides wild-card searching of theindex and records serial numbers on the tapes that correspond to the indexentry.andP;  Password protection allows the systems' administrator or individualuser to prevent unauthorized access to files on tape.andM;A relational database also allows users to develop complex automatic backup,archiving and deleting procedures.andM;Last month, Cheyenne began shipping ARCserve version 3.0 with a new QuickStart function that automatically develops complex network-backup procedures.andM;&quot;Quick Start queries the network to find every node address, and comes backwith a list of all potential backup tasks including the engineering server,the finance server and all workstations on the network,&quot; said McNiel.andM;The network administrator can then modify the Quick Start procedures or usethem in their entirety, said McNeil.andM;Network Archivist takes a different approach by using an expert system todevelop sets of rules for backup operations.andP;  A default set of rules providesfor three separate, permanent copies of a single archived file, as long as ithas not changed.andP;  Weekly and daily backup operations can also be tailored toa user's needs, said Palindrome's Birchall.andM;Network Archivist and ARCserve are among the only tape-backup packages tocurrently support the automatic backup and removal of inactive files from ahard disk.andP;  Both packages provide for the automatic archival of files thathave not been accessed in a specified amount of time and deletion of thatfile from the hard disk.andM;Some tape-backup programs make this archiving process a two-step operation.andM;EzTape from Irwin Magnetics Inc. allows users to identify a group of oldfiles, back them up and remove them from the hard disk, said Nancy Harbin,manager of product planning at the Ann Arbor, Mich., company.andM;With or without a relational database, the structure of an index is crucialto the software's ease of use and the ability to locate files.andP;  MaynStream3.0 from Maynard Electronics Inc. of Lake Mary, Fla., provides several levelsof cataloging, allowing users to list files by directory and other criteria,said Bernie Wu, Maynard's director of marketing.andM;Maynard plans to improve on its backup and indexing capabilities with aNovell NetWare backup package slated for release in the first quarter of1991.andP;  LANStream will be capable of backing up individual network nodes aswell as multiple servers, said Wu.andM;LANStream will feature a file catalog that lists all files backed up from aspecific drive.andP;  The catalog will &quot;emulate as closely as possible what theoriginal disk looked like to make the backup transparent to the end user,&quot;said Wu.andM;Some packages allow users to back up their own hard disks onto a shared tapedrive and also retrieve archived files.andP;  With ARCserve, for example, the usercan search the NetWare server-based index for matches to a wild card orfile-name query.andP;  Once files are selected, ARCserve indicates which tape toinsert to retrieve the files.andM;A new version of TapeWare tape-backup software for NetWare from EmeritusTechnologies in Fresno, Calif., scheduled to be released next month will alsoallow users to access a tape drive on a server to perform backup operationsand restore files, said Rod Christensen, the company's vice president ofengineering.andP;  The tape index created by TapeWare will look exactly like theindex on a hard disk, he said.andM;Another important aspect of managing archived files is the availability of abackup log or record of the backup session.andM;ARCserve maintains a transaction database and activity log for the systemadministrator's LAN backup tasks as well as the backup operations set up byindividual network users, said McNiel.andP;  The log indicates all of the jobsthat were completed successfully as well as any failures that occurred.andM;Sytron Corp.'s Sytos Plus for DOS and OS/2 also records a backup operation'sactivities and produces a log of what has been completed and what problemswere found, said Daud Power, director of product planning for the Westboro,Mass., firm.andM;Easy file retrieved from an index also requires a direct correlation betweenthe library function and restore capabilities, said Irwin's Harbin.andM;Users considering tape-backup software with indexing features shouldascertain how much hard-disk space is used by the index, said MaynardElectronics' Wu.andP;  Each index record in the MaynStream and LANStream catalogsrequires 40 bytes of storage space, he said.andM;Hard-disk storage requirements depend on the amount of information stored foreach file in the index.andP;  If networking files are supported, then networkingattributes are included, adding to the size of the index, said Sytron'sPower.andP;  If a file is deeply nested, then its lengthy path name will alsoenlarge the database.andM;The security of having an index that details the location of all backed upfiles must be considered when purchasing and using tape-backup software, saidPower.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
