In an attempt to head off an increasingly severe urban smogproblem this summer, the Environmental Protection Agency announcedFriday that gasoline volatility levels in most parts of the countryhas been set at 10.5 pounds per inch. Gasoline volatility generallyhas been at at a level of 11.5 psi.   The volatility levels of auto fuel which are controlled duringthe blending process, determine how easily gasoline evaporates andhow much hydrocarbon pollutants get into the air.   Hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides are key ingredients of ozone andurban smog.   The country had the worst urban smog problem in recent years lastsummer when federal maximum ozone levels were exceeded 60 percentmore often than in 1983, the worst previous year.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Younis' Sky Piracy Trial Goes to Jury</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jury deliberations in the sky piracy trial ofFawaz Younis are set to resume Monday to determine his fate oncharges in connection with the hijacking of Royal Jordanian Airlinesflight in June 1985.   The judge's instructions to the jury which met for four hoursFriday may have undercut the defendant's argument that Younis, whowitnesses identified as the leader in a group of four heavily armedmen that stormed the plane, acted as he did because he was a victimof the civil war that has engulfed Lebanon since 1975. .   ``Orders to hijack a plane ... are illegal orders,'' U.S.District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. told jurors. ``Obedience toillegal orders is no defense,'' said Robinson, emphasizing that onlyif Younis did not know that hijacking was illegal should he beacquitted.   Neither the two Americans aboard the aircraft nor any of theother 70 passengers and crew members were injured in the incidentwhich is viewed as a test of a 1984 ``long-arm'' statute thatasserts U.S. jurisdiction over cases involving American hostagestaken abroad.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Ambassador to Japan Named</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush has nominated undersecretary ofstate Michael Armacost to be ambassador to Japan, succeeding MikeMansfield.
