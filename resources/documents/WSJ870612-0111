Desktop computers, telecommunications networks and other new technologies have helped the industry increase productivity and work quality. Today, investment managers can point to a number of successes in adopting office automation.    &quot;We've had explosive growth since the late 1970s,&quot; says Howard Stein, chairman of Dreyfus Corp. &quot;New technology helps us handle it.&quot;    Stock-picking and securities research, for example, have been transformed by personal computers over the past few years. Analysts can comfortably follow far more stocks, in far more sophisticated ways, than they could before. An analyst specializing in food stocks, for example, can see instantly how a sugar-price rise would affect different companies' earnings next year -- or in the 1990s. Five years ago, such calculations would have been so laborious, few analysts would have bothered.    Trading departments say new computer systems have helped them cope with the recent surges in trading volume. The biggest money managers now make as many as 2,000 trades a day, more than triple the volume 10 years ago. And rather than wait for traditional weekly portfolio updates, managers now get constant data on changes in their portfolios' value and composition.    Client services have been improved by investment managers using computers. When California's state pension plan was looking for new money managers last year, it received computer floppy disks with sample portfolios from 94 candidates. That helped California evaluate the managers' stock-picking skills faster than would have been the case with written materials.    But some technological barriers in the investment business remain unscaled, notably in mutual funds, says Ron Valeggia, head of computer services at Alliance Capital Management Corp. &quot;There isn't any off-the-shelf software that can handle a million different accounts,&quot; he says. So most mutual fund groups are still wrestling with better ways to speed information to clients.    In some ways, money management provides an unnaturally easy environment for office automation. For one thing, investment management is filled with bright young MBAs who were weaned on computers. &quot;I'd say 80% of the staff here is computer literate,&quot; says Katie Ellis, a marketing specialist at Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management Inc. in New York. &quot;When I got here, I was using Lotus (an integrated spreadsheet program) on Day 2, and dBase (a database program) on Day 3.&quot;    Also, by its very nature, investment management is numbers-oriented, lending itself to analytical computer techniques. And the money management business has been growing so fast -- and so profitably -- that participants can afford to buy almost any new technology they want, without worrying much about cost.    &quot;When you get right down to it, this is an information business,&quot; says Tom Mack, head of computer systems at Mitchell Hutchins. &quot;Anything that increases delivery of information, within reason, is an advantage to us.&quot;    Telecommunications also has been an area for upgrading. The leading money managers have spent extra to get priority routing on overseas calls, so they can more easily manage money globally. Even the traditional &quot;squawk box&quot; that firms use for addressing branch offices has been replaced by expensive electronic gear providing superior sound quality.    The one area where technology hasn't always excelled is in improving actual portfolio returns. Plenty of money managers say they can handle more clients -- using more sophisticated products like options, futures and new debt instruments -- with new office technology. Yet &quot;there are only a few guys who are really outperforming the market averages thanks to their computer models,&quot; says Dreyfus's Mr. Stein. For the rest, office technology may be a great convenience, but no shortcut to investment genius.
