Officials of the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration said that the matter is under review here and that citations are likely by July 24. Preparation of the OSHA case was reported this week by the news media in Providence, R.I., and Boston.    Substantial fines are likely to be proposed. A union official and an Electric Boat employee said OSHA has indicated the penalties could exceed $1 million, but some OSHA officials suggested the amount could be much less than that. No amount has yet been determined, no final decision has been made on what violations should be cited, and no formal citation has been prepared, an OSHA spokesman said.    A General Dynamics spokesman said OSHA hadn't yet notified the company of the results of its inquiry, and he declined to comment further. But a source close to General Dynamics said the company understood the fine would be about $500,000.    The enforcement action is part of an OSHA crackdown on workplace violations that has focused mainly on paper-work omissions, such as the ones being investigated in the General Dynamics case. In recent months, OSHA has collected $295,000 from Chrysler Corp. on record-keeping charges, and has proposed penalties of $1.3 million against Union Carbide Corp., Danbury, Conn., and $776,000 against Caterpillar Inc., Peoria, Ill., for similar alleged violations.    Chrysler also agreed last week to pay $1.6 million to settle government charges that went beyond paper-work violations. Chrysler didn't admit guilt to OSHA allegations of worker overexposure to lead and arsenic, failure to notify employes of exposure to work hazards and other health and safety violations.    Kipp Hartman, director of OSHA's Providence office, said agency investigators have identified 120 &quot;apparent&quot; reporting violations in the General Dynamics case. But he also said OSHA hasn't decided how many violations should be included in any citation, or how seriously they should be classified.    OSHA can levy fines of as much as $10,000 for each violation. The maximum amount is assessed for willful violations, which involve a company's knowingly breaking the rules or being aware of a hazardous condition and making no reasonable effort to correct it.    The General Dynamics investigation began early this year after a coalition of three unions seeking to organize the Electric Boat shipyard prepared a list of workers the unions said were injured or became ill on the job in 1985 and 1986 without the company making the required reports to OSHA. The union group, the United Shipbuilding Crafts, sought an OSHA inspection.    David Pizzorno, a torch-cutter machine operator at Electric Boat, said the inspection resulted from a formal complaint filed by him. </TEXT></DOC>
