High Commissioner for Refugees shouldcall an international conference to stem a ``chain reaction'' amongSoutheast Asian countries toward cutting off temporary asylum forpeople fleeing Vietnam, a private U.S. refugee relief organizationsaid Friday.   The United States, which has taken in about 1 million refugeesfrom Indochina, must strongly support the move, said theWashington-based U.S. Committee for Refugees.   Unless the U.S. government gives the problem new priority, itwill be to blame for ``permitting a vital, humanitarian initiativeto drift into dissolution,'' the group added.   ``Thailand lit the fuse in January, when it began to push backVietnamese boats from its eastern and southern coastlines,''committee director Roger Winter said in a statement.   ``What we are seeing now is the predictable chain reaction tobar asylum throughout the region,'' he said, citing increasedresistance to temporary asylum on the part of Indonesia, Malaysia,Hong Kong and the Philippines.   ``We have known for some time that Indonesia has been pushingboats back'' to sea, but the first evidence that it was costinglives came April 24, when Indonesian soldiers shot and killed onerefugee and wounded another as a boat carrying 125 people attemptedto land, Winter said.   The vessel finally managed to land at the Malaysian camp ofPulau Bidong four days later, he said. But he added that Malaysiahas announced it will close this camp within a year and intends``no longer to adopt a soft attitude to these illegal immigrants.''   Hong Kong and the Philippines also are reviewing their temporaryasylum policies, Winter said, declaring, ``first asylum countriesin the region are seeking a new, restrictive consensus'' ontightening of their policies.   He gave these data on refugee problems since the start of 1988:   _Thailand: More than 1,500 Vietnamese have been pushed back inoperations that caused 170 deaths.   _Malaysia: In the first quarter of the year, 2,921 Vietnameselanded.   _Hong Kong: The year began with a camp population of 9,532, morethan 40 percent of whom had been in camps more than three years. AHong Kong official has urged that future arrivals be detained forreturn to Vietnam.   The U.S. State Department has said it is in close consultationwith Thailand and other governments on the ``boat people'' problem.   Malaysia's ambassador to Washington, Albert Talalla, said thisweek that his country is ``reaching the end of our tether'' inproviding first asylum, and pressure should be brought againstHanoi to ``stop this exodus.'' Talalla also commended the UnitedStates as being ``the most generous'' of any country in providingpermanent resettlement to follow temporary asylum.</TEXT></DOC>
