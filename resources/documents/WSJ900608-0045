Mr. Greenwald, who quit as Chrysler's vice chairman lastweek, received a $5 million bonus for signing on with thebuyout group, according to people familiar with hiscompensation. He will receive an additional $4 million feeeven if the takeover isn't completed.</LP><TEXT>   The big payments are part of a five-year contract Mr.Greenwald negotiated with United Airline's three unionsbefore agreeing last Wednesday to spearhead their takeovereffort. Under that agreement, the 54-year-old executive beganearning a $1.2 million annual salary the day the contract wassigned.   If the transaction is completed, Mr. Greenwald willreceive a &quot;success fee&quot; of $1.2 million in addition to hisregular salary in the first year of the contract.   Mr. Greenwald, who is slated to become UAL's chairman ifthe employees take control, was in a strong bargainingposition since there is no guarantee the buy-out willsucceed. The unions had sought to keep terms of the agreementsecret. However, details of the pay package began to emergeas the effort enters a critical stage.   Mr. Greenwald and the unions' advisers are about to thebegin formal discussions with banks over financing for the$4.38 billion so that they can meet a financing deadline ofAug. 9. The buy-out group is also in the last stages ofnegotiations with United's nonunionized employees whosesupport is considered critical to the effort.   The unions have proposed that the noncontract employeescontribute as much as $55 million in annual wage concessionsto fund the buy-out.   Some employees are raising questions about Mr. Greenwald'slevel of compensation, especially since workers will have totake wage cuts to provide &quot;sweat equity&quot; for the buy-out.However, one leader of the nonunionized employees called Mr.Greenwald's deal &quot;no worse than what goes on in baseball.&quot;   Spokesmen for United's three unions declined to comment onMr. Greenwald's contract. Mr. Greenwald couldn't be reached,but has declined in the past to discuss his compensation.   Union officials have indicated previously that thefinancial package was structured to compensate for potentialincome and benefits Mr. Greenwald was giving up at Chrysler,where he was in line to succeed Chairman Lee A. Iacocca. Theynote than UAL paid current Chairman Stephen M. Wolf a $6.7million bonus to take the job three years ago.   One union adviser characterized as &quot;perfectly natural&quot; theportion of the agreement guaranteeing Mr. Greenwald a fee ifthe transaction fails.   At Chrysler, Mr. Greenwald received an annual salary of$1.1 million. According to 1990 proxy materials, he held47,647 Chrysler shares and had options to buy $21,625 more atprices ranging from $13.98 to $25.88. Chrysler stock closedat $16.125 yesterday in composite trading on the New YorkStock Exchange.   The UAL agreement also provides Mr. Greenwald with stockin the airline. It couldn't be determined how big of a stakeMr. Greenwald would receive. As currently contemplated, theemployees would own 100% of United Airlines if the buy-outsucceeds.   Discussions with the nonunionized employees are expectedto come to a head within the next few days. The buy-out isstructured so that it could proceed without the participationof the 26,000 non-contract employees. But it would hurt thebuy-out group if dissent among the ranks surfaced duringfinancing negotiations with the banks.   The buy-out group is also close to finalizing a proposedslate of directors should the buy-out succeed. The unionsasked Spencer Stuart Associates, an executive search firm, torecommend eight outside directors for the 15-member board.   The unions want to have a slate of directors in hand inorder to convince banks that Mr. Greenwald and the board, notthe unions, will govern the company. One official familiarwith the deliberations said the unions want to keep somecurrent UAL directors, believing that will enhance theirchances with the banks.   Mr. Greenwald and three union representatives will alsosit on the board.</TEXT></DOC>
