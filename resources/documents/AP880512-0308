But some economists say the specter ofrising prices is highly exaggerated.   These economists argue that unlike the 1970s, when price spiralsbecame ingrained, the economy of the 1980s has been reshaped byfundamental changes that have restrained costs and wages, two keycomponents of inflation.   Moreover, their reasoning goes, the highly competitive globaleconomy and higher U.S. productivity provide compelling evidencethat acute inflation will not revisit the United States in theforseeable future.   ``There's a very slow learning process in the markets,'' saidJohn Hekman, senior economist at the Claremont Economics Institute,a forecasting firm in Claremont, Calif., that rejects the prevalentthinking about inflation fear. ``We've had inflation scares everyyear.''   Unfounded or not, this anxiety has helped wrench down stock andbond prices and raise long-term Treasury yields to the highestlevels of 1988. The Federal Reserve has been maneuvering to tightencredit as a preemptive step to thwart inflation, and on Wednesdaybanks responded by raising their prime lending rates.   To some degree, economists say, inflation anxiety results fromthe stock market crash seven months ago. After the collapse the Fedused a mix of confidence-building public statements and biginjections of money into the banking system to quell fears that arecession loomed.   Since then the economy has shown surprising strength, but theuncertainty raised by the crash has lingered. Many investors nowsay they fear a rapidly expanding economy, because it would meanhigher wages, more demand for credit and too much money chasing toofew goods. That translates into inflation.   The economists who dispute that view argue that wages have notrisen, despite the lowest unemployment in 14 years. On thecontrary, wages have fallen in some areas relative to inflation,which last year totaled 4.4 percent and for the first three monthsof this year ran at an annual rate of 4.2 percent.   ``Labor costs have remained meek and mild,'' said RichardBelous, a labor economist at the Conference Board, abusiness-financed economic research group in New York. ``Ifinflationary costs start getting imbedded in labor costs, then theballgame's over, but I don't think it's happening.''   The primary reason for this, Belous and others say, is that thelabor market is radically different now. Many companies haverestructured into smaller, leaner operations with non-unionworkers. Moreover, many Americans are employed in temporary andpart-time jobs that offer relatively low wages, little job securityand often no benefits.   ``Management is now playing hardball with labor,'' Belous said.``It can't just pass costs on to the consumer. Markets arederegulated, there's more competition. We're part of a globaleconomy.''   Richard Rahn, economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce inWashington, argues that inflation worriers are using outdatedeconomic formulas for assuming that lower unemployment translatesinto rising prices.   On the contrary, he said, higher employment means higherproduction, which equals lower prices.   ``This is logical when you think about it. If you produce moreof something, each unit tends to cost less. Rapidly growingeconomies tend to have declining cost curves,'' Rahn said. ``Justbecause the unemployment rate is coming down doesn't translate intoinflation. So I'm arguing the analysis is dead wrong.''   Asked why inflation paranoia has afflicted the markets, Rahnsaid: ``I think the experience of the late 1970s was very searing.Clearly we don't want to repeat that.''   Some economists argue that sharply higher factory utilizationrates portend inflation because they imply supply will not keep upwith demand, thereby pressuring prices up. But others say that isalso outdated thinking.   ``The idea that a lot of industries are close to capacity isjust a measure of their improved efficiency,'' said Hekman. ``Thesepeople are not about to let inflation get away from them.''</TEXT></DOC>
