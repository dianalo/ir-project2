Themodel was developed to address queueing, scheduling, materials handling,and transportation problems. A functional model of the proposed retrievaloperations formed the basis of the conceptual design. From the foundationformed by the functional model, the simulation model was constructed.The simulation model is presented through a brief description of theselected simulation language and then its application to the BWP-RPM.Detailed listings of the simulation code, and model output are included.2 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
