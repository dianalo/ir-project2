(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An environmental dispute between NorthCarolina and Tennessee took a new twist when two legislators heredecided to ``fight fire with firewater'' by proposing a ban onTennessee liquor.   State Sen. Dennis Winner said he wanted to let Tennessee leadersknow that their decision to stop a North Carolina company fromdumping wastewater into the Pigeon River would have economicramifications in both states.   ``I'm not trying to knock them to their knees,'' Winner said.``The basic problem is they don't think they have anything to lose.''   Winner and state Sen. Bob Swain introduced a bill Wednesday thatwould ban the sale in North Carolina of any liquor manufactured inTennessee or purchased from a Tennessee vendor.   ``There's no revenge involved,'' said Swain, tongue in cheek. ``Ijust think ol' Tennessee liquor is bad for people.''   The bill is the latest salvo in an increasingly bitter feudbetween the states over Tennessee's refusal to grant ChampionInternational Co. a permit to discharge wastewater into the PigeonRiver at its Canton paper mill.   The Pigeon flows from North Carolina into Tennessee, skirting thenortheastern border of Great Smoky Mountains National Park.   In response to concerns by residents of Cocke County, Tenn.,officials in Tennessee announced Dec. 23 they would not grant avariance allowing the North Carolina plant to continue dumping intothe river.   A Champion official announced this week that operations at themill would be scaled back as a result of Tennessee's decision,threatening the jobs of 1,000 people.   Nonetheless, a spokesman for Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter saidthe decision not to grant the variance is final.   ``What North Carolina does, I guess, is North Carolina'sbusinesss,'' said Ken Renner, the spokesman. ``About the onlysimilarity between Tennessee whiskey and Pigeon River water isthey're about the same color.''   The liquor bill quickly inspired jokes and puns in the halls ofNorth Carolina's Legislative Building, including talk of ``fightingfire with firewater.''   A spokesman for the North Carolina Alcoholic Beverage ControlCommission estimated that more than 1 million bottles of Tennesseewhiskey are sold in the state each year.   Winner said he chose to target Tennessee liquor to avoidconflicting with the U.S. Constitution's provision forbidding statesfrom restricting interstate commerce.   The courts have ruled that the 21st Amendment allows states toregulate liquor traffic within their borders and that it supersedesthe interstate commerce clause, he said.   A spokesman for the Jack Daniels distillery in Lynchburg, Tenn.,said he was only vaguely familiar with the Champion controversy, butthe proposed liquor ban was troubling.   ``We're not too happy, I don't guess,'' said spokesman RogerBrashears. ``It don't make us too pleased.''</TEXT></DOC>
