But on Friday the Fed eased rates; the Dow JonesIndustrial Average climbed to yet another record high, evenbriefly tiptoeing across the 3000 mark for the first time.But have the stock market's worries about profits gone away-- or even moderated?</LP><TEXT>   Not likely. &quot;When the market wasn't doing well, peoplefelt rates were going up and earnings were going down,&quot; saysByron Wien, U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley andamp;Co., who predicted at the start of this year that theindustrials would reach 3000 in the second half. Now, hesays, investors' fears of higher rates and slumping profitsare easing.   But for the market to make major progress from here, Mr.Wien says, rates will have to come down even more, orearnings will have to go up. And since the latter isn'tlikely to happen in a big way, the push will have to comefrom lower interest rates, he says.   On Friday, the Federal Reserve pushed the federal fundsrate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, tojust over 8% from 8 1/4%, making good on Chairman AlanGreenspan's remark Thursday that rates would have to fall toalleviate a credit crunch. But, as promised, the cut wasmodest -- too modest to cheer investors about the prospect ofa surge in economic growth that would significantly helpcorporate earnings.   A quarter-point move &quot;in the fed funds rate isn't likelyto engender much more than a marginal improvement incorporate profitability,&quot; says Brian J. Fabbri, chiefeconomist at Midland Montagu Economics.   In terms of truly stimulating economic growth andtherefore corporate profits, &quot;it's the effect on the consumerthat counts,&quot; Mr. Fabbri says. And a quarterpoint dropprobably won't lead to the kind of bank-loan rate cuts thatmight make consumers feel better about consuming, he says.   It would probably take another quarter-point drop in thefederal funds rate to inspire banks to cut the prime rate,the benchmark lending rate, Mr. Fabbri says.   Peter Anderson, president of IDS Advisory Group, aMinneapolis money management firm, says he believes the Fed'sinterest rate moves will do little to help corporateprofitability in the short term. That's because the Fed willuse interest rates only to stave off a recession -- not tostimulate the economy in its present condition, he says.   For example, if Congress reaches an accord soon that lops$50 billion or $60 billion off the budget deficit, the Fedmay allow interest rates to fall further, but only to offsetthe economic damage that would be done by the tax increasesand spending cuts such an accord doubtless would include, Mr.Anderson says.   Still, despite interest-rate concerns, some analysts thinkthe stock market has room to move up. Mr. Anderson says theDow industrials could rise well past 3000 this year. Ifearnings on the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index total $26to $27 a share this year, while investors are comfortablewith stocks selling at 15 times earnings, that would equateto an industrial average of about 3250.   &quot;Eventually, at the turn of the year, investors willbecome more value-oriented in the market,&quot; Mr. Anderson says.&quot;People's concerns about earnings erosion will begin todissipate.&quot;   Edward M. Kerschner of PaineWebber thinks the Fed's creditease could give companies reason to believe &quot;capital will bereasonably available for sound and ordinary business needs. .. . This easier policy could give the profit outlook a boostlater this year and into 1991. Businesses that had beenreluctant or even unable to move ahead because of fears ofunavailable credit will now find those concerns mitigated.&quot;   He predicts the stock market could move up an additional10% to 20% over the next 12 to 18 months, putting the DJIA ata fully valued 3250 to 3550. But that will only happen ifrates fall another half percentage point, Mr. Kerschner says.   Other analysts are more cautious. Ricky Harrington,director of asset management at Marion Bass Securities,Charlotte, N.C., worries that &quot;the Dow is making new highs,yet we continue to have narrow breadth. . . . That doesn'tmean we can't move to 3100, but it means you take a somewhatdefensive approach to this market. Right now, money managersare all playing the same game. They are all buying the samestocks. If they're not buying Procter andamp; Gamble, then they aresitting on the sidelines.&quot;   And in the short term, the outlook for interest ratescontinues to worry many analysts.   Late last year, Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at FirstFidelity Bancorp., envisioned that by now the economy wouldbe showing lower inflation, lower interest rates andcorporate profits flattening out after declining. Althoughinflation may be ready to fall and profits are improvingsome, the interest rate picture remains troublesome, he says.   &quot;A mere quarter-point decline in the fed funds rate willnot reinvigorate the economy,&quot; Mr. Levy says, &quot;nor will itamelioriate the credit conditions Greenspan spoke about.&quot; Hesays the credit crunch has to do with softening credit demandassociated with the weak economy. &quot;Better now to be investedin companies whose earnings are certain to meetexpectations,&quot; he says. &quot;In the near term, we need thoseprofits to sustain the recent stock market gains.&quot;   David B. Bostian Jr., chief investment strategist atJesup, Josephthal andamp; Co., notes that the stock market'sinitial response to the Fed's easing &quot;was euphoric, and inthe short term, investors forgot about all of the earningsconcerns.&quot;   But this week, &quot;the market may refocus on earnings,&quot; hesays. It probably would take another half-point interest ratecut to generate enough &quot;economic buoyancy&quot; to help corporateprofits.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          The stock market continued its record-setting rally inheavy trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average pokingthrough 3000 for the first time.   But although the average established its second straightrecord high, it didn't hold above that mark as profit-takingand futures-related selling sent the market well below thehighs of the session in late trading.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which surpassed 3000just after 1:30 p.m. on its way to an intraday gain of morethan 33 points, finished 10.40 higher at 2980.20. For theweek, the average posted a gain of 75.25 points, or 2.6%.   The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index alsoestablished a record high by climbing 1.01 to 200.33,breaking the previous mark of 200.21, set June 4.   Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones EquityMarket Index finished just below their all-time peaks as aresult of the market's pullback.   The Sandamp;P 500 added 1.87 to 367.31 and the Dow Jones EquityMarket Index gained 1.60 to 341.22; their record highs of367.40 and 341.98, respectively, were also set June 4.   For the week, the Sandamp;P 500 rose 2.5% and the New York StockExchange Composite rose 2.3%, as did the Dow Jones EquityMarket Index.   Big Board volume totaled 215.6 million shares, marking thefirst time since midMay that the exchange posted back-to-backsessions of more than 200 million shares. On Thursday, 211.5million shares changed hands.   Indications that the Federal Reserve is moving in thedirection of lower interest rates fueled the market's latestrally, traders said, as did several waves of programs linkedto stock-index arbitrage. But index-arbitrage selling --where traders sell stocks and offset the positions in futuresto capture fleeting price differences -- surfaced in thefinal hour of trading to weigh down the market. The Dow JonesUtilities Average, seen as an interest-rate barometer, closed0.32 lower at 206.17.   Although utility stocks were left out of the market'srally, the Dow Jones Transportation Average jumped 22.63 to1187.59 as railroad and airline issues posted especiallysharp gains.   Railroad stocks rallied after Salomon Brothers commentedfavorably on the short-term prospects for the sector. AnalystMichael Lloyd told Dow Jones Professional Investor Reportthat industry traffic was stronger than expected last month,and he singled out two railroad firms as beneficiaries:Norfolk Southern, which rose 1/4 to 45 1/8, and ConsolidatedRail, which climbed 1 1/2 to 50 5/8.   Conrail also was the subject of positive comments fromPaineWebber analyst Anthony Hatch, who told the investorreport his second-quarter earnings estimate of $1.22 a share&quot;might be well short by as much as 20 cents a share&quot; becauseof its strong June traffic.   USAir Group paced the rally in the airline sector byadvancing 1 1/2 to 25 3/4. AMR, the owner of AmericanAirlines, gained 2 to 63 3/8; UAL, the owner of UnitedAirlines, rose 1 to 160 3/4; Delta Air Lines gained 5/8 to 741/4; Southwest Airlines added 1/2 to 27 1/2, and Alaska AirGroup rose 3/4 to 23 1/2.   Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntalandamp; Co., said the rally in transportation stocks is &quot;giving thesigns of confirmation that we want&quot; in terms of the DowTheory. The theory holds that an advance in the Dowtransportation average lends support to a rally in the DowJones Industrial Average.   Precious-metals stocks, buoyed by a rise in gold prices,also were especially strong; August gold futures climbed $6an ounce, to $365.70, in New York trading.   Battle Mountain Gold rose 5/8 to 11 1/2, Homestake Miningadded 5/8 to 18 3/8, Newmont Mining went up 1 1/2 to 46,Placer Dome gained 3/8 to 16 3/8, ASA Ltd. advanced 1 3/4 to47 1/2 and American Barrick Resources added 7/8 to 20.

Accor, a Frenchhotel, catering and tourism company, agreed to acquire Motel6 for $22.50 a unit.   Castle andamp; Cooke, which said several major companies haveexpressed interest in acquiring its Dole Food unit, rallied 6to 36 1/2 as 2 million shares changed hands. The companyretained Goldman Sachs as an adviser on the possible sale ofDole.   Computer Associates International was second on the mostactives list as trading remained heavy in the wake of itsstatement Thursday that second-quarter revenue dropped&quot;substantially&quot; from a year ago and earnings may also belower. The stock, which plummeted 6 1/2 Thursday, droppedanother 3/8 to 9 7/8 on 6.5 million shares.   Sears Roebuck fell 3/8 to 34 1/4 after estimating thatsecond-quarter earnings from continuing operations would be65 cents a share, down from 95 cents a year earlier.   Alcan Aluminium slipped 5/8 to 23 1/4 on 2.4 millionshares. The company reported that second-quarter earningsdropped 65.6% from a year earlier; the latest results fellshort of analysts' expectations.   Genentech went down 1/2 to 29 after reporting thatsecond-quarter net income fell 44.8% from a year earlier. Thecompany also said it expects to record a loss for the year,reflecting costs tied to its merger with Roche Holdings ofSwitzerland.   Nynex lost 5/8 to 78. The staff of the New York PublicService Commission recommended that the regulatory panelrequire the company's New York Telephone unit, which isrequesting a $919 million rate increase for next year, toinstead reduce rates by $81 million.</TEXT></DOC>
