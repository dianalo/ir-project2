The Supreme Soviet also gave President Mikhail S. Gorbachevsweeping new powers to implement the reforms unilaterally.   But the lawmakers continued to disagree on which of severalcompeting economic blueprints for accomplishing the switch shouldbe followed.   After a confusing and tumultuous debate, the Supreme Sovietsettled on a resolution calling for a committee of legislators andeconomists appointed by Gorbachev to merge the various recipes intoa unified plan by Oct. 15. The vote was 323-11, with 56abstentions.   Although differences remained, it was the first time the SupremeSoviet had committed the country to switching to a market economyin hopes of ending chronic shortages of everything from housing tobread and arresting inflation and a soaring budget deficit.   When the resolution was approved, there was no applause or otherdisplay of emotion, not even by Gorbachev, sitting alone on araised stage in a marble Kremlin meeting hall.   Hours later the parliament approved 305-46, with 41 abstentions,Gorbachev's request for broad emergency poers to carry outreforms. It gave him the authority until March 1992 to bypassstep-by-step legislative scrutiny and issue decrees on property,management of the economy, the budget and law and order.   The legislature would have the power to recommend Gorbachevcancel or modify the decrees, which the president said he wouldbegin issuing soon.   Several lawmakers feared they were giving Gorbachev too muchpower, and one said it would make him a ``monarch.''   But in an animated 15-minute speech, Gorbachev vowed to exercisehis new powers with ``full responsibility.''   ``It's a responsibility. It's not a tea party,'' he said.   The adopted resolution endorses a compromise program backed byGorbachev, but calls for incorporating a more conservative recipeof Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov.   Lawmakers later agreed they should also try to include parts ofa more radical plan approved by the Russian Federation, the largestof the 15 Soviet republics, led by Russian President Boris N.Yeltsin.   Yeltsin is Gorbachev's chief political rival, and his parliamenthas set the pace on reforming an economy so inefficient that cropsspoil on their way to market and plants stand idle for lack ofspare parts.   ``We can and must come out with a single program for switchingto a market economy,'' Gorbachev said. He said the goal is``maximum accord in society and not confrontation.''   Ryzhkov, facing mounting calls for his resignation, said thevote left ``no victors and no defeated.''   ``This is a compromise,'' he said in an interview.   Sergei Stankevich, Moscow's deputy mayor and a nationallegislator, said Gorbachev's insistence on unifying the competingprograms would lead ``not to consolidation but to collapse.''   Consumer shortages are widespread and worsening, most recentlyincluding bread, and there is fear of economic collapse.   Gorbachev's program would reverse the direction that the SovietUnion has taken since the Bolshevik Revolution, especially Stalin'sforced collectivization, which claimed the lives of some 7 millionpeople.   It would create a federation of republics with economies builton private businesses, individually owned farms and stock marketstrading shares in competitive companies.   The program marks a significant change in Gorbachev's tactics.His perestroika program had been aimed at ``restructuring''centralized socialism, but now is apparently moving towarddestroying it.   Lawmakers had been scheduled to vote on Friday, but failed tomuster a quorum and had to adjourn until today. Gorbachev expressedfrustration at the time, saying there was no more time to ``talk,think, try and experiment.''   Several participants in today's debate proposed that thenational legislature shun the attempt at a compromise and endorseinstead the most radical reform plan under consideration - that ofeconomist Stanislav Shatalin.   ``There can be no compromise between the programs of thegovernment, the president and the Shatalin group,'' the 56-year-oldShatalin told the legislature.   Outside the Kremlin, protesters gathered to expressdisappointment in Gorbachev's handling of the economic crisis.Dozens of sign-carrying protesters chanted slogans at legislatorsas they arrived for the morning debate.   ``The people don't trust Gorbachev,'' about a dozendemonstrators shouted outside the Kremlin's Spassky Gate.   They held signs that read ``A president - not an emperor'' and``All decrees of the president are battles against democracy.''   Ryzhkov, who has become a lightning rod for the growing publicunrest, predicted on Soviet television Sunday night that the moveto a market economy will take years, not 500 days.   He confirmed ``very serious'' problems in bringing this year'sbumper harvest to market. He said at most only one-third of cropshave so far been harvested.</TEXT></DOC>
