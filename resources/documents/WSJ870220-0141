A tender offer by the affiliate, JMC Acquisition Corp., expired Feb. 3.    As previously reported, Joy, a Pittsburgh-based maker of oil-field and coal-mining equipment, thwarted a bid for the company by Pullman-Peabody Co. by arranging to take the company private through a buyout led by Adler andamp; Shaykin, a New York investment firm. Pullman-Peabody, based in Princeton, N.J., is a maker of material-handling and food-service equipment.    In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired by a small group of investors in a transaction financed largely through borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
