A hotel manager in Yerevan, reached by telephone from Moscow,said, ``Everything is quiet'' in the capital city where at leastfive days of street protests brought an appeal by Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev for restraint.   A telephone operator in Yerevan also said the demonstrations hadended. Efforts to contact Armenian nationalist leaders wereunsuccessful. Both the operator and the hotel manager spoke oncondition they not be identified.   There was no direct word on the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh,the autonomous region where members of the ethnic Armenian majoritybegan the demonstrations to protest the Soviet Communist Party'srejection of a proposal to give the region back to Armenia. It hasbeen designated part of the neighboring republic of Azerbaidzhansince 1923.   Most telephone calls to Yerevan have been cut off since thedemonstrations began, and foreign reporters have been preventedfrom traveling to the small republic on the Turkish border.   Gorbachev's appeal, read on Armenian and Azerbaidzhanian radioand television Friday by a Central Committee official, wasaccompanied by a pledge from local party officials to ask theMoscow-based Communist Party Central Committee to reconsider theterritorial issue.   Reports from Armenia said that after the appeal, thedemonstrators in Yerevan, said by some to have numbered up to 1million, began to disperse.   A Washington-based group calling itself the Armenian NationalCommittee of America quoted telephone reports from the region assaying Nagorno-Karabakh's main city, Stepanakert, had been turnedinto a tent city by Armenian villagers from the countryside.   The group claimed Azerbaidzhanis had killed 70 Armenians in theregion and that Soviet troops were stationed around Stepanakert toprevent further ethnic violence. There have been other reports ofdeaths in the region, but they have not been confirmed.   Relations between Azerbaidzhan, a predominantly Moslem republic,and mainly Christian Armenia have been tense for some time. Lastweek, there were disturbances in the contested autonomous region,where the population is three-quarters Armenian, and they spread toYerevan.   The protests brought concessions from regional Communist Partyleaders. They named a 56-year-old Armenian, Genrikh Pogosyan, tohead the party in Nagorno-Karabakh, replacing Boris Kevorkov whoalso is an ethnic Armenian but apparently less popular thanPogosyan.</TEXT></DOC>
