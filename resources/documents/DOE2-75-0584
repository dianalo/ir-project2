Hydrogen abstraction from these substrates by the OHradical yields the cyclohexadienyl radical ({epsilon}(310 nm) = 4400dm/sup 3/ mol/sup -1/ cm/sup -1/ from the reaction of the H atom withbenzene) with an efficiency of 50% (0.29 {mu}mol J/sup -1/) in the caseof 1,4-cyclohexadiene and 25% (0.15 {mu}mol J/sup -1/) in the case of1,3-cyclohexadiene as determined by pulse radiolysis. The remaining OHradicals add to the olefin. In 1,4-cyclohexadiene the yield of the resultingadduct radicals has been determined in a steady-state /sup 60/Co-{gamma}-irradiationexperiment by reducing it with added 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) to 4-hydroxycyclohexene.There are two sites of OH radical attack in the case of 1,3-cyclohexadiene,and only the alkyl radical is reduced quantitatively by DTT (G(3-hydroxycyclohexene)= 0.15 {mu}mol J/sup -1/). From material balance considerations it isconcluded that the allylic radical must be formed with a G value of 0.28{mu}mol J/sup -1/ but largely escapes reduction by DTT (G(4-hydroxycyclohexene)= 0.03 {mu}mol J/sup -1/). H atoms add preferentially to the double bondsof 1,4- and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (78% and 93%, respectively), while theO/sup -/ radical (the basic form of the OH radical) undergoes mainlyH-abstraction (92% and 83%, respectively).</TEXT></DOC>
