MCI insists that ATandamp;Tmisrepresented MCI's offer to La Quinta, which makes the ATandamp;Toffer an inaccurate response.andP;  The FCC has been trying to make adefinitive ruling on the Tariff 15 issue since 1988, but says itmust do further research and analysis to determine whether Tariff15 deals are legal.andP;  ATandamp;T defends its actions by relying on thelegal principle known as the competitive necessity doctrine, whichjustifies single-customer deals in the event that a rival willotherwise win the customer over.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   La Quinta Motor Inns Inc.
