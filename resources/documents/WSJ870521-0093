In a plan designed to standardize the rules, a blue-ribbon academy panel recommended that the Environmental Protection Agency, which enforces the laws, adopt a new &quot;negligible risk&quot; standard. That standard would allow approval of pesticides in cases where they would cause tumors in less than one out of every million people exposed.    But the committee said the new rules would eliminate more risks of cancer than current regulations. And it urged the EPA to apply the new standard across the board -- for example, to older pesticides and to fresh foods, neither of which currently is covered.    The report is the first challenge in years to the Delaney provision of the 1954 Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which governs pesticides in foods. It sparked immediate reaction from government officials and environmental and industry groups.    The 255-page document, prepared by a committee of scientists under the agency's National Research Council, criticizes the current approach, in which the EPA essentially bans all pesticide residues in processed foods that become concentrated during processing, whenever any risk of cancer is evident. This has brought about &quot;a crazy-quilt pattern of rules and regulations&quot; that often leads to &quot;paradoxical, indefensible results,&quot; the report said.    Current procedures are further complicated because the EPA hasn't enforced the regulations to cover pesticides registered before 1978, when the federal government began requiring more detailed health information. Nor does the Delaney provision apply at all to raw agricultural products.    The panel contended that applying the new, negligible risk standard would eliminate 98% of the cancer risk from 28 pesticides that the EPA has linked to cancer, while banning only 32% of their potential uses. By contrast, the panel said, current standards wipe out only about half the estimated cancer-risk from these compounds.    The EPA, which commissioned the study as part of its own efforts to evaluate current regulations, called the panel's proposals &quot;sound.&quot; John Moore, assistant EPA administrator for pesticides and toxic substances, said the agency would respond formally in about 90 days, and could begin applying new standards in some cases as early as August. The agency is nearing decisions on how to regulate hundreds of pesticides that were registered for use before detailed information on their cancer-causing potential was available.    The House and Senate agriculture committees also pledged prompt action to overhaul the laws affecting the regulation of pesticides.    At the same time, William Schultz, a food and drug specialist for Public Citizen, the Washington-based consumer advocate organization, argued that the EPA should focus on banning older pesticides it previously has exempted. &quot;Delaney isn't the problem,&quot; added Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, another Washington-based consumer group. &quot;EPA inaction is the problem.&quot;    The EPA has been moving slowly to review the registration of the older chemicals. Many are known to cause cancer and face a possible ban. The academy committee said 31 apparently violate the Delaney provision.    Meanwhile, industry groups urged more caution. Jack Early, president of the National Agricultural Chemicals Association, suggested that EPA appoint its own high-level panel to review the Academy of Sciences' new report.    In its criticism of the Delaney clause, the academy panel said it saw no scientific justification to apply a tighter standard to regulation of a chemical simply because a food becomes more concentrated during processing, nor to hold chemicals to a lesser standard because they are used on unprocessed foods. The current law, it said, can lead to tighter restrictions on compounds that pose relatively little cancer risk.    The committee recommended that the EPA focus its reviews on pesticides thought to pose the greatest risk. To avoid inadvertently encouraging the use of more hazardous substitutes, it urged simultaneous reviews of substitute compounds that are linked to cancer.    The report estimated that the risk of getting cancer from any single pesticide residue is no more than one in 1,000. Ray Thornton, president of the University of Arkansas and chairman of the committee, added, &quot;The potential cancer risks from pesticides in the diet are small in comparison to other known causes of cancer.&quot;    Residues in tomatoes appear to pose the greatest risk of cancer, the report said, followed by those in beef, potatoes, oranges and lettuce. But the committee said such calculations are fraught with uncertainty.    The report blamed fungicides for causing 60% of the estimated dietary cancer risk from pesticides, with nine leading fungicides contributing about equally. It traced 27% of the risk to herbicides and only 13% to insecticides, and said most of these hazards could be eliminated by banning three compounds: the herbicide linuron, trade name Lorox, and the insecticides chlordimeform and permethrin. </TEXT></DOC>
