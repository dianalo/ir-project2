As chef aboard the VeniceSimplon Orient-Express, he has to fit into some tight spots. His kitchens, forexample.;   As most everyone knows, the Orient-Express is the epitome ofluxury, and that includes the food. And because there is not a lot of actionon board the train (no swimming pool, no shuffleboard courts!), food on theOrient-Express assumes an importance that goes beyond the usual cruise orresort vacation. Eating and drinking become the primary activities as thetrain hurtles the 835 miles from Venice to Paris.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Travel  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE ORIENT-EXPRESS' TASTY TRIP THROUGH THE ALPS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Railroads; Carol Haddix is editor of the Chicago Tribune's Food Guide.  </MEMO><TEXT>     And Chef Bodiguel is up to the challenge of providing gourmet fare thatmeets the Orient-Express's reputation for top-of-the-line luxury.;   Despitehis kitchens.;   Each measures 8 by 10 feet and much of that is taken up bystainless steel shelves and storage and the professional ranges where Bodigueland his staff of five whip up fare that rivals any Michelin two-star Frenchrestaurant.;   &quot;You have to be organized,&quot; said Bodiguel. When passengers seehis working space, they are amazed. The kitchens are at the end of each of twodining cars. A pass-through window allows servers to pick up the food withoutentering the kitchen -- there would be no room for them.;   The chef andkitchen staff produce five complete meals per trip for as many as 176passengers. When passengers board the train at 10 a.m. in Venice, Bodiguel hasjust loaded last-minute food items purchased early that morning in Venice,often at the nearby Rialto Market. (Bodiguel, however, says he prefers to dothe majority of his marketing in Paris, where he finds the quality ofingredients more predictable.);   High quality is his buzzword. &quot;I always tryto choose the most noble products,&quot; he said. &quot;Nothing is processed, everythingis fresh.&quot;;   From the moment the train departs Santa Lucia station, Bodiguelis working on lunch. In his six years on the Orient-Express, the chef has gotit down to a science. The menu changes every three months.;   Round-trippassengers get different menus on the return trip. A typical lunch was:delicate scallops in cream sauce, tender veal medallions, a spinach timbaleand a triangular wedge of crispy potato cake. Dessert was a light, apricotrice pudding.;   Pastries can't be prepared on board, said the chef: &quot;It isvery difficult to weigh flour and sugar with all of the jostling.&quot;;   (Therailroad cars date to the 1920s and the ride is not quite the equivalent ofup-to-date trains.);   &quot;Occasionally a whole container of sauce will spill ifthe train stops quickly,&quot; said Bodiguel. He shrugs. It's all part of the job,but it's a job he seems to love. &quot;I have no desire to work in a restaurant.Here at least I see the different countrysides while I cook!&quot;;   On the routefrom Venice to Paris, the scenery is inspiring. Winding through the Italianand Austrian Alps, the train makes brief stops. For the passenger in search offood, there is only time to grab a quick takeout bite in the Innsbruckstation. But who would want a snack when an elegant 4 p.m. tea and 8:30 p.m.dinner await?;   Tea is served in each passenger's compartment, a pleasantthough cramped experience if you're traveling double occupancy. Earl Grey orPrince of Wales tea comes with small pastries and cookies. Althoughcompartments are furnished with a banquette seat (that converts into bunk bedsat night), the narrow space makes it difficult to gather around the tea tray.;  The sink surrounded by shelves can be closed off with wood paneled doorsthat match the walls. All the detailing is faithful to the way the cars lookedin the 1920s, when the Orient-Express was the ultimate in rail travel.;  After the challenge of changing for dinner -- and everyone does dress fordinner -- it's time for a drink before sampling the chef's creations. The barcar offers a tuxedoed pianist at a baby grand and any drink, though at theseprices, it may be worth waiting for the wine with dinner. (Wine and drinkscost extra.);   Champagne is de rigueur. About 6,000 bottles are sold fromMarch to November. But a seat in the bar car offers more than drinks. It's achance to surreptitiously view fellow passengers who have been hiding in theircompartments or on a buying expedition at the gift shop.;   Dinner is anotherchance to meet fellow travelers. One of Bodiguel's menus included a delightfulgratin of fresh salmon with avocado and lobster sauce to start. Then came alamb fillet with blueberries in a light au jus. Small vegetables and sauteedpotatoes nestled next to the lamb. A platter of regional cheeses followed.Dessert was a rich chocolate cake topped with toasted coconut.;   Foie gras,that decadent French duck or goose liver, also makes a frequent appearance onBodiguel's menus -- almost a ton served per season.;   A small wine listoffers one to five selections that include bottles from Beaujolais, Bordeaux,Burgundy, the Loire and Rhone valleys, Piedmonte and Tuscany.;   In additionto the set menu for the evening, passengers also can choose from a small a lacarte menu (at an extra charge) that may include such dishes as smokedScottish salmon with avocado, beluga caviar with blinis, broiled baby lobster,red mullet and scampi with pureed olives, braised duckling with walnuts, freshfruit salad with sorbet or a marquise of pistachios and hazelnuts.;   Mealsare served with attention to detail by two or three servers in each of twodining cars. The Lalique Pullman dining car is decorated in blue with etchedglass panels and comfortable wingback chairs. The china is trimmed in blue andgold, the colors of the Orient-Express.;   Those on diet restrictions may callahead to arrange for suitable dishes.;   &quot;The chef also gives cooking classesin the hotels owned by Orient-Express Co. when he has time,&quot; said Chaumont.Hotels include the Cipriani in Venice, Villa San Michele in Florence, theHotel Splendido in Portofino, and the Lodge at Vail, Colorado.;   Due to thelimited space, no breads are baked on board the train, said Bodiguel. &quot;We pickthem up along the way. My favorite breads come from Zurich and I always try toarrange a pick-up there.&quot; Swiss-baked croissants, light and flaky, are servedto passengers in the morning along with rich, dark coffee and an assortment oftiny jars of preserves.;   By the time the train pulls into Paris' Gare Nordat 9 a.m. passengers are content, trying not to think of the calories chefBodiguel has so delightfully foisted upon them. As they disembark, they likelywill find the chef out on the platform, supervising a load, perhaps of freshlobster -- just a little something for lunch as the continental traincompletes its journey to Bologne, France, where passengers can transfer andcontinue to London.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The Orient-Express departs Venicefor Paris Wednesdays and Saturdays.
