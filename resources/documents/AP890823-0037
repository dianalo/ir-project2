Huey P. Newton, an eloquent speaker, co-founded the Panthers withBobby Seale in the offices of the old North Oakland NeighborhoodPoverty Program and served as its defense minister and chiefideologue.   At their peak, the Panthers were a national organization that ranfood programs and schools for ghetto youths, taught defense againstviolent attacks by drug dealers and police and served as acounterpoint to the pacifistic side of the civil rights movement.   Newton's numerous arrests and legal battles kept him in the newsuntil his death Tuesday. Other Panthers died young or went to jail,and some went on to careers with lower profiles.   Here are some of the figures who made the Black Panthers a voiceof hope for some, a cry of anguish for others and a source of fearfor many:   _Bobby Seale, 52, served as Panther chairman and is now agraduate student in political science at Temple University and worksas a community liaison in Philadelphia. Among the most enduringimages of the 1960s is that of Seale bound and gagged in the Chicagocourtroom where he was charged with conspiracy to incite violence atthe 1968 Democratic National Convention. His conviction for contemptof court was later overturned. He also was acquitted of killinganother Panther. He returned to Oakland in 1973 and came close tobeing elected mayor. Later he was purged from the party by Newton.   _Eldridge Cleaver, 53, who was Panther information minister andauthor of ``Soul on Ice,'' one of the seminal works of the BlackPower movement. Cleaver, who ran for president in 1968 on the Peaceand Freedom Party ticket, later fled the country following ashootout between Panthers and the police. He split with Newton inthe early 1970s and was purged from the party. He spent time inChina, Algeria and North Vietnam, and later said his experience withcommunist governments contributed to a profound politicalconversion. Returning to the United States, Cleaver became aborn-again Christian and Republican. He unsuccessfully sought theGOP nomination for the U.S. Senate in California in 1986. Cleaverwas placed on probation last year after separate convictions forburglary and cocaine possession. He recently told Ebony magazinethat he lectures to conservative groups and makes and sells ceramicobjects.   _Bobby Rush, 42, Panther deputy defense minister and head of thegroup's Chicago chapter, Rush left the Panthers after a 1969 policeraid on a Chicago apartment in which Fred Hampton, 20, and MarkClark, 21, were shot to death. After being jailed in 1971 on aweapons conviction, Rush said he realized that political power wouldcome only through the electoral system. He was elected to theChicago City Council in 1982 and continues to serve as an alderman.A father of five, Rush also runs his own financial consulting firm.   _Elaine Brown, Panther chairwoman from 1974 to 1977, when Newtonwas in Cuba. Under Brown, the Panthers concentrated on communityprojects in Oakland, Calif., including school breakfast programs,health clinics and legal aid to the poor. She ran unsuccessfully forOakland City Council in 1973 and 1975 and served as a delegate forformer California Gov. Jerry Brown at the Democratic NationalConvention in 1976. She now works for a Los Angeles attorney.   _Raymond ``Masai'' Hewitt, the Panther's education minister from1969 to 1971. Hewitt died of a heart attack in Los Angeles last yearat age 46; at the time, he was doing research on South Africa forthe Southern Christian Leadership Conference.   _Elmo ``Geronimo'' Pratt, 41, who headed the Panther's LosAngeles chapter. In 1972, he was convicted of murdering a SouthernCalifornia woman during a $30 robbery. He has maintained he was atBlack Panther headquarters in Oakland at the time. Pratt is servinga life sentence at San Quentin Prison.   _Johnny Spain, 40, joined the Panthers while at San Quentinserving time for a 1966 robbery-murder. He taught a course on thecriminal justice system at Stanford University last year and hopesto teach a similar course at the University of California atBerkeley next term. He also has been working as an electrician. Afederal appeals court ruled Tuesday that Spain is entitled to a newtrial in the 1971 killings of two prison guards, saying his trialdefense was hampered by the heavy shackles he was forced to wear inthe jury's view.</TEXT></DOC>
