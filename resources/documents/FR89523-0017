The revised part will establish policiesand procedures to implement the provisions of section 306(A) of the RuralElectrification Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 901 <T3>et seq.</T3>) (the ``RE Act''), section 633 of the Rural Development,Agriculture, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1988 (Pub. L. 100-202)(the ``Continuing Resolution''), and section 637 of the Rural Development,Agriculture, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1989 (Pub. L. 100-460)(the ``1989 Appropriations Act''). Section 306(A) of the RE Act deals with the prepayment of certain loansheld by the Federal Financing Bank (``FFB''), a wholly-owned governmentinstrumentality under the supervision of the Secretary of the Treasury,and guaranteed by REA. Section 633 of the Continuing Resolution provides that REA guaranteed FFBloans may be prepaid by borrowers pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) ofsection 306(A) of the REA Act, notwithstanding the provisins of subsections(c), (d), and (e) of section 306(A), provided that prepayments in excessof $2,500,000,000 shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary ofthe Treasury. Because $2 billion of prepayments were completed during FY 1988 under theprovisions of section 1401 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of1987 (``OBRA'') only an additional $500 million of prepayments may be consummatedwithout the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. The proposed regulations will implement the provisions of section 637 ofthe 1989 Appropriations Act which allocates $350 million of this $500 millionor prepayment activity to REA-financed electric utilities, and the remaining$150 million to REA-financed telephone utilities. The proposed regulations also set forth procedures for prioritizing andprocessing prepayment applications.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE:</T2> Written comments must be received by REA no later than June22, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES:</T2> Submit written comments to Mr. Laurence V.

This regulation will be issued in conformity with Executive Order 12291,Federal Regulations. It will not (1) have an annual effect on the economyof $100 million or more; or (2) result in a major increase in costs orprices for consumers, individuals, industries, Federal, state, or localgovernment agencies or geographic regions; or (3) result in significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment or productivity,and has been determined not to be ``major''. This action does not fall within the scope of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct. REA has concluded that promulgation of this proposed rule would notrepresent a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality ofthe human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969(42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. (1976)) and, therefore, does not require an environmentalimpact statement or an environmental assessment. This program is listedin the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance as 10.850, Rural ElectrificationLoans and Loan Guarantees and 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees.For the reasons set forth in the final rule related Notice to 7 CFR Part3015 Subpart V in 50 FR 47034, (November 14, 1985), this program is excludedfrom the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmentalconsultation with state and local officials. The reporting and/or recordkeeping requirements contained in this proposedrule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) underthe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>) The OMB approval number for these requirements is 0572-0088.The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto vary from 10 to 200 hours per response with an average of 27 hours perresponse including time for reviewing instructions, searching existingdata sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingand reviewing the collection of information, including suggestions forreducing this burden to Department of Agriculture, Clearance Officer, OIRM,Room 404-W, Washington, DC 20250 and to the Office of Management and Budget,Paperwork Reduction Project (OMBandplusmin; 0572-0088), Washington, DC 20503.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On January 14, 1987, REA published a final rule to add a new Part 1786to 7 CFR Chapter XVII. This rule set forth the REA policy and proceduresimplementing section 306(A) of the RE Act which permits an REA-financedelectric or telephone system to prepay an FFB loan (or any loan advanceon the loan (or advance), if:(a) The loan was outstanding on July 2, 1986;(b) Private capital, with the existing loan guarantee, is used to replacethe loan; and(c) The borrower certifies that any savings from such prepayment will bepassed on to its customers or used to improve the financial strength ofthe borrower in cases of financial hardship.Pursuant to subsection (c) of section 306(A) and the determination of theDepartment of the Treasury that par prepayments of FFB loans have an adverseeffect on the operation of the FFB, prepayments were limited during FY1987 to no more than $2.0175 billion.Furthermore, pursuant to subsection (d) of section 306(A), the January14, 1987 final rule established eligibility criteria to ensure that theauthorized prepayments during FY 1987 were directed to the cooperative-typeborrowers in the greatest need of the benefits associated with prepayment.The enactment of section 1401 of OBRA on December 22, 1987, permitted aborrower to prepay FFB pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of section 306(A),during FY 1988, notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (c), (d),and (e) of said andSection; 306(A).However, section 1401 of OBRA provided that prepayments in excess of $2,000,000,000during FY 1988 would be subject solely to the approval of the Secretaryof the Treasury. The Department of the Treasury determined that par prepaymentsin excess of $2,000,000,000 during FY 1988 would not be approved.On January 27, 1988, in order to implement the provisions of OBRA, REApublished an interim rule with requests for comments, which amended theJanuary 14, 1987 regulations by revising 7 CFR Part 1786, ``REA GuaranteedFederal Financing Bank Loans'' in its entirety. By February 25, 1988, borrowershad consummated $2,000,000,000 in prepayments, thus completing the prepaymentprogram under OBRA.The January 27, 1988 interim rule did not address prepayments under theprovisions of section 633 of the Continuing Resolution, some of the provisionsof which have been modified by section 637 of the 1989 Appropriations Act,nor did that interim rule address prepayments to be made after September30, 1988.As a result, in order to (1) implement the provisions of section 633 ofthe Continuing Resolution and the allocation provisions of section 637of the 1989 Appropriations Act; (2) eliminate certain provisions containedin the prior regulations which are no longer applicable; and (3) respondto comments received in conneciton with the January 27, 1988 interim rule,REA proposes to revise 7 CFR Part 1786. Because some of the revisions aresubstantive, the regulations are being published as a proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>In the January 27, 1988 interim rule, REA invited interested parties tofile comments on or before February 26, 1988. Although some comments werereceived after that date, all responses have been considered in preparingthis proposed rule.Seven different organizations or groups comments on the January 27, 1988interim rule. They are:1. The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association and the NationalRural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation (signed jointly),2. The National Rural Telecom Association and the United States TelephoneAssociation,<ITAG tagnum="15">3. The National Telephone Cooperative Association,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">4. Contel Service Corporation,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">5. Commonwealth Telephone Company,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">6. North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">7. United Telephone System.</ITAG>For the purposes of discussion, the comments of these organizations havebeen categorized.A number of the organizations pointed out that par prepayments during FY1988 were limited to $2 billion, and that the Interim Rule did not addressthe provisions of section 633 of the Continuing Resolution or prepaymentsto be made after September 30, 1988. Because the provisions of OBRA appliedto prepayments during FY 1988 and because the Treasury had determined thatpar prepayments in excess of $2 billion would not be approved during FY1988, REA did not intend that the January 27, 1988 regulations addresseither prepayments in excess of $2 billion, or prepayments made after theend of FY 1988. This Proposed Rule responds to these concerns by implementingthe provisions of section 633 of the Continuing Resolution and the allocationprovisions of section 637 of the 1989 Appropriations Act.A second major objection related to the fact that borrowers were unableto use internally generated funds to make the prepayment. Heretofore, REAhas required applicants to obtain the funds for the FFB prepayment froma private sector loan guaranteed by REA.REA has concluded that the requirement to borrow funds and refinance theFFB loan could be burdensome on borrowers which may be restricted fromobtaining private sector borrowings using an REA guarantee under the termsand conditions required by the previously issued interim regulations. Furthermore,REA recognizes nothing prevents the borrower from prepaying its new privatesector loan at any time it chooses. An applicant could borrow funds froma private sector lender to prepay FFB and then immediately prepay the newprivate sector loan with internally generated funds. In a situation wherea borrower wanted to use internally generated funds in connection witha prepayment, it could be unduly burdensome to require an applicant toexpend time, money, and effort to borrow the funds from a private sectorlender, with an REA guarantee, then prepay that loan.Additionally, the use of internally generated funds are likely to resultin faster processing of prepayment applications, reduced ``regulatory burden''on participating borrowers, and potentially more benefits being passedon to consumers by way of reduced transaction costs. Therefore, 7 CFR Part1786 will be amended to permit prepayments with internally generated funds.Also, many of these organizations objected to the provisions of the interimrule which required that, in order to qualify for an REA guarantee, theterms and conditions of the private loans must meet certain criteria. REAhas the authority and responsibility under the RE Act to set criteria forloans it guarantees, in order to minimize the potential for default andavoid increasing the risk and exposure of the Government under its guarantee.Therefore, provisions in the regulations relating to loan structure, amortization,and prepayment terms, etc. are justified.The terms of the existing promissory notes payable to FFB provide borrowerswith the choice of repaying short-term FFB advances without premium onthe short-term maturity dates of such advances or extending the maturitydate of such advances at interest rates reflecting then prevailing marketconditions. With such options available with respect to short-term FFBadvances, REA believes that it is appropriate to require prepayments toconsist of long-term FFB advances.In response to comments requesting additional flexibility in structuringthe private sector loans used to prepay the FFB loans, REA proposes tomodify certain provisions of the regulations where such modifications donot increase the loan guarantee risk to REA.Additionally, the regulations will be modified to eliminate the provisionsrelating to OBRA which no longer apply.The principal proposed modifications to 7 CFR Part 1786 are summarizedas follows:In accordance with the provisions of section 637 of the 1989 AppropriationsAct, this $500 million is being allocated, $350 million to REA-financedelectric utilities and $150 million to REA-financed telephone utilities(andSection; 1786.5(b)).Additionally, the Administrator is reserving $200 million of the electricprogram allocation until December 31, 1990, to allow financially distressedelectric borrowers time to develop a restructuring plan which may includea prepayment pursuant to section 306(A) of the RE Act (andSection; 1786.5(d)).Previously, REA identified eight electric borrowers as organizations whohave or may be unable to make timely payments of principal and intereston their outstanding REA loans and loan guarantees. Additionally, otherelectric borrowers who are in default or near default may be unable topay their outstanding loans and loan guarantees in accordance with theirterms.In connection with REA guarantees of loans made to some of these financiallydistressed electric borrowers, REA may, in order to make payments to lendersin accordance with its contracts of guarantee, be required to utilize thefinancial resources of the Rural Electrification and Telephone RevolvingFund (the ``Revolving Fund'') in accordance with the provisions of section302 of the RE Act. By reserving $200 million of this prepayment authorityto be used in connection with prepayment applications submitted by financiallydistressed electric borrowers, REA will be able to provide, should it berequired, additional Federal financial assistance to such borrowers underthe existing authorities granted the Administrator under the RE Act, whileat the same time ameliorating a portion of the adverse financial impacton the Revolving Fund caused by making payments under contracts of guarantee.Certain provisions of section 306(A) directing the Administrator to ensurethat the benefits associated with prepayments be directed to cooperativetype borrowers in the ``greatest need'' expired as of September 30, 1987.The provisions in OBRA for prioritizing prepayment applications expiredas of September 30, 1988 and the regulations are being revised to eliminatethese provisions. Neither section 633 of the Continuing Resolution, norsection 637 of the 1989 Appropriations Act contain any explicit provisionsfor prioritizing prepayment applications. Under the proposed revised regulations,prepayment applications from electric and telephone borrowers will be processedin the following order of priority:(1) Applications from financially distressed electric borrowers; and(2) Applications from other borrowers.For purposes of these regulations, a borrower is considered to be financiallydistressed, if it is an electric borrower determined by the Administratorto be in default or near default or is participating in a work out or debtrestructuring plan with REA (andSection; 1786.3(a)).Except for applications from financially distressed borrowers, all prepaymentapplications from qualified electric and telephone borrowers must be receivedby REA during a specified application period. This will ensure that allsuch electric and telephone borrowers have an equal opportunity to applyfor a prepayment under these revised regulations. Old prepayment applications,applications submitted under the provisions of prior versions of 7 CFRPart 1786, applications received prior to the commencement of the applicationperiod, and applications received after the expiration of the applicationperiod will be returned to the borrower without action by REA. The actualtime and date an application is received by REA during the applicationperiod and the proposed settlement date of the prepayment will not be consideredin determining the priority of the prepayment applications or their orderof processing (andSection; 1786.6(a)).REA believes that the amount of prepayment applications received from financiallydistressed electric borrowers and from other electric and telephone borrowerswill exceed the $500 million available for prepayment. In the event thatduring the application period REA does not receive prepayment applicationstotaling $150 million from electric borrowers other than financially distressedborrowers or $150 million from telephone borrowers REA intends to publisha notice establishing a new application period (andSection; 1786.6(a)(2)).Additionally, should a portion of the $200 million currently being reservedfor financially distressed borrowers remain available after December 31,1990, REA will evaluate whether further financially distressed borrowersmay need assistance, and if not, REA will announce the establishment ofa new application period (andSection; 1786.5(d) and andSection; 1786.6(a)).Should the amount of prepayment applications submitted during the applicationperiod by telephone or electric borrowers exceed the amount of prepaymentauthority available to such borrowers under their respective programs,such applications shall be prorated on a percentage basis so that all suchqualifying borrowers will be able to participate in this prepayment program.In no event shall funds allocated to electric program borrowers and totelephone program borrowers be reallocated to the other program (andSection;1786.6(b)).The application procedure is being modified to reduce the financial andadministrative burden in connection with filing the initial prepaymentapplication (andSection; 1786.7).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1786</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Electric utilities, Telephone utilities,Guaranteed loan program_Energy, Guaranteed loan program_Telephony.In view of the above, REA proposes to amend 7 CFR Chapter XVII by revisingPart 1786 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 1786_PREPAYMENT OF REA GUARANTEED FEDERAL FINANCING BANK LOANS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1786.1 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1786.2 Policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1786.3 Definitions and rules of construction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1786.4 Qualifications.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1786.5 Prepayment authority, program allocations, categories of prepaymentapplications, and financially distressed borrowers' reserve.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1786.6 Processing procedure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1786.7 Application procedure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1786.8 Settlement procedure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1786.9 Forms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1786.10 Access to records of lenders, servicers, and trustees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1786.11 Loss, theft, destruction, mutilation, or defacement of REAguarantee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1786.12 Other prepayments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1786.13 Application of regulation to previous prepayments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1786.14 Judicial review.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 7 U.S.C. 901-950b; Title I, Subtitle B, Pub.
