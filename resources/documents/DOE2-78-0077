Recently FBW(Fly By Wire) which controls the movements of an aircraft only by electricsignals has been introduced, and it has helped to reduce the weight andthe bulk of an aircraft and also to improve the maneuverability. Thespecial feature of an aircraft steering apparatus is that it is requiredof high reliability, so multiplexing and mutual checking techniques areplentifully applied. In the future, the pressure of a hydraulic actuatoris likely to be elevated, and an electric actuator will come to the fore.Various improvements that Active Control Technology (ACT) made possibleare also introduced in this report.
