Dragged down by sharp declines in key takeover issues, the DowJones average of 30 industrials fell 24.35 points on Thursday,closing at 2,140.83.   The new wave of multibillion-dollar buyouts relies heavily ondebt, and many observers are concerned that the financing of thesedeals ultimately may prove too fragile.   ``This is not business as usual,'' said Robert Brusca, chiefeconomist at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. of the highlevel of debt mandated in these transactions. ``When you take ablue-chip company and turn it into a buffalo-chip company, it's nota good situation.''   Reflecting skepticism over Kohlberg Kravis Robert andamp; Co.'s abilityto fund its $20.3 billion tender offer for RJR Nabisco Inc.,Nabisco's stock fell $2.75 share to $82.   Other takeover issues also lost substantial ground, includingKraft Inc., which fell $3 to $94.50; West Point-Pepperell Inc.plunged $3.37{ to $44.50, and Pillsbury Co. slipped $2.12{ to$58.87{. Also down were so-called ``whisper'' stocks, which hadrisen on spillover speculation.   ``There's too much debt supporting the nation's corporations,that's what this is telling us,'' said Philip Puccio, a senior vicepresident at Dillon Read andamp; Co.   Amplifying worries over the size of the recent deals were twodevelopments. In the corporate bond market, where the billionsneeded to finance the deals are raised, a $1.15 billion junk bondsale for Campeau Corp.'s takeover of Federated Department Stores hita major snag.   Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has urgedbanks to be cautious about lending money for multibillion-dollartakeovers and buyouts. Greenspan's warning came in a letter to theSenate Banking Committee on Wednesday.   ``Institutions have participated in so much of this debtfinancing that (the financial community) is starting to worry,''said Puccio. ``They're afraid that if this thing does keep buildingthe way it is and corporate America becomes a house of cards, it cancollapse the way the stock market did.''   Transactions that are dependent upon a high level of debt arelosing much of their allure. For example, Wall Street Journal reportthat U.S. Shoe Corp. is considering a leveraged buyout was said tobe a factor in sending the company's stock tumbling $1.37{ to $24.25.   Before the recent rash of deals, analysts agree, such a reportwould have driven the company's stock higher.   In the junk bond market, underwriter First Boston Corp. said thatwhile it had not officially withdrawn its offering for the Federateddeal, it was engaged in discussions to restructure the transaction.   Proceeds from the sale of these high-risk bonds were destined topay off bridge loans used to cover the short-term costs of theCampeau takeover announced last spring. A delay could spell troublefor the banks and investment houses that provided that financing.   ``If this causes some players to sit on the sidelines becausethey committed too much capital, then maybe they'll think twice nexttime,'' Brusca said.   Because the recent deals all involve huge amounts of borrowedmoney, they could be devastated by higher interest rates or theinability of a company to sell off assets to cover the debt. Someobservers also fear there aren't enough investors interested inpurchasing billions of new junk bonds.   But Michael Dahood, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp;Co., contends there is a hefty appetite for larger deals. ``I don'tthink deals that have a sound economic basis should have anydifficulty getting funded,'' he said.   The problem, however, is broader than one firm and onetransaction.   ``I'm concerned about the fact that at any point in time thereare a lot of firms that are highly leveraged,'' said Gregg Jarrell,former Securities and Exchange Commission economist and now aprofessor at the University of Rochester.   ``No one can really know the full extent of what could happen ifthe economy turned down,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
