<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-39-0406 </DOCNO><TEXT>A brief summary is given of some new developments in TLD which have achieveda relatively energy independent beta response, e.g. the Vinten extremitydosemeter, very thin LiF-PTFE discs, LiF-PTFE discs with a 5 to 10% loadingof carbon impurity and TLD readers using laser heating. A new TLD material,LiF: Mg, Cu, P which has an energy independent response over a widerrange of photon energies and very high sensitivity is also described.Finally recent studies of the re-assessment of absorbed dose by phototransferredthermoluminescence providing verification of the primary assessed dosein TLD materials are briefly discussed.
