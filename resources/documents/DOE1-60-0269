<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-60-0269 </DOCNO><TEXT>The question of complete in-cavity oxidation of combustible gases producedby core-concrete interactions following vessel breach has been investigated.Because a variety of phenomena, such as steam inerting and oxygen transportby natural convection, may influence the degree of in-cavity oxidationthat takes place, assuming a complete oxidation may be overly optimistic.The Hydrogen Event: Containment Transient Response (HECTR) analyses ofan ice-condenser containment during an S2HF drain-closed accident showthat the in-cavity oxidation process is limited by the rate at whichoxygen is transported into the reactor cavity region. Accumulation andsubsequent combustion of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the upper andlower compartments generate a peak pressu8re at 384 kPa (56 psig) at7.4 hours that an earlier Industry Degraded Core Rulemaking (IDCOR) analysisdid not predict.</TEXT></DOC>
