(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   OK, here's the challenge: Screw alid onto a glass jar.   If that sounds simple, you'll never win the eighth annual RubeGoldberg competition at Purdue University, which aims to turn theeasiest tasks into amazingly complicated ones.   In the spirit of Rube Goldberg, the cartoonist who specializedin drawing complicated machines that performed mundane tasks, thisyear's teams must use at least 25 steps to affix a two-piece lidonto a pint-sized Ball canning jar.   The lid has to be tight enough so that the jar can be turnedupside down without spilling. The task must be accomplished in fiveminutes or less.   Winners of the Feb. 17 campus contest will compete againstwinners from other colleges and universities on March 17 at Purdue.David Oliver, student chairman of the competition, said he expectedfour to six teams at each level.   Past challenges have included sharpening a pencil and preparingan egg for frying.   ``It's a unique competition in that people, mainly technologyand engineering students, have taken principles of science andengineering and turned them inside out, finding complex ways to dosimple tasks,'' Oliver said.</TEXT><DATELINE>SENECA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man appeared in a village courtMonday with a rooster tucked under his arm and told the judge thebird was the only legal counsel he could afford.   The judge cried fowl.   David Ashley was charged last month with raising poultry withouta permit, but his case was postponed until he could got a lawyer.   When Ashley appeared in court with the rooster, village JusticeGordon Tetor told him to get rid of the bird.   ``It was the only legal counsel I could afford,'' Ashley toldthe judge.   ``I don't think he could speak,'' Tetor said.   ``Sure they can, they speak to me all the time,'' Ashley said.   After removing the chicken, Ashley told the judge he couldn'tafford a lawyer. He also told Tetor he would represent himself butwasn't ready to go trial. Tetor adjourned the case until March 5.   Ashley and his wife, Lynda, have about 20 chickens at their homethat they say are pets for their two children. Mrs. Ashley spent 10days in jail in October after refusing to seek a permit or get ridof the chickens.   The Ashleys applied for a permit in November but the villageboard turned them down and gave them 10 days to remove thechickens. David Ashley was charged after the couple failed toremove the birds.</TEXT></DOC>
