The London-based human rights group chastised Brazilianauthorities for not enforcing laws to stem the violence and said ithas evidence public servants were themselves involved in someincidents.   Land reform is a deeply divisive issue in Brazil, where 4percent of the population of 141 million own almost half the arableland.   Amnesty said the report that although it takes no position onland issues, it was ``alarmed at systematic and widespread failureto enforce the rule of law which has led to serious human rightsviolations in Brazil.''   The report accuses authorities of allowing abuses to govirtually unpunished and speaks of ``overwhelming evidence that theintimidation and violence of landowners and land speculators is notonly sanctioned, but frequently assisted by state authorities.''   In an example of official indifference, the report said, apolice chief at Goianesiua police station in Para state allegedlytold one woman whose husband and son were shot dead in October 1987that he could not register the crime because he had no pen andpaper.   In addition to the deaths of more than 1,000 people in landdisputes since 1980, hundreds more were tortured or ill-treated andcountless others were forced off their land, the group said.   It said it sent its report to Brazilian authorities in April anddiscussed its concerns with senior federal government officials inthe capital city of Brasilia in June.   The officials acknowleged state action had been inadequate ``butdid not accept that this called for direct federal intervention,''Amnesty said.   The group said evidence suggested most of the killings werecarried out by gunmen hired by landowners to terrorize and evictthose considered a threat to their interests. Most victims werepeasants, native Indians, priests, nuns, church workers, lawyersand trade unionists, it said.   The report quotes the Brazilian Bar Association as sayingkillings can allegedly be contracted through a ``death syndicate''with offices in Imperatriz in Maranhao state. It says police arereported to have been recruited by such syndicates.   ``Local police treat these killings so lightly that they oftendo not bother to register the crimes,'' the report says.   ``Even when crimes are recorded, police have failed to collectevidence and ignored routine procedures such as visiting the sceneof the crime and interviewing suspects,'' it says.   Convictions or punishments were imposed only in two land-relatedkillings, the report says.   It says police routinely carry out arbitrary arrests ofpeasants, mistreat and sometimes torture them and evict them fromtheir land illegally, apparently to discourage them from pursuingpolitical activities.   It says hired gunmen sometimes accompany police.   In February 1987, military police are reported to have illegallyrounded up 50 peasants, including children, in the vicinity of SaoGeraldo do Araguaia, south Para, and marched them at gunpoint to alandowner's ranch house, Amnesty said.   ``They are alleged to have raped two women, savagely beaten thepeasants with rifle butts and sticks, compelled some to eatexcrement, thorns and lighted cigarettes and forced bottles downthe throats of others,'' it said. ``None of the peasants returnedto their land afterward.''   Peasants arrested after gunmen or landowners were killed wereheld incommunicado without judicial order and mistreated or eventortured to obtain confessions or statements that would incriminateothers, Amnesty said.</TEXT></DOC>
