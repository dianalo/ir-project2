Unpublished corporate communications were important in developingTLVs for 104 substances; for 15 of these, the TLV documentation was basedsolely on such information. Efforts to obtain written copies of thisunpublished material were mostly unsuccessful. Case studies on the TLVCommittee's handling of lead and seven carcinogens illustrate variousaspects of corporate influence and interaction with the committee. Corporaterepresentatives listed officially as consultants since 1970 were givenprimary responsibility for developing TLVs on proprietary chemicals ofthe companies that employed them (Dow, DuPont). It is concluded thatan ongoing international effort is needed to develop scientifically basedguidelines to replace the TLVs in a climate of openness and without manipulationby vested interests.</TEXT></DOC>
