(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Construction of part of a shopping centeradjacent to Manassas National Battlefield Park will be haltedindefinitely to prevent damage to federally protected wetlands,U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials said today.   ``It's a dream come true,'' said Betty Rankin, president of theSave the Battlefield Coalition, which has been fighting theproposed William Center complex.   ``The Army Corps of Engineers has accomplished, at leasttemporarily, what developers and the county refused to do. We allfeel relieved,'' she said.   The cease-and-desist order issued Wednesday applies to workbeing done at Young's Branch, a creek running through the Civil Warbattlefield site, and on adjacent wetlands. DevelopersHazel@Peterson Cos. have started construction of one of two roadsthat would cross the creek.   The stop-work order, which extends indefinitely, was issuedbecause the developers violated a corps provision requiring thatthe Army be notified when a project could affect a historicproperty, said corps spokesman Bill Brown.   ``Our concern is with the two roads crossing the creek,'' Brownsaid. ``That work could have an impact on the park.''   John T. (Til) Hazel, president of the development group, has 10days from receipt of the letter to explain why the Army wasn'tnotified about the road, Brown said.   The stop-work order could entirely block construction of theproject or force the developer to alter its design if aninvestigation determines that the park would be adversely affected,Brown added.   Preservationists claim construction of the massive project,which includes a 1.2-million-square-foot shopping mall, 1.7 millionsquare feet of office space and 560 homes, would destroy 50 acresof wetlands and ruin beaver dams and rare plants spread throughoutthe 542-acre tract.   Historians feel the project will destroy forever the sanctity ofthe still-rustic setting of two crucial Civil War battles.   Robert Kelly, a spokesman for Hazel@Peterson, told TheWashington Post that his firm would do everything in its power tocomply with the Army's requests.   The work-stoppage order came as proposals to block the projectwere gaining momentum in Congress.   On Tuesday, a House Interior and Insular Affairs panel held ahearing on several congressional proposals to take control of thedevelopment tract and add it to the 4,600-acre park.   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., on Wednesday offered legislation thatwould deprive Hazel@Peterson of direct access to the site fromInterstate 66. The measure failed in the appropriationssubcommittee, but Warner said he would introduce it before the fullAppropriations Committee.</TEXT></DOC>
