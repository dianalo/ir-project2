Ruder said Friday he was concerned about the resurgence ofprogram stock trading, which could herald a return of marketconditions similar to those preceding the 1987 crash.   One day after announcing his resignation, Ruder also said marketchanges since the Oct. 19, 1987 crash _ when the Dow Jonesindustrial average plunged 508 points _ could help deter but wouldnot necessarily prevent another collapse.   Ruder said he did not believe the stock market was overvaluednow. The Dow industrials closed above 2,500 Friday for the firsttime since the crash.   But Ruder said there would be reason to worry if the Dow hit3,000, partly because of the increasing use of computerized programtrading strategies that some critics have blamed for increasingstock market volatility during the time of the crash.   ``What frankly that I have some concern about is that we havehad a return to the markets of program activity and portfoliotrading, particularly by broker-dealer firms acting asprincipals,'' Ruder told the Women's Economic Round Table.   ``The possibility is we may see a 300- to 600-point large pricerise,'' Ruder said. ``If that would happen then I would beconcerned about a drop to follow that.''   The New York Stock Exchange defines program trading asstrategies involving the purchase or sale of a group of 15 or morestocks. Most major firms limited their program trading activityshortly after the 1987 crash amid escalating public criticism ofthe practice, although many recently have increased such operations.   However, the average daily NYSE volume accounted for by programtrading dipped to 7.6 percent in April after two months of advances.   Ruder said post-crash defensive measures included bettercommunication among brokerages and exchanges, automation that hasimproved market efficiency and the installation of ``circuitbreaker'' rules at that mandate temporary stock trading halts inthe event of huge price drops.   ``It's as though we have resurfaced all our highways now and youcan drive 150 miles an hour on them. And the question is what willhappen if everybody drives 150 miles an hour,'' he said.   Ruder announced Thursday he was resigning to resume teaching atNorthwestern University's law school, probably in the fall. He tookover the SEC, which regulates the nation's securities markets, inAugust 1987 and has presided over a turbulent period including thecrash and the government's unprecedented fraud prosecution of theinvestment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.   Ruder denied he was leaving because of any policy disagreementswith the Bush administration and said the move was a ``personaldecision that I could not commit to President Bush'' for four yearsas chairman.   ``I believe that it is important that the president have someoneto run the commission who is willing to spend a reasonably longperiod of time in the position,'' he told reporters. ``When I askedmyself would I be willing to stay through the presidency ofPresident Bush my answer was `no.'''   In other comments, Ruder praised the growth in the market forjunk bonds, high-interest rate securities used to finance dozens ofmergers and corporate expansions.   ``I think the development of an active market in less thaninvestment grade debt _ junk bonds _ has been a very positivephenomenon for our country,'' he said. ``I think that market isimportant in the continued financing of our companies and I thinkit's beneficial.''   Junk bond financing used in corporate takeovers has beencriticized as rendering the target companies as vulnerable tofailure during a recession, due to their debt burdens.   Ruder also defended the SEC's civil suit and settlement ofwide-ranging fraud violations against Drexel.   ``The actvities we outlined in the Drexel complaint involveinjuries to the public by a major professional brokerage firm,'' hesaid. ``And I believe it to be part of my job to preventprofessionals in our society from taking advantage of the public.''</TEXT></DOC>
