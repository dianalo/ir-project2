(product development).andO;Topic:     Network Management SoftwareProduct DevelopmentEnhancements.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Karyl ScottandM;Farallon Computing Inc. this fall plans to announce enhancements to its suiteof Macintosh network-management tools that more tightly integrate theutilities, enabling customers to manage their growing and increasinglycomplex Mac networks, company President Reese Jones said last week.andM;Farallon's statement of direction comes in response to user demand for moreand better network-management tools for the Macintosh environment.andP;  ''Networkmanagement is one of the biggest user demands today,'' said Thomas Rielly,director of marketing for Farallon, of Berkeley, Calif.andP;  ''Without theability to determine how your network is performing, where bridges should beplaced and where problems are, it's a crapshoot.''andM;The company will enhance its network-monitoring, administration and analysistools that will more closely link such other tools as StarCommand, thataddress physical-connectivity issues, with such products as CheckNet, thatfocus on protocol-related issues.andM;Farallon makes the PhoneNet network cabling system, which runs on theAppleTalk network operating system.andP;  The firm's host ofnetwork-management-related applications includes Traffic Watch, PhoneNet,CheckNet, Timbuktu, StarCommand and Traffic Watch.andM;Traffic Watch displays network-traffic data in real time, while CheckNetallows users and managers to access the name, address and type of device onthe network, and to search for devices across multiple network bridges andzones, according to Rielly.andM;The Timbuktu remote screen-sharing application provides on-line training andnetwork support.andP;  The StarCommand software, which is bundled with Farallon'sStarController intelligent network hub, allows users and managers to turnports on and off, check traffic loads and test wire quality, he explained.andM;A single package offering a wide range of network options will be welcomed atmany Mac installations.andP;  ''Network management in the Mac arena isn't where itshould be,'' said Rob Picchione, principal communications specialist at CodexCorp., a Motorola Corp. subsidiary based in Canton, Mass., that has 2,200networked Macs.andM;''At this point, we have to use several different products from variousvendors to piece together a network-management system.andP;  Anyone used torunning VAX or SNA [Systems Network Architecture] networks would be aghast atwhat we have to work with,'' he said, although he conceded that useful Macnetwork-management tools are starting to arrive on the market.andM;Codex combines Farallon's PhoneNet and StarControllers with Apple ComputerInc.'s AppleTalk as its basic departmental network system in its three mainlocations in Massachusetts.andP;  The firm is also using Traffic Watch to pinpointproblems on networks or network segments.andM;While Arthur Young andamp; Co. waits for better Mac network-management solutions,the New York financial-services firm is using Farallon's Traffic Watch tokeep tabs on its 155 Macs, 90 of which are networked on AppleTalk andPhoneNet networks.andM;''We're not writing any custom network-management applications.andP;  We're usingoff-the-shelf software such as Traffic Watch and Timbuktu,'' said RobbKinnin, microcomputer supervisor.andP;  ''Recently, users were complaining thatthe network was slower than usual.andP;  I ran Traffic Watch for a week.andP;  Theprogram allowed us to pinpoint congestion and work around it.''andM;However, both companies have stopped using Farallon's CheckNet in favor ofApple's Inter -- Poll Network Administrator utility, which provides networkmapping, troubleshooting, selective searches for active devices, network-linkintegrity tests and version reporting for workstation system software.andM;Farallon can be reached in Berkeley, Calif., at (415) 841-5770.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
