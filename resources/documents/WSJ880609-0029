Michael Dukakis' apparent hold on more than enough delegates to win.    The Rev. Jackson emphatically said &quot;of course not&quot; when asked at a news conference if he would concede to Mr. Dukakis. Instead, Mr. Jackson said he will work in states and congressional districts that he won to persuade delegates pledged to Gov. Dukakis to change their minds and back him.    During the news conference, Mr. Jackson said many times that he has earned &quot;consideration&quot; for the vice presidential slot on the Democratic ticket. And he refused to back away from a Cable News Network report that he has said he wants the vice presidency. &quot;The vice presidency is not quite the top, but it's a long ways from where I started,&quot; he said.    Mr. Jackson said he intends before the Democratic convention to meet with Gov. Dukakis and also to deliver several major policy addresses &quot;to define further the new direction for our party and our nation.&quot; He added that he will continue his push for party rule changes so that candidates' delegate counts would more directly reflect their percentage of popular votes. He said his percentage of the delegates is far below his percentage of the vote in several states. </TEXT></DOC>
