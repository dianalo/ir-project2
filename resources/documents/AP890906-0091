Hundreds of thousands of disenfranchised blacks staged a generalstrike capping nationwide protests of the parliamentary election.   Factories, businesses, schools and transportation services closeddown in major cities, where more than 90 percent of black workersand most students stayed home.   Police said they used tear gas, rubber bullets and birdshot tohalt protests at election booths and to stop crowds from throwingstones and erecting barricades in black, Indian and mixed-racetownships. At least 15 people were arrested, including journalists.   In a mixed-race suburb east of Johannesburg, police escortedtelevision crews away from a demonstration before using tear gas andwhips to disperse protesters. Witnesses said many demonstrators werechildren. Police arrested two men.   Police also arrested 13 anti-election protesters at a votingstation in Durban.   The Congress of South African Trade Unions said more than 1million blacks participated in Tuesday's demonstrations, rallies andstrikes at which police arrested 500 people.   Train service into Cape Town was delayed today by an earlymorning explosion on the track, the South African Transport Servicesaid. No injuries were reported.   Acting President F.W. de Klerk smiled, shook hands and enjoyed achampagne breakfast at his Pretoria-area polling booth. Officialssay the vote is the most crucial since the governing National Partycame to power on promises of strict race segregation in 1948.   De Klerk's Nationalists are expected to lose up to 30 of their123 parliamentary seats, mostly to the Conservative Party whichfavors strict race discrimination.   Nevertheless, the Nationalists are expected to retain a majorityin Parliament's dominant white chamber after promoting a plan tobegin sharing some power with the country's 28 million blacks.   The government said 3,170,667 whites were eligible to vote.Turnout was reported sluggish because of freezing temperatures andbiting winds early today, but lines formed at polling places afternoon, government radio said.   Whites voted for members of the white House of Assembly. Morethan 665,000 Indians and 1.7 million people of mixed race wereeligible to vote for separate Parliament chambers with little power.Blacks have no vote.   The polls opened at 7 a.m. and were to close at 9 p.m. Finalelection results are not expected until Thursday.   Police armed with handguns were stationed at most polling booths.Major black townships around Durban, Cape Town, Pretoria,Johannesburg and eastern Cape cities were quiet.   Virtually no taxi-vans were operating, and buses and trains tothe cities were 70 percent to 100 percent empty.   Black worker absenteeism ranged from 72 percent in the industrialheartland around Johannesburg to virtually 100 percent in theeastern Cape cities of Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage, said the LaborMonitoring Group at the University of the Witwatersrand.   ``The stayaway is very comprehensive, with most companiesreporting absenteeism of over 70 percent,'' said Brian Angus,director of the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation, whosemembers employ 350,000 mostly black workers.   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said, ``I'm not paying a greatdeal of attention'' to the elections. ``I'm more interested in howmany people stay away. I would hope that white South Africans wouldbe aware that the bulk of the people in this country are not votingand they should join us in getting rid of the system.''   State television said low voter turnout would increase thechances of a hung Parliament, in which no party would have amajority. In that case, a coalition government would have to beformed or a new election called.   For the first time since 1953, political analysts predict theNationalists could receive less than half the white vote. But aslong as they poll more than 40 percent and retain 84 of their 123seats, they will remain the governing party.   The right-wing Conservative Party has 22 of the white chamber's166 elected seats, the anti-apartheid Democrats have 20 and one seatin the last Parliament was held by a now-defunct moderate party.   The government-run Radio South Africa said the elections ``have avital bearing on how South Africa enters the future and how thiscountry will look in succeeding decades.''   The Nationalistts have proposed negotiating a new constitutiongiving blacks a share of national power within five years, but alsoprotecting against a loss of white power.   The Conservatives say negotiating with blacks inevitably willlead to black majority rule.</TEXT></DOC>
