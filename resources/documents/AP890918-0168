At 6 p.m. EDT Monday, a U.S. Air Force reconnaissance aircraftand satellite pictures located the center of the tropical storm near16.5 north latitude and 56.5 west longitude, or about 300 miles eastof the Leeward Islands, a group of islands in the Lesser Antilles ofthe West Indies.   The governments of Barbados, St. Vincent and St. Lucia issuedwarnings for Iris, the ninth named storm of this Atlantic hurricaneseason.   Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables saidIris was moving toward the north-northwest at about 18 mph.   Swirling weather patterns left behind by Hugo made furtherstrengthening unlikely through Tuesday evening, said hurricanespecialist Gil Clark. Iris was expected to hold its course at aslightly slower pace during that time.   Tropical depressions become tropical storms when their topsustained winds reach 39 mph. Iris became a storm Sunday.</TEXT></DOC>
