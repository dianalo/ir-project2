This amendment is limited to makingmore protective 212 Permissible Exposure Limits (PEL) listed in these threeTables; setting new PEL's for 164 substances not currently regulated byOSHA; and maintaining other PELs unchanged. Changes include revision ofthe PEL; inclusion of Short Term Exposure Limits (STEL) to complement 8hour time weighted average (TWA) limits; establishment of skin designation;and addition of ceiling limits as appropriate.All of the revised PELs are included in a single new Table Z-1-A whichalso includes the existing OSHA PELs under the Transitional Limits Columns.This regulation permits the use of any compliance methodology, until Dec.31, 1992, to achieve the revised PEL. However, during this time periodthe established OSHA hierarchy of controls with preference for engineeringcontrols will be applied to achieve the level of the transitional PELs.Tables Z-2 and Z-3 are temporarily maintained since they contain limitswhich cannot conveniently be included in the format used in Table Z-1-A.OSHA has reviewed health, risk and feasibility evidence for all 428 substancesfor which changes to the PEL were considered. In each instance where arevised or new PEL is adopted, OSHA has determined that the new limitssubstantially reduce a significant risk of material health impairment amongAmerican workers, and that the new limits are technologically and economicallyfeasible.The revised standards will provide additional occupational health protectionto 4.5 million workers at an annual cost of approximately $150 per employeeprotected.

Background Soon after adoption of the OSH Act in 1970, the Occupational Safety andHealth Administration (OSHA) promulgated Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs)for many substances pursuant to the authority granted by section 6(a) whichallowed the Agency to promulgate existing Federal Standards or nationalconsensus standards as enforceable OSHA standards. Most of the PELs containedin the Z-Tables of 29 CFR 1910.1000 were adopted from the Walsh-HealeyPublic Contracts Act as existing Federal Standards. These in turn had beenadopted from the 1968 Threshold Limit Values of the American Conferenceof Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). Some consensus standardsfrom the American Standards Association were also adopted at that time,following the 6(a) procedures. Industrial experience, new developments in technology, and scientific dataclearly indicate that in many instances these adopted limits are not sufficientlyprotective of worker health. In addition, there are no PELs for many toxicmaterials commonly used in the workplace. This has been demonstrated bythe reduction in allowable exposure limits recommended by many technical,professional, industrial, and government organizations, both inside andoutside the United States. In addition, these organizations have identifiedmany other substances for which allowable exposure limits are needed tosupplement the existing Z-Tables. Many large industrial organizations havefelt obligated to supplement the existing OSHA PELs with their own internalcorporate guidelines. OSHA has focused its past priorities on the development of detailed andbroad regulations for some high priority substances. This has resultedin major reductions in deleterious health effects for those 24 substancesfor which regulations have been adopted. However, OSHA has not been ableto consider the need for regulating the thousands of substances commonlyfound in the workplace, or to review the scientific information to determineif different limits are required for the more than 400 substances now regulatedunder the provisions of the Z-Tables. OSHA determined that it was necessary to modify this approach through theuse of generic rulemaking, which would simultaneously cover many substances.The Hazard Communication Standard is an example of a regulation using suchan approach. At this time, OSHA is also in the process of considering theneed for development of generic standards to cover: Respiratory protection;medical surveillance; and exposure monitoring. Without a generic approachOSHA would not be able to provide the level of health protection requiredfor many work situations. OSHA concludes that it is of first priority to modify existing PELs, andto establish PELs for substances for which no exposure limits exist. Theexisting health literature and expert judgment indicates that such actionsare required to protect against: Kidney and liver diseases; respiratorydiseases; nerve disorders; carcinogenicity; irritation to various bodyorgans; and many other material impairments to health. Millions of employeesare potentially exposed to substances of concern, and adoption of sucha regulation would represent one of the most significant steps to ensurethe adequacy of health protection for workers. This regulation will achievethese objectives. B. Proposal On June 7, 1988, OSHA proposed to amend and expand the PELs for substancescovered in the 29 CFR 1910.1000 Z-Tables and add new PELs to address thisdeficiency. To facilitate this major change for a large number of substances,OSHA initially considered available, generally accepted guidelines or recommendationsas its starting point for establishing new PELs. Initially, this involveda review of 14 data bases which might serve this purpose. After analysesof the characteristics of each data base, compared to OSHA requirements,it was decided that OSHA would utilize the already published and widelyaccepted 1987-88 Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) published by the AmericanConference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) and the RecommendedExposure Limits (RELs) developed by the National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health (NIOSH) as the starting point for its analysis. OSHAused both the TLVs and RELs as a starting point for making its own independentjudgment regarding selection of the proper PEL. The TLV listing was usedto define the bounds of substances included in this rulemaking. The Proposal considered new PELs for 428 substances. OSHA reviewed thehealth evidence for each individual substance and preliminarily determinedthat available evidence would form a reasonable basis for proposing a newlimit. It also preliminarily concluded that the new limits were technicallyand economically feasible. This proposed regulation was intended to reducediseases (resulting from workplace exposure to chemicals) such as liverand kidney impairments; neuropathy; cardiovascular effects; respiratoryeffects; lung function deterioration; narcosis; biochemical and metabolicchanges; and other material impairment of health. During the Public Hearing,extensive additional information was developed to permit OSHA to make afinal determination of the health effects and risk associated with eachsubstance under consideration for adoption of a new PEL. OSHA also prepared a Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis (PRIA) whichestimated average annual costs per establishment to achieve compliance,and total costs by industry sector. Preliminarily, OSHA determined thatcompliance with the proposed PELs would be technologically and economicallyfeasible. As part of this analysis OSHA also identified health relatedbenefits which would be achieved. These benefits included the reductionof occupational illness cases, lost workdays and fatalities.C. Final RegulationOn the basis of all the information in the record, including the data uponwhich OSHA based its Proposal, public submissions, additional health andfeasibility data (some of which became available during this rulemakingprocess), additional analyses of all data, and consideration of the statutoryrequirements defined by the OSH Act, a revised set of PELs is issued inthis regulation.Through this regulation, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA) is amending its existing Air Contaminants standards, andSection; 1910.1000including Tables Z-1, Z-2 and Z-3. This amendment is limited to changingmany of the Permissible Exposure Limits (PEL) listed in these three Tableswhile maintaining other PELs unchanged. All PELs are listed in a new TableZ-1-A which replaces Table Z-1.This amendment reduces the PEL for 212 substances now listed in the Z-Tables,and sets new PELs for 164 substances currently not regulated by OSHA. Changesinclude revision of the PEL; inclusion of Short Term Exposure Limits (STEL)to complement 8 hour time weighted average (TWA) limits; and, as appropriate,establishment of a skin designation and/or ceiling limits.All of the revised PELs are included in a single new Table Z-1-A, whichalso includes the existing PELs enforced by OSHA. This side-by-side formatis provided as a user convenience, and as a reference source since thisregulation permits the use of any compliance procedures for the first 4years following publication of the regulation. However, during this timeperiod the established OSHA hierarchy of controls with preference for engineeringcontrols will continue to be applied to achieve the level of the existingPELs.Tables Z-2 and Z-3 are temporarily maintained since they cannot convenientlybe included in the format for Table Z-1-A. The original Table Z-1 has beendeleted from the regulation because all of the PELs in that Table havebeen included in the new Table Z-1-A. The design of this new Table Z-1-Amakes identification of all changes to PELs possible by simply comparingTransitional Limits (left side of Table) with Revised Limits (right sideof Table).OSHA has reviewed health, risk and feasibility evidence for all 428 substancesfor which changes to the PEL were considered. In each instance where arevised or new PEL is adopted, OSHA has determined that the new limitssubstantially reduce a significant risk of material impairment of healthor functional capacity among American workers, and that the new limitsare technologically and economically feasible. This determination has beenbased on further review of the material discussed in the Proposal, publiccomments and a detailed review of the entire record for this rulemaking.OSHA's analysis of all the data available following the issuance of theProposal, receipt of comments and testimony during the public hearing resultedin changes to the proposed PELs. Details of these changes and determinationof the PELs adopted in this regulation are included as part of the discussionof specific substances in Section VI. The changes noted above include:(a) Reducing the PEL noted in the proposal;(b) Increasing the PEL (not to exceed the existing Table Z-1 PEL) notedin the proposal; and(c) Identifying the acceptability of respirators, due to feasibility considerations,to achieve compliance with the PEL for a small number of specific operationsinvolving 4 substances.The final Standard in 29 CFR 1910.1000 covers a total of 600 substances,this includes 428 substances for which OSHA opened the rulemaking processfor consideration of revising or establishing new PELs.(1) Addition of PELs for 164 new substances.(2) Adoption of more protective PELs for 212 substances.(3) No changes for 52 substances which were considered in this rulemaking.In addition to these changes, the new final standard in 29 CFR 1910.1000reprints existing exposure limits for the following substances which wereeither not covered or not considered for change in this rulemaking.(a) No change to existing PELs for 9 substances which are currently undergoing6(b) rulemaking.(b) No change to existing PELs for 3 substances (benzene, cotton dust,and formaldehyde) where some segments are not covered by an individual6(b) Regulation.(c) PELs for 160 substances, which are unchanged, and were not evaluatedduring this rulemaking.The final rule also includes minor changes to the introductory text, anddefinitions for the tabular listing of the new PELs in 29 CFR 1910.1000.Specific changes between the Proposal and the final Regulation are notedbelow:<ITAG tagnum="16">(A) </ITAG><T3>Reducing the PEL</T3><ITAG tagnum="14">(1) Camphor</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(2) Fluorine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(3) Perchloroethylene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">(B) </ITAG><T3>Increasing PEL (Less Than the Previous PEL in 29 CFR 1910.1000)</T3><ITAG tagnum="14">(1) Acetone</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(2) Acetonitrile</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(3) Ammonia</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(4) Borates</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(5) Carbon disulfide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(6) Carbon tetrachloride</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(7) Chlorine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(8) Chloroform</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(9) Grain dust</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(10) Mesityl Oxide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(11) Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(12) Trichloroethylene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(13) Wood dust</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">(C) </ITAG><T3>Increasing PEL to Previously Existing Level in 29 CFR 1910.1000</T3><ITAG tagnum="14">(1) Acetic acid</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(2) Calcium oxide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(3) Chromium metal</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(4) DDT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(5) Iron oxide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(6) Oil mist</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(7) o-Toluidine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(8) Physical Irritants: 17 individual substances which might otherwisebe classified as ``Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated'' (PNOR) and thegeneric PNOR classification.

This includes general discussions of healtheffects in the introductory material to the individual sub-parts of SectionVI, as well as detailed discussions for 428 substances.The revised PELs will protect workers against a wide variety of healtheffects which could cause material impairment of health or functional capacity.This includes protection against catastrophic effects previously notedas well as more subtle effects resulting in decrements to the central nervoussystem which produce significant sensory irritation. For each substance,the health evidence in the record provides an adequate basis for establishinga new or revised PEL.Because of the nature of this rulemaking, OSHA relied heavily on the alreadypublished and widely accepted Threshold Limit Values (TLV) published bythe American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) andthe Recommended Exposure Limits (RELs) developed by the National Institutefor Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). OSHA considered both the TLVsand RELs in making its own independent judgment regarding selection ofthe proper PEL.Table Z-1-A is designed to include all substances covered by this regulationwhether or not the PEL has been changed and whether or not a separate rulemakingis involved.For four substances used in specific operations, the full record indicatesthat it is presently not technically feasible to achieve the PEL whichis necessary (based on available health information) through engineeringcontrols. For these few specific operations, the use of engineering controlsto fully achieve the new PEL is required only where the Assistant Secretarydemonstrates that such controls are feasible. In the absence of such afinding by the Assistant Secretary, the employer must use engineering controlsto meet at least the level of the PEL existing prior to this revision aslisted in Table Z-1-A (Transitional Limits columns), and Tables Z-2 andZ-3. However, any methods of control may be used in these identified situationsto achieve the new PELs noted in Table Z-1-A. The specific operating situationsfalling in this category are identified in the individual substance discussionsin Section VI, and the general concept is discussed in the Summary andExplanation of the Standard (Section VIII).A phased enforcement schedule of 6 months (any control methods) followingthe March 1, 1989, effective date and approximately 4 years (December 31,1992) following the regulation publication date (engineering controls preferred)is adopted. In certain circumstances, the December 31, 1992, deadline maybe extended to December 31, 1993. See 29 CFR 1910.1000(f) in Section Xof this preamble.The final regulation is limited to consideration of revising the PELs.There is no consideration of the ancillary requirements which are typicallydeveloped as part of individual substance rulemaking but were not includedin the original andSection; 1910.1000 standard. OSHA has published ANPR'sfor Exposure Monitoring (53 FR 32591-32595), and Medical Surveillance (53FR 32595-32598), and is developing a proposal covering revision to therespirator provisions of the OSHA Standards. OSHA has issued a final ruleexpanding the Hazard Communication Standard.While medical surveillance, exposure monitoring and other industrial hygienepractices are important, OSHA is not in a position to develop these requirementswhile at the same time developing PELs for several hundred substances.OSHA has determined that lowering exposures through the development ofreduced PELs is of higher priority because it is more effective in reducingoccupational diseases and material impairment of health. These ancillaryrequirements will be addressed as priorities dictate.OSHA has also determined that it is appropriate to limit this rulemakingto the General Industry sector. Application to the Construction, Maritimeand Agriculture Segments may require some modifications to this proposedrule because of differences in exposures and work situations in the establishedPELs for these segments, and differences regarding feasibility for thesesectors. OSHA will pursue this as part of second stage rulemaking and hasinformally notified the Construction Advisory Committee of its plans.The average annual cost, per establishment affected by this rule, is estimatedto range from $77,000 for petroleum refining (SIC 29) down to $400 peryear for auto dealers (SIC 55). The annual cost is approximately $150 perworker protected, and is never more than a fraction of 1% of sales andless than 2% of profits (usually substantially less) except for a veryfew segments. Benefits will accrue to approximately 4.5 million workerswho are currently exposed in excess of the PEL and are expected to includethe reduction of over 55,000 occupational illness cases, including almost24,000 lost workday illness cases and approximately 520,000 lost workdaysannually. If not prevented, these illnesses would eventually result inapproximately 700 fatalities each year.OSHA will continue its practice of rulemaking for individual substanceswhen substance specific regulations are necessary and appropriate. An expandeddiscussion is provided in Section IV-D.OSHA has also considered the concerns identified regarding the need forextensively tested analytical methods (Ex. 3-960; Ex. 8-47) for enforcementpurposes. OSHA believes that enforcement can be initiated without suchdetailed methods. The OSHA docket includes: (1) Reference to a fully developedand extensively tested OSHA or NIOSH sampling and analytical procedureor, (2) a description of an OSHA in-house sampling and analytical methodfor all but the seven substances listed in Table IV-E-1. OSHA thereforebelieves there will be no problems with enforcement of the PELs for allbut seven substances. This is consistent with conclusions of NIOSH regardingimplementation (Ex. 8-47). Since development of sampling and analyticalprocedures is a dynamic, rapidly progressing technology, OSHA also believesit is appropriate to adopt PELs for these seven substances, but stay enforcementof these PELs until adequate sampling and analytical methods are available.At such time, OSHA will publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> its determination that such methods exist (togetherwith a copy of the method), and indicate the proposed effective date forenforcement of the PEL for the substance in question.As resources permit, OSHA will attempt to initiate a program in conjunctionwith NIOSH to develop more extensively tested sampling and analytical methodsfor those substances where only in-house methods are noted in the Proposal.OSHA believes that this balanced approach is consistent with the statutoryrequirements of the OSH Act.<ITAG tagnum="85">II.

Pertinent Legal Authority</ITAG>The publication of a final standard is authorized by sections 6 and 8 ofthe Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (the Act), 29 U.S.C. 655and 657. Section 6(b)(5) governs the issuance of occupational safety andhealth standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents.It states:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary in promulgating standards dealing with toxic materialsor harmful physical agents under this subsection shall set the standardwhich most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis ofthe best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairmentof health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposureto the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his workinglife. Development of standards under this subsection shall be based uponresearch, demonstrations, experiments, and such other information as maybe appropriate. In addition to the attainment of the highest degree ofhealth and safety protection for the employee, other considerations shallbe the latest available scientific data in the field, the feasibility ofstandards, and experience gained under this and other health and safetylaws. Whenever practicable, the standard promulgated shall be expressedin terms of objective criteria and of the performance desired.</ITAG>Section 3 (8) defines an occupational safety and health standard as ``astandard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or morepractices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessaryor appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.''The Supreme Court has held under the Act that the Secretary, before issuingany new standard, must determine that it is reasonably necessary and appropriateto remedy a significant risk of material health impairment. <T3>Industrial union Department </T3>v.<T3> American Petroleum Institute, (IUD</T3> v.<T3> API).</T3> 488 U.S. 607 (1980). The Court stated that ``before hecan promulgate any permanent health or safety standard, the Secretary isrequired to make a threshold finding that a place of employment is unsafein the sense that significant risks are present and can be eliminated orlessened by a change in practices'' (448 U.S. at 642). The Court also stated``that the Act does limit the Secretary's power to require the eliminationof significant risk'' (488 U.S. 644, n. 49).The Court indicated, however, that the significant risk determination is``not a mathematical straitjacket,'' and that ``OSHA is not required tosupport its finding that a significant risk exists with anything approachingscientific certainty.'' The Court ruled that ``a reviewing court [is] togive OSHA some leeway where its findings must be made on the frontiersof scientific knowledge [and that] * * * the Agency is free to use conservativeassumptions in interpreting the data with respect to carcinogens, riskingerror on the side of over protection rather than under protection'' (448U.S. at 655).The Court also stated that ``while the Agency must support its findingthat a certain level of risk exists with substantial evidence, we recognizethat its determination that a particular level of risk is `significant'will be based largely on policy considerations.'' (488 U.S. at 655, n.62).After OSHA determines that a significant risk exists and that such riskcan be reduced or eliminated by the proposed standard, it must set a standardwhich is technologically and economically feasible. In <T3>American Textile Manufacturers Institute </T3>v.<T3> Donovan,</T3> 452 U.S. 490, 531, n. 32 (1981) the Supreme Court heldthat ``cost-benefit analysis is not required by statute because feasibilityanalysis is.'' The aim is to set the lowest feasible level necessary toeliminate significant risk.As previously noted OSHA is required under its statutory authority to ``setthe standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, onthe basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffermaterial impairment of health or functional capacity even if such employeehas regular exposure to the hazard dealt with by such standard for theperiod of this working life'' under the provisions of 6(b)(5) of the OSHAct. ``Material impairment'' is therefore a term which needs to be consideredwhen issuing standards.In this rulemaking, OSHA is considering establishing new or revised PELsfor over 400 separate substances. The health effects for these substancescover a wide spectrum of severity including: Life threatening effects;disabling effects; various diseases; irritation to different organs ortissues; and changes in organ functions indicative of future health decrements.The statutory requirements in section 3(8) and 6(b)(5) are quoted above.Other statutory criteria are set forth in section (2)(b) which states:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Congress declares it to be its purposes and policy, through theexercise of its powers to regulate commerce among the several States andwith foreign nations and to provide for the general welfare, to assureso far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthfulworking conditions and to preserve our human resources.</ITAG>One of the earlier Senate drafts of the OSHA bill did not include the word``material'' before the word ``impairment.'' That word was added by anamendment of Senator Dominick. The Senator stated in respect to that amendment:<ITAG tagnum="21">What we were trying to do in the bill_unfortunately, we did not havethe proper wording or the proper drafting_was to say that when we are dealingwith toxic agents or physical agents, we ought to take such steps as arefeasible and practical to provide an atmosphere within which a person'shealth or safety would not be affected. Unfortunately, we had languageproviding that anyone would be assured that no one would have a hazard,or at least, we would require the Secretary to set standards so stating,and that in the HEW standard there would be a requirement to proceed onthat basis so that no one would have any problem for the rest of his workinglife. It was an unrealistic standard. As modified, we would be approachingthe problem by looking at the problem and setting a standard or criterionwhich would not result in harm (Legislative History p. 502).</ITAG>The D.C. Circuit Court considered the concept of material impairment andreviewed the Legislative History in the Lead Case.It stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The essential question under Section 6(b)(5) for this case is whetherOSHA acted within the limits of this mandate to establish ``material''impairment of health when it set a standard designed to protect workersfrom the subclinical effects of lead. As a statutory matter, after examiningprecedent and legislative history, we hold that Section 6(b)(5) empowersOSHA to set a PEL that prevents the subclinical effects of lead that lieon a continuum shared with overt lead disease. (United Steelworkers v.Marshall, 647 F. 2d at 1248-49. See also the more extended discussion there).</ITAG>The legislative history and judicial analysis indicate that OSHA is totake a balanced but protective approach. Some impairments are so slighta discomfort that they are not material and do not provide a basis forregulation. A complaint of minor discomfort, in and of itself, is not materialimpairment. However, the OSH Act is designed to be protective of workersand is to protect against impairment with less impact than severe impairment.These health effects are related to two different types of exposure: Acuteand chronic. Because of the difference between the health effects associatedwith these two types of exposures, OSHA must consider different types ofPELs (TWA, STEL, or ceiling) to protect against material impairment.OSHA asked for comment on the subject of ``material impairment'' (Question21), especially with regard to whether sensory irritation should be consideredto be material impairment. There was a relatively limited amount of comment.The most complete response was provided by NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) which stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The recognition of sensory irritation as potentially being ``materialimpairment of health'' is consistent with the current scientific consensusrelated to health effects of environmental agents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mucous membrane irritants can cause increased blink frequency andtearing; nasal discharge, congestion, and sneezing; and cough, sputum production,chest discomfort, wheezing, chest tightness, and dyspnea. Work environmentsoften require levels of physical and mental performance considerably greaterthan encountered in daily living. Even in the absence of any permanentimpairment, the symptoms listed can interfere with job performance andsafety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mucous membrane irritation can result in inflammation, which may leadto increased susceptibility to nonspecific irritants and infectious agents.For example, experimental ozone exposure in humans results in increasedairway reactivity. Also, studies of exposure to environmental tobacco smokehave shown irritative symptoms and evidence of increased frequency of respiratorytract illnesses in young children and decreased pulmonary function in adults.* * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mucous membrane irritation is associated with respiratory illnesses,depending on the composition of specific exposure and on the dose, duration,and frequency of exposure. No universally applicable conclusion can bedrawn at this time regarding the association between irritative symptomsand permanent injury or dysfunction. Where certain individuals show nomeasurable impairment after an exposure, even when experiencing irritativesymptoms, others may develop identifiable dysfunction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Aside from the effects of irritations, mucous membrane exposure mayresult in absorption of a substance, with resultant systemic toxicity.An inflamed mucous membrane may be an even more effective route of absorption,either for the irritant or for other substances. Furthermore, injury tobronchopulmonary membranes can impair removal of particulates from therespiratory system.</ITAG>Thus, according to NIOSH, sensory irritants interfere with job performanceand safety, cause inflammation, may increase the victim's susceptibilityto other irritants and infectious agents, lead to permanent injury or dysfunction,or permit greater absorption of hazardous substances (Ex. 8-47). In sum,NIOSH and most other respondents agree that sensory irritation caused byoccupational exposure to the irritant substances included in this finalrule constitutes a material impairment of health (see Section VI.C.3).Of course, irritation also covers a spectrum of effects, some serious andsome trivial. Hence, complaints of minor irritation would not in and ofitself constitute material impairment. In addition, OSHA would weigh irritationwith physical manifestations more heavily than irritation with purely subjectiveresponses. This does not mean that purely subjective responses would notconstitute material impairment. That judgment would depend on the magnitudeof the irritation.OSHA also believes that clinical, tissue or organ changes, or properlydocumented pain, chest tightness, migraine headache or similar reactionsreflected in responses by persons, may also represent material impairmentof health. Each of these are considered on a case-by-case basis in thisRulemaking. OSHA believes that its approach is consistent with the Actand Congressional intent regarding material impairment of health. All of the revised or new PELs in this Rulemaking are within reasonableinterpretation of a general approach to identifying situations involvingmaterial impairment of health. In a few instances, PELs noted in the Proposalhave been modified, or deleted, because it was determined that the proposedlevel was not needed to reduce a significant risk of material impairmentof health. These substances are identified in the Preamble.OSHA's analyses regarding material impairment of health, as applied inthis Rulemaking, are provided in three separate ways. First, they are includedin the introductory discussion for Sections VI-C-1 through VI-C-18 in thePreamble. Second, the discussion of each of the 428 substances containshealth effect information for all new or revised PELs. Third, the followingdiscussion provides examples and general guidance regarding the OSHA decisionprocess, and accounts for the severity spectrum of health effects, andthe separate cases involving chronic and acute exposures. As previously indicated, health effects cover a wide range of severitylevels. A precise delineation between material impairment and non-materialimpairment is not possible since a variety of factors must be considered,such as the composite health effect and frequency and duration of the effect,to determine if a substance represents a material impairment of health.For example, nerve damage would normally constitute material impairmentof health. However, a small reduction in nerve conductivity may not constitutematerial impairment. Moreover, an occupational, transitory, non-progressiveand/or non-intensive coughing reaction may represent non-material impairment.Major intensification of some of these factors could result in a healtheffect which represents material impairment of health. Consequently, general considerations can be stated but they must be appliedon a case-by-case basis taking into account the scientific evidence, publiccomments and agency expertise.OSHA has concluded that updating the Z-Tables to reflect recent informationis the highest priority for the Agency. This will reduce exposure limitsfor approximately 212 substances regulated currently by the Z-Tables andadd exposure limits for approximately 164 substances which are currentlyunregulated. The health literature indicates this must be accomplishedto improve worker health; it is one of Congress' concurrent goals and willgreatly increase occupational health protection for a very large numberof workers. In order to accomplish this high priority task in a reasonable time inthe light of limited administrative resources, it is necessary to narrowsomewhat the issues to be faced by the Agency in this proceeding. Consequently,it is necessary to delay other worthwhile goals and concurrent Congressionalpurposes.This approach is consistent with the general principles of administrativelaw. An Agency may set priorities within the framework of its statutoryauthority. Secondly, an Agency may take substantial steps towards its statutorygoals, without having to achieve them completely, when Agency resourcesare not sufficient to complete all aspects initially. Congress recognized that the Secretary could not address all occupationalsafety and health problems simultaneously. It therefore gave the Secretarydiscretion to set priorities in exercising his rulemaking authority. Assection 6(g) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. 655(g), states:<ITAG tagnum="21">In determining the priority for establishing standards under thissection, the Secretary shall give due regard to the urgency of the needfor mandatory safety and health standards for particular industries, trades,crafts, occupations, businesses, workplaces or work environments.</ITAG>In proposing this addition to the Act, Senator Javits explained that itspurpose was ``to relieve the Secretary of the necessity for waiting topromulgate whatever standards he wishes to promulgate across the boardbut, rather, allowing him to yield to more urgent demands before he triesto meet others.'' Leg. Hist 505. Thus, the Act has ``built in flexibilities''that the Secretary may use, such as establishing ``the priorities betweenthe various occupations that may require standards.'' <T3>National Congress of Hispanic American Citizens </T3>v. <T3>Usery,</T3> 554 F. 2d 1196, 1199 (D.C. Cir. 1977); see also <T3>National Congress </T3>v. <T3>Marshall, </T3>626 F.2d 882 (D.C. Cir. 1979). The flexibility expressedin the statute and legislative history is consistent with the well-establishedprinciple that an administrator may adopt a ``rational, `one step at atime' approach'' to rulemaking. <T3>National Roofing Contractors Ass'n</T3> v.<T3> Brennan,</T3> 495 F. 2d 1294, 1299 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S.1105 (1974) (OSHA roofing standard); cf., <T3>Industrial Union Dept.</T3> v. <T3>American Petroleum Institute,</T3> 488 U.S. 607, 663 (1980) (Burger,concurring) (OSHA can act in its legislative capacity ``to focus on onlyone aspect of a larger problem''); <T3>United Steelworkers</T3> v. <T3>Auchter,</T3> 763 F. 2d 728, 738 (3rd Cir. 1985) (Although OSHA's decisionto exclude workers in some industries from a standard requires explanation.``[s]ection 6(g) clearly permits the Secretary to set priorities for theuse of the agency's resources and to promulgate standards sequentially.'');<T3>IUD </T3>v. <T3>Hodgson</T3>, 499 F. 2d 467, 480 n. 31 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (``The [OSHA]statutory scheme is generally calculated to give the Secretary broad responsibilityfor determining when standards are required and what those standards shouldbe.''). OSHA has concluded that setting exposure limits for the large number ofsubstances involved in this rulemaking has priority at this stage overexploring the need for accompanying medical surveillance, exposure monitoringand industrial hygiene provisions for a much smaller number of substances.Section 6(b)(7) of the Act, of course, indicates that ``where appropriate''such provisions are to be included. That was a concurrent goal of Congressas was Congress's goal to lower exposure for the many unregulated or inadequatelyregulated substances when scientific data indicate lower exposures areneeded. However, OSHA has inadequate resources to accomplish both goalsat this time. Lower exposures is a higher priority because it is more effectivein reducing diseases and material impairments of health. OSHA has already addressed some of section 6(b)(7)'s goals, as they relateto labels and warnings, in the generic Hazard Communication Standard, 29CFR 1910.1200. It is working on a standard to improve respirator use forall chemicals (47 FR 20803). It is considering generic regulation for exposuremonitoring (53 FR 32591-32595) and medical surveillance (53 FR 32595-32598).OSHA does not have the resources to conclude this rulemaking in any reasonabletime, and also consider these issues. OSHA does have legal authority not to address ancillary provisions in thisrulemaking and determinations about the appropriateness of ancillary provisionshave not been made. That is a rational use of its priority setting authorityin the light of OSHA's limited resources. The language of section 6(b)(7)is not an absolute requirement to include such provisions and this is an``appropriate'' circumstance not to include them. The actions already initiatedby OSHA indicate it is facing the issue of ancillary provisions in a responsibleand reasonable manner. OSHA is utilizing its priority setting authority for several other matters.There are several substances (both carcinogens and non-carcinogens) wheremore detailed analysis of the evidence might in the future lead to theconclusion that there is remaining significant risk. If that were the casein a single substance rulemaking, OSHA would explore that issue in greatdepth and do much more extended economic analysis of several differentexposure levels to determine what the lowest feasible level might be. Past experience has shown this to be a major undertaking both from a healthand economic point of view. OSHA, for example, spends an average of $500,000and takes one year of study to determine the lowest feasible level fora <T3>single</T3> substance. OSHA does not have the resources to engage inthat kind of analysis for more than a few substances. The attempt to doso in this rulemaking would significantly reduce the chances of it everbeing completed and would result in far more workers being exposed to significantrisk in exchange for the incremental risk reduction attained by furtherlowering the PEL for a small group of substances in this Rulemaking.When evidence has been available to determine that the proposed level resultedin remaining significant risk and a lower level was feasible, OSHA hasissued that lower level. Three chemicals fit that category in this rulemaking.Two are based on OSHA's analysis of evidence presented by NIOSH and a third,perchloroethylene, is based on OSHA's analysis of evidence supplied bythe Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union and the dry cleaningindustry.  OSHA has indicated that further, more extensive analysis may lead to theconclusion that significant risk remains for other substances. However,the extensive investment of resources needed to arrive at such conclusionswould be determined by the Agency's future priorities.  OSHA's first priority is to achieve substantial reductions in significantrisk for this large number of substances. The accomplishment of this goalwill create the greatest health benefits for the American worker. OSHA'sdecisions in this Rulemaking are consistent with the evidence on risk andfeasibility which is available at this time. Further consideration of theseissues for specific substances can be achieved in future rulemakings asnew evidence becomes available and as priorities indicate.  OSHA concludes this is both rational priority setting and a reasonableintegration of its priority setting authority and relevant case law. Clearlymulti-issue and multi-substance rulemaking require a different balancingthan single substance or single issue rulemaking.  OSHA has met legal requirements also in the regulation of carcinogens inthe light of priorities and Agency resources. Potential carcinogens tendto require far more administrative resources per substance to regulate,in part because their regulation tends to create more controversy. Thereare a number of expert organizations which analyze and develop lists ofsuspect or probable carcinogens. These organizations include ACGIH, NIOSH,the National Toxicological Program (NTP) and the International Agency forResearch on Cancer (IARC). These organizations utilize somewhat differentcriteria and categories for their lists.  The ACGIH TLVs include some substances which it categorizes as carcinogens,but does not set the exposure limit based on carcinogenicity. It includesother substances which it may or may not categorize as carcinogens butfor which the exposure limit is set taking into account carcinogenicity.It is only this last category which OSHA considered as carcinogens in itsproposal. (This is a separate issue from what exposure limit is set). IfNIOSH recommended a different limit for a chemical in this grouping, OSHAconsidered which of the recommended limits was best supported. OSHA concludesthis was a rational use of its priority setting authority. A categorizationof carcinogenicity along with a proposed exposure limit is much more usefulto OSHA as a starting point for its analysis than a categorization withouta recommended numerical limit. IARC never recommends numerical limits andin some instances neither has NIOSH.  Attemps to analyze for carcinogenicity a substantially larger number ofsubstances would again require far more scientific and administrative resourcesthan OSHA has available and would probably prevent the prompt completionof this rulemaking. In addition OSHA has spent much of its past effortsin regulating carcinogens. It concludes that it is important to concentratesome of its efforts through this project on noncarcinogenic health hazards.Substances which cause liver/kidney or cardiovascular disease can be justas deadly as carcinogens and can cause higher risks.  Accordingly, OSHA concludes it is a rational use of its priority authoritynot to consider for regulation as a carcinogen every sustance included,for which there is some evidence or recommendation that it may be carcinogenic.Such substances often require exposure limits to protect against otherhealth hazards they cause, which results in OSHA setting limits in thisrulemaking based on non-carcinogenic effects. In these circumstance 29CFR Part 1990 need not apply when there is no determination to considerregulating a substance as a carcinogen.  There are several substances which OSHA proposed regulating as carcinogens,for which participants submitted evidence to the contrary. In some of thosecases OSHA has concluded that it is inappropriate to regulate a substanceas a carcinogen at this time because further analysis is necessary. Inseveral cases participants submitted evidence that substances includedin the proposal which OSHA did not propose to regulate as carcinogens shouldbe regulating as carcinogens. When OSHA concluded there was sufficientevidence and analysis to meet legal requirements, OSHA has in this finalrule regulated the substance as a carcinogen. However, as just stated,OSHA has not itself attempted to analyze further for carcinogenicity substanceswhich it did not propose regulated as a carcinogen, unless participantssupplied relevent evidence.  For the substances OSHA is regulating as carcinogens, it has met all requirementsof <T3>IUD </T3>v.<T3> API</T3> and has acted consistently with 29 CFR Part 1990. Specifically,OSHA reviewed all data to determine whether there were studies of sufficientmerit to determine that the substance was qualitatively a carcinogen. Secondly, OSHA contracted with Dr. Nathan J. Karch, President of Karchandamp; Associates, Inc., consultant experts in risk assessment, to analyzethe available studies for two purposes (Ex. 85): first to determine whetherthere was sufficient evidence to perform a quantitative risk assessmentor to state the reasons why there was not; second, to perform a quantitativerisk assessment where the studies permitted, using techniques generallyaccepted by the scientific community. The risk assessments were presentedin the preamble (52 FR 21190-209) and elaborated upon in Dr. Karch's statement.Dr. Karch responded to questions on the risk assessments. (OSHA did notask Dr. Karch to independently review the strength of the qualitative datesince OSHA had preliminarily made that review.)  Utilizing these data, public comments and OSHA analysis of the data, OSHAhas issued exposure limits which will substantially reduce significantrisk and are feasible. Where a public participant has supplied evidencethat a lower level than that proposed would further reduce significantrisk and was feasible, OSHA has promulgated that lower level.  In other words, OSHA's decisions in this Rulemaking are based on the entireevidence in the public record, and that the final PEL substantially reducessignficant risk and is feasible. OSHA may reconsider the issues for individualsubstances as further information becomes available.For the reasons stated above and in line with its priority setting authority,OSHA concludes it has authority, in the circumstances of a rulemaking whichconsidered changes to PELs for 428 substances, not to explore those issuesat this time. This issue and the regulation of other substances as carcinogensmay be considered in future 6(b) rulemakings where priorities indicatethe issue is important and when administrative and scientific resourcesbecome available. OSHA concludes this is consistent with its legal authorityand reasonable health policy.A few of the substances which OSHA is regulating principally for non-carcinogeniceffects, but for which there is some evidence of carcinogenicity, fit intoan additional category. In these cases there was uncertainty concerningwhich of two levels would eliminate significant risk of the non-carcinogeniceffect. In those cases OSHA used the evidence of carcinogenicity as anadditional factor in determining whether the lower level was appropriate.Most of the chemicals OSHA is regulating are not carcinogens. There areeffects which occur immediately, or a relatively short time after exposure.Sometimes the effects are reversible after removal from exposure and treatment,and sometimes the effects are not.Many of these substances are believed to have effective thresholds, thatis there is a level of exposure above which some number of persons willsuffer the effect. There is a level somewhat below that, where it appearsthat few persons would suffer the effect, and there is a lower level wherescientists are more confident of that conclusion. At levels below a properlywell defined threshold the risk would not be significant. However, theremay be a smaller group of employees who might be susceptible at very lowlevels.The studies which tend to be performed, examine relatively small groupsof animals or persons exposed at one or several levels. A determinationis made at which of these levels effects are seen and at which they arenot.The Supreme Court in <T3>IUD</T3> v. <T3>API</T3> was faced with the situation, as is often the case with carcinogens,that high risk is known at relatively high levels of exposure. But scientistsdo not have direct measurements of what the risk may be at lower levels.Indeed for statistical and methodological reasons they may never be inposition to directly measure risk at lower levels or indeed to determineif it is ever eliminated. Consequently, modeling techniques must be usedto estimate risk at various levels so as to determine the significanceof risk at various levels.In the case of this rulemaking the type of evidence available makes suchmodeling techniques generally unnecessary for significant risk determinations.The studies provide direct evidence of whether or not there is an effectand the probability of that effect occurring at the levels to which theAgency is regulating. Consequently, a judgment can be made whether theeffect is a significant risk directly from the studies. Similarly, a judgmentcan be made directly from the studies whether that significant risk isreduced or eliminated.An example may illustrate this method of analysis. The current OSHA exposurelimit for hydrogen sulfide (H<T2>2</T2>S) is a 20 ppm STEL and a 50 ppm peak. There are studies showingthat at 20 ppm and perhaps below workers develop conjunctivitis, eye irritationand other ocular effects. Those effects present a significant risk of materialimpairment because they would prevent work, require medical treatment,and would make it difficult to work safely with the condition. Anotherstudy shows that the deleterious health effects do not develop in workersexposed continually at 10 ppm. Consequently OSHA is issuing a final standardof a 10 ppm TWA with a 20 ppm ceiling which should eliminate that significantrisk. Direct evidence of significant risk and its probable eliminationexist and there would be no point in applying mathematical modeling tothe data for purposes of making a significant risk determination.Often the data are not as clear cut. There may be only an effect study.There may be uncertainty about exposures levels or conflicting results.There may be a no effect study with exposure data and an effect study withoutexposure data. Studies are often of small size with fairly wide rangesof uncertainty. Consequently, they do not take into account variabilityof response among humans. Of course, many studies are based on animal dataand adjustments must be made to take into account the differences betweenhuman and animal susceptibility.However, judgments as to levels which create, reduce or eliminate significantrisk still have the greatest scientific validity in most cases when baseddirectly on specific studies. The uncertainties which exist are likelyto be magnified, rather than reduced, when combined with the uncertaintiesof modeling techniques.Accordingly OSHA concludes that the type of significant risk analysis undertakenin this rulemaking is most consistent with the studies generally availableand is a valid scientific approach. OSHA concludes it is fully consistentwith the requirements of the Supreme Court in <T3>IUD </T3>v. <T3>API</T3>.OSHA has made quantitative estimates of the benefits of this entire standard.These are discussed in Section VII D and are substantial. That analysisdemonstrates that on a general basis there is a significant risk of occupationallyrelated illness and death and that this new standard substantially reducesthat risk.Some of the exposure levels incorporate an uncertainty factor. This issometimes referred to as a ``safety factor.'' Studies are often of smallsize and, since there is a large variation in human susceptibility, a studybecause of its small size may not demonstrate an effect that actually exists.(In scientific terminology it lacks statistical power.) For this reason,it is not uncommon to set a limit below that level which the study mayhave indicated showed no effect.This has been the standard approach for recommending exposure limits fornon-carcinogens by scientists and health experts in the field for manyyears. (See testimony of Mastromatteo (Ex. 22) and Key (Ex. 17)). Generally,a greater safety or uncertainty factor is used for more severe health effects.This use of uncertainty or safety factors in a reasonable manner generallydoes not lead to reducing exposures below the level of significance. Rather,it takes into account the likelihood that effects may exist at levels belowthe level of the study.Of course, use of uncertainty factors or safety factors is even more clearlyjustified when the studies available determine only a level at which thereis a significant risk of a health effect exists rather than the level atwhich there clearly is no significant risk, or when animal studies areused. Clearly, to substantially reduce significant risk, an exposure levelmust be set below the level where significant risk exists in humans. Similarly,to take into account the possibility of interspecies variability, a levelset for humans usually is set below the observed no effect level in ananimal. See the extended discussion in the Health Effects Section, specificallySection VI A.Section 6(b)(5) of the OSH Act states that standards shall be based onmany factors including ``the best available evidence,'' the ``latest availablescientific data in the field,'' and ``experience gained under this andother health and safety laws.'' OSHA concludes that its approach meetsthese provisions.OSHA utilized the research and recommendations of two expert organizations,NIOSH and ACGIH, as the starting point for its analysis. Those organizationsregularly review the literature and update their recommendations. (Seetestimony of Mastromatteo (Ex. 22) and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47)). When participantsbrought to OSHA's attention other studies, made other recommendations forexposures limits or the proposal was controversial, OSHA fully reviewedthe available scientific information. (The final preamble does not alwaysdiscuss studies which OSHA did not believe were important or relevant tothe determination of an exposure limit.) Where there was little or no commenton particular parts of the OSHA proposal, and the evidence OSHA reliedon appeared substantial, OSHA did not attempt additional searches of theliterature.OSHA concludes that this is a rational approach to make use of the bestavailable and latest scientific information for making final decisionson exposure limits. An approach attempting to analyze and discuss everysingle study for substances where the proposed exposure limit is not seriouslydisputed would not add to the quality of OSHA's final decisions and wouldinterfere with the statutory goal to protect employees from material healthimpairments. As discussed elsewhere OSHA also relied upon its experiencein making final decisions as is encouraged by Section 6(b)(5).It has been suggested to OSHA that two of its selected categories do notconstitute material impairment of health. The first category includes particulateswhich cause physical irritation and other effects. In the Proposal, OSHAfollowed for clarity purposes the historical terminology of ``nuisance''dust which is misleading. The term ``nuisance'' is used by ACGIH to coverdusts that, although they do not cause pneumoconiosis or permanent scarringof the lungs, can cause many material health impairments such as chronicbronchitis, chronic throat irritation, skin irritation or eye inflammation.Consequently there is a health need for an exposure limit for all particulates.See the discussion under particulates (Section VI, Health Effects).Secondly, three chemicals are listed as odorants by ACGIH and also haveother effects. In these cases OSHA has not changed the existing PEL. Theselevels were identified in the Proposal and there was not significant commentthat the limits should be raised. No new chemicals are regulated as odorants.Accordingly, OSHA has not had to visit the issue of when an odorant hasbecome so severe as to constitute a material impairment of health.OSHA feasibility determinations are based on both the statute and on aconsistent and extensive body of case law extending over its entire history.In addition to <T3>ATMI</T3> (supra) see for example: <T3>AFL-CIO</T3> v. <T3>Hodgson</T3>, 499 F. 2d 467 (D.C.

Rather it ``will reduce the strength of the presumptiona firm will have to overcome in justifying its use of respirators'' inan enforcement or variance action. <T3>United Steelworkers, </T3>pp. 1272-73. See also <T3>Building and Construction Trades</T3> (Supra).In addition, a gloss of experience has been added to this general legalguidance. In the two standards where OSHA thought at the time that it wasregulating to the limits of its legal authority on feasibility, subsequentstudies indicated the standard was achieved more easily than OSHA predicted.OSHA predicted the cotton dust standard would cost $500 million in 1977dollars whereas industry predicted twice the cost and anticipated substantialtechnical problems. As a matter of fact, a later detailed study indicatedthat the standard cost only $250 million in 1983 dollars, improved industrycompetitiveness and productivity as well, and improved health more thanpredicted. See 50 FR 51121, 51164-67 (Dec. 13, 1985).OSHA's contractor predicted that the OSHA vinyl chloride standard couldnot generally be achieved with engineering controls and the attempt wouldcost $1.5 billion. As a matter of fact, compliance was achieved with engineeringcontrols within three years at a cost of less than 10% of that predicted.See 49 FR 5001, 5253 (Jan. 22, 1980).In this rulemaking, OSHA concludes that it has demonstrated feasibilitywithout taking that concept to the full limits of its legal authority.Many of the substances regulated constitute acute hazards with apparentthresholds; the limit set to protect health does not approach the limitsthat could feasibly be achieved.There are some substances covered by this regulation for which furtheranalysis might indicate a lower limit is needed, possibly the lowest feasiblelimit. However, the limit set is clearly within the limits of feasibility.In the case of a few substances, industry has argued that the limit proposedwas not technically and/or economically ``feasible.'' In some circumstanceswhere OSHA believed it did not have enough evidence of feasibility in therecord to support the level proposed, it has raised the limit to that levelwhich the evidence available demonstrated is clearly feasible. In othercircumstances where industry contended that engineering controls couldnot achieve the proposed level in a specific operation, and there was notsufficient evidence in the record indicating that it could be achievedwith engineering and work practice controls, the preamble indicates thatrespirator use may be appropriate. In any event, the burden of proof wouldbe on OSHA in an enforcement action to demonstrate the level in that operationcould be achieved with engineering and work practice controls. Since OSHA'sfeasibility analysis was based on what industry is already achieving orwhat could be achieved with standard ``off-the-shelf'' technology, thereare few if any cases where OSHA is attempting to force technology. Several participants specifically argue that the proposed level was infeasiblefor a specific because in a specific substance operation it could not beachieved with engineering controls. As the case law clearly indicates,that does not make a standard infeasible. OSHA has in several cases concludedit did not have enough evidence to demonstrate that a level could be achievedwith engineering controls in a specific operation. The case law clearlyindicates that this does not make a standard infeasible. (See for example,<T3>ASARCO </T3>and <T3>United Steelworkers</T3>, supra). The industry does not have the burdenof proving the technical infeasibility of engineering controls in an enforcementcase involving these operations which are specifically identified in SectionVII. The burden of proof would be on OSHA to prove that the level couldbe attained with engineering and work practice controls in an enforcementaction if OSHA believed that was the case. A few participants argued that, because engineering controls might notbe appropriate in certain maintenance operations or in occasional or intermittentoperations, the level set was therefore infeasible. First, these conditionsrelate to individual operations and do not indicate general difficultiesof compliance with engineering controls. Secondly, as OSHA has stated,for some maintenance and intermittent operations, respirators may be theappropriate control methodology. See 52 FR 34549 for example. Finally, 29 CFR 1910.1000(e) requires the use of engineering controls whenfeasible. If they are not feasible, the employer may use respirators. Consequently,this standard does not become infeasible simply because engineering controlsmay not achieve the PEP in a specific operation. OSHA has a variety of data on technical feasibility. These include exposuredata indicating that required levels are already being achieved by someemployers in a sector. It also includes judgment by experts that standardcontrols have achieved or can achieve the required level in that or inanalogous operations. Finally, the docket includes a significant amountof information on available existing control technology for each substance.(See for example, Ex. 6 and NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) reports).OSHA concludes that it was not its burden to demonstrate the technicalfeasibility for the substances it is setting new or more protective levelsfor. This is analyzed in Section VII. OSHA also concludes, as discussed in the Economic Feasibility section,that the standard is economically feasible. Indeed, the costs do not approachthe levels that would be the legal limits of economic feasibility in termsof affecting the economics of industry, either generally or by industrysector. The estimated ual cost is approximately $800 million. However,approximately, 4.5 million employees receive improved health protectionmaking the cost per employee receiving additional protection approximately$150 each. The total cost is approximately $2 million per substance beingregulated. See the detailed feasibility discussion in Section VII. Secondly, the cost per industry sector is never more than a small fractionof one percent of sales and with two limited exceptions not more than 2%of net profits, assuming no costs would be shifted to consumers. As thecourts have recognized, it is likely that some costs will be shifted toconsumers. In the few subsectors where costs reflect a slightly largerpercent of profit, OSHA explains in the specific analysis of Section VIIwhy the proposed standard is feasible and will not create disruption toan industry or to competition, although it may have some temporary effectsrequiring some adjustment. OSHA's cost and economic feasibility conclusions have a high degree ofvalidity on a sector basis. OSHA has provided much data at the subsector(4 digit SIC) level and has supplied more when requested by participants.That subsector data has probative merit, but there would not be quite ashigh a degree of confidence in the exact cost totals estimated. There wassome questioning of OSHA and its economic panel on this matter. OSHA andthe economics panel pointed out that OSHA's survey was designed to havea high degree of statistical certainty at the sector level, and provideduseful evidence but not to the same high degree of statistical confidenceat a subsector level. OSHA's responsibility is to demonstrate economic feasibility for an industry.OSHA's feasibility analysis clearly shows feasibility for every sector.The costs are sufficiently low per sector to demonstrate feasibility notonly for each sector but also for each subsector. Higher subsector costswould be reflected in higher sector costs. This is confirmed by the subsectordata which OSHA initially provided or provided upon request. This alsoindicates costs are low in relation to sales and profits for subsectors.OSHA is not required to demonstrate feasibility for every plant in a subsector.At the enforcement level, an employer's demonstration of economic infeasibilityfor a particular plant may lead to an extended period of time in whichto come into compliance with engineering controls allowing the use of respiratorsduring the extended interim period. The fact that this particular standardgives all employers a long period of time in which to comply will reducefeasibility problems for the few employers with possible economic difficulties.As discussed in the approach and chronology sections, OSHA believes ithas provided the public an extensive opportunity to comment and participatein this rulemaking and has complied fully with required administrativeprocedures. Nine months advance notice of the proposal was given. The proposalcontained OSHA health reasoning for each substance proposed for revisionor addition of a PEL and cited the studies OSHA relied upon. It discussedOSHA's feasibility reasoning for each sector. Underlying health studieswere made available in the docket and are generally available in majorlibraries and/or computer data bases. The feasibility studies were alsoavailable in the docket. The public was given more than the legal minimum time to comment. The timefrom proposal to final post-hearing briefs was 5 months. An oral hearingwas held in which extensive presentations were made by participants andquestioning was permitted of OSHA, its economic panel and witnesses, NIOSHand other participants. OSHA concludes that all of its decisions are basedon substantial evidence in the docket which is analyzed in this final preamble.Several procedural objections were made during the course of the proceeding.The first was that OSHA did not permit sufficient time for comments. OSHAbelieves the public has been given not only more than the legal minimumperiod in which to comment but has been given a fair amount of time tocomment on the proposal. The rulemaking permitted 47 days after proposal for prehearing comments,oral testimony up to 79 days after proposal, post hearing evidence up to4 months after proposal and post hearing briefs up to almost 5 months afterproposal. The OSHA Act only requires 30 days for comment. See section 6(b)(2).Three Courts of Appeals have held comment periods of 30-45 days legallysufficient: <T3>Phillips Petroleum </T3>v. <T3>U.S. EPA </T3>802 F. 2d 549, 558-559 (10th Cir., 1986); <T3>North American Van Lines </T3>v. <T3>I.C.C., </T3>660 F. 2d 1087, 1092 (7th Cir., 1981) and <T3>Conn. Light </T3>v. <T3>N.P.C. </T3>672 F/2d 529, 534 D.C. Cir., 1982. The prehearing comment period alone met these requirements. In reality,and as OSHA agreed (Ex. 14 B p. 7), evidence not available by prescribeddates could be submitted as late as Oct. 7, 1988, the post hearing evidencedeadline, which was four months after proposal. Final views did not haveto be submitted until five months after the proposal. This far more thanmeets the legal minimums. All data OSHA relied upon were cited in the preamble and available in thedocket. The date were also usually available in libraries and on computerdata bases as well. Few participants were interested in more than a fewchemical and none indicated an interest in more than 20. There was timeto analyze the studies and submit comments in the time periods specified.Indeed, the trade associations and individual participants who objectedthe most about the time for comments were interested in only one chemical(carbon disulfied, sulfur dioxide, grain dust and styrene). These tradeassociations had been in existence for more than a decade and had immediateaccess to available studies, analyses and position papers to support theirviews. The unions divided up the 20 or so chemicals they expressed an interestin among the various unions and ultimatley did not object to the finalpost hearing submission dates. Interested participants submitted extensivestudies, comments and testimony averaging 3000 pages per controversialchemical. The reality was that all views were effectively presented. The second procedural issue involves post hearing comments. The OSHA proceduralrules initially grant the presiding officer authority to set the date forpost hearing comments. (29 CFR 1911.16 (g)). The presiding officer setNov. 14, 1988, for post-hearing submissions and Dec. 13, 1988, for post-hearingbriefs (Ex. 81). For the reasons just stated, OSHA concluded that these time periods werefar more than required by legal minimums or for considerations of fairness.As stated in the approach section, such an extended time frame for post-hearingsubmissions would greatly delay the completion of this action. This wouldalso interfere with OSHA's priority to complete in a timely fashion thisproject which is of such significant benefit in protecting the health ofemployees. The Chief Administrative Law Judge held that he did not have jurisdictionto change the dates set by the presiding officer. (Ex. 81 B.) Accordingly,the Secretary of Labor and OSHA exercised their authority to set prioritiesfor OSHA and by <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice of Sept. 7, 1988, (53 FR 34708) set Oct.7, 1988, for post hearing evidence and Oct. 31, 1988, for post hearingbriefs. The OSHA rule at 29 CFR 1911.4, gives authority to prescribe alternativerequirements (such as the October date set) in order to expedite the conductof the proceeding upon reasonable notice. Reasonable notice was given ofthe changed dates. There was a period of 30 days from the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice to the date that post hearing evidencewas due and OSHA gave notice prior to the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice orally and by letter that it desired tohave shorter dates for post hearing submissions than initially set. Clearly,the purpose of the new date was to expedite the rulemaking process. Accordingly,all procedural requirements have been met. See also OSHA's discussionsin Exs. 60 and 81 A on these two issues and at 53 FR 34708. Third, for several substances covered by this proceeding, OSHA had proposednew standards in the middle 1970's, held hearings and closed the record.However, no new standard was ever issued, nor was a statement made of whya new standard was not issued. There were comments on two of those substances in this rulemaking, sulfurdioxide and beryllium. In light of this circumstance and at the requestof participants, OSHA submitted the complete earlier record of those proceedingsinto the record of this rulemaking. For sulfur dioxide OSHA is issuing a new limit. OSHA has reviewed boththe old record and new submissions, and has concluded that the new levelis needed to reduce significant risk and is feasible. The discussion inthis final preamble meets the procedural requirements of section 6(b)(4)for both the prior and current rulemaking. For beryllium, OSHA is retaining the existing limit. That limit is alreadyvery low. Extensive additional evaluation would be needed to determineif that limit should be changed. Accordingly, OSHA has concluded it isnot of sufficient priority to determine if the limit should be changedat this time. Several participants stated that ACGIH was not a national consensus organizationand should not be used as a starting point for OSHA's evaluation. ACGIHis not a national consensus organization as defined by the OSH Act. However,that is not relevant to this rulemaking. Section 6(a) of the Act permittedOSHA to issue as OSHA standards, without rulemaking, national consensusstandards. However, that authority expired in May of 1973. This standardis not issued under section 6(a) but under the authority of section 6(b)of the OSH Act. OSHA intends this to be a section 6(b) standard and isfollowing all of the procedures and meeting all of the requirements ofsection 6(b). This is a 1900-page typed document covering 600 substances. As a resultof the editing process, sometimes slightly different conclusory languageis used when an identical conclusion is intended. OSHA wishes to make itclear that wherever a new or more protective exposure limit has been issued,OSHA has concluded based on evidence in the record, and its experience,that such limit is needed to substantially reduce a significant risk ofmaterial impairment of health or functional capacity. OSHA has also concludedthat such limit is technically and economically feasible.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Overview of Rulemaking </ITAG>A. History of Health Standards and Need To Revise PELs One of the principal reasons, if not the single most important basis, forCongress passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 was Congress'recognition of the need to protect workers from occupational health hazards.In the preamble to the Act, Congress stated that one of the purposes wasto protect employees by ``exploring ways to discover latent diseases, establishingcausal connections between diseases and work in environmental conditions,and conduct other research relating to health problems, in recognitionof the fact that <T3>occupational health standards present problems often different fromthose involved in occupational safety.'' </T3>(emphasis added). The legislative history indicates Congressional concern for reduction inhealth risk from both the recognized hazards and from the many newly utilizedchemicals. Congress stated in 1970:<ITAG tagnum="21">In the field of occupational health the view is particularly bleak,and due to the lack of information and records, may well be considerablyworse than we currently know. Occupational diseases which first commandedattention at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution are still underminingthe health of workers. Substantial numbers, even today, fall victim toancient industrial poisons such as lead and mercury. Workers in the dustytrades still contact various respiratory diseases. Other materials in industrialuse are only now being discovered to have toxic effects. In addition, technologicaladvances and new processes in American industry have brought numerous newhazards to the workplace. Carcinogenic chemicals, lasers, ultrasonic energy,beryllium metal, epoxy resins, pesticides, among others, all present incipientthreats to the health of workers. Indeed, new materials and processes arebeing introduced into industry at a much faster rate than the present meagerresources of occupational health can keep up with. It is estimated thatevery 20 minutes a new and potentially toxic chemical is introduced intoindustry. New processes and new resources of energy present occupationalhealth problems of unprecedented complexity. (Senate Report 91-1282, p.2).</ITAG>To accomplish the goal of protecting workers from occupationally relateddisease Congress created a three-pronged approach in the OSH Act. First, Congress desired that OSHA, as soon as possible after it was established,have in existence a set of basic, minimum health and safety standards.To accomplish this it provided in section 6(a) of the OSH Act that OSHAshould adopt within its first two years, without hearing or public comment,established federal standards and national consensus standards. At that time, under the Walsh-Healy Act, the Department of Labor had adoptedfor government contractors approximately 400 health standards based onthe Threshold Limit Value (TLV) recommendations of the American Conferenceof Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). Those were adopted as establishedfederal standards. In addition about 25 exposure limits had been recommendedby the American Standards Association (presently called the American NationalStandards Institute). Those were adopted as national consensus standards.OSHA adopted these initial exposure limits in May 1971. They are for themost part the maximum air contaminant levels set forth in Tables Z-1, Z-2,and Z-3 of 29 CFR 1910.1000. Congress recognized the need to update and add new standards. It createdtwo mechanisms for this purpose: Regular or ``6(b)'' standards and emergencyor ``6(c)'' standards. Congress specified the procedures for developing and promulgating regularstandards in sections 6(b)(1)-(4) and 6(f). These sections provide that:The public may petition for new standards; OSHA may set up an advisorycommittee to assist in developing a standard; and, before issuing a standard,OSHA must publish a proposal with an explanatory preamble, request publiccomments and then publish an explanatory preamble with a final standard.In addition to these general requirements of informal rulemaking, Congressspecified that OSHA must hold an oral hearing if requested and supportits determination with substantial evidence in the rulemaking record. Congress also provided in section 6(c) for the issuance of Emergency TemporaryStandards (ETS) to take immediate effect without rulemaking. However, OSHAmust then complete a section 6(b) rulemaking within 6 months. The criteriafor issuing an ETS is that ``employees are exposed to grave danger fromexposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmfulor from new hazards, and that such emergency standard is necessary to protectemployees from that danger.'' OSHA has found that section 6(c) procedureshave not generally accelerated the regulatory process. Most ETS's havebeen litigated and judicial stays have been issued either on proceduralor substantive grounds. Since the passage of the Act in 1970, OSHA has made substantial progressin improving the occupational health of workers for some priority healthhazards. Asbestos and arsenic exposures have been dramatically reduced,substantially reducing cancer risk to employees. Lead exposures have beenreduced and we are now seeing a major reduction in employee blood leadlevels, and lead related diseases. Cotton dust exposures have been reducedand byssinosis has been nearly eliminated from the textile work force.OSHA has also substantially reduced significant health risk from some ofthe newer chemicals such as ethylene oxide and vinyl chloride. Through the hazard communication and access to employee exposure and medicalrecords standards, OSHA has greatly expanded the ability of employees tolearn about and protect themselves from health hazards. OSHA's standards have proven to be feasible, often costing less than estimated.The vinyl chloride standard cost one-tenth OSHA's contractor's estimate.The cotton dust standard has been credited with improving the industry'scompetitiveness and productivity by stimulating major technology improvementswhile costing one-half OSHA's estimate. The preambles to OSHA standards have been lengthy, detailed and sophisticated.They have thoroughly analyzed health studies and controversial scientificissues about carcinogenicity and risk assessment. Extensive analyses offeasibility have been made. OSHA has issued only 24 substance-specific health regulations since itscreation. It has not been able to review the many thousands of currentlyunregulated chemicals in the workplace or to keep up with reviewing theseveral thousand new chemicals introduced since its creation. Using past approaches and practices, OSHA could continue to regulate asmall number of the high priority substances and those of greatest publicinterest. However, it would take decades to review currently used chemicalsand OSHA would never be able to keep up with the many chemicals which willbe introduced in the future. OSHA believes it is a major priority to update its existing PELs and tomake a substantial effort to control exposure to chemicals newly used inthe workplace for which no exposure limits exist. The existing health literatureand expert judgment indicate that such new or lower limits are needed toprotect against many types of deleterious health effects. These includekidney and liver diseases, respiratory diseases, reductions in lung function,nerve disorders and reduction in nerve function, carcinogenicity, irritationto the eyes, throat, skin and other organs which prevent working safely,and many other disorders and dysfunctions. As the final regulatory analysis indicates, millions of employees are exposedto levels of these chemicals which, the literature or expert opinion indicates,do or may create deleterious health effects. Clearly, it is a most importantoccupational health priority to reduce or eliminate such disease and materialimpairments of health.Congress clearly indicated that it was a major Congressional priority toconsider and control, when needed, the many thousands of unregulated chemicals,and update the existing Z-Table chemicals. For example, the previous quotationindicated Congress' concern with the thousands of newly introduced chemicals.Congress also stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">Accordingly, it is essential that such standards (Table Z chemicals)be constantly improved and replaced as new knowledge and techniques aredeveloped. In addition there are occupational harzards, particularly thoseaffecting health_which are not covered by any standards at all. (SenateReport 91-1282, p. 6.)</ITAG>Government agencies and professional organizations have also recommendedthat OSHA lower exposures for many Z-Table substances and add limits forcurrently unregulated substances. The National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health has recommended new or lower exposure limits for approximately190 chemicals (RELs) in its Recommendations for Occupational Safety andHealth Standards, Sept. 1986.The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) 1987-88Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) adopted new exposure limits for approximately164 substances not regulated by OSHA, and lower limits, short-term exposurelimits, ceiling limits or skin designations for 212 substances now regulatedby OSHA.In light of its priority to address the many unregulated health hazardsand improve the existing Z-Table limits, OSHA commenced a review processto determine the best way to achieve this goal. It reviewed its past historyand set up an internal task force to consider the matter. In addition,OSHA requested the Administrative Conference of the United States to studythe issue and make recommendations.OSHA's analysis indicated a number of reasons why the standards developmentprocess takes so long. These are discussed below. As can be seen some arewithin OSHA's control and some are not.OSHA, in the past, has determined which substances it would commence standardsdevelopment activity upon either through response to petitions or internalreviews. The time and resources spent analyzing what should be done nexthas been considerable.An exhaustive review of the literature for each substance has been completedprior to initiating rulemaking. Detailed presentations for each study andlengthy discussions of every conceivable issue have been completed.The lengthy preamble which has become a regular part of each standard islargely the result of the need for OSHA to defend its standards in suitsbrought inevitably by both industry and labor. See for example <T3>Synthetic Organic Chemical Mfgs.</T3> v. <T3>Brennan</T3>; <T3>Oil Chemical and Atomic Workers </T3>v. <T3>Brennan</T3>, 503 F.2d 1155, 506, F.2d 385 (3rd. Cir. 1974); PublicCitizen, <T3>Health Research Group et al. </T3>v. <T3>Tyson; Association of Ethylene Oxide Users </T3>v. <T3>Tyson</T3>, 796 F.2d. 1479 (D.C. Cir. 1986). OSHA feels more confidentin the successful defense of a standard if all possible issues have beenexhaustively explored.Individual standards have included a full range of ancillary provisionssuch as monitoring, medical surveillance, action levels and work practices.This increases the issues that must be studied and discussed, adding tothe time taken to complete a standard.OSHA has performed technical and economic feasibility analyses as requiredby statute. These have been made lengthier and more time consuming becausea range of possible alternative exposure limits have been explored.The regulatory process is also longer and more resource intensive becauseof analyses required either by statute or executive order. OSHA developsEnvironmental Impact Statements as required by the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act, conducts Regulatory Flexibility Analyses as required by theRegulatory Flexibility Act and conducts detailed analyses required by thePaperwork Reduction Act. All of the Presidents who have been in officeduring OSHA's existence have stressed the need to reduce inflation andimprove the cost effectiveness of regulations. Under various ExecutiveOrders (E.O. 12044, 12291, etc.) OSHA has been required to perform extensiveeconomic analyses.OSHA has also followed more extensive and elaborate administrative proceduresthan other health regulatory agencies. In addition to extensive preamblesto the proposed and final regulations, there is usually advance noticeof a proposal in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>There is a complete rulemaking docket into whichthe Agency places all the studies it relied upon. In addition to publiccomment and an oral hearing as required by law, opportunity is given forpost hearing evidence and briefs. During the hearing, questioning of witnesses,OSHA and its contractors is permitted.Consequently OSHA has permitted the public more extensive procedural opportunitiesthan its statute, the Administrative Procedures Act, or legal doctrinerequire. See the procedural rules in 29 CFR Part 1911 and <T3>International Harvester </T3>v. <T3>Rucklehaus</T3>, 478 F.2d 619 (D.C. Cir. 1973). These procedures canincrease agency knowledge and have been commended by the courts. (See <T3>Industrial Union Dept.</T3> v. <T3>Hodgson</T3> 499 F.2d 467 (D.C. Cir. 1974). However, they do mean thatif delays and continuances are granted at each stage, the length of therulemaking process is substantially extended.OSHA in its first 17 years has also had to address difficult scientificfeasibility and policy issues. These include extrapolation from animaldata to humans (ETO supra), epidemiology, risk assessment and significantrisk analysis (Arsenic, 48 FR 1864, January 14, 1983; Asbestos, 51 FR 22612,June 20 1986), feasibility for industries with aging facilities (lead,arsenic, supra), lowest feasible level (Benzene, 52 FR 34460, September11, 1987, for example and others). Naturally when considering such issuesfor the first time, an Agency desires to go through extensive reviews beforereaching final decisions.OSHA consulted with the Administrative Conference of the United States(ACUS) to determine what would be appropriate procedures to respond tothe issue of the large number of chemicals which need new exposure limits.The Conference issued two lengthy reports of a study conducted by two professorsof administrative law. After extensive consideration, the ACUS made twosets of recommendations to OSHA. Recommendation 87-1, 52 FR 23629 (1987)and 87-10, 52 FR 40147 (December 30, 1987).The Administrative Conference specifically recommended.<ITAG tagnum="21">1. Updating the 1971 Consensus Standards. The Occupational Safetyand Health Administration, as an interim step, should continue to updatethe Table Z national consensus standards adopted in 1971 if updating canbe accomplished by expedited rulemaking procedure (e.g., including moreconcise preambles) appropriate to the nature of the revised table. OSHAshould update the 1971 standards on a generic basis (i.e., include multiplestandards in one proceeding) when consensus recommendations are availablewhich are generally accepted by employers and workers in the affected industries,and when the new standards can be evaluated on the basis of risk and feasibilityinformation reasonably available to the Agency. This interim step shouldnot interfere with OSHA's continuing responsibility to promulgate and modifysafety and health standards.</ITAG>As this discussion indicates, there is a clear and generally recognizedneed to improve occupational health protection of workers from a substantialnumber of chemicals which are present in the workplace. Clearly an improvedapproach to regulation is needed to solve this problem in a reasonabletime period. OSHA's traditional approach, which has permitted on the averageless than two major health regulations per year, is not adequate to addressthe backlog of at least 400 chemicals generally recognized as needing newor lower exposure limits. OSHA has reviewed the law, Congressional intent,its history, and the recommendations of experts. Based on this review,OSHA adopted the approach described in Section IV-C which it has followedto accomplish the crucial goal of improving occupational health protectionof workers. OSHA concluded that this approach has a greater health benefitand will prevent more deaths and various deleterious health effects, thancould be achieved by allocating the same resources to comprehensive rulemakingfor a small group of substances.B. Chronology of RegulationThe public process followed by OSHA to implement this rulemaking was startedon October 26, 1987, when the Department of Labor published its SemiannualAgenda of Regulations at 52 FR 40494-40534. The entry titled ``PermissibleExposure Limit Update'' states OSHA would propose a wide scale updatingof its exposure limits. That entry scheduled March 1988 for the proposaland October 1988 for the final regulation. It also indicated that the AmericanConference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists had updated many of itsrecommended exposure limits (TLVs) since 1968. The 1968 TLVs were usedas the basis of most of OSHA's existing 6(a) exposure limits. A similarnotice was published in the next Semiannual Agenda on April 29, 1988, at53 FR 14024.OSHA published its proposal, ``Air Contaminants, Proposed Rule'' on June7, 1988, at 53 20960 (Ex. 2). That document filled 433 <T4>Federal Register </T4>pages. It considered whether exposure limitsshould be changed for 428 substances. New or lower limits were proposedfor 402 substances, one was proposed to be raised and 25 were proposedto be unchanged.That document included a 21 page discussion of the history, approach andgeneral issues. There followed 250 pages of health discussions which includedgeneral discussions by type of effect (cardiovascular, kidney/liver, etc.)and a concise individual discussion of the health effects associated withexposure to each substance. The more important or controversial substanceshad somewhat longer discussions than other substances. Each individualsubstance discussion stated the health effects, summarized the major relevantstudies, and stated the reason OSHA preliminarily concluded significantrisk did or did not exist. Finally, the complete Preliminary RegulatoryImpact, Regulatory Flexibility and Feasibility Analysis was printed running71 pages along with one of the supplements on methodology. (In this instanceone <T4>Federal Register </T4>page equaled approximately five double-spacedtyped pages.)OSHA placed in the public docket either before June 7th, or shortly thereafter,all of the studies or documents upon which it relied. This included Exs.1-1 to 1-1208, which constitute virtually all of the health studies uponwhich OSHA relied and that were discussed in the preamble (a few minorforeign studies referenced by ACGIH were not available). Also includedwere many data bases on occupational health such as the ACGIH documentation,NIOSH publications (for example, NIOSH-TIC, Ex. 7, is a 2500 page summaryof health effects organized by chemical) and exposure limits of other countries.Also placed in the Docket were 6 supplements to the Regulatory Impact andFeasibility Analysis (Exs. 4A-4F, approximately 1500 pages). Four volumesof exposure, control technology and feasibility data organized by chemicalwere placed in the record as Ex. 6 and a computer data tape for these volumeswas made available.The June 7 Proposal scheduled July 1 for notices of intent to appear atthe hearing, July 8 for the submission of comments and testimony, and July20 for the hearing to begin. It suggested August 12 for post-hearing evidenceand August 26 for post-hearing briefs.OSHA received several requests for extensions of time, some for quite extendedperiods such as 9 months. On July 1 (53 FR 24956) (Ex. 5) OSHA granteda brief extension. Comments and testimony were due July 25 and the hearingwas scheduled to commence July 28. August 19 and September 2 were recommendedrespectively for post-hearing evidence and briefs.In response to the proposal, OSHA received 1248 timely comments (Ex. 3-1to 3-1248) and 204 late comments (Ex.   L-3-1249 to L-3-1452). Approximately800 of the comments and most of the late comments were very similar lettersgenerated by trade associations interested in the regulation of grain dust,wood dust or styrene. The balance of comments ranged from short to 3000page submissions expressing views on the Proposal and including variousstudies.OSHA also received 92 Notices of Intention to Appear (Exs. 8-1 to 8-92).Approximately half of those included copies of testimony and substantiveevidence to be presented at the hearing. Established and published proceduresrequire that persons may testify for no longer than 10 minutes at the hearingwithout submitting a notice.The public comments, evidence and testimony totaled approximately 25,000pages. This included actual comments and views, and attached health andfeasibility studies. OSHA submitted to the docket in a timely fashion on July 25, 1988, statementsby the Director of Health Standards, the panel of economic witnesses, and7 other witnesses requested to testify by OSHA. NIOSH also submitted onthat date its comments, testimony and views.In addition, for the convenience of the public, NIOSH placed in the recordthe paper copy of all health studies on each substance in the rulemakingorganized by substance. This included the minor studies as well as themajor ones that OSHA had relied on and had already submitted to the record.This submission was lengthy; however, all this information was indexedin the NIOSH Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS) whichis a 5 volume bibliography of occupational health studies which NIOSH isrequired by statute to create and maintain. (Section 20(a)(6) of the OSHAct). The RTECS have been available for many years. The vast majority ofstudies NIOSH placed in the docket were publicly available either in majorlibraries or from several computer data bases. Consequently they had allbeen readily available to the public for many years. Participants testifiedthat they could be easily researched (Tr. August 4, Test. of Factor).As OSHA had expected, a review of the comments and testimony indicatesthat of 428 chemicals in the rulemaking, approximately 280 received nocomments or testimony and OSHA preliminary conclusions on risk and feasibilitywere reasonable and correct. Approximately 100 substances received onlylimited mention by one or a few participants. Approximately 40 substancesreceived substantive comments but in some of these instances OSHA's proposedPEL was not necessarily controversial. For example, the comments may havebeen directed at technical improvements. Finally, approximately ten substancesreceived substantial comments and were deemed to be controversial. Becauseof this filtering process, the rulemaking, as OSHA had anticipated, developeda narrower and more manageable form.Also, as had been OSHA's prior experience, major industry trade associationswere already formed, represented by major law firms, to express views onthe more controversial substances. For example, the Styrene Institute,which has been in existence for 12 years, submitted about 2500 pages ofcomments, studies and attachments (Ex. 3-742) and was represented by Kellerandamp; Heckman. The Carbon Disulfide Committee, which has been in existence11 years, submitted approximately 1000 pages of comments and attachments(Ex. 3-747) and was represented by Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher. The Trade Unions also made major submissions on the chemicals they wereinterested in. The Food and Allied Trades Department of the AFL-CIO submittedextensive information on grain dust (Ex. 3-751). The Amalgamated Clothingand Textile Workers Union submitted extensive information on perchloroethylene(Ex. 43). The AFL-CIO (Ex. 39), United Autoworkers (Ex. 42), Workers' Instituteof Safety and Health, United Paperworkers, Carpenters and Woodworkers,and other unions also made major submissions.The oral hearing commenced on July 28. It extended for 13 hearing dayswith an average of approximately 7 hours of actual hearing time each day.The total transcript was approximately 4000 pages. Approximately 200 witnessestestified and responded to questions. Although there were some limits onquestioning by an individual participant, the questioning in total wasextensive since there often were more than 10 participants who questioneda particular witness. It was evident that all participants had been ableto ask all the questions they wished by the end of the hearing.The OSHA Staff panel responded to questions for three-quarters of one hearingday. The OSHA economics panel responded to questions on three separateoccasions so that the public could complete questioning and have an opportunityto ask questions after having reviewed all OSHA submissions. The otherOSHA witnesses fully responded to questions as did NIOSH (Tr. August 1).NIOSH agreed to return for further questions, but participants who initiallyrequested the right to ask further questions withdrew their requests.OSHA submitted to the Docket on July 25, 1988, approximately 40 site visitreports and on August 8, 1988, approximately 40 more site visit reportswere submitted. The site visits were supplementary to the survey data andwere not the basis of OSHA's initial feasibility conclusions. The OSHAeconomics panel returned on August 15, 1988, to answer questions specificallyon those visits.OSHA's initial goal was to complete 100 site visits. However, the visitsneeded employer approval both for the visit and the subsequent report beforethe visit could be undertaken and/or the report submitted to the Docket.Consequently OSHA could not completely control the completion of the sitevisits or submission of the report to the Docket. OSHA completed severaladditional site visits, but could not complete the related reports priorto the end of the hearing. OSHA submitted those reports to the employerin order to give the employer the option of putting them in the docket.Employers in the steel industry and styrene users did submit several suchreports to the docket. Employers with grain exposures initially refusedto permit site visits. Although some later agreed to site visits, it wasby then too late to complete the visits and submit the reports to the record,so the site visits were not made.At the end of the hearing, the presiding officer indicated that, becauseof the broad scope of the hearing, post-hearing evidence should be due90 days after the close of the hearing and post-hearing briefs 120 daysafter the close of the hearing (Ex. 81). OSHA indicated both at the hearingand by letters and telephone calls to participants that a shorter periodwas required to maintain the schedule necessitated by the high priorityof the Proposal; OSHA stated that it did not think this would be unfairto participants (Exs. 60-9, 81 A). By <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice of September 7, 1988, (53 FR 34708; Ex.100), the Secretary of Labor set October 7, 1988, for post-hearing evidenceand October 31, 1988, for post-hearing briefs. (This matter is discussedmore fully in the Section III, Legal Authority.)OSHA received 57 post-hearing submissions from public participants totalingapproximately 9000 pages. OSHA also received 41 post-hearing briefs. Thetotal record includes substantially more than 4000 separate documents (individualstudies, statements, comments, etc.).The record was closed and certified by the presiding officer on November10, 1988.C. Details of Approach Used to Develop RegulationThe first step OSHA took to increase the pace of the regulatory processwas to make a determination not to analyze individual substances in orderto decide if they were of sufficient priority to be included in the project.Rather OSHA reviewed existing data bases and lists of recommended exposurelimits, and determined which of these should be the starting point forthe Proposal.OSHA concluded that the National Institute for Occupational Safety andHealth's (NIOSH) Recommended Exposure Limits (RELs) and the American Conferenceof Governmental Industrial Hygienist's (ACGIH) 1987-88 Threshold LimitValues (TLVs_a copyrighted term) provided the best two lists of substancesto be considered for regulation and to provide a starting point for individualsubstance permissible exposure limits (PELs). See the discussion at 53FR 20966-7. These lists of substances are developed by organizations ofexperts very knowledgeable both about the American work place and the healthliterature. See the testimony of Mastromatteo (Ex. 22) and NIOSH statement(Ex. 8-47). Both NIOSH and ACGIH publish documentation to support theirrecommendations and permit outside participation in the development ofexposure limits.Based on further analysis, the ACGIH TLVs were picked as the single bestlist to define the substances to be included in this rulemaking. The detailsof this OSHA analysis are provided in the Proposal (53 FR 20966-20967)and will not be repeated here. OSHA's major reason was that the TLVs aremore extensive than the RELs and more generally used. There are over 600TLVs and approximately 160 RELs.By using the ACGIH list of TLVs as the basis for the selection of substancesto be considered for this regulation, OSHA has greatly reduced the timeit would take to proceed with this rulemaking. The ACGIH's list is broadin scope, attuned to the American workplace and developed by experts withsubstantial health expertise. Therefore, OSHA concludes that this approachto determining which substances will be considered for regulation is rationaland allows OSHA to expedite the process of improving the health of Americanworkers.No changes to existing limits were considered in this rulemaking for substancescovered by limits established in substance-specific section 6(b) rulemaking(24 substances) or substances for which the process of section 6(b) rulemakinghas already been initiated (9 substances). Since OSHA had already begunthe process of detailed analysis of these substances, additional reviewwas determined to be unduly repetitive and confusing at this point.OSHA then compared the permissible exposure limits in Tables Z-1, Z-2,and Z-3 to the TLV list. If the TLV and OSHA permissible exposure limitsin the Z-Tables were identical, the substance was not considered for changeof PEL in this proposal. The basis for this approach is that there is lesslikelihood to be a need for a change in an exposure limit if an organizationwhich regularly reviews the literature has not changed its recommendation.If the TLV and the PEL differed, the substance was considered for changeof PEL in this rulemaking. Also substances for which there was a TLV, butno PEL, were included in this rulemaking. There is additional elaborationon this methodology in Section IV. D., Boundaries to Regulation.The second approach OSHA used to shorten the rulemaking process was torely to a greater extent than in the past on research and recommendationsalready made by NIOSH and ACGIH as a starting point for OSHA's analysis.Both organizations have experts undertake a complete review of the literaturefor individual substances. Then they propose recommendations and permitoutside comments on their proposed recommendations. At the next stage,each has a committee of experts again review the literature, as well asthe comments on the initially published recommendations before determiningthe recommended exposure limit.The approach OSHA followed was to first determine if the ACGIH-TLVs andNIOSH RELs were similar. If they were, or if there was no NIOSH REL, thenOSHA reviewed the ACGIH documentation and recommendation. The ACGIH documentationincludes summaries and analyses of the major studies. If the REL and TLVdiffered significantly, OSHA reviewed the studies and reasoning upon whichboth NIOSH and ACGIH recommendations were based, and then chose the recommendationwhich in OSHA's view was more appropriate.In its review OSHA determined first whether the studies and analyses werevalid and of reasonable scientific quality. Second, it determined, basedon the studies, if the published documentation of the REL or TLV wouldmeet OSHA's legal requirements for setting a PEL. Thus, OSHA reviewed thestudies to see if there was substantial evidence of significant risk atthe existing PEL or, if there was no PEL, at exposures which might existin the workplace in the absence of any limit. Third, OSHA reviewed thestudies to determine if the new PEL would lead to substantial reductionin significant risk. If this was so, and if the new PEL was feasible (seediscussion below), OSHA proposed the new PEL.OSHA then divided the chemicals into 18 categories, generally by healtheffect but, in a few instances, by other criteria. These categories includedcardiovascular, liver-kidney, respiratory and other types of diseases ormaterial health impairments. Each of these categories received an individualliterature review and discussion in the preamble analyzing the etiologyof substances which cause that health effect.Some substances have several effects; the category chosen for each substancewas based on the health effect which most influenced the exposure levelproposed. However, OSHA individual discussions and conclusions referencedand were based on all health effects associated with the specific substance.Following each general discussion in the preamble, OSHA summarized thedocumentation and provided references for each individual substance andstated the reasons for the proposed new exposure limit. OSHA also statedthe reasons why it preliminarily concluded that the proposed new limitwould substantially reduce significant risk for that substance. In thecase of 25 substances, OSHA explained why after review it did not proposea new exposure limit. In one instance OSHA indicated the reasons for proposingto raise a limit.This method fully informed the public of the basis for OSHA's decisions.The public was then in position to support or challenge OSHA's proposal,to criticize the studies upon which OSHA relied, and to supply any additionalstudies, evidence or views during the comment period, during the hearingor as post hearing submissions.OSHA is gratified by the degree of support for the proposal expressed byrulemaking commenters. For example:<ITAG tagnum="21">We believe this proposal is one of the most significant steps takenby OSHA since its inception. The time and resources required for substancespecific rulemaking have greatly limited the number of PELs that OSHA hasbeen able to revise since they were adopted in 1971. Continuing individualrulemaking would result in adding to the backlog of outdated PELs, whilethe method chosen by OSHA for this revision assures that comprehensiveupdate will be completed within a reasonable time (Tr. August 2, Testimonyof Tamarelli; SOCMA).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">CMA supports the concept of revising the Z Table PELs in order toconform with the threshold limit values, TLVs, that have been adopted orupdated by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists* * * It is hard for us to understand how anyone could say that the proceedingis too limited in scope. To the contrary, a much more valid criticism mightbe that OSHA has bitten off more than it can chew. The Agency quite reasonablyhas concluded that adjusting the permissible exposure limits for chemicalson the TLV list should be its first order of business (Tr. August 10, Testimonyof Lynch/CMA).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">OSHA has taken a truly significant step in updating and enhancingthe regulatory provisions applicable to the workplace * * * OSHA was prudentin our view to rely on the ACGIH TLVs to establish the bounds of the rulemaking(Tr. August 9, Testimony of Holthouser/RMA).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">GE strongly supports and endorses the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration's 6(b) rulemaking efforts to revise and upgrade the Z Tablesin 29 CFR 1910.1000 and encourages everyone concerned about employee health,along with those involved in the rulemaking effort, to pursue a timelyconclusion to the process (Tr. August 9, Jones/GE).</ITAG>The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), on the other hand,was entirely in favor of OSHA's use of either an ACGIH or NIOSH limit,as the case requires:<ITAG tagnum="21">AIHA supports the adoption by OSHA of NIOSH REL values as PELs ona case-by-case basis where such values are supported by the scientificevidence and are feasible from the standpoint of implementation (Ex. 8-16).</ITAG>NIOSH expressed strong support for this rulemaking in general but submittedspecific comments on a number of substances that it believes should havedifferent limits from those proposed (Ex. 8-47). NIOSH's substance-specificcomments are addressed in connection with the preamble discussion of thesesubstances in Section VI.Union representatives concurred with the need to update the Z-Tables. Forexample, M. Seminario/AFL-CIO stated: ``We are pleased that OSHA and manyindustry representatives have acknowledged finally that the current permissibleexposure limits do not protect workers, and we do indeed support regulatoryaction to update the standards for toxic substances through the use ofboard-based rulemaking such as the Agency has proposed here. (Tr. August4, Testimony of Seminario/ AFL-CIO).   However, Ms. Seminario did not agree with the approach that OSHA followedstating that ``it does not provide the workers with the kind of protectionthat the OSHA Act requires.'' Union representatives stated that the proposedstandard was not adequate since it did not cover some substances of concernand did not include the ancillary provisions which they felt were important.OSHA does not agree with this judgment. It is impossible to cover all substances,and OSHA has made a rational and reasonable judgment regarding the boundsof this standard which is supported by most industry and professional associations.OSHA is approaching the subject of ancillary provisions through separategeneric rulemakings which have already been initiated. The basis of thesejudgments are discussed in detail in other parts of this preamble.OSHA stated in the proposal that it would consider all the additional viewsand studies presented by participants. Based on what was best supportedby the entire record, OSHA would issue as the final standard either thePEL it had proposed, make no change to the existing PEL, or issue a differentPEL. OSHA has followed this method of analysis in issuing the final rule.OSHA's approach has indeed made it possible to increase the efficiencyof the regulatory process and issue new and revised PELs to protect thehealth of workers from a large number of substances which were unregulated,or for which existing exposure limits are out of date. It has also permittedOSHA to rely on the best available scientific information and its pastexperience, while giving the public both excellent notice and a full andfair opportunity to comment, submit additional studies and make recommendations.The improved efficiency of this rulemaking effort has not come from sacrificingscientific validity. It has resulted from combining discussions by healtheffect, concentrating on major issues and studies, using as a startingpoint the research of expert organizations, and using public comments tobring to attention additional relevant studies and issues. OSHA has addressedin more detail those substances, issues and studies which have been identifiedin the comments as the most controversial.In addition, OSHA has increased the efficiency of its feasibility analysis.Its prior substance-by-substance, industry sector by industry sector, process-by-processapproach would have resulted in a vast body of duplicative informationin a multi-substance rulemaking. In addition, it would have made it impossibleto update very many substances in a reasonable period because of the timeand resources required.OSHA followed several approaches to increase the efficiency of its feasibilityanalysis process. First, it made maximum use of existing information. OSHA'sIntegrated Management Information System (IMIS) is probably the largestsource of accurate exposure date in the world. It has 77,000 exposure measurements,is organized by industry and process, includes judgments by complianceofficers who are experts in industrial hygiene, includes the number ofworkers represented by each measurement, and is computer readable.OSHA also used the two National Occupational Hazard Surveys (NOHS) by NIOSH.These are good sources of the number of workers potentially exposed tosubstances in each industry segment. OSHA also analyzed the large volumeof data in various publicly available data bases on control technologyfor various substances, processes and industries. For the convenience ofthe public, much of these data were combined into four volumes which weremade available to the public in the docket. OSHA also stated it would supplythese data on computer tape if requested.OSHA had these data reviewed by approximately twenty experts in industrialhygiene and industrial engineering. They made estimates of substances likelyto be used and processes likely to be present in each industry sector coveredby this regulation. These estimates were used as starting points. Muchmore extensive information was gathered in a nationwide survey of 5700firms.These experts also made estimates of the cost to reduce exposure basedon scale of operation, type of process, and degree of exposure reductionneeded. Standard source materials such as industrial manuals were used.Many processes are relatively standardized throughout industry and areused for a variety of substances. For example, vat mixing takes place formany substances in many industries. It can be uncontrolled without a coverand involve manual loading of dry chemicals. It can be partially controlledwith covers and pump-loading of liquids. It can be fully controlled withenclosure, ventilation and automated loading and unloading. Likely exposurescan be estimated by determining the amount of chemicals used and degreeof existing controls. Costs can be generalized throughout much of industryfrom the size of the operation, estimated exposures, and the cost to gofrom one degree of control to the improved level of control needed to achievethe proposed reduction in exposures.With this method of analysis, it is possible to make estimates of exposures,controls necessary, exposure levels which can be achieved and costs fromdata on substances and processes present and numbers of operations foreach industry segment. This information is sufficient for determining technicalfeasibility and costs by industry segment. These data combined with publiclyavailable sales and profit ratio data make it possible to estimate economicfeasibility by industry segment.To gather data on the substances present, types of processes, number ofprocesses, and controls in place by industry segment, OSHA commissionedthe largest survey it has ever conducted. Over 5700 questionnaires wereadministered throughout the covered industry segment based on statisticallyvalid sampling techniques. A vast amount of information was received onsubstances present, processes used and controls in place.OSHA concludes that this approach is accurate on an industry sector byindustry sector basis for individual processes.Overall, OSHA has a high degree of confidence that its estimates of technicalfeasibility, costs and economic feasibility are accurate. OSHA has hadfar more data available to it than it normally does in a single substancerulemaking. The data were gathered systematically and were combined usinga methodology that was statistically valid and devised by persons withgreat expertise.In addition, to increase the efficiency of the process, OSHA analyzed thefeasibility of the specific proposed exposure level for each substancerather than considering a variety of different exposure levels.To permit public comment on this approach and related data in an efficientmanner, OSHA published the entire Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysiswith the Proposal in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. In addition, it was made available to the publicin the docket at the time of publication six supplements which describedin great detail the methodology and results of the survey by sector.OSHA concludes that it provides the public with all the information participantswould need to comment on, criticize or support OSHA's feasibility conclusions.However, some participants requested more detailed analysis of their sectors.Although OSHA indicated that it believed the date it had made availablewere sufficient for these purposes, it did where possible supply additionaldata and make special computer runs when requested by the participants.OSHA also stated it would consider all additional feasibility data submittedby the public. Many participants did supply additional data. OSHA has reviewedall data in the record in reaching its final feasibility conclusions.OSHA concludes that the approach it took developed good feasibility data,permitted participants a reasonable opportunity to review OSHA's data andsupply their own, and was necessary to make the feasibility analysis processmore efficient.The fourth difference in approach from single substance rulemaking wasOSHA's decision to limit this rulemaking to the issue of exposure limits.OSHA has not considered medical surveillance, exposure monitoring, industrialhygiene requirements and other ancillary provisions which were not includedin the existing 6(a) standard.As stated in the Preamble, OSHA has concluded that the highest priorityfor protecting occupational health is to lower exposure limits for manysubstances where current knowledge indicates they are too high, or wherecurrently there are no limits but recent scientific knowledge indicateslimits are needed. This priority could not be achieved if ancillary provisionswere considered at the same time. As discussed in Section III, Legal Authority,OSHA believes it is a rational use of its priority setting power to considerancillary provisions subsequently either in other generic rulemakings orin substance specific section 6(b) rulemakings. It has already begun thatprocess as discussed there. In any event, OSHA's approach significantlyimproves occupational health protection.A final method OSHA has followed to make this rulemaking more manageableis to rely on its experience. OSHA has now made feasibility determinationsfor several dozen substances and significant risk determinations approximatelyone dozen times. Various issues regarding the analysis of data have beenreviewed many times. OSHA's approaches have been reviewed by the courtsand upheld or modified to meet judicial guidance. OSHA has not revisitedall of the issues in quite the depth it has given them in the past in lightof its experience. Of course, determinations and conclusions required bylaw have been fully analyzed and supported. OSHA concludes it is both rationalto rely on its past experience and specifically permitted by section 6(b)(5)of the Act.In the most important areas OSHA has not made any attempt to make the regulatoryprocess shorter. First, as discussed, it included individual substance-by-substancehealth analyses and significant risk determinations. Second, it has madefeasibility determinations on the impact of the regulation of all the substancesfor each industrial sector.Third, OSHA has followed its traditional elaborate rulemaking process.Nine months, advance notice of the intent to issue a proposal was given.The Proposal explained OSHA's reasoning at great length by citing and discussingthe evidence upon which OSHA relied. All the studies and analyses uponwhich OSHA relied were made available in the docket. More than the minimumperiod was allowed for comments.Thirteen days were allowed for oral hearings. Testimony and evidence wasrequired to be submitted in advance and the testimony of OSHA, its economiccontractors and witnesses was made available in advance. Participants inthe hearings were permitted to question the OSHA panel, contractors, witnessesand each other. Though the questioning permitted for each participant wasnot unlimited, time was provided at the end to ensure that each participanthad completed all questioning he or she desired. As there were frequentlymore than 10 participants who questioned a single witness, the total amountof questioning was often extensive. The OSHA panel was questioned for approximatelyfour hours and the economics panel for more than six hours. Various arrangementswere made to bring back witnesses.After the hearing, participants were allowed to file post-hearing evidenceto respond to comments and testimony, and to supply materials which theycould not submit by the deadline for comments. An additional period wasallowed for post-hearing briefs.These are far more than the minimum procedural requirements of informationrulemaking or hybrid rulemaking. Few if any agencies, for example, permitquestioning of the agency and its contractors. The process also effectivelypermits participants a double round of comments.The various time frames were shorter than some participants desired. However,there was approximately one year between initial notice and final opportunityfor submissions and approximately five months from proposal to post-hearingbriefs. Not only is this far more than the legal minimum, but it shouldhave been ample to give sufficient time for participants to effectivelypresent their views and supporting evidence.Adhering to a schedule is crucial for an agency to accomplish a high priority,large scale project in a reasonable period of time. Among other reasonsfor this is the fact that extra staff must be borrowed and contractor assistancearranged. Both groups have other schedule commitments. If a rulemakingis delayed too long these resources become lost to the project. Moreover,medium length delays during the public participation period become verylengthy delays of a final rule. As OSHA has pointed out, the benefits ofthis standard to worker health are so significant that lengthy delays ofthe final rule would result in a major loss in health protection.Finally, OSHA has fully met the requirements pursuant to statute and executiveorder to perform required analyses. OSHA has completed the Regulatory Impact,Regulatory Flexibility and other analyses as required.D. Boundaries to RegulationThe Proposal defined the substances covered by this rulemaking as a sub-setof the substances listed in the 1987-88 Threshold Limit Values (TLV) publishedby the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH)(53 FR 20964-20966). OSHA pointed out in the Proposal that the TLV listinghad several advantages over other possible lists that might be used forthis purpose. Details of the OSHA analysis leading to this decision arenoted in the Proposal (53 FR 20966-20967). The primary considerations leadingto that OSHA decision were (1) number of substances covered by the TLVlisting; (2) available written documentation for the TLVs; (3) potentialemployee exposures covered by TLVs; and (4) general acceptance of the TLVsby health professionals.OSHA realized that there are different valid approaches to the questionof identifying the boundaries for this type of rulemaking, and any decisionmust balance completeness with practicality. Several commenters recommendedthat the number of substances considered in this rulemaking be expandedto include: (1) Other lists; (2) the 160 substances in the existing Z-Tableswhich were not discussed in the Proposal since their current TLVs wereidentical with the existing OSHA PEL; and (3) substances which are in theprocess of active (6b) rulemaking.Relative to the first point, the additional lists suggested included thefollowing data bases: (a) Recommended Exposure Limits (REL) developed bythe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; (b) WorkplaceEnvironmental Exposure Limits (WEEL's) developed by the American IndustrialHygiene Association; (c) EPA's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS);(d) standards used by government agencies in the U.S.S.R. and other partsof eastern and western Europe; and (e) internal company limits. The followingcomments focus on this aspect: Ex. 8-47 (NIOSH), Ex. 43 (Frumin), Ex. 194(AFL-CIO), Ex. 3-9 and Ex. 46 (Ziem), Ex. 42 C and 197 (UAW). Dr. PhillipJ. Landrigan suggested (TR August 1, Test. of Landrigan): (a) Using a singlealternative listing instead of the TLVs; (b) combining several lists todefine the bounds of this rulemaking; or (c) adopting a smaller sub-setof the TLVs.During the public hearing it was suggested that benefits would result fromdeveloping PELs for additional substances. Specific substances suggestedfor inclusion in this rulemaking included dimethylformamide (Ex. 47); polychlorinatedbiphenyls (Tr 7-123); and glycol ethers (Ex. 3-639).OSHA considered these constructive suggestions intended to expand the scopeof this rulemaking in an effort to improve the level of health protectionafforded workers. OSHA realizes that there are various approaches to thistype of rulemaking and believes that, while some of these suggestions havemerit, they introduce untenable problems at this stage of the rulemakingprocess. OSHA has determined that it is preferable to consider some ofthese suggestions as part of possible follow-on rulemaking based on thefollowing facts and analyses.For many of the additional substances provided by these data bases thereare no quantitative exposure limits (e.g. IRIS and some NIOSH RELs). Forother substances it is not clear that the limits are actually applied toworkplace compliance situations (e.g. U.S.S.R. and eastern Europe limit).For others, (internal corporate limits) an extended independent reviewprocedure is not defined. Use of a multiplicity of data bases to definethe bounds for this already large rulemaking would overwhelm the resourcesof OSHA and those concerned parties who wish to comment on any proposedchanges. This would greatly delay prompt implementation of a regulationwhich is urgently needed to protect the health of approximately 17 millionworkers who are potentially exposed to the 428 substances for which revisedPELs were considered in the Proposal. Additional delay would be necessarysince OSHA would be required to public a new Proposal to include any substancesnot identified and discussed in the Proposal.The record clearly shows that OSHA's decision to use the ACGIH TLVs asthe bounds for this effort was generally supported by most commenters fora variety of reasons: Ex. 3-866 (ORC); Ex. 3-740 (ARCO); Ex. 3-741 and196 (Dow); Ex. 170 (GE); Ex. 3-891 and 176 (SOCMA); Ex. 178 (API); Ex.3-877 and 47 (RMA); Ex. 52 (HIMA) Ex. 3-678 and 58 (Abbott); Ex. 163 (ErgonRefining), Ex. 186 (Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance) and Ex. 165(CMA). These reasons include the general acceptance and probable feasibilityof the TLVs, and the need to have clearly defined limits for this rulemakingso it can be concluded in a reasonable time period.For example, Jeremiah Lynch speaking on behalf of CMA stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">It is hard for us to understand how anyone could say the proceedingis too limited in scope * * *. The Agency quite reasonably has concludedthat adjusting the permissible exposure limits for chemicals on the TLVlist should be its first order of business. Further refinements in theregulation of these chemicals can be dealt with at a later date, to theextent additional requirements are found to be necessary. (Ex. 64).</ITAG>It is necessary to limit the number of substances included in this rulemakingso that it can be completed in a reasonable time frame. The total numberof chemicals in existence is well over 100,000. The 1985-86 edition ofthe NIOSH Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS; DHHS(NIOSH) Publication No. 87-114) contains 88,693 prime chemical substances.It is impossible to promulgate an OSHA regulation without limiting thenumber of substances under consideration to manageable proportions. Inthis regulation such limitations are based on several considerations includingthe: (1) Extent of use in commerce; (2) potential for exposure; and (3)lack of any existing protective limits. The first two criteria are bestsatisfied by using the well established TLVs as the data base for defininginclusion in this rulemaking. Since the number of substances in the TLVlisting would still overwhelm the available resources, OSHA determinedthat it was reasonable to defer for consideration at a later time those160 substances for which an OSHA PEL already exists and for which no changein TLV has occurred.Such exclusion from consideration of change of PEL in this rulemaking doesnot preclude OSHA from initiating 6(b) rulemaking in the future for anyof these substances or for any of the other substances covered by thisregulation. Because of this fact, OSHA believes that its initial decisionnot to consider changing the PEL for those substances where the 1987-88TLV is identical with the existing OSHA PEL is appropriate.OSHA also believes that it would unnecessarily complicate this rulemakingas well as the individual rulemakings if changes to existing PELs wereconsidered at this time for the nine substances for which the 6(b) rulemakingprocess has already been started. The process of developing a 6(b) standardfor a single substance differs from the process used in this proceedingsince it involves consideration of various ancillary requirements (exposuremonitoring, medical surveillance, use of personal protective equipment,labeling, etc.) which are not part of this rulemaking. Extensive docketshave already been developed for the nine substances in this category (TableIV-D-1). Since these 6(b) rulemakings should be completed in the near futureas tentatively scheduled by the Regulatory Agenda (52 FR 40494-40542),it would unnecessarily complicate the rulemaking process without any significantbenefit if these nine substances were included in this rulemaking.Until the new regulations for these nine substances are adopted, the existingOSHA PELs will remain in effect as reflected in Table Z-1-A. This sameprocedure is also used for the 160 substances where the existing PEL isidentical with the 1987-88 TLV, and for which new PELs are not proposedin this rulemaking. These 160 substances were listed in Table VII-D ofthe Proposal (53 FR 21254-21261).It should be noted that no changes in PEL have been proposed for the 24substances listed in Table VI-D-2 which are covered by individual 6(b)regulations. The existing PELs for some of these substances are incorporatedinto the Z-1-A Table both for reference purposes and because the individual6(b) regulations for some of these substances do not cover all operations,making maintenance of these PELs necessary to provide protection to workersinvolved in these exempted activities (e.g. benzene, cotton dust, and formaldehyde).While the TLVs and RELs were used as a starting point for defining PELs,it should be noted that OSHA made its own determination regarding eachindividual limit. This was based on further evaluation of: (a) The TLVDocumentation and the Criteria Document supporting development of the REL;(b) submissions to the public hearing record; and (c) information usedin developing some of the other data bases initially considered by OSHAin developing the Proposal.For a few substances, commenters suggested that it would be preferableto delete a particular substance from this rulemaking and consider it aspart of a separate single substance rulemaking. Such comments were specificallydirected at wood dust (Ex. 3-748), grain dust (Ex. 3-752 and 3-755), sulfurdioxide (Ex. 8-65), and styrene (Ex. 3-742).In the case of wood dust and grain dust it is imperative that OSHA actpromptly since there is no existing accepted PEL for organic dusts. TheOccupational Safety and Health Review Commission has held that the standardfor nuisance dusts is <T3>not</T3> to be applicable to wood dust and grain dust. To initiateand complete a 6(b) standard to control these substances would take considerabletime. Since there is a clear need for a PEL to protect against the significantrisk associated with exposures to wood dust and grain dust, and there isnow sufficient health and feasibility data to justify setting a PEL, itis imperative that OSHA act promptly to protect workers exposed to thesehazardous substances. The analyses of these data are provided in the discussionof these substances in Section VI. In the case of wood dust, the Inter-IndustryWood Coordinating Committee indicated their concurrence regarding adoptionof a 5 mg/m\3\ standard, which represents part of the standard OSHA isproposing for wood dust. (Ex. 3-748 and 80).In the case of sulfur dioxide, the commenter indicated that deletion wasappropriate due to the existence of a past record (Ex. 8-65 and DocketNo. H-039). OSHA agrees that the past public record must be considered,and has incorporated the previous SO<T2>2</T2> record into the record for this rulemaking (Ex. 10-45). OSHAhas carefully considered all relevant information from the previous SO<T2>2</T2> record in making its decision regarding a PEL for sulfur dioxide,and the OSHA analysis of that record is included in the discussion establishingthe PEL for sulfur dioxide.In the case of styrene, acrylamide, and a few other substances, questionswere raised regarding the adequacy of available information to developa PEL in this rulemaking. Questions were raised regarding definition ofcarcinogenicity, feasibility (economic and technological), proper classificationsof health effects, and the proper PEL (Ex. 3-742 and 70). In some instances,OSHA believes that sufficient information was not available to reach afinal determination regarding carcinogenicity. However, information submittedby the commenters, together with material considered in the developmentof the Proposal, was adequate to permit OSHA to reach a conclusion regardingthe PEL. The details of these analyses are included in Section VI.In some instances OSHA has specifically indicated that a specific revisedPEL may not fully eliminate significant risk of material impairment. Inmany instances this is due to information and data limitations noted inthe discussion for that specific substance. However, the PEL is based onthe best current interpretation of data available at the time of promulgationof the regulation. A PEL may change as more information becomes available,or more accurate analytical procedures are developed. As an example, thePEL for asbestos initially adopted in 1971 was revised in 1972. This levelwas modified in 1976 and revised again in 1986.After due consideration of all suggestions to delete substances from thisrulemaking, OSHA has determined that the only substance to be deleted fromthis rulemaking is chromyl chloride for which a PEL was considered butnot adopted because OSHA had not given adequate notice in the Proposal.In the case of three other substances (asphalt, fibrous glass and mineralwool), a decision regarding a specific PEL is being delayed. OSHA has discussedthe reasons for adopting each PEL in Section VI of the preamble to thisstandard.As part of the public hearing submissions and presentations, several individualssuggested expansion of the rulemaking to include provisions for exposuremonitoring and medical surveillance; Ex. 8-3 (Landrigan); Ex. 194 (AFL-CIO);Ex. 3-751 (Food andamp; Allied Service Trades Dept.); (Ex. 42 and 197 (UAW);Ex. 43 (Frumin); Ex. 8-61 (Workers Institute); and 8-85 (Melius). OSHAhas adopted ancillary provisions for each substance regulated through 6(b)rulemaking. After 17 years, these provisions are included in only the 24existing individual substance OSHA standards. OSHA finds that this rulemakingis not the appropriate mechanism for extending the ancillary provisionsto all substances covered by the Z-Tables and agrees with the followingcomments of PPG and Dow:<ITAG tagnum="21">Further expansion of this rule to specifically impose additional regulatoryrequirements such as medical surveillance, recordkeeping, personal protectiveequipment, and training would unnecessarily complicate and confuse themain objective of this proposal rule. There is also a greater likelihoodof challenge that has been an impediment to previous attempts to reviseair contaminant levels such as the Standards Completion Progress Project.Ex. 3-1158 (PPG)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While we believe OSHA should not adopt medical surveillance and exposuremonitoring provisions in this rulemaking, we do believe OSHA should promulgategeneric medical surveillance and exposure monitoring standards in a timelyfashion. Ex. 169 (Dow)</ITAG>On September 27, 1988, OSHA published Advance Notices of Proposal Rulemaking(ANPRM) covering ``Generic Standards for Exposure Monitoring'' (53 FR 32591-32595)and ``Medical Surveillance Programs for Employees'' (53 FR 32595-32598).It was pointed out by Dr. I. Rosenthal, Rohm and Haas Co., that ``if inthe future OSHA supplements up-to-date exposure standards with generichow-to standards addressing medical surveillance, monitoring, personalprotective equipment and other similar items the Agency will have establishedover 400 defacto complete standards.'' (Ex. Tr. 3-17). OSHA therefore believesthat consideration of exposure monitoring and medical surveillance is bestachieved through the generic approach which has been initiated with thetwo September 27, 1988, ANPRM's.The legal and policy justification for limiting this rulemaking to developmentof PELs is detailed in the Legal Authority Section of this Preamble. Theappropriateness of addressing PELs prior to considering ancillary provisionswas also endorsed on technical grounds by Dr. Marcus Key, former Directorof NIOSH (Ex.- TR 1-233, TR 1-265; TR 1-266).Several commenters were concerned with the computational formula presentlynoted in andSection; 1910.1000(d)(2), for example, Ex. 3-742 (SIRC); Ex.3-877 (RMA) and Ex. 165 (CMA). These concerns relate to the lack of a requirementthat this formula should apply only to those situations in which an additiveeffect is present. In contrast, the ACGIH discussion of the Threshold LimitValue for Mixtures (TLV and BEI for 1988-89, p. 42) states that this equationis applicable, ``when two or more hazardous substances, which act uponthe same organ system, are present, their combined effect, rather thanthat of either individually, should be given primary consideration.'' Thisreference goes on to state that ``exceptions to the above rule may be madewhen there is a good reason to believe that the chief effects of the differentharmful substances are not in fact additive, but independent as when purelylocal effects on different organs of the body are produced by the variouscomponents of the mixture.''The Proposal only redesignated paragraph andSection; 1910.1000(d) as andSection;1910.1000(f)(53 FR 21263), a change which is no longer necessary. There was no intentto reconsider or clarify this paragraph as part of this rulemaking. Thissubject was not discussed in the Proposal and was <T3>not</T3> a topic for consideration as part of this rulemaking. Therefore,it is not appropriate to consider any changes to the mixture equation atthis time.During the Public Hearing a few commenters made specific suggestions regardingother expansions to the subjects covered under this rulemaking. These included:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Expansion of the PELs to non-traditional work shifts (TR 3-231,3-234 (Arco)). OSHA is aware that work schedules in excess of 8 hrs/dayare becoming more common. However, it is clear that this rulemaking didnot provide an appropriate platform for full discussion of the technicalproblems associated with adjusting PELs for work shifts other than an 8hr/day. It appears that such a question is highly substance specific dependingon the toxicology and body clearance mechanisms, and the significance ofshort term exposure peaks. As such it may be more appropriate to provideguidance in the form of an interpretation of acceptable alternate approachesto extrapolating the 8 hr. PEL to other work shift periods. This mightbe developed through the OSHA Industrial Hygiene Technical Manual or theField Operations Manual so it could be implemented on a case-by-case basis.OSHA believes that this type of expansion of a Proposal intended to addressonly PELs is not justified. The use of PELs developed using a 10 hr. definitionfor developing 8 hr TWA PELs is supported by NIOSH testimony (Ex. 8-47)and this approach has been used in this rulemaking.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Representatives of the Workers Institute for Health and Safetysuggested incorporating surface contaminated limits, such as those recommendedby NIOSH and EPA for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) that are used in theclean-up of the New Mexico State Highway Department Building (TR 7-123and 7-124). Clearly this represents an exposure index which is significantlydifferent from ``Air Contaminants'' which is the subject of this Proposal.OSHA therefore concludes that extension of this rulemaking to include considerationof surface contamination limits is not appropriate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Mr. Richard Henderson representing the Chlorine Institute recommendedthat, rather than reducing the PEL for mercury, OSHA maintain the existingPEL and develop a comprehensive standard which includes a requirement forperiodic urinary mercury determination. The question of the appropriatePEL for mercury is discussed in Section VI of this preamble. Regardingthe suggestion of urinary measurements which could be considered for manysubstances other than mercury, OSHA finds that this represents an exposureindex which is significantly different from ``Air Contaminants'', the subjectof this rulemaking. OSHA concludes that extension of this rulemaking tocover this subject is not appropriate.</ITAG>In summary, OSHA has reviewed all comments to the record which might resultin changes to the boundaries of the rulemaking defined in the Proposal.OSHA finds that the suggested additions and deletions would not be appropriatein light of the objectives for this rulemaking established by OSHA anddictated by the statutory requirements of the OSH Act.Therefore, OSHA concluded that the 428 substances listed in Table I-E ofthe Proposal (53 FR 20968-20976) should be considered for change in thePEL as part of this regulation. These substances are listed in the Index-LocatorSection (II) of this preamble.The Z-1-A Table in this regulation also incorporates the existing PELsfor: (1) The 160 substances from the existing Z-Tables, which were notconsidered for changes in the PEL; (2) 9 substances for which 6(b) rulemakingis in progress; and (3) some of the 24 substances covered by individualOSHA standards where some sectors are not covered by the individual substancestandard.The Z-1-A Table lists all substances covered by this regulation, whetheror not the PEL has been changed, whether or not a 6(b) standard has beenundertaken on a specific substance, and whether or not a 6(b) standardcovers the substance either fully or partially. In the case of substancesregulated by individual substance OSHA standards, the Z-1-A Table crossreferences the individual standard.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M003</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">insert illustration (s) O 132-134</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>E. Special Considerations In the Proposal several substances were identified (53 FR 20978, TablesI-F-A, I-F-B, I-F-C and I-F-D) as requiring special attention. This wasdue to the presence of ``significant differences'' between the exposurelimits recommended by the various data bases initially considered in thisrulemaking. This same Section of the Proposal also identified some basicassumptions used to initially simplify the definition of ``significantdifference.'' The objective of this effort was to encourage comments duringthe Public Hearing process for those substances where there was greaterpotential for uncertainly regarding the proposed PEL. Comments were received on some of these substances. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) commentedon all those substances for which a REL existed, as well as for many othersubstances noted in these four Tables. Extensive comments were submittedregarding the proposed PELs for Acetone (Ex. 8-54, 3-69, 3-661, 3-741,Tr. VI pp. 89-247); Acrylamide (Ex. 3-961); Carbon disulfide (Ex. 8-19,8-45, 3-659, 3-674, 3-897, 3-945, 3-1158, 3-753); and Sulfur dioxide (Ex.3-1123, 8-22, 8-57, 8-65, 3-349, 8-9). A considerable number of commentswere also directed at the selection of RELs (SOCMA, Exs. 3-891 and 176;Dow Chemical, Ex. 3-741; Rubber Manufacturers, Ex. 3-877). For example,GE (Ex. 170) stated: <ITAG tagnum="21">It is apparent from the testimony given during the hearings and commentssubmitted into the rulemaking record that the Recommended Exposure Limits(RELs) are a source of considerable controversy * * * a wide cross-sectionof occupational health professionals from industry, government and academiabelieve there are substantial flaws in the the contract process under whichNIOSH RELs were developed, including limitations in peer reviews, feasibilityconsiderations, and the methodologies employed in the extrapolating animaltoxicological data and limited epidemiology findings to workplace exposurelimits. (Ex. 170) </ITAG>NIOSH pointed out that ``Each Criteria Document is reviewed by expertsrepresenting affected industries, organized labor, and trade or professionalorganizations, and by scientists, physicians, and other health professionalswith related experience in academia, government, or industry. The numberof these external peer reviewers normally is greater than 10 and oftenexceeds twice that number. In addition to the invaluable contribution theircomments make to the completed Criteria Document, OSHA receives, alongwith the completed Criteria Document, the full text of each reviewer'swritten comments accompanied by itemized annotations indicating how thedraft was modified in response, or providing the rationale if the commentor recommendation was not adopted. Each Criteria Document contains an extensivesummary in which the basis for the Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) iscarefully developed with clear and explicit citation of the data reliedupon at all steps of the logical development. No other source of exposurelimits approximates the comprehensiveness of these documents'' OSHA believesthat its use of the RELs in this rulemaking is appropriate. These submissions achieved the OSHA objectives of stimulating the inputof new data, analyses, and information to assist OSHA in this rulemakingbased on the full record for each individual substance. The discussionand application of this information to set specific PELs is included inthe individual substances discussions in Section VI of this Preamble. While OSHA did initially identify basic assumptions regarding significantdifferences (53 FR 20977), the final OSHA decision regarding selectionof a specific PEL is based on a case-by-case assessment of the health effects,significant risk, material impairment of health, available sampling andanalytical methods, and technological and economic feasibility considerations.Another special consideration was the question of dealing with substancesfor which there are sampling and analytical limitations (Table I-F-E ofthe Proposal, (53 FR 20978)). This was also identified as a concern inQuestion 9 of the Proposal (53 FR 20961). The responses to this questionare detailed in Section V of this Preamble. OSHA concurs that adequatesampling and analytical methods are required to permit enforcement of aPEL. However, OSHA believes that an adequate sampling and analytical methodexists when such methods are fully described in the open literature, orwhen otherwise readily available. The Public Hearing did not provide much additional information regardingsampling and analytical methods for those substances identified as havinginadequate sampling and analytical methods. However, a method was identifiedfor substilisins and was entered into the docket (Ex. 8-70). Included inTable IV-E-1 of this section are the substances noted in Table I-F-E ofthe Proposal (53 FR 20978) and two additional substances (oxygen difluorideand phenylphosphine) which were inadvertently omitted from the listingof substances with inadequate sampling or analytical methods along withone substance, cyanamide, which was erroneously listed as having no method.OSHA has also considered the concerns identified regarding the need fora more extensively tested analytical method (Ex. 3-960; Ex. 8-47) for enforcementpurposes. OSHA believes that enforcement can be initiated without suchdetailed methods. The OSHA docket includes: (1) Reference to a fully developedand extensively tested OSHA or NIOSH sampling and analytical procedureor, (2) a description of an OSHA in-house sampling and analytical methodfor all but the seven substances listed in Table IV-E-1. OSHA thereforebelieves there will be no problems with enforcement of the PELs for allbut these seven substances. This is consistent with conclusions of NIOSHregarding implementation (Ex. 8-47). Since development of sampling andanalytical procedures is a dynamic, rapidly progressing technology, OSHAalso believes it is appropriate to adopt PELs for the seven substances(based on the Proposal and the Public Hearing record), but stay enforcementof these PELs until adequate sampling and analytical methods are available.At such time, OSHA will publish in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>its determination that such methods exist (togetherwith a copy of the method), and indicate the proposed effective date forenforcement of the PEL for the substance in question. As time, resources and priorities permit, OSHA will attempt to initiatea program, in conjunction with NIOSH, to develop more extensively testedsampling and analytical methods for those substances where only in-housemethods are noted in the Proposal. OSHA further considered the three alternative approaches described in theProposal regarding interim procedures for handling those substances requiringspecial attention (53 FR 20978-20979). OSHA encouraged public comment onthis subject by including a question (number 14) in the Proposal. The responsesto this question are detailed in Section V of this preamble and indicatethe desireability of implementing new PELs promptly, even if they representonly interim values. Therefore, OSHA is proceeding to promulgate limits for all of the substancesincluded in the Proposal where statutory requirements are met, while alsoindentifying some substances which appear appropriate for future consideration.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0-140</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>F. Construction, Maritime and Agriculture Segments Currently the exposure limits which apply to construction are the ACGIHThreshold Limit Values of Air Contaminants for 1970 and certain substancespecific section 6(b) standards. See 29 CFR 1926.55, 58 and 29 CFR 1910.19.OSHA is required to consult with the Advisory Committee on ConstructionSafety and Health prior to proposing new standards that have a major impacton construction. See 29 CFR 1911.10(a). OSHA is in the process of formallyconsulting with the Construction Advisory Committee. After receiving theirrecommendations and studying feasibility issues for construction, OSHAintends to propose amendments covering exposures to toxic substances inconstruction reflecting the facts in this final preamble and standard,and the views of the Construction Advisory Committee. Parts 1916, 1917 and 1918 of 29 CFR cover, respectively, employment inshipyards, marine terminals and longshoring. Part 1916 for shipyards referencesthe 1970 TLVs, of the ACGIH. See 29 CFR 1915.5 and 1915.12(b)(3). Part1917 for marine terminals references the current Z-Tables. See 29 CFR 1917.2(p),and 1917.23. Part 1918 for longshoring refers to ``dangerous gaseous contaminantsnot immediately dangerous to life'' and ``heavy concentrations of dusts.''See 29 CFR 1918.93 (e) and (f). Certain substance specific section 6(b)standards also cover these industries. See 29 CFR 1910.19.OSHA, as part of the rulemaking covering construction and after studyingfeasibility for the maritime sectors, intends to consider applying thefinal standard to the maritime sectors. Subpart Z of 29 CFR Part 1910, and the included Z-Tables specifically donot apply to Agriculture. See 29 CFR 1928.21(b). In addition, many of thechemicals which affect agriculture are pesticides regulated by the EPAover which OSHA may not have jurisdiction, pursuant to section 4(b)(1)of the OSHA Act. In the future OSHA will consider, based on relevance,priorities and administrative resources, whether or not it is appropriateto consider coverage for agriculture. G. FederalismThis final regulation has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987) regarding Federalism. Executive Order12612 requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limitingstate policy options, consult with states prior to taking any actions thatwould restrict state policy options, and take such actions only when thereis clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of nationalscope. The Executive Order provides for preemption of state law only ifthere is a clear Congressional intent for the Agency to do so. Any suchpreemption is to be limited to the extent possible. During the development of this rule, OSHA has, to the extent possible,refrained from limiting state policy options by developing a rule thatpermits flexibility on the part of the States through the use of performancelanguage. OSHA also consulted with the States during the public commentand hearing period announced in the notice of proposed rulemaking for thisrule. OSHA specifically invited Stephen Cant of the State of Washingtonto testify about the state's experience in a similar rulemaking. OSH willcontinue to work with the States that have occupational safety and healthplans approved under section 18 of the OSH Act to encourage those statesto develop their own policies to achieve program objectives and will continueto work with appropriate state officials as they present their state standardsfor approval. Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), permitsany state to develop its own independent state occupational safety andhealth program that provides, among other things, worker protection ``atleast as effective as'' that protection provided under the Federal program.With respect to section 4 of Executive Order 12612, section 18 of the OSHAct also expresses Congress' clear intent to preempt state laws relatingto issues with respect to which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupationalsafety or health standards. Under the OSH Act, a state can avoid preemptiononly if it submits, and obtains Federal OSHA approval of, a plan for thedevelopment of such standards and their enforcement as mentioned above.Occupational safety and health standards developed by such Approved PlanStates must, among other things, be as least as effective in providingsafe and healthful employment and places of employment as the Federal standards.Under the OSH Act, if a state develops its own OSHA approved state program,it could include additional requirements in its standards. Moreover, theperformance nature of this final rule, of and by itself, allows for flexibilityby states to provide at least as much health protection, consonant withthe conditions in each state. In summary, there is a clear national problem, identified by Congress,related to occupational safety and health. While the individual states,if all acted collectively, might be able to deal with the health problemsinvolved, most have elected not to do so in the seventeen years since theenactment of the OSH Act. However, some states such as Washington havetaken action. Those states which have elected to participate under section18 of the OSH Act, would not be preempted by this final regulation andwould be able to address special, local conditions within the frameworkprovided by this standard while ensuring that their standards are at leastas effective as the Federal standard. State comments were invited on theproposal and those that were submitted to the record were fully consideredprior to promulgation of this Final Rule. The agency certifies that this document has been assessed in light of theprinciples, criteria, and requirements stated in sections 2 through 5 ofExecutive Order 12621. There are no provisions of this rulemaking thatare inconsistent with the principles, criteria and requirements statedin sections 2 through 5 of Executive Order 12621. States which have approvedstate occupational safety and health plans may incur additional costs associatedwith standards development and enforcement as a result of this rulemaking.Funding for these approved state plan programs is available from OSHA undersection 18 of the OSH Act. This rulemaking would not change the State'sability to discharge traditional State governmental functions or otheraspects of State sovereignty.H.

It also requires agencies to include a statement inthe notice of proposed rulemaking indicating that such information requirementshave been submitted to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the PaperworkReduction Act. The PELs update standard will create no additional recordkeepingrequirements. J. Maintaining Z-Tables Current This Rulemaking was designed to overcome an 18 year gap between the 1971adoption of the PELs in the 29 CFR 1910.1000 Z-Tables and the present.During this time period there were extensive changes in toxicology andhealth effects information, and the application of available control technologies.This resulted in the existing Z-Tables in 29 CFR 1910.1000 being out ofdate and incomplete. The new information demonstrated that some workersare not protected from exposure levels which represent a significant riskof material impairment of health. Because of the magnitude of changes during this 18-year period, this Rulemakinghas involved a large number of substances and interested parties. Consequently,OSHA designed this Rulemaking to use as a starting point the well establishedTLV's and REL's. The record during the public hearing was then used todetermine the appropriate final PEL, consistent with OSHA's statutory obligations.As a follow-up to this Rulemaking OSHA plans to develop and implement amethodology which will permit OSHA to keep the PELs current as time goeson. This point was raised by several commentors during the public hearing(ORC, TR 3-266; NAM, TR 3-338; G.E., TR 9-172), without specific detailregarding the best procedures OSHA should follow. OSHA agrees with thesesuggestions, and from the start of this Rulemaking has been consideringhow this objective can be attained. The program would be designed to beapplicable to all sectors (general industry, maritime, construction, andagriculture). The methodology adopted will be designed to avoid duplicativeefforts or gaps in coverage, to be protective of workers, and to be costeffective. Updating the PELs in the Z-Tables on a regular basis insures that the latestevidence is considered as it becomes available, and that appropriate actionto either reduce or increase permissible levels is initiated promptly.Commenters to this rulemaking cited several substances for which they believedsignificant new information would become available in the near future.OSHA intends to evaluate such evidence and, if appropriate, to initiateprompt action to revise the Z-Tables. OSHA may take such action on a singlesubstance or on several substances. This continual, dynamic process ofevaluation and revision, consistent with the priorities of the Agency willinsure that the Z-Tables reflect the latest scientific evidence on therisks posed by the listed substances. OSHA will use a variety of sources to determine which substances will beconsidered for updating. Information developed as a result of NIOSH studiesand the annaul updating of the TLVs will, of course, be used by OSHA. At this time OSHA has not developed the details of the up-date process.It is anticipated that it will be planned with regularly scheduled updateintervals, somewhere between 2 and 5 years. The process is expected tofollow full 6(b) rulemaking procedures. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Summary of Commenters' Responses to NPRM Questions</ITAG>In the preamble to the proposed rule (53 FR 20961), OSHA asked interestedparties and the public for information related to 27 questions. These questionsaddressed a large number of issues, such as the scope of the rulemaking,the appropriateness of the proposed exposure limits, the availability offeasibility information for particular substances, the definition of materialimpairment of health, and the availability of engineering and cost datarelevant to this rulemaking. Many commenters (see, for example, Exs. 3-593, 3-660, 3-741, 3-744, 3-891,3-896, 3-1095, 3-1161, 8-16, 8-19, and 8-47) submitted responses to thequestions raised by OSHA. Of these commenters, most chose only to answerselected questions, while NIOSH provided answers to all of the issues raised.The responses of commenters to each of the questions specifically askedin the preamble to the proposal are summarized below. In addition, manyparticipants addressed some of the issues raised by these questions intheir comments on the health effects or feasibility of individual substances.These comments are addressed in connection with the preamble discussionfor each substance. More detailed responses to some of these comments arediscussed in other sections of the preamble, in connection with the healthand feasibility discussions for specific substances. 1. Are substances included which should be excluded from this rulemaking?Several commenters (See, for example, Exs. 3-593, 3-891, 3-896, 3-1095,and 8-47) responded to this question. There was widespread support forOSHA's selection of substances for regulation. For example, the Dow ChemicalCompany (Ex. 3-741) ``supports the PEL project in changing outdated PELs.''Several commenters, however, requested that certain aspects of the proposalbe modified. For example, Susan Kernus, Manager of Government Affairs for the SyntheticOrganic Chemical Manufacturers Association (SOCMA), stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">We do not believe any substances included in the proposal should beexcluded, but we strongly object to the adoption of [NIOSH] REL's. We recommendthat ACGIH TLV's be adopted for these substances * * *. (Ex. 3-891, p.6).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">George Talley and Michael Garcia, industrial hygienists with the LosAlamos National Laboratory, argued that recommended exposure limits (RELs)with ``insufficient or old * * * data'' should be deleted, as also shouldsubstances for which sampling and analytical methods are unavailable (Ex.3-1095). Commenting for the Chevron Corporation, Stanley Dryden stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">We support the adoption of the ACGIH Short-Term Exposure Limits (STELs)that were established on the basis of careful review of documented short-termhealth effects. However, for several substances the proposed STELs are<T3>not </T3>adequately justified * * *. We recommend that the proposedSTELs be removed from this rulemaking <T3>except </T3>where there is clear evidence that the STEL is requiredto protect against a material impairment of health (Ex. 3-896, p. 3).</ITAG>U.V. Henderson, Jr., Director of Environmental Affairs for the Texaco Company,endorsed OSHA's choice of regulatory candidates by stating: ``No substancesare included in the listings which should be excluded from rulemaking''(Ex. 3-593). In response to this question, NIOSH expressed support forthe inclusion of the proposed substances but urged OSHA to take furtheraction ``immediately upon completion of this rulemaking * * * to establishPELs for all substances that are excluded from this rulemaking'' and forwhich NIOSH has made a recommendation to OSHA (Ex. 8-47, p. 17). NIOSHstated that OSHA should initiate ``consolidated rulemaking * * * to adoptall NIOSH RELs pending [the initiation of] chemical-specific Section 6(b)rulemaking * * *.'' (Ex. 8-47, p. 17).The support voiced by these commenters is gratifying to OSHA and increasesthe Agency's confidence that the substances selected for this generic rulemakingare both necessary and appropriate. The ancillary issues raised by thesecommenters, such as the appropriate basis for short-term exposure limits,the use of ACGIH TLVs in lieu of NIOSH RELs, and the initiation of otherrulemakings in the future, are addressed in other sections of this preamble,e.g., Section VI.C.17 (STELs), Section VI on the Agency's methods of selectingexposure limits, etc. Readers are referred to these sections for a detaileddiscussion of the record evidence on these topics.<T3>2. Is additional health and feasibility documentation available relativeto the proposed PELs beyond that described in the preamble?</T3>Several participants (see, for example, Exs. 3-741, 3-891, 3-1043, and8-47) specifically responded to this preamble question. (There were ofcourse many responses directed to health effects or feasibility issueson specific substances; these are presented in the discussions for individualsubstances (see Section VI).) The Synthetic and Organic Chemical ManufacturersAssociation (SOCMA) reported that it does not possess additional data buthas requested its members to submit to the docket any information availableto them (Ex. 3-891). Richard Olsen, project manager for the Dow ChemicalCompany, noted his company's support for the PEL project but stated thatDow was limiting its submission of additional data to certain substances,such as styrene and those chemicals for which OSHA proposed the adoptionof NIOSH RELs. According to Mr. Olsen, ``Feasibility documentation is notreadily available in the time allowed to prepare this submission becauseit resides mainly with our customers.'' However, Dow did ask several ofits customers to submit feasibility information to the record (Ex. 3-741).The American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME)stated that OSHA had not evaluated 14 other lists developed by professionalorganizations and foreign bodies'' (Ex. 3-1043). AFSCME is of the opinionthat OSHA should have started its analysis with the most protective standard.NIOSH commented that additional health and feasibility data pertainingto these substances and affected sectors are available and urged OSHA toconsider criteria documents, health hazard evaluations, current intelligencebulletins and other NIOSH publications when developing the final rule.NIOSH also noted that several foreign governments (e.g., Germany, Sweden,West Germany), organizations (e.g., the American Industrial Hygiene Association,the International Labour Organisation), and research groups (e.g., theNational Toxicology Program, the International Agency for Research on Cancer)have provided extensive toxicity information (Ex. 8-47, pp. 17-18).In the proposal, OSHA relied extensively on the health effects informationmade available by these and other organizations and individuals; the referencelist for the health effects section of the proposal alone included morethan 1,000 citations to the toxicological literature. In the developmentof the final rule, OSHA has gone beyond this initial list to include hundredsof additional citations and has additionally performed a thorough analysisof all data submitted to the rulemaking docket.OSHA appreciates NIOSH's submission of data to the record and the effortsof SOCMA and the Dow Chemical Company to obtain feasibility data from theirmembers and customers, repectively. Information submitted by NIOSH andthese individuals is discussed in other portions of this preamble in connectionwith the specific feasibility concerns and health effects issues raisedby these commenters.<T3>3. Are substances included in this rulemaking used in industries otherthan those described in the preamble? and</T3><T3>4. Are substances included in this rulemaking used for purposes otherthan those described in the preamble?</T3>NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) responded to these two questions together by noting thatit has submitted to the record a printout of the complete NIOSHTIC database file. This information often contains industry-specific data on exposures,operations, and controls, and OSHA has analyzed this information as partof this rulemaking. No other commenters provided responses specificallyto these questions, and OSHA therefore believes that the proposal and itsappendices accurately identified both the major chemical-using industriesby Standard Industrial Classification and the major uses applicable tosubstances included in this rulemaking.<T3>5. Do alternative unpublished exposure guidelines exist, such as thoseused in private workplaces, which may be suitable for general usage?</T3>Several respondents (see, for example, Exs. 3-741, 3-1095, and 8-47) submittedinformation about internal corporate guidelines. George M. Talley and MichaelGarcia, with the Los Alamos National Laboratory, reported that severalindustries have such limits (Ex. 3-1095), and the Dow Chemical Company(Ex. 3-741) acknowledged that it has developed internal limits for 250chemicals used in its plants. However, Dow does not believe that theseunpublished exposure guidelines are appropriate ``for general usage'' becausethey were developed specifically for Dow's operations and facilities. Dowreports that these limits have not been ``appropriately peer reviewed foroperations outside our company'' (Ex. 3-741, p. 21).NIOSH commented (Ex. 8-47) that many of the private workplaces it has surveyedhave internal exposure guidelines and that, in many cases, these limitsare considerably lower than OSHA's existing limits. NIOSH noted that exposureguidelines for two of the substances included in this rulemaking, solubleand insoluble uranium, have been established by the International Commissionon Radiation Protection and the National Commission on Radiation Protection.Several corporations, for example, Rohm and Haas and the Dow Chemical Company,submitted some or all of their internal exposure guidelines to the docket,and OSHA has reviewed these submittals carefully. For the reasons discussedin Section IV.D of this preamble, however, OSHA determined that the ACGIHand NIOSH exposure limits were the most appropriate data bases for OSHAto use as starting points for the rulemaking. In the overwhelming majorityof cases, the record has supported this decision, and the limits includedin this final rule are consistent with those proposed. In a few instances,OSHA has determined, based on evidence submitted to the record, that anotherlimit is more appropriate; the record evidence in these cases is discussedin detail in the chemical-specific discussions in Section VI.<T3>6. Is there information regarding laboratory analytical procedureswhich may be used in lieu of those suggested by OSHA to determine exposureto air contaminants?</T3>Several commenters responded to this question (Exs. 3-1095, 8-19, and 8-47).Representatives of the Los Alamos National Laboratory gave OSHA specificinformation on an improved method for the analysis of methylene dianiline,a substance that is not included in this rulemaking because a section 6(b)rule is being developed for it at the present time (Ex. 3-1095). NIOSHnoted several corrections to the NIOSH Analytical Methods published inAppendix A of the proposal; these corrections have been incorporated intoAppendix A of this final rule. In addition, NIOSH stated that, in AppendixA of the proposal, several existing NIOSH analytical methods ``have beenextended to compounds for which the suggested method has not been verified''(Ex. 8-47, p. 22). In several such instances, according to NIOSH, the compoundto which the method has been extended differs from the compound for whichthe method was originally developed.According to NIOSH, the analytical methods for the following substanceswould benefit from additional analysis:<ITAG tagnum="25">1-3-dichloropropene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">2-hydroxypropyl acrylate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">propargyl alcohol</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">isooctyl alcohol</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">trichloroacetic acid</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">dichloroacetylene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">chlorodifluoromethane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">chloropentafluoroethane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">o-chlorostyrene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">o-chlorotoluene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">cyclopentane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">hexane isomers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">hydrogenated terphenyls</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">N-isopropylaniline</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">methyl silicate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">nonane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">p-toluidine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">m-toluidine.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Based on its experience, OSHA concludes that there are adequate methodsfor the sampling and analysis of the substances. As noted in this preamble,additional work is planned regarding further evaluation of these methods.In addition, OSHA's experience shows that the promulgation of new permissibleexposure limits has often encouraged the development of appropriate analyticaland sampling methods. In 1971, at the time of the adoption of the start-upstandards, few sampling and analytical methods had been developed, andNIOSH was charged with the responsibility of developing and validatingsuch methods. The success of this approach is evidenced by the fact that,at the time of the June proposal, only seven substances of the 428 includedin the rulemaking were identified as lacking any sampling and analyticalmethods (53 FR 20978). (In the course of this rulemaking methods for twoof these seven, the subtilisins and cyanamide, were submitted to OSHA.)Another example of the incentive to develop methods provided by the settingof new limits can be seen in the case of OSHA's recent ethylene oxide (EtO)standard. At the time of the promulgation of the final rule, in June of1984, no accurate and easy-to-use method was available to measure short-termEtO exposures; however, by 1986, OSHA's Salt Lake City Laboratory had developeda simple and efficient method using hydrogen-bromine-impregnated charcoaltubes. By 1987, OSHA's research and development effort had led to the developmentof a commercial product that is now widely available: small, easy-to-use,and inexpensive charcoal tubes for taking employee-breathing-zone measurementsof EtO STEL exposures. In addition, several manufacturers have developedpassive dosimeters for EtO STEL monitoring. OSHA believes that this samecourse of research and development, which illustrates the successful workingof the market, will occur for the very few substances currently withoutanalytical methods in this rulemaking.7. Are the proposed exposure limits for each substance appropriate?OSHA received responses to this question from many rulemaking participants(see, for example, Exs. 3-593, 3-741, 3-891, 3-896, 8-16, 8-19, and 8-47).(In addition, many commenters addressed the appropriateness of the PELsfor specific substances; these commenters are addressed in Section VI.Cof the preamble.) There was substantial support among these commentersfor adoption of the proposed limits that were based on the ACGIH TLVs (Exs.3-593, 3-891, 3-741, and 3-1095). For example, the Texaco Company stated,``The TLVs are current, well documented, and widely accepted by the industrialhygiene community'' (Ex. 3-593). Several respondents felt that the 17 proposedlimits that were based on NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limits (RELs) werenot appropriate (Ex. 3-593, 3-891, 3-741, and 3-1095). Typical of the reasoningof these commenters was the statement of U.V. Henderson, Jr., Directorof Environmental Affairs for the Texaco Corporation:<ITAG tagnum="21">Only the ACGIH TLVs should be used as the best available source forOSHA to update * * * [its] exposure standards. The TLVs are current, welldocumented, and widely accepted by the industrial hygiene community. ManyState-approved OSHA programs incorporate the TLVs as their basis for regulations.The NIOSH recommended limits are oftentimes outdated and conservative.Furthermore, feasibility and cost-effectiveness are not always addressedby NIOSH (Ex. 3-593, Attachment, p. 1).</ITAG>The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), on the other hand,was entirely in favor of OSHA's used of either an ACGIH or a NIOSH limit,as the case required:<ITAG tagnum="21">AIHA supports the adoption by OSHA of NIOSH REL values as PELs ona case-by-case basis where such values are supported by the scientificevidence and are feasible from the standpoint of implementation.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NIOSH expressed strong support for this rulemaking in general butsubmitted specific comments on a number of substances that it believesshould have different limits from those proposed (Ex. 8-47). However, NIOSHstated at the hearing that, for substances lacking NIOSH RELs, the useof the ACGIH's TLVs as a starting point is appropriate (Tr. pp. 3-130_3-131).NIOSH's substance-specific comments are addressed in connection with thepreamble discussion of these substances (see Section VI).OSHA is gratified by the degree of support for the proposal expressed bythese and other rulemaking commenters. The Agency agrees with the AIHAthat the appropriate way to establish exposure limits is on a case-by-casebasis, considering health effects and feasibility concurrently. This isthe methodology used by OSHA in the proposal, and the final rule appliesthese same principles to the setting of limits for individual substances.<T3>8. Is additional information available for those substances for whichACGIH proposed a higher TLV which might affect OSHA's decision that sucha change was not justified? </T3>Only NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) responded specifically to this preamble question.NIOSH expessed the opinion that a comprehensive section 6(b) rulemakingis required if OSHA is considering raising, rather than lowering, a particularexposure limit. OSHA believes that the issue is not so much the <T3>type</T3> of rulemaking, i.e., generic vs. substance-specific, as thesignificance of the risk involved. For example, when raising a limit, theAgency must be able to show that ``exposed workers will not be placed atincreased risk for the health effects at issue even after the limit inquestion has been raised or revoked * * *'' (53 FR 21213). The guidingprinciples were first enunciated by OSHA when the Agency revoked the cottondust limit for facilities in specific nontextile industries (50 FR 51120<T3>et seq.</T3>), and this issue was subsequently discussed in the presentrulemaking in the proposal section pertaining to substances for which theACGIH TLVs are higher than OSHA's existing limits (53 FR 21213). OSHA continuesto believe that those principles, rather than the type of rulemaking, constitutethe test the Agency must meet when a limit is proposed for raising or revocation.<T3>9. Should implementation dates for some substances be delayed becauseof sampling/analytical limitations or short term feasibility impact considerations?</T3>Several commenters (Exs. 3-823, 3-891, 3-905, 3-960, 3-1095, 8-16, 3-741,and 3-891) questioned OSHA's promulgation of PELS for substances for whichavailable sampling/analytical methods are not adequate. The Los AlamosNational Laboratory (Ex. 3-1095) commented that OSHA ``should delay implementationdates for substances that do not have adequate sampling and analyticalprocedures until such methods are available and validated. It is unreasonableto expect compliance when the chemicals cannot be quantified.'' NIOSH (Ex.8-47) commented that some substances have no sampling and analytical methodsand that methods for others have not been validated by OSHA or NIOSH. Appendix A to the proposed rule provided data on the status of samplingand analytical methods for all of the substances included in this rulemaking.For a number of substances, in-house sampling and analysis methods areavailable; copies of these methods have been supplied by OSHA to any partyrequesting them, and they are also available in the docket for this rulemaking.No commenter has suggested that any of these in-house methods is inadequate;however, commenters have made general comments on interlaboratory testingand exchange programs and their benefits in terms of method standardization.NIOSH has recommended additional evaluation of the sampling and analyticalprocedures for several substances. OSHA has considerable expertise and experience in developing sampling andanalytical methods. The Agency has determined that these in-house methodsare adequate for enforcement purposes. (Any employer or laboratory wishinga copy of the entire set of methods can purchase them from the ACGIH. Copiesof any individual method may be obtained by calling the OSHA Salt LakeCity Laboratory, (801) 524-5287.) There have been no objections to anysampling and analytical method for any specific substance. Consequently,OSHA will enforce all of the exposure limits in the final rule except inthe seven cases where no sampling and analytical method is known to OSHA.OSHA identifed seven substances in Table 1-F-E of the proposal (53 FR 20978)as not having adequate sampling/analysis methods (aluminum alkyls, cyanamide,ethylidene norbornene, hexafluoroacetone, mercury [alkyl compounds], subtilisins,and sulfur pentafluoride). (In the course of this rulemaking, commenterssubmitted methods for two of the substances listed in the proposal as havingno method: Cyanamide and the subtilisins. However, commenters also identifedtwo other substances, phenylphosphine and oxygen difluoride, as lackingmethods.) In the final rule, OSHA is promulgating permissible exposurelimits for aluminum alkyls, ethylidene norbornene, hexafluoroacetone, mercury[alkyl compounds], oxygen difluoride, phenylphosphine, and sulfur pentafluoride.However, the Agency is staying the enforcement of these limits until anacceptable sampling and analytical technology is devised. When such techniquesare developed, OSHA will publish a <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice indicating that fact and setting forththe date on which enforcement will commence.<T3>10. Is there additional information relative to the OSHA plans to adoptsome recommended 10-hour TWA RELs as an 8-hour TWA PEL?</T3>OSHA received few comments in response to this question (see, for example,Exs. 3-1095, 3-623, and 8-47). Representatives of the Los Alamos National Laboratory supported OSHA'suse of NIOSH 10-hour limits as 8-hour TWAs:<ITAG tagnum="21">[W]e support these plans * * * [because this] is a conservative approachand appropriate (Ex. 3-1095).</ITAG>George Lathrop of Kerr-McGee Corporation (Ex. 3-623) observed:<ITAG tagnum="21">[T]he NIOSH Recommended Exposure Levels (REL's) are based upon 10-hourwork shifts in a 40-hour work week. The OSHA PEL's, as well as the ACGHrecommended TLV's, are based upon 8-hour work shifts in a 40-hour workweek. OSHA preliminarily concludes that the NIOSH REL is equivalent tothe OSHA PEL's definition. These two values are equivalent only if theirinterpretation is based on the length of the work (i.e., 40 hours). Ifthe interpretation of the OSHA PEL's and the NIOSH REL is based on thelength of the work shift (8 or 10 hours, respectively), then these valuesare not equivalent. If OSHA adopts a NIOSH REL for a particular substance,a notation should exist which identifies the exposure level as based ona 10-hour work shift or the level should be adjusted to represent an 8-hourwork shift (Ex. 3-623, p. 3).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) provided a detailed response and explained that NIOSH10-hour RELs are intended to apply to either 8-hour or 10-hour days ina 40-hour workweek. NIOSH explained that the 10-hour REL originated duringthe energy crisis of the 1970s. When many employers began to use 10-hour/4-daywork schedules to conserve energy (Ex. 8-47, p. 25). Thus, the 40-hourworkweek rather than the length of a workday is, in NIOSH's view, the importanttime element in the (concentration) X (time) equation: Any given REL canbe applied to either four 10-hour days or five 8-hour days without beingexceeded. NIOSH supports OSHA's proposal to apply 10-hour NIOSH RELs to8-hour days by stating:<ITAG tagnum="21">The action proposed by OSHA in this rulemaking relative to these RELsis consistent with that original intent (Ex. 8-47, p. 26).</ITAG>In this final rule. OSHA is therefore applying values derived from NIOSHRELs as 8-hour TWA PELs. <T3>11. Does the most current scientific information generally supportacceptance of the hypothesis that all C</T3><T2>5^8</T2> alkanes are not equally toxic because a metabolite of n-hexaneexhibits unique neurotoxic properties? The C<T2>5^8</T2> alkanes include pentane, n-hexane, hexane isomers, n-heptane,octane, and the refined petroleum solvents, namely rubber solvent (naphtha),Stoddard solvent, and VM andamp; P naptha. There is some disagreement regardingthe question of equal toxicity for all C<T2>5^8</T2> alkanes, which impacts on the determination of appropriatePELs on the basis of neuropathic effects resulting from exposure to thesesubstances. n-Hexane has been shown to produce distal axonopathy in both experimentalanimals and humans; it is metabolized to 2,5-hexanedione (2,5-HD), whichis thought to be the agent that produces peripheral neuropathy after exposureto n-hexane (Schaumburg, and Spencer, Thomas 1983/Ex. 1-228). The ACGIHarrived at a TLV of 50 ppm for n-hexane, based primarily on studies byMiyagaki (1967/Ex. 1-198) and Inoue, Takeuchi. Takeuchi et al. (1970/Ex.1-75) showing peripheral neuropathies at exposure levels as low 210 ppm.A number of studies have shown a consistent relationship between exposurelevels of 500 to 2000 ppm n-hexane and the development of characteristicperipheral neuropathies (Yamamura 1969/Ex. 1-42; Yamada 1967/Ex. 1-192).Neuropathic effects have also been shown to occur at level between 210and 500 ppm n-hexane (Takeuchi, Maluchi, and Takagi 1975/Ex. 1-217).  The NIOSH (1977a/Ex. 1-223) RELs for the C<T2>5^8</T2> alkanes are based on the belief that polyneuropathy may becaused by other alkanes (or mixtures of alkanes) and their isomers. NIOSH(1977a/Ex. 1-223) relied heavily on two studies by Gaultier, Rancurel,Piva, and Efthymioc (1973/Ex. 1-123) and Truhaut et al. (1973, as citedin ACGIH 1986, p. 305, ``n-Hexane''). The report by Gaultier et al. (1973/Ex.1-123) reported that five workers in a belt-manufacturing shop developedpolyneuropathy as a result of exposure to a solvent that contained 80 percentpentane, 14 percent heptane, and 5 percent hexane. The authors concludedthat pentane and heptane, as well as hexane, might also have caused thispolyneuritis. Truhaut et al. (1973, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 305, ``n-Hexane'') exposedWistar rats to airborne hexane (technical grade) at a concentration of2000 ppm and to heptane (technical grade) at a concentration of 1500 ppmfor five hours/day, five days/week, for one to six months. The analysisof technical grade hexane was: 0.3 percent n-pentane, 25.1 percent 2-methylpentane+ cyclopentane, 18.4 percent 3-methylpentane, 45 percent n-hexane, 8 percentmethyl cyclopentane, 1.2 percent methyl hexane, and 1.2 percent benzene.The analysis of technical grade heptane was; 9.8 percent 2-methylhexane,2,3-dimethyl pentane, and cyclohexane; 16.2 percent 3-methylhexane; 52.4percent n-heptane; 18.2 percent 2,4-dimethylene, methylcyclohexane, andtoluene; 3.3 percent methylheptane; 0.1 percent benzene; and 2.8 percenttoluene. The exposed rats developed polyneuropathy, and NIOSH considersthis study as evidence indicating that different alkanes cause polyneuropathy.Since 1977, when NIOSH published its criteria document on alkanes (C<T2>5^8</T2>), considerable evidence has accumulated that demonstratesthat peripheral neuropathies are caused only by n-hexane and gamma-diketonemetabolites (O'Donoghue 1985).The following summaries of publications show that n-hexane, and not thehexane isomers, n-pentane, n-hexane, of octane, is the primary cause ofperipheral neuropathy.1. Peripheral neuropathy comparable to that seen in human cases has beenreproduced using rats, cats, monkeys, hens, and pigeons exposed to n-hexane,practical grade hexanes (which contain n-hexane and benzene), or gasolinecontaining n-hexane (O'Donoghue 1985).2. Egan et al. (1980) exposed rats for 22 hours per day, for periods upto six months, at 500-ppm concentrations of an n-hexane ``free'' isomermixture: no evidence of neurotoxic effects was observed. A second groupof rats exposed to 1 ppm of methyl n-butyl ketone, a positive control,developed histological evidence of peripheral neuropathy after four monthsof continuous exposure.3, Takeuchi et al. (1980) performed a comparative study on the neurotoxicityof n-pentane, n-hexane, and n-heptane in the rat. Rats were exposed to3000 ppm of n-pentane, n-hexane, or n-heptane for 12 hours/day for 16 weeks.The experiment showed that n-hexane distributed the conduction velocityof the motor nerve and the mixed nerve and prolonged the distal latencyin the rats' tails, but that n-pentane and n-heptane did not. Light- andelectron-microscopic examinations showed that the peripheral nerve, theneuromuscular junction, and the muscle fibers of the rats exposed to n-hexaneor n-heptane showed no particular changes after 16 weeks of exposure. Theseresults show that n-hexane is far more toxic to the peripheral nerve ofthe rat than is n-pentane or n-heptane.4. Frontali et al. (1981) exposed rats to n-hexane or n-heptane for 9 to10 hours/day, 5 to 6 days/week, for a period of 30 weeks. Animals treatedwith n-hexane at 5000 ppm for 14 weeks or at 2500 ppm for 30 weeks developedthe typical giant axonal degeneration already described by Spencer andSchaumburg (1976) in rats treated continuously with 400 to 600 ppm of n-hexanefor seven weeks or more. No such alterations were found in the rats subjectedto intermittent respiratory treatments with n-pentane at 3000 ppm for 30weeks or to n-heptane at 1500 ppm for 30 weeks. Again, this demonstratesthe greater neurotoxicity of n-hexane compared with that of its isomers.5. Bahima et al. (1984) conducted a study on female Wistar rats exposedby inhalation to 2000 ppm n-heptane for 12 weeks. No clinical evidenceof neurotoxicity was observed after n-heptane exposure. Urinary metaboliteswere identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The n-heptanemetabolites were 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-heptanols, 2- and 3-heptanones, 2,5-and 2,6-heptanediols, 5-hydroxy-2-heptanone, 6-hydroxy-2-heptanone, 6-hydroxy-3-heptanone,2,5- and 2,6-heptanediones, and gamma-valerolactone. 2,5-Heptanedione,a known neurotoxic agent, was the metabolite found in least amounts inthe urine. The authors concluded that the lack of neurotoxicity was dueto the small amount of 2,5-heptanedione produced after n-heptane exposure.6. Olson et al (1986) studied the metabolism of n-octane in Fischer 344rats. The urinary metabolites of n-octane in rats given n-octane by gavageincluded 2-octanol, 3-octanol, 5-oxohexanoic acid, and 6-oxoheptanoic acid.n-Octane was not metabolized to a ketone, diketone, or diol derivative.None of the metabolites excreted are known to cause peripheral neuropathyin rats.7. Spencer and Schaumburg (1985) point out that alkanes normally undergosubterminal carbon oxidation. The likelihood of producing neurotoxic levelsof gamma-diketone metabolites from alkanes higher in the series than n-hexaneis unlikely. Shorter-chain alkanes (pentane) and hexane isomers free ofn-hexane also fail to produce the appropriate metabolite and do not induceneuropathy in experimental animals. The authors further conclude that n-hexaneis unique among the alkanes in producing peripheral neuropathy in humans.8. Recent studies have suggested a mechanism for the structural basis ofthe neurotoxicity of gamm-diketones. Studies reported by Sayre et al. (1986)and Genter et al. (1987) demonstrate that only those hydrocarbons capableof gamm-diketone and pyrrole formation are potentially neurotoxic. Chronicexposure to gamma-diketones results in the formation of giant neurofilament-containingaxonal enlargements.9. Several commenters (Exs. 3-896, 3-740, and 3-593) were in agreementwith the points made in the discussion of this issue, above.10. NIOSH (1988/Ex. 8-47) continues to support its conclusions as to theneurotoxicity of all of the C<T2>5-8</T2> alkanes, as discussed in the 1977 criteria document (1977a/Ex.1-223). NIOSH believes that n-hexane and other C<T2>5-8</T2> alkanes or related chemicals are ultimately metabolized toa gamma-diketone and thus may have similar neurotoxic properties. Accordingly,in the 1977 criteria document on alkanes (C<T2>5-8</T2>), NIOSH proposed a REL of 350 mg/m \3\ as a TWA concentrationfor up to a 10-hour work shift for the straight and branched-chain aliphaticisomers of pentane, hexane, heptane, and octane (NIOSH 1977a/Ex. 1-223).OSHA finds NIOSH's argument on this issue unconvincing in light of theconsistent results obtained by a number of investigators using a varietyof experimental procedures (see item 1 through 9, above). Therefore, theAgency concludes that only n-hexane has been proved to cause peripheralneuropathy at this time and that other alkanes, such as n-pentane, n-heptane,octane, and the hexane isomers, do not appear to cause peripheral neuropathy.Consequently, OSHA's initial assessment of the relative toxicity of theC<T2>5-8</T2> alkanes (53 <T3>FR</T3> 20998) remains unchanged.<T3>12. OSHA has Proposed to use Exposure Limits From two Well-Establishedsets of Guidelines as a Source of Values to Update the PELs. Is Informationavailable about alternative sources which OSHA might consider for thispurpose?</T3>Several commenters (see, for example, Exs. 3-1095, 8-16, and 8-47) responsedto this preamble question. Representatives of the Los Alamos National Laboratory(Ex. 3-1095) noted that many industries have voluntary guidelines thatmight be considered by OSHA if individual companies or trade associationssubmit them to the docket.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) mentioned as excellent sources the 9 data sets referredto by OSHA in the preamble to the proposal (53 FR 20967) and additionallyrecommended as a potential source the Nordic Expert Group for Documentationof Occupational Exposure Limits. NIOSH stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">No single source should be expected to stand alone as a comprehensivelist of candidates for regulation. OSHA should construct its own comprehensivelist by drawing information from all available sources (Ex. 8-47, p. 28).</ITAG>The Agency used the ACGIH TLVs and NIOSH RELs as starting points and thencarefully reviewed the testimony and comments submitted in the course ofthis rulemaking. If additional information was needed, the Agency examinedadditional toxicological sources. After careful review and evaluation ofthis body of information on any given substance and in conformance withAgency policy and statutory requirements, OSHA then determined the appropriatePEL or PELs for each substance.The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) also responded to thisquestion (Ex. 8-16). The AIHA submitted a complete set of that organization'sWorkplace Environmental Exposure Level (WEEL) Guides, with supporting documentation,to OSHA to consider as PEL replacement values. The AIHA described the processby which the WEEL committee establishes these levels and reported thatsuch factors as production rate, acute toxicity, and extent of the interestexpressed by the entire AIHA membership are taken into account when decidingwhat substances to consider for WEELs (Ex. 8-16).As noted in the preamble to the proposal (53 FR 20967), OSHA cnsiderednine sets of exposure limits, including the WEELs, when the proposal wasbeing developed. OSHA agrees in general that the WEEL values ``constitutea well-established set of guidelines for more than 40 substances'' (Ex.8-16); however, the Agency was not able to use the WEELs as replacementPELs in the present rulemaking because, to date, fewer than 40 WEELs havebeen developed. OSHA concludes that the reasons identified by OSHA in theproposal (53 FR 20967) for using the ACGlH TLVs and the NIOSH RELs as startingpoints were appropriate.<T3>13. OSHA has outlined its criteria for identifying special situations.Are alternative criteria available which might be used in lieu of these,or in addition to them?</T3>Several rulemaking participants responded to this question; these commentswere similar to those provided in response to questions 6 and 9 on analyticmethods. See the responses to these questions for a discussion of thisissue.<T3>14. OSHA has outlined three alternative procedures for dealing withsubstances requiring special attention. Are additional approaches availablewhich might be used in lieu of these, or in addition to them?</T3> Four commenters (Exs. 3-1095, 3-593, 3-891, and 8-47) responded to thisquestion, which referred to three approaches suggested by OSHA as possibleways of treating the substances in this rulemaking that require specialattention (53 FR 20978-79). These three alternatives were: (1) In-depth review of all available data for each substance and the establishmentof a PEL at the level indicated by this review; (2) Adoption of a limit in this rulemaking, to be followed later by separaterulemaking if the data warrant further analysis; or (3) Retain the existing OSHA limits for special-attention substances andproceed later with follow-up review and possible 6(b) rulemaking. A large majority of commenters endorsed the second approach for substancesidentified in the course of the rulemaking as warranting special attention(see, for example, Exs. 3-1095, 3-593, 3-891, and 8-47). The Synthetic Organic Chemicals Manufacturing Association (SOCMA) had nosuggestions for alternatives to the three approaches suggested by OSHA(Ex. 3-891). SOCMA found the second approach to dealing with special situationsmost appropriate; however, the association urged OSHA not to use NIOSHrecommended exposure limits (RELs) as interim values but instead to relyon the ACGIH limits for this purpose (Ex. 3-891). The Texaco Company agreedwith SOCMA that NIOSH RELs should not be used as interim PELs (Ex. 3-593),while representatives of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (Ex. 3-1095)believe that limits should not be promulgated for those substances lackingsampling and analytical methods. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) supported OSHA's suggestionthat it might be appropriate to mandate limits for all substances immediatelyand then follow this generic rulemaking with separate rulemaking, as theevidence dictates. NIOSH believes that in some instances, a full 6(b) rulemakingis required. According to NIOSH: <ITAG tagnum="21">NIOSH concurs with OSHA that it is in the best interest of the workerto promptly provide such increased health protection as is indicated bythe evidence in the record (Ex. 8-47, p. 32). </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">OSHA has concluded that this second approach constitutes the bestmethod of protecting the health and well-being of the largest possiblenumber of workers in the shortest possible time frame. Accordingly, theAgency is today promulgating limits for all but a few of the substancesfor which limits were proposed. Depending on resources, OSHA may considerfor additional rulemaking those substances identified in this preambleas warranting further consideration. <T3>15. OSHA has performed feasibility analyses for the following substances,based on limited available information: acetonitrite, carbon disulfide,carbon monoxide, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, ethylene dichloride,ethylene glycol dinitrate, fibrous glass dust, hydrogen cyanide, isophoronediisocyanate, nitrogen dioxide, nitroglycerin, and trichloro-ethylene.Is further information available which might be used to supplement thepresent findings regarding the feasibility of achieving these levels inthe workplace?</T3>The Synthetic Organic Chemicals Manufacturing Association (SOCMA) (Ex.3-891), the Dow Chemical Company (Ex. 3-741), the Teepak Corporation (Ex.8-19), and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) each responded to this question. The Dow ChemicalCompany (Ex. 3-741) commented on the difficulty of obtaining feasibilityinformation, especially for ``the small business entities which will bemost heavily impacted,'' while SOCMA (Ex. 3-891) opposed the promulgationof NIOSH limits if the feasibility information available was not adequate.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) submitted feasibility information to OSHA for the substanceslisted and for acetone, chlorine, styrene, and sulfur dioxide as well.OSHA appreciates NIOSH's submission and is using this information in itsfeasibility analyses for individual substances (see Section VI). For the final rule, OSHA went beyond the feasibility analyses presentedin the proposal. The Agency incorporated the substantial amount of feasibilitydata submitted by NIOSH and other submitters. OSHA also reviewed the sitevisit reports submitted into the record. Based on the entire record, OSHAhas concluded that the Agency has sufficient feasibility data to supportthe final rule's PELs. These data are analyzed in depth, by industry sector,in Section VII. <T3>16. OSHA has made a preliminary assessment of the proposed rulemaking'simpact on large and small establishments. The Act requires OSHA to determinewhether a regulation will have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities, pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980,5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. Is there additional information regarding implementationof this rule for small businesses and entities which OSHA should consider?</T3>The U.S. Borax and Chemical Corporation (Ex. 3-744), SOCMA (Ex. 3-891),and the Dow Chemical Company (Ex. 3-741) each responded to this preamblequestion. SOCMA expects ``some adverse impact'' on its smaller member companiesbecause these companies are likely to have greater difficulty than othersin absorbing the costs of controls (Ex. 3-891). SOCMA believes that suchcompanies are particularly likely to be severely impacted if REL, ratherthan TLV, values are promulgated as OSHA PELs; in SOCMA's views, selectionof TLV values as PELs ``will substantially reduce the feasibility problemsof the proposal'' (Ex. 3-891). The Dow Chemical Company (Ex. 3-741) agreeswith SOCMA that the largest impact of the rulemaking will be on smallerestablishments, and also that promulgation of values consistent with thoseof the ACGIH, rahter than with those of NIOSH, will mitigate any such impact.Eugene Smith, Vice President for Government and Public Affairs of the U.S.Borax and Chemical Corporation, believes that the uses of ``sodium tetraborateas well as boron oxide are so ubiquitous in their applications that a completedocumentation of their uses in industrial and household applications isvirtually impossible'' (Ex. 3-744, p. 5). Mr. Smith reports that he isaware of ``very small companies who would find installation of the typeof engineering controls'' described in the proposal financially difficultto implement (Ex. 3-744, p. 5). OSHA is sympathetic to the concerns ofU.S. Borax and has focused much of the economic and feasibility analysisfor this rule on small entities that will be affected by this revisionor expansion of permissible exposure limits. The Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis (RFA) accompanying this final rule fully considers the impactsof this regulation on these entities and describes the magnitude of anydifferential small-business impacts. In the RFA, OSHA concludes that thefinal rule is feasible for small businesses. <T3>17. OSHA has proposed PELs for some substances, where the basis forthis proposal also includes a carcinogenicity designation (e.g., TLV withan A1 or A2 designation; REL with a Ca designation). Should OSHA includea similar carcinogen designation in the Z-4 table in this rulemaking?</T3>Several commenters (Exs. 3-741, 3-1008, 3-1095, 3-593, 3-660, 3-891, 8-16,and 8-47) responded to this question. Some commenters (Exs. 3-741 and 3-891)indicated that OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard already requires employersto inform employees about the carcinogenic hazards of any substances listedas carcinogens by IARC or NTP. According to these respondents, identificationof substances as carcinogens in the Z tables would therefore be duplicativeand could cause confusion (Ex. 3-891). In addition, adding such informationto a table could be confusing because there is no method of adding extensiveexplanatory material to a table. Other commenters (Exs. 3-593, 3-1095,8-16 and 8-47) favored the addition of a cancer designation to carcinogenicsubstances included in the Z tables. For example, the American IndustrialHygiene Association (AIHA) stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">AIHA would support the inclusion of a designation on carcinogenicity* * * provided that such designation reflects the weight of evidence forcarcinogenic effects * * *. (Ex. 8-16, p. 14).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) concurred in recommending the inclusion of such adesignation in the final rule's Z tables.OSHA has carefully reviewed the record evidence on this issue and has investigatedthe various evaluative critieria used by scientific and regulatory bodiesto determine the classification of a substance as a carcinogen. The Agencynotes that each organization has a different system and that the criteriaused rarely coincide. Thus, the ACGIH uses two designations. A1 and A2,to refect the strength of the evidence for a substance's carcinogenicity,while the EPA has five classifications that represent different kinds ofevidence. OSHA believes that the inclusion of a cancer designation on theZ tables would further complicate this already complex situation by addingyet another classification system to those already in use. OSHA is alsoconcerned that adding a cancer designation to the Z-table limits wouldrequire frequent updating and revision as additional substances are identifiedas carcinogens in the future. Therefore, OSHA has determined that the presentsystem (in which the Z tables present the exposure limits for a substance,while the Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200) determines whetherthe evidence for a particular substance is such as to require employersto describe its carcinogenicity in their hazard communication programs)is the clearest and simplest approach to alerting workers to the hazardspresent in their workplaces.<T3>18. OSHA has preliminarily decided that for substances where the ACGIH,TLV is a TWA and the NIOSH, REL is a Ceiling Value which is the same orone-half of the TWA, OSHA will propose that the TWA be adopted as the PEL.Should this approach be modified in the final rulemaking? What approachshould be used when the converse of this situation (TLV, Ceiling-REL, TWA)exists.</T3>Several commenters were cautious concerning this approach. Los Alamos (Ex.3-1095) and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) concurred, recognizing that an analysis ofthe data supporting a proposed limit must be developed on a case-by-casebasis to discern which limit is appropriate. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) also statedthat the simple numerical relationship that OSHA has proposed is not ascientifically sound basis for choosing between a TWA and a ceiling value.The Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers Association (SOCMA) (Ex. 3-891)recommended that the TLV be adopted, whether the TLV is a ceiling valueor a TWA, since TLVs are the most appropriate levels for adoption. TheAmerican Federation of State and County Municipal Employees (AFSCME) (Ex.3-1043) recommended:<ITAG tagnum="21">OSHA should adopt most protective limit unless source dictates otherwise.Ceiling and STELS provide greater protection than TWA of the same numericalvalue (Ex. 3-1043, p. 5).</ITAG>Other commenters (Exs. 3-1043, 3-42, and 3-1095) also wanted to ensurethat OSHA understood the difference between TWA and ceiling values. OSHAunderstands that TWAs are not equal to ceiling limits and concurs withthe definition of these two limits discussed in NIOSH's submission:<ITAG tagnum="21">A TWA is appropriate as a limit when the toxic effect of the substanceis directly related to the total dose received in a daily exposure. Ceilingvalues are intended to minimize toxic effects related to the peak exposure.Ceiling values are necessary when there are immediate acute responses toan air contaminant independent of the total daily dose or when chroniceffects are dose-rate responses. Ceiling values are also used to minimizethe total daily dose when there is intermittent occupational exposure,e.g., ethylene oxide (Ex. 8-47).</ITAG>OSHA has always recognized the differences between TWA and ceiling limits;in the proposal, OSHA adopted the TWAs only as a starting point. Sincethat time, OSHA has analyzed the various docket submissions regarding individualsubstances. Based on these individual analyses, OSHA has developed updatedPELs on a case-by-case basis. (For information regarding a specific substance,refer to the discussion for that individual substance.) 19. OSHA preliminarily plans to adopt a phased start-up schedule. Thiswould include an initial start-up requirement permitting the use of alternatecontrol methods for revised PELs, followed at a later date by the requireduse of control methods fully consistent with the methods of compliancepriorities in effect at that time. OSHA will shortly be requesting commentson the heirarchy of controls. An alternate approach is to set compliancedates for engineering controls based on final determinations of that rulemaking.OSHA solicits comments on those approaches and suggestions regarding theappropriate times for the two proposed start-up dates. The proposed rule (53 FR 20960 <T3>et seq.</T3>) suggested six months from the publication date of thefinal regulation as a reasonable time for employers to evaluate the exposuresof their employees and to come into compliance using any combination ofrespirators, work practices, and engineering controls. Many commenters,such as the Texaco Company (Ex. 3-593) and the Synthetic Organic ChemicalManufacturers Association (SOCMA) (Ex. 3-891), indicated that the 6-monthcompliance date phase-in was appropriate. The Kerr-McGee Corporation (Ex.3-623) was more specific in its comments and contended that the initialsix-month period should be extended to a 24-month period to allow industrysufficient time to monitor and develop the necessary control measures.The American Paper Institute (Ex. 3-685) was also of the opinion that aninitial six-month compliance period would be too short. OSHA has extended the period to come into compliance using any method fromsix months from the date of publication to approximately six months fromthe effective date; this action adds two months to this period. OSHA concludes,based on the Agency's experience and many comments, that a six-month periodafter the effective date is sufficient to evaluate exposures and commencea respirator program. Most employers will only have employee overexposuresto a relatively few substances. (See also the discussion under the Scopeand Application of the standard.) Several companies stated that OSHA should grant a specific extension fortheir particular industries as a consequence of feasibility concerns. OSHAhas, however, considered the issues of feasibilty raised by rulemakingparticipants for specific industries and has determined that it is feasible,with few exceptions, for employers in affected industries to achieve compliancewith the limits promulgated in the final rule. These exceptions are discussedin Section VII of this preamble. In the proposal, OSHA also estimated that all employers, including thosewho would have to control exposures to several different chemicals, couldachieve compliance within four years using the hierarchy of controls (i.e.,preference for engineering controls and work practices, and, if not feasible,personal protective equipment) specified in 29 CFR 1910.1000(e). Regardingthe four-year engineering implementation date schedule, OSHA received anumber of comments. Most trade associations and employers supported thefour-year period, and most unions suggested that one to two years wouldbe sufficient. The State of Washington used 60 days for a similar regulationand reports that there were few difficulties with compliance. NIOSH (Ex.8-47) suggested that two years was a reasonable time for compliance. Thelongest period suggested was the period recommended by the Fibre Box Association(Ex. 3-823), which stated that 10 years for compliance by industry wasa reasonable time frame. OSHA has evaluated the data from various industriesregarding the feasibility of compliance and has determined that it is feasiblefor employers in nearly all operations to achieve compliance, using engineeringand work practice controls, by December 31, 1992. In light of the scopeof this regulation, OSHA concludes that a shorter period would not be appropriate.Since OSHA is in the process of reviewing the hierarchy of controls, OSHArequested comment on whether the compliance period should be tied intothe completion of that rulemaking. There were few responses to this query.A few companies (see, for example, Exs. 3-669 and 3-527) suggested thatthe Agency delay the four-year coming-into-compliance period until afterpublication of any new regulations on this subject; these commenters citedcosts of compliance as a major concern. The Dow Chemical Co. (Ex. 3-741)urged the Agency not to wait to set a start-up date for this rule. OSHAconcludes that the December 31, 1992 deadline specified is appropriateand is supported by most of industry. Section 1910.1000(e) has been ineffect for 18 years and reflects the view of most industrial hygienists.(See the Summary and Explanation section of the preamble for further details.)<T3>20. OSHA requests comment on whether the establishment of margins ofsafety below lowest observed or no-effect levels is consistent with theconcept of ``significant risk,'' and on whether the specific margins ofsafety proposed for specific chemicals are appropriate. </T3>Several commenters (see, for example, Exs. 3-744, 3-1095, 3-660, 8-16,and 8-47) submitted information to OSHA in response to this question. Representativesof the Los Alamos National Laboratory (Ex. 3-1095) noted that safety factorsmust be established on a case-by-case basis, while the U.S. Borax and ChemicalCorporation (Ex. 3-744) commented that dose-response information is neededbefore safety factors can be applied to set an exposure limit. The AmericanIndustrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) (Ex. 8-16) is of the opinion thatOSHA should adopt a ``uniform toxicologic basis for assigning such factors''and should change the term ``safety factor'' to ``uncertainty factor''in the final rule. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) stated that safety factors cannot be used to estimatehuman risk and are therefore not related to the magnitude or significanceof a risk; instead, safety factors are intended to reflect uncertaintyin knowledge or available data. NIOSH endorsed the use of safety factorsas a ``pragmatic method'' to develop standards except when a nonthresholdprocess, such as the induction of cancer, is the outcome of concern (Ex.8-47). NIOSH believes that ``standards based on a margin of safety * ** as well as standards derived from a case-by-case evaluation, [should]be periodically reviewed to determine what new information is available''(Ex. 8-47). OSHA is pleased that these commenters believe that the use of safety factorsor margins of safety is an appropriate method of adjusting for the absenceof complete information in the standards-setting process. OSHA agrees withNIOSH that this approach to limit-setting is appropriate when thresholdeffects are the endpoints of concern. (For a full discussion of safetyfactors, see Section VI.A and the Legal Analysis section of this preamble.)<T3>21. OSHA has identified sensory irritation, which causes rhinitis,cough, sputum production, chest pain, wheezing and dyspnea, as materialimpairment of health. OSHA invites comments on this understanding.</T3>Many commenters (see, for example, Exs. 3-744, 3-1095, 3-896, 8-47, 3-660,3-593 and 3-665) responded to this preamble question. A few were of theopinion that transitory or acute effects should not be considered materialimpairment of health; the U.S. Borax and Chemical Corporation (Ex. 3-744)believes that transitory ``rhinitis, cough, sputum production, chest pain,wheezing, and dyspnea'' do not constitute material health impairment. StanleyDryden of Chevron Corporation believes that ``mild irritants and odorants''should not be considered to pose a risk of material health impairment (Ex.3-896). Most commenters, however, agreed with OSHA that the signs and symptomslisted in this question should be regarded as material health impairments(Exs. 8-47, 3-1095, 3-660 and 3-593). NIOSH stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The recognition of sensory irritation as potentially being ``materialimpairment of health'' is consistent with the current scientific consensusrelated to health effects of environmental agents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mucous membrane irritants can cause increased blink frequency andtearing; nasal discharge, congestion, and sneezing; and cough, sputum production,chest discomfort, wheezing, chest tightness, and dyspnea. Work environmentsoften require levels of physical and mental performance considerably greaterthan encountered in daily living. Even in the absence of any permanentimpairment, the symptoms listed can interfere with job performance andsafety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mucous membrane irritation can result in inflammation, which may leadto increased susceptibility to nonspecific irritants and infectious agents.For example, experimental ozone exposure in humans results in increasedairway reactivity. Also, studies of exposure to environmental tobacco smokehave shown irritative symptoms and evidence of increased frequency of respiratorytract illnesses in young children and decreased pulmonary function in adults* * *.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mucous membrane irritation is associated with respiratory illnesses,depending on the composition of specific exposure and on the dose, duration,and frequency of exposure. No universally applicable conclusion can bedrawn at this time regarding the association between irritative symptomsand permanent injury or dysfunction. Where certain individuals show nomeasurable impairment after an exposure, even when experiencing irritativesymptoms, others may develop identifiable dysfunction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Aside from the effects of irritation, mucous membrane exposure mayresult in absorption of a substance, with resultant systemic toxicity.An inflamed mucous membrane may be an even more effective route of absorption,either for the irritant or for other substances. Furthermore, injury tobronchopulmonary membranes can impair removal of particulates from therespiratory system (Ex. 8-47).</ITAG>Thus, according to NIOSH, sensory irritants interfere with job performanceand safety, cause inflammation, may increase the victim's susceptibilityto other irritants and infectious agents, lead to permanent injury or dysfunction,or permit greater absorption of hazardous substances (Ex. 8-47). In sum,NIOSH and most other respondents agree with OSHA that sensory irritationcaused by occupational exposure to the irritant substances included inthis final rule constitutes a material impairment of health (see SectionVI.C.3). <T3>22. The question also arises of whether odorants present material impairmentof health. That issue also might arise in the context of other substances.Based on the evidence in the final record concerning this issue, OSHA willdetermine if the criteria detailed in Section IV-C-16 have been met, andtake appropriate action. OSHA requests comment on this issue. </T3>Section IV.C.11 of the preamble to the proposed rule (53 FR 21135-21136)described the adverse effects associated with exposure to four substancesincluded in the category of odorants. These substances are: Isopropyl ether,phenyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, and vinyl toluene. NIOSH(Ex. 8-47), the National Renderers Association (Ex. 3-11), the E.I. duPont Company (Ex. 3-660), the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association(Ex. 3-1161), and the Los Alamos National Laboratory (Ex. 3-1095), amongothers, commented on this issue. According to representatives of the LosAlamos National Laboratory, odorants should not be considered as causinga material health impairment (Ex. 3-1095); John Beary, III, a physicianspeaking for the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, is of the sameopinion (Ex. 3-1161). NIOSH described several important reasons for minimizing objectionableodors in the workplace.<ITAG tagnum="21">Odors emitted by industrial chemicals often play an important rolein occupational safety and health. When odors can be detected before healtheffects occur, they may provide early warning of exposure. A number ofchemicals have strong odors at concentrations which are otherwise minimallytoxic. These odors may cause undue health concerns among exposed workersor may create safety hazards by distracting workers from their tasks. Strongodors in the workplace may also mask the presence of other, more toxicsubstances. Strong odors can produce irritation and/or nausea at high concentrations,although these effects may be reversible following cessation of exposure.Olfactory fatigue often occurs and should be considered a functional impairmentthat can result in increased worker exposure. Olfactory fatigue can reducethe wearer's ability to sense inadequate respirator performance of air-purifyingrespirators (Ex. 8-47, p. 41).</ITAG>NIOSH thus concurs with OSHA that intolerable odors may have serious adverseeffects in the workplace. And, although it is true that there is wide variationin individual responses to odor (i.e., in the ability to detect an odor),it is also true that one individual may respond to an odor with only milddiscomfort, while another becomes overtly nauseated.OSHA has carefully weighed all of the evidence in the record on the toxicologicalsignificance of exposures to odorant chemicals. The Agency finds that odoreffects alone do not constitute material health impairment; however, OSHAnotes that it is exceedingly rare for a substance only to cause odor effects.It is generally the case that odorant chemicals also cause toxic effects,such as sensory irritation or incipient central nervous system effectsthat manifest as headaches, nausea, vertigo, or diplopia. However, forthe purposes of this rulemaking, OSHA concludes that odor alone does notconstitute material health impairment.<T3>23. Is there exposure information available which can be supplied whichwill refine OSHA's estimates of employee exposures and overexposures tothe substances being regulated?</T3>Although two other commenters (Exs. 3-744, 3-742) mentioned this proposalquestion, the only substantive comment received by OSHA in response specificallyto this question came from NIOSH (Ex. 8-47), which noted that it was submittingto the docket all relevant Health Hazard Evaluations (HHEs). OSHA has reviewedthese HHEs as they apply to the substances and sectors of interest andhas used data from these documents in the Regulatory Impact Analysis thataccompanies this final rule.<T3>24. Is there information available which can be supplied to improveor supplement the engineering controls identified as necessary in orderto reduce exposure levels? Is there additional cost data which can be suppliedto refine the annual costs associated with these controls?</T3>In response to this preamble question, the U.S. Borax and Chemical Corporation(Ex. 3-744) submitted data to show that, for the years 1979 through 1987,the average per-year cost for environmental control units at its BoraxOperation was $37,609. According to this commenter, since a large plantwould have many such units, the cost per plant for SIC 28 facilities presentedby OSHA in the proposal (53 FR 21376) is ``orders of magnitude'' lowerthan the costs plants would actually experience. In response to U.S. Borax,OSHA points out that the costs presented in the proposal were average annualcompliance costs for <T3>all</T3> large plants across <T3>all</T3> of SIC 28. Thus, it is likely that OSHA's costs may not exactlyapproximate those of any particular plant but will, in the aggregate, reflectthose of the average plant in this sector. OSHA has received no cost dataor information that calls these average compliance cost estimates intoquestion.In general, feasibility and cost data were directed toward individual substancesrather than being submitted in response to this question. These data arediscussed in detail in Section VII.<T3>25. Under what conditions, involving which industrial processes, willrespirators be needed during the start-up period, for maintenance operations,or where other controls are infeasible in order to protect employees atthe proposed exposure levels? Are respirators currently being used underthe conditions identified, or would they need to be purchased? Please describethe type of respirator currently in use or needed.</T3>This question elicited responses from several commenters (Exs. 3-593, 3-741,3-891, 3-1095 and 8-47). The Texaco Corporation (Ex. 3-593) identifiedseveral operations where respirators are required; these included fieldmaintenance of process equipment in refinery and petrochemical plants,confined space operations, asbestos stripping, and equipment repair. TheSynthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Association (SOCMA) (Ex. 3-891)noted that respirator use varies from job to job and that engineering controlsare not always feasible. The Dow Chemical Company (Ex. 3-741) reportedthat respirators are currently being used in industry where infrequenttasks make the costs of engineering controls infeasible; examples of suchoperations are maintenance operations, emergency operations, and certaininfrequently performed process operations. Dow had no information on thetype or extent of current respirator use. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) submitted datafrom a 1982 NIOSH-sponsored contractor report that shows that, in 1980,19.1 percent of mining, manufacturing, and construction workers wore orhad access to certified respirators. The same report showed that the marketshares of self-contained breathing apparatus, single-use, and chemicalcartridge respirators were approximately equal and ranged from 25 to 30percent each (Ex. 8-47).OSHA did not raise the issue of methods of compliance in this rulemaking.This question was asked to gather factual information. Section VII discussesthose few areas identified where respirator use may be needed. (See alsothe Legal Analysis sector.)<T3>26. As a result of simultaneously regulating many substances, whatcost savings will be realized in purchasing and installing engineeringcontrols? Are alternate engineering controls available to achieve the lowerpermissible exposure limits being proposed?</T3>OSHA received no substantive responses to this question. Several participants,including NIOSH and the unions presented evidence on situations in whichlower levels than those proposed could be achieved by means of engineeringand work practice controls. These cases are discussed in Section VII ofthe preamble.<T3>27. What is the current state of technology control and financing infirms which would need to comply with reduced exposure limits to wood dust?</T3>No commenters provided substantive responses to this question. Much informationwas submitted on the issues alluded to in this question; however, thisinformation was not submitted in response to this question but rather inrelation to the technological and economic feasibility of achieving theproposed limits for wood dust. This information is discussed in SectionVII.In addition to these 27 specific questions, OSHA solicited comments onthe appropriateness of considering 10-, 15-, and 20-minute NIOSH RELs as15-minute STELs and on the appropriateness of adopting PELs having otherdurations (i.e., 30-, 60-, or 120-minute ``ceilings''), such as those recommendedby NIOSH (53 FR 21242).Only the Kerr-McGee Corporation specifically addressed this question. Kerr-McGee(Ex. 3-623) was concerned that OSHA might, in the final rule, establishthe NIOSH 30, 60-, or 120-minute ceilings as 15-minute STELs. OSHA agreeswith Kerr-McGee that this approach would not be appropriate at this timewithout additional analysis. Where the NIOSH limit for a substance wasfor a duration of 30, 60, or 120 minutes, OSHA has generally maintainedthese intervals in the final rule. The final rule adopts 15-minute STELsin cases where NIOSH has recommended a 10-, 15-, or 20-minute limit.<ITAG tagnum="85">VI. Health Effects Discussion and Determination of Final PEL</ITAG>A.General Principles of Toxicology and Dose Response<ITAG tagnum="81">Introduction</ITAG>As long ago as the 16th century, people recognized that there is no suchthing as an absolutely safe chemical. The Swiss physician Paracelsus, wholived from 1493 to 1541, said:<ITAG tagnum="21">All substances are poisons; there is none which is not a poison. Theright dose differentiates a poison and a remedy.</ITAG>On the other hand, methods have been devised to permit any chemical, nomatter how poisonous, to be handled safely; this is done either by limitingthe dose or controlling the exposure. However, before the necessary degreeof control can be determined for a particular exposure or situation, thetoxicity of the substance in question must be known. The paragraphs thatfollow describe the methods used by scientists to measure the relativetoxicity of substances and to select exposure limits that will preventexposed individuals from suffering adverse effects from such exposures.As this discussion demonstrates, methods of choosing exposure limits must,because of the lack or inadequacy of dose-response information for manychemicals, rely on experience in the use of these substances and on scientificand professional judgment.*<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>* The material in this section derives principally from thefollowing sources: Klaasen, Amdur, and Doull 1986; National Research Council1986; Cohen 1986a, b; and Tardiff and Rodricks 1987.Chemicals range in inherent toxicity from those that are relatively harmlesseven after large doses have been administered to others that cause deathif encountered even in small quantities. Toxicologists rank chemicals bycategories that range from practically nontoxic (an adult human would haveto consume a quart) to supertoxic (fewer than 7 drops would be lethal formost people).In the occupational setting, it is the risk associated with a particularuse of a chemical rather than its inherent toxicity that is important.<T3>Risk </T3>can be defined as the probability that a substance will produceharm under certain conditions of use. The converse of risk is <T3>safety, </T3>which is the probability that no harm will occur underspecific circumstances.The degree of hazard associated with exposure to a specific substance dependson the manner in which it is handled in a particular situation: A supertoxicchemical that is processed in a closed, isolated system may be less hazardousin actual use than a low-toxicity compound handled in an open batch process.Another factor affecting the ability of a chemical to elicit a toxic responseis the susceptibility of the biological system or individual. For the relativedegree of hazard to be known in a particular instance, this requires knowledgeabout the chemical agent, the exposure situation, and the exposed subject.In addition, the route of administration and the duration and frequencyof exposure must be known.<ITAG tagnum="81">Route of Exposure</ITAG>There are four principal routes of exposure by which toxic substances caninvade humans or animals. These are inhalation, ingestion, dermal absorption,and parenteral administation (i.e., administration through routes otherthan the intestinal canal). The route of administration of a toxin alsoaffects the relative toxicity of the agent. For example, a chemical thatcan be detoxified in the liver will be less toxic if it is administeredorally than if it is given systematically (i.e., inhaled). Studies thatprovide information about the relative toxicity of an agent via differentroutes of exposure can provide a considerable amount of information aboutthe absorbability of the agent. For example, if exposure to a certain doseof a chemical via all routes of administration causes death within thesame time period, it can be assumed that the substance in question is easilyand rapidly absorbed. On the other hand, if the dermal dose of a chemicalthat is required to kill a subject is much higher than the dose requiredto produce the same effect when the chemical is ingested, one can deducethat the skin provides, to some degree, a barrier against that agent'stoxicity. Other, less important, elements affecting the response to a toxicsubstance include the relative concentration of the substance, the volumeof the vehicle used to administer the chemical, the chemical and physicalproperties of the vehicle, and the dose rate (i.e. the period of time overwhich the dose is administered). <ITAG tagnum="81">Duration and Frequency of Exposure</ITAG>Scientists conduct animal experiments that involve four different typesof exposure: Acute, subacute, chronic, and subchronic. Acute exposuresare limited to periods of less than 24 hours and can involve either singleor repeated exposures within that period. Subacute exposures are repeatedexposures that last for one month or less, while subchronic exposures havea duration of one to three months. When a research project having a chronicregimen is conducted, the test animals are dosed repeatedly for a periodlasting more than three months. Animals exposed acutely can have both immediateand delayed-onset responses. Similarly, chronic exposures can cause immediatereactions as well as long-term effects. The frequency of dosing also has an important influence on the magnitudeof the toxic effect: A large single dose of an acute toxin will usuallyhave more than three times the effect of one-third the dose given at threedifferent times, and the same dose administered in 10 or 15 applicationsmight have no effect whatsoever. The pattern of dosing is important becauseit is possible for some of the substance to be excreted between successiveadministrations or because the lesion caused by the toxin has a chanceto be partially or completely repaired between applications. Thus a chroniceffect is said to occur: (1) If a toxic sustance accumulates in the systemof an exposed person or animal because the dose absorbed is greater thanthe body's ability to transform or eliminate the substance; (2) if it producesadverse effects that are not reversible; or (3) if it is administered ina manner that permits inadequate time for repair or recovery.<ITAG tagnum="81">Variation in Response</ITAG>Responses to toxic insults vary in a number of ways. For example, sometoxicants have immediate effects, while others are associated with delayedsymptom onset. The latency period for carcinogenic agents may be as longas 40 years for some types of cancer, and even some acute agents, suchas some chemicals that have adverse ocular effects, may not cause overtsymptoms until hours after exposure. Another difference in type of response concerns the reversibility or irreversibilityof the effect. Reversibility depends on the site of action as well as themagnitude of the insult. That is, some tissues of the body, such as theliver, have considerable ability to regenerate; others, like the kidneyor central nervous system, do not. The site of action associated with toxic substances also varies widely.Local effects are those lesions caused at the site of first contact betweenthe agent and the organisms. Examples of localized effects are skin burnscaused by contact with a caustic substance and site-of-contact tumors thatdevelop at the locus of the injection of the carcinogen. In contrast to localized effects, systemic effects involve the absorptionand distribution of the toxic agent from the point of entry to a distantsite; the toxic response is manifested at this distant point. An exampleof a systemic poison is mercury, which produces its toxic effect on thecentral nervous system. Often, the site of deposition for a chemical isnot the organ system most affected by the toxin. For example, althoughlead is deposited and concentrated in the bone, it affects the centralnervous system. Any sites that are adversely affected by the toxic effects,of exposure to a substance, whether they are sites of contact or distalsites, are called the target organs of toxicity.In cases of systemic poisoning, the system most often affected is the centralnervous system (CNS); it is common for the CNS to be involved even whenanother target, such as the liver, is the primary target organ of toxicity.In descending order of frequency, the systems or organs most often involvedin cases of systemic poisoning are the central nervous system, the circulatorysystem, the blood and hematopoietic system, the visceral organs (liver,kidneys, lungs), and the skin. <ITAG tagnum="81">Dose-Response</ITAG>The relationship that associates the dose of a chemical with the effectsit causes is called the dose-response relationship. A single data pointrelating a dose to a response is sufficient to establish a dose-responserelationship. As additional data become available, it is possible to expandour understanding of the dose-response relationship to cover a range ofdoses or exposures. Dose-response is an important principle in toxicology,and an understanding of dose-response is important in establishing occupationalor other exposure limits. Knowing how toxic substances act makes it easierto predict the potential effects of exposure. (It is, of course, generallytrue that lowering dose reduces response, and data are often availableto demonstrate that lower doses reduce responses, at least on the grosslyobservable level. However, data showing that more subtle responses (e.g.,those at the subcellular level) have been reduced are rarely available.)To apply dose-response relationships, it is helpful if several types ofdata are available. First, it must be possible to relate a response toa particular chemical. Although basic data pointing toward causality maybe available, it is often difficult to refine the dose-response relationshipfurther. For example, epidemiological studies often identify an associationbetween a disease and one or more causative agents. However, since informationon the precise identity of the etiologic agent, the actual dose received,and the true site of the response is usually not available, it is oftenimpossible to use data from epidemiological studies to establish a precisedose-response relation between a specific dose of a toxin and an effect.The second condition to be met before dose-response can be establishedis that it must be possible to relate the response to the dose. It is relativelyeasy to determine that a large dose causes an obvious response. Refiningthe relationship, however, involves three other requirements: (1) Thatthere be a receptor site; (2) that the response and the intensity of theresponse be related to the concentration of the toxin at the receptor site;and (3) that the concentration of the toxin at the site be related to thedose given.The third principle underlying the concept of dose-response is that theremust be a quantifiable means of measuring the toxicity of a substance anda method of expressing this measured toxicity. Although lethality in testanimals is often used to measure toxicity, the best form of measurementwould involve quantification of the sequence of molecular events occurringduring the toxic response. In the absence of such endpoints, other goodmethods are available. For example, it is common to measure an effect believedto be related to the substance in question. The level of activity of anenzyme in the blood is often used as a measure of effect, e.g., serum glutamic-oxaloacetictransaminase (SGOT) levels are used to measure liver damage. Many differentendpoints can be used to measure toxic effects, such as changes in muscletone, heart rate, blood pressure, electrical activity of the brain, motorfunctioning, and behavior.The most widely used endpoint, especially when a new substance is involved,is lethality in an animal test system. Lethality studies allow scientiststo make comparative assessments of a chemical's toxicity as it relatesto that of many other substances. Research of this type also permits thegathering of essential information on dose, duration, route of administration,site of action, and the target organ of toxicity.<ITAG tagnum="81">Form of the Response</ITAG>The classic form of dose-response is sigmoidal (Figure 1). This form characterizesthe relationship between the amount of a toxin administered and the degreeof response to that dose. The response is measured on the ordinate, andthe dose is represented on the abscissa.Dose-response can be thought of in two ways:andbullet; As exposure increases, the proportion of the population that manifeststhe response increases (quantal response); andandbullet; As exposure increases, the intensity of an individual's responseincreases (graded response).A relatively flat dose-response curve means that a large change in doseis required before there is a significant change in response. A steep curve,on the other hand, means that a small change in dose will elicit a largeincrease in response. Although it is sometimes possible to generate a curveof the type shown in Figure 1, it is not necessary to do so to demonstratethat exposure at a given level is associated with a particular response.That is, it is not necessary to have sufficient data to define, in mathematicalterms, the dose-response relationship to know that exposure at a givenlevel is associated with adverse consequences.<G/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="94">insert illus. 212AIn the regulatory context, it is most common to express dose-response relationsin terms of the percentage of the population responding. However, beforethis information can be evaluated, the endpoint being considered must beknown. For every substance, there are several dose-response relationships,depending on endpoint: A substance that produces irritation at low dosesmay cause more severe symptoms or even death at high doses and in otherconditions. For example, many substances that are mucosal irritants atlow doses will produce pulmonary edema and nervous system effects at highdoses. Plotting the cumulative percentage of individuals responding against doseproduces the typical sigmoid curve. Such a curve reflects the fact thatat the lowest dose, zero percent of the population responds, while 100percent of the population will respond at the highest dose. However, ifthe percentage responding is plotted against incremental rather than totaldose, the curve produced is a normal distribution (Figure 2). This curvesays that a relatively small percentage of the population will manifestthe response at the lowest dose and that a similarly small percentage ofthe population will exhibit the effect only at the highest dose. What thisnormal distribution of response reflects is individual and species variationin exposed populations. A wide degree of variation occurs even in inbred,homogeneous laboratory animals, and such variability increases dramaticallywhen a heterogeneous population, such as workers, is involved. Individualsresponding at the left end of the curve shown in Figure 2 are hypersusceptible,while those at the right end could be termed resistant.<G/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="94">insert illus 0214ABecause the relationship between dose and response is sigmoidal, responseapproaches zero as dose approaches zero. However, because of the mathematicalform used to express this relationship, a true zero response can neverbe achieved. In the strictest sense, therefore, a true threshold dose level(i.e., the dose with which a zero response is associated) can never beestablished on the basis of experimental research. Instead, scientistsattempt to define the minimum dose associated with a specific endpoint,which is customarily termed the ``threshold'' dose for that particularendpoint. However, unless a specific endpoint (such as respiratory irritation,cholinesterase inhibition, the development of a tumor, or death) is specified,the concept of a threshold is essentially meaningless. In fact, a separatethreshold could be said to exist for each of these endpoints. The extent to which an experimentally derived ``threshold'' actually reflectsthe true threshold for a substance (i.e., the level above which a responsewill occur and below which no response will occur) depends on several factors,such as the number of animals used to determine the experimental threshold,the number of dose levels tested, and the degree of variation representedin the test subjects. For example, to determine an LD<T2>50</T2> (the lethal dose that will kill 50 percent of the animals tested)with a high degree of precision requires the use of a minimum of 50 testanimals and five dose groups (10 animals in each group). Other factorsthat can influence the magnitude of the median lethal dose include thesources involved, the sex and age of the animals, the environmental conditionprevailing during the test conditions, diet, the health status of the subjectsbeing tested, and the subjects' past exposure to other toxic substances.In toxicological research, the experimentally observed threshold dose iscalled the low-observed-effect level (LOEL) or the low-observed-adverse-effectlevel (LOAEL). Alternatively, the threshold may be expressed as the highestno-observed-effect level (NOEL), i.e., the highest dose administered andfound not to produce a given response. Determination of an accurate NOELrequires both a careful interpretation of the toxicological data and theuse of an adequate number of test animals. The National Academy of Sciences(1985) has concluded that the chance of finding a no-adverse-effect level(that is, of missing an adverse effect) at a given dose is statisticallygreater in experiments having a small number of animals than in studiesinvolving a large number of animals. Thus, the degree of confidence onehas that a NOEL actually represents a ``safe'' dose, rather than a researchdesign artifact, increases with the number of animals tested. The greatestdegree of confidence is associated with studies involving a large numberof animals that were tested at several doses that were administered atclose intervals.In a recent publication (Tardiff and Rodricks 1987), David W. Gaylor ofthe National Center for Toxicological Research explained that experimentallyderived thresholds represent statistical limitations in study design ratherthan biological characteristics:<ITAG tagnum="21">The existence of dose-response relationships might lead one to assumeincorrectly the existence of threshold doses below which no toxic effectscould occur. As dosage is decreased, the prevalence of an observable toxiceffect * * * diminishes to zero. Eventually, a dosage is reached belowwhich the experiment has essentially no resolving power to distinguishbetween the spontaneous background rate and small induced toxic effects* * *. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If no toxic effects are detected at a specified dosage, this dosageis called the no-effect, or more correctly the no-observed-effect dosage.Because of the limitations of any given experiment, the no-observed-effectdosage is not a precise estimate of a true no-effect level. Lack of statisticalsignificance is not equivalent to no toxic effect. It may or may not be,and further experimentation would be required to resolve this equivocalissue * * *. The no-observed-effect level is not a biological property,but, rather, a statistical property or operational threshold that is highlydependent on sample size.</ITAG>The scientific issues surrounding the concept of no-observed-effect levelsor experimentally derived thresholds have important implications for theiruse in establishing protective occupational exposure limits. Because theno-observed-effect level cannot represent the ``true'' threshold for anadverse effect, given the design of most toxicologic studies, regulatorsand others have used the concept of safety factors (also known as uncertaintyfactors) to aid them in setting permissible exposure limits; that is, theexposure limit is established at some interval below the no-observed-effectlevel to provide additional assurance that exposed populations are notlikely to suffer harm. The size of the interval between the permissible exposure limit and theno-observed-effect level depends on a professional judgment as to whetherthe no-observed-effect level is likely to represent a level that is notharmful to humans. Thus, if the available data include a NOEL derived froma well-conducted human study, a smaller safety factor might be used toestablish an exposure limit than would be used if the data to be used toestablish the limit consisted of a NOEL from an animal study; in the lattercase, there is greater uncertainty regarding the relationship between theanimal NOEL and human NOEL. Safety factors have also been used to recognizethe fact that the human population is heterogeneous and that there maybe a wide variation in individual responses to toxic substances (the widerange in the odor thresholds reported for some substances is a good illustrationof individual variability in response). The use of NOELs, LOAELs, and safety factors to develop permissible exposurelimits is not a recent development:<ITAG tagnum="21">For more than half a century, evaluation of the safe use of chemicalshas been focused mainly on the development of toxicity data and on theapplication of professional judgment to the ad hoc interpretation of suchdata to derive acceptable levels of exposure for humans. Generally, thispractice has taken the form of identifying from studies in laboratory animalsthe no-observed-effect level and dividing it by a safety factor (usually100 for NOELs derived from chronic studies) reflecting the uncertaintiesof relating data to humans under their conditions of exposure and the qualityand appropriateness of the data base * * *. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Safety factors are usually chosen prospectively to address the uncertaintiesof interspecies extrapolation. Although safety factors as small as 2 andas large as 2000 have been used * * * the safety factor of 100 is usedmost commonly, at least for NOELs derived from chronic toxicity studies,and incorporates adjustments for interspecies variability (usually 10)and intrahuman variability (usually 10) * * *. The resulting value is equivalentto a NOEL in humans (Tardiff and Rodricks 1987, pp. 391, 421.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Tardiff and Rodricks caution, however, that the use of safety factorshas been questioned because these factors ``often create the impressionthat human population thresholds have been identified and that there isvirtually no risk below that level of exposure'' (Tardiff and Rodricks1987, p. 421). Although safety factors have traditionally been used to establish exposurelimits for chronic or lifetime exposure situations, they have also beenapplied to establish limits for acute effects resulting from short-termexposure. The National Academy of Sciences' Committee on Toxicology hasbeen using a safety-factor approach to establish emergency exposure guidancelevels (EEGLs), which are exposure levels judged to be acceptable for militarypersonnel performing tasks during emergency situations. An EEGL is notconsidered to be a safe exposure level for routine or normal operations,but these levels are considered acceptable when tasks must be performedto prevent greater risks (e.g., death or injury caused by fires or explosions).In developing EEGLs, safety factors are generally applied to account foruncertainties in the use of animal data and when extrapolating betweendifferent dose routes. The NAS also develops short-term public emergencyexposure guidance levels (SPEGLs) to apply to the exposures of the generalpublic to contaminants during airborne chemical releases; SPEGLs are generallyset at a level of 0.1 to 0.5 times the EEGL (i.e., an additional safetyfactor of from 2 to 10) (<T3>Criteria and Methods for Preparing Emergency Exposure Guidance Level(EEGL), Short-Term Public Emergency Guidance Level (SPEGL), and ContinuousExposure Guidance level (CEGL) Documents.</T3> Washington, DC: NationalAcademy Press, National Academy of Sciences 1986). The use of the safety factor approach in establishing occupational exposurelimits was addressed by many rulemaking participants (Exs. 3-744, 3-1095,8-16, 8-47, 116, and 144; Tr. 1-221, Tr. 2-163 to 2-164). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47)stated that safety factors cannot be used to estimate human risk and aretherefore not related to the magnitude or significance of a risk; instead,NIOSH believes that safety factors are intended to reflect uncertaintyin the available data. This comment echoes the observation made by Tardiffand Rodricks, i.e., that safety factors do not necessarily identify a humanpopulation thereshold. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) also endorsed the use of safetyfactors as a ``pragmatic method'' of developing standards (except whena nonthreshold process, such as the induction of cancer, is the outcomeof concern). NIOSH also believes that ``standards based on a margin ofsafety * * * as well as standards derived from a case-by-case evaluation,[should] be periodically reviewed to determine what new information isavailable'' (Ex. 8-47).Dr. Marcus Key, Professor of Occupational Medicine at the University ofTexas School of Public Health, also testified on the appropriateness ofusing safety factors to establish occupational exposure limits: <ITAG tagnum="21">We seldom, if ever, know with any precision where a significant risklevel begins or ends; hence, the need for safety factors. Safety factorsdepend on several considerations. * * * mainly on toxicity and the natureof the health effects, but also on the availability of scientific evidenceof effects at lower levels. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Professional judgment must be relied on in selecting safety factors,with one to three orders of magnitude being commonly used for serious effects,and 50 percent, or [a] safety factor of 2, [being used] for acute, lessharmful effects (Tr. 1-221). </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Both Dr. Key (Tr. 1-221) and Dr. Ernest Mastromatteo, Chairman ofthe ACGIH TLV Committee (Tr. 2-163 to 2-164) testified that safety factorsare frequently used by the ACGIH to develop recommended exposure limits.Some commenters (Exs. 8-16, 116, and 144; Tr. 7-121) were of the opinionthat OSHA should adopt a uniform system of assigning safety factors toestablish permissible exposure limits. For example, the Workers' Institutefor Safety and Health (WISH) (Ex. 116, p. 13) commented that OSHA shouldreview the toxicology profiles prepared by the Agency for Toxic Substancesand Disease Registry (ATSDR), in which Reference Doses (RfD) are computed.The RfD, as described by WISH, is ``an estimate (with uncertainty spanningperhaps an order of magnitude) of the daily exposure of the human populationto a potential hazard that is likely to be without risk of deleteriouseffects during a lifetime'' (Ex. 116, p. 13). The RfD is derived by applyinguncertainty factors to experimentally derived NOAELs in a consistent manner.The uncertainty factors used by ATSDR include factors of 10 to accountfor each of the following: andbullet; Human variation in response; andbullet; Extrapolation from animals to humans; andbullet; Extrapolation of effects associated with lifetime exposure fromless-than-lifetime studies; and andbullet; Additional uncertainty in relying on a LOAEL rather than a NOAEL.In addition, ATSDR applies a factor of from 1 to 10 to account for theoverall quality of the scientific evidence. EPA uses the same approach to develop RfDs for noncarcinogens; EPA's applicationof this approach is described in a concept paper presented by the EPA ReferenceDose Work Group (Ex. 144, Appendix A). As explained by the Work Group:<ITAG tagnum="21">The RfD is useful as a reference point for gauging the potential effectsof other doses. Usually, doses that are less than the RfD are not likelyto be associated with any health risks, and are therefore less likely tobe of regulatory concern * * * Nonetheless, a clear conclusion cannot becategorically drawn that all doses below the RfD are ``acceptable'' andthat all doses in excess of the RfD are ``unacceptable'' (Ex. 144, AppendixA, p. A-10). </ITAG>The EPA has been compiling dose-response data and information on RfDs foralmost 2,000 chemicals in a database called the Integrated Risk InformationSystem (IRIS). The system is described by Dr. Rebecca T. Zagraniski, AssistantCommissioner of the Division of Occupational and Environmental Health,New Jersey Department of Health (Exs. 144 and 144A). In her posthearingsubmission, Dr. Zagraniski presents an analysis in which EPA RfDs fromthe IRIS system are converted to Workday Ambient Air Concentrations (WACs)for 43 of the substances included in this rulemaking. These WACs were thencompared to OSHA's proposed PELs for the same substances. After convertingthe RfDs to equivalent lifetime occupational exposure levels, Dr. Zagraniskifound that all but three of the resulting WACs were lower than 1 mg/m\3\and that the WACs for noncarcinogens were generally 100 to 1,000 timeslower than the PELs being proposed by OSHA in this rulemaking. Dr. Zagraniskicommented on these findings as they relate to OSHA's proposal:<ITAG tagnum="21">The WACs are not recommended exposure limits because they do not takeinto account numerous significant considerations including feasibility,anecdotal reports of effects following human exposure, routes of exposureother than inhalation, and other critical information. Also, the WACs fornon-carcinogens are based primarily on oral exposure studies. In some cases,there may be inhalation studies which are more appropriate for use in settingan occupational exposure guideline, but which were not discussed in IRISdue to their focus on the oral exposure route. In spite of these constraints,the WACs may be considered preliminary health-based guidelines which areuseful as indicators that current PELs and TLVs may need reevaluation (Ex.144A, p. 4). </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In response to Dr. Zagraniski's comments, OSHA notes that the approachsuggested by this commenter is new and was not supported by other participants.It is also inconsistent with the recommendation of most expert organizationsin this field and would require extensive analysis by OSHA before its meritcould be ascertained. Accordingly, OSHA finds this approach inappropriatefor use in the present rulemaking. In this rulemaking, OSHA has evaluated the efficacy of the final rule'slimits on a case-by-case basis, although the initial evaluation presentedin the NPRM relied heavily on analyses conducted by the ACGIH and NIOSH,the limits promulgated in the final rule are based on an expanded toxicologicassessment using information contained in the rulemaking record. OSHA believesthat, at this time, this case-by-case assessment is the best way to establishnew and revised limits for the numerous substances addressed in this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="81">Types of Toxicological Evidence </ITAG>The evidence available to scientists wishing to evaluate the toxicity ofa substance can be derived from studies in laboratory animals, <T3>in vitro</T3> studies in cell or tissue systems, reports of clinicalobservations, studies of exposed human populations, or from interventionstudies conducted with human volunteers. The preceding paragraphs havedescribed animal studies (or ``bioassays''). The following section discussesthe two most common types of human evidence: Data derived from clinicalobservations and information from epidemiological studies. <T3>Clinical observations.</T3> Much of the data on the toxic effects associatedwith human exposures have come from industrial accidents, fatal poisonings,or other such tragedies. This information is generally more useful in delineatingbroad categories of pathological effects than in refining a specific dose-responserelationship, because the exposure levels causing the accident are knownto be high but cannot be quantified with precision. <T3>Epidemiological studies.</T3> Studies conducted by epidemiologistsare designed to reveal the patterns of disease or mortality prevailingin certain groups of people (usually workers) exposed to a single toxinor to a group of substances. One of the advantages of epidemiological studiesis that they involve humans and their responses to actual situations. Theinterpretation of the results of epidemiological studies is complicatedby the inevitable presence of confounding variables that occur wheneverhuman populations are involved. Ideally, the populations being studied(i.e., the study population and the control population) should be fullycomparable with regard to every variable except the single characteristicunder study. Because it is rarely possible to achieve this degree of comparability,statistical techniques are often used to attempt to adjust for this lackof comparability. In addition, if the measured effect is relatively large,it is unlikely that confounding factors will obscure the true picture.Broadly speaking, epidemiological studies can have two possible outcomes:They can report an effect or they can report no effect; in the former case,the study is termed a positive study, and in the latter, a negative one.Within each of these categories, it is possible for the study to be correct(that is, to give a true-positive or true-negative result) or to be incorrect(that is, to give a false-positive or a false-negative result). A false-positiveresult reports that there is an increased risk when in fact there is not,and a false-negative study reports that there is no increased risk whenin fact there is. The probability that a study will detect a statistically significant effectif that effect is actually present is called the power of the study. Asthe power of a study increases, the likelihood of producing a false-negativeerror decreases. Power is dependent on two factors: The level of relativerisk being evaluated and the number of cases of the effect (i.e., disease)that are expected in the population being studied. The number of expectedcases depends both on the sample size and the expected disease frequencyin the comparison population. For example, a study involving a small populationand a common disease can have the same power as a study of a rare diseasein a large population. Consequently, studies of larger samples have sufficientpower to detect smaller increases in risk, and studies of smaller sampleswill be able only to detect large increases in relative risk. Because epidemiological studies have limitations, it is essential thatthe power of such studies, particularly of negative studies, be examinedto ensure that their sample sizes are adequate to detect the absence ofincreased risk with validity. When the power of a study is not adequate,negative studies cannot be said either to contradict or to support theconclusion that increased risk exists. Essentially, a negative epidemiologicstudy identifies a NOAEL, which, as discussed above, reflects the statisticallimitations of a study more than the ``true'' population threshold foran effect. However, a study with a positive result may indicate a relationshipif the excess risk is high, even if the study's sample size is small andthe effects of some factors are not controlled for. <ITAG tagnum="81">Quality of Evidence </ITAG>Dose-response models have often been used in the quantitative assessmentof the risks associated with exposures to carcinogenic substances. However,less scientific effort has been devoted to models to be used with non-carcinogenicsubstances. Mathematically precise methods to establish the true no-effectlevel or to define the dose-response curves have not been developed formost of the more than 400 substances involved in this rulemaking. Most of the scientific work that has been done was designed to identifylowest observed effect or no-effect levels for a variety of acute effects.As described above, experts in industrial hygiene and occupational healthhave developed factors to be used to offset, at least to some extent, theinsensitivity of NOELs and LOELs to such factors as subcellular effects,sensitive individuals, and chronic effects. It is possible to use thesedata, combined with professional judgment and OSHA's expertise and experience,to determine that significant risk exists at current levels of exposureand that a reduction in these levels will substantially reduce this riskof material impairment of health. OSHA is also confident that it is notattempting in this rulemaking to reduce exposures to insignificant levels.However, additional analysis may well reveal that the levels being establishedin the final rule can be refined further in the future. B. Historical Development of Occupational Exposure Limits Early LimitsUntil the development of occupational health standards, the occurrenceof adverse health effects resulting from exposures to hazardous substancesor conditions in the workplace could only be determined <T3>ex post facto</T3>_after impairment had already occurred to the healthand welfare of exposed employees. In her 1910 studies of lead poisoning,Dr. Alice Hamilton was forced to rely on ``personal observations of workingconditions and the illness and deaths of workers to demonstrate the existenceof harmful exposures'' (Paull 1984/Ex. 1-255). The concept of occupationalexposure limits thus represents a dramatic breakthrough in the battle againstoccupational disease and remains ``one of the most useful and indispensabletools yet devised for safeguarding the health and well-being of industrialworkers'' (Thomas 1979/Ex. 1-96). Occupational exposure limits are air quality values that apply in workplaces,and they are derived by studying the correlation between the amount ofa toxic substance absorbed by the body and its effects on health. Withinthe context of occupational exposure, knowledge of this relationship permitsquantification of the etiology ``of a large number of occupational healthimpairments, [evaluation of] the risk of such impairments and, if necessary,[consideration of] the effectiveness of preventive measures'' (Parmeggiani1973/Ex. 1-229). More specifically, an understanding of the levels at whichdisease or other health effects occur can be used to establish limits ofoccupational exposure below which health hazards are unlikely to occurin most workers.The historical development of occupational exposure limits began with thepublished reports of a German scientist whose investigations in 1883 intothe effects on experimental animals (and on himself) of carbon monoxidein known air concentrations caused him to conclude that ``the boundaryof injurious action of carbon monoxide lies at a concentration in all probabilityof 500 parts per million, but certainly [not less than] 200 parts per million''(Cook 1987/Ex. 1-187). Shortly after the appearance of this first documenteddose-response value, another German researcher, K. N. Lehmann, publisheda series of reports on a number of chemical substances under the title``Experimental Studies on the Effect of Technically and Hygienically ImportantGases and Vapors on the Organism.'' This series culminated in 1936 witha comprehensive paper on chlorinated hydrocarbons, published as Volume116 of <T3>Archiv fuandCx.174;4r Hygiene.</T3>In 1912, Rudolf Kobert published a table of exposure limits, based on animalstudies, for 20 compounds. One of the first tables of hazardous air concentrationsto originate in the United States was a technical paper published in 1921by the U.S. Bureau of Mines. The 33 substances included in this table werethose frequently encountered in the workplace. In addition to limits basedon acute toxic effects, this table provided some information on the leastdetectable odor concentration and the lowest airborne concentration requiredto cause irritation (Paull 1984/Ex. 1-255; Cook 1987/Ex. 1-187).Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, data became available that correlated concentrationsof harmful substances with observed effects on worker health for such materialsas lead and mercury compounds, benzene, and granite dusts. These earlyoccupational health studies, which were based on animal experiments andon findings in exposed workers, provided the kind of data needed to linkhuman exposures ``to concentrations that were capable of producing notonly acute, but chronic health effects'' (Paull 1984/Ex. 1-255).After 1935, the emphasis of researchers had shifted, for the most part,from the reporting of a series of values for a range of acute effects toresults that yielded a single limit based on studies of repeated exposures.Over the years, a sizable amount of data about the levels of exposure thatwould not produce injurious effects had been amassed for a considerablenumber of substances. ``By the early 1940s, control of the occupationalenvironment to prevent the harmful absorption of toxic materials was becomingan accepted principle, and the practical problem of defining what was `harmful'was beginning to be met by employing maximum allowable concentrations''(Paull 1984/Ex. 1-255). In 1943, Sterner (Ex. 1-806) explained the meaningof the term maximum allowable concentrations as ``the upper limit of concentrationof an atmospheric contaminant which will not cause injury to an individualexposed continuously during his working day and for indefinite periodsof time'' (Paull 1984/Ex. 1-255).The first lists of maximum allowable concentrations of airborne toxic substanceswere issued between 1933 and 1938. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics(U.S.S.R.) was the first country to make occupational exposure limits astatutory obligation; in 1933 it published a list that included 14 substances(although health standards for some air pollutants apparently were usedin the Soviet Union during the 1920s). The first American list was publishedfour years later by the State of Massachusetts, and in 1938 Germany issuedoccupational health standards for a number of organic solvents (Holmbergand Winell 1977/Ex. 1-141). Additionally, the United States ``imposed limitedoccupational safety and health requirements on certain contractors withthe Federal government'' when the Walsh-Healey Act was passed in 1936 (Mintz1984/Ex. 1-840).<ITAG tagnum="81">Standards Developed by Professional Organizations</ITAG>During the 1940s, American organizations led in the development of occupationalhealth standards, beginning with the American Standards Association (nowthe American National Standards Institute, or ANSI) list of ``maximum acceptableconcentrations'' (MACs), which appeared in 1941. This list representeda consensus of opinion by the ASA and a number of industrial hygienistswho had formed the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists(ACGIH) in 1938 (Baetjer 1980/Ex. 1-223). Originally conceived of as atime-weighted concentration to be maintained as an average over the workingshift, the MAC was redefined in 1957 to mean an upper level (ceiling level)that should never be exceeded (Turner 1976/Ex. 1-79).An important contribution to occupational health standard-setting was madein 1945 by Warren Cook (Ex. 1-726), who published a list of maximum allowableconcentrations for 132 industrial atmospheric contaminants. These limitshad been developed by six states, the U.S. Public Health Service, and theAmerican Standards Association, and included Cook's own list of ``acceptedor tentative values'' based on industrial experience, animal experimentation,human sensory response, or a combination of these factors. This table wasfollowed by<ITAG tagnum="21">Documentation supported by 187 specific references, indicating thebasis and reliability of each value. Cook was the first investigator tocodify all of the available data on MAC's and present it in one publication.His list of recommended values was incorporated, practically without changes,by the ACGIH in establishing the TLVs. In support of Cook's inferences,it should be noted that 50 of the * * * values that he recommended in 1945were subsequently adopted as federal standards, and are still in use today(Paull 1984/Ex. 1-255).</ITAG>The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists Subcommitteeon Threshold Limits presented its second report at the Eighth Annual Meetingof the ACGIH in 1946. The report included values for 131 gases, vapors,dusts, fumes, mists, and 13 mineral dusts ``compiled from the list reportedby this subcommittee * * * in 1942, from the list published by Warren Cookin * * * 1945, and from published values of the Z-37 Committee of the AmericanStandards Association'' (Cook 1987/Ex. 1-87). The Committee's report notedthat:<ITAG tagnum="21">Considerable difficulty attends the fixing of satisfactory valuesfor maximal allowable concentrations of chemicals in respirable atmospheresbecause of the lack of a uniform definition of the maximum allowable concentrationconcept. One concept is that the M.A.C. value should represent as accuratelyas possible that concentration at which a worker exposed for a sufficientperiod of time will just escape physiological or organic injury and occupationaldisease.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A second concept is that the M.A.C. should represent some fractionof that concentration which will injure the worker in order to allow amargin of safety in the design of protective equipment and guard againstpossible synergistic effects in the case of multiple exposures. A thirdconcept is that the M.A.C. should perform the functions of the former conceptsand in addition provide a work environment free of objectionable but non-injuriousconcentrations of smokes, dusts, irritants and odors. Obviously all ofthese concepts cannot be fulfilled with the establishment of a single value.M.A.C. values in use at the present time represent examples of all of theseconcepts. The committee feels that the establishment of dual lists or asingle definition is not possible at the present time (ACGlH 1946).</ITAG>The report concluded by stressing that the 1946 list of M.A.C. values waspresented ``with the definite understanding that it be subject to annualrevision'' (ACGIH 1946).Papers presented at both the Ninth International Congress on IndustrialMedicine in London (1948) and at the Fifteenth International Congress ofOccupational Health in Vienna (1966) also dealt with maximum acceptableconcentrations. The first of these proposed that zones of toxicity be setup to facilitate an understanding of the relative hazards of substances,``since the boundaries of MAC values were not sharp lines of demarcation''(Cook 1987/Ex. 1-87). At the 1966 meeting, discussion took place on theadvantages of the concept of a ``peak level'' of exposure_an extensionof the ``ceiling level'' notion inherent in the definition of a MAC since1957. A ``peak level'' was defined as one ``that can be applied to certainsubstances for brief designated periods and for a strictly limited numberof times during the work shift, with a designated time interval betweenpeaks. The `peak' concept places a limit on the intermittent higher exposuresthat occur in many industrial operations. The time-weighted average exposurelimit is of course to be observed [even when a peak has also been assignedto a substance]'' (Cook 1987/Ex. 1-87).Terminology and definitions throughout this early period were ambiguousand imprecise, reflecting uncertainty as to exactly what needed to be andcould be done in the realm of occupational health standard setting. Initially,the ACGIH designated its recommended limits as ``maximum allowable concentrations.''although this term was often used interchangeably with ``threshold limitvalues.'' Confusion about the meaning, interpretation, and relative significanceof the terms being employed during this embryonic period was common. After1953, the ACGIH defined the concept of threshold limit values in the prefaceto its annual published list of occupational health standards as ``maximumaverage atmospheric concentrations * * * for an eight-hour day.'' Thisdefinition of the TLVs as average concentrations differed from the generalunderstanding of the original term ``maximum allowable concentrations,''which were essentially ceiling values (Stokinger 1962/Ex. 1-998).Documentation for the 238 substances included in the TLV list for 1956was provided by Smyth (Ex. 1-759) in a separate paper in which the author:<ITAG tagnum="21">Recommended that the TLV's include references to the underlying data,and that the concepts represented by the values be restated in more realistictoxicological terms. In his analysis of the TLVs, he [Smyth] concludedthat nine categories of objectionable action were guarded against: Chronictoxicity, acute toxicity, narcosis, irritation, asphyxiation, fume fever,eye pigmentation, allergic response, and cancer (Paull 1984/Ex. 1-255).</ITAG>At about the same time, Stokinger stated that, in his opinion, the ThresholdLimits Committee had avoided grappling with the issue of developing a methodfor establishing limits for industrial carcinogens and noted that, withthe exception of nickel carbonyl, limits had not been assigned for potentialcarcinogens (Paull 1984/Ex. 1-255). In 1962, however, the TLV Committeeincluded three carcinogens as additions to the TLV list, although thesewere listed separately in an appendix and did not have assigned TLVs.Despite the fact that the ACGIH had stressed early on that TLVs were intendedas guides and not as rigidly enforceable limits, the American StandardsAssociation's MAC values (or, where none was available, the TLV) were includedas mandatory limits in the Safety and Health Standards for Federal SupplyContracts, which were published in 1960 under the Walsh-Healey Act. Followingthis action the ACGIH issued a statement on the definitions and interpretationsof TLVs and MACs (Stokinger 1962/Ex. 1-998). At the same time, the ACGIHannounced the production of the first edition of the <T3>Documentation for Threshold Limit Values</T3> (ACGIH 1962); this wasfollowed by another paper in which the work and intentions of the ThresholdLimits Committee were reviewed. Turner states that:<ITAG tagnum="21">[a]t this time the concept of ceiling values and excursion factorsaround the time-weighted average values was introduced in order to reduceconflict or confusion with the ``maximal'' values in the American [ANSI]Standerds. A ``C'' (ceiling value) listing was to be given to those fast-actingsubstances thought likely to be injurious if the concentration exceededthe limit value by more than a designated factor for a relatively shortperiod (about 15 min.). The factor varied between 3 and 1.25, dependinginversely upon the magnitude of the TLV. A corollary was that the factorwould also indicate the limit of permissive excursion of the concentrationabove the TLV for a substance not given a ``C'' listing, always providedthat the time-weighted average concentration did not exceed the TLV. Thisrule of thumb approach to limiting exposure is no doubt appropriate tocertain substances when they are used routinely throughout the workingday. It seems to have little relevance in other instances where exposureis irregular or where the basis for fixing the TLV is on grounds otherthan toxicity (Turner 1976/Ex. 1-79).</ITAG>Several commenters (Tr. pp. 6-30 to 6-31, 7-119, 8-139 to 8-141, and 8-167)were of the opinion that the ACGIH's procedures for establishing TLVs werenot open to comment and that its reasons for selecting certain TLVs werenot clear. Dr. Ernest Mastromatteo, Chairman of the ACGIH's TLV Committee,explained the organization's limit-setting process at the hearing (Tr.pp. 2-113 to 2-128). He stated that the Committee's minutes have recentlybeen made public and explained that the committee often invited industryor union consultants to help the committee in its work on the TLVs (however,these consultants do not vote on the recommended limits). In addition,Dr. Mastromatteo described the ACGIH's process of placing new or revisedlimits on an ``Intended'' list for a period of two years, during whichtime comments on the proposed limits are invited, and considered.<ITAG tagnum="81">Permissible Exposure Limits in the Era of OSHA</ITAG>The enactment of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 markedthe first ``comprehensive and serious attempt * * * to protect the healthand safety of American workers'' (Mintz 1984/Ex. 1-840); it also greatlyextended the use of MACs and TLVs by authorizing the newly establishedOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to adopt as its ownstandards ``national consensus standards'' and established federal standards(29 U.S.C. 655 (a)). Mintz notes that ``in addition to the safety standardsadopted under section 6(a), OSHA also adopted permissible exposure limitsfor approximately 400 toxic substances. These [start-up] health standards,now appearing in 29 CFR 1910.1000 * * * were derived from both nationalconsensus and established federal standards. The national consensus standardshad been issued by ANSI, while the established federal standards had beenadopted under the Walsh-Healey Act from the TLVs * * * recommended by the* * * ACGIH'' (Mintz 1984/Ex. 1-840).Since OSHA's large-scale adoption of the ANSI consensus standards and the1968 ACGIH TLVs, the Agency has promulgated standards under section 6(b)of the OSH Act to regulate the industrial use of 24 substances, most ofwhich have been identified as occupational carcinogens, but the ANSI andACGIH start-up standards continue to comprise the major part of the Agency'soccupational health and safety program.In the interval since the establishment of OSHA and the adoption of theACGIH and ANSI limits by the Agency, the ACGIH has continued to revise,update, and document the recommended limits that appear in its annual listof TLVs. Since 1968, annual revisions have been made to these limits bythe ACGIH. During this time, the TLVs have been ``accepted on an internationalbasis as the best available guides for providing healthful occupationalenvironments, and at least 18 countries, including the United States, haveeither adopted them as legal standards or as guides to legal action, thusverifying their efficacy in accomplishing this purpose'' (Paull 1984/Ex.1-255).The action OSHA takes today initiates the process of updating the Agency'sZ-table permissible exposure limits. That these limits were seriously outof date is attested to by the fact that the ACGIH has found it necessaryto revise or add nearly 400 limits to its list in the 20 years since thelimits that were later adopted by OSHA were initially published. Recognitionthat OSHA's Z-table limits need updating to reflect recent developmentsin toxicology and new data on the health effects associated with exposureto these substances is widespread throughout industry: For example, OSHA'sHazard Communication standard (29 CFR 1910.1200) requires organizationsthat develop Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) to include on these MSDSsthe ACGIH's current TLV values as well as OSHA's limits.The following section describes the methodology used by OSHA in selectingthe limits it is promulgating today. The Agency believes that promulgationof these limits will address a broad range of significant risks now prevalentin industry. As many industrial hygienists and occupational safety andhealth professionals have noted, the use of permissible exposure limitscontinues to be the single most efficacious way of protecting the health,functional capacity, and well-being of the American worker. C. Description of the Substances For Which Limits Are Being EstablishedIn this rulemaking, OSHA considered revising 428 substances, and the finalrule is revising existing or adding new limits for several hundred toxicsubstances currently being manufactured, used, or handled in workplacesthroughout general industry. This section of the preamble identifies thePELs being established, describes the available toxicological data, andexplains the Agency's rationale for selecting the final permissible exposurelimits for these substances.The universe of substances included in this rulemaking is bounded by thesubstances for which the American Conference of Governmental IndustrialHygienists (ACGIH) has established a Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for exposuresin the work environment. That is, OSHA is not at this time establishingexposure limits for any hazardous substance that is not included in theACGIH's 1987-88 List of TLVs. In addition, where the limit included inthe current ACGIH list was identical to OSHA's existing Z-table limit forthe same substance, OSHA did not consider revising its existing limit.Although new limits are not being established for chemicals excluded fromthe ACGIH's 1987-88 list, OSHA has not limited its initial considerationof appropriate limits to those levels established by the ACGIH. The Agencyhas also carefully evaluated the exposure limits recommended by the NationalInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), OSHA's sister agency.In instances where both NIOSH and the ACGIH have recommended substantiallydifferent limits for the same substance, OSHA has thoroughly analyzed theevidence presented by each organization and has made its own judgment ofthe appropriate level at which to establish the PEL. For all substancesaddressed in this rulemaking, OSHA has also evaluated the extensive recordevidence. The limits being established today thus represent, in the Agency'sprofessional judgment, those levels found to be most consistent with thebest available toxicological data, OSHA's mandate, and the case law thathas subsequently developed to interpret that mandate. (For a discussionof the relevant legislative and judicial principles, see the sections ofthis preamble entitled Pertinent Legal Authority, History and Need forRevision of the PELs, and Approach). For ease of analysis and presentation, the substances included in the scopeof this rulemaking have been grouped into 18 separate sub-sections. Ingeneral, these groupings reflect the primary basis underlying the ACGIHor NIOSH recommended limits for these substances. In addition, three additionalsections cover substances for which the ACGIH has increased its limits,substances for which OSHA is adding short-term limits, and those for whichthe Agency is adding skin notations.The following sections are included:1. Substances for which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Neuropathic Effects.2. Substances for which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Narcotic Effects.3. Substances for which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Sensory Irritation.4. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Liver or KidneyEffects.5. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Ocular Effects.6. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Respiratory Effects.7. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of CardiovascularEffects.8. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Systemic Toxicity.9. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Observed-No-Adverse-EffectLevels.10. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Physical Irritationand Other Effects.11. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Odor Effects.12. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Analogy to Related Substances.13. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Biochemical/MetabolicEffects.14. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of SensitizationEffects.15. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Cancer.16. Substances for Which Current ACGIH TLVs Are Less Stringent than FormerOSHA PELs.17. Substances for Which OSHA is Establishing Short-Term Exposure Limits.18. Substances for Which OSHA is Adding Skin Notations.A list of the references that OSHA relied on in evaluating the toxicologicalevidence pertaining to these chemicals appears in Section VI-D. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of NeuropathicEffects</ITAG>Introduction Many industrial chemicals have been shown to cause severe neurologicaleffects in exposed workers, and in many cases these effects are irreversible.Limits have been set on the basis of avoidance of neuropathic effects for20 substances. Table C1-1 lists the former, proposed, and final rule limits,CAS number, and OSHA HS number for each of these substances. The tableshows time-weighted averages (TWAs), ceiling limits, and short-term exposurelimits (STELs). For this group of 20 substances, OSHA is lowering its formerTWA-PEL for three substances; adding a STEL to a former or a revised TWAfor four substances; changing a ceiling to a TWA or a TWA to a ceilingfor four substances; establishing permissible exposure limits for sevensubstances not formerly regulated by OSHA; retaining an existing TWA butchanging its accompanying ceiling to a STEL for one substance; and loweringthe former TWA and changing its accompanying ceiling to a STEL for onesubstance. Description of the Health Effects The human nervous system comprises the central nervous system (CNS) andperipheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS is made up of the brain and spinalcord, while the PNS consists of a network throughout the body of nervesthat communicate with the CNS via connections to the spinal cord. The brainand spinal cord are bathed in cerebrospinal fluid, which supplies nutrientsto the CNS and also acts as a barrier against some foreign substances.This barrier protects the central nervous system. In general, fat-solublesubstances readily diffuse across this barrier and water soluble substancesdo not. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 003</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 0246-248</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Chemicals that affect the central nervous system may manifest their toxiceffects peripherally. An example of this is the tremor associated withelemental and organic mercury poisoning. Exposure to some chemicals (forexample, n-hexane) is associated with axonal degeneration of the nervesin both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Baker (1983/ Ex. 1-230)refers to this dual-system effect as central-peripheral distal axonopathy.Nervous system toxicants can affect motor function, sensory function, orintegrative processes, and they can also cause changes in the behaviorof exposed persons. Substances that cause demyelination or neuronal damagecan produce motor dysfunction that is expressed as muscular weakness orunsteadiness of gait, while exposures to chemicals that are associatedwith loss of sensory function may result in alterations in touch, pain,or temperature sensation or damage to sight or hearing. Other neuropathicchemicals affect the way in which information is processed in the brainand can interfere with learning and memory. All of the health effects describedabove constitute material impairments of health within the meaning of theAct. Although mature neurons cannot divide and be replaced, the nervous systemhas considerable ability to restore function lost as a result of exposureto toxic chemicals. This capability to restore function even after neuronshave been killed is achieved by two mechanisms: Plasticity of organizationand redundancy of function. That is, when some neurons die, other cellsthat perform the same function may be able to maintain an adequate levelof functioning, or other neurons may be able to ``learn'' how to performthe lost function. However, even when one of these mechanisms comes intoplay to compensate for neuronal damage, the overall reserve capacity ofthe nervous system will have been diminished. The loss of this reservecould be critical in a situation in which additional demands are placedon the nervous system. Thus, even so-called reversible neuropathic effectsshould be seen as toxic effects causing alterations in and material impairmentof the normal functioning of the nervous system. The neurological effects potentially associated with chemical exposuresare numerous, and it is not always easy to identify the precise targetsite. However, recent medical advances have made tests available that candetect neurological damage that was not detectable several years ago. Forexample, electrophysiological methods have been developed to measure damageto the visual pathway caused by such exposures. Because of the variationin individual responses to chemical exposures, exposure limits should beset with a view toward this range of susceptibility and the avoidance ofany neuropathic effects. Peripheral Nervous System Effects The pathological mechanisms associated with peripheral neuropathies resultfrom segmental demyelination or axonal degeneration. Segmental demyelinationdestroys the myelin sheath but leaves the axon intact; this causes a slowingin nerve conduction velocity. Muscle weakness is often the first sign ofsuch segmental demyelination, and this effect can progress to a declinein motor function or paralysis. Although remyelination may occur withinweeks after injury, even a temporary loss in motor or sensory functionplaces the affected worker or others at risk of injury. Axonal degeneration is a more serious effect in that recovery is oftenslow or incomplete. It causes demyelination secondary to the degenerationof the distal portion of the nerve. This effect occurs when a chemicalinterferes with the physiologic dynamics of the nerve, e.g., when it decreasesthe transport of nutrients to the nerve. The axon will degenerate (dieback) sufficiently to accommodate the cell's capacity to supply it withnutrients. Axonal degeneration can also occur as a result of biochemicalor metabolic derangement of the central nervous system. Alkyl mercury andelemental mercury are examples of chemicals causing this type of effect(Cavanaugh 1977/Ex. 1-202). Central Nevous System Effects The mechanism of action of central nervous system toxins is not well understoodbut is believed to be associated with neurochemical alteration in the brain.Seizures, Parkinsonism, intellectual impairment, narcosis, dementia, cranialneuropathy, and visual disturbances are all examples of effects that canoccur after overexposures to neuropathic chemicals. The more serious CNSeffects, such as Parkinsonism, dementia, intellectural impairment, andcranial neuropathy, are generally irreversible (Baker 1983/Ex. 1-230).Before these effects are manifested, subtle changes in behavior may occur;if these subtle signs are interpreted correctly, exposure can be stoppedbefore irreversible damage occurs. Dose-Response Relationships and Neuropathic Effects The development of chemically induced neurological effects is believedto follow a dose-response pattern. At an exposure intensity or durationbelow the no-effect level, detectable effects are unlikely to be evident.As exposure intensity/duration increases to and beyond this level, thetoxin begins to interfere with the normal cellular processes of the neurologicalsystem. At this early stage, transient signs and symptoms may appear. Overteffects become more severe as exposure continues and finally progress toserious loss of neurological function and possible permanent damage toneural tissue. Increases in our ability to detect neurological changesat lower levels of exposure have shown that neurobehavioral changes orimpairment may occur at levels previously thought to be innocuous. Theseearly effects can be important indicators of potential functional impairmentat exposure levels below those that produce either transient or permanentdamage. Heavy metals, solvent, and pesticides are examples of chemicalsthat can cause symptoms that include nausea, sensory and motor functionimpairments, depression, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, andsexual dysfunction. Limits for substances in this group are generally designedto maintain worker exposures below the level associated with such symptoms.This approach ensures that employees will not be likely to suffer thesematerial impairments of health and provides a margin of safety againstthe risk of more severe or permanent neurological impairment. The following discussions describe the record evidence and OSHA's findingsfor all of the substances in this group and illustrate the material impairmentsof health faced by workers exposed to these toxicants.<ITAG tagnum="71">n-BUTYL ALCOHOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 71-36-3; Chemical Formula: CH<T4>3</T4>CH<T4>2</T4>CH<T4>2</T4>CH<T4>2</T4>OH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1051</ITAG>OSHA's former PEL for n-butyl-alcohol was a 100-ppm 8-hour TWA: the ACGIHlimit is a 50-ppm ceiling, with a skin notation. The proposed and finalrule PEL is a 50-ppm ceiling, with a skin notation. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) concurs that these limits are appropriate. n-Butyl alcohol is a colorless,highly refractive liquid with a mild vinous odor that has long been knownto cause irritation of the eyes and headaches in occupational settings.Systemic effects in the form of vestibular and auditory nerve injurieshave been reported in workers in France and Mexico (Seitz 1972 and Velasquez1964, both as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 76; Velasquez, Escobar, andAlmaraz 1969/Ex. 1-1174). Contact dermatitis of the hands may occur dueto the defatting action of liquid n-butyl alcohol, and toxic amounts canbe absorbed through the skin. Based on data describing the rate of n-butylalcohol uptake through the skin of dogs, DiVincenzo and Hamilton (1979,as cited in <T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology, </T3>3rd rev. ed., Vol.2C, pp. 4571-78, Clayton and Clayton 1982) suggested that direct contactof human hands with n-butyl alcohol for one hour results in an absorbeddose that is four times that resulting from inhalation of 50 ppm for onehour.The former OSHA limit of 100 ppm (TWA) was based on the studies of Tabershaw,Fahy, and Skinner (1944, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 76) and ofSmyth (1956/Ex. 1-759). These studies indicated that workers experiencedno narcotic or systemic effects at levels lower than 100 ppm. However,irritation has been reported in humans exposed to 24 ppm; this irritationbecame uncomfortable and was followed by headaches at 50 ppm (Nelson, Enge,Ross et al. 1943/Ex. 1-66).More recent data reported by Seitz (1972, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 76), Velasquez (1964, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 76), and Velasquez,Escobar, and Almaraz (1969/Ex. 1-1174) indicate serious exposure-relatedlong-term systemic effects on the auditory nerve and hearing loss (hypoacusia);the magnitude of the hearing loss was related to length of exposure. Nineof 11 workers exposed without hearing protection to 80 ppm for periodsof from 3 to 11 years displayed impaired hearing. This phenomenon was particularlyevident in younger workers (Velasquez 1964, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 76; Velasquez, Escobar, and Almaraz 1969/Ex. 1-1174).Three commenters, ConAgra (Ex. 3-635), the Motor Vehicle ManufacturersAssociation (MVMA) (Ex. 3-902), and ARCO (Tr. p. 3-237) submitted commentson n-butyl alcohol. Con Agra (Ex. 3-635) misinterpreted OSHA's discussionof a 1964 study (Velasquez, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 76) to meanthat OSHA attributed all hearing loss found in the workers in this studyto n-butyl alcohol exposure. ARCO (Tr. p. 3-237) also questioned n-butylalcohol's effect on hearing. In response to these commenters, OSHA notesthat n-butyl alcohol has been shown in many studies to damage the auditorynerve and further, that workplace noise may also have contributed to thehearing loss observed in these studies. The MVMA comment (Ex. 3-902) listsn-butyl alcohol as a substance for which rulemaking should be delayed,but provides no other details.OSHA finds that the former PEL of 100 ppm is not sufficiently protectiveagainst the acute effects associated with exposure to n-butyl alcohol;in addition, the possibility of auditory nerve damage from exposures belowthe 100-ppm level makes the former PEL inadequate. A skin notation is necessarybecause data in beagle dogs suggest that dermal contact with n-butyl alcoholcan result in a systemic dose greater than that obtained by inhalation(DiVincenzo and Hamilton 1979). The Agency is establishing a permissibleexposure limit of 50 ppm as a ceiling, with a skin notation, for n-butylalcohol. OSHA concludes that this limit will protect workers against thesignificant risks of possible vestibular and auditory nerve injury as wellas of headaches and irritation, which constitute material impairments ofhealth and are associated with exposure to this substance at levels abovethe new limit.<ITAG tagnum="71">CHLORINATED CAMPHENE (60 Percent)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 8001-35-2; Chemical Formula: C<T4>10</T4>H<T4>10</T4>Cl<T4>8</T4></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1078</ITAG>Previously, OSHA had a limit of 0.5 mg/m\3\, with a skin notation, forchlorinated camphene. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA limit of 0.5 mg/m\3\ anda TLV-STEL of 1 mg/m\3\ for chlorinated camphene (60 percent), with a skinnotation, and these were the limits proposed. The final rule retains the0.5-mg/m\3\ 8-hour TWA and the skin notation, and adds a 1-mg/m\3\ STELfor chlorinated camphene, an amber waxy solid with a pleasant, pine-likeodor.Chlorinated camphene has demonstrated a moderately high acute toxicityin animal studies (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 115). Toxic doses cause variedcentral nervous system effects, including nausea, muscle spasms, confusion,and convulsions (Hayes 1963/Ex. 1-982). Data indicate that rats and guineapigs show no significant effects at dietary levels of 800 ppm daily fora six-month period (Alderson Reporting Co., as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 115). Monkeys tolerate daily feeding at 10 ppm but show toxic symptomsafter two weeks' feeding at the 60-ppm level (Sosnierz, Szczurek, Knapek,and Kolodziejczyk 1972/Ex. 1-760). Although chlorinated camphene may accumulatein fatty tissues, it clears quickly when ingestion is terminated (Sosnierz,Szczurek, Knapek, and Kolodziejczyk 1972/Ex. 1-760).In humans, the acute lethal dose of chlorinated camphene is between 2 and7 grams, and a dose of 10 mg/kg causes nonfatal convulsions in some exposedindividuals. The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p.115) concludes that the acute toxicityof chlorinated camphene is equivalent to that of chlordane, for which thefatal human dose is estimated to be around 6 grams; the ACGIH TLV-TWA forchlordane is 0.5 mg/m\3\. One study of 25 human volunteers failed to revealtoxic responses to daily 30-minute exposures to 500 mg/m\3\ for 10 consecutivedays, followed by similar exposures for three consecutive days three weekslater (Shelansky 1947, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 115). There areno reports of occupational poisonings, and a review of the medical recordsof employees engaged in the manufacture and handling of chlorinated campheneshowed no ill effects in workers exposed for an average of 3.7 years (Frawley1972, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 115).NIOSH does not concur with OSHA's PELs for this substance; NIOSH believesthat chlorinated camphene is a potential occupational carcinogen and shouldhave lower exposure limits (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B; Tr. pp. 3-97, 3-98). Noother comments on the health effects of this substance were submitted tothe record.OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.5 mg/m\3\ TWA and adding a 15-minuteSTEL of 1.0 mg/m\3\ for this insecticide. The Agency's skin notation isretained. OSHA concludes that both a TWA and a STEL are required to protectexposed workers against the significant risks of bioaccumulation and neuropathicand systemic effects; the Agency finds that these effects constitute materialimpairments of health. The STEL ensures that TWA exposures will be maintainedunder good industrial hygiene control. <ITAG tagnum="71">DECABORANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 17702-41-9; Chemical Formula: B<T2>10</T2>H<T2>14</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1114</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for decaborane was 0.05 ppm TWA, with a skin notation.The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 0.05 ppm and a TLV-STEL of 0.15 ppm, also witha skin notation. The proposal retained the 8-hour TWA of 0.05 ppm and addeda 0.15-ppm STEL, with a skin notation, and the final rule establishes theselimits. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs that these limits are appropriate.Decaborane forms colorless crystals that are stable at ordinary temperaturesand have a pungent odor. The acute toxicity of decaborane is extremely high for small laboratoryanimals. The 40-hour LC<T2>50</T2>s for rats and mice are 46 and 12 ppm, respectively (Schechter1958/Ex. 1-363). Dermal LD<T2>50</T2>s for rabbits and rats are 71 and 740 mg/kg, respectively (Svirbely1954a/Ex. 1-385). Acute exposures to decaborane cause loss of coordination,convulsions, weakness, tremors, and hyperexcitability. Decaborane's primaryeffects are on the kidneys and liver. Studies of repeated exposures tothis substance suggest that the toxicity of decaborane is intermediatebetween that of pentaborane and diborane. The ability of decaborane topenetrate the skin is particularly notable, as is its toxicity to the centralnervous system in some species, e.g., rats and rabbits (Svirbely 1954a/Ex.1-385, 1954b/Ex. 1-530, and 1955/Ex. 1-386). Monkeys showed decreased abilityfor certain operant behaviors when injected with doses of 3 to 6 mg/kgdecaborane (Reynolds et al. 1964, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 169).Central nervous system toxicity has been observed in humans exposed occupationally(Krackow 1953/Ex. 1-344). No comments other than NIOSH's were receivedon the health effects of decaborane.OSHA is retaining its 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.05 ppm TWA and skin notation,and adding a 15-minute STEL of 0.15 ppm for decaborane. The Agency concludesthat these limits will provide protection against the significant risksof material health impairment in the form of neuropathy and kidney andliver damage possible in the absence of a short-term limit for decaborane.<ITAG tagnum="71">Di-sec-OCTYL PHTHALATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 117-81-7; Chemical Formula: C<T2>24</T2>H<T2>38</T2>O<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1116</ITAG>OSHA formerly had a limit of 5 mg/m\3\ TWA for di-sec-octyl phthalate.The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 5 mg/m\3\ and a TLV-STEL of 10 mg/m\3\, andthese are the limits that were proposed. In the final rule, OSHA is retainingthe 8-hour TWA limit of 5 mg/m\3\ and adding a 15-minute STEL of 10 mg/m\3\for this light-colored, viscous, odorless, combustible liquid. Di-sec-octyl phthalate (DEHP) is not acutely toxic in small laboratoryanimals via the oral route. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> reported for mice is 26.3 g/kg; for rats, it is 33.8 g/kg (Krauskopfet al. 1973/Ex. 1-495). No skin irritation or sensitization potential hasbeen demonstrated in either animals or humans, and the lethal dermal dosein rabbits is about 25 ml/kg (Singh, Lawrence, and Autian 1972/Ex. 1-436).Shaffer, Carpenter, and Smyth (1945/Ex. 1-369) and Lawrence (unpublisheddata, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 223) have reported deaths in ratsand chronic inflammation of the lung in mice exposed to DEHP at unspecifiedlevels. Long-term dietary toxicity studies in rats, guinea pigs, and dogs haveestablished a no-effect dose level of about 60 mg/kg/day, and no carcinogenicor histologic abnormalities were observed at this level (Gesler 1973/Ex.1-481). Higher doses were associated with growth retardation and increasedliver and kidney weights but not histologic abnormalities. Metabolic studieshave demonstrated that laboratory animals do not appreciably metabolizeDEHP (Dillingham and Autian 1973/Ex. 1-477). Teratogenicity studies inpregnant rats indicated that fertility is unaffected at doses of 0.1, 0.2,or 0.33 percent of the acute intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> dose for rats, although slight effects on embryonic and fetaldevelopment were observed in these animals; skeletal deformities were themost common teratogenic effects observed (Dillingham and Autian 1973/Ex.1-477). Mutagenic effects were observed at intravenous doses of one-third,one-half, and two-thirds of the acute LD<T2>50</T2>; these effects are consistent with DEPHP's ability to producedominant lethal mutations (Dillingham and Autian 1973/Ex. 1-477). A study of workers exposed to a mixture of the vapors of diethyl phthalate,dibutyl phthalate, and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate reported that exposuresto 1 to 6 ppm caused no peripheral polyneuritis (Raleigh, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 223). However, Russian investigators examined male andfemale workers exposed to between 1.7 and 66 mg/m\3\ of various combinationsof airborne phthalates (including butyl phthalate, higher aryl phthalates,dioctyl phthalate and others) and noted complaints of pain, numbness, andspasms in the upper and lower extremities after six to seven years of exposure.Polyneuritis was observed in 32 percent of the workers studied, and 78percent of these workers showed depression of vestibular receptors (Milkov,Aldyreva, Popova et al. 1973/Ex. 1-646). OSHA received a comment from the Chemical Manufacturers Association PhthalateEsters Program Panel (Ex. 3-900). Although the Panel did not oppose theproposed PEL for di-sec-octyl phthalate, it objected to this substance'scategorization as a neuropathic agent on the grounds that (1) confoundingexposures to tricresyl phosphate and vinyl chloride, which are known neurotoxicantsoccured in the study referenced in the NPRM; and (2) other studies (inhumans or animals) have not substantiated that this substance is neuropathic:<ITAG tagnum="21">Including [di-sec-octyl phthalate] in this category of compounds [i.e.,neuropathic agents] is not justified and could lead to improper labelingof the material or unwarranted regulations, and restrictions on the useof the material based on unfounded conclusions (Ex. 3-900, p. 1).</ITAG>In response to this comment, OSHA notes that the classfication scheme usedin the preamble to the proposed and final rules is not intended to haveregulatory implications. As explained earlier in the preamble, OSHA isusing this scheme simply to facilitate generic rulemaking; the variouscategories reflect the health endpoint used by the ACGIH or NIOSH as thepoint of reference in setting a limit. Most of the substances includedin this rulemaking produce multiple health effects and could be classifiedin more than a single health effects category. Di-sec-octyl phthalate isno exception, and exposure to this substance has been associated with liverdamage, testicular injury, and teratogenic and carcinogenic effects inexperimental animals, as well as with possible neuropathic effects.Another commenter, Lawrence H. Hecker of Abbott Laboratories feels thatthe STEL for di-sec-octyl phthalate is unwarranted (Ex. 3-678, p. 8). OSHAdisagrees with Dr. Hecker and finds that, for substances posing serioushealth hazards, such as those associated with di-sec-octyl phthalate exposure,the STEL further protects workers from the signficant adverise effectsthat could occur in the short-term excursions above the TWA limit permittedin the absence of a STEL. NIOSH concurs in OSHA's selection of limits for di-sec-octyl phthalatebut believes it should be designated as a potential occupational carcinogen(Ex. 8-47, Table N6A). On the other hand, the Chemical Manufacturers Association's(Ex. 140) analysis of the evidence for DEHP's carcinogenicity led the CMAto conclude that this substance is not a carcinogen. OSHA is aware of di-sec-octylphthalate's carcinogenic effects in experimental animals and notes thatIARC has determined that sufficient evidence exists to designate it asan animal-positive carcinogen. However, adequate data are not availableto evaluate the risk of cancer to humans. The Agency will continue to monitorthe scientific evidence for di-sec-octyl phthalate and will re-evaluatethis substance in the future if such evidence suggests that this is appropriate.In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour PEL of 5 mg/m3 and addinga 15-minute STEL of 10 mg/m3 for di-sec-octyl phthalate. The Agency concludesthat these limits together will protect workers from the significant risksof neuropathic, hepatic, and other systemic injuries, which constitutematerial health impairments and are associated with exposure to this substance.<ITAG tagnum="71">DICHLOROACETYLENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7572-29-4; Chemical Formula: C1C andCx.173; CC1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1123</ITAG>OSHA previously had no limit for dichloroacetylene. The ACGIH has a TLV-ceilingof 0.1 ppm for this liquid, which explodes upon boiling. OSHA proposeda ceiling limit of 0.1 ppm, and this is the limit established by the finalrule.In preliminary inhalation exposure studies, guinea pigs demonstrated a4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> of 20 ppm; death occured two or three days after exposure andwas caused by pulmonary edema. In rats, similar exposures to dichloroacetylenein the presence of 330 ppm of trichloroethylene indicated an LC<T2>50</T2> of 55 ppm (Siegal 1967, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.177). When dichloroacetylene was mixed with 9 parts of ether, the 4-hourLC<T2>50</T2> in rats was 219 ppm; in combination with 7 parts of trichloroethylene,the 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> in rats was 55 ppm; and exposure to dichloroacetylene with10 parts of trichloroethylene caused a 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> in guinea pigs of 15 ppm (Siegal, Jones, Coon, and Lyon 1971/Ex.1-371). In humans, dichloroacetylene exposure causes headache, loss of appetite,extreme nausea, and vomiting; it affects the trigeminal nerve and facialmuscles and exacerbates facial herpes. Disabling nausea was experiencedby approximately 85 percent of individuals exposed for prolonged periodsof time (not further specified) at concentrations from 0.5 to 1 ppm (Saunders1967/Ex. 1-361). A number of occupational fatalities have been attributedto exposure to dichloroacetylene (Humphrey and McClelland 1944/Ex. 1-491;Firth and Stuckey 1945, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 177). Humphreyand McClelland (1944/Ex. 1-491) reported 13 cases of cranial nerve palsy,nine of which had labial herpes, following exposure to dichloroacetylene.These patients also had symptions of nausea, headache, jaw pain, and vomiting.Autopsies of two of these fatalities revealed edema at the base of thebrain (Humphrey and McClelland 1944/Ex. 1-491).NIOSH concurs with OSHA's limit for dichloroacetylene but believes thatthis substance should be designated as a potential occupational carcinogen(Ex. 8-47, Table N6A). However, as explained elsewhere in the preamble,OSHA has decided not to designate substances specifically as carcinogenssince so many other organizations already do so. OSHA received no othercomments regarding the health effects of dichloroacetylene.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a ceiling limit of 0.1 ppm fordichloroacetylene. The Agency concludes that this limit will substantiallyreduce the significant risks of disabling nausea and serious systemic effectsposed to workers exposed to dichloroacetylene at the levels formerly permittedby the absence of any OSHA limit. OSHA finds that these health effectsconstitute material impairments of health.<ITAG tagnum="71">DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL METHYL ETHER</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 34590-94-8; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>OC<T2>3</T2>H<T2>6</T2>OC<T2>3</T2>H<T2>6</T2>OH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1149</ITAG>OSHA formerly had an 8-hour TWA limit of 100 ppm for dipropylene glycolmethyl ether (DPGME), with a skin notation. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWAof 100 ppm and a TLV-STEL of 150 ppm, with a skin notation, for this colorlessliquid with a mild, pleasant, ethereal odor and a bitter taste. OSHA proposedto retain the 8-hour permissible exposure limit of 100 ppm TWA, to adda 150-ppm STEL, and to retain the skin notation for dipropylene glycolmethyl ether. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs that these limits areappropriate, and the final rule establishes these limits.Intact dogs receiving intravenous injections of DPGME exhibited centralnervous system depression and died as a result of respiratory failure (Shidemanand Procita 1951/Ex. 1-667). Rowe and associates (1954/Ex. 1-435) reporteda single acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> for rats of 5.4 ml/kg. Even at the highest levels tested (notfurther specified), no single application of DPGME to the skin of rabbitswas lethal, although some narcosis and transient weight loss did occur.However, a significant number of deaths occurred in a group of rabbitstreated with 65 repeated dermal applications containing DPGME concentrationsof 3 ml/kg or higher during a 90-day period. Four animal species, includingthe monkey, were exposed repeatedly to seven-hour daily inhalation exposuresof between 300 and 400 ppm DPGME; the animals exhibited narcosis and changesin the lung and liver (Rowe, McCollister, Spencer et al. 1954/Ex. 1-435).Humans inhaling DPGME concentrations of 300 to 400 ppm judged this levelto be very disagreeable, but 100 ppm was tolerable and, in the opinionof the authors, was unlikely to produce organic injury (Rowe, McCollister,Spencer et al. 1954/Ex. 1-435). Patch tests on the skin of 250 human subjectsproduced neither irritation nor sensitization (ACG1H 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 221).Humans exposed to DPGME vapor concentrations at levels between 50 to 2000ppm experienced eye, nose, and throat irritation before the onset of CNSimpairment, which occurred at 1000 ppm in one of two subjects (Stewart,Baretta, Dodd, and Torkelson 1970/Ex. 1-379).NIOSH (Ex. 150, Comments on Dipropylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether) reportedthat it is developing a criteria document on the glycol ethers; NIOSH submittedrecent toxicity data on DPGME, including the following: rats and mice inhalingconcentrations of 50, 140, or 330 ppm DPGME six hours/day for nine daysshowed increased liver weights (at 50 and 140 ppm for the rat and at 330ppm for the mouse), but no effects were observed when rats inhaled 15,50, or 220 ppm DPGME six hours/day, five days/week for 13 weeks (Landryand Yano 1984, as cited in Ex. 150). NIOSH also reported results of a 1985study by Miller et al. indicating that DPGME is metabolized via the sameroutes to the same types of metabolites_propylene glycol, and sulfate andglucuronide conjugates of DPGME_as previously identified for PGME (1-methoxy-2-propanol)(Miller, Hermann, Calhoun et al. 1985, as cited in Ex. 150). The Landryand Yano study (1984, as cited in Ex. 150) further indicated that at theconcentrations tested, DPGME exerted no teratogenic or reproductive effects(NIOSH/Ex. 150, Comments on Dipropylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether).The ARCO Chemical Company (Ex. 3-740) questioned the appropriateness ofa skin notation for this substance. In response to ARCO, the Agency notesthat DPGME, applied essentially according to the Draize method, is absorbedin sufficient quantities through rabbit skin to cause transient narcosis,although the absorption rate was not considered acutely dangerous (<T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology,</T3> 3rd rev. ed., Vol.2C, p. 3990, Clayton and Clayton 1982). Topical administration of 10 mg/kgDPGME five times per week for 13 weeks to shaved rabbit skin caused sixdeaths among seven animals (<T3>Chemical Hazards of the Workplace,</T3> 2nd ed., p. 221, Proctor, Hughes,and Fischman, 1988). To date, there are no human data demonstrating thatdermal contact with DPGME is without a significant adverse health risk;therefore, in accordance with the policy described in Section VI.C.18,OSHA finds that the available evidence does not meet the criterion fordeleting an existing skin notation.In the final rule, OSHA is retaining a PEL of 100 ppm TWA and adding aSTEL of 150 ppm for dipropylene glycol methyl ether; the skin notationis retained. The Agency concludes that this combined limit will substantiallyreduce the significant risks of central nervous system effects and irritation,which constitute material health impairments, that exist when workers areexposed to DPGME for short periods above the 100-ppm PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">n-HEXANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 110-54-3; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>(CH<T2>2</T2>)<T2>4</T2>CH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1200</ITAG>OSHA's former PEL for n-hexane was 500 ppm. The ACGIH has a 50-ppm TWAlimit for this substance, and the NIOSH REL is 100 ppm as a 10-hour TWA.OSHA proposed a limit of 50 ppm TWA for n-hexane, and the final rule establishesthis limit. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs that a PEL of 50 ppm isappropriate for n-hexane. Normal hexane is a clear, volatile liquid.n-Hexane has been shown to produce distal axonopathy in both experimentalanimals and humans; it is metabolized to 2,5-hexanedione (2,5-HD), whichis thought to be the causative agent of most of the adverse neurologicaleffects observed after exposure to hexane (Schaumburg, Spencer, and Thomas1983/Ex. 1-228).In the preamble to the proposed rule, OSHA asked:<ITAG tagnum="21">Does the most current scientific information generally support acceptanceof the hypothesis that the C<T2>5^8</T2> alkanes are not equally toxic because a metabolite of n-hexaneexhibits unique neurotoxic properties?</ITAG>Several commenters (Exs. 3-593, 3-1246, and 124; Tr. III, pp. 109-110)responded to this question, and their detailed responses are discussedin Section V of this preamble, Summary of Commenters' Responses to NPRMQuestions.The C<T2>5^8</T2> alkanes include pentane, n-hexane, the hexane isomers, n-heptane,octane, and the refined petroleum solvents. Whether all of these alkanesexhibit the same degree of toxicity or whether one (or more) is uniquelytoxic has a direct bearing on the appropriate exposure limits for thesesubstances. Based on a thorough review of the chemical and toxicologicalliterature and the responses of these commenters, OSHA has determined thatn-hexane is uniquely toxic to the peripheral nervous system. The Agencyfinds that 2,5-hexanedione (2,5-HD), a metabolite of n-hexane, is likelyto be responsible for this unique toxicity, and the American PetroleumInstitute (Ex. 124) agrees with this finding. NIOSH (Tr. III, pp. 109-110),on the other hand, is of the opinion that any ketone or related chemicalthat can be metabolized to a gamma diketone has the potential to causeperipheral neuropathy. However, representatives of the Texaco Company (Ex.3-1246) agree with OSHA that n-hexane is uniquely toxic because its toxicityis mediated by 2,5-HD.The ACGIH established a TLV of 50 ppm for this substance, based primarilyon studies (Miyagaki 1967/Ex. 1-198; Inoue, Takeuchi, Takeuchi et al. 1970/Ex.1-75) showing peripheral neuropathies at exposure levels as low as 210ppm. NIOSH based its 100-ppm REL on the same studies as those cited bythe ACGIH (Miyagaki 1967/Ex. 1-198; Inoue, Takeuchi, Takeuchi et al. 1970/Ex.1-75). NIOSH reasoned as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The absence of definitive epidemiologic or toxicologic evidence makesit difficult to determine how much lower the environmental limit shouldbe. Professional judgment suggests [that] a TWA concentration of 350 mg/m3(100 ppm) offers a sufficient margin of safety to protect against the developmentof chronic nerve disorders in workers (NIOSH 1977a/Ex. 1-233, p. 74).</ITAG>The adverse neurological effects of hexane exposure are manifested as bothsensory and motor dysfunctions. Initially, there is a symmetric sensorynumbness of the hands and feet, with loss of pain, touch, and heat sensation.Motor weakness of the toes and fingers is often present; as the neuropathybecomes more severe, weakness of the muscles of the arms and legs may alsobe observed (Schaumburg, Spencer, and Thomas 1983/Ex. 1-228). There areno known conditions that predispose an individual to hexane neurotoxicity(Schaumburg, Spencer, and Thomas 1983/Ex. 1-228). The onset of neurologicalsymptoms may not be evident for several months to a year after the beginningof exposure. Recovery may be complete, but severely exposed individualsoften retain some degree of sensorimotor deficit.OSHA received comments on n-hexane from several participants, includingNIOSH, the National Cotton Council, the American Petroleum Institute, theCorn Refiners Association, the AFL-CIO, and the United Auto Workers. Twocommenters, the National Cotton Council (Tr. pp. 9-45 to 9-47) and theCorn Refiners Association (Ex. 177), stated that the revised PEL for n-hexanewould impact their members, but did not provide further detail.Some commenters (Exs. 194 and 197: Tr. pp. 3-290 to 3-293) urged OSHA toregulate all of the refined petroleum solvents on the basis of neurotoxicity.For example, the AFL-CIO recommended a 10-ppm PEL for all such solvents,and Dr. Franklin Mirer of the United Auto Workers described feasible controlsthat could be used, in his opinion, to achieve this level. Dr. Philip Landrigan(Tr. pp. 3-290 to 3-293) described the neurotoxic effects of exposure toany of the refined petroleum solvents. In response to these commenters,OSHA notes that it is reducing the limits for a number of these solventsin this rulemaking; however, the scale of this undertaking is such thatOSHA was unable to perform the detailed analysis necessary to evaluatethe health effects, risks, and feasibility for all of the solvents in thislarge group of substances.The dose-response relationship for n-hexane exposure in humans is not welldefined, although it is clear that the severity of the resulting neuropathyincreases as the exposure level of n-hexane increases. A number of studieshave shown a consistent relationship between exposure levels of 500 ppm(OSHA's former exposure limit) to 2000 ppm and the development of characteristicperipheral neuropathies (Yamamura 1969, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 305; Yamada 1967/Ex. 1-192). Neuropathic effects have also been shownto occur at levels between 210 and 500 ppm (Takeuchi, Maluchi, and Takagi1975/Ex. 1-217).Reports of effects occurring at levels of 210 to 500 ppm indicate thatthe former OSHA PEL of 500 ppm was not adequate to protect exposed workersfrom adverse sensorimotor neuropathic effects, and exposure at this levelthus represents a significant risk to workers. The decreased sensitivityto pain, touch, and temperature associated with n-hexane exposure can alsomake a worker more susceptible to injuries and accidents. Further, thedelayed onset of a clinical response, which is typical of hexane exposure,increases the probability that exposure will continue until irreversibleeffects occur. Both the presence of peripheral neuropathies at 210 ppm and the delay inonset of neurological symptoms indicate that workers exposed at levelsabove the new limit are at significant risk of developing these symptoms.OSHA therefore establishes a PEL of 50 ppm TWA for n-hexane. The Agencyconcludes that this PEL will substantially reduce the significant riskof peripheral neurophathies and other adverse neuropathic effects, whichconstitute material impairments of health and are associated with the exposurespermitted at levels above the new limit. <ITAG tagnum="71">2-HEXANONE (METHYL n-BUTYL KETONE)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 591-78-6; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CO-CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. NO. 1202</ITAG>OSHA's former PEL for 2-hexanone was 100 ppm TWA; the NIOSH REL is a 1ppm (10-hour) TWA; and the ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 5 ppm. The Agencyproposed, and the final rule establishes, a permissible exposure limitof 5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA for 2-hexanone. 2-Hexanone is a colorless, volatileliquid with a characteristic acetone-like odor that is more pungent thanthat of acetone. Industrial exposure to 2-hexanone causes distal neuropathy manifestingas interference with motor and sensory function; even in cases characterizedby minimal intensity, electrodiagnostic abnormalities were seen (ACGIH1987/Ex. 1-16). In animals, exposure to 2-hexanone causes axonal swellingand thinning of the myelin sheath. A metabolite of 2-hexanone, 2,5-hexanedione,appears to be responsible for the neural damage; this same metabolite isformed when n-hexane (discussed above) is metabolized. Exposures of rats,cats, dogs, monkeys, hens, and guinea pigs to 2-hexanone have resultedin peripheral neuropathies (O'Donoghue 1985). Krasavage, O'Donoghue, andTerhaar (1978) reported that 2,5-hexanedione is 3.3 times more neurotoxicthan 2-hexanone and 38 times more neurotoxic than n-hexane in rats. Thus,2-hexanone would be approximately eleven times more neurotoxic than n-hexanein rats. The limit of 5 ppm TWA for 2-hexanone recommended by the ACGIH is basedon the results of several studies. These include studies showing evidenceof peripheral neuropathy at levels of 50 ppm and above after exposureslasting six months or more (Johnson, Anger, Setzer et al. 1979/Ex. 1-984;Streletz, Duckett, and Chambers 1976/Ex. 1-1067). Another study identified2,5-hexanedione (the metabolite believed responsible for neurotoxic effects)in the serum of humans after a one-day exposure to 50 ppm (DiVincenzo,Kaplan, and Dedinas 1976/Ex. 1-1049). The NIOSH REL for 2-hexanone of 1 ppm (10-hour TWA) is based on an epidemiologicstudy describing an outbreak of neurologic disease among workers in a plantthat manufactures printed fabrics (Allen, Mendall, Billmaier et al. 1975/Ex.1-80). This study reported that a screening of 1,157 exposed workers revealed86 verified cases of distal neuropathy. 2-Hexanone was suspected of beingthe neurotoxicant because it had only recently been introduced into theprocess (Allen, Mendall, Billmaier et al. 1975/Ex. 1-80). When recommendingits limit, NOISH relied on an industrial hygiene survey of the plant conductedby Billmaier, Yee, Allen et al. (Ex. 1-76) in 1974, which showed that 2-hexanoneconcentrations near the textile printing machines ranged from 1 to 156ppm (10-minute area samples). After reviewing this evidence, NIOSH concludedthat 1 ppm could not be considered a no-effect level for 2-hexanone-inducedneuropathy, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N2; Tr. p. 3-86) continues to recommenda limit of 1 ppm TWA for 2-hexanone. The AFL-CIO (Ex. 194) also supportsthe adoption of the lower NIOSH REL. Dr. Franklin Mirer of the AFL-CIO(Ex. 197) described controls for use in workplaces where solvents presentexposure problems. The ACGIH (1987/Ex. 1-16) stated that interpretation of the results ofthe Billmaier, Yee, Allen et al. (1974/Ex. 1-76) study was complicatedbecause the exposure measurements reported in the study had been takenafter the outbreak of neuropathic effects had occurred. In addition, theACGIH pointed out that Billmaier and colleagues (1974/Ex. 1-76) found poorwork practices at the plant (gloves were rarely used, employees washedtheir hands with solvent, etc.); thus, dermal exposures may have contributedsubstantially to the outbreak. Both human and animal studies show the development of disease at exposurelevels well below the former 100-ppm PEL, clearly indicating the need toreduce this significant risk. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a5-ppm (8-hour TWA) PEL for 2-hexanone. The Agency concludes that this limitwill substantially reduce the significant risk of distal neuropathy, whichconstitutes a material impairment of health and has been demonstrated tooccur at concentrations above the new limit. <ITAG tagnum="71">IRON PENTACARBONYL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 13463-40-6; Chemical Formula: Fe(CO)<T2>5</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIHhas a TLV-TWA of 0.1 ppm with a TLV-STEL of 0.2 ppm, measured as iron,for this highly flammable, oily, colorless to yellow liquid. The Agencyproposed, and the final rule establishes, permissible exposure limits of0.1 ppm TWA and 0.2 ppm STEL for iron pentacarbonyl, measured as Fe. NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs that these limits are appropriate.In studies of rats, iron pentacarbonyl has been reported to have approximatelyone-third the acute toxicity of nickel carbonyl (for which the ACGIH hasrecommended a TLV of 0.05 ppm TWA) (Sunderman, West, and Kincaid 1959/Ex.1-384). In 1970, Gage found that a 5.5-hour exposure at 33 ppm caused fatalitiesin three of eight rats; four of eight animals died after two 5.5-hour exposuresat 18 ppm. At 7 ppm, no ill effects were observed in rats exposed 18 timesin 5.5 hours (Gage 1970/Ex. 1-318). There are no reports of long-term dose-responseexposure studies in laboratory animals, and no evidence exists that ironpentacarbonyl is carcinogenic in either humans or animals (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 327). Immediate symptoms of acute exposure to high concentrations of iron pentacarbonylinclude headache and dizziness, followed in 12 to 36 hours by fever, cyanosis,cough, and shortness of breath. Another clinical effect of overexposureto this substance is lung injury, and degenerative changes in the centralnervous system have also been reported (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 327). Nocomments (other than NIOSH's) on the health effects of iron pentacarbonylwere submitted to the rulemaking record. In the final rule, OSHA establishes a permissible exposure limit of 0.1ppm TWA and a STEL of 0.2 ppm for iron pentacarbonyl. The Agency concludesthat these limits will protect workers from the significant risks of materialhealth impairment in the form of headache, dizziness, fever, dyspnea, cyanosis,pulmonary injury, and central nervous system effects, which are potentiallyassociated with exposures at levels above the new limits. <ITAG tagnum="71">MANGANESE FUME </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7439-96-5; Chemical Formula: MnO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Health surveys of employees exposedto manganese fume have demonstrated a high incidence of pneumonia in theseworkers (Davies 1946, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 354).

Those workers exposed to fume levelsbelow 5 mg/m3 exhibited no signs of pneumonia.

OSHA does not agree with the views of this commenter, becauseexposures to these fumes have been demonstrated to cause toxic effectsin both humans and animals. Workers exposed to manganese fumes developedpneumonia (Tanaka and Lieben 1969/Ex. 1-388), and Stokinger (1981f, in<T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology, </T3>3rd rev. ed., Vol.2A, p. 1767) reports that the 1-mg/m3 limit ``is supported by the findingin animals that the higher oxides are more toxic, and the report of anoccasional case of Mn poisoning in susceptible workers exposed to ferroMn fumes around the 1-mg/m3 limit.'' Based on a review of all of the record evidence, the final rule establishesa 1-mg/m3 TWA and a 3-mg/m3 STEL for manganese fume. The Agency concludesthat both a TWA limit and a STEL are required to protect employees fromthe significant risks of manganese poisoning, lung damage, and pneumonia,all of which constitute material health impairments, associated with exposureto these fumes.<ITAG tagnum="71">MANGANESE CYCLOPENTADIENYL TRICARBONYL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 12079-65-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>5</T2>H<T2>5</T2>_Mn(CO)<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The Agency proposed, and the final rule establishes, apermissible exposure limit of 0.1 mg/m3 TWA (measured as manganese), witha skin notation, for this substance. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concursthat these limits are appropriate.A Russian study reported that a single two-hour exposure to MCT at 120mg/m3 was fatal to 80 percent of albino rats, although rabbits, guineapigs, and rats survived a single two-hour exposure at 20 to 40 mg/m3. Chronicexposure of rats for 11 months at levels averaging 1 mg/m3 for four hoursdaily showed delayed effects (seven months from onset of exposure) of neuromuscularexcitability, evidence of kidney damage, and decreased resistance to infection(Arkhipova, Tolgskaya, and Kochetkova 1965/Ex. 1-1046). The tails of 10white mice were dipped in a gasoline mixture containing 1 gram MCT per100 ml; a second group of mice had their tails immersed in gasoline withoutMCT. An equal number of fatalities were observed in the gasoline plus MCTand gasoline-only groups after four or five two-hour applications, andall tails exhibited necrosis. The authors concluded that these effectswere caused by the gasoline and not by the MCT (Arkhipova, Tolgskaya, andKochetkova 1965/Ex. 1-1046). Further studies in rabbits showed that MCTapplied dermally as an oil emulsion caused irritation of the skin. Theseauthors also investigated the dermal toxicity of MCT solutions in tetrahydrofuranversus solutions of tetrahydrofuran in oil. All animals whose tails hadbeen dipped in the hydrofuran solution of MCT died within an hour, whileanimals whose tails had been dipped in pure tetrahydrofuran did not (Arkhipova,Tolgskaya, and Kochetkova 1965/Ex. 1-1046). The same authors concludedthat MCT is toxic at low concentrations, has cumulative properties, affectsthe nervous system, is irritating to the skin, and causes early histologicalchanges in the respiratory tract.More recent reports describe MCT-induced pulmonary edema and convulsionsin the rat (Penney, Hogberg, Traiger, and Hanzlik 1985/Ex. 1-431). TheED<T2>50s</T2> for convulsions were 32 mg/kg orally and 20 mg/kg intraperitoneally;LD<T2>50s</T2> were 24 mg/kg orally and 14 mg/kg intraperitoneally. Necrosisof the bronchiolar tissue and pulmonary parenchymal damage were seen inmice and rats given intraperitoneal doses (Haschek, Hakkinen, Witschi etal. 1982/Ex. 1-1083). No comments other than NIOSH's werre received onMCT. OSHA has concluded that occupational exposure to MCT poses a risk of neuropathiceffects, kidney damage, skin irritation, pulmonary edema, and tissue damage,which together constitute material health impairments. The Agency is thereforeestablishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.1 mg/m3 for manganese cyclopentadienyltricarbonyl, with a skin notation, to protect workers against the significantrisk of these effects, which have been shown to occur at levels above thenew standard.<ITAG tagnum="71">MANGANESE TETROXIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1317-35-7; Chemical Formula: Mn<T2>3</T2>O<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1238</ITAG>OSHA previously had no exposure limit for manganese tetroxide (compoundand fume). The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 1 mg/m3, measured as manganese,for this brownish-black powder and its dust and fume. The Agency proposeda PEL of 1 mg/m3 TWA for manganese tetroxide, measured as Mn, and the finalrule establishes this limit. Ferromanganese fume has been determined byX-ray diffraction analysis to consist primarily of manganese tetroxide.Findings from a Russian study indicated that intratracheal suspensionsof manganese oxide, manganese dioxide, and manganese tetroxide particles(particle size less than 3 mm) produced pneumonitis and other similar pulmonaryeffects in rats (Levina and Robachevskiau 1955/Ex. 1-1041). These investigatorsalso determined that manganese tetroxide has a greater toxicity than dothe lower oxides of manganese and that freshly prepared oxides were morepotent than those stored for six months to one year.Two cases of manganese fume poisoning were reported in a plant where concentrationswere between 2.7 and 4.7 mg/m\3\ (Whitlock, Amuso, and Bittenbender 1966/Ex.1-455), but other investigators have questioned these air sampling resultsand believe that exposures to manganese tetroxide concentrations of 5 mg/m\3\or less cause no harmful effects (Whitman and Brandt 1966/Ex. 1-1103).In a seven-year study, Smyth and co-workers (1973/Ex. 1-990) investigatedchronic manganese poisoning in workers exposed to both ferromanganese fumesand dust. Five of 71 employees suffered from chronic manganism; of thesefive cases, three resulted from fume exposure and two from dust exposure.Two of the three fume-exposure victims were exposed over a five-year periodto an estimated average ferromanganese concentration of 13.3 mg/m\3\; however,the third victim worked in an operation where air concentrations of manganesewere less than 1 mg/m\3\, which suggests that certain individuals may behypersusceptible to manganese poisoning. The dust-exposed victims workedin areas where air concentrations were in the range of 30 to 50 mg/m\3\throughout the study period (Smyth, Ruhf, Whitman, and Dugan 1973/Ex. 1-990).Martonik (1976, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-13, p. 357) reported thatthe fume of manganese has greater toxicity than does the dust. During atwo-year period, at least one case of acute manganese poisoning was documentedat a fume concentration level of 7.5 mg/m\3\, and another case at the samewelding operation may also have involved manganism.OSHA received two comments on this substance, one from NIOSH (Ex. 8-47;Tr. p. 3-86), and one from Chemetals, a manganese manufacturer (Ex. 3-189).NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N2) does not concur with the limits being establishedby OSHA. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N2) notes that, based on the results ofthe Smyth and co-workers study (1973/Ex. 1-990), the 1-mg/m\3\ PEL beingestablished by OSHA ``may not be protective, especially to the potentiallysensitive individual.'' In response to this NIOSH comment, OSHA statesthat the Agency intends to monitor the literature on manganese tetroxideclosely in the future to determine whether the new limit for this substanceis adequately protective.Chemetals (Ex. 3-189) asked OSHA to promulgate separate limits for thedust and fume of manganese tetroxide based on the relative toxicities ofthese two particulate forms. OSHA recognizes that some information in theliterature (including some discussed above) points to the greater toxicityof the fume and that fumes are generally the more toxic form of particulate.However, the Agency notes that intratracheal suspensions of manganese tetroxidedust caused pneumonitis and other pulmonary effects in Russian workers(Levina and Robachevskiau 1955/Ex. 1-1041) and that several cases of manganismhave been caused by dust exposure (Smyth, Ruhf, Whitman, and Anger 1973/Ex.1-990). The Agency believes it prudent not to distinguish at this timebetween the dust and the fume but to set the TWA PEL at a level that willprotect against the effects of exposure to both forms of particulate.OSHA is establishing a 1-mg/m\3\ 8-hour TWA for manganese tetroxide (compoundand fume). The Agency concludes that this limit will provide protectionagainst the significant risks of material health impairment in the formof chronic manganese poisoning, pneumonitis, and other respiratory effectsthat are associated with exposure to manganese tetroxide at levels above1 mg/m\3\.<ITAG tagnum="71">MERCURY (ARYL AND INORGANIC COMPOUNDS)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7439-97-6; Chemical Formula: Hg</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1240</ITAG>The former OSHA limit for all inorganic forms of mercury (Hg) was 0.1 mg/m\3\as a ceiling limit, as indicated on Table Z-2; this limit was adopted fromANSI standard Z37.8 (1943). In a compliance directive issued in 1978 (OSHAInstruction CPL 2-2.6), however, the Agency stated that the PEL for inorganicmercury should be expressed as an 8-hour TWA of 1 mg/10 m\3\ (0.1 mg/m\3\)rather than as a ceiling. The ACGIH has a 0.1-mg/m\3\ TLV-TWA for aryland inorganic mercury compounds. NIOSH (1973b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 358) has recommended a 0.05-mg/m\3\ limit as an 8-hour TWA. OSHAproposed to return to its 0.1-mg/m\3\ ceiling limit (measured as mercury)and this limit is being established, together with a skin notation, inthe final rule. This action cancels the 1978 compliance directive.In 1971, shortly after OSHA had adopted the 0.1-mg/m\3\ ceiling, the ACGIHreduced the TLV-TWA for all forms of mercury, including the inorganic compounds,to 0.05 mg/m\3\. ANSI also reduced its standard to 0.05 mg/m\3\ in 1972,and NIOSH recommended the same limit in 1973. The 0.05-mg/m\3\ limit wasbased largely on the study of Smith, Vorwald, Patil, and Mooney (1970/Ex. 1-373) of workers exposed to mercury levels ranging from less than0.1 to 0.27 mg/m\3\ in chlor-alkali plants. The authors reported a significantdose-related increase in the incidence of weight loss, tremors, abnormalreflexes, nervousness, and insomnia among workers exposed to concentrationsof 0.1 mg/m\3\ or more. There were slight increases in incidences of insomniaand loss of appetite among workers exposed to 0.1 mg/m\3\ or less. Smith,Vorwald, Patil, and Mooney (1970/Ex. 1-373) concluded that a limit of 0.1mg/m\3\ contained little or no margin of safety. Other studies (Bidstrup,Bonnell, Harvey, and Locket 1951/Ex. 1-1014; Turrian, Grandjean, and Turrian1956, as cited in ACGIH 1986/ Ex.1-3, p. 358) have also reported symptomsof mercury poisoning among workers exposed below 0.1 mg/m\3\. The 0.05-mg/m\3\limit established by the ACGIH, ANSI, and NIOSH also follows the 1968 recommendationof an international committee (Permanent Commission andamp; InternationalAssociation on Occupational Health 1968, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 358).In 1980, the ACGIH revised its recommended TLV for aryl and inorganic mercurycompounds to 0.1 mg/m\3\. In revising this limit, the ACGIH cited discrepanciesin the literature regarding the ratio of blood and urinary mercury levelsto airborne concentrations of mercury (Bell, Lovejoy, and Vizena 1973/Ex.1-1078; Stopford et al. 1978/Ex. 1-1100). These studies reported lowerratios of mercury body burden to airborne concentration when personal samplingis used rather than area sampling. According to Bell, Lovejoy, and Vizena(1973/Ex. 1-1078), the lower ratio results because mercury exposure measurementsare generally found to be higher when personal sampling is conducted, presumablyas a consequence of contamination of clothing. The ACGIH argued that the0.05-mg/m\3\ limit may be too stringent to apply when personal samplingis conducted. The ACGIH also stated that, in contrast to the effects ofelemental or alkyl mercury, little mercury is deposited in the brain followingexposure to aryl or inorganic mercury compounds. Based on this reasoning,the ACGIH adopted the higher 0.1-mg/m\3\ TLV-TWA for aryl and inorganiccompounds of mercury. However, the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 358) also notedthat, although central nervous system effects are less likely to occurfrom exposure to mercury salts than from other forms of mercury, the riskof renal and oral effects would ``presumably be just as great.'' Therefore,they cautioned that the higher limit for mercury salts ``may be subjectto debate'' (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 358).Robert G. Smerko, President of the Chlorine Institute (Ex. 3-828; Tr. pp.10-171 to 10-177), reviewed the pharmacologic evidence on the various formsof mercury. He concluded that, contrary to the statement by the ACGIH,there is little difference in brain deposition between elemental mercuryand mercury compounds: <ITAG tagnum="21">The ACGIH differentiated between aryl mercury and inorganic saltsof mercury in comparison with elemental mercury vapor * * *.

This issue is discussed below, formercury vapor. In light of this information, which counters the basis for the 0.1-mg/m\3\ACGIH TLV, and given the caution expressed by the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 358) that the 0.1-mg/m\3\ TWA limit ``may be subject to debate,'' OSHAconcludes that the PEL for aryl and inorganic mercury should be 0.1 mg/m\3\as a ceiling limit, as indicated in Table Z-2. The health studies citedabove indicate that reducing the limit for these forms of mercury willensure that employees are not at significant risk of adverse neuropathiceffects from exposure to these forms of mercury and their compounds. Accordingly,OSHA is establishing a 0.1-mg/m\3\ ceiling limit (measured as mercury)for aryl and inorganic mercury and compounds. Dr. Grace Ziem (Ex. 46) supportedlowering the mercury limit in the final rule, and the Workers Institutefor Safety and Health urged OSHA to restore the ceiling (Ex. 116). OSHAis also adding a skin notation to alert employers to the fact that mercuryreadily penetrates the skin, causing systemic poisoning; several casesof poisoning from this route have been reported (NIOSH 1973b, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 358; Ex. 3-828). One commenter, Stuart B. Cooper, Manager of Regulatory Affairs for CosanChemical Corporation (Ex. 3-1162), expressed concern that establishingdifferent PELs for inorganic mercury and elemental mercury vapor wouldconfuse the interpretation of monitoring results in cases in which morethan one form of mercury is present. He suggested that, where one formof mercury is present to a greater extent than another form, only the PELfor the predominant form should apply. OSHA agrees that, for some workplaces,such an approach may be reasonable; however, since the limits for inorganicmercury and mercury vapor differ, both in numerical value and requiredsampling duration, OSHA believes that employers may wish to conduct bothceiling and full-shift air sampling in cases where both forms of mercuryare present. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a PEL of 0.1 mg/m\3\ as a ceilingfor aryl mercury and the inorganic compounds of mercury, along with a skinnotation. The Agency concludes that these limits are necessary to protectexposed workers from the significant risks of neuropathy and systemic toxicity(both of which constitute material impairments of health) that are associatedwith exposure to these substances at higher levels. <ITAG tagnum="71">MERCURY (VAPOR) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7439-97-6; Chemical Formula; Hg </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1241 </ITAG>OSHA formerly had a TWA limit of 0.1 mg/m\3\ for mercury (including vapor).The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 0.05 mg/m\3\ for mercury vapor, measuredas mercury, and a skin notation. NIOSH has a REL of 0.05 mg/m\3\ as an8-hour TWA. The Agency proposed a PEL of 0.05.mg/m\3\ TWA mercury and itsvapor, measured as Hg, and the final rule establishes this limit, alsowith a skin notation. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs that this limitis appropriate. Elemental mercury is a silvery, oderless, heavy liquid.Inhalation of high concentrations of mercury vapor for relatively briefperiods can cause pneumonitis, bronchitis, chest pain, dyspnea, coughing,stomatitis, gingivitis, salivation, and diarrhea (NIOSH 1973b, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 359; Ashe, Largent, Dutra et al. 1953/Ex. 1-502).Chronic mercurialism is manifested by central nervous system effects, includingtremor, a variety of neuropsychiatric disturbances, and loss of appetite(Kazantzis 1968, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 359; Smith, Vorwald,Patil, and Mooney 1970/Ex. 1-373). Severe organ damage occurred in rabbits exposed for four hours to an averagevapor concentration of 28.8 mg/m\3\. Damage was observed in the kidneys,liver, brain, heart, lungs, and colon (Ashe, Largent, Dutra et al. 1953/Ex.1-502). A study by Smith, Vorwald, Patil, and Mooney (1970/Ex. 1-373) of567 male workers exposed to a mean exposure level of 0.065 mg/m\3\ (S.D.andplusmin; 0.085) showed a significant dose-related increase in the incidenceof weight loss, tremors, abnormal reflexes, nervousness, and insomnia amongworkers exposed to 0.1 mg/m\3\ or higher. There were slight increases inthe incidence of insomnia and loss of appetite among workers exposed to0.1 mg/m\3\ or less. Smith, Vorwald, Patil, and Mooney (1970/Ex. 1-373)concluded that a limit of 0.1 mg/m\3\ contained little or no margin ofsafety. Six of 75 workers regularly exposed to 0.05 to 0.1 mg/m\3\ of mercuryvapor in a glassware manufacturing plant reported insomnia, and one wasfound to have tremors (Danziger and Possick 1973/Ex. 1-504). One of 11workers, employed in a mercury mine or refining plant and exposed at vaporconcentrations below 0.1 mg/m\3\ had sore gums, loose teeth, or excesssalivation (Rentos and Seligman 1968/Ex. 1-523). NIOSH (1973b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 358) has recommended a10-hour TWA limit of 0.05 mg/m\3\ for inorganic mercury and concluded thathyperactivity, rather than tremor, may be the most typical symptom of chronicmercurialism. Two studies report no evidence of mercury vapor poisoningin industrial settings where characteristic exposures ranged between 0.05and 0.1 mg/m\3\ (Danziger and Possick 1973/Ex. 1-504; McGill, Ladd, Jacobs,and Goldwater 1964/Ex. 1-520). In workers exposed at levels above 0.1 mg/m\3\, toxic symptoms were seen(Rentos and Seligman 1968/Ex.1-523). Turrian, Grandjean, and Turrian (1956,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 358) found that 33 percent of workersexposed to the vapor at levels above 0.05 mg/m\3\ exhibited hyperexcitability,while only 8 percent of those exposed below that level manifested thissymptom. About 20 percent of workers in both groups exhibited tremor. TheACGIH notes that, after exposure to the vapor, ``a relatively high percentageof the absorbed mercury remains in the brain,'' compared with the amountdeposited in the brain after exposure to the aryl and inorganic compounds(ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 359). The ACGIH accordingly recommends a higherTLV-TWA for aryl and inorganic mercury then for mercury vapor (see, however,the discussion of aryl and inorganic mercury above).Robert G. Smerko, President of the Chlorine Institute (Ex. 3-828), andthe Laboratory Products Association (Ex. 135) urged OSHA to retain its0.1-mg/m\3\ PEL and to require urinary mercury analysis in lieu of a reducedPEL because dermal contact with mercury may contribute substantially toits toxicity (Ex. 3-828; Tr. pp. 10-171 to 10-177). Mr. Smerko cited severalreports of such effects in his testimony and submission, including reportsof poisoning resulting from contact with contaminated clothing. Becausedermal contact is a significant route of exposure for mercury, Mr. Smerkocommented:<ITAG tagnum="21">There is a large probability that air measurements of mercury concentrations(aryl mercury, inorganic salts, or elemental mercury vapor) either overestimateor underestimate the extent of exposure to mercury. The extreme accuracyand precision of the urinary mercury analysis and the amount of work thathas been done in correlating urinary mercury concentrations with the presenceor absence of effects from exposure to mercury warrant the propsal thata biological standard, or a comprehensive standard that includes an airconcentration and urinary mercury concentration, be established for arylmercury, inorganic salts of mercury, and elemental mercury vapor (Ex. 3-828,p. 9).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Mr. Robert F. Adams, Senior Industrial Hygienist for Occidental ChemicalCorporation (Ex. 3-1174), supported the position of the Chlorine Instituteon this issue, as did Dr. James Melius of the New York State Departmentof Health (Tr. pp. 11-105, 11-106, 11-109 to 11-111).OSHA agrees that prevention of mercury contamination of skin and clothing,as well as the proper handling of contaminated clothing, are essentialelements of a program to protect employees from the health hazards of mercury.OSHA also believes that mercury presents one of the rare instances in whicha biological-monitoring-based standard may represent an effective and reasonableapproach for ensuring worker protection. Margaret Seminario, AssociateDirector of Occupational Safety, Health, and Social Security for the AFL-CIO,also supported provisions for biological monitoring of mercury (Ex. 194,Appendix 1, p. 3). However, developing such a standard is beyond the scopeof this rulemaking, which is being conducted solely to revise OSHA's aircontaminant limits. Despite some of the uncertainties in the studies described above regardingthe relationship between airborne exposure levels and health effects, OSHAconcludes that the data suggest that the former PEL of 0.1 mg/m\3\ is notsufficiently protective. Given the severity of the neuropathic effectscaused by mercury poisoning, OSHA finds that a reduction in the airbornelimit is necessary to ensure that workers are not at significant risk ofmercury-related neuropathic effects. Therefore, OSHA is revising its PELfor elemental mercury vapor to 0.05 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA. In addition,because skin absorption is a significant route of exposure and leads tosystemic poisoning, as evidenced by Mr. Smerko's written testimony, OSHAis including a skin notation in the final rule.OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.05 mg/m\3\ TWA for mercuryvapor, with a skin notation. The Agency concludes that this limit willsubstantially reduce the significant risks of acute and chronic mercurypoisoning (which constitute material health impairments) that have beendemonstrated to occur at exposure levels above 0.05 mg/m\3\. The skin notationis added because the vapors of elemental mercury can be readily absorbedthrough the skin.<ITAG tagnum="71">MERCURY, (ORGANO) ALKYL COMPOUNDS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7439-97-6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1242</ITAG>OSHA had a former 8-hour PEL of 0.01 mg/m\3\ TWA and a ceiling limit of0.04 mg/m\3\ for the alkyl compounds of mercury. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWAof 0.01 mg/m\3\ and a TLV-STEL of 0.03 mg/m,\3\ with a skin notation, forthese compounds, measured as mercury. The Agency proposed, and the finalrule is establishing, permissible exposure limits of 0.01 mg/m\3\ as an8-hour TWA and 0.03 mg/m\3\ as a STEL, with a skin notation, for the alkylcompounds of mercury (measured as Hg). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, table N1) concurswith these limits. Alkyl mercury compounds include volatile liquids, suchas dimethyl and diethyl mercury, as well as many complex salts, which areusually solids.Alkyl mercury compounds pose greater health hazards than do the inorganiccompounds of mercury because they can penetrate the blood-brain barrierand the placenta very quickly. The primary toxic effects associated withexposure to the organic compounds of mercury are injuries to the centraland peripheral nervous systems and to the kidneys (Casarett and Doull 1975/Ex.1-1144). In addition, data concerning mouse and rat exposures to alkylmercury compounds have demonstrated toxicity to the gastrointestinal system,pancreas, liver, gonads, and cardiovascular system. Suppression of theimmune system and impairment of the endocrine system have also been observed(Shakbazyan, Shevchenko, Borisenko et al. 1977/Ex. 1-933). Fatalities inmice have been reported following exposures of 10 to 30 mg/m\3\ for 3 to5 hours (Trakhtenberg 1950/Ex. 1-447).Methyl mercury is among the most damaging of the alkyl compounds to humansbecause it accumulates in the body and causes developmental effects (Wilson1977/Ex. 1-457). A three-month exposure to approximately 1 mg/m3 diethylmercury caused death in two individuals (Hill 1943/Ex. 1-786). Anotherfatal case of alkyl mercury poisoning has also been described (Hook, Lundgren,and Swensson 1954/Ex. 1-333). On the basis of his work with laboratoryanimals, Trakhtenberg (1950/Ex. 1-447) stated that even a concentrationas low as 0.00001 mg/m3 could not be tolerated by humans on a continuingbasis. However, a later study reported no consistent, acute effects ofmercury poisoning at air concentrations between 0.01 and 0.1 mg/m3, despitethe fact that brief excursions considerably above this range occurred (Dinman,Evans, and Linch 1958/Ex. 1-311). Organic mercury compounds can be absorbedthrough the skin (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials,</T3> 7th ed., Sax andLewis 1989).  Lawrence H. Hecker, representing Abbott Laboratories (Ex. 3-678), objectedto the inclusion of a STEL for the alkyl mercury compounds, stating thatthere is no health basis for such a limit. OSHA believes that both theseriousness of the neurological effects caused by exposure to low levelsof alkyl mercury and the ability of alkyl mercury to accumulate in thebody necessitate the establishment of a STEL to ensure that the PEL isnot exceeded. As discussed in Section VI.C.17 of this preamble, OSHA hasdetermined that a STEL is warranted in instances where extremely hazardoussubstances are involved.  OSHA is retaining its 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.01 mg/m3 and adding a 15-minuteSTEL of 0.03 mg/m3 for the alkyl compounds of mercury (measured as Hg),with a skin notation. The Agency concludes that exposure to the alkyl mercurycompounds poses significant risks of severe neuropathic and other systemicinjuries, which constitute material health impairments, and that both theshort-term and 8-hour limits are necessary to reduce these risks. OSHAhas added the skin notation to protect against the dermal absorption possiblein the absence of a skin notation.  <ITAG tagnum="71">METHYLACRYLONITRILE    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 126-98-7; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>=C(CH<T2>3</T2>)C=N  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1251</ITAG>OSHA previously had no standard for methylacrylonitrile. The ACGIH recommendsa 1-ppm TLV-TWA with a skin notation to protect workers who are occupationallyexposed to methylacrylonitrile. The Agency proposed, and the final ruleestablishes, a permissible 8-hour TWA exposure limit of 1 ppm, with a skinnotation, for methylacrylonitrile, which is a colorless liquid. NIOSH (Ex.8-47, Table N1) concurs that these limits are appropriate.  Methylacrylonitrile has been shown to be extremely toxic in animals, bothby inhalation and dermal absorption. The dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 0.35 ml/kg (280 mg/kg) (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.370). Beagles exposed for 90 days to 13.5 ppm convulsed and lost motorcontrol in their hind limbs. Microscopic brain lesions were detected inone of the dogs. The level at which no effects were detected was determinedto be between 3.2 and 8.8 ppm (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 370). No comments(other than NIOSH's) on the health effects of methylacrylonitrile weresubmitted to the rulemaking record.  OSHA is establishing a 1-ppm 8-hour TWA PEL and a skin notation for thissubstance. The Agency concludes this limit will substantially reduce thesignificant risk of neurological damage (which constitutes a material healthimpairment) that formerly existed in the absence of an OSHA exposure limitfor this substance.  <ITAG tagnum="71">METHLY BROMIDE  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 74-83-9; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>Br  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1253</ITAG>OSHA's former PEL for methyl bromide was a 20-ppm ceiling with a skin notation,while the ACGIH limit is 5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, with a skin notation.NIOSH recommends that the REL for this substance be set at the lowest feasiblelevel. The Agency proposed, and the final rule establishes, a permissibleexposure limit of 5 ppm (8-hour TWA), with a skin notation, for methylbromide. Methyl bromide is a colorless, nonflammable gas with no tasteand no odor at low temperatures. At levels above 5 ppm, it has a sweetishodor.   Acute poisoning from methyl bromide is characterized by lung irritation,pulmonary edema, convulsions, and coma. Chronic exposure to low concentrationsof methyl bromide generally produces central nervous system effects, includingmuscle weakness and pain, incoordination, inability to focus one's eyes,and behavioral changes (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 376; Craft 1983/Ex. 1-196).The onset of neurological signs and symptoms may be delayed for from severalhours to a few days after exposure.  Methyl bromide is a gas and is predominantly an inhalation hazard, althoughthere are suggestions that it can also be absorbed through the skin (<T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology</T3>, 3rd rev. ed., Vol.2B, p. 3443, Clayton and Clayton 1981). A report by Hine (1969/Ex. 1-70)notes that methyl bromide has been responsible for more deaths among occupationallyexposed workers in California than have the organophosphates. It is hypothesizedthat methyl bromide has a greater potential for toxicity than do otherorganic bromides because its greater lipophilicity provides increased accessto the brain.  Various studies demonstrate methyl bromide's toxicity in humans. Ingram(1951/Ex. 1-175) reported ill effects (symptoms not specified) after exposureto methyl bromide at concentrations of 100 ppm. Similar exposure concentrationswere also reported by Hine (1969/Ex. 1-70) in a case study of two datepackers in California. Johnson, Setzer, Lewis, and Anger (1977/Ex. 1-87)indicated that 34 packers became sick when exposed to an average methylbromide concentration of 50 ppm, although concentrations in the packingroom may have been as high as 100 to 150 ppm during the purging of a fumigationchamber.  Watrous (1942/Ex. 1-275) described nausea, vomiting, and headache in 90workers who were exposed for two weeks to concentations ``generally below''35 ppm. These symptoms emphasized the need to create a TLV to protect workersfrom the nausea, vomiting, and headaches (which together constitute materialimpairments of health) associated with lower levels of exposure. This needis strengthened by the fact that, since these symptoms are usually delayedin onset, workers may not have sufficient warning of this substance's potentialneurotoxicity.The AFL-CIO (Ex. 194, p. A-12) supports the inclusion of methyl bromidein this rulemaking, but notes that it is a potential occupational carcinogen.NIOSH takes the same position and believes that methyl bromide should beaddressed in a full section 6(b) rulemaking (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B; Tr. pp.3-97, 3-98). OSHA shares the concerns of these commenters and intends tomonitor the scientific evidence on methyl bromide's toxicity in the future.The Workers Institute for Safety and Health (WISH) (Ex. 116) is of theopinion that a ceiling limit is more appropriate than an 8-hour TWA formethyl bromide. OSHA finds, however, that the 5-ppm TWA will provide protectionagainst the levels shown to produce poisoning in humans (generally in the50- to 150-ppm range). The presence of neurologic symptoms at levels below 35 ppm indicates thatthe former ceiling limit of 20 ppm is not adequate to protect workers fromthe effects of methyl bromide poisoning. OSHA is establishing a PEL of5 ppm TWA, with a skin notation, to protect workers more adequately againstthese incapacitating symptoms. The Agency concludes that these limits willreduce this significant risk substantially. <ITAG tagnum="71">PENTABORANE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 19624-22-7; Chemical Formula: B<T2>5</T2>H<T2>9</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1304</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for pentaborane was 0.005 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. TheACGIH has the same 8-hour TWA but additionally recommends a 15-minute STELof 0.015 ppm. The Agency proposed, and the final rule establishes, permissibleexposure limits of 0.005 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 0.015 ppm as a 15-minuteSTEL for pentaborane. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs that these limitsare appropriate. Pentaborane is a colorless liquid with a strong and penetratingodor. In both humans and animals, inhalation of pentaborane vapor causes centralnervous system effects (Svirbely 1954a/Ex. 1-385; Rozendaal 1951/Ex. 1-525;Lowe and Freeman 1957/Ex. 1-518; Cordasco, Cooper, Murphy, and Anderson1962/Ex. 1-545). The 5-minute LC<T2>50</T2> for rats and mice is 67 and 40 ppm, respectively; for 60 minutes,these values are 10 and 6 ppm for rats and mice, respectively (Weir, Bath,and Weeks 1961, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 459). Rats exposed repeatedlyto 3 ppm pentaborane by inhalation exhibited tremors, hyperexcitability,belligerence, and weight loss (Svirbely 1954a/Ex. 1-385). Rats, rabbits,monkeys, and dogs exposed repeatedly to pentaborane vapor at concentrationsof 1 ppm for four weeks or 0.2 ppm for six months lost weight (Levinskas,Paslian, and Bleckman 1958/Ex. 1-517). In the same experiments, rats andrabbits exposed at 1 ppm showed reduced activity and impaired locomotorability, respectively, and monkeys and dogs exhibited apathy, loss of appetite,insensitivity to pain, loss of mobility, tremor, and impaired coordination.The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 459) notes that the 0.2-ppm concentration reportedin the Levinskas, Paslian, and Bleckman (1958/Ex. 1-517) study was a calculatedrather than measured value and that the actual exposure level was probablycloser to 0.01 ppm. Humans accidentally overexposed to pentaborane experienced tremors, convulsions,behavioral changes, loss of memory, impaired judgment, and other symptomsof central nervous system intoxication (Svirbely 1954a/Ex. 1-385; Rozendaal1951/Ex. 1-525; Lowe and Freeman 1957/Ex. 1-518; Cordasco, Cooper, Murphy,and Anderson 1962/Ex. 1-545). No comments other than those from NIOSH werereceived on the health effects associated with pentaborane exposure. OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.005 ppm and a 15-minute STELof 0.015 ppm for pentaborane. The Agency concludes that these limits willprotect workers against the significant risk of central nervous systemeffects, such as tremors and convulsions, behavioral changes, and lossof judgment, potentially associated with exposure to pentaborane at levelsonly slightly above those formerly permitted by the 8-hour TWA alone. OSHAfinds that these neuropathic effects constitute material health impairmentswithin the meaning of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="71">PHENYL MERCAPTAN </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-98-5; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>SH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1316</ITAG>OSHA previously had no exposure limit for phenyl mercaptan. The ACGIH hasa TLV-TWA of 0.5 ppm. NIOSH recommends a 15-minute ceiling limit of 0.1ppm for phenyl mercaptan (benzenethiol). The Agency proposed a permissibleexposure limit of 0.5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, and the final rule establishesthis limit. Phenyl mercaptan is a colorless liquid with an offensive, garlic-likeodor. The primary acute hazards of exposure to phenyl mercaptan are central nervoussystem stimulation followed by post-convulsive CNS depression, severe eyeand skin irritation, systemic toxicity to spleen, kidney, lung, and livertissues, and narcotic effects (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 478). Phenyl mercaptan has been reported to have 4-hour inhalation LC<T2>50</T2> values of 33 and 28 ppm for rats and mice, respectively (Doulland Plzak 1962, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 478; Fairchild and Stokinger1958/Ex. 1-415). The oral LD<T2>50</T2> for the rat is reported to be 46 mg/kg (McCord and Witheridge1949/Ex. 1-882; Robles 1975, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 478). Forthe rabbit and rat, the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> values are 134 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg, respectively (Doull andPlzak 1962, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 478; Fairchild and Stokinger1958/Ex. 1-415); Schafer 1972/Ex. 1-362). The responses of animals to phenylmercaptan exposure were uniform regardless of species, and progressed fromCNS stimulation to incoordination, skeletal and muscular paralysis, andrespiratory depression, followed at high concentrations by coma and death.High doses (not further specified) administered via inhalation producedlung, liver, and kidney changes in mice (Doull and Plzak 1962, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 478; Fairchild and Stokinger 1958/Ex. 1-415);Schafer 1972/Ex. 1-362). In rabbits, phenyl mercaptan is a severe eye andskin irritant (McCord and Witheridge 1949/Ex. 1-882; Robles 1975, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 478; Schafer 1972/Ex. 1-362). In humans, phenyl mercaptan is a moderately toxic skin irritant and causessevere dermatitis, headaches, and dizziness at unspecified levels (Fairchildand Stokinger 1958/Ex. 1-415; McCord and Witheridge 1949/Ex. 1-882). NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N7; Tr. p. 3-99) believes that the limit for phenyl mercaptanis better expressed as a ceiling than as a time-weighted average; however,OSHA believes that a TWA limit set at 0.5 ppm will protect against phenylmercaptan's toxic effects. No other comments on the health effects of phenylmercaptan were submitted to the rulemaking record. OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.5 ppm for phenyl mercaptan.The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workers from the significantrisks of CNS effects, skin irritation, and systemic injury, all materialimpairments of health that are potentially associated with exposure tophenyl mercaptan at the uncontrolled levels formerly permitted by the absenceof any OSHA limit. <ITAG tagnum="71">PROPYLENE GLYCOL DINITRATE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 6423-43-4; Chemical Formula: C<T2>3</T2>H<T2>6</T2>N<T2>2</T2>O<T2>6</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1342</ITAG>OSHA previously had no exposure limit for propylene glycol dinitrate. TheACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 0.05 ppm, with a skin notation. The Agencyproposed a permissible exposure limit of 0.05 ppm TWA, with a skin notation,for this substance, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with the proposedlimit. The final rule establishes a PEL of 0.05 ppm but does not includethe proposed skin notation. When freshly prepared, propylene glycol dinitrateis a colorless liquid with a disagreeable odor.Exposure to this substance affects blood pressure, causes methemoglobinuriaand respiratory toxicity, injures liver and kidney tissues, and distortsvision. Propylene glycol dinitrate can also cause headache and incoordination.The oral LD<T2>50</T2> value for the rat is between 480 and 250 mg/kg (Clark and Litchfield1969/Ex. 1-543; Andersen and Mehl 1973/Ex. 1-536), and the subcutaneousLD<T2>50</T2> is 530 mg/kg (Andersen and Mehl 1973/Ex. 1-536). Mice are reportedto be somewhat more resistant, with a subcutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> of slightly more than 1200 mg/kg; however, cats appear to beeven more susceptible to propylene glycol dinitrate and exhibit a subcutaneousLD<T2>50</T2> of between 200 and 300 mg/kg (Clark and Litchfield 1969/Ex.1-543). In all species studied, death occurs by anoxia, which is causedby almost complete conversion of hemoglobin to methemoglobin (Clark andLitchfield 1969/Ex. 1-543). Skin tests in albino rabbits did not produceirritation, but ocular instillation caused transient conjunctival redness(Jones, Strickland, and Siegel 1972/Ex. 1-742). Twenty-day skin exposuresin rabbits at 1 g/kg caused minor irritation, and at 2 g/kg, rabbits becameweak and cyanotic; one of five rabbits died, and this animal's hemoglobinand hematocrit values had decreased. When the dose was increased to 4 g/kg,the rabbits' methemoglobin values rose to 34.5 percent at death (Jones,Strickland, and Siegel 1972/Ex. 1-742). Continuous 90-day inhalation exposuresat 10 ppm caused kidney and liver changes in dogs; exposures at 35 ppmcaused heavy iron deposits in the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Female (butnot male) rats showed a drop in blood pressure within 30 minutes afterinjection of doses above 5 mg/kg. Rhesus monkeys displayed mydriasis in90-day exposures at 35 ppm but no change in avoidance behavior during avisual discrimination and acuity threshold test (Jones, Strickland, andSiegel 1972/Ex. 1-742). In humans, eight-hour exposures to 0.2 ppm or higher concentrations ofpropylene glycol dinitrate resulted in visual distortion and headache (Stewart,Peterson, Newton et al. 1974, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 502).Although subjects developed a tolerance for the headache response, thevisual effects were cumulative. Impaired balance occurred after 6.5 hoursof exposure to 0.5 ppm, and a 40-minute exposure to 1.5 ppm caused eyeirritation. Subjects exposed at 0.5 ppm for 8 hours experienced a consistentelevation in diastolic pressure but no pulmonary irritation. At concentrationsof 0.03 to 1.5 ppm, no hematologic effects were observed (Stewart, Peterson,Newton et al. 1974, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 502). Studies ofhuman exposures to levels below 0.1 ppm do not report chronic neurotoxicity(Horvath, Ilka, Boyd, and Markhan 1981/Ex. 1-557). The skin notation included in the proposal for this substance is not includedin the final rule because evidence demonstates that the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is even greater than  2 g/kg (see the discussionin Section VI.C.18 for OSHA's policy on skin notations). No comments exceptthose from NIOSH were received on the health effects of propylene glycoldinitrate. OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.05 ppm for propylene glycoldinitrate. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workers againstthe significant risks of hepatotoxic, hematologic, and central nervoussystem effects (all of which constitute material health impairments) thatexist from workplace exposure at the levels permitted in the absence ofany OSHA PEL. Conclusions OSHA concludes that significant risks are associated with occupationalexposure to the group of neuropathic toxicants shown in Table C1-1. Theeffects caused by such exposures include brain lesions, nausea, vomiting,general depression of the central nervous system, interference with sensoryand motor functions, and alterations in the ability of the brain to processinformation. Affected workers may experience drowsiness, dizziness, lossof ability to concentrate, mood changes, reduced awareness, learning difficulty,unsteadiness, and auditory and visual disturbances. In addition, employeesexperiencing these effects are imperiled and are likely to hurt themselvesor others in accidents caused by their reduced functional capacities. Thefinal rule's promulgation of new or revised exposure limits for these neurotoxinssubstantially reduces such risks and affords protection to workers againstthese material health impairments.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of NarcoticEffects </ITAG><T3>Introduction </T3>OSHA is establishing new or revised limits for 19 substances based primarilyon evidence showing that occupational exposure to these substances causesnarcosis. The narcotic effects of exposure to such substances as the alcohols,aliphatic hydrocarbons, and chlorinated hydrocarbons have been recognizedas serious for many years. Table C2-1 lists these chemicals, their CASand HS numbers, and their former, proposed, and final rule limits. Forseven of these substances, the Agency is lowering the 8-hour TWA permissibleexposure limit and revising or adding a STEL. In five additional casesOSHA is retaining its former 8-hour TWA permissible exposure limit andadding a STEL. Eight-hour TWAs and/or STELs are being established for fourpreviously unregulated substances, and in three other cases, OSHA is loweringits 8-hour TWA permissible exposure limit. <T3>Description of the Health Effects </T3>Narcosis is caused by a general depression of central nervous system (CNS)function. When the CNS becomes sufficiently depressed, the awareness orconsciousness of affected persons is diminished. Initial symptoms of narcosisinclude drowsiness, difficulty in concentration, and mood changes; theseeffects may progress to slurred speech, dizziness, loss of coordination,and, in more severe cases, loss of consciousness, coma, and death. Exceptin more serious cases, CNS depression is reversible if the exposure ceases.However, because narcosis adversely affects the concentration and coordinationof affected workers, these workers and their co-workers are at increasedrisk of injuries and accidents caused by slowed reaction times, incoordination,and mistakes and errors in judgment. Moreover, these effects constitutematerial impairments of health or functional capacity within the meaningof the Act, even if they are not permanent.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M003 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 0 316-318 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>The mechanism by which exposure to substances induces narcosis is poorlyunderstood. It is believed that CNS depressants may have the same mechanismof action as general anesthetics, which appear to produce a reversibleeffect on electrically excitable neuronal membranes.Dose-Response Relationship and Narcotic Effects The induction of narcosis following exposure to narcotic agents is expectedto follow the classical S-shaped (sigmoidal) dose-response relationship.As exposure level increases, both the percent of exposed persons affectedand the severity of the effect increase. Although it is not known whethera true threshold exists for the occurrence of the molecular events leadingto narcosis (i.e., disruption of electrical impulses in neurons), thereis usually a level at which most exposed individuals will manifest theonset of symptoms associated with narcosis. The no-effect level for a particularsubstance is determined largely by individual susceptibility, the extentto which the material is absorbed, and the rate at which it is metabolizedand eliminated. The following discussion describes the record evidence and OSHA's findingsfor the substances in this group and illustrates the material health impairmentsassociated with workplace exposure to these substances.<ITAG tagnum="71">BUTANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 106-97-8; Chemical Formula: C<T2>4</T2>H<T2>10</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1044.</ITAG>Previously, OSHA had no limit for butane. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 800ppm for this colorless, flammable gas. The proposed PEL was 800 ppm asan 8-hour TWA, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1,) concurs with this limit.The final rule promulgates an 8-hour TWA of 800 ppm. The primary risk of exposure to butane is narcosis, which occurs at highexposure levels. Exposure to 10,000 ppm butane for 10 minutes causes drowsiness,but there are no reports of systemic toxicity or irritation at this level(Gerarde 1963a, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 10). In rats, the 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> for butane is 658 g/m3, or about 280,000 ppm (NIOSH 1977i/Ex.1-1182). Humans exposed to 1000 ppm for a single eight-hour day, or to500 ppm for two-week periods of eight-hour workdays, showed no harmfulsubjective or abnormal physiological responses but did show a reduced visualevoked response (VER) wave amplitude during the second week (Stewart, Herrman,Baretta et al. 1977/Ex. 1-575). OSHA received no comments, other than NIOSH'son butane. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a permissible exposure limit of800 ppm TWA for butane. The Agency concludes that this limit will protectworkers against the significant risks of drowsiness and other narcoticeffects, which together consitute material health impairments and are associatedwith exposures at the uncontrolled levels permitted in the past by theabsence of an OSHA limit. <ITAG tagnum="71">sec-BUTYL ALCOHOL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 78-92-2; Chimical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2> CH<T2>2</T2> CHOHCH<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1049</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for sec-butyl alcohol was 150 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.The proposed PELs were 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 150 ppm as a 15-minuteSTEL, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) concurred with these limits. In the final rule,OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 100 ppm but is not adding a STEL(see the discussion of the Agency's policy on STELs for this rulemakingin Section VI.C.17). sec-Butyl alcohol is a colorless liquid with a strong,wine-like odor.     The acute toxicity of sec-butyl alcohol is reported to be lower than thatof n-butanol, for which OSHA is establishing a ceiling of 50 ppm. The oralLD<T2>50</T2>s in rats for these two substances are 6.5 g/kg for sec-butylalcohol and 4.4 g/kg for n-butanol, respectively (Smyth, Carpenter, andWeil 1951/Ex. 1-439). Liquid sec-butyl alcohol is less injurious to theeyes than liquid n-butanol (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 77). Occupational exposuresto sec-butyl alcohol at levels of about 100 ppm were reported not to beassociated with difficulties (Banks 1966, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 77).OSHA received a comment on this substance from the American IndustrialHygiene Association (AIHA) (Ex. 8-16). The AIHA noted that there was noevidence to support a STEL for this substance and reported that the ACGIHintends to delete this STEL. OSHA has arrived at the same conclusion, andthe final rule thus has no STEL for sec-butyl alcohol.OSHA is reducing the permissible exposure limit for sec-butyl alcohol to100 ppm TWA to afford protection against the significant risks of narcosisand irritation, which are material health impairments that are caused byexposures to sec-butyl alcohol at concentrations above the revised PEL.The Agency concludes that this limit will substantially reduce this risk.<ITAG tagnum="71">tert-BUTYL ALCOHOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CASL 75-65-0; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>3</T2>COH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1050</ITAG>OSHA formerly had a limit of 100 ppm for tert-butyl alcohol. The ACGIHhas a TLV-TWA of 100 ppm, with a TLV-STEL of 150 ppm. OSHA proposed toretain the 8-hour TWA limit of 100 ppm and to add a STEL of 150 ppm fortert-butyl alcohol, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs. These limitsare established by the final rule. At ordinary temperatures and pressures,tert-butyl alcohol exists in the form of colorless, hygroscopic crystals(ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3).Although similar to the other butyl alcohols in many respects, tert-butylalcohol is more volatile and has a greater potential for narcotic effectsthan other butyl alcohols (Weese 1928/Ex. 1-1073). Mice exposed to tert-butylalcohol exhibit a stronger narcotic response than they show when exposedto normal or isobutyl alcohol (Weese 1928/Ex. 1-1073). Repeated daily dosesof tert-butyl alcohol that produced narcosis were not fatal in animals(Schaffarzick and Brown 1952/Ex. 1-868). In humans, contact with t-butylalcohol produces erythema and hyperemia (Oettel 1936/Ex. 1-921). Exceptfor NIOSH's submittal, OSHA received no comments on tert-butyl alcohol.In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA PEL of 100 ppm andadding a 15-minute STEL of 150 ppm for tert-butyl alcohol. The Agency concludesthat this combination of limits will protect against the significant riskof narcosis, which constitutes a material health impairment that potentiallyoccurs at levels above the 8-hour TWA PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">CYCLOPENTANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 287-92-3; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1111</ITAG>Previously, OSHA had no limit for cyclopentane. The proposed PEL was 600ppm as an 8-hour TWA, and NIOSH concurred with this limit (Ex. 8-47, TableN1). The final rule promulgates this limit, which is consistent with thatof the ACGIH. Cyclopentane is a mobile, colorless, and flammable liquid.The existing animal data indicate that cyclopentane is a narcotic agent.As with other alicyclic hydrocarbons, exposure to high concentrations causesexcitement, loss of equilibrium, stupor, coma, and, rarely, respiratoryfailure (Gerarde 1963a, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 164). No majoranimal studies on the effects of cyclopentane exposure have been reported,and evaluations of the toxic properties of this substance have thereforerelied on the animal data for n-pentane. n-Pentane has been shown to causenarcosis in animals at exposures of 90,000 to 120,000 ppm for 5 to 60 minutes(Abbritti, Siracusa, Cianchetti et al. 1976/Ex. 1-406). Swann, Kwon, andHogan (1974/Ex. 1-124) reported that a concentration of 130,000 ppm isfatal. Almost no data are available concerning the chronic effects of cyclopentaneexposure.Abbritti, Siracusa, Cianchetti et al. (1976/Ex. 1-406) reported that petroleumsolvents used in the Italian shoe industry contain up to 18 percent cyclopentane.Workers exposed to these solvents have developed polyneuropathy, and Oettel(1936/Ex. 1-921) reported that skin exposure to such solvents caused burningand skin blistering after 15 minutes of confined contact. It has not beendetermined whether the irritation was caused by cyclopentane or by cyclopentaneand other substances, such as n-hexane, in the solvent. OSHA received nocomments other than those from NIOSH.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a PEL of 600 ppm as an 8-hour TWAfor cyclopentane. OSHA concludes that occupational exposure to cyclopentaneposes a significant risk of irritation and narcosis, which constitute materialimpairments of health that occur at levels somewhat above the PEL establishedin the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="71">ETHYL BROMIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 74-96-4; Chemical Formula: C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>Br</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1163</ITAG>OSHA formerly had an 8-hour TWA limit of 200 ppm for ethyl bromide. TheACGIH also has a limit of 200 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 250 ppm as a 15-minuteSTEL. The proposal retained the PEL of 200 ppm and added a STEL of 250ppm; these limits are established by the final rule. Ethyl bromide is acolorless, highly volatile, flammable liquid with an ether-like odor; itbecomes yellow when exposed to light and air.The concentrations of ethyl bromide reported as lethal to guinea pigs are3200 ppm for 9 hours and 1700 ppm for 12.5 hours (Sayers, Yant, Thomas,and Berger 1929/Ex. 1-803). von Oettingen (1955/Ex. 1-876) reported theminimal lethal concentration of this substance for mice as 3500 ppm.Ethyl bromide acts as a central nervous system depressant (narcotic); additionally,exposure causes irritation of the lungs and congestion and fatty degenerationof the liver, intestinal hemorrhage, and kidney swelling. Several deathshave been reported from the use of ethyl bromide as a general anesthetic(von Oettingen 1955/Ex. 1-876). The record contains no submissions on thehealth effects of ethyl bromide exposure other than a submission from NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N2; Tr. 3-86) indicating its nonconcurrence. NIOSH notedthat one study (Karimullna and Gizatullina 1969) demonstrated liver injuryand disrupted liver function in rats exposed 4 hours daily for 6 monthsto 540 ppm ethyl bromide. NIOSH also reported that an NTP inhalation bioassayto assess the carcinogenicity of ethyl bromide in rats and mice exposedat 100, 200, or 400 ppm was scheduled for peer review in October 1988.OSHA will review this study and any others that become available on thissubstance to determine whether further action is warranted.In the final rule, OSHA is retaining its PEL of 200 ppm as an 8-hour TWAand adding a 15-minute STEL of 250 ppm for ethyl bromide. The Agency concludesthat these limits will work together to reduce the significant risks ofnarcosis, kidney and liver damage, and respiratory irritation, all materialimpairments of health that are associated with occupational exposure toelevated levels of ethyl bromide.<ITAG tagnum="71">GASOLINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 8006-61-9; Chemical Formula: None</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1185</ITAG>Previously, OSHA had no PEL for gasoline. The ACGIH has a 300-ppm 8-hourTWA and a 500-ppm 15-minute STEL for this substance. OSHA proposed a TWAPEL of 300 ppm and a STEL of 500, and these limits are established in thefinal rule.Studies have shown that exposure to 2000 ppm of gasoline for 30 minutesproduces mild anesthesia, while exposure to concentrations between 500and 900 ppm for one hour produces dizziness (Gerarde 1963a and Runion 1975,both as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 283). However, these authors alsofound that people exposed to gasoline at concentrations of 160 to 270 ppmfor several hours do not experience any symptoms of narcosis but may, asDr. Liem (Ex. 46) points out, experience eye and throat irritation.Several commenters noted that gasoline, or specific types of gasoline (i.e.,unleaded), may cause kidney and liver damage and cancer, in addition toCNS effects (Exs. 3-746, 8-47, 194, 197; Tr. VII, pp. 70-76). Dr. FranklinMirer, Director of the Health and Safety Department of the United AutoWorkers, made the following statement, which is typical of the views ofthis group of commenters:<ITAG tagnum="21">The crucial study in redefining the toxicity of aliphatic hydrocarbonsis an inhalation bioassay of unleaded gasoline conducted by the AmericanPetroleum Institute in 1984. The study found increased kidney tumors inmale rats and liver tumors in female mice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The rat portion of the study gave definitely clear evidence of carcinogenicactivity. Kidney tumors appeared in a group of rats exposed at 292 partsper million, although a statistical analysis was not documented in thepublished report. Of greater concern to me than the carcinogenic effectwas that male rats also suffered a characteristic toxic kidney effect[s].Indications of this toxicity appeared as early as three to six months inrats exposed at 47 parts per million (Tr. VII, pp. 70-71).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NIOSH shares these concerns and commented (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B) thatgasoline would be an appropriate candidate for a full Section 6(b) rulemaking.OSHA is aware that there is a recent and rapidly developing body of evidenceabout other health effects associated with exposure to gasoline and otherpetroleum materials and that this is an active area of toxicological research.However, the Agency agrees with the American Petroleum Institute (Ex. 124,p. 4) that complex and difficult scientific questions remain to be answeredbefore conclusions can be drawn about these other potentially toxic effectsof gasoline exposure. OSHA believes that it would be inappropriate to delayaction on this substance at the present time. NIOSH representatives atthe hearing (Tr. pp. 3-130, 3-131) agreed that, in the absence of a NIOSHREL for gasoline, promulgation of the proposed limits would constitutean appropriate first step in affording exposed workers protection againstthese health effects.OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 300 ppm, supplemented with a STELof 500 ppm, to ensure that workplace exposure levels to gasoline do notexceed the TWA level for any length of time; these limits are intendedto protect against narcosis. OSHA concludes that the 8-hour TWA and STELbeing promulgated in the final rule will substantially reduce the significantrisks posed to workers exposed to gasoline in their places of work. Theseexposure-related health effects, which include narcosis and liver and kidneydamage, clearly constitute material impairments of health within the meaningof the Act.<ITAG tagnum="71">HEPTANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 142-82-5; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2> (CH<T2>2</T2>)<T2>5</T2>CH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1194</ITAG>The former OSHA limit for heptane was 500 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. The ACGIHTLVs for heptane are 400 ppm as a TWA and 500 ppm as a STEL. NIOSH (1977a/Ex.1-233) has recommended that workplace exposures to heptane not exceed 85ppm as a full-shift TWA or 440 ppm as a 15-minute ceiling limit. The proposedPEL and STEL were 400 and 500 ppm, respectively, and these limits are establishedby the final rule. Heptane is a clear, flammable liquid which is highlyvolatile.Patty and Yant (1929, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 297) reportedthat exposure to 1000 ppm of heptane for 6 minutes caused slight dizzinessin humans; exposures to higher levels caused vertigo, incoordination, andinappropriate behavior. These authors also reported that a four-minuteexposure to 5000 ppm produced complaints of loss of appetite and nausea.Based on this information, as well as on animal data showing 10,000 to15,000 ppm to be an effect level for heptane-induced narcosis (Fuhner 1921,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 297), the ACGIH concluded that heptanewas more acutely toxic than hexane. The ACGIH therefore recommended limitsfor heptane that are somewhat lower than the limits for the hexane isomers.As discussed in connection with pentane and the hexane isomers, NIOSH (1977a/Ex.1-233) has recommended the same occupational exposure limits for all ofthe C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes (i.e., 350 mg/m3 TWA and 1800 mg/m3 as a 15-minute ceiling).This recommendation is based on NIOSH's belief that all C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes possess a potential neurotoxic capability similar tothat of n-hexane. OSHA disagrees with this concept (see the discussionof this issue in Section V of the preamble); the Agency finds that theneurotoxicity caused by exposure to n-hexane is the result of the actionof a unique metabolite, 2,5-hexanedione; the majority of record commentersagreed with OSHA that n-hexane is uniquely toxic (Exs. 3-593, 3-896, and3-1246).NIOSH does not concur with the limits being established for heptane (Ex.8-47, Table N2) because NIOSH believes that ``it would be incorrect toconclude that the neurotoxic properties ascribed to n-hexane are uniqueto this compound [n-hexane]. Other alkanes or related chemicals [such asheptane] that are ultimately metabolized to gamma diketone may have similartoxicity'' (Tr. III, p. 110). However, OSHA does not agree with NIOSH thatall of the C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes have equal toxicity (see the discussion in Section Vof the preamble); OSHA believes that n-hexane is uniquely toxic.The AFL-CIO (Ex. 194, p. A-7) reiterated its position that OSHA shouldpromulgate a 10-ppm limit for all of the petroleum solvents, includingheptane. However, OSHA has determined (see Section IV.D) that it wouldbe inappropriate at this time to enlarge the scope of this already extensiveregulation. The United Auto Workers (Ex. 197) described engineering controlsthat could be used to achieve the lower levels the unions advocate forall petroleum solvents; these are discussed in Section VII.Because heptane is considered to be more acutely toxic than hexane, OSHAconcludes that it is appropriate to revise its limit for heptane to a levelbelow that established for the hexane isomers to reduce the significantrisk of narcosis, which is a material health impairment. Therefore, OSHAis revising its limit for heptane to 400 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 500 ppmas a 15-minute STEL. The Agency concludes that the TWA and STEL togetherwill substantially reduce this significant occupational risk.<ITAG tagnum="71">HEXANE ISOMERS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: None; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>3</T2>C<T2>3</T2>H<T2>5</T2>; n(CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>4</T2>C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1201</ITAG>Previously, OSHA had no limit for the hexane isomers. The ACGIH TLVs forthe hexane isomers are 500 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 1000 ppm as a 15-minuteSTEL. NIOSH has a recommended TWA limit for these isomers of 100 ppm, supplementedwith a 510-ppm 15-minute ceiling. The proposed and final rule PELs arean 8-hour TWA of 500 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 1000 ppm. The hexanesare clear, highly volatile liquids with a mild gasoline-like odor.A study by Drinker, Yaglou, and Warren (1943/Ex. 1-730) shows that humansexposed to 1400 to 1500 ppm of hexane experienced nausea and headache.Patty and Yant (1929, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 307) found thata 10-minute exposure to 5000 ppm caused giddiness and dizziness in exposedsubjects. A study by Nelson, Enge, Ross et al. (1943/Ex. 1-66) showed noeffects in unacclimated subjects exposed to hexane isomers in concentrationsof 500 ppm, but narcotic effects have often been seen in subjects exposedat levels above 1000 ppm (Elkins 1959d, as cited in ACGIH 1986, Ex. 1-3,p. 307). The ACGIH based its limit primarily on the Nelson, Enge, Rosset al. (1943/Ex. 1-66) study.NIOSH recommends limits for the hexane isomers of 100 ppm as a 10-hourTWA and 510 ppm as a 15-minute short-term limit. These recommendationsare based on human and animal evidence showing that exposure to n-hexanebelow concentrations of 500 ppm is associated with the development of polyneuropathy(Inoue, Takeuchi, Takeuchi et al. 1970/Ex.1-75; Miyagaki 1967/Ex. 1-198);NIOSH (1977a/Ex. 1-233) did not distinguish between n-hexane and otherhexane isomers when making its recommendation for an exposure limit. NIOSHconcluded that all of the C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes are potential neuropathic agents and should have thesame PELs as those established for n-hexane. OSHA disagrees with NIOSH that all C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes are potential neuropathic agents. As discussed in SectionV of the preamble, OSHA believes that a metabolite of n-hexane (2,5-hexanedione)is responsible for the unique neurotoxic properties of n-hexane (see alsothe discussion of n-hexane in Section VI.C.1 of the Preamble). Thus OSHAagrees with the ACGIH that ``it seems unlikely that all the hexanes wouldfollow the same metabolic route in the body [as n-hexane], in view of themarked variations in structure of the molecule'' (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.307). The majority of commenters supported OSHA's conclusion that n-hexaneis uniquely toxic because of the presence of 2,5-hexanedione and that theother alkanes are not toxic in this way (Exs. 3-593, 3-896, and 3-1246).However, the AFL-CIO (Ex. 194, p. A-7) argued for a lower limit for thehexane isomers and all petroleum solvents (see the discussion for heptane,above), and the UAW (Ex. 197) noted that controls are available to reduceexposures (see Section VII for a discussion of feasibility).After reviewing the evidence cited by the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3), NIOSH (1977a/Ex.1-233),and commenters to the record, OSHA finds that workers exposed to hexaneisomers are at significant risk of experiencing narcosis and of developingneuropathy at exposure levels above the new PELs. The Agency concludesthat establishing an 8-hour TWA of 500 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 1000ppm will substantially reduce these risks. OSHA finds that both narcosisand neuropathy constitute material health impairments.<ITAG tagnum="71">ISOAMYL ALCOHOL (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 123-51-3; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2>CHCH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>OH_Primary; (C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>)<T2>2</T2>CHOH_Secondary</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1218 </ITAG>OSHA's former limit for the isoamyl alcohols was 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.The ACGIH has established an 8-hour TLV-TWA of 100 ppm and a 15-minuteSTEL of 125 ppm for these substances, which are colorless liquids thathave pungent tastes and an alcoholic odor that causes coughing. OSHA proposedto retain the 8-hour TWA limit of 100 ppm and to add a 125-ppm 15-minuteSTEL; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs with these limits. The final ruleretains the 100-ppm 8-hour TWA and adds a 125-ppm STEL for isoamyl alcohol.In rats, the oral LD<T2>50</T2> for the primary isoamyl alcohol is 7.07 mg/kg (Smyth, Carpenter,Weil et al. 1969/Ex. 1-442). Haggard, Miller, and Greenberg (1945/Ex. 1-956)determined that isoamyl alcohol's anesthetic toxicity was approximately12 times higher than that of ethyl alcohol, which has a TLV-TWA of 1000ppm. Exposure to isoamyl alcohol is not associated with chronic effects.Smyth (1956/Ex. 1-759) reported that the principal effect of inhalationexposure to this substance is narcosis, and that a 100-ppm level wouldprotect exposed workers against significant narcosis but not against someirritation. Nelson, Enge, Ross, and co-workers (1943/Ex. 1-66) stated thatunacclimatized human volunteers reported upper respiratory tract irritationafter brief exposures to an isoamyl alcohol concentration of 100 ppm, andobjectionable eye and mucous membrane irritation at short-term exposuresto 150 ppm. With the exception of NIOSH's submittal, OSHA received no commentson isoamyl alcohol.In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA of 100 ppm and addinga 15-minute STEL of 125 ppm for the isoamyl alcohols (primary and secondary).OSHA concludes that a short-term limit is necessary because the chemicallyinduced eye and throat irritation associated with exposure to the isoamylalcohols is an acute effect that occurs at concentrations only slightlyhigher than the 100-ppm 8-hour TWA; in addition, significant narcosis occursat the levels permitted by the absence of a STEL. The Agency concludesthat both the TWA and STEL limits are necessary to ensure that workersare protected against the material impairments represented by significantnarcosis, as well as the eye, nose, and upper respiratory tract irritationknown to be associated with brief exposures to isoamyl alcohol at levelsabove 100 ppm.<ITAG tagnum="71">ISOPHORONE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 78-59-1: Chemical Formula: C<T2>9</T2>H<T2>14</T2>O</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"> H.S.

The ACGIHhas established a 5-ppm TLV as a ceiling limit, and NIOSH recommends aworkplace standard of 4 ppm as an 8-hour TWA for isophorone. Isophoroneis a colorless liquid at room temperature, and it has a camphor-like odor.The proposed limit was 4 ppm as an 8-hour TWA; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1)concurs. This is the limit promulgated by the final rule.Studies in animals and with human volunteers indicate that exposures tohigh concentrations of isophorone cause nephrotoxic and other adverse effects.A paper by Smyth, Seaton, and Fischer (1942/Ex. 1-378) reported that guineapigs and rats exposed to 550 ppm isophorone for six weeks demonstrateddegenerative changes in the kidneys and liver. At an exposure level of25 ppm, no adverse effects were noted, but at 50 ppm, the liver of oneanimal and the kidneys of four others were damaged. The entire group of20 animals exposed at 50 ppm survived, but 2 of 16 animals died after thislevel was raised to 100 ppm (Smyth, Seaton, and Fischer 1942/Ex. 1-378).Volunteers exposed for a few minutes to isophorone vapor at concentrationsbetween 40 and 400 ppm experienced eye, nose, and throat irritation; severalsubjects exposed at the 200-ppm level developed headache, nausea, faintness,dizziness, and a feeling of suffocation (Smyth and Seaton 1940a/Ex. 1-377).Silverman, Schulte, and First (1946/Ex. 1-142) reported that volunteersexposed to 25 ppm isophorone, the former OSHA PEL, complained of irritationof the eyes, nose, and throat. Another study conducted by the Western ElectricCompany (Ware 1973, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 333) reported thatworkers exposed for a one-month period to levels of 5 to 8 ppm isophoronedemonstrated fatigue and malaise. When the workplace level was reducedto between 1 and 4 ppm, there were no complaints of adverse effects. TheNIOSH criteria document for the ketones (1978f, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 333) notes that all of the ketones are central nervous system depressantsand that workplace exposures to more than one ketone may produce additiveeffects.A comment from the New Jersey Department of Public Health (Ex. 144) urgedOSHA to use EPA's IRIS data to set a limit for isophorone. The use of IRISdata is discussed in Section VI.A.In the final rule, OSHA is reducing its 8-hour TWA PEL of 25 ppm to an8-hour TWA of 4 ppm to protect workers against the significant risk offatigue, nausea, and headaches, which together constitute material healthimpairments that have been demonstrated to occur at isophorone levels between5 and 8 ppm. The Agency concludes that this limit will substantially reducethese occupational risks.<ITAG tagnum="71">METHYL CHLORIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 74-87-3; CHEMICAL FORMULA: CH<T2>3</T2>C1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1254</ITAG>OSHA's former limits for methyl chloride were 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA,200 ppm as a ceiling (not to be exceeded for more than five minutes inany three-hour period), and 300 ppm as a peak. The ACGIH has a 50-ppm 8-hourTLV-TWA limit and a 100-ppm 15-minute STEL for this substance, and NIOSHrecommends the lowest feasible limit because it considers methyl chloridea potential occupational carcinogen. The proposed PELs were 50 ppm as an8-hour TWA and 100 ppm as a 15-minute STEL; the final rule establishesthese limits. Methyl chloride is a colorless, sweet-smelling gas.There is considerable evidence in humans and some in animals demonstratingthat exposure to methyl chloride by inhalation or dermal absorption producesnarcosis and other central nervous system effects, including respiratoryfailure and death (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 380). In animals, repeated exposuresto 500 ppm or to higher concentrations can be life-threatening, but exposuresto 300 ppm for 64 weeks caused no apparent effects (Smith and von Oettingen1947/Ex. 1-527).Reports in earlier literature described by Fairhall (1969a/Ex. 1-848) indicatethat moderate (not further specified) exposure causes ocular symptoms thatmay persist for weeks, while high (not further specified) exposure hassevere effects on the central nervous system. Patty (1963a/Ex. 1-855) statesthat serious exposure causes central nervous system, liver and kidney,and bone marrow effects, with symptoms of ataxia, staggering gait, weakness,tremors, vertigo, speaking difficulty, and blurred vision. Symptoms maybe of several weeks' duration or may even be permanent (Patty 1963a/Ex.1-855).The Dow Chemical Company (as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 380) studiedthe methyl chloride exposures of employees in 54 job classifications overa four-month period. Exposures ranged from 5 to 78 ppm methyl chloride(8-hour TWAs), averaged 30 ppm over the work shift, and occasionally includedpeaks as high as 440 ppm. Medical examination of these workers revealedno detectable effects of methyl chloride exposure. However, average eight-hourexposures in the range of 195 to 475 ppm caused symptoms of weakness, drowsiness,staggering gait, thickness of the tongue, and memory lapses in some ofthe exposed employees (Dow Chemical Company, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 380).In a study of six cases of industrial methyl chloride poisoning, workerschronically exposed to levels between 200 and 400 ppm developed neurotoxicsymptoms after two or more weeks of exposure (Scharnweber, Spears, andCowles 1974/Ex. 1-664). Symptoms included drowsiness, dizziness, mentalconfusion, clouded vision, staggering gait, and slurred speech, and symptomssometimes recurred after apparent recovery and in the absence of renewedexposure.Repko and co-workers (1976/Ex. 1-1165) found that workers exposed to concentrationsof methyl chloride ranging from 7.4 to 70 ppm but averaging 33.6 ppm displayeda significant performance decrement, and that exposures below 100 ppm producedsignificant but transitory changes in functional capacity. OSHA will continueto monitor the toxicological evidence for methyl chloride and will re-evaluatethe substance if this evidence suggests that this is appropriate.OSHA received comments on methyl chloride from NIOSH and the Methyl ChlorideIndustry Association. NIOSH believes that methyl chloride is an appropriatesubstance for a section 6(b) rulemaking because, in NIOSH's view, methylchloride is a potential occupational carcinogen (Ex. 8-47; Tr. 3, pp. 97-98).The AFL-CIO (Ex. 194) agrees with NIOSH on this point. The Methyl ChlorideIndustry Association (MCIA) indicated its support of OSHA's proposed PELsfor this substance and submitted material suggesting that methyl chloridemay not be a potential occupational carcinogen (Ex. 148, pp. 2-4). MCIAsubmitted to the record a copy of the IARC monograph and recent supplementon methyl chloride, which conclude that the evidence for the carcinogenicityof methyl chloride is inadequate in both animals and humans.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 50 ppm and a 15-minuteSTEL of 100 ppm for methyl chloride. The Agency concludes that these twolimits together will substantially reduce the significant risk of neurotoxiceffects, including functional impairment, performance decrements, headaches,dizziness, slurred speech, and staggering gait, which together constitutematerial impairments of health. These effects have been associated withexposure to this substance at the levels permitted by OSHA's former PEL.OSHA will continue to monitor the literature on the toxicity of methylchloride to determine whether other action is appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="71">METHYL CHLOROFORM (1.1.1-TRICHLOROETHANE)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 71-55-6; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CC1<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1255</ITAG>Previously, OSHA had an 8-hour TWA limit of 350 ppm for methyl chloroform.The ACGIH has established the same TWA limit in addition to a TLV-STELof 450 ppm; NIOSH recommends a 15-minute ceiling limit of 350 ppm. TheAgency proposed to retain its 8-hour TWA limit and to add a STEL of 450ppm; NIOSH concurs that these limits are appropriate but would expressthem as ceilings rather than as TWAs (Ex. 8-47, Table N7). The final ruleretains an 8-hour TWA of 350 ppm and adds a STEL of 450 ppm for methylchloroform, which is a clear, nonflammable liquid.The primary health effects associated with exposure to methyl chloroformare anesthesia and cardiac sensitization. The oral toxicity of methyl chloroformis low, with LD<T2>50</T2> values ranging from 5.7 to 12.3 g/kg for rats, mice, rabbits,and guinea pigs. This substance does, however, defat the skin on contact,causing redness and scaling (Torkelson, Oyen, McCollister, and Rowe 1958/Ex.1-768). Skin absorption is relatively insignificant: The acute precutaneousLD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is greater than 16 g/kg, and slight, reversibleirritation was observed from applications of 0.5 g/kg to rabbit skin for90 days (Torkelson, Oyen, McCollister, and Rowe 1958/Ex. 1-768). Repeatedexposures of animals to concentrations between 1000 and 10,000 ppm forthree months produced anesthesia and lung and liver damage in some species,but exposure to 500 ppm of methyl chloroform vapor for seven hours daily,five days/week for six months caused no toxic changes in guinea pigs, rabbits,or monkeys (Torkelson, Oyen, McCollister, and Rowe 1958/Ex. 1-768). Otheranimal studies (Gehring 1968/Ex. 1-637; Plaa, Evans, and Hine 1958/Ex.1-754; Rowe, Wujkowski, Wolf et al. 1963/Ex. 1-687) have reported thatmethyl chloroform has low hepatotoxicity, but cardiac sensitization hasoccurred at high doses (5000 to 10,000 ppm) (Rennick, Malton, Moe, andSeevers 1949/Ex. 1-864; Trochimowicz, Reinhardt, Mullin et al. 1976/Ex.1-992). Tests in rats and mice for teratogenicity and carcinogenicity havedemonstrated negative results (Schwetz, Leong, and Gehring 1975/Ex. 1-757;NIOSH 1976m, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 382; Weisberger 1977/Ex.1-694).In humans, it has been reported that anesthetic effects may begin to occurat methyl chloroform concentrations approaching 500 ppm (Stewart, Gay,Schaffer et al. 1969/Ex. 1-529). Deaths from anesthesia and/or cardiacsensitization have been noted in employees working in confined areas (Patty1963d/Ex. 1-856). Kramer and co-workers (1978/Ex. 1-515) conducted an epidemiologicalstudy of men and women exposed for periods ranging from several monthsto six years to methyl chloroform at levels that occasionally exceeded200 ppm; when compared to matched-pair controls, no adverse exposure-relatedeffects were found (Kramer, Ott, Fulkerson et al. 1978/Ex. 1-515).Commenters supplied conflicting evidence to the record on the toxicityof methyl chloroform. The Workers Institute for Safety and Health (WISH)(Ex. 116, Tr. pp. 7-134, 135) noted that there is an extensive amount ofrecent information on this substance. In particular, WISH mentioned threerecent studies (McLeod et al. 1987, Karlsson et al. 1987, and Mackay etal. 1987) that demonstrate that methyl chloroform causes chronic cardiactoxicity on long-term exposure, may have toxic effects on brain cells,and may cause behavioral changes after 3.5-hour exposures to 175 to 350ppm. WISH believes that these studies and others warrant a further reductionin the PELs for methyl chloroform. However, the Halogenated Solvents IndustryAlliance (Ex. 186) criticized these studies and believes that the PELsfor methyl chloroform are appropriate.In the final rule, OSHA is retaining its PEL of 350 ppm as an 8-hour TWAand adding a STEL of 450 ppm for methyl chloroform. The Agency concludesthat this combined PEL-STEL limit will protect workers against the significantrisk of narcotic and cardiac-sensitizing effects, which constitute materialhealth impairments that are potentially associated with exposure to methylchloride at the elevated short-term levels permitted by an 8-hour TWA limitalone.<ITAG tagnum="71">OCTANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 111-65-9; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>(CH<T2>2</T2>)<T2>6</T2>CH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1296</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for octane was 500 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. The ACGIHhas a 300-ppm TWA and a 375-ppm STEL; NIOSH (1977a/Ex. 1-233) recommendsa 75-ppm 10-hour TWA and a 385-ppm 15-minute ceiling limit. The proposedPELs were an 8-hour TWA of 300 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 375 ppm, andthese are the limits promulgated in the final rule. n-Octane is a colorless,flammable liquid with an odor like that of gasoline.Mice exposed to octane concentrations of 6600 to 13,700 ppm developed narcosiswithin 30 to 90 minutes (Fuhner 1921, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.448). Flury and Zernik (1931h, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 448) believedthe narcotic concentration in humans to be 5000 ppm; Patty and Yant (1929,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 448) placed the narcotic concentrationat 8000 ppm. Based on this information, the ACGIH concluded that octanewas 1.2 to 2 times more toxic than heptane, and recommended TLVs of 300ppm TWA and 375 ppm STEL.As discussed in more detail in Section V of the preamble and in the discussionsabove for the other C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes, the NIOSH (1977a/Ex. 1-233) recommended limits foroctane are based on NIOSH's belief that all C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes present a neurotoxic hazard similar to that of n-hexane.OSHA disagrees with this conclusion and has found instead that the neurotoxicproperties of n-hexane are unique among the substances in the alkane series.NIOSH continues to recommend these lower limits for all of the C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes, including octane (Ex. 8-47, Table N2; Tr. 3-86 to 122).The AFL-CIO (Ex. 194) and the UAW (Ex. 197) made the same comments foroctane as for heptane (see the discussion, above).The Chevron Corporation (Ex. 3-896) objected to the proposed short-termexposure limit for octane on the grounds that studies showing narcosisat concentrations of 5000 and 8000 ppm do not provide a justification fora STEL. In addition, Chevron stated that, ``as a practical matter, a STELthat is only 25 percent greater than the TWA value suggests a level ofprecision that simply does not exist in exposure assessment techniques.Variations in sampling and analytical methodologies combined with normalstatistical variability in exposure patterns make it impossible to reliablydistinguish between exposures that differ by only 20 to 25 percent. Intuitively,it is not reasonable to conclude that a concentration that is slightlyabove an acceptable 8-hour exposure level would be unsafe for a 15-minuteexposure'' (Ex. 3-896. p. 3).In response to Chevron, OSHA notes that octane is considered more toxicthan heptane, for which OSHA is establishing limits of 400 ppm as an 8-hourTWA and 500 ppm as a 15-minute STEL. Short-term effects have been observedin humans and animals exposed to the hexane isomers at levels below 500ppm (Nelson, Enge, Ross et al. 1943/Ex. 1-66), and OSHA finds it appropriateto establish a STEL for octane and several other alkanes to protect againstthese narcotic effects. OSHA disagrees with Chevron that it is not possibleto distinguish between octane exposures of 300 ppm and those of 375 ppm;although a andplusmin; 25-percent level of precision may be difficult toachieve at very low contaminant concentrations, there should be no samplingand analytical difficulty at the levels being considered here. Finally,OSHA notes that a theoretically possible, although unlikely, exposure scenariothat could occur with an 8-hour TWA limit of 300 ppm alone would be anexcursion of up to 9600 ppm; such an exposure could produce serious CNSeffects in exposed workers. Thus, the purpose of the 375-ppm STEL is toensure that the TWA limit is not exceeded for any substantial period oftime and that exposures are effectively controlled.In the final rule, OSHA is revising its limits for octane to 300 ppm asan 8-hour TWA and 375 ppm as a 15-minute STEL. The Agency concludes thatthese limits will protect workers from the significant risks of narcosis,a material health impairment that is associated with octane exposures.OSHA believes that these limits will substantially reduce these significantrisks.<ITAG tagnum="71">PENTANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 109-66-0; Chemical Formula: C<T2>5</T2>H<T2>12</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1306</ITAG>Previously, OSHA's limit for pentane was 1000 ppm TWA. In 1976, the ACGIHadopted a 600-ppm TLV-TWA and a 750-ppm TLV-STEL. NIOSH (1977a/Ex. 1-233;Ex. 8-47, Table N2) has recommended that workplace exposures to pentanenot exceed 120 ppm as a 10-hour TWA and 610 ppm as a 15-minute short-termlimit. The proposed and final rule PELs are 600 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and750 ppm as a 15-minute STEL. Pentane, a colorless, flammable liquid witha gasoline-like odor, is usually encountered in volatile petroleum fractions,some of which are used as solvents. Pure pentrane is used as a blowingagent for plastics, in solvent extraction, and in ice manufacture.Fairhall (1957c/Ex. 1-184) stated that narcosis and mucous membrane irritationwere the only reported toxic effects resulting from exposure to pentane.The reported lethal concentration in humans is 130,000 ppm (Flury and Zernik1931j/Ex. 1-994; Swann, Kwon, and Hogan 1974/Ex. 1-124). According to Pattyand Yant (1929, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 463), humans exposedfor 10 minutes to 5000 ppm did not complain of any adverse symptoms.In a report by Gaultier, Rancurel, Piva, and Efthymioc (1973/Ex. 1-123),five cases of polyneuropathy occurred among employees exposed to a solventcontaining 80 percent pentane, 14 percent heptane, and 5 percent hexane.Based largely on this report, NIOSH (1977a/Ex. 1-233) recommended the sameoccupational limit for all C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes as for the neurophatic agent n-hexane (350-mg/m\3\ TWAand 1800-mg/m\3\ 15-minute short-term limits; these limits are equal toabout 120-ppm TWA and 610-ppm 15-minute short-term limits for pentane).OSHA points out that the rationale used by NIOSH in setting a limit forpentane ignores the theory that n-hexane is uniquely neuropathic via metabolismto 2,5-hexanedione, which is the same metabolite that is formed duringexposure to another neuropathic agent, methyl butyl ketone (see the discussionin Section V of this preamble). OSHA finds that all C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes are not equally toxic; the Agency concludes that a metaboliteof n-hexane exhibits unique neurotoxic properties. In OSHA's view, theGaultier, Rancurel, Piva, and Efthymioc (1973/Ex. 1-123) study does notprovide specific isomer exposure data supporting the NIOSH RELs of 120ppm (TWA) and 610 ppm (STEL).The Chevron Corporation (Ex. 3-896) objected to the proposed STEL for pentanebecause, in Chevron's opinion, the health evidence did not justify thisaddition. However, OSHA finds that the STEL is needed to protect workersfrom the significant neurotoxic effects of pentane exposure by ensuringthat the high short-term excursions possible in the absence of a STEL donot occur. The Workers Institute for Safety and Health (Ex. 116) and theUAW (Ex. 197) submitted the same comments on pentane as on heptane (whichsee).In the final rule, the Agency is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 600 ppmand a 15-minute STEL of 750 ppm as the permissible exposure limits forpentane. OSHA concludes that these limits will protect exposed workersfrom the narcosis long known to be associated with pentane exposure; theAgency finds that narcosis constitutes a material health impairment withinthe meaning of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="71">2-PENTANONE (METHYL PROPYL KETONE)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-87-9; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>COC<T2>3</T2>H<T2>7</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1307</ITAG>The former OSHA limit for 2-pentanone was 200 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. TheACGIH has a 200-ppm TLV-TWA and a 250-ppm TLV-STEL; NIOSH (1978k, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 408) has recommended a 150-ppm limit as a 10-hourTWA. The proposed PELs were 200 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 250 ppm as a 15-minuteSTEL, and these limits are established in the final rule. 2-Pentanone isa clear, flammable liquid with a strong odor resembling acetone and ether.Both the ACGIH- and NIOSH-recommended limits are based on a study by Specht,Miller, Valaer, and Sayers (1940/Ex. 1-1179), which found that guinea pigsexhibited irritation and weakness on exposure to 2500 ppm, and that exposureto 5000 ppm produced narcosis and coma. The authors concluded that 2-pentanoneis considerably less toxic than methyl butyl ketone but is more toxic thanmethyl ethyl ketone, and, in addition, is likely to be more irritatingthan either methyl ethyl ketone or acetone. The ACGIH-recommended limitsare based on a judgment that the 200-ppm TLV-TWA and 250-ppm TLV-STEL arelow enough to prevent narcosis and irritation.NIOSH (1978k, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 408) applied the findingsof the Specht, Miller, Valaer, and Sayers (1940/Ex. 1-1179) study to theresults of the Nelson, Enge, Ross et al. study (1943/Ex. 1-66); these latterauthors reported that volunteers complained of slight irritation on exposureto 100 ppm methyl ethyl ketone. Because 2-pentanone was found by Specht,Miller, Valaer, and Sayers (1940/Ex. 1-1179) to be at least as irritatingas methyl ethyl ketone, NIOSH (1978k, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.408) stated that a ``slight reduction'' in the standard was warranted for2-pentanone. Therefore, NIOSH recommended a 150-ppm limit for 2-pentanone,and NIOSH reiterates this recommendation in the present rulemaking (Ex.8-47, Table N2; Tr. 3-86). No other comments were submitted regarding thehealth effects of 2-pentanone.OSHA has concluded that the combination of a 200-ppm TWA and a 250-ppmSTEL will work together to ensure that workplace levels are maintainedat levels that will prevent the occurrence of the adverse health effectsassociated with exposures to this chemical. In the final rule, OSHA isestablishing these limits to reduce the significant risks of narcosis,a material impairment of health, which is associated with exposures to2-pentanone at elevated short-term levels.<ITAG tagnum="71">STODDARD SOLVENT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 8052-41-3; Chemical Formula: C<T2>9</T2>H<T2>20</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1371</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for Stoddard solvent was 500 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.The ACGIH has established a TLV-TWA of 100 ppm, and NIOSH (1977g, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 537) recommends limits of 350 mg/m\3\ as a 10-hourTWA and 1800 mg/m\3\ as a 15-minute ceiling for all refined petroleum solvents;these limits correspond approximately to a 60-ppm TWA and a 310-ppm STEL,respectively. Stoddard solvent is a refined petroleum solvent having aflash point in the range of 102 to 110 anddegrees;F, a boiling point in therange of 154 to 202 anddegrees;C, and containing 65 percent or more C<T2>10</T2> and higher-molecular-weight hydrocarbons. OSHA proposed toreduce its 8-hour TWA to 100 ppm, and the final rule promulgates this limit.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) agreed with the Agency's selection of this PEL.The former OSHA limit of 500 ppm (equivalent to the limit in the 1968 ACGIHTLV list) was based largely on analogy to the irritant and narcotic effectsof gasoline vapor in humans (ACGIH 1966/Ex. 1-13, pp. 176-177). The revisedACGIH limit of 100 ppm was based on a report by Carpenter, Geary, Myerset al. (1978/Ex. 1-301), which found slight kidney damage among rats exposedto 330 ppm Stoddard solvent for 65 days. The ACGIH TLV for Stoddard solventwas calculated from the TLVs for nonane and trimethyl benzene, the majorcomponents of Stoddard solvent (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3); the TLV for nonaneis 200 ppm, based on the Carpenter, Geary, Myers et al. (1978/Ex. 1-301)study's findings of a non-effect level for nonane in rats of 590 ppm, whilethe TLV for trimethyl benzene is 25 ppm, because there is evidence thathumans exposed to the isomers of trimethyl benzene exhibited central nervoussystem effects (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3).THE ACGIH (1986/Ex. 10-3, p. 537) notes that guinea pigs exposed for 30eight-hour days to 290 ppm Stoddard sovlent developed congestion and emphysemaof the lungs. The eye irritation threshold in humans is approximately 150ppm for 15 minutes (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 537).The NIOSH limits of a 350-mg/m\3\ (60-ppm) TWA and an 1800-mg/m\3\ (310-ppm)15-minute short-term limit are derived from NIOSH's recommended limitsfor all of the C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes; NIOSH recommended the same limit for Stoddard solventas for all C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes both because of the lack of scientific data on Stoddardsolvent's chronic effects and because of a report of polyneuropathy occurringamong workers exposed to jet fuels containing mixtures of kerosene andgasoline. NIOSH reasoned that, although the C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes present in jet fuel may have been implicated, it waspossible that the heavier hydrocarbon components may also have been responsible.Thus, the NIOSH recommended limits for Stoddard solvent reflect a concernthat higher-molecular-weight hydrocarbons may be neuropathic. However,no evidence exists that the C<T2>10</T2> and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons cause neuropathies.NIOSH has re-examined the health evidence for Stoddard solvent in thisrulemaking and concurs with OSHA that the 100-ppm 8-hour TWA limit is appropriatefor this substance (Ex. 8-47, Table N1). Several commenters (TR. 7-70 to7-95; Exs. 46, 116, 194, 197) urged OSHA to reevaluate the final rule'slimits for this substance because recent evidence points to hepatic andhematopoietic effects. OSHA is aware of the emerging literature and willmonitor developments in the future.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 100 ppm to reducethe significant risk, of eye irritation, narcosis, polyneuropathy, andkidney damage, all of which constitute material health impairments thathave been demonstrated to occur in either humans or animals at levels wellbelow the former PEL. OSHA finds that the study of Carpenter and co-workers(1978/Ex. 1-301) in animals and the study reported by the ACGIH showingthat exposed workers develop eye irritation at levels of 150 ppm and aboveclearly indicate that a reduced PEL is needed for Stoddard solvent to diminishthese significant occupational risks. <ITAG tagnum="71">STYRENE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 100-42-5; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>CH-CH<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1372</ITAG>OSHA's former exposure limits for styrene (listed in 29 CFR 1910.1000,Table Z-2) were 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, 200 ppm as a STEL, not to beexceeded for more than 5 minutes in any 3-hour period, and 600 ppm as aceiling limit. OSHA proposed revising these limits to 50 ppm as an 8-hourTWA and 100 ppm as a 15-minute STEL, based on both the ACGIH TLVs and theNIOSH RELs, which are identical. NIOSH (Ex. 150, Comments on Styrene) concursthat these limits are appropriate for styrene, and they are establishedin the final rule. Styrene monomer is a colorless, oily liquid with anaromatic odor. In the proposal, styrene was located in the cancer category; in the finalrule, it has been moved into the narcotics section, for the reasons discussedbelow. According to the generic methodology used by OSHA to group the 428substances included in this rulemaking, substances were grouped accordingto the guidelines given by the ACGIH for assigning an appropriate exposurelimit for a particular substance. In other words, if the ACGIH noted thata particular TLV was designed to protect against irritant effects, thatsubstance was classified by OSHA in the sensory irritant category. Thisclassification scheme was chosen by OSHA because it facilitated the rulemakingprocess (made unusually complex by the broad scope of the issues addressed)and made the discussion of hundreds of substances easier. However, as isoften the case with classification schemes, this methodology oversimplifiesthe issues, particularly in those situations where a substance has morethan one serious health effect. Styrene is a case in point. This widely used substance is an irritant,a narcotic, and a neuropathic agent; some studies also show that animalsexposed to styrene vapor develop tumors. the ACGIH <T3>Documentation</T3> (1986/Ex.1-3) for styrene states:<ITAG tagnum="21">[A] time-weighted average TLV of 50 ppm, one-tenth the lowest concentrationpossibly causing <T3>lymphoid or hematopoietic tumors</T3> in female rats, and a STEL of100 ppm are suggested as reasonable limits [for styrene] (emphasis added)(ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 539).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Because the ACGIH limit had been set with reference to tumorigenicity(notwithstanding the lack of an A1 or A2 cancer designation), styrene fellinto the category of carcinogens for the purposes of the proposal (53 FR21202). Many commenters objected to the proposal's classification of styrene asa carcinogen (Exs. 3-741, 3-742, 3-1059, L3-1312B, 8-12, 8-32, 8-48, 8-54,34, 36, 103, 155, and 187; Tr. 8/3/88, pp 5-9 to 5-127; Tr. pp. 11-265,11-266). For example, the Styrene Information and Research Council (SIRC)stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">Regarding the long-term animal studies on styrene * * * there havebeen nine * * * seven of which were via the oral route and two via inhalation* * * . All of these studies showed either no evidence of cancer or gaveinconclusive results due to study limitations, e.g., faulty study design,high background tumor incidence and/or high morbidity in test and controlgroups of animals (Ex. 3-742, p. 10).</ITAG>Other commenters echoed the view of the SIRC. For example, a paper preparedby the Epidemiology Department of the Dow Chemical Company and reportedon in Dow's prehearing submission (Ex. 3-741, p. 55) concludes: ``[O]verallthese data do not support a causal link between lymphatic and hematopoieticcancer and styrene.'' Dr. Gregory Bond (Ex. 103 and testimony) also criticizedthe epidemiology studies relied on by OSHA in the proposal, as did theChemical Manufacturers Association (Ex. 8-54). J. Roger Crawford, Directorof Environmental Control for the Outboard Marine Corporation, a manufacturerof outboard and inboard engines, lawn care equipment, and marine products,commented that OSHA's conclusion in the proposal about the carcinogenicityof styrene ``is clearly outside the mainstream of most scientific opinion''(Ex. 8-12, p. 3). In posthearing testimony on behalf of the SIRC, Dr. Robert G. Tardiff,Director of Versar, Incorporated's Risk Focus Division, described the commentsof EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) on a draft EPA <T3>Water Criteria Document on Styrene.</T3> Dr. Tardiff reported thatthe SAB had advised EPA to consider styrene a ``possible human carcinogen(Category C) at best'' (Ex. 34, p. 4). Dr. Tardiff further commented thatthe Category C classification ``would generally lead EPA to regulate thecompound based on protection against non-cancer pathology'' (Ex. 34, pp.4-5). However, EPA's <T3>Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment </T3>(51 FR 33992) interpretthe meaning of a Category C designation somewhat differently than doesDr. Tardiff. In a letter dated March 9, 1988 from the SAB to EPA's Administrator,Lee M. Thomas (Attachment to Ex. 124), the SAB makes clear that factorsother than category are important to consider for regulatory purposes:<ITAG tagnum="21">From a scientific point of view, it seems inappropriate for EPA andother agencies to regulate substances that are classified as B2 [probablehuman carcinogens] and not to consider regulation of compounds classifiedas C * * *. A substance classified as C (limited evidence in animals) forwhich human exposure is high may represent a much greater potential threatto human health [than substances with classifications of B2, B1, or A whereexposures are lower]. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">EPA and other agencies * * * may, therefore, wish to take steps toreduce high exposures to substances in the C category whenever there appearsto be a potentially significant threat to human health (in the sense [whererisk estimates are] * * * above the threshold where regulation may be judgedappropriate) (Attachment to Ex. 124).</ITAG>Several animal and human studies have suggested that styrene may be a carcinogen.A nested case-control study conducted by McMichael, Spirta, Gamble, andTousey (1976/Ex. 1-206) found significantly increased risks of lymphaticand hematopoietic cancer, lymphatic leukemia, and stomach cancer amongworkers exposed to both styrene and butadiene. A retrospective cohort mortalitystudy by Meinhardt, Lemen, Crandall, and Young (1982/Ex. 1-199), also amongworkers exposed concurrently to styrene and butadiene, reported an excessrisk of leukemia and aleukemia. In a study sponsored by the Chemical ManufacturersAssociation (Dow 1978, as cited in EPA 1987/Ex. 1-836), male and femaleSprague-Dawley rats were exposed to styrene vapor at concentrations of600 to 1200 ppm, six hours per day, five days per week, for 18 or 20 months.The higher exposure level was reduced to 1000 ppm after the first two monthsof exposure because of excessively reduced weight in the male rats. A statisticallysignificant increased incidence of mammary tumors was reported in low-dosefemale rats (7 of 87) compared with controls (1 of 85); no increase inmammary tumors was reported among high-dose female rats. The authors questionedthe significance of this response, since historical control animals fromthe same laboratory showed a higher background incidence of mammary tumorsthan did the controls used in this study. In a 1979 NCI study (NCI 1979b/Ex. 1-948), male and female B6C3F1 miceand Fischer 344 rats were treated by gavage five days per week for 78 weeks(low-dose rat groups were treated for 103 weeks). The study was terminatedat 91 weeks for mice and at 104 to 105 weeks for rats. Dose-related increasesin alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas and carcinomas were observed only in thelow-dose (150 mg/kg) and high dose (300 mg/kg) male mice; the incidenceof tumors for vehicle controls, low-dose, and high-dose male mice was 0/20,6/44, and 9/43, respectively. Although the historical incidence of tumorsamong untreated controls was 12 percent (32/271), the historical incidenceof vehicle controls was 0/40.  However, the human studies cannot be used to demonstrate styrene's carcinogenicitybecause there were confounding exposures in these cohorts to butadiene,a substance identified by the NTP as carcinogenic. The animal studies alsohave limitations, such as high background rates of cancer in the controlsand non-treatment-related mortality in some of the test animals.  Thus, at this time, OSHA believes that the current evidence on styrene'scarcinogenicity does not support its classification in the final rule asa carcinogen. OSHA has reviewed additional evidence and has determinedthat the most appropriate basis for classifying styrene in this rulemakingis the substance's demonstrated narcotic effects. In its criteria document(1983a), NIOSH agrees that styrene is primarily a narcotic and central-nervous-systemtoxin:<ITAG tagnum="21">The principal health effects due to styrene exposure involve the centralnervous system. These effects include subjective complaints of headache,fatigue, dizziness, confusion, drowsiness, malaise, difficulty in concentrating,and a feeling of intoxication * * *. There have also been reports of liverinjury, peripheral nervous system dysfunction, abnormal pulmonary function,chromosomal changes, reproductive effects, and carcinogenicity relatedto styrene exposures. Although data concerning these latter adverse effectsare not well defined at this time, they do provide cause for concern (NIOSH1983a, p. 150).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Accordingly, OSHA has placed the health-effects discussion for styrenein the preamble section labeled ``Narcotic Effects'' in this final rule. OSHA proposed to reduce its former exposure limits for styrene to 50 ppmas an 8-hour TWA and 100 ppm as a 15-minute STEL. The Agency finds clearevidence, based on styrene's narcotic effects, to support these limits.Richard Olsen, representing the Dow Chemical Company, agrees, and statedat the hearing that 50 ppm is likely to be the most ``appropriate'' limitfor styrene (Tr. 3, pp. 250, 251). There is a considerable body of health-effectsinformation in humans for styrene in the toxicological literature. Subjectsexposed at 800 ppm for four hours experienced eye and throat irritationand also reported listlessness, drowsiness, and impaired balance (NIOSH1983a, p. 150). At a concentration of 376 ppm, five human volunteers experiencedeye and respiratory tract irritation within 20 minutes and demonstrateddecrements in motor function (NIOSH 1983a, p. 150). Three subjects exposedto 100 ppm of styrene for 90 minutes had slower reaction times; on repeatedexposure, sleepiness, fatigue, headache, difficulty in concentration, malaise,nasal irritation, and nausea occurred in another group of subjects (NIOSH1983a, p. 150).  Effects attributable to central nervous system depression were seen ina six-week study involving human subjects exposed to 20, 100, or 125 ppmstyrene; the authors of the study reported visual-evoked-response and electroencephalogramchanges in these subjects (NIOSH 1983a, p. 150). Other studies report irritationof the eyes and throat at concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 ppm (NIOSH1983a, p. 151).  Workers in reinforced plastics (RP) facilities in many countries have alsoevidenced narcotic effects as a consequence of styrene exposure. Swedish,Dutch, and Czechoslovakian workers in RP plants complained of headache,fatigue, drowsiness, giddiness, and dizziness at exposure levels in therange of 4 to 195 ppm (NIOSH 1983a, p. 151).  Respiratory effects were observed in U.S. RP workers exposed to from 9to 111 ppm styrene; symptoms included wheezing, shortness of breath, andchest tightness. Another study showed a significantly greater number ofRP workers with abnormal pulmonary function when compared with workersfrom a nonstyrene facility (NIOSH 1983a, p. 154).  NIOSH concluded, based on its extensive review of the health-effects literaturefor styrene, that an 8-hour TWA exposure limit of 50 ppm was appropriateto protect against the health effects observed in workers exposed to styreneat levels of 100 ppm and below. NIOSH also recommends a STEL of 100 ppmfor styrene to prevent acute eye and upper-respiratory-tract irritation(NIOSH 1983a, p. 156). The State of New Jersey's Department of Public Health(Ex. 144) urged OSHA to derive a PEL for styrene on the basis of EPA'sIRIS data, but this approach was criticized by other commenters (Ex. 187).The use of IRIS data for limit-setting purposes is addressed in SectionVI.A of the preamble. At the hearing, representatives of the InternationalChemical Workers Union urged OSHA to adopt a lower PEL because considerablerisk remains at the 50-ppm level (Tr. 9, p. 216). However, the AFL-CIO(Ex. 194) agrees with NIOSH that the 50-ppm and 100-ppm TWA and STEL limitsare appropriate.  OSHA finds that workplace exposures to styrene are associated with healtheffects ranging from narcosis to neuropathies and irritation, which togetherconstitute material impairments of health. The Agency finds that an 8-hourTWA of 50 ppm and a STEL of 100 ppm are necessary to protect against thesesignificant risks of material health impairment. The Agency also notesthat large chemical companies (for example, Rohm and Haas and the Dow ChemicalCompany) have already established internal corporate limits of 25 to 50ppm (8-hour TWAs) for styrene to protect their workers from the range ofserious health effects associated with exposure to this substance (Ex.25, Appendix II, pp. 1-3).  Some commenters (Ex. 155; Tr. p. 10-111) pointed to the fact that the Stateof Washington has not yet adopted a 50-ppm limit for styrene as evidenceof this limit's infeasibility; however, OSHA notes that Stephen Cant, forthe State of Washington's Department of Public Health, stated that hisdepartment was monitoring the health evidence for styrene and consideredthe State's 100-ppm limit an ``incremental improvement'' (Tr. 2, pp. 105,106).OSHA notes that, with the exception of two operations in a single industry(i.e., the boat-building industry), these limits have been found to beachievable with engineering and work-practice controls in all styrene-usingoperations, including styrene manufacture and other reinforced-plasticsoperations. OSHA finds that general dilution ventilation, local exhaustventilation, and process enclosure can be used effectively in tub, shower,and diving board manufacturing because the size and configuration of theseitems lend themselves to effective control. However, in two operations,manual layup and sprayup, in the boat-building industry, there is insufficientdata in this record to indicate that compliance can generally be achievedwith engineering and work-practice controls. For these boat-building operations,employers may use any combination of engineering controls, work practices,and respiratory protection to achieve these limits (see the discussionin Section VII of this preamble). For these operations, engineering controlsand work practices will only be required to achieve full compliance withthe final rule's PELs in cases where the Assistant Secretary can demonstratethat engineering controls and work practices can generally achieve theselimits. In the absence of such a finding, the employer must nonethelessuse engineering controls and work practices to achieve compliance withthe Agency's former PELs for styrene. <ITAG tagnum="71">TOLUENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-88-3; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>CH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1397</ITAG>The former OSHA standard for toluene was 200 ppm as an 8-hour TWA limit,with a 300-ppm ceiling (not to be exceeded for more than 10 minutes inany eight-hour period), and a 500-ppm peak. The ACGIH has an exposure limitfor toluene of 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 150 ppm as a 15-minute STEL;NIOSH recommends a 100-ppm 8-hour TWA and a 10-minute ceiling of 200 ppm.The proposed PELs were 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 150 ppm as a STEL;NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs with these limits, which are establishedin the final rule. Toluene is a flammable, colorless liquid with an aromatichydrocarbon odor. The acute toxicity of toluene in animals is greater than that of benzene.Patty (1963b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 578) reports that thelethal doses of toluene and benzene in mice are 10,000 and 14,000 ppm,respectively. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> for toluene in rats is 7.53 ml/kg (Smyth, Carpenter, Weil etal. 1969/Ex. 1-442). Exposure of rats to 2500 or 5000 ppm of toluene causeda temporary decrease in white cell count but no evidence of damage to theblood-forming organs or the liver. Fairhall (1957d, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 578) stated that severe toluene exposure can cause a marked dropin the red blood cell count and partial destruction of the blood-formingelements of the bone marrow, but other researchers report that numerousanimal studies indicate that toluene is not a bone marrow toxin (Gerarde1960c, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 578).A study by Greenberg, Mayers, Heinmann, and Moskowitz (1942/Ex. 1-325)reported that painters exposed to toluene levels of 100 to 1100 ppm exhibitedenlarged livers, a moderate decrease in red blood cell counts, enlargedred blood cells, and absolute lymphocytosis, but no leukopenia. Wilson(1943/Ex. 1-403) observed 1,000 workers exposed to toluene at levels rangingfrom 50 ppm to 1500 ppm for periods of one to three weeks. One hundredof these workers developed symptoms severe enough to require hospitalization.At levels less than 200 ppm, 60 of these employees experienced headache,fatigue, and lack of appetite. Those workers exposed to 200 to 500 ppmtoluene experienced headache, nausea, bad taste in the mouth, lassitude,temporary amnesia, impaired coordination, and anorexia. Levels of exposurefrom 500 to 1500 ppm resulted in nausea, headache, dizziness, anorexia,marked loss of coordination, diminished reaction time, pronounced weakness,and heart palpitations. Red cell counts were also decreased, and two casesof aplastic anemia required lengthy hospital treatment; however, the authornoted that he could not rule out the possibility that benzene contaminationof the toluene was the cause of these effects. Aplastic anemia (includingone fatal case) has been noted in six glue sniffers; toluene was the basesolvent in the glue (Powars 1965/Ex. 1-433). A man who had inhaled tolueneregularly at unspecified levels for 14 years developed permanent encephalopathy(Knox and Nelson 1966/Ex. 1-421).von Oettingen, Neal, Donahue et al. (1942/Ex. 1-875) exposed human volunteersto toluene levels ranging from 50 ppm to 800 ppm for 8 hours/day. Theseauthors report that exposures to 50 ppm cause drowsiness and headachesand that exposures at 100 ppm result in sleepiness, moderate fatigue, andheadaches. At 200 ppm, effects included impairment of coordination andreaction times. Later studies by Ogata, Tomokuni, and Takatsuka (1970/Ex.1-352) showed an increase in reaction time, a decrease in pulse rate, anda decrease in systolic blood pressure in humans exposed to 200 ppm toluenefor seven hours. The Chevron Corporation (Ex. 3-896) objected to the short-term exposurelimit for toluene as being unjustified by either the discussion in thepreamble or that in the ACGIH <T3>Documentation</T3> (1986/Ex. 1-3). Chevron also urged OSHA to clarifythe proposal's discussion of blood dyscrasias occurring as a result oftoluene exposure because, according to Chevron:<ITAG tagnum="21">[T]he majority of later studies show no such evidence [of blood dyscrasias].Due to the tighter specifications for benzene contamination of toluene,we question whether blood dyscrasias will occur (Ex. 3-896, p. 14).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">As discussed above in connection with octane and pentane, OSHA findsthat a short-term exposure limit is necessary to ensure that workers arenot exposed at the elevated levels possible with a TWA limit alone. Levelsonly slightly above the 8-hour TWA may cause incoordination and amnesia.For example, workers could be exposed to toluene at levels as high as severalhundred ppm if the 8-hour TWA limit was promulgated alone. In addition.OSHA notes that the Agency has always had a short-term and ceiling limitfor toluene, to protect against this substance's narcotic and neuropathiceffects; OSHA continues to find a short-term limit necessary to ensurethat workers do not experience the effects seen at levels only slightlyabove 100 ppm. On the question of blood dyscrasias, OSHA noted in the preambleto the proposal that the author of the study in question (Wilson 1943/Ex.1-403) himself noted that benzene contamination may have been the causeof these blood effects; OSHA agrees that this may have been the case. NIOSH (Ex. 150, Comments on Toluene) reports that ``[s]everal recent studiesindicate measurable biological changes in liver function'' as a consequenceof exposures to 100 ppm (Seiji et al. 1987) but not at 46 ppm (Yin et al.1987). NIOSH also states that volunteers' performance on psychologicaltest scores was reduced during 100-ppm exposures to toluene and that thesevolunteers expressed exposure-related complaints. NIOSH also notes thatthere is some evidence that toluene causes reproductive effects at levelscurrently being experienced in the workplace (NIOSH, Ex. 150, Commentson Toluene). NIOSH concluded that ``there are significant health effectsat the * * * [former] PEL of 200 ppm which will be reduced by the * * *[final rule] PEL of 100 ppm.'' The New Jersey Department of Health, representedby Dr. Rebecca Zagriniski, also notes that there are more recent studieson toluene (Tr. 11-266).In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 100 ppm anda STEL of 150 ppm for toluene. The Agency concludes that studies clearlyindicate that a significant risk of hepatotoxic, behavioral, and nervoussystem effects exists at toluene levels substantially at or only slightlyabove the Agency's former PEL. OSHA finds that the new limits will protectworkers against the significant risk of serious health effects that havebeen demonstrated to occur even during less than full-shift exposures totoluene. <ITAG tagnum="71">TRICHLOROETHYLENE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 79-01-6; Chemical Formula: CCl<T2>2</T2>=CHCl</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1406</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for trichloroethylene, adopted from the American NationalStandards Institute, was 100 ppm TWA, 200 ppm as a ceiling limit not tobe exceeded for more than five minutes every two hours, and 300 ppm asa peak limit. The proposed PEL for trichloroethylene was 25 ppm as an 8-hourTWA, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) supported the proposed limit, whichis consistent with the NIOSH REL. The ACGIH has a 50-ppm TLV-TWA and a200-ppm TLV-STEL for trichloroethylene. Based on its review of the recordevidence, OSHA has determined that a 50-ppm TWA PEL and 200-ppm STEL areappropriate limits for trichloroethylene; the final rule establishes theselimits. Trichloroethylene is a colorless, nonflammable, noncorrosive liquidwith the sweet odor characteristic of some chlorinated hydrocarbons. The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) cited several studies establishing that trichloroethyleneprimarily affects the central nervous system and liver; some of these studieshave indicated that chronic exposure to less than 100 ppm trichloroethyleneis associated with a variety of nervous disturbances. Haas (1960, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 595) and Grandjean, Muchinger, Turrian et al.(1955/Ex. 1-324) reported nervous symptoms among workers exposed for fiveyears or more to trichloroethylene concentrations ranging from 1 to 335ppm; the frequency of complaints increased when average exposures exceeded40 ppm. Bardodej and Vyskocil (1956/Ex. 1-461) also reported symptoms oftrichloroethylene poisoning, including tremors, giddiness, anxiety, andalcohol intolerance, among workers exposed above 40 ppm. In contrast, controlledlaboratory experiments with human subjects exposed for up to several daysto 100 or 200 ppm have generally reported no behavioral or subjective responses.The ACGIH concluded that, although the symptoms reported by workers aresubjective and commonly found among individuals having no chemical exposure,the consistency of the reports ``suggests the possibility of some subjectivecomplaints as concentrations exceed about 50 ppm'' (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 596). Therefore, the ACGIH recommended a TLV-TWA of 50 ppm and a TLV-STELof 200 ppm for trichloroethylene to minimize symptoms of headache, fatigue,and irritability. The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) also reviewed some of the carcinogenicity dataon trichloroethylene. In an NCI bioassay (1976b/Ex. 1-168), mice giventrichloroethylene by gavage developed hepatocellular carcinomas, but ratsdid not. The species difference in response was attributed to a differencein the way trichloroethylene is metabolized between the mouse and rat (Stott,Quast, and Watanabe 1982/Ex. 1-833). An inhalation study in mice, rats,and Syrian hamsters (Henschler, Romen, Reichert et al. 1980/Ex. 1-330)found only an increase in the occurrence of malignant lymphomas in mice,which the authors attributed to the strain of mouse used (NMRI). The ACGIHalso cited a number of epidemiologic investigations having cohorts as largeas 7,688 workers, in which no correlation between cancer mortality andexposure to trichloroethylene was found (Novotna, David, and Malek 1971,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 595; Axelson, Andersson, Hogstedt etal. 1978/Ex. 1-713; Tola, Vilhunen, Jarvinen, and Korkala 1980/Ex. 1-391).After reviewing all of the available health data, NIOSH (1978m/Ex. 1-1121)concluded that the results of the NCI (1976b/Ex. 1-168) gavage study indicatetrichloroethylene (TCE) to be a potential human carcinogen, although NIOSHnoted that TCE was ``not considered to be a potent carcinogen.'' NIOSHalso stated that a 100-ppm limit would not protect against the neuropathicsymptoms, such as headache and fatigue, caused by exposure to trichloroethylene.In support of this conclusion, NIOSH (1978m/Ex. 1-1121) cited three healthhazard evaluations conducted in facilities using trichloroethylene as adegreasing agent. In all three facilities, employees consistently experiencedsymptoms of dizziness, fatigue, nausea, headache, sensory irritation, anddifficulty in breathing. Personal TWA exposures to trichloroethylene rangedfrom 37 to 112 ppm in one plant, 10 to 100 ppm in the second plant, and10 to 95 ppm in the third plant. NIOSH (1978m/Ex. 1-1121) concluded thatthese reports documented the presence of adverse effects caused by acuteexposure to trichloroethylene at levels of one-fourth to one-half the 100-ppmOSHA limit, at 25 to 50 ppm. NIOSH recommended a 25-ppm TWA limit for trichloroethylene based on thehealth hazard reports described above as well as on a NIOSH evaluationof several NIOSH industrial hygiene reports showing that degreasing operations,including those using open-top tanks, are able to achieve 25 ppm uniformlyby the use of engineering controls. NIOSH reasoned that these open-tankoperations would be among the most difficult of all TCE-using operationsto control.     Since publication of the NIOSH (1978m/Ex. 1-1121) report, several recentbioassays on trichloroethylene have been published and are currently beingreviewed by EPA. Fukuda, Takemoto, and Tsuruta (1983/Ex. 1-1109) exposedfemale rats and mice to 50, 150, or 450 ppm trichloroethylene for 103 weeksand reported an increased incidence of lung tumors among mice only. Maltoni,Lefemine, and Cotti (1986/Ex. 1-1160) exposed rats and mice to 100, 300,or 600 ppm trichloroethylene and reported a significant increase of renaladenocarcinomas and Leydig cell tumors in rats, as well as a significantincrease in hepatomas and lung tumors in mice. In 1986, the NTP reportedan increase in the incidence of kidney tumors in rats given trichloroethyleneby gavage; however, the NTP considered the tumor response to be weak (3of 49 animals) and reported that the results were only statistically significantafter corrections for high mortality were made.Based on the information discussed above, OSHA proposed to revise the PELfor trichloroethylene to 25 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. The proposed limit wassupported by NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) and by the AFL-CIO (Ex. 194), which considertrichloroethylene a potential carcinogen. However, the Dow Chemical Companyobjected to this proposed limit on the grounds that:<ITAG tagnum="21">OSHA does not provide justification for reduction of the PEL to 25ppm based on CNS effects. Although NIOSH (1978m/Ex. 1-1121) mentions [the]CNS effects of trichloroethylene, the 25-ppm REL was not based on concernfor these effects * * *. After reviewing the data on the reported [CNSand subjective response] effects of TCE, ACGIH concluded [that] a 50-ppmTWA protects workers from potential adverse effects (Ex. 3-741, pp. 61-62).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Dow also pointed out that neither the ACGIH nor IARC has classifiedtrichloroethylene as a potential carcinogen and that EPA's Science AdvisoryBoard concluded that the weight of evidence for TCE's carcinogenicity ``lieson a continuum between their categories B2 [probable human carcinogen]and C [possible human carcinogen]'' (Ex. 3-741, p. 62). Dow concluded:<ITAG tagnum="21">Since justification for reduction of the PEL below that recommendedby ACGIH has not been provided, based on either CNS effects or carcinogenicity,we recommend adoption of the ACGIH TWA of 50 ppm with a 200-ppm STEL ** * (Ex. 3-741, p. 63).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance (Ex. 8-89, pp. 3-18) expressedan opinion similar to that of Dow Chemical.In its posthearing submission, Dow submitted the written findings of theEPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) on trichloroethylene (letter dated March9, 1988 to Lee M. Thomas, Administrator of EPA, Ex. 106D). In this letter,the SAB concluded that ``[t]richloroethylene has the potential to causecancer in humans, but its potency is low.'' The Science Advisory Boardalso stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The endpoints with the most biological plausibility, based upon whatis known about the effects of structurally related compounds, are liverand lung tumors in mice and renal tumors in rats * * *. While [the incidenceof these tumors] is clearly in excess, [it does] * * * not approach theincidence of 100 percent that occurred for chloroform, for example. Thissuggests a lower or more moderate potency for trichloroethylene (Ex. 106D).</ITAG>OSHA believes that the evidence described above supports OSHA's preliminaryconclusion in the NPRM (53 FR 21013) that the former 100-ppm TWA PEL fortrichloroethylene is insufficiently protective against CNS effects and,further, that exposure to trichloroethylene may present a possible carcinogenichazard. However, OSHA concludes that the evidence for adverse CNS effectsbelow concentrations of 50 ppm is equivocal; exposures exceeding 50 ppmwere found in each of the facilities studied by NIOSH in which symptomsof CNS disturbances were reported. Furthermore, OSHA finds that it is prematureto establish a PEL for trichloroethylene based on evidence of its carcinogenicity,given the uncertainties in the evidence. Therefore, OSHA concludes thatit is appropriate at this time to establish a TWA PEL of 50 ppm and a STELof 200 ppm to reduce the significant risk of adverse CNS effects that areassociated with exposure to trichloroethylene at the former OSHA limits.The Agency considers the adverse effects resulting from exposure to trichloroethyleneto be material impairments of health. Accordingly, the Agency is establishinga 50 ppm TWA PEL and 200 ppm STEL for trichloroethylene in the final rule.Conclusions for This Group of Narcotic AgentsOSHA concludes that workers exposed to these narcosis-causing substancesin the workplace are at significant risk of experiencing a broad rangeof narcotic effects, including loss of consciousness, uncoordinated movements,inability to concentrate, drowsiness, irritability, poor judgement, andinappropriate behavior. These highly undesirable and potentially serioushealth effects, which are viewed by OSHA as material impairments of health,additionally have the potential to cause serious workplace accidents andinjuries because they interfere with reaction times, muscle coordination,and the ability to make good decisions and exercise good judgment. Thenew or revised exposure limits being established by OSHA in the final rulewill protect employees from experiencing these significant risks in theirplaces of work and will contribute to a substantial reduction in theserisks.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Substances for Which Proposed Limits Are Based on Avoidance ofSensory Irritation</ITAG>IntroductionExposure to many chemical agents is associated with the development ofsensory irritation, which is initiated when these substances come intocontact with mucous membrances or skin. Limits have been set for a largegroup of chemicals on the basis of their sensory irritant effects. Thesesubstances, which number 79, are shown in Table C3-1, along with theirformer OSHA limits, the limits proposed by OSHA in the June 7, 1988 NPRM,and the final exposure limits being promulgated today. For five of thesechemicals, OSHA is reducing the 8-hour TWA and for an additional eight,the Agency is both reducing the 8-hour limit and adding a STEL. In 21 cases,the 8-hour limit remains unchanged but a STEL is being added. In eightinstances, a ceiling is being deleted, and this limit is being replacedby an 8-hour TWA and/or STEL value; in five instances, a TWA limit is beingdeleted and a ceiling value added in its place. For one chemical, methyln-amyl ketone, OSHA is retaining its existing PEL. Thirty-one of thesesubstances were previously unregulated by OSHA, and for these, the Agencyis establishing 8-hour limits, 8-hour limits supplemented by a STEL, orceiling limits.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M009</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 380-388</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Description of the Health Effects Irritant effects are readily perceived by affected individuals. The symptomsof sensory irritation include stinging, itching, and burning of the eyes,tearing (or lacrimation), a burning sensation in the nasal passages, rhinitis(nasal inflammation), cough, sputum production, chest pain, wheezing, anddyspnea (breathing difficulty). In the majority of cases, the onset ofsymptoms occurs rapidly upon exposure to the irritant; it is thereforeeasy to associate the causative agent with the irritant effect. These effects may cause severe discomfort and be seriously disabling, asis the case with dyspnea or wheezing. The tearing and eye irritation associatedwith exposure to sensory irritants are often severe and can be as disablingas the weeping caused by exposure to tear gas. In addition to these primaryeffects, workers distracted by material irritant effects are more likelythan nonexposed workers to have accidents and thus to endanger both themselvesand others. (These adverse health effects also clearly have substantialproductivity impacts.) The eye irritation caused by exposure to irritants is believed to resultfrom stimulation of the sensory nerve endings in the cornea. There is littleinformation available on the relationship between the severity of the effectand the physical or chemical properties of the irritating substance. Inaddition, the mechanism of action underlying this irritant effect is notwell understood. Mechanisms that have been suggested include physical actionof the irritant on nerve endings, binding of the irritant to sulfhydrylgroups of protein, inhibition of cellular respiration, and cholinesteraseinhibition (Grant 1986/Ex. 1-975). The symptoms of eye irritation are usuallytransient and do not generally persist after cessation of exposure; however,exposure to concentrations of lacrimators that exceed the levels associatedwith transient eye irritation may produce corneal or conjunctival injurythat requires medical treatment (Grant 1986/Ex 1-975). Sensory irritation of the pulmonary system primarily affects the upperrespiratory tract and causes an increase in sputum production; inflammationof the nasal passages, trachea, and upper bronchial tree; and decreasedcilial clearance. These effects produce a burning sensation in the nasalpassages and throat; coughing; sneezing; and acute bronchitis. The developmentof bronchitis indicates that the cilial clearance mechanism has been compromised,and the resulting mucous retention increases the risk of secondary bacterialinfection. Wheezing may also be apparent, particularly if the affectedindividual has a history of hyperreactive airway disease. If exposure issufficiently intense, the irritant may reach the lower portion of the bronchialtree, causing a chemical burn of the parenchyma and the sudden collectionof fluid in interstitial spaces and alveoli (pulmonary edema). Irritation-inducededema may have a delayed onset (12 hours or more) and can cause hypoxiaand difficulty in breathing. All of the effects described above are consideredto constitute material impairment of health or functional capacity withinthe meaning of the Act. For the great majority of substances in this group, current limits arederived from human evidence that exposure to the chemical agent at a particularairborne concentration will be associated with sensory irritation. Fora few substances in this group, animal evidence provided the basis forlimit setting. Several general types of evidence may be used to reviseexisting limits:<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Consideration of new human evidence; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Reinterpretation of human data that formed the basis forsetting the 1968 TLV; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Consideration of evidence from industrial experience showingthat employees are not experiencing irritation; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Evaluation of new animal evidence.</ITAG>The studies that provide the basis for the sensory irritant levels beingproposed by OSHA are generally controlled-exposure experiments using humanvolunteers or reports of employee complaints arising in industrial settings.Dose-Response Relationships and Sensory Irritation The onset of sensory irritation is considered a ``threshold'' or NOE level;that is, for any sensory irritant, there is an exposure level below whichvery few, if any, individuals will experience sensory irritation. As exposureincreases above this level, a larger proportion of exposed individualswill notice the effect and the effect will become increasingly severe.At some level above this NOEL, all exposed persons will experience sensoryirritation, although the intensity of the response may vary. The risk of experiencing irritation that is associated with exposures belowthe NOEL will be minimal (except in the hypersensitive individual), whilethe risk of experiencing the irritant effect will increase directly asexposure increases. At some point above the NOE level (i.e., at some doseof the substance) the response will be 100 percent, and all exposed personswill experience irritation. According to general toxicologic principles,the shape of the curve that describes responses above the NOEL is sigmoidal,and the steepness of the curve is a function of the variability in individualresponses to the particular irritant. For example, if nearly all personsexposed to the substance will experience a response at approximately thesame concentration (dose), the curve will be steep; if, on the other hand,the percentage of people responding increases only slowly as concentrationrises, the curve will be considerably flatter.      In addition to the relationship between increasing dose and increasingproportion of exposed persons being affected, the intensity of the responsealso increases with increasing exposure level. Slightly above the NOE level,affected individuals will experience itching and burning of the eyes, nose,and throat; this is a transient effect and disappears upon removal fromexposure. For some substances, workers may become inured to the sensationsand higher exposure levels are necessary to elicit a subjective response.As exposure levels increase, the irritant effects become more severe tothe point where objective signs of mucous membrane irritation are apparent(i.e., redness of the eyes, rhinitis, coughing, and lacrimation).During the rulemaking, the question arose as to the level of irritationthat constitutes a significant risk of material health impairment; OSHAposed this question in the NPRM and a discussion of the responses receivedappears earlier in this preamble (see Section V, Question 21). Some commenters(Exs. 3-744 and 3-896) were of the opinion that transient irritant effectsshould not be considered material impairment of health. For example, theU.S. Borax and Chemical Corporation (Ex. 3-744) stated that transient ``rhinitis,cough, sputum production, chest pain, wheezing, and dyspnea'' do not constitutematerial impairments of health.Most commenters, however, recommended that these signs and symptoms beregarded as material health impairments (see, for example, Exs. 8-47, 3-1095,3-660, and 3-593). For example, NIOSH stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The recognition of sensory irritation as potentially being ``materialimpairment of health'' is consistent with the current scientific consensusrelated to health effects of environmental agents.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mucous membrane irritants can cause increased blink frequency andtearing; nasal discharge, congestion, and sneezing; and cough, sputum production,chest discomfort, sneezing, chest tightness, and dyspnea. Work environmentsoften require levels of physical and mental performance considerably greaterthan encountered in daily living. Even in the absence of any permanentimpairment, the symptoms listed can interfere with job performance andsafety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mucous membrane irritation can result in inflammation, which may leadto increased susceptibility to nonspecific irritants and infectious agents.For example, experimental ozone exposure in humans results in increasedairway reactivity. Also, studies of exposure to environmental tobacco smokehave shown irritative symptoms and evidence of increased frequency of respiratorytract illnesses in young children and decreased pulmonary function in adults* * *.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mucous membrane irritation is associated with respiratory illnesses,depending on the composition of specific exposure and on the dose, duration,and frequency of exposure. No universally applicable conclusion can bedrawn at this time regarding the association between irritative symptomsand permanent injury or dysfunction. Where certain individuals show nomeasurable impairment after an exposure, even when experiencing irritativesymptoms, others may develop identifiable dysfunction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Aside from the effects of irritation, mucous membrane exposure mayresult in absorption of a substance, with resultant systemic toxicity.An inflamed mucous membrane may be an even more effective route of absorption,either for the irritant or for other substances. Furthermore, injury tobronchopulmonary membrances can impair removal of particulates from therespiratory system (Ex. 8-47, pp. 38-40).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Thus, according to NIOSH, sensory irritants interfere with job performanceand safety, cause inflammation, may increase the victim's susceptibilityto other irritants and infectious agents, lead to permanent injury or dysfunction,or permit greater absorption of hazardous substances (Ex. 8-47).Another commenter, E.L. DeWitt, an occupational health consultant for thedu Pont Company, remarked:<ITAG tagnum="21">Irritation takes many forms * * * with the effect being perhaps nomore than transient, slight to mild discomfort. Again, this type of irritationneeds to be prevented but the `safety factor' [applied] might be somewhatless in this case. There are also situations where `irritation' is perceivedbut is without any accompanying manifestations. In these cases, there maybe no real need to modify the exposure limit. The exposure conditions requiredto produce these findings need to be considered also (Ex. 3-660, p. 4).</ITAG>OSHA concludes that exposure limits are needed for those substances forwhich PELs are being established in this rulemaking to protect againstsensory irritant effects that result in objective signs of irritation,such as coughing, wheezing, conjunctivitis, and tearing. Such levels ofmucous membrane irritation may require medical treatment, adversely affectthe well-being of employees, and place the affected individual at riskfrom increased absorption of the substance and decreased resistance toinfection. Exposing workers repeatedly to irritants at levels that causesubjective irritant effects may cause workers to become inured to the irritantwarning properties of these substances and thus increase the risk of overexposure.In addition, the long-term effects of repeated low-level sensory irritationhave not been well studied.Therefore, OSHA finds that the sensory irritation caused by exposure tothose substances for which PELs are being established in this rulemakingconstitutes a material impairment of health and functional well-being andhas established exposure limits for these substances at levels that willprotect workers from the significant risk of experiencing this materialimpairment of health.Analyses of the toxicologic data for the substances in this group of chemicalsand OSHA's findings in each case are presented below.<ITAG tagnum="71">ACETALDEHYDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-07-0; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CHO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1001</ITAG>OSHA's previous PEL for acetaldehyde was 200 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. In itsNPRM, OSHA proposed revising its limit for acetaldehyde to 100 ppm as an8-hour TWA and supplementing this with a STEL of 150 ppm; these are thelimits currently recommended by the ACGIH. OSHA is establishing permissibleexposure limits of 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 150 ppm as a 15-minuteSTEL in the final rule. Acetaldehye is a colorless liquid with a pungent,fruity odor.The 200-ppm 1968 TLV established by the ACGIH for acetaldehyde was basedon a sensory irritation study conducted by Silverman, Schulte, and First(1946/Ex. 1-142) that showed that unacclimatized individuals experiencedeye irritation at 50 ppm, but that a level of 200 ppm was tolerable foran 8-hour day. Reexamination of the data reported by Silverman, Schulte,and First (1946/Ex. 1-142) reveals that, at 200 ppm of acetaldehyde, allexposed persons experienced inflammation of the conjuctivae of the eyes,which manifested as redness. OSHA therefore concluded that its previousPEL of 200 ppm placed exposed employees at risk of conjunctivitis and otherirritation and that a reduction to 100 ppm was necessary to reduce thisrisk. OSHA also proposed a STEL of 150 ppm to supplement the 8-hour limitbecause, without a STEL, workers could be exposed to levels many timesthose that have been shown to cause corneal injury, sensitization, andrespiratory tract irritation. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B; Tr. pp. 3-97to 3-98) indicated that acetaldehyde might be a candidate for an individual6(b) rulemaking. As pointed out by the Workers Institute for Safety andHealth (WISH) (Tr. 7-117, Ex. 116, p. 8), IARC has classified acetaldehydeas a possible human carcinogen based on animal data. There is also evidencethat acetaldehyde is teratogenic and fetotoxic in animals (Ex. 116). TheAgency will continue to monitor the scientific evidence for this substanceto examine whether a further reduction in the PEL is warranted.OSHA concludes that employees are placed at significant risk of conjunctivitisand irritation at the current 8-hour TWA limit of 200 ppm. The Agency hasdetermined that conjunctivitis and sensory irritation represent materialimpairments of health or functional capacity. Therefore, OSHA is revisingthe limit for acetaldehyde to 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 150 ppm as a15-minute STEL to substantially reduce this risk.<ITAG tagnum="71">ACETIC ACID</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 64-19-7; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>COOH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1002</ITAG>The former OSHA PEL for acetic acid was a 10-ppm 8-hour TWA. OSHA proposedto retain the TWA limit and to supplement it with a 15-ppm STEL, Basedon the acute irritant properties of acetic acid. These limits are consistentwith the ACGIH recommended TLVs (1986/Ex. 1-3). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) concurred with these proposed limits. However, OSHA's review of theevidence for acetic acid has demonstrated that there is no basis at thistime for a STEL, and the final rule thus retains the 8-hour TWA PEL. Aceticacid is a clear, colorless, flammable liquid with a pungent odor.Sterner (1949/Ex. 1-1207) reported that exposures to concentrations ofacetic acid ranging from 800 to 1200 ppm cannot be tolerated by humansfor longer than three minutes. The AIHA (Ex. 8-16) stated that unacclimatizedworkers experience eye and nasal irritation at acetic acid levels in excessof 26 ppm, and that exposure to 50 ppm is intolerably irritating. The ACGIHalso reported that acclimatized workers are sometimes able to tolerateexposure to concentrations as high as 30 ppm. Guinea pigs exhibited minorchanges in respiration after exposure to 5 ppm; exposure to 100 ppm produceda significant increase in pulmonary flow resistance and a decrease in breathingrate and minute volume, which suggests that bronchial constriction is theprimary irritant action of acetic acid (Amdur 1961/Ex. 1-601).The 10-ppm TWA was established on the basis of studies indicating thatindustrial exposure to acetic acid at 10 ppm was nonirritating (Sterner1943/Ex. 1-806). However, conjunctival irritation has been reported inhumans exposed below 10 ppm (duration not specified) (Baldi 1953/Ex. 1-602),and workers exposed to concentrations of 60 ppm during the workshift, plusone hour daily at 100 to 260 ppm, for 7 to 12 years developed respiratoryirritation, conjunctivitis, bronchitis (which was asthma-like in some workers),pharyngitis, erosion of exposed teeth, and gastritis (Parmeggiani and Sassi(1954/Ex. 1-753). Vigliani and Zurlo (1955/Ex. 1-164) observed respiratory,gastrointestinal, and skin irritation in the same group of workers.In a prehearing comment, Eastman Kodak (Ex. 3-661) argued that there wasno toxicologic basis for a 15-ppm STEL, citing Vigliani and Zurlo (1955/Ex.1-164), who reported that exposure to 20 to 30 ppm is without danger. Inaddition, Kodak stated that irritation has only been observed ``with prolongedand repeated exposures'' above the 10-ppm TWA PEL. Eastman Kodak concludedthat ``[no] significant irritation or other ill effects have been reportedby employees that periodically are exposed to levels of acetic acid inexcess of the proposed 15-ppm STEL'' (Ex. 3-661, p. 4).OSHA has carefully reviewed the toxicologic evidence in the record andhas determined that the evidence supporting a STEL for acetic acid is equivocal.Because information on exposure durations is lacking in the studies citedabove (Baldi 1953/Ex. 1-602; Parmeggiani and Sassi 1954/Ex. 1-753), itis not known whether the conjunctival irritation found among exposed workerswas due to short-term or prolonged exposure to acetic acid. Eastman Kodak(Ex. 3-661) has maintained that prolonged exposure to acetic acid at levelsabove the 10 ppm TWA PEL is necessary to cause irritant responses amongexposed workers. Therefore, in the final rule, OSHA is retaining its 10ppm TWA PEL for acetic acid, but is not supplementing this limit with aSTEL. <ITAG tagnum="71">ACETONE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 67-64-1: Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>COCH<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1004</ITAG>OSHA's previous Z-table limit for acetone was 1000 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.In the NPRM, the Agency proposed to lower this limit to 250 ppm as an 8-hourTWA. This proposed limit was derived from the NIOSH-recommended limit,which was based on a number of industrial and human volunteer studies reportingirritant and central nervous system effects resulting from exposure toacetone concentrations at levels below 1000 ppm; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) and the AFL-CIO (Ex. 194) concurred with the proposed limit. The ACGIHTLVs for acetone are 750 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 1000 ppm as a 15-minuteSTEL. OSHA has carefully reviewed the scientific evidence and commentsin the record and has determined that it is appropriate to revise the acetonePEL in the final rule to 750 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and to add a short-termlimit of 1000 ppm. Acetone is a colorless, highly volatile, flammable liquidwith an aromatic odor. OSHA's proposed 250-ppm TWA limit for acetone was largely based on controlledhuman studies conducted by Nelson, Enge, Ross et al. (1943/Ex. 1-66) andMatsushita, Yoshimune, Inoue et al. (1969/Ex. 1-191), as well as studiesin workers conducted by Vigiliani and Zurlo (1955/Ex. 1-164) and Parmeggianiand Sassi (1954/Ex. 1-753). OSHA's reliance on these studies to establisha revised limit for acetone was criticized by Dr. William C. Thomas, Managerof Toxicology for the Hoechst Celanese Corporation, who testified on behalfof the Ketones Program Panel of the Chemical Manufacturers Association(CMA) (Ex. 8-54; Tr. 8/4/88, pp. 6-114 to 6-127; Exs. 149A, 149C). TheNational Marine Manufacturers Association (Ex. 181) agreed with Dr. Thomas'remarks. Summaries of each of these studies and of OSHA's response to Dr.Thomas' remarks follow. In a controlled-exposure experiment, Nelson, Enge, Ross et al. (1943/Ex.1-66) exposed an average of 10 human subjects (both male and female) toa variety of solvents, including acetone, for three to five minutes. Subjectswere asked to judge the level of sensory irritation as absent, slightlyirritating, or very irritating. Tests were conducted in a 1200-cubic-footgas cabinet equipped with an anemostat to distribute the air uniformly.Acetone was reported to produce slight irritation on exposure to 300 ppm,but a concentration of 500 ppm produced a degree of eye, nose, and throatirrigation that was still described by a majority of the subjects as ``tolerable.''Dr. Thomas expressed five criticisms of the Nelson, Enge, Ross et al. (1943/Ex.1-66) study. These were: (1) The short duration of exposure used; (2) thestudy's failure to account for adaptation because ``naive'' subjects whohad not had previous acetone exposure were used; (3) the authors' relianceon subjective responses rather than on objective medical examination; (4)the use of nominal (calculated) exposures rather than measured exposures;and (5) the introduction of potential bias because students who were involvedin the experiment were used as test subjects (Tr. 8/4/88, pp. 6-114 to6-117; Exs. 149A, 149C). NIOSH addressed some of these issues in its criteria document for ketones(NIOSH 1978f, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 6). In its analysis ofthe Nelson, Enge, Ross et al. (1943/Ex. 1-66) study, NIOSH (1978f) concluded:<ITAG tagnum="21">The concentrations of ketones in the exposure chamber were calculated(nominal) rather than measured analytically, so the true concentrationmay have been lower than reported  * * *. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">[T]he use of experimenters as subjects was a possible source of bias,and the exposure periods of 3-5 minutes were not long enough to show ifadaptation would occur * * *.

(1943/Ex. 1-66) study was useful in identifyingketone concentrations that are irritating, and it relied on this study,at least in part, when recommending a 250-ppm TWA limit for acetone (NIOSH1978f, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 6). The second paper discussed by Dr. Thomas is the report by Matsushita, Yoshimune,Inoue et al. (1969/Ex. 1-191). In this study, the authors exposed 25 healthymale subjects to 0, 100, 250, 500, or 1000 ppm acetone. Subjects were exposedfor three hours in the morning and three hours in the afternoon, with a45-minute period between exposures. Irritant responses were scored on ascale from 0 to 12, with a score of 12 representing severe irritation.Most of the subjects exposed to 500 or 1000 ppm acetone reported irritation(scored between 4 and 5 in severity) during the first 90 minutes of exposurein the morning and the first 60 minutes of exposure in the afternoon. Subjectsceased to report irritation at the 90-minute mark during the afternoonexposure. A lesser degree of irritation was reported to occur among subjectsexposed to 100 or 250 ppm acetone; however, this irritation subsided afterthe first 90 minutes of exposure in each of the two exposure periods. Subjectsexposed to 250 ppm or higher reported feeling general weakness and a senseof tension even as long as 24 hours after exposure. Blood and urine samplestaken during and after exposure showed increasing blood and urinary acetonelevels among subjects exposed to 250 ppm or higher. Following the exposureperiod, these levels fell to normal values within about 25 to 35 hoursafter exposure was terminated. The authors also reported an increased leukocytecount in subjects exposed to 500 or 1000 ppm acetone; the increased whitecell count persisted for about 24 hours after the cessation of exposure.The authors attributed this increased leukocyte count to acetone's irritantproperties (Matsushita, Yoshimune, Inoue et al. 1969/Ex. 1-191).Dr. Thomas criticized this study because it did not describe the methodsused by its authors for measuring acetone exposures, and the blood acetonelevels reported by Matsushita and colleagues (1969/Ex. 1-191) were about2.5 times higher than those reported after similar exposures conductedby DiVincenzo, Yanno, and Astill (1973, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 6). After a two-hour exposure to 500 ppm acetone, Matsushita, Yoshimune,Inoue et al. (1969/Ex. 1-191) found a blood acetone level of 25 mg/L, comparedto a level of 10 mg/L reported by DiVincenzo, Yanno, and Astill (1973,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 6). Dr. Thomas suggested that the actualexposure levels employed by Matsushita and associates (1969/Ex. 1-191)may actually have been substantially higher than reported by these authors(Tr. 8/4/88, pp. 6-118 to 6-119; Exs. 149A, C). OSHA has reviewed the report by DiVincenzo, Yanno, and Astill (1973, ascited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 6) and finds that the blood acetone resultsreported in this paper cannot be directly compared, as Dr. Thomas has done,with those reported by Matsushita, Yoshimune, Inoue et al. (1969/Ex. 1-191),for a number of reasons. First, the subjects studied by DiVincenzo, Yanno,and Astill fasted for eight hours prior to exposure; it is not clear thatthe subjects studied by Matsushita, Yoshimune, Inoue et al. fasted beforethey were exposed. Second, the blood acetone values reported by DiVincenzo,Yanno, and Astill were corrected for endogenous acetone (i.e., acetonelevels that existed prior to exposure). The authors reported that endogenousacetone levels ranged from 0 to 10 mg/L of blood, or about as high as wouldoccur after a two-hour exposure to 500 ppm of acetone. Whether Matsushita,Yoshimune, Inoue et al. corrected for endogenous blood acetone levels isuncertain; if they did not, their reported blood acetone levels may beas much as two times overstated. The third consideration is that the studiesused different methods to measure blood acetone levels. Matsushita, Yoshimune,Inoue, et al. used a colorimetric method, while DiVincenzo, Yanno, andAstill used a gas chromatographic approach. The use of different analyticalmethods by the two investigative groups complicates any comparison of theirblood acetone results. Thus, OSHA does not agree that the results by DiVincenzo,Yanno, and Astill (1973, as cited by ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 6) demonstratethat the exposure levels used by Matsushita, Yoshimune, Inoue et al. (1969/Ex.1-191) are necessarily understated.In addition to the two controlled-exposure studies discussed above, twoindustry studies were relied on by OSHA to support the reduction in theacetone PEL. One report by Parmeggiani and Sassi (1954/Ex. 1-759) indicatedthat six employees exposed to 307 to 918 ppm acetone in a rayon acetateplant experienced eye and throat irritation, dizziness, and inebriation.Five of the employees showed objective signs of pharyngeal irritation,four had lung irritation, and three had conjunctivitis. Although the authorsattributed the observed CNS effects to excessive concomitant exposure tocarbon disulfide, the irritant effects are more likely to have been theresult of exposure to acetone, because carbon disulfide is not a primaryirritant by vapor inhalation (<T3>Chemical Hazards of the Workplace,</T3> 2nd ed., Proctor, Hughes, andFischman 1988, pp. 120-121). The other report, by Vigliani and Zurlo (1955/Ex.1-164), found that acetone production workers exposed to 700 ppm acetonefor three hours daily for 7 to 15 years experienced inflammation of therespiratory tract, stomach, and duodenum; giddiness; and loss of strength.Dr. Thomas (Exs. 8-54, 149A, 149C; Tr. 8/4/88, pp. 6-114 to 6-127) criticizedthese two studies on the basis that the urinary acetone levels reportedby Parmeggiani and Sassi (1954/Ex. 1-759) and by Vigliani and Zurlo (1955/Ex.1-164) indicated that airborne exposures were much higher than the reportedvalues. He stated that, based on these values, the employees observed inboth of these studies were likely to have been exposed to acetone levelsapproximating 5000 ppm. OSHA is not convinced that the exposure levelsreported in these two studies are understated. The studies by Matsushita,Yoshimune, Inoue et al. (1969/Ex. 1-191) and DiVincenzo, Yanno, and Astill(1973, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 6) clearly demonstrate that bloodand urinary acetone levels can increase with continued, daily exposure.Furthermore, in its criteria document, NIOSH (1978f, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 6) cites a number of studies that demonstrate that skinabsorption of acetone can result in elevated blood and urinary acetonelevels. OSHA believes that the high urinary acetone levels reported inthe workers studied by Parmeggiani and Sassi (1954/Ex. 1-759) and by Virgilianiand Zurlo (1955/Ex. 1-164) were most likely the result of an accumulatedbody burden of acetone brought about by long-term exposure and dermal absorption.Given these considerations, it does not appear appropriate to approximateairborne exposure levels on the basis of the urinary acetone levels reportedin these two studies. To summarize, OSHA finds that the studies discussed above show that acetoneis capable of producing sensory irritation at concentrations below 1000ppm and that long-term exposure to acetone at levels below 1000 ppm cancause CNS disturbances. In addition, the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p.6) reportsthat chronic exposure to acetone causes respiratory irritation and headaches.Despite the methodological shortcomings of all of these studies, OSHA isimpressed with the consistency of their findings. Both the Nelson, Enge,Ross et al. (1943/Ex. 1-66) and the Matsushita, Yoshimune, Inoue et al.(1969/Ex. 1-91) studies demonstrate that exposure to concentrations ofacetone below 1000 ppm are associated with eye, nose, and throat irritation.Both industry studies (Parmeggiani and Sassi 1954/Ex. 1-759; Vigliani andZurlo 1955/Ex. 1-164) report similar signs and symptoms of irritation andCNS disturbances in workers exposed to concentrations of acetone between700 and 1000 ppm. OSHA is not persuaded by Dr. Thomas' arguments that exposurelevels are understated in these reports; OSHA believes that the quantitativerelationship between long-term exposure to acetone and urinary acetonelevels is not sufficiently established to draw this conclusion. Therefore,OSHA concludes that the findings of these four studies are consistent indemonstrating the acute and long-term effects of acetone exposure at levelsbelow 1000 ppm.The Ketones Panel of the CMA (Tr. 8/4/88, pp. 6-100 to 6-113; Exs. 149A,149B, and 179) also presented testimony by Dr. Robert Raleigh, AdjunctProfessor of Medicine at the University of Rochester School of Medicine.Dr. Raleigh testified on a study he conducted among filter press operatorswho were exposed exclusively to acetone (Raleigh and McGee 1972, as citedin Ex. 8-54). In this study, 13 workers were asked about symptoms and weremedically examined over a one-week period. Using grab bags, acetone sampleswere taken at random periods during each workshift. Subjective symptomswere recorded with each grab sample. Samples were analyzed by gas chromatography.Over the period studied, TWA exposures to acetone varied from 950 to 1060ppm. Of the 13 workers studied, nine (69 percent) reported eye irritation,five (38 percent) reported nasal irritation, and five (38 percent) reportedthroat irritation. Three (23 percent) employees reported experiencing lightheadedness.Some employees reported these symptoms more than once during the studyperiod. There were four cases of eye irritation following short-term exposuresto acetone concentrations below 1000 ppm. Eye irritation that was reportedto be ``strong'' occurred following short-term exposures to 1200 ppm. Physicalexamination revealed a few instances of redness of the nasal mucosa andslight infection of the mucosa of the nose and throat.In his written testimony regarding this study, Dr. Raleigh concluded:<ITAG tagnum="21">Considering the number of samples taken, the variability of humanresponse, the slight to mild nature of the response, and the lack of <T3>objective</T3> evidence of eye irritation as noted by the examiningphysician, I do not believe * * * [instances of irritation occurring below1000 ppm] indicate the need for a safe level being set below 1000 partsper million (Ex.  8-54, p. 9).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Dr. Raleigh also testified that the occurrence of transient dizzinesswas no cause for concern:<ITAG tagnum="21">[T]his symptom is usually very transient and in my experience I havenever noted any adverse consequences from an occasional person * * * whocomplains of dizziness (Tr. 8/4/88, p. 6-103).</ITAG>OSHA does not agree with Dr. Raleigh's interpretation of his study or withhis view that dizziness, irritation and mild infections of the mucous membranesof the respiratory tract do not constitute material impairments of health.After reviewing the Raleigh and McGee report (1972, as cited in Ex. 8-54),OSHA notes that more than half the workers studied experienced sensoryreactions from exposure to acetone at TWA levels equal to the former 1000-ppmOSHA limit. Furthermore, some of these reactions were characterized as``strong.'' OSHA believes that this study further demonstrates that theAgency's former 1000-ppm 8-hour TWA limit is insufficiently protectiveand does not prevent workers from experiencing these sensory effects. Inaddition, in contrast to Dr. Raleigh, OSHA characterizes transient dizzinessin and of itself as an ``adverse consequence.'' Dizziness connotes an effecton the central nervous system; in addition, dizziness is a serious safetyhazard in the workplace. For the reasons stated earlier in this section,OSHA finds that such effects constitute material impairments of health.Thus, OSHA finds that the Raleigh and McGee study (1972, as cited in Ex.8-54) is a recent, well-conducted study that provides additional supportfor the need to lower the former 1000-ppm TWA limit for acetone. Furthermore,OSHA finds the evidence that adverse effects can result from short-termexposures to levels of acetone at or near 750 ppm convincing; two controlledhuman studies (Nelson, Enge, Ross et al. 1943/Ex. 1-66; Matsushita, Yoshimune,Inoue et al. 1969/Ex. 1-191) reported sensory irritant effects upon short-termexposure to such levels of acetone, and two industry studies (Parmeggianiand Sassi 1954/Ex. 1-759; Vigliani and Zurlo 1955/Ex. 1-164) reported irritationand CNS effects among employees exposed to acetone levels ranging from307 to 918 ppm in one instance and about 700 ppm in the other. In addition,two studies (Matsushita, Yoshimune, Inoue et al. 1969/Ex. 1-191; DiVincenzo,Yanno, and Astill 1973, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 6) suggest thatchronic exposure to acetone on a daily basis leads to the bioaccumulationof acetone.In light of the studies discussed above, OSHA concludes that it is necessaryto reduce the limit for acetone to 750 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 1000 ppmas a STEL to protect workers from the acute and chronic effects of acetoneexposure. OSHA finds that the chemically induced sensory irritation associatedwith acute exposures to acetone can occur at levels only slightly abovethe 750-ppm level being established as an 8-hour TWA. In the absence ofa STEL, the 750-ppm limit would permit excursions to levels as high as12,000 ppm for brief periods. Such levels ``depress the central nervoussystem, causing dizziness, weakness, and loss of consciousness'' (Proctor,Hughes, and Fischman 1988, p. 49). An 8-hour TWA of 750 ppm is necessaryto protect workers against the bioaccumulation of acetone, chronic irritationof the respiratory tract, and headaches associated with long-term acetoneexposures. OSHA considers both the short-term sensory irritation associatedwith brief exposures to acetone and the increased blood and urinary accumulationand chronic respiratory irritation characteristic of long-term acetoneexposures to be material impairments of health. Accordingly, OSHA is establishingin the final rule an 8-hour TWA PEL of 750 ppm and a STEL of 1000 ppm foracetone.<ITAG tagnum="71">ACROLEIN</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-02-8; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>=CHCHO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1007</ITAG>OSHA formerly had an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.1 ppm (0.25 mg/m3) for acrolein.OSHA proposed the addition of a 0.3-ppm STEL to this TWA limit, and thefinal rule adopts this short-term limit. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurredwith these proposed limits. These limits for acrolein are the same as thoserecommended by the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3). Acrolein is a colorless or yellowishflammable liquid with a disagreeable, choking odor.In early inhalation studies of cats (Iwanoff 1911, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 11), exposure to 10 ppm acrolein for 3.5 hours was found to haveonly transient effects, including salivation, lacrimation, respiratoryirritation, and mild narcosis. However, later studies reported that anexposure to 1 ppm of acrolein produced marked nose and eye irritation infive minutes or less (Cook 1945/Ex. 1-726). Over longer periods, studieshave demonstrated fatalities in one of six rats exposed for four hoursto airborne concentrations of acrolein at 8 ppm; at 16 ppm, the mortalitywas 100 percent (Smyth 1956/Ex. 1-759). Irritation of the upper respiratorytract is the primary symptom of acrolein inhalation, but lung edema canoccur after exposure to high concentrations (Henderson and Haggard 1943a/Ex.1-881). In addition, skin contact with acrolein causes skin burns and severeinjury to the cornea.No comments (other than NIOSH's) were received on OSHA's proposed 8-hourtime-weighted-average limit or its 15-minute short-term limit of 0.3 ppm.OSHA concludes that, in the absence of a STEL, the current 0.1-ppm TWAlimit would not protect employees from short-term exposures to airborneconcentrations in excess of 1 ppm, the level found by Cook (1945/Ex. 1-726)to cause severe eye and nose irritation. OSHA considers these adverse effectsto represent material impairments of health or functional capacity. Therefore,OSHA finds that the 0.3-ppm STEL is necessary to protect employees fromthe significant risk associated with mucous membrane irritation, and theAgency is revising the exposure limit for acrolein to 0.1 ppm as an 8-hourTWA and 0.3 ppm as a 15-minute STEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">ALLYL ALCOHOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-18-6; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>=CHCH<T2>2</T2>OH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1010</ITAG>OSHA previously had a PEL of 2 ppm TWA for allyl alcohol, with a skin notation.OSHA proposed to supplement this TWA limit with a STEL of 4 ppm and toretain the existing skin notation. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurredwith this proposal. The final rule establishes a 2-ppm TWA limit, a 4-ppmSTEL, and a skin notation for allyl alcohol, which is consistent with theACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) recommendation. Allyl alcohol is a colorless liquidwith a pungent, mustard-like odor.The most important adverse effects of occupational exposures to allyl alcoholare upper-respiratory-tract irritation and burns of the eyes. In a controlledhuman sensory response study (Dunlap, Kodama, Wellington et al. 1958/Ex.1-630), a five-minute exposure to 25 ppm resulted in severe eye irritation.Milder irritation has been reported to occur at 5 ppm (McCord 1932, ascited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 18). Necrosis of the cornea and temporaryblindness occurred in one individual exposed to allyl alchol at a levelirritating to the eyes and nose (Smyth 1956/Ex. 1-759). Skin absorptionmay lead to serious systemic injury (visceral congestion, periportal congestionof the liver, hematuria, and nephritis); in addition, when evaporationfrom the skin is prevented or reduced, skin contact causes burns (ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 18).Exposure to airborne concentrations of allyl alcohol causes a series ofcharacteristic effects, including lacrimation, photophobia, blurred vision,and retrobulbar pain (Dunlap, Kodama, Wellington et al. 1958/Ex. 1-630).Exposed individuals do not develop a tolerance for this substance, andthey also do not become sensitized (Kodama and Hine 1958/Ex. 1-1088).The New Jersey Department of Public Health (Ex. 144, 144A) urged OSHA toset its limits for allyl alcohol on the basis of EPA's IRIS data. The useof such an approach is discussed in Section VI.A of the preamble.In a prehearing comment, Dr. Lawrence Hecker of Abbott Laboratories (Ex.3-678) stated that a STEL did not appear to be warranted for allyl alcohol,based on his review of the literature. However, Dr. Hecker did not specificallydiscuss the evidence or rationale underlying this contention. In reviewingthe evidence for allyl alcohol, OSHA notes that severe eye irritation hasbeen reported to occur in human subjects exposed to 25 ppm for as shortan interval as five minutes (Dunlap, Kodama, Wellington et al. 1958/Ex.1-630); such an exposure would be permitted under the current limit of2 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. OSHA also notes that short-term exposure to allylalcohol produces characteristic effects more severe than those caused byother sensory irritants; these effects include photophobia and blurredvision. OSHA considers the effects of sensory irritation and disturbedvision to constitute material impairments of health or functional capacity.Sax and Lewis (1989) report that the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 53 mg/kg, indicating that allyl alcohol readilypermeates the skin and causes systemic toxicity.OSHA concludes that the scientific evidence clearly shows a significanthealth risk associated with short-term exposure to the levels of allylalcohol that would be permitted under the former standard; accordingly,the Agency is establishing a 4-ppm 15-minute STEL to supplement its 8-hourTWA limit of 2 ppm. The final rule retains the skin notation for this substanceto protect workers from dermal absorption.<ITAG tagnum="71">ALLYL GLYCIDYL ETHER</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 106-92-3; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>10</T2>O<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1012</ITAG>OSHA's former PEL for allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) was 10 ppm (45 mg/m3)as a ceiling. OSHA proposed to revise this limit to a TWA of 5 ppm, andto add a 15-minute STEL of 10 ppm and a skin notation, consistent withthe recommended limits of the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) concurred with this proposal. In the final rule, OSHA is establishingthe air contaminant limits as proposed, but is not establishing a skinnotation for this substance (see Section VI.C.18 for a discussion of theAgency's policy on skin notations). Allyl glycidyl ether is a colorlessliquid of characteristic, but not unpleasant, odor.In limited human exposure studies, AGE has been demonstrated to cause dermatitisand eye irritation; the substance produces moderate primary skin irritationand severe eye irritation in animals (Hine, Kodama, Wellington et al. 1956/Ex.1-331). At 260 ppm, animals experienced irritation of the eyes and respiratorydistress; at higher levels (e.g., 400, 600, and 900 ppm), corneal opacitiesand severe respiratory difficulties occurred (Hine, Kodama, Wellingtonet al. 1956/Ex. 1-331). The percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> for rabbits is 2.55 g/kg. Intragastric administration of AGEin mice, rats, and rabbits has also been demonstrated to cause depressionof the central nervous system (Hine, Kodama, Wellington et al. 1956/Ex.1-331).In humans, skin sensitization occurs readily (Hine and Rowe 1963a, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 20). In addition to primary irritation and sensitization,the potential exists for cross-sensitization with other epoxy agents (ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 20).Sax and Lewis (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>7th ed., 1989) reportthe dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits to be 2.25 g/kg; there is no other evidence of systemicpoisoning occurring from skin absorption in humans or other animal species.Therefore, in accordance with the general policy described in Section VI.C.18of this preamble, OSHA is not establishing a skin notation for AGE. Otherthan those submitted by NIOSH, OSHA received no comments on its proposedrevision of the exposure limit for AGE.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing PELs of 5 ppm (8-hour TWA) and10 ppm (15-minute STEL) for allyl glycidyl ether. OSHA concludes that thesecombined limits will reduce the significant risks of sensitization andprimary irritation to which employees could otherwise be exposed. OSHAconsiders these adverse effects material impairments of health and functionalcapacity.<ITAG tagnum="71">ALLYL PROPYL DISULFIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 2179-59-1; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>=CHCH<T2>2</T2>S<T2>2</T2>C<T2>3</T2>H<T2>7</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1013</ITAG>The previous OSHA PEL for allyl propyl disulfide was 2 ppm (12 mg/m3) asan 8-hour TWA. OSHA proposed to supplement this limit with a 3-ppm (18-mg/m3)15-minute STEL, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal.The final rule establishes a 2-ppm TWA limit and 3-ppm STEL for this substance;these limits are the same as those recommended by the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3).Allyl propyl disulfide is a liquid with a pungent, irritating odor.Nearly all occupational exposures to allyl propyl disulfide, the primaryvolatile constituent of onion oil, occur in the processing of onions andonion products. Allyl propyl disulfide's irritative effects on the humaneye, nose, and upper respiratory tract are well recognized. The most severeirritation effects have occurred when workers were exposed to allyl propyldisulfide in the vicinity of onion slicing machines, where average concentrationsof 3.4 ppm have been measured (Feiner, Burke, and Baliff 1946/Ex. 1-604).No rulemaking participants other than NIOSH commented on the addition ofa STEL to the current TWA limit for allyl propyl disulfide. OSHA concludesthat, in the absence of a STEL, the 2-ppm TWA limit would not prevent employeesfrom being exposed to short-term concentrations of sufficient magnitudeto cause acute irritant effects. The Agency considers this effect to constitutematerial impairment of health and functional capacity. Accordingly, OSHAfinds that a limit on short-term exposure is necessary to protect workersfrom significant acute irritation and is supplementing its current 2-ppmTWA limit with a 3-ppm 15-minute STEL in the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="71">AMMONIA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7664-41-7; Chemical Formula: NH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1021</ITAG>OSHA's former exposure limit for ammonia was 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. OSHAproposed to revise this limit to 25 ppm TWA and to add a 35-ppm 15-minuteSTEL, based on the limits established by the ACGIH. NIOSH indicated itsagreement with these proposed limits (Ex. 8-47, Table N1). However, inthe final rule, the Agency has determined that it is not appropriate toestablish a 25-ppm TWA limit for ammonia; the final rule does revise OSHA'sexposure limit to 35 ppm as a 15-minute STEL. Ammonia is principally usedas a feedstock in the manufacture of fertilizers and other chemical substancesand is also used as a refrigerant.Ammonia is a primary eye and upper respiratory tract irritant. An unpublishedstudy conducted by the Detroit Department of Health and cited by the ACGIH(1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 27) reports that ammonia concentrations in the rangeof 20 to 25 ppm elicited complaints of discomfort from workers engagedin blueprinting and copying operations. In addition, a study of pigs conductedby Stombaugh et al. (1969) appeared to demonstrate that exposure to ammoniacauses systemic effects. Thus the ACGIH established both a full-shift TWAof 25 ppm to protect against chronic effects and a 35-ppm STEL to protectagainst ammonia's irritant effects.OSHA also considered NIOSH's recommended 5-minute ceiling limit for ammoniaof 50 ppm. When making this recommendation, NIOSH relied on several reportsthat ammonia concentrations as low as 50 ppm are moderately irritating(Vigliani and Zurlo 1955/Ex. 1-164; Mangold 1971; Industrial Bio-test Laboratories1873, all as cited in NIOSH 1974a/Ex. 1-238; MacEwen, Theodore, and Vernot1970/Ex.1-827; Pagnotto 1973, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 27). NIOSHconcluded that the ``irritating or annoying effects * * * [of exposureto ammonia are] more dependent upon concentration than length of exposure,''and that ``a standard expressed as a time-weighted average is inappropriatesince it would permit fluctuations to concentrations considerably higherthan 50 ppm'' (NIOSH 1974a/Ex. 1-238, p. 69). In the proposal, OSHA preliminarilyconcluded that NIOSH's recommended 50-ppm ceiling limit was above the effectlevel reported in the Detroit Department of Health studies (1965-1970,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 27) for sensory irritation.Several rulemaking participants objected to a reduction in the current50-ppm TWA limit (Exs. 3-375, 3-582, 3-756, 3-869, 3-888, 3-902, 3-939,3-1012, 3-1118, 8-25, 8-29, 8-62, 8-68, 8-123, 8-136, 113, and 122). Atthe rulemaking hearing, Lucas Seeman, Technical Advisor for the Associationof Reproduction Materials Manufacturers (ARMM), testified that there wasno basis for the proposed revision since the effects associated with exposureto 50 ppm of ammonia did not, in his opinion, constitute impairment ofhealth:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Detroit Health Department studies, which make reference to ``workercomplaints'' of ammonia exposures, appear to be based on subjective reactionsof workers and not any manifestation of health impairment or physical evidenceof severe irritation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">None of the reference data added [by the ACGIH] in 1980 * * * madereference to any health impairment at the 25-ppm TWA or 35-ppm STEL levelsof exposure. References added in 1980 did indicate that at 50 ppm workersreported no irritation, or minor to moderate irritation, and that theyquickly became accustomed to the ammonia exposure up to that level (Tr.VII, pp. 222-224).</ITAG>In reviewing the record evidence, OSHA finds that the 50-ppm 5-minute ceilinglimit recommended by NIOSH is not sufficiently protective against ammonia'sirritant effects. The evidence discussed by NIOSH (Ex. 150) and the testimonypresented by Mr. Seeman (Tr. VII, pp. 222-224) show that, at levels below50 ppm, some workers experience eye and upper respiratory tract irritation.This view is supported by Proctor, Hughes, and Fischman (<T3>Chemical Hazards of the Workplace,</T3> 2nd ed., 1988, p. 71), whoreport that even 5-minute exposures to 32 ppm caused nasal dryness in 10percent of exposed volunteers, and that 5-minute exposures to 50 ppm ammoniacaused nasal irritation and dryness in 20 percent of exposed volunteers.Deborah Berkowitz of the AFL-CIO testified that two companies in the meatpacking industry evacuate the work place if airborne concentrations ofammonia reach 25 ppm (Tr. pp. 6-310 to 6-311).OSHA finds that sensory irritation, such as that experienced by volunteersexposed to ammonia (Proctor, Hughes, and Fischman, 1988) constitutes materialimpairment of health. OSHA also finds that the fact that some workers maybe-come acclimatized to ammonia exposures at concentrations as high as50 ppm may account for the belief expressed by Mr. Seeman and others that50 ppm is an acceptable exposure level. However, OSHA does not agree withthis view of acclimatization because the long-term consequences of a continualassault on the sensory nerves are not known. In addition, acclimatizationlessens the ability of workers to discern airborne concentrations of otherhazardous materials.The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) believes that an 8-hour TWA limit is necessaryfor ammonia because a study by Stombaugh, Teague, and Roller (1960/Ex.1-29) reports that pigs exposed continuously to 103 to 145 ppm ammoniareduced their consumption of food and lost weight. The ACGIH interpretsthis study to mean that systemic toxicity occurs as a result of chronicexposure to ammonia. However, OSHA interprets this study differently, believinginstead that it shows a secondary effect of the irritation traditionallyassociated with ammonia exposure. That is, in OSHA's view, these pigs stoppedeating because they were experiencing too much respiratory and eye irritationto be interested in their food.Thus, OSHA does not find it necessary in the final rule to establish an8-hour TWA limit for ammonia to protect against chronic effects. Instead,the Agency concludes that a 15-minute STEL of 35 ppm will protect againstthis substance's irritant effects, which have been demonstrated to occurin workers exposed to ammonia at and below 50 ppm. OSHA concludes thatthe eye and upper respiratory tract irritation associated with ammoniaexposure constitute material impairments of health and pose a significantrisk to exposed workers.<ITAG tagnum="71">AMMONIUM CHLORIDE (FUME)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 12125-02-9 Chemical Formula: NH<T2>4</T2>C1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Ammonium chlorideis a white crystalline solid, somewhat hygroscopic, with a cool, salinetaste.Ammonium chloride fume is an irritant to the skin and respiratory passageswhen inhaled and produces mild systemic toxicity when ingested (Sax 1968a/Ex.1-867). Although exposure-response data are lacking for this substance,the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) judged that these workplace limits would be sufficientto prevent workers from experiencing respiratory irritation.OSHA received no comment on the proposed addition of exposure limits forammonium chloride fume to the Z tables, other than those submitted by NIOSH.OSHA finds that, in the absence of any limit on airborne exposure, employeesare at significant risk of respiratory irritation caused by exposure tohigh concentrations of ammonium chloride fume. OSHA concludes that therespiratory irritation caused by exposure to ammonium chloride fume constitutesa material impairment of health. To substantially reduce this risk, OSHAis establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 mg/m3 and a 15-minute STEL of20 mg/m3 in the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="71">BORATES, TETRA, SODIUM SALTS (ANHYDROUS, PENTAHYDRATE, AND DECAHYDRATE)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1303-96-4 (Decahydrate); Chemical formula: Na<T2>2</T2>B<T2>4</T2>O<T2>7</T2> 10H<T2>2</T2>O</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">1330-43-4 (Anhydrous); Chemical Formula: Na</ITAG><T2>2</T2>B<T2>4</T2>O<T2>7</T2><ITAG tagnum="24">12179-04-3 (Pentahydrate); Chemical Formula: Na</ITAG><T2>2</T2>B<T2>4</T2>O<T2>7</T2> 5H<T2>2</T2>O<ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. Nos. 1036, 1038, and 1037</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no exposure limits for the anhydrous or hydrated formsof sodium tetraborate. Based on the ACGIH-recommended TLVs for these substances,OSHA proposed a 1-mg/m3 8-hour TWA PEL for the anhydrous and pentahydrateforms of sodium tetraborate and a 5-mg/m3 TWA PEL for the decahydrate form.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with these proposed limits. However,during the rulemaking proceeding, OSHA received several comments on theproposed limits and obtained information on a large health survey currentlybeing conducted by the U.S. Borax and Chemical Corporation. Based on thisevidence, the Agency has determined that it is appropriate at this timeto establish a 10-mg/m3 8-hour TWA limit for all forms of the sodium tetraborates.Anhydrous sodium tetraborate is a light gray, orderless solid; the pentahydrateand decahydrate forms are white, orderless, and crystalline.OSHA's proposed limits were based on some early studies cited by the ACGIH(1986/Ex. 1-3) and on observation that the anhydrous and pentahydrate formsof sodium tetraborate present a greater irritant hazard than does the decahydrateform. These early studies reported that exposure to the tetraborates producesirritation of the skin, eyes, and upper respiratory tract and can causeshortness of breath and nosebleeds. These studies were criticized at thehearings by John Middleton, Manager of Product Safety for the U.S. BoraxResearch Corporation, because they did not have sufficient exposure datato define a dose-response relationship (Tr. p. 9-113).During the rulemaking, commenters discussed two NIOSH health hazard evaluations(HHEs) relevant to the borates. The first study (HHE 75-059-496, NIOSH1978o) was conducted at the Kerr-McGee Chemical Corporation plant in Trona,California. NIOSH performed clinical examinations of nine employees exposedto tetraborates and collected total dust samples for each employee. Clinicalexamination revealed symptoms of eye irritation in five employees, noseirritation with bleeding in three workers, throat irritation in three employees,and chapping of the hands in four workers. Four of the nine dust samplesexceeded 10 mg/m3, with the highest being 29.9 mg/m3. In testimony beforethe Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board in California in 1985,Dr. Charles Hine of Kerr-McGee stated that dust exposures at the Californiaplant were probably well above the 10-mg/m3 level because employees commentedthat dust from ``frequent windstorms'' was the main problem at the plant.Dr. Hine also noted that the NIOSH HHE reported that dust levels at theplant were excessive and that the visibility of employees was impaired(Ex. 3-744, Attachment I).The second NIOSH HHE (conducted in 1980) reported on a walk-through surveyof the U.S. Borax and Chemical Corporation's Boron, CA Operation. ThisHHE identified health complaints among employees, and its findings ledto a larger, more comprehensive health survey in 1981 (HETA 80-109), areport of which was subsequently published in a peer-reviewed journal (Garabrant,Bernstein, Peters et al. 1985). Data on employees' respiratory symptomswere obtained by questionnaire, and total dust measurements were collectedfrom historical data obtained between 1977 and 1981. The authors foundno evidence of X-ray abnormalities or declines in pulmonary function amongthe 629 active employees examined. There was a dose-related and statisticallysignificant increase in the frequency of reported symptoms, which includedeye irritation, dry cough, nosebleeds, sore throat, shortness of breath,and chest tightness. Over 10 percent of employees having mean TWA exposuresof 8.6 mg/m3, measured as total tetraborate dust, reported experiencingnosebleeds, dry cough, eye irritation, and dryness of the mouth, nose,or throat. At a mean exposure level of 14.6 mg/m3, between 15 and 30 percentof the employees examined reported these symptoms. The authors concludedthat borax dust appears to act as a simple respiratory irritant and maycause small changes in pulmonary function among smokers who are also heavilyexposed to borate dust.U.S. Borax submitted to the record the written testimony of Dr. David Heilbron,a biostatistician (Ex. 3-744, Attachment 2), and of Dr. Ralph C. Smith,Professor of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health,University of Michigan (Ex. 3-744, Attachment 3), both of whom were ofthe opinion that the Garabrant et al. (1985) study's treatment of exposuredata was biased. For example, Dr. Heilbron objected to the grouping ofemployees into three exposure categories, commenting that such aggregation``can seriously distort a dose-response relationship and particularly,the estimation of an effect threshold * * *'' (Ex. 34-744, Attachment 2,p. 4). Dr. Heilbron also took issue with these authors' use of geometricmeans to describe the tetraborate exposure data; in the opinion of Dr.Heilbron, there was no statistical justification for the use of geometricmeans because of the heterogeneity of jobs within each exposure group.OSHA believes that it is not possible to determine whether arithmetic orgeometric means are appropriate without having access to the raw data.OSHA notes further that Garabrant and his co-authors (1985) both gatheredand analyzed the data and that neither Dr. Heilbron nor Dr. Smith has accessto these data.Dr. Smith (Ex. 3-347, Attachment 3) believes that the exposure data inthe Garabrant et al. (1985) study substantially underreported the actualexposures of the workers comprising the study group. According to Dr. Smith,when the data are reanalyzed using arithmetic means, the observed healtheffects would be associated with exposures to much higher dust levels thanthose presented in the report (Ex. 3-744, Attachment 3, p. 13).  Because the raw exposure data from the study were not available to Dr.Smith, he based his reanalysis of the exposure data on an assumption thatall individuals in a job category had exposures equal to the mean exposurelevel for the job category as a whole. For example, according to Dr. Smith,if ``four laborers in the fusing building had average exposures of 49.2mg/m3 * * * [it was assumed] that all four had the same exposure'' (Ex.3-744, Attachment 3, p. 8). OSHA believes that Dr. Smith's approach providesless information about the actual exposures of the members of the cohortthan does Dr. Garabrant's because Dr. Garabrant took two factors (representativedata by job category as well as subjective self-reporting of exposure levelsby employees) into account, while Dr. Smith only considered a single factor(job category). That is, Dr. Smith assumes that all workers in a job categoryhave the same exposure, while Dr. Garabrant's approach recognizes the impactof such factors as individual differences in work practices, differencesin control effectiveness at different workstations, etc., on the exposuresof individuals in the same job category. OSHA is therefore unpersuadedby Dr. Smith's reanalysis; the Agency finds Dr. Garabrant's analysis convincingand believes that it more accurately reflects the true exposures of membersof this cohort.  Largely because of questions raised concerning the dose-response relationshipfor tetraborates, U.S. Borax has been conducting a large epidemiologicstudy at its facility. This study, described at the informal hearing byMr. Middleton (Tr. pp. 9-114 to 9-115, Ex. 120), will span a three- tofour-year period and will obtain about 400 measurements of workplace tetraboratedust. The test protocols have been reviewed by representatives of OSHA,the U.S. Bureau of Mines, NIOSH, the ACGIH TLV Committee, and the MineSafety and Health Administration. The final report is expected to be releasedin mid-1989. At the hearing, Mr. Middleton stated the position of U.S.Borax:<ITAG tagnum="21">Based on the fact that the present data does not support the establish[ment]of PEL's for these compounds and that U.S. Borax is presently collectingdata that could be meaningful in establishing PEL's, we request that OSHAdelay action on these compounds until these data are available and canbe analyzed by OSHA and MSHA (Tr. pp. 9-115).</ITAG>OSHA commends U.S. Borax for undertaking this effort to study the relationshipbetween exposure to tetraborates and respiratory effects. OSHA believesthat such data are essential to inform employees properly about hazardspresent in their workplaces and to guide employers in the development ofeffective occupational health programs. However, OSHA does not agree thatthe evidence currently available is inadequate to serve as a basis forestablishing a PEL for the tetraborates at the present time. The studyby Garabrant et al. (1985) does demonstrate a dose-response relationshipfor respiratory symptoms and exposure to sodium borates. OSHA finds thatemployees should be protected from experiencing the symptoms that havebeen reported. These symptoms, which have been reported in the more recentGarabrant et al. (1985) and NIOSH (1978o; 1980b) studies, as well as inthe older literature, include nosebleeds, upper respiratory tract irritation,dermatitis, and dyspnea. OSHA believes that this evidence clearly indicatesthat the tetraborates act as primary respiratory and skin irritants, andthat a 10-mg/m3 PEL is clearly warranted. In light of the research currentlybeing conducted by U.S. Borax, however, OSHA notes that the Agency willconsider new evidence as it becomes available and will revise its limitsif such action appears to be appropriate.  OSHA agrees with U.S. Borax that, at this time, there are insufficientdata upon which to establish different PELs for the different hydratedforms of tetraborate. OSHA believes that current sampling and analyticalprocedures cannot distinguish among the various hydrated forms of tetraborate(Ex. 3-744, Attachment 3, pp. 4-5) and therefore that separate standardsof 5 mg/m3 and 1 mg/m3 are not feasible at this time.  OSHA concludes that an 8-hour TWA of 10 mg/m3 is appropriate for the tetraborates,and the final rule establishes this limit. OSHA finds that, in the absenceof any limit on exposure, employees are at significant risk of experiencingacute eye, skin, and respiratory irritation effects, and that a 10-mg/m3PEL will substantially reduce these risks. The Agency considers the eye,skin, and upper respiratory tract irritation caused by exposure to allforms of sodium tetraborates to be material impairments of health.  <ITAG tagnum="71">BROMINE  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7726-95-6; Chemical Formula: Br<T2>2</T2>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1042</ITAG>OSHA's previous exposure limit for bromine was 0.1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.OSHA proposed to supplement this TWA limit with a STEL of 0.3 ppm, thesame limit recommended by the ACGIH, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurredwith this proposal. In the final rule, the Agency is establishing a 0.1-ppmTWA limit and a 0.3-ppm STEL for bromine. Bromine is a dark, reddish-brown,noncombustible, diatomic liquid that has irritating vapors.  Early studies of bromine exposure indicated that workers exposed to 0.75ppm for 6 hours exhibited no symptoms (Flury and Zernik 1931a, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 65). Later studies reported physiological responsesto different concentrations of bromine and used these findings to makethe following recommendations: The maximum allowable concentration forprolonged exposures should be 0.1 to 0.15 ppm, and the maximum allowableconcentration for short-term exposures (i.e., 30 minutes to one hour) shouldbe 4 ppm (Henderson and Haggard 1943b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 65). These investigators found levels of 40 to 60 ppm dangerous forshort-term exposures, and a level of 1000 ppm proved rapidly fatal evenduring short exposures. These authors reported that the effects of exposureto bromine include respiratory irritation and lung edema. Elkins (1959a/Ex.1106) reported that workers exposed to 1 ppm in a plant handling liquidbromine found this level excessively irritating.OSHA received no comments on its proposed STEL for bromine, other thanthe NIOSH concurrence statement. The Agency finds that both the TWA andthe short-term limits are necessary to substantially reduce the risk ofrespiratory irritation and lung damage that could occur following short-termexposures to concentrations of bromine that would be permitted by the 8-hourTWA limit alone. OSHA considers the effects related to bromine exposurematerial impairments of health. Therefore, OSHA is revising the limit forbromine to 0.1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 0.3 ppm as a 15-minute STEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">2-BUTANONE (METHYL ETHYL KETONE)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 78-93-3; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>COCH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1045</ITAG>OSHA's former exposure limit for 2-butanone was 200 ppm TWA. OSHA proposedto supplement this limit with a STEL of 300 ppm, based on the ACGIH (1986/Ex.1-3) recommendation. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal.The final rule establishes a 200-ppm TWA limit and a 300-ppm STEL for 2-butanone.2-Butanone is a colorless, flammable liquid with an objectionable odor.2-Butanone is an ocular and upper respiratory tract irritant. One study(Nelson, Enge, Ross et al. 1943/Ex. 1-66) reported that exposures to 200ppm for 3 to 5 minutes caused mild eye irritation in some subjects andthat others experienced slight nose and throat irritation at concentrationsof 100 ppm. Exposure to 350 ppm caused eye and nasal irritation in a majorityof subjects tested. Studies conducted in the 1940s noted low-grade intoxicationresulting from exposure to 300 to 600 ppm (Smith and Mayers 1944, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 395). Later studies have shown that approximately50 percent of trained panelists experienced eye and nose irritation at200 ppm (as reported in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 395).In the preamble discussion on 2-butanone, OSHA noted that a number of studiesindicate that the proposed limits may not be sufficient to fully protectworkers from the irritant effects of this substance (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3;Nelson, Enge, Ross et al. 1943/Ex. 1-66). The ACGIH also cited a manufacturer'spublication that stated that 200 ppm was the highest concentration judgedby human subjects to be ``satisfactory'' for eight hours. In addition,another study cited by the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) reported that exposureto 200 ppm was associated with a 50-percent response rate for eye and nasalirritation (the degree of irritation was not specified).OSHA specifically requested comment on whether its proposed limits for2-butanone were sufficiently protective. The New Jersey Department of PublicHealth (Exs. 144, 144A) urged OSHA to set its limits for 2-butanone basedon EPA's IRIS data. The use of such an approach is discussed in SectionVI.A of the preamble. The AFL-CIO (Ex. 194) supported the establishmentof a STEL for butanone.OSHA has determined that its previous 8-hour TWA limit of 200 ppm was notsufficient to protect workers from experiencing the significant irritationand narcotic effects that are associated with short-term exposures to highconcentrations of 2-butanone. After reviewing the available reports describinghuman sensory responses to short-term exposures to 2-butanone, the Agencyconcludes that a 300-ppm STEL is also necessary to reduce the significantrisk of sensory irritation; exposure to 350 ppm for three to five minuteswas reported to cause eye, nose, and throat irritation in a majority ofsubjects (Nelson, Enge, Ross et al. 1943/Ex. 1-66). Accordingly, OSHA isestablishing a 200-ppm TWA limit and a 300-ppm 15-minute STEL for 2-butanoneto protect employees from the significant risk of sensory irritation; OSHAconsiders the irritation caused by 2-butanone to be a material impairmentof health or functional capacity.<ITAG tagnum="71">n-BUTYL ACETATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS No. 123-86-4; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>COO(CH<T2>2</T2>)<T2>3</T2>CH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1047</ITAG>The previous OSHA exposure limit for n-butyl acetate was 150 ppm, measuredas an 8-hour TWA. OSHA proposed the adoption of a 15-minute STEL of 200ppm to supplement the TWA limit. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred withthis proposal. The final rule establishes limits of 150 ppm as an 8-hourTWA and 200 ppm as a 15-minute STEL for this substance; these are the samelimits as those recommended by the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3). n-Butyl acetateis a colorless liquid with a fruity odor.n-Butyl acetate is an irritant to the eyes, skin, and respiratory system.In a study involving cats exposed for six hours to 6100 ppm, slight narcoticeffects were noted (Flury and Wirth 1933, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 72). When exposed to 4200 ppm n-butyl acetate for six days at six hoursper day, cats experienced slight irritation of the respiratory passage;at 3100 ppm, changes in blood cell morphology were recorded. At exposuresof 1600 ppm, these cats exhibited slight irritation of the eyes and increasedsalivation (Flury and Wirth 1933, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 72).Air concentrations of 10,000 ppm n-butyl acetate proved fatal to rats aftereight hours; four hours of exposure at the same level produced no deaths(Smyth 1956/Ex. 1-759). A paper by Sayers, Schrenk, and Patty (1936/Ex.1-802) reported that guinea pigs demonstrated eye irritation effects at3300 ppm, became unconscious after nine hours of exposure to 7000 ppm,and died after four hours of exposure to 14,000 ppm.Human volunteers complained that throat irritation, which began at an exposurelevel of 200 ppm n-butyl acetate, worsened and became quite severe at 300ppm (Nelson, Enge, Ross et al. 1943/Ex. 1-66). NIOSH was the only commenterto the record in response to OSHA's proposed STEL for n-butyl acetate.OSHA finds that workers are at significant risk of experiencing severeeye, skin, and respiratory irritation, in addition to narcotic effects,that are associated with short-term exposures to this substance at levelsabove the 8-hour limit. The Agency considers the irritant and narcoticeffects resulting from exposure to n-butyl acetate to be material impairmentsof health and functional capacity. OSHA concludes that a STEL is necessaryto reduce this risk, and the Agency is therefore revising its limit forn-butyl acetate to 150 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 200 ppm as a 15-minuteSTEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">n-BUTYL LACTATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 138-22-7; Chemical Formula: C<T2>7</T2>H<T2>14</T2>O<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1053</ITAG>OSHA previously had no limit for n-butyl lactate but proposed a 5-ppm 8-hourTWA limit, based on the ACGIH recommendation. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1)concurred with the proposed 5-ppm TWA limit, and this limit is establishedin the final rule. Butyl lactate is a colorless liquid ester of lacticacid.In humans, prolonged exposures to n-butyl lactate at approximately 7 ppm,with brief peak excursions to 11 ppm, caused headache, irritation of thepharyngeal and laryngeal mucosa, and coughing in all workers, and occasionalnausea, vomiting, and sleepinessh in some (Zuidema and Pel 1969, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 82). Headache, coughing, and irritation of thepharynx were sometimes related to n-butyl lactate concentrations of 4 ppm;however, no adverse effects were observed at a concentration of 1.4 ppm.Studies employing improved sampling and analytic methods have subsequentlyconcluded that, although the odor of n-butyl lactate is discernible atthe 7-ppm level, this concentration does not produce objectionable or injuriouseffects (Turner 1972/as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 82).In the preamble discussion of the proposed limit for this substance, OSHAnoted that some studies reported acute adverse effects associated withexposure levels below the proposed 5-ppm TWA limit. This was also pointedout by Dr. Grace Ziem, an independent physician (Ex. 46). Based on thestudy by Turner (1972, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 82), which employedimproved sampling and analytical techniques as compared to earlier studies,OSHA judges that promulgation of a 5-ppm 8-hour TWA limit will effectivelyprotect workers from the significant risks of irritation, headache, andnausea caused by exposure to higher conentrations of n-butyl lactate. OSHAconsiders these adverse effects to represent material impairments of health.Therefore, OSHA is establishing a 5-ppm 8-hour TWA limit for n-butyl lactate.<ITAG tagnum="71">n-BUTYL MERCAPTAN</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 109-79-5; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>SH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1054</ITAG>n-Butyl mercaptan is a colorless, flammable liquid and has a strong, obnoxious,garlic-like odor. It is used as a solvent, a chemical intermediate, andan odorant for natural gas. OSHA's previous limit for n-butyl mercaptanwas 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. OSHA proposed a lower limit of 0.5 ppm TWA,based on the ACGIH recommendation, and the final rule establishes thislimit.Humans exposed to concentrations of n-butyl mercaptan report that the ``readilynoticeable'' odor level for this substance is between 0.1 and 1 ppm, althoughthe odor threshold is significantly below this level (ranging from 0.001to 0.0001 ppm) Gobbato and Terribile (1968/Ex. 1-178) have reported thatsymptoms of CNS toxicity occurred in humans exposed for one hour to concentrationsof n-butyl mercaptan believed to lie in the range of 50 to 500 ppm. Thesesame authors reported that mucosal irritation occurred in human volunteersexposed to 4 ppm of ethyl mercaptan, a closely related substance. Irritationdid not occur at exposures to 0.4 ppm. The ACGIH established the TLV forn-butyl mercaptan at 0.5 ppm, to protect against the intolerable odor effects,mucosal irritation, and CNS toxicity that occur on exposure to higher concentrationsof this substance.The current PEL of 10 ppm is between 10 and 100 times higher than the concentrationof n-butyl mercaptan that is readily detected by smell and is more thantwice the concentration reported as causing mucosal irritation for a closelyrelated substance. OSHA finds that workers are at risk of significant acuteeffects in the absence of a more stringent limit.In its prehearing comments, NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N7) pointed out thatit has recommended a 0.5-ppm ceiling limit for n-butyl mercaptan, ratherthan a TWA limit, for this substance. No other comments were submittedto the record. In accordance with the criteria in its June 7, 1988 NPRM(53 <T3>FR</T3> 20977), OSHA is establishing the 0.5-ppm TWA limit for n-butylmercaptan. The Agency concludes that this PEL will substantially reducethe risks of irritation, CNS toxicity, and intolerable odor effects, whichtogether constitute material health impairments.<ITAG tagnum="71">CAPROLACTAM (DUST)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 105-60-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>11</T2>NO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The final rule establishes these limits. Caprolactamis a white crystalline solid with an unpleasant odor.In humans, caprolactam has been shown to be a convulsant, a dermal andrespiratory irritant, and a dermal sensitizer; however, dosage levels inhumans are ill-defined (Ferguson and Wheeler 1973/Ex. 1-1108; Tuma, Orson,Fossella, and Waidhofer 1981/Ex. 1-1071). In animals, exposure to caprolactamby several routes can cause convulsions, tremors, mydriasis, opisthotonus(Elison, Lien, Zinger et al. 1971/Ex. 1-1050; Lien, Lien, and Tong 1971/Ex.1-1089) and salivation (Goldblatt, Farquharson, Bennett, and Askew 1954/Ex.1-1044). Cardiovascular and respiratory effects have been reported in rabbitsand cats, with an initial increase in blood pressure followed by a decreasein blood pressure and an increased respiratory rate (Goldblatt, Farquharson,Bennett, and Askew 1954/Ex. 1-1044). Weight loss and initial growth depressionoccurred in rats and mice (Morrison, Ross, and Ruth 1980/Ex. 1-1062).One animal study observed that caprolactam's convulsant effects on rats,rabbits, and cats occur at injection doses above 100 mg/kg (Goldblatt,Farquharson, Bennett, and Askew 1954/Ex. 1-1044). Results of studies inguinea pigs were consistent with these findings (Hohensee 1951, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 95). In a 90-day feeding study of dogs, Burdock,Kolwick, Alsakor, and Marshall (1984, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.95) reported that dogs given dietary dose levels of 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 percentcaprolactam showed weight losses at both the 1.0-percent and 0.5-percentlevels. Hematologic and opthalmologic changes did not occur. In a two-yearbioassay of rats and mice, caprolactam was not observed to be carcinogenic(NCI/NTP 1982, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 95). A Polish study observedhematologic and systemic changes, increased mortality, kidney and liverdamage, and growth inhibition in animals given daily doses of 50 or 100mg/kg (Zwierzchowski, Kowalski, Szendzikowski, and Slusarchzyk-Zalobna1967, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 13, p. 96.1). The results of early studiesof caprolactam's teratogenicity in rats and rabbits indicate that it isnot teratogenic even at doses as high as 1000 mg/kg/day (Gad, Powers, Robinsonet al. 1984, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 96.1).Studies of industrial exposures to caprolactam dust in Germany report severeirritation on inhalation of 10 percent caprolactam in dust (Hohensee 1951,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 95). Workers experienced a bitter taste,nervousness, epistaxis, upper respiratory tract irritation, and dry andsplitting skin on the lips and nose (Hohensee 1951, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 95). Direct contact with the solid form of caprolactam producesprimary skin irritation (Ferguson 1972, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 96.1). Brief (1972, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 96.1) also reportsthat the dust produces skin irritation.OSHA received no comments, other than NIOSH's, on its proposed limits forcaprolactam dust. Based on its review of the health evidence, OSHA concludesthat, in the absence of any limit on employee exposure to caprolactam dust,workers are at significant risk of respiratory irritation, adverse nervoussystem effects, and possible cardiovascular effects; the Agency considersthese effects to be material impairments of health. OSHA finds that promulgationof the 1-mg/m\3\ TWA and 3-mg/m\3\ STEL limits for caprolactam dust willsubstantially reduce this risk.<ITAG tagnum="71">CAPROLACTAM (VAPOR)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 105-60-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>11</T2>NO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1065</ITAG>OSHA had no previous permissible exposure limit for caprolactam as vapor.The Agency proposed a TWA of 5 ppm (20 mg/m\3\) for the vapor, supplementedby a STEL of 10 ppm (40 mg/m\3\), based on the limits adopted by the ACGIH.These limits are established in the final rule. Caprolactam is a whitecrystalline solid at room temperature; thus, high vapor levels occur onlyat elevated temperatures.The health effects of exposure to caprolactam vapor are identical to thosedescribed for caprolactam dust, except that contact with the vapor is reportedto be even more irritating (Hohensee 1951, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 95). Workers exposed to the vapor at approximately 12 ppm complainedof a bitter taste in the mouth, nervousness, epistaxis, upper respiratorytract congestion, and dry and splitting skin; other workers reported experiencingheartburn, flatulence, and a heavy feeling in the stomach (Hohensee 1951,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 95).In another report of industrial exposure to the vapor, Ferguson and Wheeler(1973/Ex. 1-1108) reported that workers routinely exposed to unspecifiedlevels and occasionally to concentrations as high as 100 ppm for 18 yearsreported severe discomfort from burning nose, throat, and eyes. This irritationresponse was dose-related, with no workers reporting effects at 7 ppm orbelow, some experiencing transient upper respiratory tract irritation atlevels above that, and others reporting eye irritation at concentrationsof 25 ppm and above (Ferguson and Wheeler 1973/Ex. 1-1108). Ferguson (1972,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 96.1) noted that a group of 143 workers,some of whom were exposed for as long as 17 years to vapor concentrationsof 5 to 10 ppm, showed no evidence of adverse effects. At higher vaporexposures (13 to 130 ppm), all subjects experienced eye irritation (Ferguson1972, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 96.1). Human volunteers exposedat low relative humidities to concentrations of the vapor in the rangeof 10 to 100 ppm showed a dose-related response, but at higher relativehumidities, no irritation was observed below a concentration of 14 ppm(Ferguson and Wheeler 1973/Ex. 1-1108).NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N2; Tr. p. 3-86) did not concur with the Agency'sproposal to establish an 8-hour TWA exposure limit of 5 ppm (20 mg/m\3\)and a 10-ppm (40-mg/m\3\) STEL for caprolactam vapor. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47)noted that the 1986 ACGIH <T3>Documentation </T3>(Ex. 1-3) lists a TLV-TWA of 1 mg/m\3\ for the combinedvapor and aerosol of caprolactam and 0.22 ppm if the substance is presentonly as a vapor. The proposed change in the 1986 TLV was recommended toprevent early signs of irritation in some workers. NIOSH observed that``the proposed PEL does not appear to provide a sufficient margin of safetyto caprolactam vapor,'' based on available human exposure responses. Noother comments on this substance were submitted to the rulemaking record.As explained in Section IV.D. of this preamble, which discusses the boundariesof today's rulemaking, the Agency confined its attention to the substancesand exposure limits listed in the 1987-1988 edition of ACGIH's <T3>Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices </T3>(ACGIH1987/Ex. 1-16). Caprolactam vapor is listed on ACGIH's Notice of IntendedChanges but new limits have neither been reviewed nor adopted by that organizationto date. Under these circumstances, OSHA believes it prudent to promulgatethe limits as proposed for caprolactam vapor. The Agency is establishingan 8-hour TWA limit of 5 ppm (20 mg/m\3\) and a 15-minute STEL of 10 ppm(40 mg/m\3\) for this previously unregulated substance. OSHA concludesthat these PELs will substantially reduce the significant risk of eye,upper respiratory tract, and skin irritation that are permitted in theabsence of any exposure limit for caprolactam vapor. OSHA considers theirritant effects resulting from exposure to caprolactam vapor to be materialimpairments of health. The Agency will continue to monitor the health evidencefor this substance to determine whether further action is warranted.<ITAG tagnum="71">CESIUM HYDROXIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 21351-79-1; Chemical Formula; CsOH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1077</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no limit for cesium hydroxide; however, based on theACGIH recommendation, OSHA proposed the establishment of a 2-mg/m3 limitas an 8-hour TWA. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with OSHA's proposedlimit for this substance, and the Agency is establishing this limit forcesium hydroxide in the final rule. Cesium hydroxide is a colorless oryellowish fused crystalline mass; it is the strongest base known and ishighly soluble in both water and alcohol. Animal studies indicate that cesium hydroxide has an acute oral toxicityof about one-third that of potassium hydroxide, which causes lesions ofthe nasal septum and irritation of the eyes and respiratory tract (Karpov1971/Ex. 1-1115). The oral LD<T2>50</T2> for cesium hydroxide in rats is 1016 mg/kg. Although a concentrationof 5 percent cesium hydroxide did not produce skin irritation, contactwith this concentration did result in severe eye irritation. Cesium hydroxidedoes not cause skin sensitization (Johnson, Lewis, and Perone 1972, ascited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 113). No rulemaking participants otherthan NIOSH commented on the proposed 2-mg/m3 TWA limit for cesium hydroxide.In the final rule, the Agency is promulgating an 8-hour TWA PEL of 2 mg/m3for cesium hydroxide and concludes that this limit will protect workersfrom the significant risk of severe eye irritation associated with exposureto this substance at levels above the new PEL. The Agency considers thesevere eye irritation caused by exposure to cesium hydroxide a materialimpairment of health and functional capacity.<ITAG tagnum="71">CHLORINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7782-50-5; Chemical Formula: C1<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1079 </ITAG>The previous OSHA limit for chlorine was 1 ppm as a ceiling limit. OSHAproposed to revise this limit to 0.5 ppm measured over 15 minutes, whichwas the limit recommended by NIOSH (1976b/Ex. 1-276) in its criteria document;NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with the proposed limit. However,the final rule establishes a PEL of 0.5 ppm TWA with a 15-minute short-termexposure limit of 1 ppm for chlorine. Chlorine is a greenish-yellow, noncombustiblegas at atmospheric pressure; it has a suffocating odor. At ^35 C, it condensesto an amber liquid. Exposure to chlorine at concentrations around 5 ppm has been associatedwith respiratory symptoms, erosion of the teeth, and inflamation of themucous membranes (Flury and Zernik 1931c/Ex. 1-1199; Patty 1963c/Ex. 1-854).Ferris, Burgess, and Worcester (1967/Ex. 1-316) reported slight effectson the respiratory system in workers exposed to chlorine concentrationsranging from negligible to 7 ppm. Rupp and Henschler (1967/Ex. 1-1122)reported burning of the eyes among human subjects exposed to 0.5 ppm; anunspecified number of these subjects reported painful eyes after 15 minutes'exposure to this level. In a separate test, subjects reported respiratoryirritation on exposure to 0.5 ppm, and a concentration of 1 ppm was describedas being uncomfortable. At the time of OSHA's proposal, the limits adopted by the ACGIH were a1-ppm TLV-TWA and a 3-ppm TLV-STEL; these limits were based on the reportsdescribed above and were established to ``minimize chronic changes in thelungs, accelerated aging, and erosion of the teeth'' (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 117). NIOSH (1976b/Ex. 1-276) reviewed these studies, as did others(Matt 1889, as cited in Flury and Zernick 1931c/Ex. 1-1199; Beck 1959,as cited in NIOSH 1976b/Ex. 1-276) that reported ocular and respiratoryirritation associated with exposure to chlorine levels of around 1 ppmfor 30 minutes or less. NIOSH (1976b/Ex. 1-276) recommended a 15-minute0.5-ppm limit to prevent possible eye and respiratory tract irritation.The United Paperworkers International Union (UPIU) (Ex. 8-37) cited theNIOSH Criteria Document (Ex. 1-276) and ACGIH Documentation (Ex. 1-3) asevidence that exposure to 0.5 ppm chlorine causes respiratory irritation.The UPIU also submitted several studies indicating that decrements in pulmonaryfunction may persist for several days or weeks following acute exposureto concentrations of chlorine requiring medical treatment. In addition,the UPIU cited a number of studies indicating that pulp mill workers andchlorine production plant workers experience declines in pulmonary functionas a result of chronic exposure to low levels of chlorine (Ex. 8-37); however,interpretation of many of these studies is complicated by a lack of exposuredata or the presence of confounding exposure to other respiratory toxins,such as sulfur dioxide. The UPIU (Ex. 8-37) supported the promulgationof a 0.2 ppm limit for chlorine. In 1986, the ACGIH proposed revising the TLVs for chlorine to 0.5 ppm asan 8-hour TWA and 1 ppm as a 15-minute STEL. This proposal was based ona review of two recent studies. One study, a 1981 doctoral dissertationby Anglen (Ex. 108A), was sponsored by the Chlorine Institute and was conductedon 29 human subjects. This study reported statistically significant changesin pulmonary function and subjective irritation resulting from exposureto 1 ppm chlorine for eight hours. No significant ocular effects were notedat this exposure level and duration. Exposure to 0.5 ppm for eight hourswas not associated with significant declines in pulmonary function, andsubjective irritation was also less severe at this level than at 1 ppm(Anglen 1981, Ex. 108A). During the eight-hour exposure to 1 ppm, sensoryresponses of itching or burning of the throat were reported to be ``justperceptible'' or ``distinctly perceptible.'' A short-term (30)-minute)exposure to 2 ppm produced no increase in subjective irritation comparedwith controls. These findings were confirmed in a study of eight healthy volunteers exposedto 0.5 or 1 ppm chlorine concentrations (Rotman, Fliegelman, Moore et al.1983/Ex. 1-108B). Significant declines in pulmonary function were associatedwith exposure to 1 ppm but not to 0.5 ppm. The Chlorine Institute (Ex. 3-828) described a recent animal study conductedby the Chemical Industry Institute of Toxicology (CIIT). In this study,groups of 20 rats were exposed to 1, 3, or 9 ppm chlorine for six hours/day,five days/week, for six weeks. Exposure to the two highest levels resultedin significant decreases in body weight. Inflammation of the upper and/orlower respiratory tract was observed in the 9-ppm group and, to a lesserextent, in the 3- and 1-ppm groups. Pathological and clinical changes werenot observed in the 1-ppm group, but were seen in the 3- and 9-ppm groups.Several rulemaking participants urged OSHA to adopt the more recent ACGIHlimits of 0.5 ppm TWA and 1 ppm STEL (Exs. 3-677, 3-741, 3-828, and 3-1150;Tr. pp. 10-165 to 10-170; Tr. pp. 10-178 to 10-180). For example, the ChlorineInstitute commented as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The imposition of an instantaneous ceiling PEL is inappropriate. TheChlorine Institute's University of Michigan and CIIT studies demonstrateconclusively that sensory effects and adverse pulmonary function effectsare directly related to prolonged chlorine exposures and are correctlycontrolled by a PEL expressed as a Time Weighted Average (TWA) * * *. TheChlorine Institute supports * * * [the ACGIH limits] as the correct PELfor adoption by OSHA, and we submit that the evidence is conclusive thatsuch a PEL is totally protective of worker health in chlorine-producingand chlorine-using industries (Ex. 3-828, p. 3).</ITAG>In its posthearing comment, NIOSH (Ex. 150) reaffirmed its recommendedTWA of 0.5 ppm as a 15-minute limit, based on the findings of Rupp andHenschler (1967/Ex. 1-1122):<ITAG tagnum="21">The studies of Anglen (1981) and Rotman (1983), as summarized by theACGIH, if considered alone, would support the ACGIH TWA TLV of 0.5 ppmwith a STEL of 1 ppm. However, in the studies of Rupp and Henschler (1967),exposure to chlorine at concentrations of approximately 0.5 ppm resultedin conjunctival pain in several subjects after 15 minutes; in their secondstudy, subjects reported respiratory irritation after exposure to 0.5 ppmfor 25 minutes * * *. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Rupp and Henschler study (1967), although it has been criticizedfor lack of a control group (Ex. 3-685) confirms the Anglen (1981), Rotmanet al. (1983), and CIIT studies (Ex. 3-828) that there is a significantrisk of irritation and a risk of respiratory inflammation at the presentPEL of 1 ppm ceiling. Reduction of the current PEL to 0.5 ppm ceiling willreduce the risk of respiratory irritation and pulmonary function changes,and minimize the subjective complaints of irritation (Ex. 150, Commentson Chlorine).</ITAG>The Dow Chemical Company submitted a critical review of the NIOSH (1976b/Ex.1-276) criteria document on chlorine and the Rupp and Henschler (1967/Ex.1-1122) study that was prepared in 1979 by Dr. Ralph G. Smith, who directedthe University of Michigan (Anglen 1981) study (Ex. 3-741, Appendix B;Tr. pp. 10-165 to 10-170). In his review, Dr. Smith criticized the Ruppand Henschler (1967/Ex. 1-1122) study because the design of the exposurefacility led to uncertainties in determining actual exposure levels presentin the test room. He also remarked that the chlorine was passed through``liquid paraffin,'' which may have produced chlorinated hydrocarbons.In addition, Dr. Smith felt that the air compressor used may have causedcontamination of the air in the test room by carbon monoxide and otherimpurities. Dr. Smith believed these observations were important ``becauseone of the effects allegedly resulting from short exposures to low levelsof chlorine was headaches, a symptom which we have never had reported tous by a subject in the University of Michigan (Anglen 1981) exposures''(Ex. 3-741, Appendix B, pp. 9-10). After reviewing the evidence and testimony presented in the record on theeffects of exposure to chlorine gas, OSHA concludes that there is clearlya significant risk of pulmonary function impairment and sensory irritationat the current 1-ppm ceiling PEL; such effects have been demonstrated bythe Anglen (1981/Ex. 108A) and Rotman, Fliegelman, Moore et al. (1983/Ex.108B) studies in human subjects exposed to 1 ppm for 8 hours, an exposurelevel and duration that would be permitted by the former PEL. In addition,pulmonary inflammation has been observed in rats exposed daily for sixweeks to 1 ppm chlorine. Therefore, OSHA finds that it is necessary torevise its current limit for chlorine. The human studies by Anglen (1981/Ex. 108A) and by Rotman, Fliegelman,Moore et al. (1983/Ex. 108B) also indicate that exposure to 0.5 ppm chlorinefor as long as 8 hours is not associated with impairment of pulmonary functionor significant sensory irritation; these findings are in contrast to theearlier German reports upon which the NIOSH REL of 0.5 ppm (15 minutes)is based. However, the German studies, in particular those of Rupp andHenschler (1967/Ex. 1-1122), appear to have had methodological shortcomingsthat call into question the finding that exposure to 0.5 ppm chlorine isassociated with significant acute effects. Therefore, OSHA judges, basedon the more recent University of Michigan study, that an exposure limitof 0.5 ppm TWA with a 1-ppm 15 minute STEL will reduce the risk of irritationand pulmonary function decline in workers, and is today revising its limitfor chlorine to these values. OSHA considers the effects of respiratoryirritation and the declines in pulmonary function associated with chlorineexposure to be material impairments of health. <ITAG tagnum="71">CHLOROACETYL CHLORIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 79-04-9; Chemical Formula: ClCH<T2>2</T2>COC1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1083</ITAG>No previous exposure limit existed for chloroacetyl chloride. OSHA proposeda 0.05-ppm 8-hour TWA limit for this substance, based on the ACGIH recommendation,and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal. This limitis established in the final rule. Chloroacetyl chloride is a colorlessliquid with a pungent odor. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats fed this substance is between 0.12 and 0.25 g/kg. Chloroacetylchloride is corrosive to the skin and eyes, and skin absorption of thissubstance can be lethal. Inhalation of 4 ppm for five to ten minutes causedrespiratory problems in rats; however, no effect was observed in theseanimals when they inhaled 2.5 ppm for a period of seven hours (Dow ChemicalCompany 1977a, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 122). Thirty-day inhalationstudies with rats, mice, and hamsters showed eye and respiratory irritationat 2.5 ppm and no effect at 0.5 ppm (Dow Chemical Company 1977a, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 122). Reports of the acute effects associated with exposure to chloroacetyl chloridein humans include mild to moderate skin burns and erythema, eye burns andtearing, cough, dyspnea, and cyanosis, as well as mild gastrointestinaleffects. Eye and respiratory irritation occurred in an industrial settingcharacterized by an exposure level of 0.009 to 0.017 ppm, with excursionsas high as 0.140 ppm (Dow Chemical Company 1977a, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 122). An accidental drenching with a mixture containing chloroacetylchloride resulted in extensive first- and second-degree burns, pulmonaryedema, and three episodes of cardiac arrest, followed by coma and anoxia-inducedbrain damage (Pagnotto 1978, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 122). Otheringredients of the mixture involved in the accident included xylidine,benzene, and sodium carbonate. Rescuers of this victim experienced handblisters, chest tightness, and nausea for two days. OSHA received no commentsother than NIOSH's on the proposed 0.05-ppm TWA limit for chloroacetylchloride. The Agency concludes that an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.05 ppm for chloroacetylchloride is necessary to protect employees from the significant risk ofeye, skin, and respiratory irritation; gastrointestinal effects; and severesystemic effects, including life-threatening coma, cardiac arrest, andpulmonary edema, to which they could otherwise be exposed in the absenceof any OSHA limit; the Agency considers each of these exposure-relatedadverse effects to be material impairments of health and functional capacity.Accordingly, OSHA is establishing an occupational limit of 0.05 ppm asan 8-hour TWA for chloroacetyl chloride.<ITAG tagnum="71">o-CHLOROBENZYLIDENE MALONONITRILE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 2698-41-1; Chemical Formula: ClC<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>CH = C(CN)<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1084</ITAG>OSHA's previous PEL for o-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (OCBM) was 0.05ppm as an 8-hour TWA. The Agency has proposed revising this limit to 0.05ppm as a ceiling, with a skin notation, based on the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3)recommendation. This revision is incorporated in the final rule. NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with OSHA's proposed limit for this substance.o-Chlorobenzylidene malononitrile is a white crystalline solid with a pepper-likeodor. OCBM has extremely irritating properties. It couses intense eye and skinirritation, coughing, difficulty in breathing, chest tightness, runningnose, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. These effects are evident on exposureto concentrations between 12 and 20 mg/m3 (1.5 to 2.5 ppm), and they becomeincapacitating within 20 seconds of exposure; the effects persist for approximately5 to 10 minutes after the victim has been removed to fresh air (<T3>Military Chemistry and Chemical Agents</T3> 1963, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 124).OCBM is only slightly toxic to laboratory animals when they are exposedintravenously, subcutaneously, or through inhalation (Punte, Weimer, Ballard,and Wilding 1962/Ex. 1-354). In animals, it has been demonstrated thatOCBM is metabolized by the body into cyanide (Frankenberg and Sorbo 1973/Ex.1-480). Short-term exposures to high levels of OCBM did not cause carcinogenic,teratogenic, or embryolethal effects in animals (McNamara et al. 1973,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 124). Three of four human volunteers exposed to a 1.5-mg/m3 (0.19-ppm) concentrationof OCBM aerosol dispersed from a 10-percent solution of methylene chloridefor 90 minutes developed headaches, and one showed mild eye and nose irritation.Headache persisted for 24 hours in two subjects. At 4 to 5 mg/m3 (0.5 to0.6 ppm), subjects' problem-solving abilities were affected and they showedeye irritation, conjunctivitis, lacrimation, and skin burning (Punte, Owens,and Gutentag 1963/Ex. 1-353). Other researchers observed no persistentclinical abnormalities in seven subjects exposed to OCBM at concentrationsranging from 1 to 13 mg/m3 (0.13 to 1.6 ppm) over a 15-day period; however,none of these subjects developed a tolerance for the compound. Severe skinsensitization has also been reported in workers handling OCBM (Shmunesand Taylor 1973/Ex. 1-370). No comments, except those submitted by NIOSH,were received on OSHA's proposed revision of the limit for OCBM.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a PEL 0.05 ppm as a ceiling, witha skin notation, to reduce the risks associated with elevated short-termexposures to OCBM. The Agency concludes that workers are at significantrisk of experiencing the severe eye and upper respiratory tract irritation,skin sensitization, dyspnea, nausea, lacrimation, vomiting, and performancedecrements that are associated with brief exposures to this substance atthe former 8-hour TWA PEL. Furthermore, OSHA considers the effects relatedto exposure to OCBM to represent material impairments of health.<ITAG tagnum="71">CYANOGEN</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 460-19-5; Chemical Formula: (CN)<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1105</ITAG>OSHA previously had no limit for cyanogen. The Agency proposed a limitof 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWA for this colorless gas, which has a pungent,almond-like odor. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal,and the final rule establishes the 10 ppm TWA limit, which is the sameas that recommended by the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3).The acute toxicity for cyanogen in various animal species is high (Fluryand Zernick 1931d, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 154). One hundredppm was fatal to cats in two to three hours, and 400 ppm was fatal to rabbitsin less than two hours. However, rabbits exposed to 100 ppm for four hoursshowed practically no effects. Cats exposed to 50 ppm were severely affectedbut recovered (Flury and Zernik 1931d, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 154). Investigations in the rat suggest that cyanogen is approximately10 times less acutely toxic than is hydrogen cyanide (McNerney and Schrenk1960/Ex. 1-426). Human tests showed that subjects experienced almost immediate eye and nasalirritation at exposures of 16 ppm (McNerney and Schrenk 1960/Ex. 1-426).The New Jersey Department of Public Health (Exs. 144, 144A) urged OSHAto set a limit for cyanogen on the basis of EPA's IRIS data. The use ofsuch an approach is discussed in Section VI.A of the preamble. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit for cyanogen.The Agency concludes that this limit is necessary to protect against thesignificant risk of irritation and systemic effects associated with exposureat the levels permitted in the absence of any OSHA limit. OSHA considersthe irritant and systemic effects caused by exposure to cyanogen to bematerial impairments of health.<ITAG tagnum="71">CYANOGEN CHLORIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 506-77-4; Chemical Formula: C1CN</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 0.3-ppm ceiling limit, whichis the same as that recommended by the ACGIH.The chronic effects of exposure to cyanogen chloride, which include hoarseness,conjunctivitis, and edema of the eyelid, have long been recognized (Reed1920/Ex. 1-355). Flury and Zernik (1931d, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 155) observed the effects of exposure to cyanogen chloride in five animalspecies. In mice, a concentration of approximately 500 ppm was fatal withinthree minutes; in cats, 120 ppm was fatal in 3.5 minutes; 48 ppm was fatalto dogs in six hours; in goats, a 1000-ppm exposure for three minutes causeddeath after 70 hours; and 1200 ppm was fatal to the rabbit. Several otherstudies have demonstrated that animals exposed to cyanogen chloride exhibitpulmonary edema and interference with cellular metabolism (Jandorf andBodansky 1946/Ex. 1-334; Aldridge and Evans 1946/Ex. 1-708). Human data indicate that 1 ppm is the lowest irritant concentration thatcan be tolerated for a 10-minute exposure; 2 ppm was intolerable for thistime period, and 48 ppm was fatal in 30 minutes (Prentiss 1937/Ex. 1-1164).The Michigan Department of Health (1977, as cited by ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 155) reported that a concentration of about 0.7 ppm caused severe eyeand nasal irritation, forcing workers to evacuate the area. NIOSH submittedthe only comment received by OSHA on its proposed ceiling limit of 0.3ppm for cyanogen chloride.OSHA is establishing this 0.3-ppm ceiling limit for cyanogen chloride inthe final rule. The Agency concludes that a ceiling limit is necessaryto protect workers from the significant risks of severe irritation, metaboliceffects, and pulmonary edema associated with short-term exposures to thissubstance at levels above the former PEL. The Agency considers the irritant,metabolic, and respiratory effects associated with exposure to cyanogenchloride to be material impairments of health and functional capacity.<ITAG tagnum="71">DIBUTYL PHOSPHATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-66-4; Chemical Formula: (n-C<T2>4</T2>H<T2>9</T2>O)<T2>2</T2>(OH)PO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1119</ITAG>OSHA previously had an 8-hour TWA PEL of 1 ppm for dibutyl phosphate. TheAgency proposed to supplement this limit with a 2-ppm STEL, based on theACGIH recommendation. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal,and the final rule establishes a 1-ppm TWA limit with a 2-ppm STEL forthis substance.There are no published reports of toxic reactions caused by exposure todibutyl phosphate. However, in a personal communication to the ACGIH, Mastromatteoreported that workers exposed to relatively low levels of dibutyl phosphatedeveloped respiratory tract irritation and headache (Mastromatteo 1964a,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 236). No additional data or health effectscomment was introduced into the record during the rulemaking proceeding. OSHA concludes that both a TWA and a STEL are necessary to protect workersfrom the risk of respiratory tract irritation and headaches reported tooccur at low levels of exposure. OSHA judges it likely that, in the absenceof a STEL, short-term exposure permitted by the 1-ppm TWA limit alone maybe sufficiently high to present a significant risk of respiratory tractirritation and headache to workers; the Agency considers these exposure-relatedeffects to be material impairments of health. Therefore, the Agency issupplementing its 1-ppm 8-hour TWA limit with a 2-ppm 15-minute STEL inthe final rule.   <ITAG tagnum="71">1,3-DICHLORO-5,5-DIMETHYL HYDANTOIN  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 118-52-5; Chemical Formula: C<T2>5</T2>H<T2>6</T2>C1<T2>2</T2>N<T2>2</T2>O<T2>2</T2>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Based on the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) recommendation, theAgency proposed a TWA limit of 0.2 mg/m3 and a STEL of 0.4 mg/m3 for thiswhite powder, which has a mild odor similar to that of chlorine. NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with OSHA's proposed limits for this substance,and they are established in the final rule.  1,3-Dichloro-5,5-dimethyl hydantoin produces systemic toxicity in laboratoryanimals. The acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats of both sexes is 542andplusmin;84 mg/kg when DCDMH isadministered as a 10-percent aqueous suspension. Rats dying within 48 hoursof administration showed gastrointestinal hemorrhage at necropsy. The animalstolerated aqueous solutions of DCDMH maintained at 20 ppm available chlorine(Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories 1961 and 1962, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 183).  Limited human exposure data have been provided by Baier, who reported thatindividuals experienced extreme respiratory irritation at an average levelof 1.97 mg/m3, but that some experienced this degree of irritation evenat 0.7 mg/m3 (Baier 1964, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 183). Otherthan the NIOSH submission, OSHA received no comments on its proposal torevise the limit for DCDMH.  The 0.2-mg/m3 TWA and 0.4-mg/m3 STEL limits that were proposed are basedon evidence of systemic toxicity in laboratory animals and respiratoryirritation at low exposure levels in human subjects. The Agency concludesthat both a TWA and a STEL are required to protect exposed workers fromthe risk of respiratory irritation that has been shown to occur at levelsonly slightly above the level specified by the 8-hour TWA limit. OSHA considersthe respiratory irritant effects associated with exposure to DCDMH to representmaterial impairment of health and functional capacity. OSHA also concludesthat the combined TWA-STEL limits will reduce this risk substantially andis therefore establishing a 0.2-mg/m3 TWA and a 0.4-mg/m3 STEL for DCDMH. <ITAG tagnum="71">DICHLOROETHYL ETHER  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 111-44-4; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>2</T2>ClCH<T2>2</T2>)<T2>2</T2>O  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1127</ITAG>OSHA previously had a 15-ppm ceiling limit, with a skin notation, for dichloroethylether. The Agency proposed to revise its limit for dichloroethyl etherto 5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, with a 10-ppm STEL, and to retain the skin notation.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A; Tr. pp. 3-96 to 3-97) concurred with the proposedlimits but indicated that a carcinogen designation should be added to thePEL. The final rule establishes the proposed limits, which are consistentwith the ACGIH recommendation. Dichloroethyl ether is a colorless, flammableliquid with a nauseating odor.  The primary health hazards associated with exposure to this substance areirritation of the eyes and respiratory system and pulmonary damage. Schrenk,Patty, and Yant (1933/Ex. 1-665) reported that guinea pigs exposed to thevapor of dichloroethyl ether at 500 ppm experienced immediate and severeeye and nose irritation, respiratory disturbances after 1.5 to 3 hours,and death after five to eight hours. Lung, kidney, liver, and brain damagewere also observed in these animals; exposure to a reduced level of 105ppm caused eventual death after 10 hours of continuous exposure. A one-hourexposure to 105 ppm caused irritation only (Carpenter, Smyth, and Pozzani1949/Ex. 1-772). At 35 ppm, for an upspecified duration, irritation butno other adverse effects were observed (Schrenk, Patty, and Yant 1933/Ex.1-665). Rats responded similarly, with four-hour exposures to 250 ppm provinglethal (Carpenter, Smyth, and Pozzani 1949/Ex. 1-722).  Repeated exposures to 69 ppm (seven hours/day, five days/week for 130 days)caused no serious injury in rats or guinea pigs; only mild stress-relatedeffects were noted (Kosyan 1967/Ex. 1-914). However, other studies of guineapigs have shown mild primary irritative effects on the skin, and fatalitiesoccurred when 300 mg/kg was applied dermally as a pure liquid for 24 hours(Smyth and Carpenter 1948/Ex. 1-375). Direct contact of dichloroethyl etherwith the eye causes moderate pain, conjunctival irritation, and transientcorneal injury (Carpenter and Smyth 1946/Ex. 1-859). A sufficient amountof dichloroethyl ether can be absored through the skin to be lethal: Saxand Lewis (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials,</T3> 7th ed., 1989) reportthe dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits as 720 mg/kg. Mice have been reported to develophepatomas after prolonged oral administration (80 weeks) of dichloroethylether at 300 mg/kg (Innes, Ulland, Valerio et al. 1969/Ex. 1-270).  Humans exposed briefly to dichloroethyl ether at concentrations above 550ppm experienced intolerable eye and nasal irritation, with coughing, nausea,and retching. Concentrations between 100 and 260 ppm were irritating buttolerable; however, the odor of dichloroethyl ether was still nauseatingat 35 ppm (Schrenk, Patty, and Yant 1933/Ex. 1-665). Eye irritation hasbeen reported from industrial exposure to a concentration of dichloroethylether at 2.5 ppm (Bell and Jones 1958/Ex. 1-714). A single fatality, presumablyfrom inhalation of the vapor, has been reported but not documented (Elkins1959c, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 186). NIOSH submitted the onlycomments on OSHA's proposed revision of the PEL for dichloroethyl ether.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 5 ppm TWA and 10 ppm STEL forthis substance. The Agency concludes that a 5-ppm TWA and a 10-ppm STELwill protect workers against the significant risk of irritation, lung injury,and nausea associated with occupational exposure to elevated levels ofdichloroethyl ether, and these limits are established in the final rule.OSHA considers the eye and nasal irritation, lung injury, and other symptomsassociated with exposure to dichloroethyl ether to be material impairmentsof health and functional capacity. The skin notation is retained becausedichloroethyl ether can cause systemic toxicity if percutaneously absorbed.<ITAG tagnum="71">2,2-DICHLOROPROPIONIC ACID</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-99-0; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CC1<T2>2</T2>C00H</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1130</ITAG>OSHA previously had no limit for 2,2-dichloropropionic acid; however, theAgency proposed a 1-ppm 8-hour TWA limit for this liquid, based on theACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) recommendation. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurredwith the proposed 1-ppm TWA limit, and the final rule establishes it.In a communication to the ACGIH, the Dow Chemical Company (1977b, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 190) reported that 2,2-dichloropropionic acidis corrosive to the skin and can cause permanent injury to the eye. Theoral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is between 0.7 and 1 g/kg. Seven-hour exposures toa saturated atmosphere of the acid vapor caused no ill effects in rats,and a 120-day study of dietary exposure in rats showed a no-effect levelof 15 mg/kg/day (Dow Chemical Company 1977b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 190). Dr. Grace Ziem, an independent occupational physician (Ex.46), commented that Dow's material safety data sheet on 2,2-dichloropropionicacid reports that the liver and kidneys are target organs in rats fed higherdietary levels.Acute human exposures have been reported to cause mild to moderate skin,eye, respiratory, and gastrointestinal irritation. Minimal respiratoryirritation was observed in workers exposed at concentrations of between2 and 7 ppm (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 190).The Agency concludes that a 1 ppm TWA limit for 2,2-dichloropropionic acidwill protect workers from the significant risk of eye, respiratory, andgastrointestinal irritation, and possible liver or kidney injury, at exposurelevels permitted in the absence of any OSHA limit. The Agency considersthe irritant and adverse organ effects associated with exposure to thissubstance to be material impairments of health and functional capacity.Therefore, OSHA is establishing a 1-ppm 8-hour TWA limit for 2,2-dichloropropionicacid.<ITAG tagnum="71">DIETHYLAMINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 109-89-7; Chemical Formula: (C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>)<T2>2</T2>NH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1137</ITAG>OSHA's previous limit for diethylamine was 25 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. TheAgency proposed to lower this limit to an 8-hour TWA of 10 ppm and to adda 15-minute STEL of 25 ppm, based on the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) recommendation.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with these proposed limits, whichare established in the final rule. Diethylamine is a colorless liquid withan ammonia-like odor.Diethylamine is a strong irritant of the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes,and chronic sublethal exposures cause tracheitis, bronchitis, pneumonitis,and pulmonary edema (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 197). In rabbits, the dermalLD<T2>50</T2> is 0.82 ml/kg, and instillation of solutions of 1 percent orgreater into the eyes of rabbits caused corneal opacity (Sutton 1963/Ex.1-1101). Direct contact of the skin with diethylamine causes necrosis (ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 197). Rabbits exposed seven hours/day, five days/weekfor six weeks to 50 or 100 ppm diethylamine survived; those exposed to50 ppm showed marked lung and corneal irritation, and, occasionally, degenerationof the heart muscle (Brieger and Hodes 1951/Ex. 1-408). In the animalsexposed to 100 ppm, these changes were more severe, and the parenchymatousdegeneration of the heart muscle was marked (Brieger and Hodes 1951/Ex.1-408).OSHA finds that its previous limit of 25 ppm as an 8-hour TWA is only one-halfthe level found to cause marked lung and corneal irritation in animalsexposed for six weeks. The Agency concludes that the 25-ppm limit is notsufficient to protect workers from the significant risk of skin burns,corneal injury, pulmonary irritation, and skin, eye, and upper respiratorytract irritation potentially associated with more prolonged exposures tothis substance. OSHA considers the exposure-related effects of diethylamineon the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract to be material impairments ofhealth. To afford workers greater protection from these adverse effects,OSHA is revising its limit for diethylamine to 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWAand 25 ppm as a 15-minute STEL; these limits are established in the finalrule.<ITAG tagnum="71">DIISOBUTYL KETONE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-83-8; Chemical Formula: [(CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2>CHCH<T2>2</T2>]<T2>2</T2>CO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1140</ITAG>OSHA previously had an 8-hour limit of 50 ppm TWA for diisobutyl ketone.The Agency proposed to reduce this limit to 25 ppm TWA, based on both theACGIH and NIOSH recommendations. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred withthis proposal, and the final rule revises OSHA's limit for diisobutyl ketoneto 25 ppm as an 8-hour time-weighted average.The primary health effects associated with exposure to diisobutyl ketoneare eye, nose, and throat irritation, although experimental animals haveshown some systemic effects. Diisobutyl ketone has a uniformly low acutetoxicity by all routes of exposure. Rats and guinea pigs survived singleexposures of from 7.5 to 16 hours to essentially saturated vapor (McOmieand Anderson 1949/Ex. 1-918). Smyth, Carpenter, and Weil (1949/Ex. 1-528)reported that five of six rats died after exposure to 2000 ppm for eighthours; these investigators also reported a percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> for rabbits of greater than 20 ml/kg. Direct application ofdiisobutyl ketone to rabbit skin was only mildly irritating, and no eyeirritation was reported after instillation of this substance into the rabbiteye. The oral toxicity for the rat was reported as 5.8 g/kg (Smyth, Carpenter,and Weil 1949/Ex. 1-528). Carpenter and Smyth (1946/Ex. 1-859) reporteda no-effect level for diisobutyl ketone of 125 ppm in rats and guinea pigsgiven 30 seven-hour exposures. At 250 ppm, the liver and kidney weightsof female rats increased, and the liver weights of male guinea pigs decreased;at levels of 530 and 920 ppm, rats showed increased liver and kidney weights;and at 1650 ppm, increased mortality was noted (Carpenter and Smyth 1946/Ex.1-859).Silverman, Schulte, and First (1946/Ex. 1-142) reported eye irritationand complaints of objectionable odor in volunteer human exposures to concentrationsabove 25 ppm. No worker illnesses have been linked to diisobutyl ketoneexposure (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 203).NIOSH (Ex. 150, Comments on Diisobutyl Ketone) concurred with OSHA's proposalto reduce the limit for diisobutyl ketone and reported that there are nonew toxicological data beyond those described above; no other commentson this substance were received. The Agency concludes that the previous50-ppm TWA limit is inadequate to protect workers against the significantrisk of irritation associated with workplace exposures to diisobutyl ketonelevels greater than 25 ppm. The Agency has determined that the irritationassociated with exposure to diisobutyl ketone constitutes a material impairmentof health and functional capacity. Therefore, OSHA is revising its limitfor diisobutyl ketone to 25 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.<ITAG tagnum="71">EPICHLOROHYDRIN</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 106-89-8; Chemical Formula: C<T2>3</T2>H<T2>5</T2>C10</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1158</ITAG>OSHA previously had a limit of 5 ppm TWA, with a skin notation, for epichlorohydrin.OSHA proposed to reduce this limit to 2 ppm TWA, also with a skin notation,based on the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) recommendation, and the final rule establishesan 8-hour TWA limit of 2 ppm and retains the skin designation. Epichlorohydrinis an unstable liquid with an odor like that of chloroform.In animals, epichlorohydrin is irritating and systemically toxic by allroutes of exposure (Shell Chemical Corporation 1958, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 233). Fatalities are caused by central nervous systemand respiratory tract effects resulting from exposure to high concentrations.In mice, single 30-minute exposures to 8300 ppm of epichlorohydrin vaporcaused muscular paralysis and death from respiratory failure; similar resultshave been reported for dermal application of the liquid at 0.5 ml/kg inrats, and repeated oral administration at 0.1 mg/kg in mice (Shell ChemicalCorporation 1958, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 233). At 32 ppm (sevenhours/day, five days/week) for 91 days, rats failed to show normal weightgain, and at 16 ppm they showed increased kidney size (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 233). Gage (1959/Ex. 1-1052) confirmed these findings and demonstratedlung, liver, and kidney injury in rats from repeated six-hour exposuresat concentrations ranging from 17 to 120 ppm. No effects were observedby this author at 9 ppm. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is reported as 260 mg/kg, and the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is reported as 755 mg/kg (Lawrence, Malik, Turner,and Autian 1972/Ex. 1-1058). A four-hour exposure at a level of 250 ppmwas fatal to rats (Carpenter, Smyth, and Pozzani 1949/Ex. 1-722).NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B) did not concur with OSHA's proposed limit forepichlorohydrin, and considers this substance a potential human carcinogenand a likely candidate for a 6(b) rulemaking. There have been reports ofcarcinogenicity in mice resulting from both dermal application and subcutaneousinjection of epichlorohydrin (Van Duuren, Goldschmidt, Katz et al. 1974/Ex.1-969), as well as indications of reproductive effects resulting from ingestion;in addition, mutagenic effects have been observed in microbial systemsand in the fruit fly (NIOSH 1976c/Ex. 1-972).In humans exposed to concentrations above 100 ppm for brief periods, lungedema and kidney lesions have been reported (NIOSH 1976c/Ex. 1-972). Exposureat 20 ppm caused burning of eyes and nasal mucosa (Wexler 1971, as citedin NIOSH 1976c/Ex. 1-972). Another exposure to an unknown concentrationcaused eye and throat irritation, nausea, dyspnea, bronchitis, and an enlargedliver (Schultz 1964/Ex. 1-1064). Painful irritation of subcutaneous tissuesfollows skin contact in humans (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3. p. 233). The New JerseyDepartment of Public Health (Exs. 144, 144A) urged OSHA to establish aPEL for epichlorohydrin on the basis of EPA's IRIS data. The use of suchan approach is discussed in Section VI.A of the preamble.OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 2 ppm, with a skin notation,for epichlorohydrin. The Agency concludes that this limit will protectworkers from the significant risk of dermal, respiratory, liver, and kidneyeffects that are potentially associated with exposure to epichlorohydrinat elevated concentrations. OSHA has determined that the respiratory, liver,kidney, and dermal effects associated with exposure to epichlorohydrinrepresent material impairments of health. The skin notation is retainedbecause of this substance's capacity to penetrate the skin and cause toxicity;according to Lawrence, Malik, Turner, and Autian 1972/Ex. 1-1058, the dermalLD<T2>50</T2> of epichlorohydrin in rabbits is 755 mg/kg.<ITAG tagnum="71">ETHYL BENZENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 100-41-4; Chemical Formula C<T2>8</T2>H<T2>10</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1162</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for ethyl benzene was 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. Basedon the skin and mucous membrane irritant properties associated with exposureto ethyl benzene, OSHA proposed permissible exposure limits for this substanceof 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 125 ppm as a 15-minute STEL. NIOSH (Ex.8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal. The final rule establisheslimits of 100 ppm TWA and 125 ppm STEL for ethyl benzene; these limitsare consistent with the ACGIH recommendation. Ethyl benzene is a colorless,flammable liquid with an aromatic odor.The Agency's decision to add a STEL to the existing time-weighted averagelimit reflects evidence that transient eye irritation occurs in humansat vapor concentrations of 200 ppm; the short-term limit is necessary toprotect exposed workers from the risk of such irritation as a result ofeven brief excursions above the 100-ppm level.Written comments submitted by ARCO Chemical Company (ACC) (Ex. 3-638) includea detailed discussion of ethyl benzene's toxicity in animals, as reportedin several recent studies (ECETOC 1986; Dynamac Corporation 1986) and ina personal communication from the National Toxicology Program's ChemicalManager for Ethyl Benzene. The findings of these investigators include:Moderate dermal irritation on intact and abraded rabbit skin after a 24-hourapplication; mild conjunctival irritation (without corneal effects) fromdirect instillation of undiluted ethyl benzene in rabbit eyes; erythemaand edema with superficial necrosis, resulting in exfoliation of largepatches of skin, following repeated and prolonged application of the undilutedmaterial to rabbit skin; ``a slight, cloudy swelling of hepatocytes'' inanimals subchronically exposed to the vapor as a ``result of an increasein the endoplasmic reticulum (SER), which is an adaptive process responsiblefor increased microsomal enzyme activity and, presumably, increased metabolismof ethyl benzene''; congestion of the lungs, nasal mucosa, liver, and kidneysin mice and rats exposed six hours/day for four consecutive days to ethylbenzene concentrations of 2360 ppm and in mice exposed to 1190 ppm; andlacrimation and salivation in rats exposed at 400 and 800 ppm for six hours/day,five days/week (ECETOC 1986 and Dynamac Corporation 1986, both as citedin Ex. 3-638). ACC stressed the fact that, except at very high concentrations,significant systemic toxicity does not appear to be a manifestation ofethyl benzene exposure.In addition to providing the results of these up-to-date studies on thehealth effects in animals of ethyl benzene exposure, the ACC indicatedits support for both the retention of the current 100-ppm TWA limit andthe adoption of a 125-ppm 15-minute STEL for ethyl benzene. Both concentrations,according to the ACC, ``provide a wide safety margin for eye irritationcompared to the concentration which can be tolerated in the workplace (1000ppm).''The New Jersey Department of Health (Exs. 144, 144A) urged OSHA to seta PEL for ethyl benzene on the basis of EPA's IRIS data. The use of suchan approach is discussed in Section VI.A of the preamble.OSHA concludes that workers exposed to concentrations of ethyl benzeneabove the 100-ppm level, even briefly, are at significant risk of experiencingirritation; the Agency considers this to be a material impairment of health.Accordingly, the Agency is establishing a short-term limit of 125 ppm fora 15-minute period to supplement the existing 100-ppm time-weighted-averagelimit for ethyl benzene.<ITAG tagnum="71">ETHYL ETHER</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 60-29-7; Chemical Formula: C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>OC<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1164</ITAG>OSHA's previous limit for ethyl ether was a 400-ppm TWA. The Agency proposedthe same time-weighted-average TWA limit, with the addition of a 15-minuteSTEL of 500 ppm. These limits are established in the final rule and areconsistent with those recommended by the ACGIH. Ethyl ether is a colorless,volatile, mobile liquid with a distinct odor and a burning, sweet taste.It is extremely flammable and is a severe fire and explosion hazard whenexposed to heat or flame.Ethyl ether causes narcosis and general anesthesia. Concentrations of 3.6to 6.5 volumes percent in air are anesthetic to humans; 7- to 10-percentconcentrations cause respiratory arrest, and concentrations greater than10 percent are fatal (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 259). Repeated workplace exposuresdeliberately induced to produce the so-called ``ether jag'' have causednarcosis, exhaustion, headache, dizziness, sleepiness, excitation, andother psychic disturbances (Hake and Rowe 1963a/Ex. 1-1152). In women,albuminuria and polycythemia may result (Browning 1965a/Ex. 1-1017). Repeatedexposure may cause skin desiccation; irritation of the mucous membranesand eyes occurs on contact with the liquid or after exposure to high concentrationsof the vapor (Hake and Rowe 1963a/Ex. 1-1152). Nelson and co-workers (1943/Ex.1-66) reported that workers began to experience nasal irritation at 200ppm (Nelson, Enge, Ross et al. 1943/Ex. 1-66). Henderson and Haggard (1943c,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 259) calculated that the amount of etherabsorbed by a man of average height at a concentration of 400 ppm wouldnot cause intoxication. Armor (1950, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.259) observed that exposure effects occur only at levels of 500 ppm andabove.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N2; Tr. pp. 3-86 and 3-89) did not concur with OSHA'sproposed limits and noted that some individuals may experience sensoryirritation upon exposure to these levels, as evidenced by the Nelson, Enge,Ross et al. (1943/Ex. 1-66) study. However, this finding was not supportedby Armor (1950, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 259). OSHA receivedno other comments on its proposed limits. The Agency concludes that bothof these limits are necessary to protect exposed workers against the significantrisk of narcosis and irritation potentially associated with excursionsabove the 8-hour TWA level, and OSHA is establishing PELs of 400 ppm asan 8-hour TWA and 500 ppm as a 15-minute STEL for ethyl ether in today'srule. The Agency has determined that irritation and narcosis caused byexcessive exposure to ethyl ether constitute material impairments of healthand functional capacity.<ITAG tagnum="71">ETHYL MERCAPTAN </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-08-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>SH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1165</ITAG>OSHA previously had a ceiling limit of 10 ppm for ethyl mercaptan. An 8-hourTWA limit of 0.5 ppm was proposed for this substance, based on the ACGIH(1986/Ex. 1-3) recommendation; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred withOSHA's proposal. The final rule establishes a PEL of 0.5 ppm as an 8-hourTWA for ethyl mercaptan. Ethyl mercaptan is a colorless liquid with a persistentand penetrating leek-like odor. Acute animal toxicity data concerning ethyl mercaptan are taken from asingle study that reports the following findings. The 4-hour inhalationLC<T2>50</T2> values in rats and mice are 2770 ppm and 4420 ppm, respectively.In the rat, the intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> is reported to be approximately 450 mg/kg. One drop appliedto rabbit eyes caused only slight irritation, but high concentrations ofvapor caused considerable irritation within 15 minutes. Maximal sublethalintraperitoneal doses have been reported to induce deep sedation, withhigher exposures causing restlessness, muscular incoordination, skeletalmuscular paralysis, cyanosis, respiratory depression, coma, and death.Although inhalation tests showed no noteworthy pathology in rats, intraperitonealinjection caused lymphatic infiltration of liver with occasional necrosis(Fairchild and Stokinger 1958/Ex. 1-415). In chronic inhalation studiesof rabbits, rats, and mice, a five-month exposure to 40 ppm caused minimalcardiovascular and other systemic effects (Blinova 1965/Ex. 1-603). Studies of human volunteers, exposed at 4 ppm for three hours daily for5 to 10 days, have reported adverse effects. At this level, all subjectsexperienced altered taste and olfactory reactions, periodic nausea, mucousmembrane irritation, and fatigue. Exposure to 0.4 ppm produced no unpleasantsymptoms (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 262). The Workers Institute for Safety and Health (WISH) (Ex. 116) was criticalof OSHA's proposal to establish an 8-hour TWA limit rather than a STELor ceiling for ethyl mercaptan. OSHA believes that the health evidenceon ethyl mercaptan shows that a 0.5 ppm TWA limit will be sufficient toreduce the adverse acute effects associated with exposure to this substance;for example, a 3-hour exposure to 4 ppm, which caused adverse acute effectsin human volunteers (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 262), would exceed 0.5 ppmas an 8-hour TWA. The health evidence discussed above demonstrates that,at the previous PEL of 10 ppm (ceiling), employees were at risk of nausea,fatigue, and irritation; these effects have been demonstrated to occuron exposure to 4-ppm concentrations of this substance for just a few days.OSHA considers these exposure-related effects of nausea, fatigue, and irritationto be material impairments of health. The Agency concludes that the revisedlimit of 0.5 ppm will substantially reduce this significant risk. Therefore,OSHA is lowering its limit for ethyl mercaptan to 0.5 ppm as an 8-hourTWA. <ITAG tagnum="71">ETHYLENE GLYCOL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-21-1; Chemical Forumla: CH<T2>2</T2>OHCH<T2>2</T2>OH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1169 </ITAG>OSHA previously had no limit for ethylene glycol and proposed a ceilinglimit of 50 ppm (approximately 125 mg/m3) for this clear, colorless, odorless,hygroscopic liquid. The final rule establishes a limit of 50 ppm as a ceiling,which is consistent with the limit recommended by the ACGIH for ethyleneglycol. Ethylene glycol poses virtually no exposure risk at room temperaturebecause of its low vapor pressure; at elevated temperatures, however, exposuresare possible and adverse effects have been reported as a result of exposureto mists. In studies of rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys, Coon and colleagues(1970/Ex. 1-84) reported that animals exposed over a 30-day period to concentrationsof 10 or 57 mg/m3 for eight hours daily, five days per week, showed noadverse effects. Moderate to severe eye irritation did occur in rats andrabbits exposed at 12 mg/m3 for 24 hours per day for 90 days (Coon, Jones,Jenkins, and Siegel 1970/Ex. 1-84). Wiley and co-workers (1936/Ex. 1-600)reported no ill effects in animals exposed to approximately 350 to 400mg/m3, eight hours per day, for 16 weeks (Wiley, Hueper, and von Oettingen1936/Ex. 1-600). Rowe (1963/Ex. 1-865) concluded that daily exposure to 100 ppm of the vapordid not cause systemic or eye injuries, although Troisi (1949/Ex. 1-598)described nystagmus in overexposed workers (concentrations not reported).In a human inhalation study, Wills and colleagues (1974/Ex. 1-582) reportedthat volunteers exposed to the aerosol from 20 to 22 hours per day forfour weeks, at an average concentration of 12 ppm, complained of throatirritation, mild headache, and lower back pain. Complaints were more pronouncedwhen the concentration was raised to 140 mg/m3 (50 ppm) for part of a day.Average concentrations of 80 ppm were found intolerable by the subjects,who reported a burning sensation in the throat and respiratory passages;irritation was also common at 60 ppm (Wills, Coulston, Harris et al. 1974/Ex.1-582). Based primarily on this study, NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, p. 6; Tr. p. 3-86)suggested that OSHA reconsider its proposed 50-ppm ceiling limit; however,NIOSH acknowledged that the exposure concentrations used by Wills et al.(1974/Ex. 1-582) were ``significantly erratic.'' NIOSH also described recentevidence that ethylene glycol may be a potential teratogen. OSHA will continueto monitor the toxicologic literature on this substance to evaluate ethyleneglycol's potential teratogenicity. Gary L. Melampy, counsel for the Independent Lubricant Manufacturers Association(ILMA) (Ex. 3-830), commented that OSHA should apply the 50-ppm ceilinglimit only to those workplaces where ethylene glycol is used at elevatedtemperatures. In the final rule, OSHA has not restricted the applicationof any new or revised PEL to a particular industry segment or industrialprocess. OSHA recognizes that industrial processes vary in characteristicsthat affect the degree of risk to which workers are exposed; these characteristicsinclude the amount of material processed or handled, the frequency withwhich a substance is present, the extent to which a process is open orclosed, and the temperatures and pressures at which materials are used.OSHA's policy, which is reflected in all of its previous health standards,has been to base its permissible exposure limits on scientific evidencethat exposure to a substance at a given concentration or dose is associatedwith a health risk and that promulgating a PEL will reduce that risk. Thus,a relationship between exposure level and degree of risk is establishedand is deemed applicable in all situations where a substance is present.If the characteristics of a process are such that employee exposure toa substance is nonexistent or is well below the levels associated witha health risk, the promulgation of a limit on employee exposure will havelittle or no effect on the operation or process and imposes no additionalburden on the employer. Therefore, in the specific case of ethylene glycol,OSHA sees no reason to limit application of the 50-ppm ceiling limit tothose processes where exposure to airborne ethylene glycol is most likely.Based on evidence of an occupational risk of severe throat and respiratoryirritation associated with exposure to the vapor and mist, OSHA is promulgatinga ceiling limit of 50 ppm for ethylene glycol; this level is just belowthe level at which clinical symptoms have been noted in humans. OSHA considersthese symptoms, which include throat and respiratory irritation and headache,to be material impairments of health. The Agency concludes that this limitwill substantially reduce the significant risk associated with exposuresto higher levels that would be permitted in the absence of a PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">ETHYLIDENE NORBORNENE  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 16219-75-3; Chemical Formula: C<T2>9</T2>H<T2>12</T2>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1171</ITAG>OSHA had no previous limit for ethylidene norbornene. The Agency proposeda ceiling limit of 5 ppm, based on the ACGIH recommendation, and is establishingthis limit in the final rule. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) agreed with theselection of this limit. Ethylidene norbornene is a colorless liquid whichreacts with oxygen.  In a range-finding study, five of six rats died following a 4-hour exposureto 4000 ppm 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (Smyth, Carpenter, Weil et al. 1969/Ex.1-442). Other studies of longer duration have reported that exposures to237 ppm for seven hours per day, five days per week, for 88 days resultedin death for 21 of 24 rats. No deaths resulted from repeated exposuresat 90 ppm, but renal lesions and enlarged livers were observed; liver lesions,testicular atrophy, and hydrothorax occurred only at the 237-ppm level(Kinkead, Pozzani, Geary, and Carpenter 1971/Ex. 1-606). Beagle dogs similarlyexposed to 93 ppm for 89 days survived but exhibited such effects as testicularatrophy, hepatic lesions, and slight blood changes. Less pronounced effectswere seen after exposures to 61 ppm, and no effects were seen at 22 ppm(Kinkead, Pozzani, Geary, and Carpenter 1971/Ex. 1-606).  Human volunteers exposed for 30 minutes to ethylidene norbornene concentrationsof 11 ppm experienced eye and nose irritation; at 6 ppm, transient eyeirritation occurred (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 261). Other than the commentsubmitted by NIOSH, OSHA receive no comments on its proposal to establisha ceiling limit of 5 ppm for ethylidene norbornene.  In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 5-ppm ceiling for this substance.The Agency finds that this limit is necessary to minimize the risk of irritationthat has been documented to occur in occupational exposures to concentrationsas low as 6 ppm for 30-minute periods. OSHA has determined that the eyeand nasal irritation associated with exposure to ethylidene norborneneconstitute material impairments of health. The Agency concludes that thislimit will reduce this risk substantially.  <ITAG tagnum="71">FURFURAL  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 98-01-0; Chemical Formula: C<T2>5</T2>H<T2>4</T2>O<T2>2</T2>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The Agency proposed reducing this limit to 2ppm TWA and retaining the skin notation, based on the ACGIH recommendation;these limits are established in the final rule. Furfural is a colorless,oily liquid that turns rust-colored when exposed to air and light.  An inhalation exposure to 260 ppm of furfural was fatal to rats but notto mice or rabbits. A four-week exposure of dogs to 130 ppm for six hoursa day caused liver damage, but no adverse effects were observed at 63 ppm(AIHA 1965, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 280).  Bugyi and Lepoid (1949/Ex. 1-1077) described numbness of the tongue andoral mucosa, absence of a sence of taste, and labored breathing in workersexposed to furfural (at unspecified levels) in a poorly ventilated facility.Korenman and Resnik (1930, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 280) statedthat inhalations of from 1.9 to 14 ppm furfural caused headaches, itchingthroat, and eye irritation; Kuhn (1944/Ex. 1-883) reported that exposureto furfural damages the eyesight in some individuals. NIOSH (1975e/Ex.1-1183) described widespread eye and respiratory tract irritation in workersat a grinding wheel plant exposed to furfural vapor at levels ranging from5 to 16 ppm. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N2; Tr. p. 3-86) did not concur withthe proposed limit on the basis of these findings and, in addition, urgedthe Agency to follow up on a recent NTP assay with regard to a possiblecarcinogenic response in animals exposed to furfural. OSHA notes that Dunlopand Peters (1953/Ex. 1-1189) report that a 15-year study of furfural usein the synthetic resin industry revealed that this substance is not hazardousto employee health in facilities that are adequately ventilated, and thatonly occasional individual sensitivity was found. The Agency will carefullymonitor the results of the NTP Study, currently in peer review, as wellas any other scientific evidence pertaining to the health effects of furfural.NIOSH was the only commenter on this substance in the rulemaking record. After reviewing the evidence above, OSHA concludes that its former 5-ppmlimit is not sufficient to protect workers from eye and respiratory tractirritation; this is evidenced by the NIOSH study (1975e/Ex. 1-1183), inwhich widespread irritation was reported to occur among workers esposedto 5 to 16 ppm. OSHA considers the eye and respiratory tract irritationcaused by exposure to furfural to be material impairment of health. Therefore,to protect workers from eye and respiratory tract irritation, OSHA is revisingits limit for furfural to 2 ppm as an 8-hour TWA; this limit is establishedin today's rule. OSHA is also retaining its skin notation; Sax and Lewis<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials,</T3> 7th ed., 1989) reportedthe dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits to be 620 mg/kg, indicating that furfural penetratesthe skin and can cause systemic effects.  <ITAG tagnum="71">FURFURAL ALCOHOL  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 98-00-0; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>6</T2>O<T2>2</T2>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1184</ITAG>OSHA's previous limit for furfuryl alcohol was 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.In the NPRM, OSHA proposed revising its limit to 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWAand 15 ppm as a 15-minute STEL, and adding a skin notation, based on theACGIH recommendation. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal,and these limits are established in the final rule. Furfuryl alcohol isa colorless liquid which turns red or brown on exposure to light and air.The bases for the proposed OSHA limits, which were derived from ACGIH-recommendedlimits, are two foundry studies in which furfuryl alcohol was releasedduring core preparation. Apol (1973/Ex. 1-1180) reported no discomfortamong workers exposed to 10.8 ppm furfuryl alcohol, but severe lacrimationoccurred at 15.8 ppm. Formaldehyde was also present at a concentrationof 0.33 ppm. Burton and Rivera (1972/Ex. 1-944) found no irritation, headache,or dizziness among workers exposed to 8-hour TWA concentrations of 5 and6 ppm, with excursions up to 16 ppm. In its criteria document, NIOSH (1979a/Ex. 1-236) also reviewed these studiesbut concluded that it was unknown whether the lacrimation reported by Apol(1973/Ex. 1-1180) was caused by furfuryl alcohol, formaldehyde, or bothcombined. NIOSH also noted that the current OSHA limit (50 ppm) is fivetimes lower than the concentration reported to cause no adverse effectsin monkeys (Woods and Seevers 1954-1956, as cited in NIOSH 1979a/Ex. 1-236).At the time, NIOSH (1979a/Ex. 1-236) recommended that the 50-ppm limitshould remain, since no information existed that showed that this limitoffered inadequate protection.Mr. H.K. Thompson, Corporate Industrial Hygiene Manager of Caterpillar,Inc. (Ex. 3-349), commented that formaldehyde probably contributed morethan furfuryl alcohol to the lacrimation observed by Apol (1973/Ex. 1-1180).He also agreed that the 50-ppm PEL was too high, since his personal experiencehas indicated that eye irritation occurs between 25 and 30 ppm furfurylalcohol. Mr. Thompson recommended that OSHA revise its limit to 25 ppmTWA and add a 50 ppm STEL.In its final rule for formaldehyde, OSHA analyzed extensively the dose-responsedata on formaldehyde's irritant effects. In that analysis, OSHA concludedthat severe irritation and lacrimation occur in most individuals when theformaldehyde levels reach 3 ppm or above; at levels between 0.1 and 0.5ppm, slight eye irritation may occur in some individuals (52 FR 46235).In the foundry study by Apol (1973/Ex. 1-1180), formaldehyde was presentat a concentration of 0.33 ppm, about 10 times below the level associatedwith severe eye irritation. Therefore, OSHA believes that exposure to furfurylalcohol levels of about 16 ppm was most likely the cause of the lacrimationreported by Apol (1973/Ex. 1-1180).NIOSH (Ex. 150, Comments on Furfuryl Alcohol) concurred with OSHA's proposalto revise the limits for this substance to 10-ppm TWA and 15-ppm STEL.In its posthearing submission, NIOSH cited a study by Cockcroft et al.(1980, as cited in Ex. 150), who reported that a 50-year-old moldmakerdeveloped asthma after working with a mixture containing furfuryl alcohol,paraformaldehyde, xylene, and a catalyst containing sulfuric acid, phosphoricacid, and butyl alcohol. The patient's bronchial response to inhaled histamineswas two to three times more severe following exposure to furfuryl alcoholmixed with butyl alcohol.OSHA finds that the additional evidence submitted by NIOSH further justifiesthe proposed limits. This evidence indicates that exposure to furfurylalcohol may potentiate asthmatic responses that are suggestive of an allergicor hypersensitive condition. Individuals that are so affected frequentlyrespond adversely to exposure levels below those that affect most otherpersons, and the asthmatic response is much more severe than that of respiratorytract irritation.Therefore, OSHA concludes that the Apol (1973/Ex. 1-1180) study shows thatsevere eye irritation is associated with exposure to about 16 ppm furfurylalcohol, and that furfuryl alcohol is capable of inducing more seriousasthmatic responses in at least some workers. OSHA has determined thatthe severe eye irritation and asthma caused by exposure to furfuryl alcoholrepresent material impairments of health and functional capacity. The Agencyis establishing PELs for this substance of 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and15 ppm as a 15-minute STEL, with a skin notation, to reduce these significantrisks among exposed employees. The skin notation is added to alert employersthat excessive exposure may result from dermal contact; according to Proctor,Hughes, and Fischman (1988, p. 263), furfuryl alcohol is readily absorbedthrough the skin of animals in sufficient quantity to be lethal.<ITAG tagnum="71">GLUTARALDEHYDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 111-30-8; Chemical Formula: OCH (CH<T2>2</T2>)<T2>3</T2>CHO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1187</ITAG>OSHA previously had no limit for glutaraldehyde and proposed establishinga ceiling limit of 0.2 ppm, based on the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) recommendation.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal, and the finalrule establishes this limit. Glutaraldehyde is an aliphatic dialdehydethat forms colorless crystals.Glutaraldehyde is strongly irritating to the nose, eyes, and skin (<T3>Human Sensory Irritation Threshold of Glutaraldehyde Vapor </T3>1976,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 285) and can cause allergic contactdermatitis from occasional or incidental occupational exposure (Jordan,Dahl, and Albert 1972/Ex. 1-1056). The rat oral LD<T2>50</T2> has been variously reported as 250, 820, and 2380 mg/kg (Stonehill,Krop, and Borick 1963/Ex. 1-1066; Smyth 1963 and NIOSH 1975f, both as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 285). The dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in the rabbit is 2560 mg/kg, and the 4-hour inhalation LD<T2>50</T2> in the rat is 5000 ppm (NIOSH 1975f, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 285).Mice exposed to alkalinized glutaraldehyde at 8 and 33 ppm for 24 hourshave shown marked nervous behavior with panting and compulsive washingof the face and limbs; those exposed to 33 ppm exhibited signs of toxichepatitis at autopsy (Varpela, Otterstrom, and Hackman 1971/Ex. 1-1072).In a study of a cold-sterilizing operation in which the operator was exposedfor 12 minutes to an activated 2-percent aqueous solution, a measurementof 0.38 ppm glutaraldehyde was taken in the operator's breathing zone;the operator and the investigators experienced severe eye, nose, and throatirritation as well as sudden headache at the end of this procedure (Schneiderand Blejer 1973, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 285). Another studyemploying very precise methods of airborne concentration measurement reportedthe irritation response level for glutaraldehyde to be 0.3 ppm and theodor recognition threshold to be 0.04 ppm (Colwell 1976, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 285).Other than the NIOSH submission, OSHA received no comments on its proposalto establish a ceiling level of 0.2 ppm for glutaraldehyde. The Agencyfinds that the human evidence cited above clearly demonstrates a significantrisk of irritation to the eyes nose, and throat associated with short-termexposures to glutaraldehyde at concentrations of 0.3 ppm or above. OSHAconsiders the irritation effects associated with exposure to glutaraldehydeto be material impairments of health. Therefore, OSHA is establishing a0.2 ppm ceiling limit for this substance in the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="71">HEXACHLOROCYCLOPENTADIENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 77-47-4; Chemical Formula: C<T2>5</T2>C1<T2>6</T2>.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1196</ITAG>No previous OSHA limit existed for hexachlorocyclopentadiene. The Agencyproposed to establish a 0.01-ppm 8-hour TWA limit for this substances,based on the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) recommendation; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) concurred with this proposal, and the final rule adds this limit tothe Z table. Hexachlorocyclopentadiene is a yellow to amber-colored, nonflammableliquid with a pungent odor.Hexachlorocyclopentadiene has a high order of acute toxicity in laboratoryanimals. Rabbits, mice, rats, and guinea pigs died from inhaling 89.5 percentof the vapor in air (Treon, Cleveland, and Cappel 1955/Ex. 1-497). In 150daily exposures of seven hours each, rabbits, rats, and guinea pigs survivedconcentrations of 0.15 ppm, but a similar exposure was fatal to four offive mice. At approximately twice this concentration, mice, rats, and mostrabbits died by or before the 25th exposure, but guinea pigs survived 30exposures. The hexachlorocyclopentadiene vapors caused tearing, laboredrespiration, and, at high concentrations, tremors. Treon and associates(1955/Ex. 1-497) observed degenerative changes in the brain, heart, liver,adrenal glands, and kidneys, and pulmonary irritation occurred in all species,even at the lowest concentration of 0.15 ppm. At higher concentrations,pulmonary edema, hyperemia, necrotizing bronchitis, and bronchiolitis wereobserved (Treon, Cleveland, and Cappel 1955/Ex. 1-497).In humans, there are few data concerning hexachlorocyclopentadiene's toxicity.Irritation is known to occur, but the intolerable odor and eye irritationassociated with exposure to this substance have discouraged prolonged exposures(McGilvray 1971, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 300).The New Jersey Department of Public Health (Exs. 144, 144A) urged OSHAto establish a PEL for hexachlorocyclopentadiene on the basis of EPA'sIRIS data. The use of this approach is discussed in section VI.A of thepreamble.The proposed TWA PEL of 0.01 ppm for this severly toxic substance is about10 times below the level associated with systemic damage and pulmonaryirritation in experimental animals. In the absence of any limit on exposure,OSHA finds that employees are at significant risk of intense eye and pulmonaryirritation and multiple organ damage; the Agency considers these effectsto be material impairments of health and functional capacity. To substantiallyreduce these risks, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.01 ppmfor hexachlorocyclopentadiene.<ITAG tagnum="71">HEXYLENE GLYCOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-41-5; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2>-COHCH<T2>2</T2>-CHOH-CH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1204</ITAG>OSHA previously had no limit for hexylene glycol. Based on the ACGIH recommendation,OSHA proposed a ceiling limit of 25 ppm for this liquid, which has a mild,sweetish odor. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposedlimit, and the final rule establishes it.In mice, the LD<T2>50</T2> for hexylene glycol is reported to be 3.8 ml/kg, and it isreported to be 4.79 g/kg in rats. A single dose of 2.0 ml/kg induced hypnosisin mice. Undiluted hexylene glycol instilled into the rabbit eye causedirritation and corneal injury (Smyth and Carpenter 1948/Ex. 1-375).The Shell Chemical Corporation has reported that oral administration ofhexylene glycol can cause nervous system depression that is manifestedby an initial state of excitation, followed by deep depression (Shell ChemicalCorporation, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 309). When the liquid isapplied to the skin, mild to moderate irritation occurs, although skinabsorption does not. At high concentrations, hexylene glycol vapors evokea strong sensory response: a five-minute exposure at 1000 ppm producedeye irritation and throat and respiratory discomfort. At concentrationsof 50 ppm for 15 minutes, slight eye irritation was reported (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 309).Mr. Melampy, Counsel to the ILMA, commented that the proposed 25-ppm ceilinglimit ``is far below the hazard levels found to exist . . . ,'' given thatexposures to hexylene glycol concentrations of 50 ppm for brief periodsof time cause only slight eye irritation. OSHA does not agree with theassessment that a 25-ppm ceiling limit is too low. As discussed earlierin this section, OSHA has determined that no employee should be subjectedto mucous membrane or respiratory irritation caused by exposure to toxicagents and that this effect represents material impairment of health andadversely affects the well-being and functional capacity of employees.For hexylene glycol, 50 ppm represents an adverse-effect level, and establishingthe limit at this level would not be sufficiently protective. OSHA alsoconcludes that 25 ppm is a reasonable level at which to establish the PEL;this level provides some margin against this substance's irritant effects.Therefore, OSHA finds that establishing a 25-ppm ceiling limit for hexyleneglycol is necessary to reduce the risks of eye and respiratory irritation,which occur at exposure levels above the new PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">HYDROGEN BROMIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 10035-10-6; Chemical Formula: HBr</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1206</ITAG>The previous OSHA PEL for hydrogen bromide was 3 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.The Agency proposed revising this limit to 3 ppm as a ceiling limit notto be exceeded at any time during the working day; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) concurred with this proposal. In the final rule, OSHA is establishingthis ceiling limit, which conforms to the recommendation made by the ACGIH.Hydrogen bromide (HBr) is a colorless, corrosive, nonflammable gas withan acrid odor.Animal studies have demonstrated that hydrogen bromide has a considerablyhigher acute toxicity than hydrogen chloride (HC1) in mice and a somewhathigher acute toxicity than this chemical in rats (NIOSH 1977i/Ex. 1-1182).In mice, the LC<T2>50</T2> is 800 ppm HBr in air for 60 minutes (and 2500 ppm HC1 in airfor 30 minutes); in rats, the LC<T2>50</T2> is 2800 ppm HBr in air for 60 minutes (and 5000 ppm HC1 inair for 30 minutes).The chief toxic effect of hydrogen bromide in humans is primary irritationof the nose and throat. Irritation begins within several minutes at levelsof between 3 and 6 ppm. At 2 ppm, the odor of HBr is detectable, but noirritation is experienced (Connecticut State Department of Health 1955,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 312). No chronic effects have been associatedwith exposure to hydrogen bromide. No comments, other than NIOSH's, werereceived on this substance.OSHA finds that, under its previous 3-ppm TWA limit, workers were at significantrisk of experiencing irritant effects due to short-term exposures to levelsof hydrogen bromide exceeding 3 ppm. The Agency considers the irritanteffects of exposure to hydrogen bromide to be material impairments of health.Therefore, OSHA is establishing a 3-ppm ceiling limit for this substancein the final rule to limit short-term exposures to hydrogen bromide andreduce this risk.<ITAG tagnum="71">HYDROGEN FLUORIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7664-39-3; Chemical Formula: HF</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1208</ITAG>The previous OSHA standard for hydrogen fluoride was 3 ppm as an 8-hourTWA. OSHA proposed supplementing its 3-ppm TWA with a 15-minute STEL of6 ppm. These limits are established in the final rule and are the sameas those recommended by NIOSH (1976f, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p.315). In its posthearing comments, NIOSH (Ex. 150, Comments on HydrogenFluoride) concurred with OSHA's proposed limits for hydrogen fluoride.The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) recommends a 3 ppm TLV-ceiling for hydrogen fluoride.Hydrogen fluoride is a fuming, colorless liquid; at temperatures above19 anddegrees;C (66 anddegrees;F), it becomes a colorless gas.Guinea pigs and rabbits survived 40-ppm hydrogen fluoride concentrationsfor 41 hours, but exposure to 300 ppm for two hours or more was fatal (Machle,Thamann, Kitzmiller, and Cholak 1934/Ex. 1-519). Animals exposed to 3 ppmhydrogen fluoride for 30 days showed no adverse effects (Ronzani 1909,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 315). Stokinger (1949a, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 315) reported that animals repeatedly exposed to7 ppm on a daily basis exhibited mild respiratory tract irritation. Onestudy by Largent (1961/Ex. 1-1158) demonstrated kidney, liver, and lungdamage in laboratory animals repeatedly exposed to 17 ppm hydrogen fluoride.At 8.6 ppm, the pathologic changes seen in exposed animals were minor,except for lung damage in one dog (Largent 1961/Ex. 1-1158). In studies with humans, Largent (1960/Ex. 1-516; 1961/Ex. 1-1158) reportedthat volunteers exposed repeatedly to concentrations of hydrogen fluorideas high as 4.7 ppm for six hours/day for 10 to 50 days experienced irritationand burning of the eyes and nose, in addition to reddening of the skin,at concentrations above 3 ppm. Industrial experience has shown that directcontact of the skin with hydrogen fluoride results in severe burns thatmay have a delayed onset but later develop into ulcers that eventuallyscar (Stokinger 1981b/Ex. 1-1127). A report by Eagers (1969, as cited inStokinger 1981b, above) described several industrial accidents in whichworkers died in a matter of hours after accidental splashing from rupturedcontainers of hydrogen fluoride (the cause of death was respiratory failureand cardiac arrest). Kleinfeld (1965/Ex. 1-514) reported a fatal case ofhydrogen fluoride poisoning that caused death from pulmonary edema.NIOSH (1976f, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 315), in its criteriadocument, cites numerous studies that consistently show that long-termoccupational exposures to hydrogen fluoride lead to fluorosis in workers.The NIOSH limit is based in part on a study by Derryberry, Bartholomew,and Fleming (1963/Ex. 1-506) showing that the threshold limit for minimalincreases in bone density caused by fluoride (fluorosis) is below 4.3 ppmof hydrogen fluoride. The limits proposed by OSHA are the current NIOSH-recommendedlimits for this substance, and NIOSH's concurrence statement was the onlycomment received in the record.Because of hydrogen fluoride's potential to cause respiratory irritation,OSHA finds that a STEL is necessary to reduce the risk associated withelevated, short-term exposures, which would be permitted under the 3 ppmTWA limit alone. The Agency has determined that the irritation caused byexposure to hydrogen fluoride constitutes a material impairment of health.Therefore, OSHA is revising the limits for hydrogen fluoride to 3 ppm asan 8-hour TWA and 6 ppm as a 15-minute STEL; these limits are establishedin the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="71">2-HYDROXYPROPYL ACRYLATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 999-61-1; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>CHCOOCH<T2>2</T2>CHOHCH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1211</ITAG>OSHA previously had no limit for 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate. A limit of 0.5ppm as an 8-hour TWA, with a skin notation, was proposed, based on theACGIH recommendation. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with the proposal,and this limit is established in the final rule. 2-Hydroxypropyl acrylate(HPA) is a colorless liquid at room temperature. In experimental animals, 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate has a high acute toxicity.The Dow Chemical Company (1977c, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 320)has reported an oral LD<T2>50</T2> for the rat of 0.25 to 0.5 g/kg, and a dermal LD<T2>50</T2> for the rabbit approximately 0.25 mg/kg. In guinea pigs, directcontact with HPA caused severe eye burns and skin corrosion and sensitizedsome of the experimental animals. Rats exposed to a concentration of 650ppm HPA in air for seven hours survived. Longer-term inhalation studies(30 days for two hours/day, six days/week) in rats, dogs, rabbits, andmice resulted in some irritation at 5 ppm (Dow Chemical Company 1977c,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 320). OSHA received no comment (other than NIOSH's) on its proposed 0.5-ppm TWAlimit and skin notation for this substance. The Agency finds that thislimit is necessary to protect workers from the risks of irritant effects,skin and eye burns, and sensitization effects associated with exposureto 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate; OSHA considers these effects material impairmentsof health. Therefore, OSHA is promulgating a TWA limit of 0.5 ppm, whichis below the effect level for irritation found in experimental animals.OSHA is also adding a skin notation to the limit because 2-hydroxypropylacetate readily penetrates the skin to cause systemic effects; the dermalLD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits has been reported to be 0.25 mg/kg (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3).<ITAG tagnum="71">IRON SALTS (SOLUBLE)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: Varies with compound; Chemical Formula: Varies with compound</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1217</ITAG>OSHA previously had no limit for the soluble iron salts and proposed establishingthe ACGIH-recommended limit of 1 mg/m3, measured as iron, for these substances.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with OSHA's proposed limit for thesoluble salts of iron, and the final rule establishes an 8-hour TWA PELof 1 mg/m3. When injected into the bloodstream of experimental animals, iron salts(especially the ferric salts) are highly toxic (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.328). The acute intravenous dose of ferric chloride that is lethal to rabbitsis about 7.2 mg/kg (Drinker, Warren, and Page 1935/Ex. 1-315). The ACGIH(1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 328) considers the salts to be irritants to the respiratorytract when inhaled as dusts and mists. Stewart and Faulds (1934/Ex. 1-764)described the ferric salts as skin irritants. The oral toxicities of ironsalts are considered to be moderate to low, although marked gastrointestinalirritation results from ingestion (U.S. Department of Labor 1941, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 328); 30 grams is the estimated fatal dose forhumans (Smyth 1956/Ex. 1-759). NIOSH was the only commenter on OSHA's proposed 8-hour TWA PEL of 1 mg/m3,measured as iron, for the soluble salts of iron. The Agency concludes that,in the absence of any limit, employees are at risk of skin and mucous membraneirritation associated with exposure to high concentrations of these salts.OSHA considers these effects to be material impairments of health and deemsthis risk to be significant. Therefore, OSHA is establishing a 1 mg/m38-hour TWA PEL for the soluble iron salts. <ITAG tagnum="71">ISOPROPYL ACETATE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-21-4; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>COOCH(CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

TheAgency proposed supplementing this limit with a 15-minute STEL of 310 ppm,based on the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) recommendation. OSHA is establishingthese limits for this substance in the final rule. Isopropyl acetate isa colorless liquid and has a fruity odor. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> for rats is reported to be 6.75 g/kg; five of six rats diedafter a four-hour exposure to 32,000 ppm, and one of six rats died aftera four-hour exposure to 16,000 ppm (Smyth, Carpenter, Weil, and Pozzani1954/Ex. 1-400). The primary problems in occupational exposures to isopropyl acetate areeye and mucous membrane irritation. In humans, exposure to 200 ppm isopropylacetate for 15 minutes caused eye irritation, with nose and throat irritationoccurring at higher concentrations (Silverman, Schulte, and First 1946/Ex.1-142). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N2) notes that the majority of subjectsexposed to 200 ppm in the Silverman, Schulte, and First (1946/Ex. 1-142)study experienced eye irritation and that the authors of this study recommendedan 8-hour TWA of 100 ppm to prevent sensory irritation. OSHA agrees withNIOSH that this substance presents a hazard at elevated short-term levelsand has accordingly added a STEL to ensure that worker exposures are maintainedunder good industrial hygiene control. OSHA concludes that, in the absence of a short-term limit on exposure,the 250-ppm TWA limit alone will not protect employees from experiencingthe irritant effects associated with elevated short-term exposures to isporopylacetate. OSHA has determined that the irritant effects related to exposureto isopropyl acetate are material impairments of health. Therefore, toreduce the risk of irritation among exposed employees, the Agency is establishinga 250-ppm 8-hour TWA limit and a 310 ppm STEL for this substance.<ITAG tagnum="71">ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 67-63-0; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CHOHCH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

OSHA proposedadding a 15-minute STEL of 500 ppm to this TWA, based on the ACGIH recommendation,and the final rule establishes these limits. In its posthearing comment,NIOSH (Ex. 150, Comments on Isopropyl Alcohol) endorsed OSHA's proposal,stating that a STEL is necessary to reduce the risks of irritation andnarcosis that can occur on short-term exposure to elevated concentrationsof isopropyl alcohol. Isopropyl alcohol is a colorless, flammable liquidwith a slight odor resembling that of rubbing alcohol. Rats exposed at isopropyl alcohol concentrations of 12,000 ppm for fourhours survived, but extending the duration of exposure to eight hours killedthe animals (Smyth 1937-1955, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 337).Isopropyl alcohol has been demonstrated to be irritating to the eyes, nose,and throat in humans exposed for brief periods to 400 ppm (Nelson, Enge,Ross et al. 1943/Ex. 1-66); at 800 ppm, these symptoms were more intense.In addition, isopropyl alcohol has narcotic and irritative acute effectsat higher concentrations. Weil and associates have reported that an excessof paranasal sinus cancers has been observed among workers manufacturingisopropyl alcohol (Weil, Smith, and Nale 1952/Ex. 1-453). However, it hasbeen established that the cancers associated with isopropyl alcohol manufacturewere caused by isopropyl oil and not by the isopropyl alcohol itself (NIOSH1976g, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 337).No comments, other than NIOSH's, were received on this substance. The irritanteffects associated with exposure to isopropyl alcohol occur at concentrationsonly twice as high as the 8-hour TWA limit, even when the exposure lastsonly for a brief period; exposures at this level clearly cause irritation,as documented by the study by Nelson et al. (1943/Ex. 1-66).OSHA concludes that, in the absence of a STEL, workers are at significantrisk of experiencing the narcotic and irritative effects associated withshort-term exposures to isopropyl alcohol above the 8-hour TWA PEL of 400ppm. Therefore, the Agency is retaining its 400 ppm 8-hour TWA limit forisopropyl alcohol and adding a 500 ppm 15-minute STEL to substantiallyreduce this significant risk. OSHA has determined that the narcosis andeye and mucous membrane irritation associated with chronic and acute exposuresto isopropyl alcohol constitute material impairments of health and thata STEL is needed to protect workers from experiencing these harmful effects.<ITAG tagnum="71">n-ISOPROPYLAMINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-31-0; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2>CHNH<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1228</ITAG>OSHA's previous limit for n-isopropylamine was 5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.The Agency proposed retaining this TWA limit and adding a 10-ppm 15-minuteSTEL, based on the ACGIH recommendation. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1; Tr.p. 3-86) concurred with this proposal, and these limits are establishedin the final rule. This substance is a flammable, volatile, colorless liquidthat has an odor similar to that of ammonia.The most serious effect of n-isopropylamine in laboratory animals is respiratorytract irritation, which can be severe enough to cause lung edema (Smyth1956/Ex. 1-759). Rats survived a four-hour inhalation at 4000 ppm, butan 8000-ppm exposure resulted in fatalities (Smyth, Carpenter, and Weil1951/Ex. 1-439). Proctor and Hughes (1978/Ex. 1-1136) have reported thatthe odor of n-isopropylamine becomes strong and unpleasant at the 10- to20-ppm level; nose and throat irritation is experienced even as a resultof brief exposures.Except for NIOSH, no rulemaking participants commented on OSHA's proposalto issue a 5-ppm TWA and 15-minute STEL of 10 ppm for this substance. TheAgency concludes that both a TWA and STEL are required to protect exposedworkers from the significant risk of upper respiratory tract irritationthat is known to occur even at brief excursions above the 8-hour PEL. TheAgency considers upper respiratory tract irritation resulting from exposureto this substance to be a material impairment of health. Therefore, OSHAis revising the PEL for n-isopropylamine to 5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and10 ppm as a 15-minute STEL; these limits are established in the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="71">MESITYL OXIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 141-79-7; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2>C=CHCOCH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1243</ITAG>OSHA's previous limit for mesityl oxide was 25 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. TheAgency proposed revising this limit to 15 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 25 ppmas a 15-minute STEL, based on the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) recommendation.NIOSH has a 10-ppm REL for mesityl oxide. The final rule establishes a15-ppm 8-hour TWA and a 25-ppm 15-minute STEL for mesityl oxide, whichis an oily, colorless liquid with a peppermint odor.Silverman, Schulte, and First (1946/Ex. 1-142) found that a majority oftest subjects experienced eye irritation on exposure to 25 ppm mesityloxide and nasal irritation at 50 ppm. A toxicity data sheet published bythe Shell Chemical Corporation (1957, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.361) confirms 25 ppm as the maximum comfort level. Smyth, Seaton, and Fischer(1942/Ex. 1-378) reported liver and kidney damage among rats and guineapigs exposed to 100 ppm mesityl oxide for six weeks; no adverse effectswere reported for animals exposed to 50 ppm. After reviewing these data,the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 361) concluded that the former TLV of 25 ppmshould be reduced to 15 ppm TWA and 25 ppm as a 15-minute STEL becauseof the greater systemic toxicity of mesityl oxide compared with that ofother saturated ketones. NIOSH (1978f, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 361), relying on the same data, recommended a limit of 10 ppm as a 10-hourTWA.Studies indicate that eye irritation occurs following brief exposure to25 ppm of mesityl oxide, and nasal irritation is experienced at the 50-ppmlevel. Animal studies show liver and kidney damage in experimental animalsexposed to 100 ppm. NIOSH's comment (Ex. 8-47, Table N2; Tr. p. 3-86) wasthe only one received by the Agency on its proposal to revise the limitsfor mesityl oxide. NIOSH based its lower recommended limit on a beliefthat the eye irritation caused by exposure to mesityl oxide might be moresevere than the irritation caused by exposure to the other ketones becausemesityl oxide has a higher molecular weight than the lower ketones. OSHAis not persuaded by this argument because the evidence that brief exposureto 25 ppm mesityl oxide causes eye irritation is based on actual humanexposures to mesityl oxide at that level; that is, NIOSH's argument wouldbe reasonable if the 25 ppm short-term limit were being established byanalogy to the effects of another (lower-molecular-weight) ketone.After reviewing the health evidence for this substance, OSHA finds thatthe proposed 15-ppm TWA and 25-ppm STEL limits are protective against boththe acute and chronic effects demonstrated to be caused by exposure tothis substance. In the final rule, OSHA concludes that a TWA PEL of 15ppm and a STEL of 25 ppm are necessary to protect employees both from thepossible liver and kidney damage associated with chronic exposures andthe eye irritation resulting from elevated short-term exposures to mesityloxide. The Agency considers both the systemic and the irritant effectsof exposure to mesityl oxide material impairments of health and functionalcapacity. To reduce these risks, OSHA is establishing limits for mesityloxide of 15 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 25 ppm as a 15-minute STEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">METHYL 2-CYANOACRYLATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 137-05-3; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>=C(C=N)COOCH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1248</ITAG>No previous limit existed for methyl 2-cyanoacrylate. OSHA proposed establishinga limit of 2 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 4 ppm as a STEL, based on the ACGIHrecommendation, and the final rule establishes these limits. NIOSH (Ex.8-47, Table N1) concurred with the selection of these limits. Methyl 2-cyanoacrylateis a colorless, viscous liquid.In a personal communication to the ACGIH TLV Committee in 1985, EastmanKodak reported on the toxicity of methyl 2-cyanoacrylate in experimentalanimals. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is reported to be 1.6 to 3.2 g/kg, and the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in guinea pigs is 10 ml/kg. The adverse effects reported inlaboratory animals are slight irritation of the skin and corneal damage.An inhalation LC<T2>50</T2> of 101 ppm has been reported in rats exposed for six hoursto methyl 2-cyanoacrylate. Repeated exposures (six hours/day for five days/week)to 31.3 ppm for a total of 12 exposures caused only a slight decrease inthe rate of weight gain in rats and no nasal or tracheal lesions or systemictoxicity. No changes were observed in rats similarly exposed to 3.1 ppm(Eastman Kodak 1985, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 383).In a simulated workbench exposure, McGee and co-workers reported nasalirritation in humans at 3 ppm and eye irritation at 5 ppm (McGee, Oglesby,Raleigh, and Fassett 1968/Ex. 1-424). There are no reports of occupationalpoisonings. No comments, other than NIOSH's, were received on OSHA's proposedPELs for this substance.The report by McGee et al. (1968/Ex. 1-424) clearly establishes that employeesare at risk of nasal irritation on exposure to 3 ppm or above and of eyeirritation at 5 ppm or above. The Agency has determined that these adverseeffects constitute material impairment of health and should be avoidedin the workplace. Therefore, to substantially reduce these significantrisks, OSHA is establishing a 2-ppm 8-hour TWA limit and a 4-ppm STEL formethyl 2-cyanoacrylate in the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="71">METHYL ISOBUTYL CARBINOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-11-2; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CHOHCH<T2>2</T2>CH(CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1261</ITAG>OSHA previously had an 8-hour TWA limit of 25 ppm, with a skin notation,for methyl isobutyl carbinol. OSHA proposed supplementing these limitswith a STEL of 40 ppm, based on the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) recommended limits,and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal. The finalrule establishes a TWA limit of 25 ppm and a STEL of 40 ppm for this substance,with a skin notation. Methyl isobutyl carbinol is a colorless, stable liquid.In rabbits, a 24-hour skin applicatioin of 3.56 ml/kg (2.9 g/kg) was lethalto half the animals (Smyth, Carpenter, and Weil 1951/Ex. 1-439). Rats exposedby inhalation to 2000 ppm of methyl isobutyl carbinol vapor died, and thesame authors report that the oral LD<T2>50</T2> for rats is 2.6 g/kg (Smyth, Carpenter, and Weil 1951/Ex. 1-439).Humans volunteers exposed to methyl isobutyl carbinol reported eye irritationupon 15-minutes' exposure to 50 ppm (Silverman, Schulte, and First 1946/Ex.1-142). Other than NIOSH's, OSHA received no comments regarding the basisfor its proposed limits for methyl isobutyl carbinol.In view of the finding that exposure to 50 ppm can result in eye irritationin as little as 15 minutes, OSHA has determined that a risk of eye irritationexists in the absence of a limit on short-term exposure. The Agency considersthe eye irritation caused by exposure to this substance to be a materialimpairment of health. Therefore, to reduce this risk, OSHA is establishinga 15-minute STEL of 40 ppm, while retaining the 25-ppm 8-hour TWA PEL andskin notation for this substance.<ITAG tagnum="71">METHYL MERCAPTAN</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 74-93-1; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>SH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1263</ITAG>OSHA previously had a ceiling limit of 10 ppm for methyl mercaptan. Basedon the ACGIH recommendation, the Agency proposed revising this limit toan 8-hour TWA of 0.5 ppm, and OSHA is establishing this limit in the finalrule. Methyl mercaptan is a flammable, water-soluble gas with a disagreeableodor like that of rotten cabbage.Methyl mercaptan acts on the respiratory center, producing death by respiratoryparalysis. DeRekowski (1893, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 405) andFrankel (1927/Ex. 1-1033) have reported that the acute toxicity of methylmercaptan is similar to but somewhat lower than that of hydrogen sulfide;however, Ljunggren and Norberg (1943/Ex. 1-916) have concluded that thetwo substances exhibit toxicities of the same magnitude. Pulmonary edemaresults from exposures to lower, less acute concentrations of methyl mercaptan(Fairchild, personal communication, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.405).Inhalation of (an unspecified concentration of) methyl mercaptan producedcoma and death in one worker; acute hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemiadeveloped after this exposure (Schultz, Fountain, and Lynch 1970, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 405). A 1918 report by Pickler (as cited by E.E.Sandmeyer in Clayton and Clayton 1981) describes the accidental exposure(for several hours) of 28 students to a concentration of methyl mercaptanestimated at 4 ppm. The individuals had headache and nausea, and one studentshowed some liver involvement, demonstrated by the appearance of epithelialcells, protein, and erythrocytes, in the excretion fluid. This conditionsubsided in six weeks (Sandmeyer 1981).John L. Festa, Director of Chemical Control and Health Programs at theAmerican Paper Institute, Inc. (Ex. 3-685) objected to OSHA's proposalfor methyl mercaptan, stating that the basis for the ACGIH TLV, from whichthe OSHA proposal was derived, was not to reduce irritant effects but tolimit odor intensity. He commented further that regulating substances onthe basis of ``unpleasant sensory stimuli  . . . embarks upon a new precedent''(Ex. 3-685, p. 3). Mr. Festa reported that the odor of methyl mercaptanis relatively faint at 0.05 ppm, although the substance may be mildly irritatingover long periods of exposure to concentrations of 4 to 5 ppm.OSHA does not agree with the suggestion made by Mr. Festa that the effectsassociated with exposure to methyl mercaptan below 10 ppm (the previousOSHA limit) do not warrant attention. First, Mr. Festa acknowledges thatprolonged exposure to 4 to 5 ppm causes irritation; as discussed earlierin this section, OSHA has determined that sensory irritation constitutesmaterial impairment of health. Furthermore, a single inhalation exposureto 7.9 ppm has been reported to result in nauseating odor (NIOSH 1978b,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3 p. 405); clearly, this effect adverselyaffects the performance and functional capacity of employees. OSHA is alsoconcerned about the possible liver effects that were reported from a singleexposure to approximately 4 ppm methyl mercaptan (Pickler 1918, as citedby E.E. Sandmeyer in Clayton and Clayton 1981). Although this report isdated, OSHA has found no evidence that comprehensive studies have beenundertaken in humans to examine the potential for liver or other organdamage as a result of long-term exposure to low levels of methyl mercaptan.Liver and other organ defects have been reported to occur in animals exposedto 50 ppm for only 90 days. Because of these considerations, OSHA concludesthat a significant risk of acute sensory effects, as well as possible organdamage, exists at the former 10-ppm ceiling, and that a 0.5-ppm limit isnecessary to ensure that these significant risks are adequately reduced.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N7) recommends a ceiling limit at the same 0.5 ppmlevel. OSHA is revising its limit for methyl mercaptan to 0.5 ppm as an18-hour TWA, and this limit is promulgated in today's rule.<ITAG tagnum="71">METHYL n-AMYL KETONE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 110-43-0; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>COC<T2>5</T2>H<T2>11</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1264</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for methyl n-amyl ketone is 100 ppm TWA. OSHA didnot propose a revision to its current limit of 100 ppm, and this limitis being retained in the final rule. NIOSH (Ex. 150) agreed that the 100-ppmPEL was sufficiently protective.Johnson et al. (1978/Ex. 1-335) found no neurologic impairment in ratsand monkeys exposed to 131 ppm or 1025 ppm methyl n-amyl ketone for ninemonths. No gross or histopathologic changes were found (Johnson, Setzer,Lewis, and Hornung 1978/Ex. 1-335). Because of the absence of any humandata indicating the concentration of methyl n-amyl ketone that producessensory irritation, ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 374) believed it prudent toreduce the TLV-TWA from 100 ppm to 50 ppm. NIOSH (1978f, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 374) concluded that there was no basis for revising the100-ppm OSHA limit, since the evidence showed methyl n-amyl ketone's irritanteffects to be equivalent to those of 2-pentanone, which had a recommendedlimit of 150 ppm.No neurological or histopathological effects were observed at 131 ppm.The ACGIH's 50-ppm TLV applies an additional factor of safety to this no-observed-effectlevel, while the NIOSH REL is based on a judgment that such a reductionis unnecessary. In the NPRM, OSHA requested additional information on thehealth effects of methyl n-amyl ketone; however, no information was receivedinto the record.OSHA notes that the current 100-ppm PEL is well below the highest level(1025 ppm) reported to be associated with any adverse effects. Becausehistopathological examination was conducted on the organs of the rats andmonkeys tested, OSHA is confident that the existing 100-ppm limit is notlikely to be associated with adverse affects and that further reducingthis limit would not result in a substantial reduction in risk. Therefore,OSHA is not revising its 100-ppm TWA limit for methyl n-amyl ketone atthis time.<ITAG tagnum="71">alpha-METHYL STYRENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 98-83-9; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>C(CH<T2>3</T2>)=CH<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

(1956/Ex. 1-404). These data demonstratedthat seven-hour-per-day, five-day-per-week exposures to 200 ppm alpha-methylstyrene for six months produced no ill effects in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits,or monkeys.In humans, however, these authors reported that a two-minute exposure to200 ppm caused eye irritation and complaints about this substance's unpleasantodor. OSHA received no comments, other than NIOSH's, on its proposal torevise the limit for alpha-methyl styrene.Therefore, to ensure that workers are protected against the acute irritanteffects of this substance, OSHA is establishing a 50-ppm 8-hour TWA limitand a 100-ppm 15-minute STEL in the final rule. The Agency concludes thatthese combined limits will substantially reduce the exposure-related riskof irritation and odor effects, which together constitute material impairmentsof health.<ITAG tagnum="71">o-METHYLCYCLOHEXANONE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 583-60-8; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>C<T2>5</T2>H<T2>9</T2>CO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The Agency proposed revising this limit to 50ppm as a TWA and 75 ppm as a STEL, and to retain the skin notation; NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal. These limits are establishedin the final rule and are consistent with the limits recommended by theACGIH. ortho-Methylcyclohexanone is a somewhat viscous liquid with an acetone-likeodor.o-Methylcyclohexanone has both irritative and narcotic effects at relativelylow concentrations. The commercial product contains a mixture of isomers;however, toxicity data describe the effects of the ortho isomer only. Gross(as cited in Lehman and Flury 1943a/Ex. 1-962) reported that 450 ppm hadirritative effects on the eyes and respiratory systems of rabbits, and2500 ppm produced narcotic effects (Gross, as cited in Lehman and Flury1943a/Ex. 1-962). Treon et al. (1943a/Ex. 1-393) reported the oral LD<T2>50</T2> to be between 1 and 1.25 g/kg for rabbits. Eye problems wereobserved at about 500 ppm, but exposure to 182 ppm produced no adverseeffects (Treon, Crutchfield, and Kitzmiller 1943a/Ex. 1-393).Rowe and Wolf (1963, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 386) reported thatconcentrations of 100 ppm had no narcotic effects in humans but could causeirritation. No comments, other than NIOSH's, were received on OSHA's proposalto revise the limit for this substance.Because a level of 100 ppm may present an effect level for irritation inhumans (Rowe and Wolf 1963, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 386), OSHAfinds that a reduction in its 100-ppm PEL is warranted. The Agency considersthe irritation caused by exposure to this substance to be a material impairmentof health. Therefore, OSHA is revising its limit for o-methylcyclohexanoneto 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 75 ppm as a 15-minute STEL. OSHA is alsoretaining its skin notation for this substance.<ITAG tagnum="71">OSMIUM TETROXIDE  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 20816-12-0; Chemical Formula: OsO<T2>4</T2>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The final rule establishes theselimits for this substance. Osmium tetroxide is a noncombustible, colorlessto pale yellow solid with a disagreeable, chlorine-like odor.  Exposure to osmium tetroxide is known to produce ocular effects and respiratoryirritation. In 1933, Brunot (Ex. 1-776) reported that rabbits died frompulmonary edema four days after a 30-minute exposure to osmium tetroxideat 130 mg/m3 or higher. Visual problems (e.g., delayed lacrimation and``halo'' effects) were reported by this investigator after a brief exposureto osmium tetroxide at a significantly lower concentration (Brunot 1933/Ex.1-776). A four-hour LC<T2>50</T2> value of 40 ppm has been reported in rats and mice (NIOSH 1977i/Ex.1-1182). Toxic effects to bone marrow have been reported in guinea pigs(Hamilton and Hardy 1974a/Ex. 1-957).  Industrial experience indicates that concentrations in a precious metalrefining plant ranged from 0.1 to 0.6 mg/m3; intermittent exposures producedsymptoms (sometimes delayed) of lacrimation, vision disturbances, headache,conjunctivitis, and cough (McLaughlin, Milton, and Perry 1946/Ex. 1-749).Complaints of persistent and severe nose and throat irritation have beenreported (Hamilton and Hardy 1974a/Ex. 1-957). Fairhall (1949d, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 450) reported a human fatality resulting frominhalation exposure to OsO<T2>4</T2>. Flury and Zernik (1931i, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.450) reported that 0.001 mg/m3 is the highest concentration of osmium tetroxidethat can be tolerated for six hours without harmful effects.  Except for NIOSH, no rulemaking participants commented on the proposedaddition of a STEL for osmium tetroxide. The study by McLaughlin, Milton,and Perry (1946/Ex. 1-749) used a calibrated, calorimetric procedure, togetherwith well-described case reports, to assess the dose-response relationship.OSHA finds this study superior to the report by Flury and Zernik (1931i,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 450), which is more anecdotal. The McLaughlinet al. (1946/Ex. 1-749) study demonstrates serious, acute effects resultingfrom intermittent and short-term exposure. OSHA concludes that, in theabsence of a limit on short-term exposures, the 0.002-mg/m3 8-hour TWAPEL alone is not sufficient to protect employees from experiencing theseeffects, which are deemed to constitute material impairments of health.Therefore, to reduce the risk from short-term elevated exposures to osmiumtetroxide, OSHA is establishing a 15-minute STEL of 0.006 mg/m3 to supplementthe 0.002-mg/m3 TWA limit.  <ITAG tagnum="71">PARAFFIN WAX FUME  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 8002-74-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>n</T2>H<T2>2n+2</T2>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The final rule establishes this limit, which is the sameas the limit recommended by the ACGIH. Paraffin is a white or slightlyyellow, odorless solid that is derived from petroleum.  Paraffin is considered nontoxic in its solid state, but fume generatedwhen it is in the molten state may cause discomfort and nausea (Queriesand Minor Notes, <T3>JAMA</T3> 1938/Ex. 1-308). In the most recent report of industrialexposure effects, paraffin fume is reported to cause no discomfort in mostcases when the concentration is maintained at or below 2 mg/m3, althoughone instance of mild discomfort was reported at concentrations between0.6 and 1 mg/m3 (Massachusetts Division of Occupational Hygiene 1970, ascited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 455).  Dr. William Zeiler, President of the College of American Pathologists (Ex.3-976), objected to OSHA's inclusion of paraffin wax fume in the finalrule, stating that the scientific basis for the limit was lacking. Specifically,Dr. Zeiler commented that the <T3>JAMA</T3> article (1938/Ex. 1-308) reported ``vague and nonspecific''symptoms and that the reference from the Massachusetts Division of OccupationalHygiene was unpublished. He also reported that a literature search datingback to 1965 produced no references on the toxicology of paraffin wax fume.Dr. Zeiler expressed concern that, if a final limit is promulgated forparaffin wax fume, ``nonspecific complaints about the workplace environmentmay implicate this substance as the cause'' (Ex. 3-976).  OSHA is aware that the dose-response data for paraffin wax fume are dated;nevertheless, OSHA finds it notable that two different sources (cited byACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 455) report acute adverse effects associated withthe use of molten paraffin. OSHA also believes that promulgation of a PELfor paraffin wax fume will present little problem for pathology laboratories,since Dr. Zeiler commented that most clinical laboratories already complywith the ACGIH TLVs and that the services of certified industrial hygienistsare used when new laboratories are designed or old ones are remodeled.OSHA is more concerned about workplaces in which paraffin is used in largequantities, such as the food industry, and a greater degree of exposurecontrol is needed. To protect employees in these industries from experiencingacute adverse effects, such as discomfort and nausea, OSHA believes thata PEL for paraffin was fume is necessary. The Agency has determined thatthe adverse effects associated with excessive exposure to paraffin waxfume constitute material impairments of health. The limit of 2 mg/m3 hasbeen shown to be effective in reducing this risk (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.455); therefore, OSHA is establishing this limit for paraffin wax fume.<ITAG tagnum="71">PHOSPHORIC ACID</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7664-38-2; Chemical Formula: H<T2>3</T2>PO<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Phosphoric acid is a colorless, odorless solid at temperaturesbelow 21anddegrees;C but becomes a viscous, clear liquid at higher temperatures.In humans, there have been reports of respiratory irritation from exposureto phosphorus pentoxide fume at concentrations of between 3.6 and 11.3mg/m3; concentrations of 100 mg/m3 were unendurable except to workers whohad developed a tolerance to the fume over time (Rushing 1957, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 483). The AIHA Hygiene Guide for phosphoric acidreports that this substance is less hazardous than either nitric or sulfuricacid (AIHA 1957/Ex. 1-709). To protect unacclimatized workers from the risk of respiratory irritation,OSHA proposed a TWA limit of 1 mg/m3, with a STEL of 3 mg/m3, for phosphoricacid. No comments, other than NIOSH's, were received on this proposal.The Agency concludes that the combined 8-hour TWA and STEL limits are necessaryto reduce this significant risk of irritation, which is considered by OSHAto be material impairment of health and which has been shown to occur atlevels only slightly above those permitted by the TWA alone. Therefore,OSHA is establishing a 15-minute STEL of 3 mg/m3 to supplement its 8-hourTWA PEL of 1-mg/m3 TWA PEL for phosphoric acid.<ITAG tagnum="71">PHOSPHORUS TRICHLORIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7719-12-2; Chemical Formula: PCl<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1325</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for phosphorus trichloride was 0.5 ppm as an 8-hourTWA. The Agency proposed revising this limit to 0.2 ppm as an 8-hour TWAwith a STEL of 0.5 ppm; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with thisproposal. The final rule establishes these limits, which are consistentwith the limits recommended by the ACGIH. Phosphorus trichloride is a fuming,colorless, noncombustible liquid.The primary occupational hazards associated with exposure to phosphorustrichloride are respiratory irritation and intoxication involving cough,bronchitis, pneumonia, and conjunctivitis (Henderson and Haggard 1943e/Ex.1-1086; International Labour Office 1934b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 486; Sassi 1954/Ex. 1-931).Early studies indicate that severe symptoms did not occur in cats and guineapigs until concentration levels reached 50 to 90 ppm for exposures lastingone hour, although slight illness was observed at 0.7 ppm after an exposureof six hours (Butjagin 1904, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 486). However,by 1934, the effects of phosphorus trichloride were considered to be 5to 10 times as intense as those of hydrolyzed hydrochloric acid (InternationalLabour Office 1934b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 486). More recently,Weeks, Musselman, Yevich et al. (1964, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 486) reported studies in which 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> values of 104 ppm for rats and 50 ppm for guinea pigs wereobtained.OSHA received comments only from NIOSH on its proposal to establish a PELof 0.2 ppm TWA and a STEL of 0.5 ppm for phosphorus trichloride. Becauseof the acutely irritating effects of this substance, the Agency concludesthat both a TWA and a STEL are required to reduce the risk of respiratoryand eye irritation that exists for workers exposed to this substance. OSHAconsiders these effects to be material impairments of health. Therefore,OSHA is revising its limit for phosphorus trichloride to 0.2 ppm as an8-hour TWA and 0.5 ppm as a 15-minute STEL; these PELs are promulgatedin the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="71">POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1310-58-3; Chemical Formula: KOH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1334</ITAG>OSHA had no former limit for potassium hydroxide. A ceiling limit of 2mg/m3 was proposed by the Agency based on the ACGIH recommendation, andNIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal. OSHA has concludedthat this limit is necessary to afford workers protection from irritanteffects and is establishing the 2-mg/m3 ceiling limit for potassium hydroxidein the final rule. Potassium hydroxide is a white, deliquescent materialthat occurs in the form of pellets, sticks, lumps, or flakes.Potassium hydroxide is corrosive to tissues. The health hazards of potassiumhydroxide are similar to those of the other strong alkalies, such as sodiumhydroxide. These substances gelatinize tissue on contact, causing deep,painful lesions. Dust or mist exposures may cause eye or respiratory systemirritation and nasal septum lesions (Karpov 1971/Ex. 1-1115). Mr Gary Melampy of the Independent Lubricant Manufacturers Association(ILMA) (Ex. 3-830) commented that there was no basis for establishing anoccupational limit for potassium hydroxide. OSHA disagrees and notes thatthe irritant effects of potassium hydroxide dusts, mists, and aerosolshave been documented (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 495; Karpov 1971/Ex. 1-1115).Although dose-response data are lacking for this substance, it is reasonableto expect potassium hydroxide to exhibit irritant properties similar tothose of sodium hydroxide, a structurally related strong alkali. In itscriteria document, NIOSH (1976k/Ex. 1-965) cites a personal communication(Lewis 1974), which reported that short-term exposures (2 to 15 minutes)to 2-mg/m3 sodium hydroxide caused ``noticeable'' but not excessive upperrespiratory tract irritation. Therefore, OSHA finds that the 2-mg/m3 ceilinglimit will provide workers with an environment that minimizes respiratorytract irritation, which the Agency considers to be material impairmentof health. To reduce these risks, OSHA is establishing a ceiling limitof 2 mg/m3 for potassium hydoxide. <ITAG tagnum="71">PROPYLENE GLYCOL MONOMETHYL ETHER</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-98-2; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>OCH<T2>2</T2>CHOHCH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1343 </ITAG>OSHA had no former limit for propylene glycol monomethyl ether (PGME).The ACGIH recommends a TWA of 100 ppm and a STEL of 150 ppm, and thesewere the limits proposed. NIOSH has no REL for this substance but concurred(Ex. 8-47, Table N1; Ex. 150, Comments on PGME) with OSHA's proposed limits.The final rule promulgates an 8-hour TWA of 100 ppm and a STEL of 150 ppmfor PGME, which is a colorless liquid.Propylene glycol monomethyl ether is an irritant, neurotoxin, teratogen,and nasal tumorigen (Sax and Lewis 1989, p. 2904). Exposure causes anesthesiaat a level of approximately 1000 ppm and eye tearing at levels above 100ppm; at 100 ppm, PGME also has an objectionable odor (Stewart, Baretta,Dodd, and Torkelson 1970/Ex. 1-379). Ingestion of 3 g/kg in a 35-day periodcaused changes in the livers and kidneys of rats, and repeated dermal applicationsof 7 to 10 ml/kg/day caused death in rats treated over a 90-day period(Rowe, McCollister, Spencer et al. 1954/Ex. 1-435). Sax and Lewis (1989)report that exposure to this substance causes nausea, and that inhalationhas induced nasal tumors.Unlike many other members of the glycol ethers family, PGME has been shownnot to cause testicular effects at levels below 3000 ppm (NIOSH 1988/Ex.150). However, Sax and Lewis (1989) note that PGME is an experimental teratogen.Rats exposed by inhalation to 3000 ppm for six hours on days 6 through15 of gestation produced offspring with delayed skeletal ossification (Saxand Lewis 1989; Proctor, Hughes, and Fischman 1988).The final rule PELs for PGME of 100 ppm TWA and 150 ppm STEL are designedto protect workers from experiencing the acute effects of exposure to PGME,which include eye and skin irritation and nausea, and the chronic effectsof exposure, which include possible liver and kidney changes. Because PGMEwas not formerly regulated by OSHA, previous workplace exposures couldattain essentially uncontrolled levels, and OSHA has determined that an8-hour TWA of 100 ppm and a STEL of 150 ppm are necessary to protect againstthese significant occupational risks, which constitute material impairmentsof health. The Agency finds that the new limits will substantially reducethese significant risks.<ITAG tagnum="71">ROSIN CORE SOLDER PYROLSIS PRODUCTS, AS FORMALDEHYDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: None; Chemical Formula: None</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1350</ITAG>OSHA previously had no limit for rosin core solder pyrolysis products.Based on the ACGIH TLV, the Agency proposed an 8-hour TWA of 0.1 mg/m3for these compounds, measured as formaldehyde. OSHA had determined thata TWA limit of 0.1 mg/m3 is necessary to prevent workers from experiencingservere irritant reactions, and the Agency is including this limit in itsfinal rule. This limit applies to the thermal decomposition products ofgum rosin soldering flux (3 to 6 percent rosin and 30 to 70 percent tin-leadsolder) (Lozano and Melvin, unpublished data, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 514).A two-week exposure of guinea pigs and rats to these products at averageconcentrations of 0.96 mg/m3 caused reduction in rate of weight gain inmale guinea pigs, abnormal liver-to-body-weight ratios in guinea pigs ofboth sexes, and abnormal heart-to-body-weight ratios in male rats (industrialBio-test Lab, Inc., as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 514). Lungs of theanimals expose in this same study were hyperemic.In humans, slight bronchial irritation has been reported at 1 mg/m3 (IndustrialBio-test Laboratories, Inc. 1967, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 514). Severalworkers who were chronically exposed to levels as high as 0.15 mg/m3 hadto be removed from exposure because of intractable upper respiratory tractirritation; when concentrations were kept below 0.1 mg/m3, such irritationwas not reported (Christy 1965, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 514).In a study designed to quantify dose-response levels for irritation inhuman volunteers, subjects were exposed for 15 minutes to these productsat aldehyde concentrations (measured as formaldehyde, which is the bestindirect measure of rosin pyrolysis products) of 0.04 to 0.2 mg/m3 (U.S.Public Health Service 1965, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 514). Subjectsdetected the odor at 0.07 mg/m3, and 80 percent of subjects reported moderateto severe irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat at cencentrations of0.12 mg/m3 or above. At levels below 0.05 mg/m3, fewer than 10 percentof subjects experienced irritation. Mucous membrane irritation occurredin 30 percent of subjects exposed at 0.07 mg/m3 (U.S. Public Health Service1965, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 514).NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B; Tr. p. 3-97 to 3-98) did not concur with OSHA'sselection of a TWA limit of 0.1 mg/m3 and recommended a ceiling limit of0.1 ppm for a 15-minute period. In addition, NIOSH (the only commenterto the rulemaking record) considers these thermal decomposition productsto be likely candidates for a separate 6(b) rulemaking.OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.1 mg/m3, measured as formaldehyde,for rosin core solder pyrolysis products. OSHA concludes that this limitwill protect employees from the significant risk of respiratory tract irritation,which is a material impairment of health, that exists at levels above thenew PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">SODIUM BISULFITE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7631-90-5; Chemical Formula: NaHSO<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1365</ITAG>OSHA's Z tables previously included no exposure limit for sodium bisulfite.The Agency proposed to establish a limit of 5 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA, andit is establishing the PEL in the final rule. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1)agrees with the selection of this limit, which is the same as that recommendedby the ACGIH. Sodium bisulfite is a white crystalline powder and has anodor like that of sulfur dioxide.The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats fed this substance is 2 g/kg (Dow Chemical Company1977d, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 534), and the intraperitonealLD<T2>50</T2> for rats is 115 mg/kg (Hoppe and Goble 1951/Ex. 1-490). TheACGIH reports that sodium bisulfite is an eye, skin, and mucous membraneirritant; acute exposures have resulted in mild eye and respiratory effects(ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 534).One rulemaking participant, Mr. Gary Melampy of the Independent LubricantManufacturers Association (ILMA), remarked that OSHA's discussion of theproposed limit for sodium bisulfite in the preamble failed to demonstratean adequate basis for the limit. OSHA notes that dose-response data todemonstrate a no-effect level are lacking. The 5-mg/m3 limit was proposedbecause it represents a limit below that established for physical irritantparticulates, and this limit reflects the irritant properties of sodiumbisulfite. In the professional judgment of the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p.534), ``inhalation of or contact with the dust would result in high localconcentrations [of sodium bisulfite] in contact with high local concentrationsof sensitive tissue.'' The ACGIH further states that an occupational limitbelow that for physical irritant particulates ``seems definitely in order.''OSHA concurs with this assessment.Dr. Grace Ziem, an independent occupational physician (Ex. 46), expressedconcern about the adverse effects of sodium bisulfite on sensitized individuals.Although cases of severe, and even lethal, allergic reactions to this materialhave been documented from the use of sodium bisulfite as a food additive,OSHA does not believe that there is sufficient information to use as abasis for an exposure limit to protect against inhalation-induced allergicreactions.OSHA finds that exposure to this substance presents a significant riskof irritant effects at high concentrations, and that these effects constitutematerial impairments of health. Accordingly, to substantially reduce thisrisk, OSHA is establishing a 5-mg/m3 8-hour TWA for sodium bisulfite.<ITAG tagnum="71">SODIUM HYDROXIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1310-73-2; Chemical Formula: NaOH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1367</ITAG>The former OSHA limit for sodium hydroxide (also known as caustic sodaor lye) was 2 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA. OSHA proposed a 2-mg/m3 ceiling limitfor sodium hydroxide, based on the ACGIH- and NIOSH-recommended limits.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with the proposed limit, and thislimit is established in the final rule. Sodium hydroxide is a white, deliquescentsolid.Sodium hydroxide is a severe irritant of the eyes, mucous membranes, andskin. Exposure to sodium hydroxide in the form of a caustic dust irritatesthe uppper respiratory tract and may cause ulceration of the nasal passages(ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 535). Although inhalation of sodium hydroxide isusually of secondary importance in industrial exposures, the effects ofinhaling the dust or mist vary from mild irritation of the nose, whichoccurs on brief exposure to 2 mg/m3, to severe pneumonitis, which occursat very high exposures. The greatest industrial hazard is rapid tissuedestruction of the eyes or skin upon contact either with the solid or withconcentrated solutions (<T3>Chemical Hazards of the Workplace,</T3> 2nd ed., p. 444, Proctor, Hughes,and Fischman 1988).Contact with the eyes causes disintegration and sloughing of conjunctivaland corneal epithelium, corneal opacification, marked edema, and ulceration;after 7 to 13 days, either gradual recovery begins or there is a progressionto ulceration and corneal opacification. Complications of severe eye burnsare symblepharon with overgrowth of the cornea by a vascularized membrane,progressive or recurrent corneal ulceration, and permanent corneal opacification(Proctor, Hughes, and Fischman 1988, p. 444). Grant (1986/Ex. 1-975) statesthat sodium hydroxide causes ``some of the most severe, blinding injuriesof the eye. Because it may be considered public enemy number one for causingchemical burns of the eye, sodium hydroxide has been the chemical causticmost extensively studied in animal and clinical investigations.'' Clinically,the worst features of sodium hydroxide burns of the eye are the great rapiditywith which extreme damage can be done to the anterior segment of the eyeand the tendency for the cornea to ulcerate and perforate or to becomedensely vascularized and opaque.On the skin, solutions of 25 to 50 percent sodium hydroxide cause the sensationof irritation within about three minutes; with solutions of 4 percent,the sensation of burning does not occur until several hours later. If notremoved from the skin, sodium hydroxide causes severe burns with deep ulcerations.Exposure to the dust or mist of sodium hydroxide may cause multiple smallburns with temporary loss of hair (Proctor, Hughes, and Fischman 1988,p. 445). Nagao and co-workers (1972) examined skin biopsies from volunteerswho had had a 1 N solution (equal to a 4-percent solution) of sodium hydroxideapplied to their arms for 15 to 180 minutes. Progressive changes, beginningwith dissolution of the cells in the horny layer and progressing throughedema to total destruction of the epidermis, occurred within 60 minutes(Nagao, Stroud, Hamada et al. 1972).Rats were exposed to an aerosol of 40 percent aqueous sodium hydroxidewhose particles were less than 1 um in diameter. Exposures lasted for 30minutes and were administered twice a week. The experiment was terminatedafter three weeks because two of the 10 rats died. Histopathological examinationshowed mostly normal lung tissue with foci of enlarged alveolar septae,emphysema, bronchial ulceration, and enlarged lymph adenoidal tissues (Wands1981b, in <T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology,</T3> 3rd rev. ed., vol.2B, p. 3062).OSHA received only one comment on sodium hydroxide, from NIOSH (Ex. 150,Comments on Sodium Hydroxide); NIOSH supported OSHA's proposed limit andreported that no new information on the health effects of sodium hydroxidehad become available since the publication of the NIOSH criteria document(NIOSH 1976k/Ex. 1-965).The irritant effect of sodium hydroxide and its markedly corrosive actionon all body tissue can result even from brief (one minute or more) exposuresto airborne concentrations above the 2-mg/m3 level; the acute nature ofthese effects is evident in the studies described above. Therefore, OSHAconcludes that establishing a ceiling of 2 mg/m3 is necessary to reducethe significant risks of eye and skin burns and respiratory irritationthat occur as a result of very brief exposures to the higher levels ofsodium hydroxide that would be permitted with an 8-hour TWA PEL alone.OSHA considers the irritant effects resulting from exposure to sodium hydroxidematerial impairments of health. In the final rule, OSHA is accordinglyrevising its former 8-hour TWA limit for sodium hydroxide to a ceilinglimit of 2 mg/m3.<ITAG tagnum="71">SODIUM METABISULFITE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7681-57-4; Chemical Formula: Na<T2>2</T2>S<T2>2</T2>O<T2>5</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The Agencyproposed a 5-mg/m3 limit as an 8-hour TWA, based on the ACGIH recommendation,and is establishing this limit in the final rule. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) concurred with the selection of this limit. Sodium metabisulfite canoccur either in the form of a solid or as white crystals; this substancesmells like sulfur dioxide.A two-year study at the Dow Chemical Company (1977e, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 535), in which rats ingested 0.215 percent sodium metabisulfite,demonstrated no adverse effects in the rats. Other animal studies showa median lethal dose of 192 mg/kg for rabbits and 115 mg/kg for rats whensodium metabisulfite is injected intravenously (NIOSH 1973c, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 535). Inhalation of sodium metabisulfite dust isirritating to the lungs, nose, and throat (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 535).Dr. Grace Ziem, an independent physician (Ex. 46), expressed concern thatsensitized individuals may experience severe allergic reactions on exposureto sodium metabisulfite dust. Cases of severe, and even fatal, reactionshave been documented in individuals exposed by consuming food items containingmetabisulfite additive. At this time, OSHA believes there is insufficientdata on oral toxicity to use as a basis to extrapolate to the airborneconcentration likely to cause sensitization.OSHA proposed an 8-hour TWA of 5 mg/m3 for sodium metabisulfite. The agencyconcludes that establishing this limit is necessary to reduce the riskof skin and eye irritation associated with exposure to high concentrationsof sodium metabisulfite dust. OSHA has determined that these effects constitutematerial impairments of health. Accordingly, OSHA is promulgating a 5-mg/m3limit as an 8-hour TWA for this substance.<ITAG tagnum="71">SULFUR MONOCHLORIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 10025-67-9; Chemical Formula: S<T2>2</T2>Cl<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1376</ITAG>OSHA's former PEL for sulfur monochloride was 1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. Basedon the ACGIH recommendation, the Agency proposed revising this limit to1 ppm as a ceiling limit. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with OSHA'sproposed limit for this substance, and the final rule establishes it. Sulfurmonochloride is an amber, oily, nonflammable, fuming liquid, and has apenetrating odor.Sulfur monochloride is a primary irritant that affects the upper respiratorytract by releasing hydrochloric acid (HCl) on contact with moisture (Hendersonand Haggard 1943g, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 545). This same studynoted that ``undecomposed vapor [of sulfur monochloride] might reach thelungs, in which case it would be more toxic than an equivalent quantityof HCl.'' The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 545) considers these data indicativeof a far greater acute toxicity for sulfur monochloride than for hydrochloricacid. Animal toxicity studies revealed that a dose of 150 ppm sulfur monochlorideresulted in death to mice exposed for one minute (Flury and Zernik 1931k/Ex.1-979). Cats exposed to 60 ppm sulfur monochloride for 15 minutes all diedwithin a few days, but concentrations of 12 ppm for 15 minutes were tolerated(Henderson and Haggard 1943g, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 545).A study by Elkins (1959g, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 545) of workersin the rubber industry found that concentrations of 2 to 9 ppm sodium monochloridewere mildly irritating; however, the concentrations to which these workerswere exposed may have included a high proportion of hydrochloric acid.NIOSH was the only commenter on sulfur monochloride.The Agency concludes that the former TWA PEL of 1 ppm is inadequate toprotect exposed workers against the risk of primary irritation that couldoccur upon short-term exposure to elevated concentrations of sulfur monochloride.Since 2 ppm was reported to be an effect level for mild irritation, OSHAfinds that revising its limit to 1 ppm as a ceiling limit is a reasonableand necessary action to protect workers from the significant risk associatedwith lung irritation, which constitutes a material impairment of health.Therefore, OSHA is establishing a ceiling limit for sulfur monochlorideof 1 ppm.<ITAG tagnum="71">SULFUR PENTAFLUORIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 5714-22-7; Chemical Formula: S<T2>2</T2>F<T2>10</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1377</ITAG>The previous OSHA limit for sulfur pentafluoride was 0.025 ppm as an 8-hourTWA. OSHA proposed revising this limit to 0.01 ppm as a ceiling, and NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal. The Agency is establishingthis limit in the final rule. This limit is consistent with the ACGIH (1986/Ex.1-3) recommended limit. Sulfur pentafluoride is a colorless gas or liquidwith a sulfur-dioxide-like odor.Sulfur pentafluoride's toxic effects include lung congestion and lesions,and pulmonary edema. In a study in which rats were exposed to sulfur pentafluoridefor 16 to 18 hours, levels of 0.1 ppm caused lung irritation, 0.5 ppm resultedin severe pulmonary lesions, and 1 ppm proved fatal (Greenberg and Lester1950/Ex. 1-590). One-hour exposures to 10 ppm sulfur pentafluoride resultedin diffuse hemorrhagic lesions in the lungs of rats, while rats exposedto 1 ppm for one hour had severe congestion of the lungs. Rats exposedfor one hour to 0.1 ppm showed no effects. Subsequent examination of ratssurviving the 10- and 1-ppm exposures revealed that the lungs had returnedto normal after 24 hours (Greenberg and Lester 1950/Ex. 1-590). Saunders,Shoshkes, DeCarlo, and Brown (1953/Ex. 1-610) established that the LD<T2>50</T2> for sulfur pentafluoride in rabbits is 5.8 mg/kg, and thatdeath was due to fulminant pulmonary edema. According to this study, sulfurpentafluoride does not injure the columnar epithelium of the respiratorytract, and exposure is not followed by bronchopneumonia.Other than NIOSH's submission, OSHA received no comments on its proposalto revise the sulfur pentafluoride limit to 0.01 ppm as a ceiling. The0.01-ppm ceiling was selected on the basis of evidence showing that evenbrief exposures to 1 ppm caused pulmonary affects in animals and prolongedexposures to 0.1 ppm caused lung irritation in animals. OSHA concludesthat this limit for sulfur pentafluoride will reduce the risks of irritationand pulmonary effects to which workers could be exposed in the absenceof a ceiling limit. The Agency considers these effects material impairmentsof health. Therefore, OSHA is promulgating a ceiling limit for sulfur pentafluorideof 0.01 ppm.<ITAG tagnum="71">TETRAHYDROFURAN</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 109-99-9; Chemical Formula: (C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>4</T2>)<T2>2</T2>O</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

TheAgency proposed revising this limit to 200 ppm TWA with a 15-minute STELof 250 ppm and is establishing these limits, which are consistent withthose recommended by the ACGIH, in the final rule. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) concurred with OSHA's proposal to add a STEL for this substance. Tetrahydrofuranis a colorless liquid with an odor like that of ether.This proposed limit was selected on the basis of extensive data from experimentalanimal studies. Lehmann and Flury (1943c/Ex. 1-879) reported irritationof the upper respiratory tract as well as kidney and liver injury in anumber of animals exposed by inhalation to more than 3000 ppm tetrahydrofuranfor 20 days, eight hours daily. Aqueous solutions exceeding a concentrationof 20 percent tetrahydrofuran proved irritating to the skin of rabbits.One study (Stoughton and Robbins 1936/Ex. 1-597) found that tetrahydrofuranconcentrations in excess of 25,000 ppm were needed to anesthetize dogs.The anesthesia process in these animals showed a delayed induction periodand poor recovery. In other studies with dogs (Zapp 1971, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 564, 200 ppm tetrahydrofuran in daily six-hour inhalationexposures produced an observable effect on the pulse pressure of theseanimals within three to four weeks; despite an exposure of nine weeks atthis dosage level followed by three weeks at nearly twice this concentration,no histopathologic changes were observed in the critical organs. Studies(Jochmann 1961/Ex. 1-1021) in which tetrahydrofuran was given orally andperitoneally to a variety of laboratory animals resulted in both liverand kidney damage; however, some of the effects observed by this authormay have been caused by peroxide contamination of the tetrahydrofuran.Oettel (as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 564) observed no kidney or liverdamage in cats, rabbits, rats, or mice exposed repeatedly by inhalationto tetrahydrofuran at concentrations of 3400 to 17,000 ppm for as longas six hours. Technicians involved in the experiment of Stoughton and Robbins(1936/Ex. 1-597, described above) experienced severe headaches when conductingthese experiments.Dr. Larry Hecker, Director of Corporate Industrial Hygiene and Toxicologyfor Abbott Laboratories, commented that there was no toxicological basisto justify a STEL for tetrahydrofuran (Ex. 3-678). However, OSHA believesthat the severe headaches experienced by researchers conducting animalexperiments (Stoughton and Robbins 1936/Ex. 1-597) are indicative of anacute effect that constitutes material impairment of health and is bestavoided by establishing a short-term limit. OSHA also notes that the ACGIH(<T3>Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indicies for 1988-1989</T3>,ACGIH 1988b) has not proposed to delete its recommended STEL for this substance.Therefore, OSHA finds that both a 200-ppm 8-hour TWA and a 250-ppm STELare necessary to reduce the risk of long-term systemic and acute effectsassociated with exposure to tetrahydrofuran and is establishing these limitsin the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="71">TETRASODIUM PYROPHOSPHATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7722-88-5; Chemical Formula: Na<T2>4</T2>P<T2>2</T2>O<T2>7</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

This limitis established in the final rule and is consistent with the ACGIH recommendation.Tetrasodium pyrophosphate may occur as either a white powder or a crystallinesubstance.Tetrasodium pyrophosphate is an alkaline dust and therefore causes irritationto the eyes and the respiratory tract (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 567). Forthis reason, the ACGIH recommended a time-weighted average TLV of 5 mg/m3,which is one-half the value recommended for irritant dusts. NIOSH's commentswas the only one submitted on OSHA's proposal to issue a 5-mg/m3 8-hourTWA for this substance.The Agency concludes that this previously unregulated chemical poses asignificant risk of eye and respiratory tract irritation to workers potentiallyexposed to high concentrations. OSHA has determined that these irritanteffects represent material impairments of health. Accordingly, OSHA ispromulgating a 5-mg/m3 8-hour TWA limit for tetrasodium pyrophosphate inthe final rule.<ITAG tagnum="71">THIOGLYCOLIC ACID</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 68-11-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>4</T2>O<T2>2</T2>S</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1392</ITAG>OSHA had no former PEL for thioglycolic acid. The Agency proposed a 1-ppm8-hour TWA, with a skin notation, for this colorless liquid, which hasan unpleasant odor; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal.The 1-ppm TWA limit and the skin notation, which are the same limits asrecommended by the ACGIH, are established in the final rule.A study by the Dow Chemical Company (1973b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 571) in which thioglycolic acid was instilled into the eyes ofrabbits resulted in severe conjunctival inflammation and pain, dense opacityof the cornea, and severe inflammation of the iris. These effects had notimproved 14 days after exposure and washing immediately after exposuredid not modify the severity of this ocular response. A single dermal applicationof thioglycolic acid to rabbit skin caused necrosis within five minutesand was accompanied by hyperemia and edema. The LD<T2>50</T2> for a 10-percent solution applied percutaneously was 848 mg/kgfor rabbits (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3); further studies by Dow (1973b, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 571), in which female rats were fed a singleoral dose of a 10-percent solution of thioglycolic acid, showed that thisdose resulted in death at the level of 125 mg/kg. Autopsy revealed damageto the liver and gastrointestinal tract. Fassett (1963b, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 571) reported that the oral LD<T2>50</T2> for undiluted thioglycolic acid in rats was 50 mg/kg, and thata 10-percent solution applied to the skin of guinea pigs caused fatalitiesat doses of less than 5 ml/kg. Symptoms prior to death included gasping,convulsions, and weakness. No rulemaking participants, other than NIOSH, commented on OSHA's proposalto establish a 1-ppm 8-hour TWA limit for thioglycolic acid. The evidencedescribed above clearly demonstrates that this substance is a potent irritant;accordingly, OSHA finds that a limit on airborne exposure is necessaryto protect workers from the risk of eye and skin irritation and systemiceffects, which constitute material impairments of health. Therefore, OSHAis establishing a 1-ppm 8-hour TWA limit for this substance. In addition,the animal evidence shows that thioglycolic acid solutions readily penetratethe skin in lethal quantities (the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 848 mg/kg). Thus, OSHA finds that a skin notationis necessary to limit dermal contract and is adding this notation to itslimit for thioglycolic acid.<ITAG tagnum="71">1,2,4-TRICHLOROBENZENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 120-82-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>3</T2>Cl<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1405</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no limit for 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene and proposed to establisha limit of 5 ppm as a ceiling for this substance. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) concurred with this proposal. The final rule establishes this limit,which is consistent with the ACGIH recommendation. 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzeneis a colorless, stable liquid at room temperature, with an odor similarto that of o-dichlorobenzene.The inhalation toxicity of 1,2,4-Trichlorobenzene was studied by Treon(1950, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 593), who determined that thetarget organs of exposure in cats, dogs, rats, rabbits, and guinea pigsincluded the liver, kidneys, ganglion cells at all brain levels, and mucousmembranes. Irritation of the lungs and changes in respiration were seenin animals that later died as a result of exposure. Brown, Muir, and Thorpe(1969/Ex. 1-537) reported that 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene's single-dose oralLD<T2>50</T2> is 756 mg/kg for rats and 766 mg/kg for mice. The acute percutaneousLD<T2>50</T2> for rats was 6139 mg/kg. Sublethal doses administered repeatedlyto guinea pigs caused liver damage; acute and short-term (15 six-hour exposuresto 70 to 200 ppm) inhalation studies failed to kill these animals (Gage1970/Ex. 1-318). In a separate study reported on by Rowe (1975, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 593), 20 male rats, 4 rabbits, and 2 dogs wereexposed at levels of 30 or 100 ppm, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene for seven hours/day,five days/week, for a total of 30 exposures in 44 days. No adverse effectswere detected in exposed animals belonging to 30 species as a result ofexposure to 30 ppm, with the exception of an elevation of urinary porphyrinsin the rats at days 15 and 30 of exposure. A second inhalation study wasperformed with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene administered seven hours/day, fivedays/week for 26 consecutive weeks (Coate, Schoenfisch, Busey, and Lewis1977, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 593). Thirty rats, 16 rabbits,and 9 monkeys, all males were exposed at 0, 25, 50, or 100 ppm. Microscopicchanges were seen in the parenchymal cells of the livers and kidneys ofall rats after weeks 4 and 13 of exposure to 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, butno adverse effects were seen in any of the other species.In workers exposure to 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene caused dermal irritation,which may have been attributable to the defatting action of this chemical(Powers, Coate, and Lewis 1975/Ex. 1-658), and in some cases, exposurelevels of 3 to 5 ppm caused eye and throat irritation (Rowe 1975, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 593). NIOSH was the only rulemaking participantto submit comments on 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene.The Agency concludes that the PPL being established today will protectworkers from the risk of eye, throat, and dermal irritation associatedwith exposure to this substance; these adverse effects represent materialimpairments of health. To afford workers this protection, OSHA is promulgatinga ceiling limit of 5 ppm for 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene.<ITAG tagnum="71">TRIETHYLAMINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 121-44-8; Chemical Formula: C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>)<T2>3</T2>N</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1408</ITAG>OSHA previously had a limit of 25 ppm TWA for triethylamine. Based on theACGIH recommendation, the Agency proposed revising this limit to 10 ppmas a TWA and 15 ppm as a 15-minute STEL for this colorless liquid witha strong, ammonia-like odor. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred withthis proposal, and OSHA establishing these limits for triethylamine.Exposure to triethylamine is associated with pulmonary, skin, and eye irritationand central nervous system effects. Guinea pigs exposed for 30 minutesto a concentration of 2000 ppm triethylamine survived, but four of sixanimals died when exposed to this level for two hours; two of six guineapigs died during a four-hour exposure to a concentration of 1000 ppm, butall survived similar exposures at the 250- and 500-ppm levels (Carpenter,Smyth, and Shaffer 1948/Ex. 1-892). The single-dose oral LD<T2>50</T2> value in rats is 0.46 g/kg (range: 0.25 to 0.85) (Smyth, Carpenter,and Weil 1951/Ex. 1-439). These investigators also reported that triethylaminereadily penetrated rabbit skin on contact, with an LD<T2>50</T2> value of 0.57 ml/kg (range: 0.36 to 0.90); skin irritationand eye injury were also noted from contact with the liquid. One of sixrats died from an acute four-hour inhalation exposure to 1000 ppm triethylamine(Smyth, Carpenter, and Weil 1951/Ex. 1-439). Rabbits exposed repeatedlyto a level of 50 ppm exhibited marked irritation of the cornea and of pulmonarytissue (Brieger and Hodes 1951/Ex. 408; Carpenter and Smyth 1946/Ex. 859).The effects of repeated triethylamine exposure correspond to those of ethylamineand dietyhylamine (Brieger and Hodes 1951/Ex. 1-408). Triethylamine wasalso found to inhibit monoamine oxidase activity, resulting in centralnervous system stimulation (De Bruin 1976/Ex. 1-895). OSHA received a comment on its proposal to revise the limit for triethylaminefrom Mr. H.K. Thompson, Corporate Industrial Hygienist for Caterpiller,Inc. (Ex. 3-349), who agreed that the 25-ppm PEL is too high, but recommendedthat OSHA establish a 15-ppm TWA and a 25-ppm STEL. He stated that, inhis experience, where triethylamine is used as a catalyst in the makingof foundry cores, 16 ppm ``produces no irritation or `halo' effect.'' OSHA appreciates the suggestion made by Mr. Thompson; however, the Agencyis concerned that his suggestion STEL of 25 ppm is not sufficiently protective,given that rabbits exposed repeatedly to 50 ppm exhibited marked irritationof the cornea and pulmonary tissue. OSHA judges that a somewhat greatermargin of safety is called for to protect employees who may regularly beexposed to short-term elevated concentrations of triethylamine. Therefore,OSHA is establishing the limits originally proposed for triethylamine,which are 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 15 ppm as a 15-minute STEL. The Agencybelieves that these limits are necessary to reduce the significant riskof irritation, which constitutes a material impairment of health that isassociated with exposure to this substance. <ITAG tagnum="71">VANADIUM (V</ITAG><T2>2</T2>O<T2>5</T2>) DUST, RESPIRABLE<ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1314-62-1; Chemical Formula: V<T2>2</T2>O<T2>5</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

This limit is the same as that recommended bythe ACGIH. Vanadium pentoxide is a yellow to rust brown crystalline compound.Several studies indicate that OSHA's current exposure limit is insufficientto protect exposed workers against vanadium dust's respiratory effects,which include bronchitis, emphysema, tracheitis, pulmonary edema, and bronchialpneumonia. According to Hudson (1964/Ex. 1-880), vanadium is poisonousto all animals by all routes of administration. The LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits injected intravenously was 1.5 mg/kg, and rats fed25 ppm demonstrated toxic responses within a short time (Hudson 1964/Ex.1-880).Seven cases of upper respiratory tract irritation were reported in boilercleaners exposed to concentrations ranging from 2 to 85 mg/m\3\ vanadiumpentoxide dust (SjoandCx.174;3berg 1951/Ex. 1-437). Williams (1952/Ex. 1-456)reported eight cases of vanadium poisoning in workers cleaning boilersin an atmosphere ranging from 30 to 104 mg/m\3\. Gul'ko (1956, as citedby Hudson 1964/Ex. 1-880) observed eye and bronchial irritation in workersexposed to 0.5 to 2.2 mg/m\3\. A study by Lewis (1959/Ex. 1-345) indicatedthat workers exposed to levels of 0.2 to 0.5 mg/m\3\ experienced a higherincidence of respiratory symptoms than did controls. Tebrock and Machle(1968/Ex. 1-446) reported that workers exposed to average concentrationsof 1.5 mg/m\3\ vanadium pentoxide in a mixed dust developed conjunctivitis,tracheobronchitis, and dermatitis. A single average eight-hour exposureto 0.2 mg/m\3\ respirable vanadium dust caused severe upper respiratorytract irritation in five human volunteers, and two other subjects exposedto a 0.1-mg/m\3\ concentration also developed delayed cough and an increasein mucous production (Zenz and Berg 1967/Ex. 1-405). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N7; Tr. p. 3-99) recommended a ceiling limit of0.05 mg/m\3\ for a 15 minute period for this substance. The Workers Institutefor Safety and Health (WISH) (Ex. 116, pp. 53) supported NIOSH's recommendation.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a limit of 0.05 mg/m \3\ as an8-hour TWA for respirable vanadium dust, measured as vanadium pentoxide.The Agency concludes that this limit will prevent or substantially reducethe risks of eye and bronchial irritation, respiratory symptoms, conjunctivitis,and coughing seen in workers exposed at levels ranging from 0.1 to 2.2mg/m\3\. OSHA considers these exposure-related effects material impairmentsof health. <ITAG tagnum="71">VANADIUM (V</ITAG><T2>2</T2>O<T2>5</T2>) FUME<ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1314-62-1; Chemical Formula: V<T2>2</T2>O<T2>5</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The Agency proposed to revise this limit to 0.05 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hourTWA, based on the ACGIH recommendation. OSHA is establishing this limitin the final rule. Vanadium pentoxide fume's chief toxic effects are manifested in the respiratorypassages: bronchitis, emphysema, tracheitis, pulmonary edema, and bronchialpneumonia can result from exposure. According to Hudson (1964/Ex. 1-880),vanadium is poisonous to all animals by all routes of administration. TheLD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits injected intravenously is 1.5 mg/kg, and rats fed25 ppm demonstrated toxic responses within a short time (Hudson 1964/Ex.1-880).Seven cases of upper respiratory tract irritation were reported in boilercleaners exposed to concentrations of from 2 to 85 mg/m3 vanadium pentoxidefume (SjoandCx.174;3berg 1951/Ex. 1-437). Williams (1952/Ex. 1-456) reportedeight cases of vanadium poisoning in workers cleaning boilers in an atmosphereranging from 30 to 104 mg/m3. Gul'ko (1956, as cited by Hudson 1964/Ex.1-880) observed eye and bronchial irritation in workers exposed to 0.5to 2.2 mg/m3. A study by Lewis (1954/Ex. 1-345) indicated that workersexposed to levels of 0.2 to 0.5 mg/m3 experienced a higher incidence ofrespiratory symptoms than did controls. Tebrock and Machle (1968/Ex. 1-446)reported that workers exposed to average concentrations of 1.5 mg/m3 vanadiumpentoxide in a mixed dust developed conjunctivitis, tracheobronchitis,and dermatitis. A single average eight-hour exposure to 0.2 mg/m3 respirablevanadium dust caused severe upper respiratory tract irritation in fivehuman volunteers, and two other subjects exposed to a 0.1-mg/m3 concentrationalso developed delayed cough and an increase in mucous production (Zenzand Berg 1967/Ex. 1-405). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N7) recommended a 15-minute ceiling limit of 0.05mg/m3 for vanadium fume as vanadium pentoxide. However, OSHA is concernedabout cumulative exposures below the former 0.1 mg/m3 ceiling, and theAgency concludes that the TWA limit originally proposed will protect workersfrom the significant risks of eye, skin, and upper respiratory tract irritation;conjunctivitis; pulmonary damage; and systemic poisoning associated withexposure to vanadium pentoxide fume at even brief excursions to higherlevels. The Agency considers these irritant and systemic effects to bematerial impairments of health. Accordingly, OSHA is establishing a PELof 0.05 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA for this substance in today's rule. <ITAG tagnum="71">VINYL ACETATE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-05-4; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>COOCH=CH<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1424 </ITAG>There was no previous OSHA limit for vinyl acetate. OSHA proposed establishinga 10-ppm TWA and a 20-ppm STEL for this substance, based on the ACGIH recommendation,and the final rule establishes these limits. Vinyl acetate is a volatileliquid that polymerizes in light to a colorless, transparent mass and usuallycontains an inhibitor, such as hydroquinone. The basis for the proposed limits is an epidemiologic report by Deese andJoyner (1969/Ex. 1-412) describing 15 years of industrial experience withvinyl acetate production. These authors reported that vinyl acetate isnot a significant irritant at exposure levels of 5 to 10 ppm but causescough and hoarseness at around 22 ppm. They also found no evidence of adversechronic effects resulting from exposure to 5 to 10 ppm, as determined frommedical records and examinations. While conducting air sampling for thestudy, the primary author (Deese) experienced hoarseness at concentrationsof 4.2 to 5.7 ppm, and eye irritation at 5.7 to 6.8 ppm. Three chemicaloperators and one technician did not report any subjective responses atthese levels. The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 621) also cited a personal communicationfrom the Mellon Institute (1968) stating that vinyl acetate concentrationsof less than 5 ppm are detectable by odor, although some individuals maydetect the odor at concentrations of 0.5 ppm (Mellon Institute 1968, ascited by ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 621). NIOSH (1978i, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 621) reviewed these dataand concluded that the recommended exposure limit be designed to protecteven the most sensitive individuals from sensory irritant effects. Sincethe lowest level reported to cause upper respiratory tract irritation was4.2 ppm (Deese and Joyner 1969/Ex. 1-412), NIOSH recommended that workplaceexposure not exceed 4 ppm measured over a 15-minute period. In its prehearingsubmission (Ex. 8-47, Table N2), NIOSH continued to recommend its earlierlimit. The NIOSH REL of 4 ppm (ceiling) relies on a report concerning the experienceof a single individual; in contrast, the limits being established todayare based on a 15-year epidemiology study that suggests that a 10-ppm TWAand a 20-ppm STEL will provide protection against the risk of irritationassociated with exposure to vinyl acetate at higher levels. OSHA considersthe irritation caused by exposure to vinyl acetate a material impairmentof health. Therefore, the Agency is promulgating this 8-hour TWA and STELcombination as the revised limits for vinyl acetate.<ITAG tagnum="71">VM andamp; P NAPHTHA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS No. 8032-32-4; Chemical Formula: none </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1429 </ITAG>OSHA formerly had no PEL for VM andamp; P (Varnish Markers' and Printers')naphtha. The Agency proposed to establish an 8-hour TWA of 300 ppm anda STEL of 400 ppm for this substance. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurredwith these limits, which are based on the ACGIH TLVs. These limits areestablished in the final rule. VM andamp; P naphtha, also known as ligroin,is a colorless, flammable liquid. A study in which rats and beagles received inhalation doses of 500 ppmVM andamp; P naphtha for 30 hours per week for 13 weeks resulted in no chronicor latent effects (Carpenter, Kinkead, Geary et al. 1975a/Ex. 1-302). Theseauthors also noted that the acute toxicity of VM andamp; P naphtha for ratsand other species was four times greater than that of rubber solvent naphtha,which has a limit of 400 ppm. Carpenter and associates (1975a/Ex. 1-302)also reported on an experiment in which rats lost coordination and wentinto convulsions within 15 minutes during exposures to saturation concentrationsat ambient room temperature. The 4-hour inhalation LC<T2>50</T2> was 3400 ppm, and the acclimated rats survived 5800 ppm forsix hours.Seven human volunteers exposed to 880 ppm VM andamp; P naphtha for 15 minutesreported upper respiratory tract, eye, and nose irritation, in additionto olfactory fatigue (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 631). Elkins (1959d, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 631) noted one case of a worker, exposed to levelsof VM andamp; P naphtha averaging 800 ppm, who developed unspecified chroniceffects. Elkins also reported that the VM andamp; P naphtha level producingsignificant irritation in human volunteers was about half as great forthis form of naphtha as for rubber solvent naphtha. The Agency concludes that the 300-ppm TWA is necessary to protect workersagainst the risk of possible chronic effects associated with naphtha exposure.In addition, OSHA finds that a STEL is necessary to prevent upper respiratorytract and eye irritation, which are considered by OSHA to be material impairmentsof health that have been demonstrated to occur on short-term exposure to880 ppm VM andamp; P naphtha (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 631); the proposed 300-ppmTWA limit alone would permit such excursions. Therefore, OSHA is establishingboth a 300-ppm 8-hour TWA and a 400-ppm STEL for VM andamp; P naphtha inthe final rule. <ITAG tagnum="71">XYLENES, (o-, m-, AND p-ISOMERS)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1330-20-7; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>(CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1431</ITAG>The previous OSHA limit for the xylenes was 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. Basedon the ACGIH recommendation, OSHA proposed to revise this limit to a TWAof 100 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 150 ppm. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1)as well as the AFL-CIO (Ex. 194) concurred with these limits, and theyare established in the final rule. The xylene isomers are clear, flammableliquids with an aromatic hydrocarbon odor.Rats and rabbits exposed to a mixture of xylene isomers at a concentrationof 690 ppm for eight hours daily, six days per week showed no blood abnormalities,but rabbits exposed on the same regimen at 1150 ppm for 55 days showeda decrease in red and white blood cell counts and an increase in plateletcount (Fabre and Truhaut 1954, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 637).Studies of workers exposed to xylene revealed headache, fatigue, lassitude,irritability, and gastrointestinal disturbances as the most common symptoms(Gerarde 1960d/Ex. 1-738a). At unspecified exposure levels, Browning (1965b/Ex.1-1016) also noted gastrointestinal disturbances, in addition to kidney,heart, liver, and neurological damage; blood dyscrasias, some of whichresulted in death, were also reported in these workers. A study by Nelson,Enge, Ross et al. (1943/Ex. 1-66), in which human volunteers were exposedto 200 ppm xylene, found eye, nose, and throat irritation in the subjectsat this level of exposure.NIOSH developed a criteria document for xylene in 1975 (NIOSH 1975; ascited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 637), in which the work of Morley, Eccleston,Douglas, and colleagues (1970/Ex. 1-794) was discussed). These authorsobserved liver dysfunction and renal impairment in three workers overexposedto xylene (estimated concentration of 10,000 ppm). One of these workersdied, but the others recovered slowly. Furniture polishers were reportedby Matthaus (1964/Ex. 1-830) to have suffered corneal damage as a resultof exposure to xylene at unknown concentrations.One other commenter, Stanley L. Dryen of Chevron Corporation (Ex. 3-896,p. 15), objected to OSHA's issuing of a STEL, stating that there was nobasis for one. OSHA disagrees and points out that a 100-ppm TWA limit alonewould permit short-term exposure to several hundred ppm xylene, well abovethe 200-ppm level reported to be irritating as a result of short-term exposures.OSHA notes that NIOSH also recommends a short-term limit to supplementthe TWA.After reviewing this evidence, OSHA concludes that both a TWA and a STELare necessary to prevent the risks of narcosis, blood effects, and irritanteffects at the elevated levels possible at the current exposure limit.The Agency considers the effects of narcosis, irritation, and blood effectsto constitute material impairments of health and functional capacity. Therefore,to reduce the risk of irritation to workers exposed to the xylenes, OSHAis establishing a 150-ppm STEL and a 100-ppm TWA for xylene isomers inthe final rule.<ITAG tagnum="71">ZINC CHLORIDE (FUME)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7646-85-7; Chemical Formula: ZnCl<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1435</ITAG>OSHA's former PEL for zinc chloride was 1 mg/m \3\ as an 8-hour TWA. TheAgency proposed a TWA of 1 mg/m \3\, with a STEL of 2 mg/m \3\, for thissubstance, based on the ACGIH recommendation. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1)concurred with this proposal, and these limits are established in the finalrule. Zinc chloride fume is white and has an acrid odor.Zinc chloride fume is highly caustic and damages the mucous membranes ofthe nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Exposure to the fumes of the zincchloride may result in a severe pneumonitis that is caused by irritationof the respiratory tract (Gafafer 1964/Ex. 1-1149). One instance in whicha worker inhaled zinc chloride fumes resulted in advanced pulmonary fibrosisthat ended in death (Milliken, Waugh, and Kadish 1963/Ex. 1-751), and 10deaths and 25 nonfatal cases of pneumonitis occurred in workers caughtin a tunnel when 79 smoke generators caught fire and generated zinc chloridefumes (Hunter 1955/Ex. 1-853). Other studies have shown that zinc chlorideexposures cause skin ulceration (Sax 1957/Ex. 1-1095). It has also beensuggested that zinc chloride exposure may have chronic effects (Hamiltonand Hardy 1974b/Ex. 1-958). In an investigation of the adverse effectsof zinc chloride fume exposures, Ferry (1966, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 643) reported that no sensory effects occurred when 30-minute exposureswere limited to 0.07 and 0.4 mg/m\3\; however, this researcher noted thatthese levels did corrode metal. Other than NIOSH's submission, no commentswere received by OSHA on the proposed limits for zinc chloride fume.OSHA concludes that the risk of damage to the eyes, skin, and respiratorytract associated with short-term exposure to zinc chloride fume, whichare considered by OSHA to be material impairments of health, should besubstantially reduced by establishing both a STEL and a TWA. Therefore,in the final rule, OSHA is promulgating a 1-mg/m\3\ TWA limit and 2-mg/m\3\STEL for this substance.Conclusions for the Group of Sensory IrritantsOSHA finds that sensory irritation poses an occupational health risk toworkers exposed to these substances at the Agency's former exposure limits.Among the adverse health consequences of exposure to sensory irritantsare acute breathing difficulty, eye tearing, conjunctivitis, sensitization,persistent coughing, and upper respiratory tract irritation. OSHA has determinedthat these effects constitute material impairments of health and functionalcapacity within the meaning of the Act. In addition to the pain and sufferingassociated with these signs and symptoms, workers experiencing irritanteffects find it difficult if not impossible to concentrate on the job athand; they therefore work less safely and less productively than nonexposedemployees. Reducing exposures from levels that have been associated withthese effects to levels where such consequences are substantially lesslikely to occur will reduce the significant risk posed to workers at currentlevels. Furthermore, many of the substances in this group have been demonstratedto have adverse effects on other organ systems, including the cornea, lungs,kidney, liver, central nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract. OSHAfinds that promulgation of the new or revised limits for the substancesin this group will also further reduce the possibility of harm to theseorgan systems.OSHA concludes that the health evidence for these substances forms a reasonablebasis for establishing revised or new limits, and that establishing theselimits is necessary to reduce the risk of sensory irritation effects toexposed workers. OSHA concludes that sensory irritation constitutes a materialimpairment of health and functional capacity.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Liver orKidney Effects</ITAG>IntroductionThe liver or the kidneys are the primary target organs affected by toxicexposures to a number of industrial chemicals. In recognition of this targetorgan toxicity, OSHA is establishing new or revised limits for 17 hepato-or nephrotoxic compounds (12 hepatotoxins and five nephrotoxins). For thesesubstances, the liver or kidney appears to be the organ most sensitiveto the effects of exposure. Thus, establishing permissible exposure limitsthat are low enough to prevent toxicity to these target organs generallyalso protects other organ systems.For seven of the 12 substances for which limits were based on liver toxicity,OSHA is lowering the PEL, and for three substances, OSHA is adding a short-termexposure limit. For two substances, OSHA is adding a PEL where none previouslyexisted. For three kidney toxins, OSHA is establishing new PELs; in onecase, it is reducing an existing TWA-PEL, and, in another case, it is reducingits current PEL and adding a STEL. The sections below discuss liver andkidney toxins separately. Table C4-1 shows these hepatotoxic substancesand their former, proposed, and final rule limits, CAS, and HS numbers;Table C4-2 provides the same information for the nephrotoxins in this group.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M003</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 578_580</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Liver Toxicity</ITAG>Description of the Health EffectsAlthough the precise mechanisms by which these compounds cause liver damageare only partly understood, the development and manifestation of livertoxicity are similar for all of them. In general, liver toxicity is a gradedresponse (i.e., the severity of the lesion is directly proportional tothe intensity/duration of exposure). Although many of the effects causedby exposure to these substances are reversible, some are not.Liver damage is not a single entity; the manner in which it is manifesteddepends upon the dose, duration, and particular chemical agent involved.For example, acute exposures may cause lipid accumulation in the hepatocytes,cellular death, and hepatobiliary dysfunction. In contrast, chronic exposuresmay lead to cirrhotic changes and the development of neoplasms. Fatty accumulationand necrosis can be either localized or widespread, and chemically inducedlesions resulting from chromic exposures can cause marked changes of theentire liver (Plaa 1986/Ex. 1-183).Typically, the earliest and most sensitive indicators of liver toxicityare alterations in biochemical liver functions, such as changes in specificenzyme activities. These may be accompanied by changes in the morphologyof specific organelles in hepatocytes. For example, relatively low dosesof halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as allyl chloride, carbon tetrabromide,and ethylene dichloride, cause an increase in the activity of microsomalmixed-function oxidase enzymes. This increase is ordinarily accompaniedby proliferation of the endoplasmic reticulum.Many compounds that damage the liver, such as 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane,also cause an abnormal accumulation of fat, especially of triglycerides,in liver cells. In experimental animals, this effect is manifested as anaccumulation of microscopic vacuoles in liver cells. In humans, however,the only grossly detectable manifestation of this effect is increased liversize, which is an indication of severe fat accumulation in the liver.At sufficiently high doses, most substances that damage the liver causecell death that leads to tissue necrosis or gangrene. This necrosis mayinitially be localized, but, at higher or more sustained exposure levels,the entire liver may be involved. Moderate to severe liver necrosis isusually accompanied by increased concentrations of marker enzymes suchas glutamate-pyruvate transaminase or glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminasein the serum; the detection of these substances in the serum of exposedindividuals can thus be a useful diagnostic tool.Dose-Response CharacteristicsThe development of liver and other organ damage in humans and animals isprogressive; it begins with subcellular changes, progresses to the cellularlevel, and is finally manifested as whole-organ damage. This progressionis related to the intensity/duration of dose (i.e., as dose increases,cellular death becomes widespread and eventually causes liver dysfunction).The extent to which liver damage is reversible follows a similar continuum;since the liver can regenerate, minor cellular damage or transient diseasestates are usually reversible if exposure ceases. However, if exposurecontinues, the capacity of the liver to regenerate is exceeded and permanentdamage results. As is the case for some chemically induced toxic effects,there appears to be a NOE level below which hepatotoxic effects do notoccur.The following paragraphs describe OSHA's findings for all of the substancesin this group of hepatotoxins and discuss the record evidence and the natureof the material health impairments experienced by exposed workers.<ITAG tagnum="71">ALLYL CHLORIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-05-1; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2> = CHCH<T2>2</T2>C1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1011</ITAG>The former OSHA PEL for allyl chloride was a 1-ppm (3-mg/m\3\) 8-hour TWA;the proposed PEL was also 1 ppm, with a 15-minute STEL of 2 ppm. NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with the proposed limits. In the final rule,OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 1 ppm and a STEL of 2 ppm forthis substance; these limits are consistent with those of the ACGIH. Allylchloride is a colorless liquid with an unpleasant, pungent odor.Studies of animal exposures to allyl chloride indicate that this chemicalis among the most toxic of the halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, producingmucous membrane irritation, mild narcosis, and, at higher concentrations,histologic lesions of the lungs and kidneys (Adams, Spencer, and Irish1940/Ex. 1-584). Even single exposures lasting only a few minutes at concentrationsbetween 1 and 100 mg/liter (332 to 32,000 ppm) caused mucous membrane irritationin various laboratory animals; at 8-ppm concentrations for five weeks,kidney and liver damage were observed (Adams, Spencer, and Irish 1940/Ex.1-584). Further animal studies have confirmed liver and kidney pathologyin many species (Torkelson, Wolf, Oyen, and Rowe 1959/Ex. 1-691), and femalerats exhibited kidney pathology after exposure to 3 ppm for six months.Exposures of 50 to 100 ppm for five minutes in humans caused eye and noseirritation, and five-minute exposures below 25 ppm have been associatedwith pulmonary irritation (Shell Chemical Corp. 1974, as cited in Ex. 150).Humans exposed to concentrations of 1 to 113 ppm showed abnormal livertest results (Hausler and Lenich 1968/Ex. 1-1035).In a posthearing comment (Ex. 150, Comments on Allyl Chloride), NIOSH reportedthe results of a recent National Cancer Institute monograph (Santodonatoet al. 1985, as cited in Ex. 150) showing that allyl chloride is a tumorinitiator in mice and a mutagen in bacterial test systems. NIOSH (Ex. 150)and Drs. Grace Ziem and Barry Castleman (Ex. 114A) discussed recent epidemiologicaland clinical studies from the People's Republic of China (He et al. 1985,as cited in Exs. 114A and 150), which also found toxic polyneuropathy inworkers exposed to between 2.6 and 6650 mg/m\3\ allyl chloride for durationsranging from 2.5 months to 6 years; in contrast, workers at another facilitywith allyl chloride exposures below 25 mg/m\3\ for 1 to 4.5 years had fewneurological disorders, but 50 percent showed abnormal electroneuromyographicresults. Animal studies confirm this substance's neuropathic potential(Ex. 114A and Ex. 150, Comments on Allyl Chloride).The final rule establishes an 8-hour TWA limit of 1 ppm and a STEL of 2ppm for allyl chloride. The Agency concludes that both TWA and STEL limitsare necessary to protect workers from the significant risk of kidney andliver damage and neuropathic effects which constitute material health impairmentsand are potentially associated with the elevated short-term exposures toally chloride currently permitted by the 8-hour TWA alone.<ITAG tagnum="71">CARBON TETRABROMIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 558-13-4; Chemical Formula: CBr<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1072</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no limit for exposure to carbon tetrabromide. The proposedlimits were 0.1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 0.3 ppm as a 15-minute STEL; thefinal rule establishes these limits, which are consistent with those ofthe ACGIH. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with OSHA's proposed limitsfor carbon tetrabromide. At room temperature, pure carbon tetrabromideis a colorless, nonflammable solid. However, samples are usually yellow-brownin color. Carbon tetrabromide's hepatotoxic effects include both fatty infiltrationand necrosis. The 0.1-ppm and 0.3-ppm TWA and STEL levels were selectedbased on an observed no-effect level of 0.1 ppm; this finding derives froma study in which rats were exposed to carbon tetrabromide by inhalationfor seven hours per day, five days per week for six months (Torkelson andRowe 1981a/Ex. 1-974). Dr. Grace Ziem (Ex. 46) submitted information toOSHA showing that exposure to 0.07 ppm has caused sensory irritation inrats. The final rule establishes limits of 0.1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 0.3 ppmas a 15-minute STEL for carbon tetrabromide. OSHA concludes that establishingthese limits for this previously unregulated chemical will protect workersagainst the significant risk of hepatotoxic effects, which constitute materialhealth impairments. <ITAG tagnum="71">o-CHLOROSTYRENE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 2039-87-4; Chemical Formula: C<T2>8</T2>H<T2>7</T2>C1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1089</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no limit for o-chlorostyrene. The proposed limits werean 8-hour TWA of 50 ppm and a STEL of 75 ppm, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) concurred with these limits. The final rule establishes a 50-ppm TWAPEL and a 75-ppm STEL, limits that are consistent with those of the ACGIH.o-Chlorostyrene is a colorless liquid at room temperature. In an unpublished report, the Dow Chemical Company (1973a, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 136) describes the results of an o-chlorostyreneinhalation study in rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and dogs. Dow exposed theanimals to an average concentration of 101 ppm for seven hours daily, fivedays per week, for a total of 130 exposures in 180 days. No adverse effectswere observed in any species in terms of appearance, growth, behavior,mortality, hematology, BUN, alkaline phosphatase, SGPT, BSP, organ weights,or gross pathology (Dow Chemical Company 1973a, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 136). Microscopic examination of animal tissue revealed a somewhathigher incidence of pathological changes in the liver and kidneys. Thereis evidence indicating that the warning properties of o-chlorostyrene donot permit workers to be aware of o-chlorostyrene concentrations of 100ppm. Based on o-chlorostyrene's structural analogy to styrene, for whichshort-term exposure of 100 ppm have been demonstrated to produce neuropathicand narcotic effects (Stewart, Dodd, Baretta, and Schaffer 1968/Ex. 1-380),OSHA finds that a short-term limit is necessary. OSHA received no comments(other than NIOSH's) on this substance. The final rule establishes a PEL of 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and a 15-minuteSTEL of 75 ppm for o-cholorostyrene. The Agency concludes that both ofthese limits will protect workers from the significant risks of liver andkidney damage, narcosis, and neuropathy to which they could potentiallybe exposed in the absence of any OSHA limit. OSHA finds that these healtheffects constitute material health impairments and that the TWA and STELlimits will substantially reduce these significant occupational risks.<ITAG tagnum="71">CYCLOHEXANONE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-94-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>10</T2>O </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1108</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for cyclohexanone was 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. TheAgency proposed to reduce this limit to 25 ppm and to add a skin notationfor this substance. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposedlimit. The final rule establishes an 8-hour TWA PEL of 25 ppm and includesa skin notation. Both the ACGIH and NIOSH recommend a time-weighted averagefor cyclohexanone of 25 ppm, and the ACGIH also recommends a skin notation.Cyclohexanone is a white to pale yellow, oily liquid with an odor similarto that of acetone and peppermint. Cyclohexanone has been studied in several experimental animal species.A concentration of 2000 ppm inhaled for four hours was lethal to one ofsix rats; at 4000 ppm, all of the exposed animals died. In rabbits, thedermal LD<T2>50</T2> was 1000 mg/kg (Smyth, Carpenter, Weil et al. 1969/Ex. 1-442).Rabbits showed marked irritation and some corneal injury when undilutedcyclohexanone was instilled in the eye (Carpenter and Smyth 1946/Ex. 1-859).Guinea pigs exposed to 4000 ppm for six hours showed narcotic symptoms,lacrimation, salivation, depression of body temperature and heart rate,and corneal opacity (Specht, Miller, Valaer, and Sayers 1940/Ex. 1-1179).Rabbits exhibited degenerative changes of the liver and kidneys after 50daily six-hour inhalation exposures to 190 ppm (Treon, Crutchfield, andKitzmiller 1943b/Ex. 1-394). Exposures to 309 ppm cyclohexanone on thesame regimen caused conjunctival congestion, while exposures to 3000 ppmwere lethal to some of the exposed animals (Treon, Crutchfield, and Kitzmiller1943b/Ex. 1-394). In humans, Nelson and co-workers (1943/Ex. 1-66) reported that irritationcaused by exposure to cyclohexanone was intolerable at 50 ppm; however,25 ppm was not objectionable to most subjects in three- to five-minuteexposures (Nelson, Enge, Ross et al. 1943/Ex. 1-66). OSHA is adding a skin notation for cyclohexanone based on this substance'sability to cause systemic toxicity through dermal absorption. L.H. Hecker,Director of Corporate Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology at Abbott Laboratories,commented that, in his opinion, there was no evidence for cyclohexanone'sdermal toxicity, and thus that no skin notation was necessary (Ex. 3-678).However, OSHA has determined, based on a review of the evidence for thissubstance, that cyclohexanone has a dermal LD<T2>50</T2> of 100 mg/kg in rabbits (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials</T3>, 7th ed., p. 831,Sax and Lewis 1989). The Agency believes it appropriate to establish askin notation for substances posing a percutaneous hazard, which OSHA isdefining as any substance having a dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits of 1000 mg/kg or less. Accordingly, the Agency isincluding a skin notation for cyclohexanone in the final rule (see sectionVI.C.18 for a full discussion of the Agency's policy on skin notations).In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA for cyclohexanoneof 25 ppm, with a skin notation. The Agency has determined that these limitswill protect workers from the significant risks of liver and kidney damage,skin and respiratory-tract irritation, and percutaneous absorption associatedwith exposure to this substance. OSHA finds that skin and respiratory-tractirritation and liver and kidney damage all constitute material health impairments.<ITAG tagnum="71">DIOXANE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 123-91-1; Chemical Formula: 0(CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>)<T2>2</T2>0 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1145 </ITAG>OSHA's former PEL for dioxane was 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, with a skinnotation. The Agency proposed a 25-ppm 8-hour TWA PEL for this substance,with retention of the skin notation; these limits, which are consistentwith those of the ACGIH, are established in the final rule. NIOSH (Ex.8-47, Table N6A) agreed with the selection of this PEL. Dioxane is a colorlessliquid with an ethereal odor. A two-year drinking water study conducted by the Dow Chemical Company (1972b,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 217), in which male and female ratswere given water containing 1.0, 0.1, or 0.01 percent dioxane, showed thatanimals given the highest dose developed liver and nasal tumors, in additionto pathological changes in the liver and kidney. Rats in the 0.1-percentgroup showed renal tubular sloughing and hepatocellular degeneration butno significant increase in neoplasms. Because this study demonstrated hepato-and nephrotoxic effects at doses 10 times lower than the dose causing cancerin animals, the permissible exposure limit has been set at a level thatwill prevent dioxane's liver and kidney effects. A study by Torkelson etal. (1974/Ex. 1-111) in four species of animals exposed to multiple dailyairborne exposures of dioxane at 50 ppm showed no gross or histopathologicorgan changes; this study demonstrates that the 25-ppm level should protectagainst the risk of liver and kidney effects in exposed workers. Dioxanehas been shown in several studies to readily penetrate the skin of humansand animals and cause liver and kidney damage (NIOSH 1977n, p. 151, ascited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 218). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A; Tr. 3-96 to 3-97) concurs with OSHA's exposurelimit for dioxane, but notes its cancer potential. The AFL-CIO (Ex. 194,p. A12) also urged OSHA to designate dioxane as a carcinogen, as did theInternational Chemical Workers Union (Tr. 9-217 to 9-218). IARC (1987)has classified dioxane as a Group 2B (possible human) carcinogen basedon a finding of sufficient evidence in animals. OSHA is aware of the emergingliterature on dioxane's carcinogenic potential and intends to monitor thissubstance in the future. Thomas Robinson, representing Vulcan Chemicals, stated that it was ``mostappropriate'' for OSHA to adopt a TWA limit of 25 ppm for dioxane (Ex.3-677), and the Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance also supported OSHA'sproposed PELs. OSHA finds that the evidence for dioxane indicates that it is a liver andkidney toxin at levels substantially lower than those at which it producesa carcinogenic response. The Agency concludes that an 8-hour TWA of 25ppm for dioxane, with a skin notation, is necessary to protect exposedworkers against the significant risks of kidney and liver damage and cancer,all material health impairments that are associated with exposure at levelsabove the new PELs. OSHA has determined that the 25-ppm TWA limit willsubstantially reduce this risk. <ITAG tagnum="71">ETHYLENE DICHLORIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-06-2; Chemical Formula: C1CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>C1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1168 </ITAG>The former OSHA standard for ethylene dichloride (EDC) was 50 ppm as an8-hour TWA, with a 100-ppm STEL (maximum duration of five minutes in anythree hours) and a 200-ppm ceiling; these limits were derived from limitsrecommended by the American National Standards Institute in 1969. In 1980,the ACGIH reduced its TLV for ethylene dichloride to 10 ppm as an 8-hourTWA. NIOSH (1978q/Ex. 1-1120 and Ex. 8-47, Table N6A) has concluded thatethylene dichloride should be considered a potential human carcinogen andhas recommended a 1-ppm TWA REL and a 2-ppm 15-minute short-term limit.OSHA proposed an 8-hour TWA of 1 ppm and a STEL of 2 ppm, and the finalrule establishes these limits. Ethylene dichloride is a colorless liquidwith an odor typical of the chlorinated hydrocarbons. Several studies indicate that the former OSHA PELs are insufficient toprotect workers against the hepatotoxic and carcinogenic effects of exposureto EDC. A paper by Kozik (1957/Ex. 1-182) reported that workers generallyexposed to ethylene dichloride at levels of 10 to 15 ppm but occasionallyexposed to levels of 40 ppm experienced increased morbidity, diseases ofthe liver and bile ducts, and nervous system effects. In addition, Brzozowskiand associates (1954/Ex. 1-63) reported abnormal changes in the blood of50 percent of workers (8 of 16) exposed to EDC levels of 10 ppm and above(Brzozowski, Czajka, Dutkiewicz et al. 1954/Ex. 1-63). Many commenters submitted information to the docket on ethylene dichloride(Exs. 3-624, 3-677, 3-678, 3-741, 3-874, 3-1174, 8-47, and 150). Most commenterswere of the opinion that a permissible exposure limit of 10 ppm, ratherthan the proposed 1-ppm limit, would provide adequate protection againstEDC's hepatoxic, central nervous system, and hematopoietic effects (Exs.3-624, 3-677, 3-678, 3-741, 3-874, and 3-1174). Several of these participantsalso expressed concern about the feasibility of the 1-ppm limit (Exs. 3-624,3-741, and 3-874). The comments of Richard Olson, representing the DowChemical Company, were typical of those of this group of commenters. Accordingto Mr. Olson, OSHA's proposed limit was based on two outdated studies (Kozik1957/Ex. 1-182 and Brzozowski, Czajka, Dutkiewicz et al. 1954/Ex. 1-63)that are incomplete, reflect outdated work practices, and present resultsthat are based on effects caused by dermal as well as airborne exposures(Ex. 3-741, p. 52). The Chemical Manufacturers Association (Ex. 3-874)pointed out that the jobs being performed by the workers monitored in theBrzozowski et al. (1954/Ex. 1-63) study are no longer permitted becauseEPA has prohibited the use of EDC as a fumigant (Ex. 3-874). In response to these commenters, OSHA notes that there are many studiesreporting serious EDC-related effects among workers exposed to airborneconcentrations in the 10- to 15-ppm range. For example, the aircraft workersin the Kozik (1957/Ex. 1-182) study (average 8-hour TWA exposures of 10to 15 ppm) experienced increased morbidity and lost more workdays thandid non-EDC-exposed workers at the same factory. These workers experiencedhigh rates of gastrointestinal disease and liver and gallbladder diseases;these symptoms and diseases are typical EDC exposure effects. Another study(Cetnarowicz 1959) examined refinery workers exposed to EDC at levels rangingfrom 10 to 200 ppm and found that these workers experienced many of thesame symptoms as those seen in the aircraft workers. Clinical analysesconfirmed that the liver and gastrointestinal tract were the principaltarget organs affected by EDC exposure. Rosenbaum (1947) also reportedthat EDC exposures below 25 ppm (not further specified) caused functionalnervous system disorders, including headache, insomnia, and fatigue, andalso slowed the heartbeat rate in affected workers. OSHA finds the evidence presented in these studies consistent, biologicallyplausible, and convincing. Although specific exposure levels and preciseindustrial hygiene measurements are not available for some of these studies,the weight of the evidence presented demonstrates that occupational exposuresto EDC at levels of 10 ppm or somewhat higher (i.e., in the 14- to 15-ppmrange) cause severe health effects in specific target organ systems (i.e.,the liver and gastrointestinal tract). The symptoms and signs of EDC'seffects have been confirmed both clinically (palpitation of enlarged livers,X-ray evidence of pyloric spasms) and by laboratory analysis (elevatedurobilinogen levels, positive Takata-Ara liver function tests, negativeglucose tolerance tests). Thus, OSHA finds that EDC's hepatotoxic and gastrointestinaleffects clearly warrant a reduction in the PEL to levels substantiallybelow the level (10 ppm) shown to cause toxic liver and other effects.In response to the CMA, OSHA agrees that EPA's ban has eliminated the fumigantexposures described in the Brzozowski et al. (1954/Ex. 1-63) study, whichinvolved concomitant dermal exposures. However, OSHA notes that the dermalLD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is in the range of 2.8 to 4.9 g/kg, indicating thatEDC is not readily absorbed t hrough the skin in toxic quantities. OSHAtherefore finds that, although dermal exposure undoubtedly contributedsomewhat to the toxic effects seen in the workers in the Brzozowski etal. (1954/Ex. 1-63) study, airborne exposure was the predominant contributorto these effects.Some commenters also took issue with OSHA's reference in the proposal toEDC's carcinogenicity. According to these commenters (Exs. 3-677, 3-741,and 3-874), because the NCI bioassay (1978d/Ex. 1-947) in mice and ratsinvolved the use of corn oil as a vehicle, carcinogenic responses may havebeen enhanced. In addition, because EDC gavage produced greater amountsof the potentially genotoxic glutathione conjugate than did equivalentinhalation doses of EDC, these commenters believe that route of administrationmay play a critical role in the carcinogenicity of EDC, and thus, thatoccupational exposures, which are predominantly via inhalation, may notbe carcinogenic.  OSHA is aware that inhalation bioassays of EDC did not produce a statisticallysignificant increase in tumors in rats or mice. However, the NCI gavagestudy (1978d/Ex. 1-947) was positive in rats and mice, and intraperitonealadministration of EDC produced an elevated increase in lung adenomas instrain A mice (<T3>Health Assessment Document (HAD) for 1,2-Dichloroethane (Ethylene Dichloride</T3>),EPA/600/8-84/006F, p. 1-5, EPA 1985a). Dermal application caused a statisticallysignificant increase in benign lung tumors in mice, although this routedid not cause a significant increase in skin tumors. EPA (1985a) concludesthat the direct and supporting evidence for the carcinogenicity of EDCincludes:  (1) Multiple tumor types in oral bioassays in two species;  (2) Suggestive evidence in two other animal bioassays;  (3) Demonstrated evidence of reactive metabolites and formation of a DNAadduct; and  (4) Evidence that EDC is also a mutagen (EPA 1985a, p. 1-5).  In posthearing comments, NIOSH (Ex. 150, Comments on Ethylene Dichloride)emphasized that the NCI bioassay (NCI 1978d/Ex. 1-947) demonstrated EDC-inducedlung neoplasms and lymph system cancers in mice of both sexes, liver cancerin males, and mammary and uterine cancers in females. The AFL-CIO alsoemphasized EDC's carcinogenicity (Ex. 194). In rats, it produced cancersof the forestomach in males, mammary neoplasms in females, and hemangiosarcomasin animals of both sexes. NIOSH (Ex. 150, Comments on Ethylene Dichloride)concluded its comments by quoting the summary of the IARC (1979b, as citedin Ex. 150) monograph on EDC:<ITAG tagnum="21">There is sufficient evidence that ethylene dichloride is carcinogenicin mice and rats. In the absence of adequate data in humans, it is reasonablefor practical purposes to regard ethylene dichloride as if it presenteda carcinogenic risk to humans.</ITAG>In regard to the technological feasibility of achieving a 1-ppm limit forEDC, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) states that<ITAG tagnum="20">uniform compliance with the proposed PEL will not be achieved. Manufacturingoperations appear to be able to meet a 10-ppm, 8-hour TWA PEL for manyroutine operations. However, maintenance tasks, sampling, and loading operationswill have difficulty meeting a 10-ppm PEL (Ex. 3-874, p. 3).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Both the Vinyl Institute (Ex. 3-624) and the Dow Chemical Company(Ex. 3-741) share the CMA's view on the feasibility of achieving the 1-ppmlimit. However, OSHA notes that ethylene dichloride is manufactured andused in closed systems (Ex. 3-874) and that 90 percent of all EDC producedin this country is used captively by the producers themselves (84 percentof all EDC produced in the United States is used to make vinyl chloridemonomer) (EPA 1985a, p. 1-1). Emissions from closed systems, which includefugitive emissions from process equipment such as pumps, seals, and flanges;emissions during process sampling; emissions during loading operations;and emissions during maintenance operations, are all readily amenable tocontrol through the use of engineering methods or improved work practices.For example, implementation of a rigorous schedule of manual leak detectionand repair, the use of sampling bombs or ventilated sampling ports, theuse of loading arms for closed-hatch loading of EDC into railcars and tanktrucks, installation of vapor return lines or vapor recovery systems onloading docks, and installation of improved maintenance procedures areall inexpensive and effective methods of controlling fugitive emissionsfrom process machinery. In addition, because of the intermittent, nonroutine,and varied nature of maintenance operations, OSHA typically permits theuse of respirators during the performance of maintenance tasks. OSHA isalso cognizant of the potential for feasibility problems in loading andsampling operations. The Agency will consider the use of respirators forthese operations on a case-by-case basis or, as appropriate, on a sector-by-sectorbasis. However, OSHA finds that EDC producers will generally be able toachieve the 1-ppm 8-hour TWA and the 2-ppm short-term limit by using readilyavailable control technologies and implementing additional work practices. The Agency concludes that an 8-hour TWA of 1 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of2 ppm are necessary to protect workers against the significant risks ofliver damage, gastrointestinal toxicity, and cancer, all material healthimpairments that are associated with exposure to ethylene dichloride. OSHAfurther concludes that the revised limits will substantially reduce thesesignificant occupational risks.<ITAG tagnum="71">HYDRAZINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 302-01-2; Chemical Formula: H<T2>2</T2>N^NH<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1205</ITAG>The former OSHA limit for hydrazine was 1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, with askin notation. OSHA proposed an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.1 ppm, also with askin notation, and the final rule establishes this limit. Hydrazine isan odorless, fuming, oily liquid with an ammonia-like odor. Because ofhydrazine's potential carcinogenic hazard, NIOSH (1978e/Ex. 1-263; Ex.8-47) has recommended that workplace exposures to hydrazine not exceed0.03 ppm, as determined by a two-hour air sample; this level representsthe lowest detectable concentration over this sampling period.  A hepatotoxic response in mice and anemia and weight loss in dogs werereported to occur following a six-month exposure to 1 ppm of hydrazinefor six hours per day, five days per week, or to 0.2 ppm continuously (Haunand Kinkead 1973/Ex. 1-824). The ACGIH has assigned an A2 designation (suspecthuman carcinogen) to hydrazine, based on a study by MacEwen, Vernot, andHaun (1979/Ex. 1-193) showing significant increases in nasal tumors inrats exposed to 1 or 5 ppm hydrazine, in thyroid adenocarcinomas in ratsexposed to 5 ppm, and in lung adenomas among mice exposed to 1 ppm. NIOSH(1978e/Ex. 1-263) cites studies that demonstrate the carcinogenicity ofhydrazine in rodents by a variety of dose routes. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN6B) believes that hydrazine should be labelled a potential occupationalcarcinogen. Based on sufficient evidence of hydrazine's carcinogenicityin animals, IARC (1987) classified hydrazine as a Group 2B (possible human)carcinogen.The animal studies conducted by Haun and Kinkead (1973/Ex. 1-824) and byMacEwen. Vernot, and Haun (1979/Ex. 1-193) clearly demonstrate that exposureto hydrazine at the former 1-ppm PEL presents a significant risk of respiratorycancer, liver disease, and adverse blood effects; animals exposed to airborneconcentrations at this level have exhibited all of these responses. Reporteddermal LD<T2>50</T2>s in rabbits and dogs were 91 and 90 mg/kg, respectively, showingthat hydrazine can readily penetrate the skin and cause systemic effects.Some commenters (Ex. 8-16, 194, Tr. 9-218; Tr. 3-309) misunderstood theclassification scheme used by OSHA to group substances in the proposaland commented that, in their opinion, hydrazine should have been classifiedas a carcinogen rather than a hepatotoxin. However, as discussed in othersections of the preamble, OSHA did not intend this classification schemeto have regulatory implications but to facilitate generic rulemaking. OSHA'sapproach was to classify substances in accordance with the health effecton which the ACGIH has based its TLV. In response to the American IndustrialHygiene Association's question about a risk assessment for hydrazine, OSHAnotes that, in this rulemaking, OSHA has performed risk assessments onlyfor some of the substances classified in Section VI.C.15 of the preamble.The Agency is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.1 ppm, with a skin notation,for hydrazine. OSHA concludes that this limit will substantially reducethe significant risks of cancer, liver disease, and hematopoietic effects,all clearly material impairments of health, that have been demonstratedto occur in animals at exposures about the revised PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">METHYLCYCLOHEXANOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 25639-42-3; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>10</T2>OH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1269</ITAG>OSHA formerly had an 8-hour TWA limit of 100 ppm for methylcyclohexanol.The Agency proposed a limit of 50 ppm TWA for this substance, and is establishingthis limit in the final rule. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred withOSHA's proposed limits for methylcyclohexanol. Methylcyclohexanol is acolorless, viscous liquid with an aromatic odor, and usually exists asa mixture of isomers in which the meta and para forms predominate.Exposure to methylcyclohexanol produces liver and kidney impairment, narcoticeffects, and eye and respiratory irritation. Treon, Crutchfield, and Kitzmiller(1943a/Ex. 1-393) have reported the oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits to be between 1.25 and 2 g/kg; liver damage wasobserved in surviving animals. Repeated inhalation exposures to the vaporcaused salivation, eye irritation, and lethargy in rabbits exposed at 500ppm, but exposures to 230 ppm caused no observable effects. Fifty 6-hourexposures at a level of 120 ppm caused microscopic changes in the liverand kidney tissue of rabbits (Treon, Crutchfield, and Kitzmiller 1943b/Ex.1-394).In humans, headaches and eye and respiratory irritation have been reportedto occur following prolonged exposures to high concentrations of methylcyclohexanol(Fillipi 1914, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 385). Smyth (1956/Ex.1-759) considered an exposure limit of 100 ppm to be sufficiently low toprevent narcotic effects and, perhaps, significant liver or kidney damage.OSHA received no comments (other than NIOSH's) on this substance.The Agency is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 50 ppm for methylcyclohexanol.OSHA concludes that this limit will protect workers against the significantrisks of hepatic and renal damage and narcosis, which constitute materialhealth impairments and are associated with exposures to this substanceat levels above the revised PEL. The Agency finds that the revised limitwill substantially reduce these risks.<ITAG tagnum="71">OCTACHLORONAPHTHALENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 2234-13-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>10</T2>Cl<T2>8</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1295</ITAG>OSHA formerly had a limit of 0.1 mg/m\3\ TWA, with a skin notation, foroctachloronaphthalene. The Agency proposed to retain the 8-hour TWA andto add a STEL of 0.3 mg/m\3\, also with a skin notation, for this substance,and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred. These limits are establishedin the final rule. Octachloronaphthalene is a nonflammable, pale yellow,waxy solid containing 70 percent chlorine.Inhalation toxicity data for octachloronaphthalene fumes or dust are lacking,but exposure to the chloronaphthalenes causes acne-like lesions that itchseverly. Repeated exposures to the fumes of molten chlorinated naphthalenescan cause severe and sometimes fatal systemic poisoning and are especiallydamaging to the liver (Patty 1963g/Ex. 1-845). Ingestion studies of cattlehave shown different toxicities for different naphthalenes, with toxicityincreasing with the compound's degree of chlorination (Sikes, Wise, andBridges 1952/Ex. 1-804). However, these data are controverted by anotherreport in which octachloronaphthalene was found to be less toxic than thehexachloro derivative (Bell 1953/Ex. 1-951). This divergence in the datamay be due to differing methods of administration (suspension versus solution),or may reflect the soluble form's greater capacity for absorption (ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 447). NIOSH was the only submitter of comments specificallyrelating to octachloronaphthalene.In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.1 mg/m\3\and adding a STEL of 0.3 mg/m\3\, with a skin notation, for octachloronaphthalene.The Agency concludes that this combined limit will protect workers againstthe significant risks of serious liver damage and dermal lesions, whichconstitute material health impairments and are associated with exposureto this substance at the elevated levels permitted by an 8-hour limit alone.The skin notation is retained because of octachloronaphthalene's demonstratedability to cause systemic toxicity by percutaneous absorption.<ITAG tagnum="71">PROPYLENE DICHLORIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 78-87-5; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CHClCH<T2>2</T2>Cl</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1341</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for propylene dichloride was 75 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.The proposal retained the 75-ppm TWA and added a STEL of 110 ppm, and theseare the limits being promulgated in the final rule. Propylene dichlorideis a colorless, flammable, mobile liquid with an odor like that of chloroform.The primary hazards associated with exposure to propylene dichloride areinhalation-induced toxicity to liver tissue and skin and eye irritation.Repeated inhalation exposures to 1000 ppm have been reported to kill dogs(after 24 exposures), guinea pigs (after 22 exposures), and rats (in somecases after only seven exposures); however, some animals survived morethan 100 seven-hour exposures. Necropsy showed severe liver damage; thehepatotoxicity of propylene dichloride appears to be greater than thatof carbon tetrachloride and less than that of ethylene dichloride (Heppel,Neal, Highman, and Porterfield 1946/Ex. 1-510). Animals of these same species(rats, dogs, and guinea pigs) survived 128 to 140 seven-hour exposuresto 400 ppm propylene dichloride for five days/week without histologic effects,while mice died from similar exposures; surviving mice displayed hepatomas(Heppel, Highman, and Peake 1948/Ex. 1-605). The oral LD<T2>50</T2> for rats has been reported as 1.19 ml/kg (Smyth, Carpenter,Weil et al. 1969/Ex. 1-442); the acute 8-hour inhalation LC<T2>50</T2> for rats is 3000 ppm (Pozzani, Weil, and Carpenter 1959/Ex.1-608). NIOSH (Ex. 150A, Comments on Propylene Dichloride) noted that anNTP (1986c) bioassay showed some evidence that propylene dichloride wascarcinogenic in mice and caused an increased incidence of hepatocellularadenomas; NIOSH indicated (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B) that a separate 6(b) rulemakingmight be appropriate for this substance. The finding of tumors was notreproduced in rats, in that female rats showed only a marginally increasedincidence of mammary adenocarcinomas, and male rats showed no response.NIOSH was the only commenter on propylene dichloride.In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA PEL for propylene dichlorideof 75 ppm and adding a 15-minute STEL of 110 ppm. The Agency concludesthat this combined limit will protect workers against the significant risksof serious hepatotoxic effects, which constitute material impairments ofhealth, that are associated with exposures at the elevated levels permittedby the absence of a short-term limit. OSHA finds that the TWA and short-termPELs will act together to reduce this risk substantially.<ITAG tagnum="71">1,1,2,2-TETRACHLOROETHANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 79-34-5; Chemical Formula: CHCl<T2>2</T2>CHCL<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1385</ITAG>OSHA's former PEL for 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane was 5 ppm as an 8-hourTWA, with a skin notation; a 1-ppm 8-hour TWA, also with a skin notation,was the level proposed by OSHA. NIOSH considers 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethaneto be a potential carcinogen but concurred with the limit proposed (Ex.8-47, Table N6A). The final rule establishes a PEL of 1 ppm. TWA and retainsthe skin notation for this colorless, nonflammable, heavy, mobile liquidwith a sweet, chloroform-like odor.One study by Jeney, Bartha, Kondor, and Szendrei (1957, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 561) revealed identifiably adverse effects on the liver,including hepatitis, in humans exposed to concentrations of tetrachloroethaneranging from 1.5 to 247 ppm; liver damage was still evident after exposureswere reduced to 15 ppm. An animal study by Schmidt, Binnewies, Gohlke,and Rothe (1972/Ex. 1-222) found ``barely detectable'' fatty infiltrationof the liver in rats exposed to 2 ppm tetrachloroethane for 11 months.The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 561) cites some early studies that show thattetrachloroethane penetrates human skin; one fatality has been attributedto excess skin absorption. The New Jersey Department of Public Health (Ex.144) urged OSHA to set the PEL for this substance on the basis of EPA'sIRIS data. The use of IRIS data is discussed in Section VI.A.Based on this evidence, OSHA concludes that the former permissible exposurelimit does not protect exposed workers against fatty infiltration of theliver or against more serious liver damage; these health consequences clearlyconstitute material health impairments and thus pose a significant occupationalrisk. OSHA finds that reducing the 8-hour TWA for 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethaneto 1 ppm will substantially reduce this significant risk, and in the finalrule, OSHA is therefore establishing a 1 ppm 8-hour TWA, with a skin notation,for 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane.<ITAG tagnum="71">1,2,3-TRICHLOROPROPANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 96-18-4; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>ClCHClCH<T2>2</T2>Cl</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1407</ITAG>OSHA's former PEL for 1,2,3-trichloropropane was 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA,and the proposed limit was a 10 ppm TWA with a skin notation. NIOSH (Ex.8-47, Table N6A) concurred with the proposed limit but indicated that itconsiders this substance to be a potential human carcinogen. The finalrule establishes the 10 ppm TWA but does not include a skin notation. 1,2,3-Trichloropropaneis a colorless to straw-colored, combustible liquid with an odor similarto that of chloroform.1,2,3-Trichloropropane is not irritating to intact skin; it is also notreadily absorbed through the skin. The dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 1770 mg/kg (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>7th ed., p. 173,Sax and Lewis 1989). However, 1,2,3-trichloropropane is highly irritatingto the eyes (Smyth, Carpenter, Weil et al. 1962/Ex. 1-441). Five of sixrats exposed to 1000 ppm died after four-hour exposures. Rats and guineapigs exposed at 800, 2100, or 5000 ppm for 30 minutes showed central nervoussystem depression, which progressed, at the higher exposure levels, tonarcosis and convulsions (Lewis 1979, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.601). Several mice exposed for 20 minutes to 5000 ppm died, some as longas several days later, from liver damage. Daily 10-minute exposures at2500 ppm for 10 days killed 7 of 10 mice (McOmie and Barnes 1949, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 601). Animals exposed once for four hours to1,2,3-trichloropropane at concentrations of 125, 340, 700, or 2150 ppmshowed dose-related signs of irritation, which included, at 700 or 2150ppm, labored respiration, inactivity, and eye and nose irritation; at autopsy,however, no organ or other damage was apparent (McOmie and Barnes 1949,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 601).Drew, Patel, and Lin (1978/Ex. 1-313) noted changes in liver enzymes aftera single four-hour exposure to 500 ppm, and Russian studies indicate thatmorphologic changes and metabolic lesions of the liver, kidney, and lungsoccurred in mice exposed continuously to 1,2,3-trichloropropane concentrationsof 0.007 to 0.3 ppm (Sidorenko, Tsulaya, Bonashevskaya, and Shaipak 1979/Ex.1-669; Sidorenko, Tsulaya, Koreneveskaya, and Bonashevskaya 1976/Ex. 1-668;Tsulaya, Bonashevskaya, Zykova et al. 1977/Ex. 1-450.A National Toxicology Program (NTP) prechronic study, in which rats weregavaged daily with 1,2,3-trichloropropane at 8, 16, 32, 63, 125, and 250mg/kg body weight for 120 days, showed good survival in all but the highestdose group (NTP 1983a, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 602). Statisticallysignificant changes in the liver and kidneys, as well as necrosis and irritationof the nasal passages, occurred in the 63- and 125-mg/kg dose groups. Decreasesin red blood cell counts and hematocrits were also seen, even in the 16mg/kg dose group. 1,2,3-Trichloropropane did not affect testicular weight,sperm count, or morphology. The NTP found this substance to be geneticallyactive in three bioassays. Hardin, Bond, Sikov et al. (1981/Ex. 1-699)did not find 1,2,3-trichloropropane to be fetotoxic or teratogenic.Human volunteers found exposure to 1,2,3-trichloropropane objectionablebecause of eye and upper respiratory tract irritation, and many found 50ppm an unacceptable level for a full-shift exposure (Silverman, Schulte,and First 1946/Ex. 1-142).The Agency has determined that 1,2,3-trichloropropane's dermal toxicityis not such as to warrant a skin notation; OSHA's reasoning in regard toskin notations is discussed in Section VI.C.18 of this preamble.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 8-hour PEL of 10 ppm for 1,2,3-trichloropropane.The Agency concludes that the 10-ppm 8-hour TWA limit is necessary to protectworkers against the significant risks of liver and kidney damage and eyeand throat irritation, all of which constitute material health impairmentsthat are potentially associated with exposures to this substance at levelsabove the revised PEL.<ITAG tagnum="84">Kidney Toxicity</ITAG>IntroductionKidney damage is the basis for revising the PELs for five of the compoundsin this group. These compounds, their CAS and HS numbers, and their former,proposed, and final rule PELs, are shown in Table C4-2. Three of thesesubstances will be regulated by OSHA for the first time, and in the othertwo cases, the 8-hour TWA will be reduced. In one of the latter cases,a STEL will also be added.Description of the Health EffectsThe precise mechanism by which these chemicals damage the kidneys is unknown.Typically, these compounds are selectively toxic to cells in the renaltubules, perhaps because impaired transport causes the chemical to collectin these cells. In addition to its function in the excretion of wastes,the kidney plays an important role in the regulation of total body homeostasis.This organ regulates extracellular volume, controls electrolyte and acid-basebalance, and forms several hormones that control systemic metabolism. Dependingon their particular site of action, nephrotoxicants can interfere withhydration, the proper excretion of the body's wastes, electrolytic balance,metabolism, or the maintenance of correct acid-base balances.Like the hepatotoxic effects previously described, the least severe lesionscaused by nephrotoxic compounds are graded and reversible. The earliestchanges are usually alterations in the activities of specific enzymes inthe tubular cells. These changes may be accompanied by minor morphologicalalterations of the cells that are visible only with an electron microscope.Higher doses or more sustained exposures are required to cause cellularnecrosis that might be visible with light microscopy. Because of the reservecapacity of the kidneys, a significant degree of tubular cell necrosismust occur before it is reflected by measurable alterations in kidney function.Thus, indicators of impaired renal function that can be measured in humans,such as proteinuria, glucosuria, and increased BUN, are relatively insensitiveindicators of kidney damage. Other indicators of significant kidney damageinclude increased kidney weight, swelling of the tubular epithelium, fattydegeneration of tubular epithelium, and the presence of tubular casts inthe urine.Dose-Response CharacteristicsKidney damage, like liver damage, is progressive; only at the earlier stagesare nephrotoxic effects reversible. With continued exposure, the damagebecomes more extensive, until it reaches the point at which it cannot berepaired. The toxicity of the kidney-damaging chemicals included in thisgroup also increases as dose increases. For most nephrotoxins, there appearsto be a NOEL. Workplace exposures to concentrations of these substancesat levels at or below the revised limits are unlikely to cause kidney effectsin most workers. OSHA has determined that the nephrotoxic risks being protectedagainst are significant at the former PELs; kidney damage constitutes amaterial health impairment within the meaning of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="71">1,3-DICHLOROPROPENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 542-75-6; CHEMICAL FORMULA: CHC1=CH^CH<T2>2</T2>C1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1129</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no limit for 1,3-dichloropropene. The Agency proposedan 8-hour TWA of 1 ppm, with a skin notation, for this straw-colored, clearliquid with a chloroform-like odor. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A) concurredwith the proposed limit, which is established in the final rule. This compoundoccurs in two forms: cis- and trans-isomers.In male and female rats, the acute oral LD<T2>50</T2>s for a 92-percent mixture of the cis- and trans-isomers of1,3-dichloropropene were 713 and 470 mg/kg, respectively; postmortem examinationshowed liver and kidney damage and evidence of possible lung injury (Torkelsonand Oyen 1977/Ex. 1-532). The dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits for a 92-percent undiluted mixture was 504 mg/kg,but a 10-percent solution administered by gavage at a dose of 125 or 250mg/kg was lethal to some of the animals (Torkelson and Oyen 1977/Ex. 1-532).Contact with the liquid was irritating to the eyes and skin of rabbits(Torkelson and Oyen 1977/Ex. 1-532).Inhalation exposures to 1,3-dichloropropene vapor concentrations above2700 ppm produced eye and nasal irritation and severe lung, nasal, kidney,and liver damage in rats (Torkelson and Oyen 1977/Ex. 1-532). Exposureto 1000 ppm caused eye and nasal irritation, lacrimation, and, if prolonged,unconsciousness; rats exposed to 1000 ppm for two hours died, but thoseexposed for one hour survived (Torkelson and Oyen 1977/Ex. 1-532). Guineapigs exposed to 400 ppm for a single seven-hour period died, while ratsexposed similarly survived but had obvious lung congestion (Torkelson andOyen 1977/Ex. 1-532). Rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and dogs were exposedseven hours/day, five days/week for six months to 1-ppm or 3-ppm concentrationsof 1,3-dichloropropene (Torkelson and Oyen 1977/Ex. 1-532). No adverseeffects were observed in any of the animals exposed at 1 ppm. Of the animalsexposed at 3 ppm, only male rats showed adverse effects; these animalshad reversible cloudy swelling of the renal tubular epithelium (Torkelsonand Oyen 1977/Ex. 1-532).In humans, acute exposures to 1,3-dichloropropene cause skin, eye, andrespiratory irritation (Torkelson and Oyen 1977/Ex. 1-532). There are nodata on the effects in humans of chronic exposure to this substance. NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N6A; Tr. 3-96 to 3-97) concurs with the limits being establishedby OSHA but notes that 1,3-dichloropropene could be classified as a potentialoccupational carcinogen. The New Jersey Department of Public Health urgedOSHA to derive a PEL for this substance based on EPA's IRIS data. The useof such data is discussed in Section VI.A.OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 1 ppm, with a skin notation,for 1,3-dichloropropene. The Agency concludes that this limit will protectworkers against the significant risks of eye and mucous membrane irritationand lung, kidney, and liver damage, all of which constitute material healthimpairments that are associated with exposure to this substance. A skinnotation is established to protect against 1,3-dichloropropene's abilityto cause systemic toxicity when absorbed through the skin.<ITAG tagnum="71">DICYCLOPENTADIENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 77-73-6; Chemical Formula: C<T2>10</T2>H<T2>12</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1132</ITAG>OSHA had no former limit for dicyclopentadiene (DCPD); the proposed limitwas a TWA of 5 ppm, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with thislimit. The final rule establishes a 5-ppm 8-hour TWA PEL for this substance,which is consistent with the ACGIH's limit. DCPD is a solid at room temperatureand has a disagreeable odor.The health effects associated with exposure to DCPD include mild eye, skin,and respiratory irritation, as well as renal damage and possible pulmonarydamage. By the oral and intrapertioneal routes, DCPD is extremely toxic,with an oral LD<T2>50</T2> value of 0.35 ml/kg and an intrapertioneal LD<T2>50</T2> value of 0.31 ml/kg in rats; rat fatalities occurred within60 minutes of exposure to an unspecified concentration of the saturatedvapor (Kinkead, Pozzani, Geary, and Carpenter 1971/Ex. 1-606). However,Gage (1970/Ex. 1-508) regards approximately 660 ppm as the 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> in rats and reports that 10 six-hour daily exposures to DCPDat a concentration of 250 ppm were survived only by three of four rats;when the animals were subjected to a concentration of 100 ppm for 15 similarexposures, all survived (Gage 1970/Ex. 1-318). Although other species wereless susceptible than mice to the effects of DCPD exposure, they exhibitedeye irritation, incoordination, and convulsions preceding death (Kinkead,Pozzani, Geary, and Carpenter 1971/Ex. 1-606).Kinkead and associates (1971/Ex. 1-606) report that rats exposed repeatedlyfor 10 days survived concentrations of 72 or 146 ppm but succumbed at the332-ppm level, with convulsions, lung hemorrhage, and blood in the intestines;female rats also suffered hemorrhage of the thymus. Mice similarly exposedsuccumbed at all three concentration levels (Kinkead, Pozzani, Geary, andCarpenter 1971/Ex. 1-606). Chronic exposures of seven hours/day for 89days produced kidney damage and some pulmonary effects in rats exposedat levels of 35 and 74 ppm; the no-effect level for these endpoints inrats was determined to be below 19.7 ppm. Dogs exposed at concentrationsof 9, 23, or 32 ppm on the same regimen exhibited only minimal effects(Kinkead, Pozzani, Geary, and Carpenter 1971/Ex. 1-606).Human sensory response tests resulted in findings of mild eye and throatirritation within seven minutes' exposure to 1 ppm DCPD vapor, and of olfactoryfatigue within 24 minutes; a 30-minute exposure to 5.5 ppm produced noolfactory fatigue (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p 194). Subjective complaints ofheadache during the first two months of occupational exposure disappearedduring the following three months of exposure, suggesting a developed tolerancefor this substance (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 194). No comments (other thanNIOSH's) on this substance were received.OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 5 ppm TWA for dicyclopentadiene.The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workers against the significantrisks of kidney injury, pulmonary effects, and irritation, which constitutematerial health impairments that are associated with workplace exposureto DCPD at levels above the new PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">ETHYL SILICATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 78-10-4; Chemical Formula: Si(OC<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>)<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1166</ITAG>OSHA's former permissible exposure limit for ethyl silicate was 100 ppmas an 8-hour TWA. The proposal included a limit of 10 ppm TWA for thiscolorless, flammable liquid with a faint odor; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1)agreed with the selection of this limit. In the final rule, a PEL of 10ppm is established for ethyl silicate; this limit is consistent with thatof the ACGIH.Ethyl silicate has been reported to cause both irritation and systemictoxicity. In guinea pigs and rats, a 60-minute exposure of 2000 ppm wasreported as the maximal duration/concentration that did not cause seriousdisturbances; 500 ppm was the maximal no-effect exposure level for an exposureof several hours' duration (Smyth and Seaton 1940b/Ex. 1-376). Thirty-dayexposures to 400 ppm ethyl silicate for seven hours/day caused significantmortality in rats and damage to the lungs, liver, and kidney in the survivinganimals. Exposures of rats, guinea pigs, and mice to 88, 50, or 23 ppmfor 90 days (seven hours/day, five days/week) resulted only in decreasedkidney weights in mice exposed at the 88-ppm level (Pozzani and Carpenter1951/Ex. 1-166). In another study, Kasper, McCord, and Fredrick (1937/Ex.1-1155) showed that animals exposed to 164 ppm ethyl silicate for 17 eight-hourdays showed less weight gain than did controls. Rowe and associates (1948/Ex.1-359) reported that three 7-hour exposures at 1000 ppm were fatal to 4of 10 rats; similar exposures to 500 ppm caused pronounced kidney changesand slight lung irritation. Four to 10 similar exposures at 250 ppm causedslow weight loss and some lung and renal changes; at 125 ppm, slight tomoderate kidney damage was observed (Rowe, Spencer, and Bass 1948/Ex. 1-359).Smyth and Seaton (1940b/Ex. 1-376) reported that exposure to a concentrationof 1200 ppm causes lacrimation in humans and that 250 ppm causes eye andnose irritation. Only NIOSH submitted comments to the rulemaking recordon ethyl silicate.OSHA is establishing a PEL for ethyl silicate of 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.The Agency concludes that this limit is required to protect workers fromthe significant risk of renal damage, which constitutes material healthimpairment, that is associated with exposures to this substance at concentrationsabove the revised PEL. OSHA finds that this reduced limit will substantiallyreduce this risk.<ITAG tagnum="71">HEXACHLOROBUTADIENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 87-68-3; Chemical Formula: CCl<T2>2</T2>=CCl^CCl=CCl<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1195</ITAG>OSHA had no former limit for hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD); the proposal includeda PEL of 0.02 ppm and a skin notation for this substance. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47,Table N6A) supported the selection of this limit. the ACGIH recommendsa TLV-TWA of 0.02 ppm with a skin notation and classifies this substanceas a suspected human carcinogen (A2). The final rule establishes an 8-hourTWA of 0.02 ppm but does not include a skin notation. Hexachlorobutadieneis a heavy, clear liquid.Hexachlorobutadiene has a moderate-to-high acute oral toxicity. The LD<T2>50</T2>s reported for mice, rats, and guinea pigs are 87, 350, and90 mg/kg, respectively (Murzakev 1963, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 298). Gul'ko and co-workers (1964/Ex/ 1-1082) reported LD<T2>50</T2> values of 116 mg/kg for mice and 270 mg/kg for rats (Gul'ko,Zimina, and Shroit 1964/Ex. 1-1082). The dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 1211 kg/mg <T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>6th ed., p. 2145,Sax 1984). A single exposure of 133 to 150 ppm via inhalation has beenfatal in rats when the exposure lasts for four to seven hours. All ratssurvived exposures at 161 ppm for 0.88 hour or 34 ppm for 3.3 hours; similarexposure of guinea pigs and cats to the same concentrations resulted inthe death of most animals (Kociba, Schwetz, Keyes et al. 1977/Ex. 1-494).Another inhalation study in rats showed eye and nose irritation, respiratorydifficulty, and damage to kidney tissue and the adrenal cortex after two4-hour exposures at 250 ppm; twelve 6-hour exposures to 100 ppm causedeye and nose irritation, respiratory difficulty, weight loss, anemia inthe female animals, and kidney and adrenal damage; fifteen 6-hour exposuresat 25 ppm caused retarded weight gain in females, respiratory difficulty,and kidney damage; fifteen 6-hour exposures at 10 ppm caused retarded weightgain in females but no systemic injury; and fifteen 6-hour exposures at5 ppm resulted in no adverse effects (Gage 1970/Ex. 1-318).Reproductive studies in male and female rats demonstrated multiple toxicologicaleffects, including kidney damage in both sexes and increased liver weightin males, at the high-dose level of 20 mg/kg/day. Dietary administrationof 20, 2, or 0.2 mg/kg daily had no effect on conception percentages, gestationalsurvival, neonatal survival, neonatal sex ratios, neonatal morphology,or neonatal body weights (except for the high-dose neonates) (Schwetz,Smith, Humiston et al. 1977/Ex. 1-368). Results of lifetime dietary studiessuggest that the no-effect level for hexachlorobutadiene in rats is 0.2mg/kg/day, that a clear dose-response relationship exists for HCBD-inducedtoxicity affecting primarily the kidney, and that carcinogenic effects(i.e., renal neoplasms) result from ingestion of 20 mg/kg/day (Kociba,Schwetz, Keyes et al. 1977/Ex. 1-494). These authors also reported thatHCBD-induced neoplasms occur only at HCBD doses higher than those causingdiscernible renal injury. The ACGIH states that ``HCBD would seem to qualifyas a carcinogen of intermediate potency'' (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 299).NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A) concurs with the limit being established byOSHA and notes that this substance could be classified as a potential occupationalcarcinogen.OSHA is not including a skin notation in the final rule. This decisionis based on the Agency's policy in the matter of skin notations (see SectionVI.C.18 of the preamble for a discussion of this issue). OSHA is establishingan 8-hour TWA limit of 0.02 ppm for this hazardous substance. Assuminga 10-m3 per day breathing volume per 8-hour workshift and a 70-kg bodyweight for humans, this limit corresponds to a daily hexachlorobutadieneintake of approximately 0.03 mg/kg, which is about 10 times below the observedno-effect level in rats fed hexachlorobutadiene. The Agency concludes thatthis 0.02-ppm limit will protect workers exposed to HCBD from the significantrisks of kidney damage; eye, skin, and pulmonary irritation; and renalneoplasms, all of which constitute material health impairments that areassociated with exposure to HCBD at levels above the new limit.<ITAG tagnum="71">HEXONE (METHYL ISOBUTYL KETONE)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-10-1; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>COCH<T2>2</T2>CH(CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1203</ITAG>OSHA's former 8-hour TWA limit for hexone (methyl isobutyl ketone), orMIBK, was 100 ppm. The ACGIH has established a TLV-TWA of 50 ppm and a15-minute STEL of 75 ppm for this substance. NIOSH recommends a TWA of50 ppm for MIBK, which is a clear liquid with a characteristic ketone odor.OSHA proposed a 50-ppm 8-hour TWA and a 75-ppm STEL, and the final ruleestablishes these limits. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with theAgency's selection of these limits.A four-hour exposure to 4000 ppm MIBK killed all exposed rats, but a similarexposure to 2000 ppm was not fatal to these animals (Smyth, Carpenter,and Weil 1951/Ex. 1-439). Guinea pigs exposed to a MIBK concentration of10,000 ppm immediately showed signs of irritation (Specht, Miller, Valaer,and Sayers 1940/Ex. 1-1179).MacEwen, Vernot, and Haun (1971/Ex. 1-194) exposed rats, mice, dogs, andmonkeys to 100 or 200 ppm MIBK for two weeks and noted no signs of intoxication;however, rats exposed to 100 ppm had heavier kidneys and higher kidney-to-body-weightratios, and, at 200 ppm, livers were heavier as well. Postmortem examinationrevealed nephrosis of the proximal tubules.The same authors (MacEwen, Vernot, and Haun 1971/Ex. 1-194), exposed rhesusmonkeys, dogs, and rats continuously for 90 days to MIBK concentrationsof 100 ppm. These authors observed no significant changes in clinical chemistryor blood test results, although the rats had heavier kidneys and livers,reversible hyaline droplet degeneration of the proximal tubules of thekidneys, and some necrosis of the tubules.Silverman, Schulte, and First (1946/Ex. 1-142) determined that the maximumdose of MIBK tolerable to human volunteers for eight hours was 100 ppm;at 200 ppm, these subjects found the odor of MIBK objectionable and thevapor irritating. Linari and co-workers (1964/Ex. 1-1159) reported thatmore than half of all workers exposed to 500 ppm of MIBK for 20 to 30 minutesdaily, and perhaps to 80 ppm for the remainder of the shift, experiencedweakness, loss of appetitie, headache, burning eyes, nausea, vomiting,and sore throat; several of these workers also reported insomnia, somnolence,heartburn, and intestinal pain. Some workers had enlarged livers and othershad colitis. Clinical test results on these workers were normal (Linari,Perrelli, and Varese 1964/Ex. 1-1159).In a follow-up study on this same group of centrifuge operation workers;Armeli and co-workers (1968/Ex. 1-1028) determined that reduction of MIBKlevels (during the 15 to 30 minutes of centrifuge operation) to 100 to105 ppm, and (for the remainder of the shift) to 50 ppm had also significantlyreduced the symptomatology reported earlier by these workers. However,liver enlargement persisted in two workers, and a few workers continuedto report gastrointestinal and nervous system effects (Armeli, Linari,and Martorano 1968/Ex. 1-1028).Elkins (1959/Ex. 1-734) noted that exposure to 100 ppm during boot-waterproofingoperations caused workers to develop headache and nausea; another similarlyexposed group experienced only irritation at 100 ppm.The AFL-CIO (Ex. 194) commented on MIBK. The AFL-CIO supports the limitsOSHA has established for this substance in the final rule.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 50 ppm and a 15-minuteSTEL of 75 ppm for hexone. The Agency concludes that these limits willwork together to protect workers from the significant risks of headache,nausea, and irritation, as well as the potential kidney and liver effectsthat constitute material health impairments that are associated with exposuresto hexone above the revised PELs.Conclusion for Both Liver and Kidney ToxinsThe health effects associated with occupational exposures to the hepato-and nephrotoxins shown in Tables C4-1 and C4-2 can be acute or chronic,reversible or irreversible, temporarily disabling or threatening to life.Workers experiencing chemically induced hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic effectsmay have enlarged livers, high blood pressure, hormonal imbalances, and/ororgan necrosis, all of which constitute material impairments of healthor functional capacity within the meaning of the Act. In addition, exposureto the substances in this grouping is associated with a host of other adversehealth effects, ranging from pulmonary irritation to cancer, and OSHA concludesthat the new or revised limits will substantially reduce the risk of theseeffects as well.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Ocular Effects</ITAG>IntroductionFive of the chemicals for which OSHA is establishing limits have the potentialto cause serious ocular effects in the workplace setting. Certain chemicalsin this group are also sensory irritants and have been classified separatelyfrom the other irritants only because of their ability to cause permanentdamage to the corneas, lenses, or optic nerves of exposed individuals.Table C5-1 lists these five chemicals, along with OSHA's former, proposed,and final rule PELs, and each chemical's CAS number and HS number. ForN-ethyl morpholine, the former 8-hour TWA of 20 ppm has been reduced to5 ppm; the skin notation has been retained. For methyl alcohol and naphthalene,OSHA has retained its former 8-hour TWA and added a STEL (in the case ofmethyl alcohol, a skin notation has been added as well). For methyl silicate,the Agency has promulgated a new 8-hour PEL, while for hydrogen sulfide,the former STEL of 20 ppm and ceiling of 50 ppm have been replaced witha 10-ppm 8-hour TWA, supplemented by a 15-ppm short-term exposure limit.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-25-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 628</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Description of the Health EffectsDamage to the eye caused by exposure to the chemicals in this group canoccur in the form of corneal, lens, retinal, ganglion cell layer, or opticnerve effects. Depending on the severity of the exposure, individual susceptibility,and the particular chemical and circumstances involved, this damage maybe transient, temporarily disabling, or permanently blinding.<T3>Corneal effects.</T3> The cornea and conjunctiva are the outer surfacesof the eye and are thus directly exposed to external insults. Since thecornea must maintain transparency to remain functional, scar formationafter injury to the cornea can destroy visual function completely. Recentevidence suggests that the transparency of the cornea is maintained bythin inner and outer boundary layers and that the death of these layersleads to loss of transparency (Potts 1986/Ex. 1-174). The corneal epithelium(outer layer) sometimes regenerates, depending on the depth of the burnor insult and the nature of the toxicant.Some chemicals, including methyl silicate, produce painful corneal epithelialinjuries that have a delayed symptom onset. These substances can continueto cause pain and loss of corneal epithelial cells for several hours afterexposure. Typically, there is no discomfort during the actual exposure,but several hours later, the eyes begin to burn, vision blurs, and conjunctivalhyperemia, tearing, photophobia, and squinting occur (Grant 1986/Ex. 1-975).Possible mechanisms of action are enzyme inhibition, denaturing of otherproteins, alteration of the DNA, and interference with the mitotic process;after a period of exposure, the affected cells die. Although the damagedepithelium sometimes regenerates after this type of injury, the damagecan also involve the corneal stroma and endothelium, leading to scarring,vascularization, opacity, and loss of vision. The poor warning propertiescharacteristic of these substances (i.e., their failure to cause an immediateresponse) make the establishment of protective exposure limits particularlyimportant.Exposure to the vapors of some of the substances in this group producespainless edema of the corneal epithelium, which can be accompanied by thedelayed onset of visual haloes. A chemical that produces these effectsis N-ethylmorpholine, a catalyst used to manufacture urethane foam. Painlessedema generally occurs in workers who have been exposed for several hoursto levels that do not produce discomfort during the exposure itself. Thevisual effect produced by such exposures consists of the appearance ofcolored haloes around lights, an effect that is caused by the diffractionof light through the swollen epithelial cells of the eye. Visual haloesare severely distracting and restrict activity substantially, and the mechanismunderlying this effect is not well understood (Grant 1986/Ex. 1-975).<T3>Lens effects. </T3>The lens is a transparent, avascular tissue surroundedby a thin, collagenous capsule. The major portion of the lens is composedof long, thin fibers that form closely packed, onion-like layers. Transparencyis dependent on several factors: a highly ordered cellular arrangement;fiber size, shape, and uniformity; molecular structure; and regularityof fiber packing (Potts 1986/Ex. 1-174). Interference with lens metabolism,with transport across cell boundaries, or with the integrity of the lenscapsule itself can cause a loss of lens transparency and lead to decreasedvisual acuity (Potts 1986/Ex. 1-174). All such changes in lens transparencyare referred to as cataracts.<T3>Retinal effects. </T3>The retina is a compact neural structure thatis responsible for converting the ocular light image to neural impulses.Because the retina is an internal structure, it is not generally affectedby exposure to dust, splashes of liquids, or vapors. However, exposureto certain internally absorbed substances, such as methyl alcohol, maycause changes or lesions in the retina, including retinal edema or hemorrhage.Exposure to a few of these substances can cause acute narrowing of theretinal arteries themselves, which can lead, in turn, to damage of theoptic nerve and loss of vision.<T3>Effects on ganglion cell layer and optic nerve. </T3>Below the retinalsurface layer lies the ganglion cell layer, which is composed of the cellbodies of neurons that extend to the midbrain via the optic nerve. Ganglioncells may be damaged directly when the chemical acts on the cell bodiesthemselves or secondarily when the toxin destroys the optic nerve. Dependingon the severity of the exposure, loss of visual acuity or vision may ensue.Dose-Response Relationships and Ocular EffectsFor most of the chemicals on this list, limits have been established onthe basis of health surveys and case reports of occupationally exposedpopulations. These studies indicate that exposures to concentrations ofthese substances at levels above the NOE level cause damage or pain tothe eyes of exposed workers. In some cases only limited human data areavailable, and evidence from animal studies or knowledge of a chemical'sstructural analogy to another chemical known to have ocular effects providesthe basis for the exposure limit. Animal models are generally good predictorsof ocular effects in humans because the eyes of rodents, especially thoseof guinea pigs and rabbits, closely resemble human eyes. Thus, animal studiesof the effects of exposure on the eye can be relied on to predict accuratelyhow the chemicals that produce these effects in animals will behave inworkers exposed in industrial situations. For the five chemicals in thisgroup, the available toxicologic data, the record evidence, and OSHA'sfinal determinations as to their limits are described below.<ITAG tagnum="71">N-ETHYLMORPHOLINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 100-74-3; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>13</T2>NO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1172</ITAG>OSHA's former 8-hour TWA PEL for N-ethylmorpholine was 20 ppm, with a skinnotation. The proposed permissible exposure limit was 5 ppm as an 8-hourTWA, also with a skin notation, and the final rule establishes this limitand retains the skin notation, which is consistent with the limits of theACGIH. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) agrees with the selection of this limit.N-Ethylmorpholine is a colorless, flammable liquid with an ammonia-likeodor; this substance is a severe eye irritant.Prolonged exposure to fairly low concentrations of this substance causescorneal edema, blue-gray vision, and colored haloes. Typically, visionbecomes misty and haloes appear a few hours after workers have been exposedto the vapors for a period of hours. Distortion of vision can occur evenat levels considerably lower than those that cause irritation (Mastromatteo1965/Ex. 1-146).Reversible corneal edema has been observed in workers exposed to 40 ppmor more of N-ethylmorpholine for several hours (Dernehl 1966a/Ex. 1-62).Workers routinely exposed to 3- to 4-ppm concentrations but never to concentrationsabove 11 ppm complained of haloes and foggy vision as well as drowsiness(ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 263). The irritant effects of N-ethylmorpholinewere also seen in a controlled-exposure experiment on volunteer subjects.Ten subjects exposed for 2.5 minutes to a concentration of 100 ppm experiencedirritation of the eyes, nose, and throat; those exposed for 2.5 minutesto 50 ppm experienced slight irritation; and no irritation was reportedafter exposure for 2.5 minutes to 25 ppm (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 263).N-ethylmorpholine is also readily absorbed through the skin (Smyth, Carpenter,Weil, and Pozzani 1954/Ex. 1-440).OSHA's former 20-ppm PEL for N-ethylmorpholine did not protect exposedworkers against the occurrence of corneal edema. Because corneal edemais painless as it is developing and symptoms have a delayed onset, workersare especially likely not to be aware of the danger of exposure. This isparticularly hazardous because the effects on visual function of repeatedlyexposing the eyes to substances that cause corneal edema are not known.The Agency received no comments on the health effects or revised exposurelimits for N-ethylmorpholine, with the exception of NIOSH's submission.OSHA concludes that reducing the PEL to 5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA (and retainingthe skin notation) is necessary to protect occupationally exposed workersfrom ethylmorpholine's injurious ocular effects. The new, lower PEL willreduce the significant risk of material health impairment, which is manifestedas corneal edema, visual distortion, and impaired vision, that is associatedwith exposure to this substance at concentrations above the revised PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">HYDROGEN SULFIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7783-06-4; Chemical Formula: H<T2>2</T2>S</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1209</ITAG>OSHA's former limits for hydrogen sulfide were a 20-ppm STEL (10-minutemaximum duration) and a 50-ppm ceiling limit. The proposed and final rulefor this substance are 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 15 ppm as a STEL. Theselimits are consistent with those of the ACGIH. NIOSH has a REL for hydrogensulfide of 10 ppm as a 10-minute ceiling. Hydrogen sulfide is a colorless,flammable gas with the odor of rotten eggs. It is widely used as an agriculturaldisinfectant, chemical intermediate, analytical reagent, and in the manufactureof heavy water in the utilities sector. However, occupational exposureto hydrogen sulfide occurs most frequently when it is encountered in naturaloil or gas deposits or as a by-product in chemical reactions.The 1986 ACGIH <T3>Documentation </T3>(Ex. 1-3, p. 318) cites several reports (Brieger1964; Kranenburg and Kessener 1935; Masure 1950; Elkins 1950a/Ex. 1-953)of the occurrence of adverse ocular effects, including conjunctivitis,associated with exposure to 20 ppm or less of hydrogen sulfide. A studyby Poda and Aiken (1966/Ex. 1-115) reports that the adoption of a voluntarylimit of 10 ppm in two heavy-water plants eliminated exposure problems.An early study by Flury and Zernik (1931f, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 318) reports that the conjunctivitis caused by exposure to 10 to 15ppm of hydrogen sulfide for six hours endured for several days; however,OSHA is unaware of cases in which this substance caused irreversible eyedamage. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)relied essentially on the studies discussed above (Poda and Aiken 1966/Ex.1-115; Flury and Zernik 1931f, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 318)when recommending its limit for hydrogen sulfide of 10 ppm for 10 minutes;NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N7) continues to recommend this ceiling for hydrogensulfide (this issue is discussed further below).OSHA received several comments related to the health effects and proposedlimits for hydrogen sulfide (Exs. 3-1163, 3-216, 8-37, 8-47, 129; Tr. XI,pp. 114, 225). The Atlantic Electric Company (Ex. 3-1163) pointed out anerror in the proposal, which listed the short-term exposure limit for hydrogensulfide as 5 ppm rather than 15 ppm. The Edison Electric Institute (EEI)(Tr. XI, p. 225) explained that utility workers are exposed to hydrogensulfide when they enter utility manholes and vaults that are located nearcoastal areas, where this gas seeps into underground spaces. The EEI reportsthat utility workers use respirators and ventilate these spaces beforeentering. The Montana Sulphur and Chemical Corporation (Ex. 3-216), a small-businessmanufacturer, handler, and shipper of hydrogen sulfide, commented that,in its opinion, ``the evidence presented for significantly tightening theexisting standards is not at all compelling.'' According to Montana Sulphur,the studies cited by OSHA in the proposal to support the revised limitsof 10 ppm (TWA) and 15 ppm (STEL) for hydrogen sulfide involved concurrentexposures ``to other pollutants or stressors peculiar to the incident involved''(Ex. 3-216, p. 2). In addition, Montana Sulphur objects to OSHA's relianceon a study by Poda and Aiken (1966/Ex. 1-115) showing that voluntary compliancewith an internal standard of 10 ppm at a facility in the heavy-water industryeliminated complaints of eye irritation among hydrogen-sulfide-exposedworkers at this facility (Ex. 3-216). Montana Sulphur and Chemical reportsthat, in its long experience of manufacturing and handling this ``notoriouslytoxic'' substance, it has never had a case of eye irritation that requiredmedical treatment; it urges OSHA to promulgate a STEL for hydrogen sulfidein the range of 25 to 30 ppm rather than the proposed 15 ppm (Ex. 3-216).OSHA appreciates this commenter's thoughtful and thorough discussion ofhis company's experience in dealing with hydrogen sulfide in the workplace.However, OSHA's revised 8-hour TWA for this substance is based on the bestavailable evidence (i.e., data on a level of occupational exposure thathas been shown not to produce the health effect of concern). The eye irritationprotential of hydrogen sulfide at levels below 20 ppm is widely recognized;the comment from Montana Sulphur (Ex. 3-216) acknowledges that reductionof the 8-hour TWA to 10 to 12 ppm is warranted. OSHA finds that a STELof 15 ppm is justified by reports of eye irritation caused by short-termexposures to levels below 15 ppm (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 318). OSHA isalso aware that conditions in industry often involve simultaneous exposuresto more than one hazardous substance and that such mixed exposures mayincrease the severity of the effects experienced by workers. However, theAgency must establish exposure limits based on the best available evidencefor each individual substance to be regulated; it cannot attempt to setdifferent limits for substances on the basis of the enormous number ofother substances with which they could potentially be associated in actualuse.OSHA also received a comment on hydrogen sulfide from NIOSH (Ex. 8-47,Table N7). NIOSH recommends a single 10-ppm 10-minute ceiling for thissubstance. The United Paperworkers International Union (Ex. 8-37) alsorecommends adoption of the NIOSH 10-minute ceiling of 10 ppm. The Agencybelieves that the protection provided by NIOSH's 10-ppm short-term limitis essentially equivalent to that provided by OSHA's combined TWA-STELlimits, and that the combination of a 10-ppm 8-hour TWA and a 15-ppm STELestablished in the final rule will provide broader protection in workplacescharacterized either by short-term or by steady-state exposures.The New Jersey Department of Health (Ex. 144) urged OSHA to base its limitsfor hydrogen sulfide on EPA's IRIS data. OSHA discusses this approach andNew Jersey's comment in Section VI.A of this preamble.OSHA concludes that the former 20-ppm (10-minute) short-term limit and50-ppm ceiling limit did not adequately protect workers against the adverseocular effects associated with exposure to concentrations of hydrogen sulfidebelow 20 ppm, as reported in several studies. OSHA finds that the eye irritationand conjunctivitis associated with such exposures represent a significantrisk of material health impairment to workers, who may be forced to seekmedical treatment after such exposure and who may also be unable to workduring the period of recovery. OSHA has accordingly established an 8-hourTWA limit for hydrogen sulfide of 10 ppm and a short-term limit of 15 ppm.These levels have been demonstrated to be effective in preventing irritationand conjunctivitis in the workplace (Poda and Aiken 1966/Ex. 1-115). TheAgency finds that this dual limit will provide protection both in continuoussteady-state exposure situations and in those characterized by sharp peaksand will do so more effectively than a single, short-term limit such asthat recommended by NIOSH.<ITAG tagnum="71">METHYL ALCOHOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 67-56-1; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>OH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1252</ITAG>OSHA's former 8-hour TWA limit for methyl alcohol was 200 ppm. The proposedlimits were an 8-hour TWA of 200 ppm, a STEL of 250 ppm, and a skin notation.The final rule establishes these limits, which are consistent with thoseof the ACGIH. NIOSH previously recommended exposure limits for this substanceof 200 ppm as a TWA and 800 ppm as a STEL; however, after reviewing thehealth evidence for methyl alcohol, NIOSH concurs with OSHA's final rulePELs for this substance (Ex. 8-47, Table N1). Methyl alcohol is a mobile,highly polar, flammable liquid that is widely used as an industrial solvent.As stated in the proposal (53 <T3>FR </T3>21061), workers exposed to concentrations of methyl alcoholbetween 200 and 375 ppm experience severe recurrent headaches, and at levelsbetween 1200 and 8300 ppm, studies by Kingsley and Hirsch (1954/Ex. 1-212)report that the visual capacities of exposed individuals are diminished.OSHA finds that a 250-ppm STEL is necessary because an 8-hour PEL of 200ppm alone does not protect workers from exposure to short-term peaks atlevels that cause eye irritation and severe, recurrent headaches in exposedworkers. Although the skin LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 20 g/kg, OSHA is adding a skin notation for methylalcohol in the final rule (see Section VI.C.18 for a discussion of theAgency's policy on skin notations). The Agency's reason for establishinga skin notation for methyl alcohol despite this high dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is that a dermal LD<T2>Lo</T2> of 500 mg/kg has been reported for this substance in monkeys(<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>7th ed., Sax andLewis 1989, p. 1377).Several commenters submitted information to the record on methyl alcohol(Exs. 150 (Comments on Methyl Alcohol), 194, 3-661, 3-902, and 3-896).The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA) (Ex. 3-902) presentedno substantive comment with regard to methyl alcohol; instead, the MVMAlisted 41 chemicals, including methyl alcohol, that, in the opinion ofthe MVMA, require ``more review * * * to allow OSHA and industry additionaltime to properly assess * * * [the technological and economic] consequences''of revising the limit. Both the Eastman Kodak Company (Ex. 3-661) and theChevron Corporation (Ex. 3-896) submitted specific comments on OSHA's proposalto add a STEL of 250 ppm to the existing 8-hour TWA of 200 ppm. RepresentingChevron, Stanley Dryden stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">We do not believe that the proposed 250-ppm STEL is justified by thediscussion in [OSHA's] preamble (Ex. 3-896, p. 10).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">According to Kodak, the study by Kingsley and Hirsch (1954/Ex. 1-212)that was cited by OSHA in support of the STEL involved exposures to a duplicatingmachine fluid that contained between 5 and 98 percent methyl alcohol and2 to 9 percent of an unidentified fluid(s). Kodak is of the opinion thatthe severe headaches experienced by exposed employees may have been relatedto the unidentified components of the fluid rather than to methyl alcohol,and further that these exposures may not have been the result of short-termexposures (Ex. 3-661).OSHA finds Chevron's and Eastman Kodak's comments unpersuasive, for severalreasons. First, the measured airborne levels of methyl alcohol reportedin the Kingsley and Hirsch study (1954/Ex. 1-212) ranged from 200 to 375ppm when employees were using direct process duplicating fluids; otherstudies also report that exposure to methyl alcohol at these levels causesheadaches (Henson 1960, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 372). Thus,the effects cited in the Kingsley and Hirsch study (1954/Ex. 1-212) arebiologically plausible and consistent with those reported in other studiesof the effects of this substance. Second, OSHA believes that a 250-ppmSTEL is needed to ensure that workers are not exposed, even for short periods,to the elevated levels that have been shown to cause these effects. NIOSHhas reevaluated the toxicological evidence for a STEL for methyl alcoholand concurs with the 250-ppm limit OSHA is establishing in the final rule.According to NIOSH (Ex. 150, Comments on Methyl Alcohol):<ITAG tagnum="21">[T]here appears to be no justification for a ceiling of 800 ppm [theceiling level formerly recommended by NIOSH]. It appears that data aremore supportive of the OSHA and ACGIH STEL of 250 ppm * * * it seems reasonableto update the NIOSH recommended ceiling (Ex. 150).</ITAG>Thus, OSHA has determined that the addition of a STEL is necessary to reducethe significant risk of disturbed vision and headaches to which workerscould be and have been exposed in the absence of a limit on short-termexposures. As discussed above, NIOSH concurs with OSHA that a short-termlimit of 250 ppm is appropriate for methyl alcohol; NIOSH described a recentstudy (Frederic et al. 1984, as cited in Ex. 150, Comments on Methyl Alcohol)that found that teachers' aides exposed to 80 to 3080 ppm of methyl alcoholwhile using duplicating machines experienced blurred vision, headaches,dizziness, and skin problems. The AFL-CIO (Ex. 194, p. A-12) supports theaddition of a STEL and a skin notation for methyl alcohol.The final rule promulgates an 8-hour TWA of 200 ppm, a STEL of 250 ppm,and a skin notation for methyl alcohol. OSHA concludes that the 8-hourTWA and 15-minute STEL will work together to reduce substantially the significantrisk of headaches and blurred vision presented by short-term occupationalexposures to methyl alcohol at concentrations above 250 ppm. The Agencyfinds that the headache, blurred vision, and other ocular effects associatedwith exposure to methyl alcohol constitute material impairments of health.<ITAG tagnum="71">METHYL SILICATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 681-84-5; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>O)<T2>4</T2>Si</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1266</ITAG>OSHA did not formerly have a limit for methyl silicate; the Agency proposedthe adoption of a 1-ppm 8-hour TWA for this substance, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47,Table N1) concurred with this selection. The final rule establishes thislimit, which is consistent with that of the ACGIH. Methyl silicate existsin the form of colorless needles. Methyl silicate damages the cornea and is associated with a delayed onsetof symptoms. In many cases of methyl silicate exposure, the eyes recovercompletely, but there are reports of damage to the deep layers of the corneathat caused permanent opacification and, in one worker, loss of visionin one eye (Grant 1986/Ex. 1-975). It is estimated that exposing humansto methyl silicate at concentrations of 200 to 300 ppm for 15 minutes willproduce lesions, and that exposure to 1000 ppm for this period will produceinjury requiring hospitalization (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 409). Rabbits exposed to 1000 ppm of methyl silicate in dry air experienced delayedeye burns (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 409). Exposure of these animals to approximately15,000 ppm for five minutes caused eye burns, but exposure to this levelfor four minutes caused no appreciable effect. Guinea pigs showed maximumno-effect levels of 135 ppm for 15 minutes, 90 ppm for one hour, and 20ppm for 8 one-hour periods. The latency period for ocular changes was 16hours for serious effects and up to three days for mild involvement (ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 409). Only NIOSH commented on this substance. Because the onset of response to this toxin is delayed, because exposurein the workplace could have a duration substantially greater than thatin the animal bioassasys, and because of interspecies variability, it isnecessary to establish a PEL considerably below the NOE level in animalsto reduce the significant risk of ocular damge to employees. The Agencyis therefore establishing a 1-ppm 8-hour TWA limit for methyl siliciteto reduce the significant risk of severe ocular effects associated withthe uncontrolled exposures formerly possible in the absence of a PEL. TheAgency concludes that this limit will substantially reduce this significantrisk by protecting workers from the ocular effects of methyl silicate exposure,which constitute material impairments of health.<ITAG tagnum="71">NAPHTHALENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 91-20-3; Chemical Formula: C<T2>10</T2>H<T2>8</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1282</ITAG>OSHA's former exposure limit for naphthalene was 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.The final rule retains this TWA and adds a short-term limit of 15 ppm forthis substance, which occurs as a colorless to brown solid and has theodor of mothballs. The ACGIH also has a 10-ppm 8-hour TWA and a 15-ppmSTEL for naphthalene. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs with the PELsselected for this substance. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> for naphthalene in rats is 1760 mg/kg (Flury and Zernik 1931g/Ex.1-995). In humans, the inhalation of naphthalene vapor causes headache,loss of appetite, and nausea (Flury and Zernik 1931g/Ex. 1-995; Patty 1949b,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 420). These authors also report thatexposure causes optical neuritis, corneal damage, and kidney injury. Eightof 21 workers exposed for five years to unspecified levels of naphthalenedeveloped opacities of the lens of the eye (Ghetti and Mariani 1956/Ex.1-739). Ingestion of large amounts of naphthalene causes severe hemolyticanemia and hemoglobinuria (Stokinger and Mountain 1963/Ex. 1-765). Thelethal dose in humans has been reported as 50 mg/kg (NIOSH 1977i/Ex. 1-1182).Concentrations somewhat above 15 ppm are reported to cause marked eye irritation(Robbins 1951/Ex. 1-799). Only the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) and NIOSH commented onnaphthalene. The AISI (Exs. 129 and 188) believes that a STEL for naphthaleneis not warranted by the evidence. However, the Robbins (1951/Ex. 1-799)study discussed above clearly shows that excursions to 15 ppm cause severeeye irritation, and OSHA thus finds the STEL both necessary and appropriate. In the final rule, the Agency is retaining the 8-hour TWA of 10 ppm andadding a 15-minute STEL of 15 ppm for naphthalene. This STEL is designedto protect against the eye irritation observed in workers at elevated levels(Robbins 1951/Ex. 1-799). The Agency concludes that these limits will protectworkers from the significant risks of eye irritation and serious oculareffects, which constitute material health impairments that are potentiallyassociated with exposure to levels above the 8-hour limit.Conclusions for This Group of Ocular Toxins OSHA finds that promulgation of the final rule's limits for this groupof chemicals, which have the potential to cause adverse ocular effectsranging from transient discomfort to permanent blindness, will substantiallyreduce the significant risk of visual impairment associated with occupationalexposure to these substances. The toxicological basis for the final rule'slimits include evidence derived from occupationally exposed workers andresults obtained in animals that have been shown to be excellent predictorsof human responses. The risks being protected against have serious consequences,both in terms of material impairment of health and interference with thefunctional capacity of those workers who are themselves exposed and thesafety and well-being of these workers and their co-workers. Thus, OSHAfinds that the limits established by the final rule are necessary to reducethese significant occupational risks, which constitute material healthimpairments of health within the meaning of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of RespiratoryEffects Introduction </ITAG>Limits are being established for a total of 35 substances or materialsfor which exposure has been shown to cause adverse respiratory effects.The chemicals in this group cause acute pulmonary edema, alveolar damage,or chronic respiratory damage through the general mechanisms of cellulardamage or fibrosis. At sufficient doses, these effects can be permanent,disabling, and life-threatening.Some of the materials in this group are composites of naturally occurringminerals, and, for these, the Agency is establishing limits based on themost hazardous component. For several materials (coal dust, crystallinetripoli, silica, and graphite), OSHA is requiring the TWA to be measuredas the respirable quartz fraction of the dust, because it is exposure tothis fraction that presents the greatest risk to exposed workers.Table C6-1 lists the 35 substances in this group, along with the former,proposed, and final rule PELs, and CAS and HS Numbers. There was no formerOSHA PEL for 12 of these substances. For one substance, OSHA is establishinga ceiling limit to replace an existing 8-hour TWA, and for ten substances,a lower TWA and/or STEL are being established. In three instances, OSHAis establishing a STEL to augment its former TWA-PELs. For nine substances,OSHA is changing only the form in which the limit is being expressed.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M005</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 0 649-653</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Description of the Health EffectsThe respiratory system is a major route of occupational exposure for toxicsubstances. Because of the vital nature of pulmonary function, respiratorytoxicants present a serious health hazard both from acute and chronic exposures.Acute respiratory disease can be life threatening.Chronic pulmonary disease can result from long-term exposure to respiratorytoxicants and is potentially crippling because it greatly reduces the qualityof life and the productivity of its victims. In addition, the onset ofrespiratory disease can be insidious, because it may be indicated onlyby the gradual development of a few nonspecific signs (Petersdorf et al.,<T3>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine,</T3> 10th ed., 1983).The difficulties of detecting irreversible respiratory effects complicatethe prevention of pulmonary disease. Pulmonary function can be evaluatedwith a variety of tests, including measurements of the vital capacity andof the resting and forced expiratory volumes. However, certain conditions,including emphysema and fibrosis, are difficult to diagnose even with suchtests. In addition, these same diseases often continue to progress evenafter the affected individual has recognized the problem and obtained medicalassistance. Furthermore, these diseases may continue to progress even afterexposure has ceased, which makes prevention even more vital.In addition to the threat posed to the general occupational populationby respiratory toxins, certain subpopulations, such as persons with impairedlung function caused by asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and pulmonary fibrosis,are at special risk from the adverse effects of respiratory toxins. Tobaccosmoking can cause or aggravate all of the respiratory conditions discussedabove and can interact additively or synergistically with respiratory toxinsto increase their adverse effects on the pulmonary system. For example,tobacco smoking acts additively with coal dust to diminish pulmonary function.Because tobacco smoke contains nitrogen oxides, cadmium, and ammonia, occupationallyexposed workers who smoke have an additional source of exposure to theserespiratory toxins.Two general categories of lung injuries are relevant to the group of substancesunder consideration:andbullet; Damage to cells lining the airways, which results in necrosis(localized areas of dead cells), increased permeability, and edema.andbullet; Production of fibrosis, which may become massive and greatly reducelung capacity.<T3>Cellular damage resulting in edema and emphysema.</T3> A number ofsubstances cause damage to cells lining the airways. This can result inincreased permeability of cell membranes and subsequent edema, hemorrhage,and localized necrosis (areas of dead cells). Chronic inhalation of certainchemicals causes destruction of the alveolar septa and results in emphysema.Cellular damage may be either localized or diffuse, depending on the distributionof the toxicant in the lung.Edema is the release of fluid into the lumen (open spaces of the airways)or alveoli. Serious edema can take several hours to develop so that, insome cases, life-threatening or even fatal exposures can take place withoutthe individual's being aware at the time of exposure of the extent of thedamage. Ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and paraquat all cause localized cellulardamage leading to edema (Klaassen, Amdur, Doull et al. 1986/Ex. 1-99).Fatalities from pulmonary edema have resulted from exposures to concentrationsof nitrogen dioxide of about 200 ppm (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials,</T3> 6th ed., Sax 1984).Paraquat is unusual in that it can cause delayed pulmonary damage followingexposure, even when exposure occurs via routes other than inhalation (Klaassen,Amdur, Doull et al. 1986/Ex. 1-99).Necrotic changes can reduce the functional surface area of the lung. Onetype of lesion often noted in persons exposed to respiratory toxins isbenign granulomas, which are localized masses formed when the immune systemattempts to sequester a foreign object. Depending on the extent of thedamage, these masses may reduce the functional capacity of the lung. Exposureto selenium-doped bismuth telluride has been associated with the productionof benign granulomas without fibrosis (Wagner, Madden, Zimber, and Stokinger1974, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 59).Emphysema is caused by a gradual destruction of the cells of the alveolarsepta, which causes a loss of elasticity in the lung. A slight degree ofemphysema is present in much of the adult population and does not causeany functional impairment. As the disease progresses, however, seriousand life-threatening reductions in functional capacity can occur. Oncethe disease has advanced to the point of serious functional impairment,it is, for the most part, irreversible (Petersdorf et al. 1983). Thereis evidence that a number of the substances in this group cause emphysema,including sulfur tetrafluoride (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3), ozone, and nitrogendioxide (Klaassen, Amdur, Doull et al. 1986/Ex. 1-99).<T3>Fibrotic changes.</T3> Pulmonary fibrosis was one of the earliest recognizedforms of occupational disease. Fibrosis should be distinguished from pneumoconiosis,although these terms are often used interchangeably. Pneumoconiosis isa more general term indicating the presence of a foreign substance in thelungs, as determined by radiographic (X-ray) analysis. This definitionencompasses a variety of conditions and does not by itself necessarilyindicate functional damage (Petersdorf et al. 1983). In contrast, fibrosisis a seriously debilitating disease. One type of fibrosis is interstitialfibrosis, which is a kind of pneumoconiosis characterized by depositionof fibrous tissue in the interstitial spaces between the alveolar membraneand the pulmonary capillary membrane. Interstitial fibrosis greatly reducesthe diffusing capacity of the lung and thus causes oxygen deprivation inthe body (Guyton 1981/Ex. 1-1002). Like emphysema, fibrosis is largelyirreversible; it sometimes progresses even in the absence of further exposure(Petersdorf et al. 1983).Silicosis is a form of interstitial fibrosis that is caused by exposureto respirable silica particles (Klaassen, Amdur, Doull et al. 1986/Ex.1-99). Exposure to coal dust causes a pneumoconiosis with fibrosis thatcan be severely debilitating (Petersdorf et al. 1983). In addition, exposureto graphite, mica, and grain dust have all been associated with fibrosisin workers (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3).Dose-Response Relationships and Respiratory EffectsFor most of the substances in this group, permissible exposure limits havebeen based on health surveys and case reports of occupationally exposedpopulations. In some cases, animal studies provide the evidence of a substance'stoxicity. As is the case for most of the substances for which OSHA is establishingnew, reduced, or revised limits, the dose-response curve for respiratoryirritants tends to be S-shaped.Table C6-2 presents dose-response data on the adverse pulmonary effectsof representative chemicals in this group, the populations exposed, andthe endpoints observed. The following discussions describe the record evidence,present OSHA's findings for all the substances on Table C6-1, and describethe nature of the risks faced by workers exposed to them.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M004</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 0 659-662</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">ALUMINUM (PYRO POWDERS)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7429-90-5; Chemical Formula: Al</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed and final ruleshave a PEL of 5 mg/m\3\ for the aluminum pyro powders; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47,Table N1) concurs with this limit. Powders and flake aluminum are flammableand can form explosive mixtures in air. Aluminum pyro powders have a higher reported toxicity than aluminum metaldusts (Stokinger 1981a/Ex. 1-1133). Several British studies have examinedthe effects of exposure to this finely flaked aluminum on workers in paintsand pyrotechnics plants. Their findings revealed that pulmonary fibrosismay result from exposure to pyro powders, although epidemiologic evidenceindicates that additives used to prevent oxidation and agglomeration mayhave contributed to the incidence and nature of the disease (Edling 1961/Ex.1-733; Jordan 1961/Ex. 1-559; Mitchell, Manning, Molyneux, and Lane 1961/Ex.1-564). Exposures that have previously caused lung changes in workers arepresumed to have been extremely high (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 22). No comments,other than NIOSH's, were received on these powders. OSHA concludes that the permissible exposure limit of 5 mg/m\3\ TWA foraluminum pyro powders will prevent the significant risk of lung changesin workers exposed at the concentrations formerly permitted by the absenceof an OSHA limit. The Agency has determined that these lung changes constitutematerial impairment of health. <ITAG tagnum="71">BISMUTH TELLURIDE (DOPED)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1304-82-1; Chemical Formula: Bi<T2>2</T2> Te<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1034</ITAG>OSHA had no former limit for doped bismuth telluride (Bi<T2>2</T2> Te<T2>3</T2>). The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 5 mg/m\3\ for Bi<T2>2</T2> Te<T2>3</T2> that has been doped with selenium sulfide. The proposed PELwas 5 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs withthis limit, and the final rule establishes it. Bismuth telluride appearsas gray, hexagonal platelets; it is also available as ingots or singlecrystals. Wagner, Madden, Zimber, and Stokinger (1974, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 59) conducted a one-year study in which rabbits, dogs, and ratswere exposed for six hours/day, five days/week to doped bismuth telluridedust (containing 80.04 mol % Bi<T2>2</T2> Te<T2>3</T2> and 0.20 mol % SnTe, plus a small stoichiometric excess of Te)of 1.04 um particle diameter at a mean concentration of 15 mg/m\3\. Small,granulomatous lesions without fibrosis appeared in the lungs of dogs atsix months. In dogs that were sacrificed four months after an eight-monthexposure, the lesions had regressed, and the affected lymph nodes werewithout cellular reaction. Rabbits exhibited similar histologic effects,but with decreased numbers of pulmonary macrophages, no fibrous tissueproliferation, and no cellular or fibrous tissue reaction around the dustdeposits in the lymph nodes. The rats showed fewer granulomas but someareas of epithelialization of the alveolar walls. As was true for the otherspecies, the rats showed neither fibrosis nor cellular reaction in thelymph nodes, despite accumulation of the intermetallic dust (Wagner, Madden,Zimber, and Stokinger 1974, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 59). OnlyNIOSH commented on this substance. In the final rule, an 8-hour PEL of 5 mg/m\3\ TWA is established for Se-dopedbismuth telluride to prevent the occurrence of the pulmonary lesions seenin experimental animals. OSHA concludes that this limit will substantiallyreduce the significant risk of these pulmonary effects. <ITAG tagnum="71">CHLORINE DIOXIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 10049-04-4; Chemical Formula: CIO<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1080</ITAG>Previously, OSHA had an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.1 ppm for chlorine dioxide.The ACGIH recommends the same time-weighted average and a 15-minute STELof 0.3 ppm. The proposal retained the same TWA and added a 15-minute STELof 0.3 ppm, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1 concurred with these limits,which are established in the final rule. Chlorine dioxide is a red-yellowgas at ordinary temperatures. Rats exposed to 0.1-ppm concentrations of chlorine dioxide for 10 weeksat five hours daily showed no adverse effects from exposures. Other datain animals are not available (Dalhamn 1957/Ex. 1-307). Data on human exposures indicate that marked irritation occurs on inhalationof 5 ppm (no time specified), and that one death occurred at 19 ppm (Elkins1959b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 118). Repeated exposures in humanshave been linked to bronchitis and and pronounced emphysema (Petry 1954/Ex.1-1163). Clinical studies conducted by Gloemme and Lundgren (1975/Ex. 1-323)revealed that the majority of workers who had been exposed for five yearsto average concentrations of chlorine dioxide below 0.1 ppm, in combinationwith about 1.0 ppm chlorine, experienced eye and respiratory irritationand slight bronchitis. Some gastrointestinal irritation was also observedin these workers. Gloemme and Lundgren (1957/Ex. 1-323 attributed all ofthese effects to elavated short-term exposures involving excursions abovethe 0.1 ppm level. Ferris, Burgess, and Worcester (1967/Ex. 1-316) haveshown that concentrations occasionally ranging as high as 0.25 ppm wereassociated with respiratory effects in workers concomitantly exposed tochlorine. The United Paperworkers International Union (UPIU) supportedthe development of comprehensive standards for irritant gases such as chloridedioxide. In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 0.1-ppm 8-hour TWA and addinga 15-minute STEL of 0.3 ppm for chlorine dioxide. The Agency concludesthat both of these limits are necessary to protect workers against thesignificant risk of respiratory, skin, and eye irritation known to occuras a result of short-term exposures above the TWA of 0.1 ppm. OSHA hasdetermined that these adverse effects constitute material impairment ofhealth.<ITAG tagnum="71">CHROMIUM, METAL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-47-3; Chemical Formula: Cr</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1093</ITAG>OSHA formerly had an 8-hour TWA of 1 mg/m3 for chromium metal. The proposedPEL was 0.5 mg/m3 NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with the proposedlimit. The ACGIH has established an 8-hour TWA of 0.5 mg/m3 for chromium,which is a steel-grey metal. In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the former8-hour TWA PEL of 1 mg/m3 for chromium metal.According to the ACGIH, a 0.5-mg/m3 TLV-TWA for chromium ``should be adequateto prevent pulmonary disease or other toxic effects'' (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 139). Many commenters objected to the proposed 0.5-mg/m3 PEL for chromiummetal (Exs. 3-236, 3-829, 3-902, 3-1095, 3-1123, 129, 145, and 188; Tr.pp. 11-136 to 11-137). These commenters argued that there was no healthbasis for lowering the PEL for chromium metal and questioned the studiesdescribed in the health effects discussion for this substance. For example,Peter Hernandez, Vice President for Employee Relations at the AmericanIron and Steel Institute (AISI), commented in several submissions thatone of the studies (Mancuso and Hueper (1951/Ex. 1-215) relied on by OSHA,which was performed for the Indian government in 1951, found ``exaggeratedpulmonary markings'' on the X-rays of exposed workers but failed to demonstratethat these markings constituted a health risk to these workers (Ex. 188,p. 18). The AISI also criticized the results of another study relied onby OSHA, the work of Princi et al. (1962, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 139), which detected pulmonary disease in workers exposed to chromiumat levels of 0.27 mg/m3 (Princi, Miller, Davis, and Cholak 1962, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 139). According to the AISI, ``the results ofthis study are highly questionable * * * because other dust and fumes besideschromium were present, including 36.7 percent silica'' (Ex. 188, p. 19).In response to these comments, OSHA has further reviewed the toxicologicalliterature on chromium metal. The Agency finds that the metallic form ofchromium, in its pure state, does not present a significant risk to exposedworkers at levels below 1 mg/m3, OSHA's former 8-hour TWA PEL for thissubstance. This view of chromium metal's toxicity is shared by severaltoxicologists. For example, Proctor, Hughes, and Fischman (<T3>Chemical Hazards of the Workplace</T3>, 2nd ed., 1988, p. 155) state,``Chromium metal is relatively nontoxic * * * OSHA finds that the markingsassociated with exposure to chromium metal (which were not suggestive ofalteration of the architecture of the lung) and reported in the Mancusoand Hueper (1951/Ex. 1-215) study do not present a risk of material impairmentof health because they do not presage any decrement in pulmonary functionor interfere with the functional capacity of exposed workers.<ITAG tagnum="21">OSHA also agrees with the AISI that</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">[A] major problem [in] defining the health effects which may be associatedwith exposure to metallic chromium is the frequent co-existence of themetallic form with both trivalent and hexavalent salts (Tr. p. 11-136).</ITAG>The Princi et al. study (1962, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 139)reflects the problem of confounding exposures to which the AISI alludes.In this study, ferrochrome alloy workers were exposed to several toxiccontaminants simultaneously, including chromium, salts, silica, iron oxide,and chromium metal. OSHA believes it likely that exposure to the othercontaminants present, which included a high percentage of silica, accountsfor the development of pulmonary disease in these workers. The ACGIH (1986/Ex.1-3, p. 139) stated, after reviewing the Mancuso and Hueper (1951/Ex. 1-215)and the Princi et al. (1962, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 139) studies,that ``[e]xposure to chromium metal does not give rise to pulmonary fibrosisor pneumoconiosis.''Thus, after a reanalysis of the toxicological data and the record evidence,OSHA concludes that there is no health basis for reducing the Agency'sformer limit of 1 mg/m3 for chromium metal. OSHA finds that the 1-mg/m3PEL provides appropriate worker protection from the toxic effects of exposureto chromium metal.Accordingly, in the final rule, OSHA is retaining the former 8-hour TWAlimit of 1.0 mg/m3 for chromium metal. The Agency concludes that this limitprotects workers against the significant risk of pulmonary effects potentiallyassociated with exposure to the metallic form of chromium.<ITAG tagnum="71">COAL DUST, andless; 5% QUARTZ</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">COAL DUST, andgreater; 5% QUARTZ</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: None; Chemical Formula: None</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. Nos. 1096 and 1097</ITAG>OSHA's former limits for coal dust included a formula limit of 10 mg/m3/%SiO<T2>2</T2>+2 for coal dust containing a respirable quartz fraction greaterthan 5 percent and a 2.4-mg/m3 limit for coal dust containing a respirablequartz fraction of less than 5 percent. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 0.1mg/m3 for the respirable quartz fraction of coal dust containing more than5 percent quartz, and 2 mg/m3 for the respirable dust fraction of coaldust containing less than 5 percent quartz. OSHA proposed 8-hour TWA limitsof 0.1 mg/m3 for the respirable quartz fraction of coal dust containingmore than 5 percent quartz and 2 mg/m3 for the respirable dust fractioncontaining less than 5 percent quartz; the final rule establishes theselimits. OSHA's proposed and final rule limits do not represent an actualchange in the value of the limits for coal dust containing more than 5percent respirable quartz; instead, they do away with the Agency's previousand cumbersome formula limit. Coal is a dark brown to black solid formedfrom fossilized plants.Because OSHA is not lowering the limits for coal dust or considering thehealth effects evidence for these limits but is merely changing the formin which the limits are expressed, no discussion of the health evidenceis included in the final rule. The Gulf Power Company (Exs. 3-938 and 3-1144)believed that OSHA was proposing to change the value of the coal dust limitsrather than the form in which those limits were being expressed. In thefinal rule, OSHA has clarified this fact by emphasizing it in the beginningand end of this discussion. Lawrence Hecker, Corporate Director of IndustrialHygiene and Toxicology for Abbott Laboratories, requested that both Z-tableentries for coal dust in the final rule specifically indicate that it isthe ``respirable quartz fraction'' that is to be measured (Ex. 367f, p.9). In response to this comment, OSHA has so identified the measurablefraction in the final rule's Table Z-1-A.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N2; Tr. p. 3-86) believes that the limit for quartz-bearingcoal dust should be reduced to 0.05 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA on the basisof the potential carcinogenicity of respirable crystalline silica. OSHAis aware of some recent studies (NIOSH 1986b; Hurley and Maclaren 1987;IARC 1987) on the health effects of exposure to coal dust, and the Agencyis monitoring this literature to assess the need for a reevaluation ofthis limit.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.1 mg/m\3\,measured as the respirable dust fraction, for coal dust having a respirablequartz fraction of more than 5 percent quartz, and an 8-hour TWA PEL of2 mg/m\3\ TWA, measured as the respirable dust fraction, for coal dusthaving a respirable quartz fraction of less than 5 percent quartz. TheAgency's previous formula limit for silica containing more than 5 percentquartz (respirable fraction) is equivalent to the 0.1-mg/m\3\ limit interms of airborne concentration. Thus, the final rule's limit is intendedto simplify the units used to measure and express the limit; it does notrepresent an actual change in the value of the limit (see discussion forcrystalline silica-quartz later in this section). OSHA believes that thisrevision will simplify employee exposure monitoring.<ITAG tagnum="71">ETHYL ACRYLATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 140-88-5; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>=CHCOOC<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1161</ITAG>OSHA formerly had an 8-hour TWA limit for 25 ppm for ethyl acrylate, witha skin notation. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 5 ppm, a TLV-STEL of 25 ppm,and a skin notation for ethyl acrylate, which is a colorless liquid. Theproposed PEL was an 8-hour TWA of 5 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 25 ppm,with a skin notation; the final rule establishes these limits.Ethyl acrylate produces irritation of the skin, eyes, mucous membranes,gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory system (Dreisbach 1974/Ex. 1-896).The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats fed this substance is 1020 mg/kg, and the 4-hour inhalationLC<T2>50</T2> for these animals ranges between 1000 ppm and 2000 ppm. Inrabbits, the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> is 1790 mg/kg (Pozzani, Weil, and Carpenter 1949/Ex. 1-925),and the minimum oral LD<T2>50</T2> is 280 to 420 mg/kg (Treon, Sigmon, Wright, and Kitzmiller1949/Ex. 1-769). Animal studies also indicate that severe chronic effectsmay result from exposure to this substance. Rats exposed to levels of 70,300, or 540 ppm of ethyl acrylate for up to 30 days showed acceleratedmortality and pathologic changes in the lungs, liver, and kidneys. In thoseanimals that developed pneumonia, renal and hepatic lesions were also seen.In a parallel study, rats, rabbits and guinea pigs who were subjected toethyl acrylate concentrations in excess of 75 ppm for 50 seven-hour inhalationperiods exhibited pulmonary edema; degenerative changes in the heart, liver,and kidneys; and death (Treon, Sigmon, Wright, and Kitzmiller 1949/Ex.1-769). Miller et al. (1980, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 240) reportedthat rats and mice exposed to 75 or 225 ppm, six hours per day for 30 days,developed nasal lesions and other degenerative inflammatory changes inthe nasal structure. In other studies, rats and mice administered 100 or200 mg/kg ethyl acrylate by gavage five times per week for 103 weeks developedinflammation and hyperplasia of the forestomach in addition to squamouscell carcinomas and papillomas in the same area (NTP 1983b, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 240). Based on a study by Miller et al. (1980, ascited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 240), in which rats and mice exposed to25 or 75 ppm ethyl acrylate for six hours per day, five days per week for27 months developed lesions in the nasal cavity even at the lowest dose,the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 240) concurs with the American Industrial HygieneAssociation (1966/Ex. 1-1195) that a 25-ppm limit for ethyl acrylate istoo high to prevent irritating effects in exposed humans.In a study by Nemec and Bauer (1978, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.240), human volunteers experienced drowsiness, headache, and nausea afterprolonged inhalation exposures at 50 to 75 ppm. Opdyke (1975/Ex. 1-922)reported that the application of a 4-percent concentration of ethyl acrylateproduced skin-sensitization reactions in 10 out of 24 volunteers.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B; Tr. pp. 3-97 to 3-98) believes that a fullSection 6(b) rulemaking is needed for this potential occupational carcinogen.A comment from Basic Acrylic Monomer Manufacturers (Ex. 184) urges OSHAnot to adopt values still on the ACGIH <T3>Notice of Intended Changes.</T3> As discussed in Section IV, OSHA isnot adopting these limits.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 5 ppm and a 15-minuteSTEL of 25 ppm for ethyl acrylate; the skin notation is being retained.The Agency concludes that these limits will protect workers from the significantrisk of severe eye, nose, and skin irritation associated with exposureto this substance at the levels permitted by OSHA's former limit.

The ACGIHhas a TLV-TWA limit of 1 mg/m3 with a TLV-STEL of 3 mg/m3; the NIOSH-recommendedexposure limit for metallic vanadium is 1 mg/mg3 as a 10-hour TWA. Theproposed PEL was 1 mg/m3, with a STEL of 3 mg/m3. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) concurred with these limits, which are established by the final rule.Ferrovanadium dust exists as dark, odorless, solid particles.Soviet studies in animals showed ferrovanadium dust to be less toxic thanvanadium pentoxide. Roshchin (1952/Ex. 1-1166) reported that no acute intoxicationoccurred in animals exposed to ferrovanadium dust at concentrations ashigh as 10,000 mg/m3; however, serious chronic pulmonary changes were observedafter short-term exposures (one hour) on alternate days for two monthsto concentrations in the 1000- to 2000-mg/m3 range. These pulmonary changesconsisted of chronic bronchitis and chronic lung inflammation. Only NIOSHcommented on this substance.OSHA is establishing a PEL of 1 mg/m3 TWA and a STEL of 3 mg/m3 for ferrovanadiumdust to reduce the significant risk of chronic pulmonary damage shown tobe associated with exposures to this substance at the elevated short-termlevels formerly permitted by the TWA limit alone. OSHA considers the pulmonarydamage caused by exposure to ferrovanadium dust to be material impairmentsof health. The Agency concludes that the combined TWA limit and STEL willsubstantially reduce this risk.<ITAG tagnum="71">FIBROUS GLASS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: None.

Because of the conflicting nature of some of the evidenceand the complexity of the issues raised, OSHA has not yet been able toreach a final conclusion. Therefore, OSHA is temporarily delaying a finaldecision regarding the establishment of a separate PEL for fibrous glass;however, OSHA will make this final decision within a reasonable periodof time.<ITAG tagnum="71">GRAIN DUST (OAT, WHEAT, AND BARLEY)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: None; Chemical Formula: None</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No.: 1190</ITAG>A decision by the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (<T3>Secretary of Labor </T3>v. <T3>Krause Milling Company, </T3>OSAHRC Docket No. 78-2307, April 22, 1986)has held that there was no former OSHA PEL for grain dust. Based on theACGIH recommendation, OSHA proposed to establish a 4-mg/m3 8-hour TWA PELfor dust generated from wheat, oats, and barley, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) supported the proposal. However, in the final rule the Agency is establishingan 8-hour TWA limit of 10 mg/m3 for these dusts. Grain dusts is a complexmixture of husk particles, cellulose hairs and spikes, starch granules,spores of fungi, insect debris, pollens, rat hair, and approximately 5percent mineral particles. The mean particle size of the airborne dustsmay be less than 5 um. A substantial amount of information was submittedto the record addressing the health evidence and feasibility of attaininga 4-mg/m3 TWA limit in the feed industry (Exs. 3-751, 3-752, 3-755, 8-55,104, 109, 118, 180, 185, and 198; Tr. pp. 6-247 to 6-319). OSHA has carefullyreviewed this evidence and has determined that an exposure limit for graindust is necessary to reduce the significant risk of adverse respiratoryeffects associated with exposure to this material. OSHA's review of thehealth evidence, described below, shows that grain workers will experienceadverse respiratory symptoms upon exposure to grain dust levels exceedingthe current nuisance dust limit of 15 mg/m3 TWA; this observation was notdisputed in the record. Respiratory symptoms are also prevalent among graindust workers exposed to levels below 10 mg/m3 TWA, as total dust, althoughthese symptoms are diminished compared with those associated with exposureto higher dust levels. Because of uncertainties in establishing a clearthreshold exposure level for respiratory effects and in determining thefeasibility of the proposed 4-mg/m3 limit (see Section VII, Summary EconomicImpact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis), OSHA is establishing a 10-mg/m3limit as an 8-hour TWA for wheat, oat, and barley dust to reduce the riskof respiratory disease.The adverse effects of inhaling grain dust have been known for at leasttwo-and-one-half centuries, dating back to Rammazini who, in 1713, describedthe respiratory hazards associated with exposure to cereal grain dust.More recently, several epidemiological studies conducted over the pastfew decades (cited by ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3 and Rankin et al. 1986) have demonstratedthat exposure to grain dust causes ``grain fever,'' wheezing, chest tightness,productive cough, eye and nasal irritation, and symptoms of chronic respiratorydisease. Grain dust may also induce asthmatic reactions via an allergicmechanism, particularly in individuals who are predisposed to developingallergies (i.e. atopic individuals). Thus, OSHA believes that the needfor an occupational limit on exposure to grain dust is clear.The basis for OSHA's proposed 4-mg/m3 limit was a NIOSH-sponsored studyof grain workers by Rankin et al. (<T3>Study of the Prevalence of Chronic, Non-Specific Lung Disease and RelatedHealth Problems in the Grain Handling Industry,</T3> DHHS (NIOSH) Pub.No. 86-117, 1986). A 1980 draft of this study by Rankin and do Pico (Ex.1-1193) formed the basis for the ACGIH-recommended limit of 4 mg/m3 TWA.This study evaluated the health status of 310 grain handlers in Wisconsinand Minnesota. The grain handlers were selected from eight elevator companies,from state grain inspection agencies, and from longshoring companies. Healthstatus was determined by questionnaire and by physical examination, whichincluded an assessment of pulmonary function, immunologic evaluation, bloodand urine chemistries, and chest roentgenograms. The comparison group thatserved as controls consisted of 239 city workers who spent the majorityof their workdays outside.From the questionnaires, Rankin et al. (1986) found that the grain handlershad a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms than did the city workers.The prevalence of respiratory symptoms was highly significant (Rankin etal. 1986, Table 13), and was independent of smoking status. The symptomsreported by grain handlers represented both acute and chronic airways reactions(occupational asthma and chronic bronchitis). Wheezing and/or chest tightnessgenerally started within two hours of beginning the work shift. Episodesof grain fever occurred infrequently; this was attributed by the workersto improved working conditions over the previous three years. Acute recurrentconjunctivitis and rhinitis were reported to occur among most grain workers.Lung function tests showed that exposure to grain dust had a highly significantadverse effect on pulmonary function (Rankin et al. 1986, Table 30). Therewas, however, no correlation between reduced pulmonary function and jobcategory, length of employment, or place of work. The lung function decrementobserved among grain handlers was not related to smoking history alone;grain handlers who were smokers or ex-smokers showed significant declinesin pulmonary function when compared to city workers who were smokers orex-smokers.Grain workers who reported symptoms had lower values of ventilatory functionthan did workers without symptoms. The prevalence of chronic bronchitissymptoms with measured airways obstruction was higher in grain workersthan in controls, regardless of smoking history. Chronic bronchitis withairways obstruction was also related to length of employment. Rankin etal. (1986) concluded that these findings ``suggest that chronic grain dustexposure may result in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' (p. 26).Rankin et al.'s (1986) study also included a work-shift study in which248 grain workers and 192 city workers were sampled for grain dust exposureduring a work shift. Symptoms occurring during the shift were recordedand pulmonary function readings were taken before and after the shift.Only 14 percent of grain workers were exposed to an 8-hour TWA level exceeding5 mg/m3 total grain dust; 7 percent were exposed above 10 mg/m3. Rankinet al. (1986) reported that grain workers showed a significant excess ofcough and expectoration during a work shift in which dust concentrationswere below 5 mg/m3. At dust levels between 10 and 15 mg/m3, there was asignificantly increased prevalence of wheezing and dyspnea during the shiftamong grain workers as compared with controls (Rankin et al. 1986, TableII-156). Workers with pre-existing airways obstruction experienced significantpre- to post-shift declines in ventilatory function at dust levels below10 mg/m3. However, the changes observed in pre- to post-shift pulmonaryfunction did not correlate with the presence of symptoms during the shift.Rankin et al. (1986) also conducted a short-term (three-year) follow-upstudy of lung function among grain workers. Their results showed no greaterdeclines in FEV or FVC over the three-year period than could be accountedfor by age alone. However, there was a significant decline in other measuresof lung function (MMF, V<T2>max50</T2>, V<T2>max75</T2>) among both smoking and nonsmoking grain workers. The authorsconcluded that, although a grain-dust-related decline in these measureswas observed, the long-term effects of smoking on lung function were probablygreater than those caused by grain dust.The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) recommended the 4-mg/m3 TLV based largely on thefollowing conclusion by Rankin et al. (1986):<ITAG tagnum="21">The incidence of respiratory symptoms was higher among grain workersexposed to mean total airborne dust (time-weighted average concentration)of 13.9 mg/m3 when compared to grain workers exposed to 4 mg/m3 or less.In the latter group of grain workers the incidence of symptoms was similarto that found among controls (Rankin et al. 1986, p. 51).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This conclusion by Rankin et al. (1986) was derived by correlatingthe incidence of respiratory symptoms with workers' subjective estimationsof dust levels encountered during the work-shift study; workers who judgedtheir dust exposures during the shift to be ``more than average'' wereexposed to mean dust levels of 13.9andplusmin;12 mg/m3 TWA and had significantlyhigher incidences of respiratory symptoms than did workers who judged theirexposures to be ``average'' (mean TWA dust exposures of 4andplusmin;8.6 mg/m3).From this observation, the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) interpreted 4 mg/m3 tobe a no-observed-effect level.This interpretation of Rankin et al.'s (1986) results was heavily criticizedby rulemaking participants. For example, the National Grain and Feed Association(NGFA) (Ex. 8-55) argued:<ITAG tagnum="21">OSHA states that the study found that acute bronchial symptoms didnot appear among workers exposed at or below 4 mg/m3. This figure is infact an average estimated exposure of 4.21 andplusmin; 8.62 mg/m3 and . .. was based on workers' arbitrary interpretation[s] of `average' exposure.The researchers grossly overstated their results by implying that a specificlevel of 4 mg/m3 was an absolute limit below which the incidence of symptomsamong workers was similar to [that among] controls (Ex. 8-55, p. 28).</ITAG>Although it is true that reliance on employees' subjective impressionsof the magnitude of dust exposure during a shift is not as precise as takingquantitative samples of dust exposure, it must be emphasized that Rankinet al. (1986) did find a significant excess of respiratory symptoms amonggrain workers whose TWA exposures were objectively determined, by air sampling,to be less than or equal to 10 mg/m3 TWA; an excess incidence of wheezingand dyspnea were also reported among grain workers exposed to levels ofbetween 10 and 15 mg/m3 TWA.The NGFA also criticized the Rankin et al. (1986) study for failing toaddress potential biases in the design and administration of the healthquestionnaire (Ex. 8-55, p. 25). In Appendix C of its submission, the NGFAcites a discussion of questionnaire biases by Gamble and Battigelli (in<T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology,</T3> 3rd rev. ed., vol.1, pp. 129-32, Clayton and Clayton 1981) and states that ``questionnairesprovide a large source of error that must be guarded against,'' particularlywhen the questionnaire is self-administered (Ex. 8-55, Appendix C, pp.3-4). OSHA believes that, although such biases are possible, Rankin etal. (1986) took measures to reduce such biases. First, their study populationderives from many workplaces, including eight grain elevators, state graininspection agencies, and longshoring companies; it thus appears unlikelythat the overall results obtained from the questionnaires would be substantiallybiased as a result of employee dissatisfaction with the working conditionsof a particular worksite. Second, Rankin et al. (1986) did rely on trainedinterviewers to review all questionnaires for completeness and to assistin the completion of a questionnaire when necessary. The use of trainedinterviewers, according to Gamble and Battigelli (Ex. 8-55, Appendix C,p. 3), may correct such biases. In addition, Rankin et al. (1986) founda correlation between symptoms reported on questionnaires and exposurelevels, which suggests that the questionnaire results were not heavilybiased.Despite some of the criticisms of the Rankin et al. (1986) study, theseauthors' results are consistent with some other published studies of grainworkers. Dr. Roy Buchan, Chief of the Occupational Health and Safety Section,College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Colorado StateUniversity, performed a study of the general health of 31 grain handlers(submitted as part of Ex. 3-751). A total of 204 personal TWA dust sampleswere taken, of which only six exceeded 10 mg/m3. Dr. Buchan found thatneither age of facility, smoking history, nor past exposure to grain dusthad any significant effect on symptom responses. There was a statisticallysignificant association between grain dust exposure levels and sysmptomresponses. The reported symptoms included nasal and throat irritation,chest discomfort, and phlegm production. Dr. Buchan concluded that, ``althoughthe association was mathematically weak but statistically significant,it would rationally be expected that symptom severity would become morepronounced as dust concentrations increase, since dust exposures in thisinvesitgation were surprisingly low (mean = 0.7 mg/m3 TWA).'' In a largerstudy of 390 Canadian grain workers, Cotton, Graham, Li et al. (1983, submittedas part of Ex. 3-751) also reported a significant excess incidence of respiratorysymptoms among grain workers despite total dust concentrations generallybelow 10 mg/3.Although these studies show a consistent pattern of increased prevalenceof respiratory symptoms among grain handlers exposed below 10 mg/m3, theassociation between low-level exposure to grain dust and the developmentof chronic pulmonary disease remains open to interpretation. Several studies,including Rankin et al. (1986), Chan-Yeung, Giclas, and Henson (1980/Ex.1-474), and Broder, Corey, Davies et al. (1985, as cited in Ex. 3-751)have generally not found decrements in pulmonary function associated withlong-term exposure to grain dust. In addition, chest roentgenograms havefound no evidence of lung scarring of fibrosis (Rankin et al. 1986) amonggrain handlers. However, symptoms of chronic bronchitis have been frequentlynoted among grain handlers, including those who have never smoked (Rankinet al. 1986; Cotton, Graham, Li et al. 1983). According to Cotton et al.(1983, as cited in Ex. 3-751, p. 139), ``The significance of the increasein chronic bronchitis and cough in workers and wheezing in nonsmoking workersin terms of eventual respiratory disability remains uncertain but the nuisanceand discomfort of these symptoms for workers must also be considered.''Because of the conflicting evidence for an association between exposureto grain dust and the development of chronic lung damage, the NGFA (Exs.8-55 and 180) and the American Feed Industry Association (AFIA) (Ex. 185)take the position that grain dust has been shown to be a nuisance dust.For example, in its posthearing brief, the AFIA stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">[F]eed industry workers are generally healthy, and experience no uniqueadverse health effects resulting from current levels of grain dust exposure.Therefore, setting a PEL for grain dust is unwarranted and unnecessary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The studies relied on by OSHA . . . fail to show that grain dust,at current levels, is a ``harmful physical agent''. . . Granted, graindust may have <T3>some</T3> effect on some individuals' health; however, nothing in therecord demonstrates that these effects, at typical current levels, areanything more than reversible and non-serious (Ex. 180, p. 14).</ITAG>OSHA does not concur with this view. In the studies described above, aswell as in others in the record, grain workers have consistently reportedan excess prevalence of respiratory symptoms, including chronic bronchitis,at low levels of exposure to grain dust. OSHA believes that these symptoms,even in the absence of definitive evidence of irreversible lung damage,constitute material impairment of health and interfere with the well-beingof workers. This was attested to at the informal hearing by Deborah Berkowitz,Director of Safety and Health for the Food and Allied Trades Department,AFL-CIO:<ITAG tagnum="21">I want to make it clear that study after study documents a very realacute hazard to grain workers. Living with chronic bronchitis is not ahazard that should go unchecked. In fact, study after study point to thepossibility of very real long-term damage from chronic cumulative effectsof exposure to grain dust. But even without the possibility of long-termdisability, acute hazards clearly pose significant risk[s] to workers (Tr.pp. 6-306 to 6-307)</ITAG>OSHA concludes that employees are placed at significant risk of respiratorysymptoms, including chronic bronchitis, as a result of exposure to graindust. It is clear that such symptoms occur at grain dust levels exceedingOSHA's former limit for dusts and particulates (15 mg/m3 TWA); in addition,workers have reported symptoms of wheezing and dyspnea upon exposure todust levels between 10 and 15 mg/m3 TWA. Increases in respiratory symptomshave also been reported to occur among grain workers exposed generallyto less than 10 mg/m3, although symptoms are diminished at these lowerlevels. At this time, it is difficult to identify the threshold at whichadverse respiratory effects are likely to occur. This uncertainty is reflectedin a posthearing submission by the NGFA (Ex. 118) in which Dr. George Bardwellof the University of Denver performed a statistical analysis of the FEVmeasurements reported by Chan-Yeung, Giclas, and Henson (1980/Ex. 1-474)in grain workers. Dr. Bardwell estimated that the threshold for reducedFEV is 6.41 mg/m3, with a 95-percent confidence interval of between 0 and24.4 mg/m3.In addition, considerable information was entered into the record addressingthe technological feasibility of achieving the proposed 4-mg/m\3\ graindust PEL (Exs. 3-751, 3-752, 3-755, 8-55, 109, 118, 180, 185, and 198).These data are conflicting, particularly with regard to smaller grain elevators.In light of these uncertainties, OSHA is establishing a 10-mg/m\3\ 8-hourTWA limit for grain dust, measured as total dust. OSHA finds that establishingthis limit will substantially reduce the risk of adverse respiratory effectsthat occur at higher levels of exposure. OSHA has also concluded that a10-mg/m\3\ TWA limit is technologically feasible (see Section VII).The American Feed Industry Association (EX. 185) objected to OSHA's inclusionof oat and barley dust in the definition of grain dust, stating that thestudies relied on by OSHA in the NPRM pertaining to oat and barley dust(Darke, Knowelden, Lacey, and Ward 1976; Cockcroft et al. 1983) were notrelevant to addressing the effects of exposure to oat and barley dust atlevels below 15 mg/m\3\. However, Rankin et al. (1986) reported in theirstudy, which involved exposure to much lower levels of grain dust, thatthe types of dust most likely to bring on or aggrevate symptoms of coughand/or expectoration were durum wheat and barley, followed by spring wheat,rye, and oat. Least likely were corn, soybean, sunflower, and others. Inaddition, Mr. George Talley and Mr. Michael Garcia, industrial hygienistsat Los Alamos National Laboratory, commented that, according to their personalexperience, barley beards are more irritating than wheat dust (Ex. 3-1095).Therefore, OSHA finds that there is sufficient evidence to include oatand barley in the definition of grain dust.At the informal hearing, Ms. Berkowitz raised the question as to whetherOSHA intended to apply the grain dust limit to flour mills and bakeries(Tr. 6-310). To support this position, she submitted several reports describingasthma occurring among bakers; bakers' asthma has been attributed to flourdust exposure (Ex. 3-751). As with all other substances included in thisrulemaking, OSHA intends the new limit for grain dust to apply to all workplaces,including flour mills and bakeries where there is the potential for exposureto grain dust.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 mg/m\3\for grain dust, measured as total dust. Grain dusts other than oat, wheat,and barley are regulated under OSHA's generic ``particulates not otherwiseregulated'' PEL of 15 mg/m\3\ (total particulate) and 5 mg/m\3\ (respirablefraction). The Agency concludes that this limit will substantially reducethe significant risk of acute and chronic respiratory symptoms and diseaseassociated with exposure to grain dust at the levels formerly permittedby the absence of an OSHA limit. The Agency has determined that the respiratoryeffects caused by exposure to grain dust represent material impairmentsof health.<ITAG tagnum="71">GRAPHITE, NATURAL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7782-42-5; Chemical Formula: None</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1191</ITAG>The former OSHA limit for natural graphite (total dust) was 15 millionparticles per cubic foot (mppcf), which is equivalent to 2.5 mg/m\3\ asrespirable dust (assuming that respirable mass is one-half total particlemass). The proposed PEL was 2.5 mg/m\3\ for respirable natural graphitedust containing less than 1 percent quartz; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1)concurred with this limit, and the final rule promulgates it. The ACGIHhas a graphite TLV of 2.5 mg/m\3\ for respirable dust containing less than1 percent quartz. Graphite is a mineral substance that is best known forits use as the ``lead'' in pencils.Early reports established that graphite deposited in the lungs of occupationallyexposed workers caused pneumoconiosis (Koopman 1924/Ex. 1-131). Subsequentresearch described the condition produced by exposure to graphite as anthracosilicosis,a pulmonary condition similar to that seen in coal miners, based on radiographicand histologic examinations in exposed individuals (Harding and Oliver1949/Ex. 1-71). The fibrotic changes seen in graphite workers appear tobe related to the silica content of the graphite; experimental animalsthat were administered graphite that did not contain silica did not developfibrotic changes (Ray, King, and Harrison 1951/Ex. 1-46), while anotherstudy found that graphite containing only a small amount of silica producedfibrotic changes in exposed animals (Ottowicz and Paradowski 1961/Ex. 1-190).Radiologic changes were also observed among graphite mine and productionworkers exposed to graphite containing from 3.6 to 10 percent silica (Pendergrass,Vorwald, Mishkin et al. 1967/Ex. 1-77). OSHA received no comments on thissubstance except for those from NIOSH.In the final rule, OSHA is revising its former limit of 15 mppcf to a limitof 2.5 mg/m\3\ for the respirable fraction of graphite containing lessthan 1 percent quartz; this change represents a change only in the unitsused to express or measure the limit, not a change in the value of thelimit. OSHA is revising its limit to simplify the monitoring of employeeexposures, because the use of impingers and microscopic analyses are notrequired to measure exposures that are expressed in mg/m\3\ rather thanin mppcf.<ITAG tagnum="71">INDIUM AND COMPOUNDS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-74-6; Chemical Formula: In</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH recommends that exposures to indiumnot exceed 0.1 mg/m\3\ over an 8-hour shift. Indium metal is silver-white,shiny, and ductile.Although there is no direct human evidence of the effect of indium compounds,severe effects have been produced by indium exposures in experimental animals.Rats that inhaled the sesquioxide form of indium at airborne concentrationsranging from 24 to 97 mg/m3 daily for a total of 224 hours developed widespreadalveolar edema; these histologic lesions did not change over a 12-weekpost-exposure period (Leach, Scott, Armstrong et al. 1961, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 322). Exposure of animals to indium reduces alveolarclearance and may be associated with chronic respiratory insufficiency,recurrent acute pneumonitis, and death (Jones 1960, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 322). NIOSH was the only commenter on this substance. Because of the severity of indium-induced injury and the persistence ofsuch injuries, OSHA concludes that, in the absence of any exposure limit,exposed employees are at significant risk of developing chronic lung functionimpairment. The Agency is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.1 mg/m3for indium and compounds to substantially reduce this risk. <ITAG tagnum="71">IRON OXIDE (DUST AND FUME) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1309-37-1; CHEMICAL FORMULA: Fe<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1215</ITAG>OSHA formerly had an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 mg/m3 for iron oxide fume.The ACGIH has established a limit of 5 mg/m3, measured as iron, total particulate.The proposed PEL was 5 mg/m3, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) supportedthe proposed limit. However, the final rule retains OSHA's former limitof 10 mg/m3 for this substance. The fume of iron oxide is red-brown incolor. Animals exposed to iron oxide or to iron oxide mixed with less than 5 percentsilica by inhalation or by intratracheal injection did not develop pulmonaryfibrosis (Naeslund 1940/Ex. 1-650; Harding, Grout, Durkan et al. 1950,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 325). Inhalation of iron oxide dustalso did not produce lung cancer in mice (Muller and Erhardt 1956/Ex. 1-648).The evidence of iron oxide's toxicity in humans is conflicting. Drinker,Warren, and Page (1935/Ex. 1-315) concluded that exposures to iron oxidefume should be maintained below 10 mg/m3, and a U.S. Department of Laborstudy (1941, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 325) found that exposuresbelow 30 mg/m3 were without adverse effect. There are several studies,on the other hand, that report chest X-ray abnormalities in miners, welders,silver polishers, electrolytic iron oxide workers, foundry workers, andboiler scalers (Doig and McLaughlin 1936/Ex. 1-626; Stewart and Faulds1934/Ex. 1-764; Doig and McLaughlin 1948/Ex. 1-627; McLaughlin, Grout,Barrie, and Harding 1945/Ex. 1-642; Davidson 1951, as cited in McLaughlin1951/Ex. 1-727; Pendergrass and Leopold 1945/Ex. 1-653; Dunner and Hermon1944/Ex. 1-731) exposed to iron oxide dust or fume. Some of these workersdeveloped disabling pneumoconiosis; however, the exposures of many of theseworkers were mixed and in some cases included exposure to varying amountsof silica. McLaughlin (1951/Ex. 1-727), whose opinion on the subject is widely accepted,believes that the presence of iron oxide dust or fume in the lung causesa pigmentation (termed siderosis) that is responsible for the changes seenin exposed individuals' chest X-rays. Siderosis is believed not to progressto fibrosis, and 6 to 10 years of exposure to about 15 mg/m3 iron oxidedust is required before this condition develops (Fawcett 1943/Ex. 1-736;Fleischer, Nelson, and Drinker 1945/Ex. 1-1051; Hamlin and Weber 1950/Ex.1-698). However, no studies are available that correlate exposure levelswith X-ray changes. Dr. Stuart M. Brooks (NIOSH 1986b, p. 425) notes that ``[m]ore sophisticatedphysiologic testing, including measurement of the lung's mechanical properties,is required to better document lung function changes that may occur followinginhalation of iron-containing dusts. <T3>In vitro</T3> studies or animal experimentation might be helpful indetermining dose-response relationships, understanding lung clearance mechanismsfor iron, and elucidating any fibrogenic properties of various ferrouscompounds.'' Some studies have shown that workers with exposures to iron oxide and suchother substances as silica, radon gas, diesel exhaust, corn oils, and thethermal decomposition products of synthetic resins (Faulds 1957/Ex. 1-635;Dreyfus 1936/Ex. 1-897; Bidstrup 1959/Ex. 1-1030; Boyd, Doll, Faulds, andLeiper 1970/Ex. 1-716; Braun, Guillerm, Pierson, and Sadoul 1960/Ex. 1-1141;Monlibert and Roubille 1960/Ex. 1-647; Jorgensen 1973/Ex. 1-1023; Mullerand Erhardt 1956/Ex. 1-648; Koskela, Hernberg, Karava et al. 1976/Ex. 1-744;Gibson, Martin, and Lockington 1977/Ex. 1-1053) have a greater risk ofdeveloping lung cancer. However, OSHA agrees with the ACGIH that, ``atthis time, it is not generally accepted that exposure to iron oxide dustor fume causes cancer in man'' (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 325). Stokinger(1984/Ex. 1-672) concluded that exposure to iron oxide dust and fume <T3>per se</T3> was not carcinogenic. Several industry commenters (Exs. 8-22, 3-349, 3-829, 129, and 188; Tr.XI, pp. 137-138) objected to the proposed reduction in the PEL for ironoxide on the grounds that exposure to this substance does not cause fibrosisor pulmonary impairment, but rather siderosis, which is a benign pneumoconiosis.The American Iron and Steel Institute (Ex. 129, pp. 12-13) described siderosisas ``simply a description of a condition that appears on radiographs.''OSHA disagrees with Mr. Hernandez' assessment of the health effects potentiallyassociated with exposure to iron oxide because the Agency believes thatany occupational exposure that causes foreign substance to lodge in bodytissues is undesirable. However, the Agency concurs with NIOSH's Dr. Brooks(NIOSH 1986b, p. 425) that additional research is necessary to determinewhy the lung is unable to clear iron-containing dusts after inhalation.Accordingly, OSHA finds it appropriate to retain the Agency's former PELfor iron oxide dust and fume of 10 mg/m3, measured as total particulate.The Agency concludes, based on the evidence currently available, that thislimit will protect workers from developing of siderosis, a benign pneumoconiosisthat occurs after many years of exposure to levels of iron oxide dust orfume in excess of 15 mg/m3, and accumulation of iron dust in the lungsassociated with ferric oxide exposure.<ITAG tagnum="71">METHYLENE BIS-(4-CYCLOHEXYLISOCYANATE)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 5124-30-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>15</T2>H<T2>22</T2>N<T2>2</T2>O<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1272</ITAG>OSHA had no former limit for methylene bis-(4-cyclohexylisocyanate). Priorto 1988, the ACGIH had a TLV ceiling of 0.01 ppm for this alicyclic diisocyanatecompound. OSHA proposed a ceiling of 0.01 ppm, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) supported the proposal. The final rule establishes that limit. OSHANotes that ACGIH adopted a new limit for this substance in 1988 of 0.005ppm TWA. The NIOSH RELs for methylene bis-(4-cyclohexylioscyanate) area 0.005-ppm 10-hour TWA and a 0.02-ppm 10-minute ceiling.  Methylene bis-(4-cyclohexylisocyanate) is a pulmonary, skin, and eye irritant.The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is 9.9 g/kg. A 5-percent solution applied to the skinof guinea pigs produced strong erythema and edema, and rabbits treatedwith 0.1 mg showed severe skin reactions (Younger Laboratories 1965, ascited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 392).  Rats inhaling a lethal concentration of 20 ppm for five hours exhibitedmarked respiratory irritation, tremors, and convulsions during exposure,and their lungs revealed severe congestion and edema after death (E.I.du Pont de Nemours and Co. Inc. 1978, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.392). Repeated inhalation exposure at 0.4 ppm produced initial weight lossin rats; exposure at 1.2 ppm caused respiratory irritation and decreasedgrowth (E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. Inc. 1978, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 392). Guinea pigs exposed to 0.12 ppm and mice exposed to 0.65ppm did not exhibit dermal sensitivity (Stadler and Karol 1984/Ex. 1-612).Unlike toluene diisocyanate, which is a sensory irritant, methylene bis(4-cyclohexylisocyanate)depressed respiration by producing pulmonary irritation for example, anexposed mouse showed a 50-percent decrease in respiration rate, along withlung irritation, when exposed to 3.7 ppm of this substance (Weyel and Schaffer1985/Ex. 1-581).  Human exposures to this compound have resulted in skin sensitization butonly infrequently in pulmonary sensitization (Emmett 1976/Ex. 1-552; Israeli,Smirnov, and Sculsky et al. 1981/Ex. 1-701).  NIOSH (Ex. 150, Comments on Methylene Bis-(4-Cyclohexylisocyanate)) notesthat both the REL and TLV for this substance have been based on the toxicologicalproperties of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and that ``a recent study by NTP(1986a) of chronic effects in animals has produced evidence that canceris associated with exposure to commercial grade TDI . . . and to a TDIhydrolysis product, 2,4-TDA . . . treatment of rats and mice of both sexesby gavage to commercial grade TDI resulted in tumor induction, primarilyin the pancreas and liver in male and female rats, and in female mice.The tumorigenic responses observed in both rats and mice treated with TDImeet the criteria of the OSHA cancer policy (29 CFR 1990) for classifyinga substance as a potential occupational carcinogen.'' NIOSH suggests thatthe recommended RELs (0.005 ppm TWA and 0.02 ppm 10-minute ceiling) beconsidered as an interim level to be applied to methylene bis-(4-cyclohexylisocyanate)until adequate testing information is available. The AFL-CIO (Ex. 194)supported OSHA's proposed ceiling limit for this substance.  OSHA believes that a ceiling limit of 0.01 ppm is as protective as a 0.005-ppmTWA; the Agency therefore is establishing a ceiling limit of 0.01 ppm formethylene bis-(4-cyclohexylisocyanate). The Agency concludes that thislimit will protect workers against the significant risk of eye, skin, andpulmonary irritation potentially associated with occupational exposuresto this substance at the levels formerly permitted by the absence of anOSHA limit. The Agency considers these irritant effects caused by exposureto methylene bis-(4-cyclohexylisocyanate) to be material impairments ofhealth.<ITAG tagnum="71">MICA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 12001-26-2; Chemical Formula: K<T2>2</T2>A1<T2>4</T2>(A1<T2>2</T2>Si<T2>6</T2>O<T2>20</T2>)(OH)<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Because of the conflicting nature of some of the evidenceand the complexity of the issues raised, OSHA has not yet been able toreach a final conclusion. Therefore, OSHA is temporarily delaying a finaldecision regarding the establishment of a separate PEL for mineral woolfiber; however, OSHA will make this final decision within a reasonableperiod of time.<ITAG tagnum="71">NICKEL (SOLUBLE COMPOUNDS)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"> CAS: 7440-02-0; Chemical Formula: Varies</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1283</ITAG>The former OSHA PEL for all forms of inorganic nickel (as Ni) was 1 mg/m3TWA. Based on the ACGIH recommendation, OSHA proposed revising this limitto 0.1 mg/m3 TWA; this limit is established in the final rule. NIOSH recommendsthat exposure to any form of inorganic nickel be maintained at or below0.015 mg/m3.A variety of toxic effects results from exposure to nickel compounds. Solublenickel salts cause contact dermatitis in sensitized individuals and eyeirritation (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 422). Cases of asthmatic lung diseasehave been reported among nickel-plating workers (EPA 1986a/Ex. 1-1132).OSHA's proposal to lower the PEL for soluble nickel compounds to 0.1 mg/m3was based primarily on evidence that exposure to soluble nickel at lowlevels and for relatively short durations causes pathological changes inthe lungs of experimental animals. In addition, OSHA reviewed several animaland human studies designed to investigate the carcinogenic potential ofsoluble nickel compounds. Three soluble nickel compounds have been testedfor their carcinogenic potential: nickel chloride, nickel sulfate, andnickel acetate. Some sparingly soluble compounds, nickel carbonate andnickel hydroxide, have also been studied.The results of animal studies suggest that some soluble nickel compoundsare potentially carcinogenic; however the data are derived predominatelyfrom injection studies and results are conflicting. Results from occupationalstudies on soluble nickel compounds are also conflicting and are confoundedby the presence of several types of nickel compounds in the facilitiesstudied.In the proposal, OSHA made a preliminary finding that exposure to solublenickel compounds presented a potential cancer mortality risk to workers.Since publication of the proposal, however, OSHA has reviewed all of therecord evidence, including an additional epidemiologic study, and has determinedthat further analysis is necessary before any definitive findings can bemade with regard to the carcinogenic potential of the soluble nickel compounds.OSHA wishes to emphasize, however, that this determination does not negatethe evidence that exposure of experimental animals to low levels of solublenickel causes pathological changes in the lung. Accordingly, OSHA is establishingthe 0.1-mg/m3 TWA PEL in the final rule, as proposed, but is basing thislimit on the respiratory toxicity of these compounds. OSHA's findings onthe evidence on soluble nickel compounds is presented below.Bingham, Barkley, Zerwas et al. (1972/Ex. 1-204) exposed rats by inhalationto 0.1 mg/m3 nickel chloride for 12 hours per day for two weeks. Animalsshowed evidence of pulmonary irritation and damage in the form of markedmucous secretion, hyperplasia, and accumulations of alveolar macrophages.Fluid obtained by lung lavage appeared very cloudy and viscous due to thepresence of free alveolar cells. Rats and guinea pigs exposed daily to1.0 mg/m3 (as Ni) nickel chloride for six months showed increased lungweight, which is an indication of pulmonary damage and hyperplasia (Clary1977, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 422); exposed rats also developedsigns of interstitial fibrotic lesions. Rabbits inhaling 0.3 mg/m3 (asNi) nickel chloride aerosol for 30 days showed a doubling in alveolar cellnumber and volume of alveolar epithelial cells, as well as nodular accumulationof macrophages and laminated structures (Johansson, Curstedt, Robertson,and Camner 1983/Ex. 1-273). These studies clearly show that exposure ator below the former OSHA PEL of 1.0 mg/m3 for soluble nickel, even fordurations considerably less than a working lifetime, is associated withincreased cell turnover and pathological changes in the lung. These pathologicalchanges, in particular the appearance of fibrotic lesions, observed inanimals exposed to low levels of soluble nickel salts indicate that lungdamage has occurred and suggests that significant decrements in lung functionmay result from prolonged exposure to these low levels. Furthermore, theappearance of hyperplasia is indicative of abnormal cell growth and suggeststhe presence of pre-cancerous lesions.Nickel chloride has been reported to be mutagenic in<T3> Salmonella typhimurium</T3> and<T3> Cornebacterium,</T3> but negative in<T3> E. coli</T3> (EPA 1986a/Ex. 1-1132). The positive studies are notconsidered conclusive, however, because the<T3> S. typhimurium</T3> report is an abstract lacking detailed data and<T3> Cornebacterium</T3> is not the usual species used in these tests.Amacher and Paillet (1980/Ex. 1-286) reported that nickel chloride wasmutagenic in mouse lymphoma cells and demonstrated a dose-response relationshipfor this endpoint.Some<T3> in vitro</T3> studies using soluble nickel compounds report findingchromosomal aberrations (EPA 1986a/Ex. 1-1132). These studies do not demonstratea dose-response relationship or statistical significance, which weakenstheir findings. Several<T3> in vivo</T3> studies have failed to detect chromosomal aberrations(EPA 1986a/Ex. 1-1132). However, several<T3> in vitro</T3> studies on nickel sulfate and nickel chloride have reportedfindings of sister chromatid exchanges (EPA 1986a/Ex. 1-1132).Some animal studies on soluble nickel compounds suggest that these compoundsare carcinogenic in animals. Strain A mice receiving intraperitoneal injectionsof nickel acetate had an increased rate of lung adenomas and adenocarcinomasthat was statistically significant in the high-dose group (Stoner, Shimkin,Troxell et al. 1976/Ex. 1-203). The animals were injected three times perweek for eight weeks at 72, 180, or 360 mg/kg.EPA (1986a/Ex. 1-1132) reported a study in which rats were given monthlyintramuscular injections of 35 mg/kg nickel acetate for four to six months(Haro, Furst, and Falk 1968/Ex. 1-1022). Twenty-two percent of the treatedrats developed sarcomas. Payne (1964/Ex. 1-200) observed tumor responsesin rats after intramuscular implantation of 7 mg nickel acetate, nickelsulfate, nickel chloride, or nickel carbonate. Implant-site sarcomas developedin one of 35 rats exposed to nickel acetate, one of 35 rats exposed tonickel sulfate, none of 35 rats exposed to nickel chloride, and four of35 rats exposed to nickel carbonate.Results of other studies on nickel sulfate have been negative. Three studiesused intramuscular injection in rats and reported that no tumors developedin the treated group (Gilman 1962/Ex. 1-205; Gilman 1966, as cited in EPA1986/Ex. 1-1132; Kasprzak, Gabryel, and Jaraczewska 1983/Ex. 1-201). Aningestion study also repoted no tumors among treated rats or dogs (Ambrose,Larson, Borzelleca et al. 1976/Ex. 1-211).Gilman (1966, as cited in EPA 1986a/Ex. 1-1132) administered 5 mg nickelhydroxide to rats by intramuscular injection in each thigh. Nineteen outof 40 injection sites developed sarcomas. Kasprzak, Gabryel, and Jaraczewska(1983/Ex. 1-201) gave rats intramuscular injections of nickel hydroxidein gel, crystalline, or colloidal form. Five out of 19 animals receivingthe gel developed sarcomas (two with metastasis to the lung), three outof 20 receiving the crystalline form developed sarcomas (one with metastasisto the lung), and none of 13 rats receiving the colloid developed tumors.Inco United States, Inc. (with its subsidiary, Inco Ltd.) (Exs. 3-915 and167) and the Nickel Producers Environmental Research Association (NiPERA),Inc. (Ex 3-668) discussed the limitations of the animal data. For example,both of these commenters noted that soluble nickel compounds have producedtumors in animals only by injection and that the results among studieswere conflicting. In the NPRM and in the discussion above, OSHA recognizedmany of these limitations of the data. Although it is true, as Inco pointedout (Exs. 3-915 and 167), that EPA (1986a/Ex. 1-1132) concluded that theanimal data are ``too limited to support any definitive judgment regarding* * * [the] carcinogenic potential [of soluble nickel compounds]'' (EPA1986a/Ex. 1-1132, p. 8-229), EPA also concluded that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The observation of pulmonary tumors in strain A mice from the administrationof nickel acetate by intraperitioneal injections and the ability of nickelacetate to transform mammalian cells in culture and to inhibit RNA andDNA synthesis provides limited evidence for the carcinogenicity of nickelacetate and supports a concern for the carcinogenic potential of othersoluble nickel compounds (EPA 1986a/Ex. 1-1132, p. 8-229).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">OSHA agrees with EPA's assessment that, although some studies aresuggestive of a carcinogenic effect and an ability of soluble nickel totransform cells, overall the animal data are too equivocal at this timeto support any firm conclusions that soluble nickel compounds do or donot cause cancer in experimental animals.In addition to the animal evidence described above, OSHA reviewed studiesconducted on workers exposed to soluble nickel compounds. Electrolysisworkers at a refinery in Kristiansand, Norway, experienced a higher lungcancer risk than employees from the same facility who worked in three otherjob categories, including roasting and smelting workers (Magnus, Andersen,and Hogetveit 1982/Ex. 1-241). Electrolysis workers were exposed to anaerosol composed predominantly of nickel sulfate, which was estimated tocontain soluble nickel at a concentration of 0.2 mg/m\3\ (EPA 1986a/Ex.1-1132); these workers also had higher plasma and urine levels of nickelthan did roasting and smelting workers, who were predominately exposedto insoluble nickel subsulfides and oxides. However, exposure to nickelsubsulfide and oxides may have occurred in the electrolysis buildings,and the electrolysis workers may also have worked in other process departments(Grandjean, Andersen, and Nielsen 1988/Ex 1-207). Roasting and smeltingworkers were exposed to an estimated average of 0.5 mg/m3 (as Ni) of roastingdust.The standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for lung cancer were 550 for electrolysisworkers, 390 for other process workers, and 360 for roasting and smeltingworkers. The pattern of SMRs for nasal cancer, which is a rare form ofcancer in humans, was different among these groups: 2600 for electrolysisworkers, 2000 for other process workers, and 4000 for roasting and smeltingworkers. The results seem consistent with studies that show that roastingand smelting workers have the highest concentrations of nickel in the nasalmucosa, presumably because of the relatively larger particles resultingfrom roasting. Conversely, electrolysis workers, who showed a larger lungcancer risk than roasting and smelting workers, have higher plasma andurine levels of nickel, suggesting that nickel aerosolized by this processpentrates to the deep lung (EPA 1986a/Ex. 1-1132).In the NPRM, OSHA presented quantitative estimates of the cancer risk believedto be associated with exposure to soluble nickel; these estimates werebased on the Magnus at al. (1983/Ex. 1-241) study of electrolysis workers.During the rulemaking proceeding, OSHA re-evaluated the underlying exposuredata and now believes that, because the electrolysis workers may have beenconcurrently exposed to some insoluble forms of nickel, the data from theMagnus et al. (1982/Ex. 1-241) study may not be appropriate to use to developa quantitative estimate of the cancer risk associated with exposure tothe insoluble forms on nickel.In contrast to the study of Norwegian nickel refinery workers, a studyof 4,288 refinery workers at Port Colborne, Ontario, failed to find anincreased lung or nasal cancer mortality rate among electrolysis workers(Roberts et al. 1982; Roberts et al. 1984). Excess incidences of larynxand kidney cancer deaths were reported to be elevated among electrolysisworkers, but the numbers of observed deaths were small (two deaths observedfor each cause of death). The Roberts et al. studies did report substantiallyincreased incidences of lung and nasal cancer deaths among sinter plantworkers exposed to insoluble forms of nickel, a finding consistent withthat of Magnus et al. (1982/Ex./1-241) for the Norwegian workers and withmany other studies (EPA 1986a/Ex./1-1132).The stark contrast between these two studies is difficult to explain. Accordingto Inco (Ex./3-915, p. 5), exposures to soluble nickel at the Ontario facility,where no excess risk was found among electrolysis workers, were probablysimilar to those at the Norwegian facility, where cancer mortality wasincreased. Exposure data taken during the late 1970s at the Ontario facility(Ex./3-915, Table 1c) indicate that, in most job categories, electrolysisworkers were exposed to both soluble and insoluble forms of nickel; thisis evidenced by the higher reported employee sampling results for totalnickel than for soluble nickel. Thus, concurrent exposure to both solubleand insoluble forms of nickel existed at both the Ontario and Norwegianfacilities. The size of the cohort at the Ontario facility was approximatelytwice that of the Norwegian study; thus, the Ontario study has sufficientpower to detect the sizable increases in the incidences of nasal and lungcancer that were reported in the Norwegian study. It is possible, as EPA(1986a/Ex./1-1132) has suggested, that quantitative or qualitative differencesin the conditions of exposure between the two cohorts accounts for thediscrepant results; however, no information contained in the Ontario orNorwegian reports suggest that there were substantial differences in exposureto soluble nickel. Given the magnitude of the difference in the reportedcancer mortality for these two groups of electrolysis workers, it is clearthat additional investigation is required to identify the risk factorsthat account for the different mortality patterns observed in Ontario andNorway. Therefore, OSHA concludes that, at this time, the available humandata do not permit any definitive conclusion to be made linking occupationalexposure to the soluble forms of nickel with an elevated cancer mortalityrisk in humans.The primary impetus to revise the PEL for soluble nickel was the findingthat exposure of animals for relatively short periods of time to solublenickel aerosols at levels equal to or below the former PEL of 1 mg/m3 producedincreased cellular growth and pathological changes that reflect the lung'sdefense against chemical insult; this finding is consistent across threeanimal studies conducted in several species (Bingham, Barkley, Zerwas etal. 1972/Ex./1-204; Clary 1977, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex./1-3, p. 422;Johansson, Curstedt, Robertson, and Camner 1983/Ex./1-273). Furthermore,these observations were made in animals that were exposed for as shorta duration as two weeks and for no more than six months; thus, the consequencesof continued, low-level exposure for a full lifetime are unknown. BothInco (Exs. 3-915 and 167) and NiPERA, Inc. (Ex./3-668) agree that thesestudies provide an appropriate basis for establishing a 0.1-mg/m3 PEL forsoluble nickel. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B) does not concur with the selectionof this limit and believes that a full 6(b) rulemaking is appropriate forthe soluble (or inorganic) compounds of nickel.OSHA concludes that these studies, one of which demonstrated pathologicaland perhaps precancerous changes following exposure to 0.1 mg/m3, clearlydemonstrate that exposure to the former PEL of 1.0 mg/m3 presents a significantrisk to workers of lung irritation accompanied by pathological changesthat may presage cancer. OSHA has determined that these effects constitutematerial impairments of health and functional capacity. OSHA also concludesthat the final rule's reduction in the PEL will substantially reduce thesesignificant risks. Accordingly, OSHA is establishing a revised 8-hour TWAPEL of 0.1 mg/m3 (as Ni) for the soluble nickel compounds in the finalrule.<ITAG tagnum="71">NITROGEN DIOXIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 10102-44-0; Chemical Formula: NO<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1289</ITAG>Both the ACGIH and NIOSH have recommended occupational limits for nitrogendioxide. The current ACGIH recommendation is for a 3-ppm TWA and a 5-ppmSTEL. The NIOSH REL is 1 ppm as a 15-minute short-term limit. OSHA's formerPEL was 5 ppm as a ceiling value. The Agency proposed, and the final ruleestablishes, a permissible exposure limit for nitrogen dioxide of 1 ppmas a 15-minute STEL. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) agreed with the selectionof this PEL. Nitrogen dioxide is a reddish-brown gas.The previous ACGIH TLV of 5 ppm as a ceiling concentration (the basis forthe former OSHA limit) was based primarily on the animal studies of Gray,MacNamee, and Goldberg (1952/Ex.1-154), Gray, Goldberg, and Patton (1954/Ex.1-165), and Wagner, Duncan, Wright, and Stokinger (1965/Ex. 1-102). Gray,MacNamee, and Goldberg (1952/Ex. 1-154), and Gray, Goldberg and Patton(1954/Ex. 1-165) demonstrated lung injury among rats exposed for eightor more weeks to an 8-ppm concentration of a mixture of NO<T2>2</T2> and nitric acid, but these authors did not see such lesionsin rats exposed for six months to 4-ppm concentrations of this mixture.Wagner, Duncan, Wright, and Stokinger (1965/Ex. 1-102) reported transient,mild, acute effects but no adverse chronic effects in rats exposed to 1ppm, 5 ppm, or 25 ppm pure NO<T2>2</T2> for 18 months. The ACGIH's recommendation that the 5-ppm TLVbe defined as a ceiling rather than as an 8-hour TWA was based on reportsthat NO<T2>2</T2> accelerated lung tumor development among lung-tumor-susceptiblemice; in the late 1960s, the ACGIH believed that a TLV-ceiling value wouldminimize the risk of accelerating lung tumor development.The current ACGIH TLVs for NO<T2>2</T2> are a 3-ppm 8-hour TWA and a 5-ppm STEL, and they are basedon human studies that indicate that normal respiratory function may becompromised at exposures below the current OSHA ceiling limit of 5 ppmNO<T2>2</T2>. In particular, Kosmider, Ludyga, Misiewicz et al. (1972/Ex.1-224) reported a slight reduction in vital capacity and maximum respiratoryvolume in 70 men exposed to 0.4- to 2.7-ppm concentrations of the oxidesof nitrogen six to eight hours daily for four to six years. These authorsalso reported an unspecified number of cases of chronic bronchitis amongmen in this group. Another study by Vigdortschik, Ancheeva, Matussevistchet al. (1937/Ex. 1-49) reported possible cases of chronic bronchitis andemphysema among 127 workers generally exposed below 2.8 ppm NO<T2>2</T2>; these workers were also believed to be exposed to sulfuricacid mist at levels sufficient to cause dental erosion.The NIOSH REL for NO<T2>2</T2> of 1 ppm as a 15-minute STEL is based on the two human studiesdiscussed above, as well as some human studies involving short-term exposure.Abe (1967/Ex. 1-98) found a 40-percent decrease in effective lung capacityamong healthy adult males 30 minutes after a 10-minute exposure to 4- to5-ppm NO<T2>2</T2>. Expiratory and inspiratory maximum viscous resistance alsoincreased by 92 percent after exposure. NIOSH (1976j/Ex. 1-265) concludedthat Abe's results ``document a definite and undesirable effect'' at exposuresapproaching the former OSHA limit. A significant decrease in carbon monoxidediffusing capacity was observed by Von Nieding, Krekeler, Fuchs et al.(1973/Ex. 1-770) in healthy adults exposed to 5 ppm for 15 minutes. NIOSHalso cites the work of Von Nieding, Wagner, Krekeler et al. (1971/Ex. 1-1204)and by Von Nieding and Krekeler (1971/Ex. 1-1175), who reported significantincreases in airway resistance among 88 chronic bronchitis patients aftera 15-minute exposure to a concentration of NO<T2>2</T2> as low as 1.5 ppm. NIOSH (1976j/Ex-1-265) concluded that thespecific concentration of NO<T2>2</T2> required to produce pulmonary changes in normal, healthy adultsis unknown, but ``is likely to be about the same or perhaps a slightlyhigher concentration than the one inducing pulmonary changes in humanswith existing chronic bronchitis'' (1.5 ppm). Therefore, NIOSH recommendeda 1-ppm 15-minute short-term limit for nitrogen dioxide. To provide additionalsupport for a short-term rather than a TWA limit, NIOSH cites several animalstudies that indicate that the toxic effects associated with exposure toNO<T2>2</T2> are primarily determined by peak, and not average, concentrationsof exposure.In its posthearing submission, NIOSH (Ex. 150, Comments on Nitrogen Dioxide)reported on a recent study by Mohsenin (1988, as cited in Ex. 150) in whichno significant pulmonary function changes were noted among 18 healthy subjectsexposed to NO<T2>2</T2> for one-hour periods. NIOSH (Ex. 150) noted that, in 1984, theWorld Health Organization, after an independent review of cross-sectionaloccupational health surveys, recommended a short-term occupational exposurelimit of 1.8 mg/m3 (0.9 ppm) for NO<T2>2</T2> and 8-hour TWA limit of 0.9 mg/m3 (0.45 ppm). NIOSH also reviewedstudies that suggest that NO<T2>2</T2> is mutagenic and is embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats.The AFL-CIO (Ex. 194) supported OSHA's proposed limit for NO<T2>2</T2>. However, several commenters (Exs. 3-349, 3-670, 3-739, 3-666,3-1144, 133, and 133A) objected to OSHA's proposal to establish the NIOSHREL for NO<T2>2</T2> in the final rule, believing that the ACGIH TLVs of 3 ppm TWAand 5 ppm STEL were sufficiently protective. For example, David L. VanLewen, Manager of Industrial Hygiene for BASF, referred to the Von Niedinget al. (1971/Ex. 1-1204) study as evidence that a 1-ppm short-term limitwas not necessary:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Von Nieding study (1971/Ex. 1-1204) of chronic bronchitis patients. . . showed increased airway resistance when exposed to concentrationsof nitrogen dioxide between 1.5 and 5.0 ppm. Lower concentrations had nosignificant effect. When this sensitive population does not show significanteffects at concentrations below 1.5 ppm, it is not reasonable to set aworkplace limit at a STEL of 1.0 ppm (Ex. 3-666).</ITAG>Mr. Lawrence J. Ogden, representing the Interstate Natural Gas Associationof America (INGAA) (Ex. 3-739), and Mr. Vincent D. Lajiness of the AmericanNatural Resources Company (ANR) (Ex. 3-670) criticized the studies describedin the NPRM, and in particular the Von Nieding et al. (1971/Ex. 1-1204)study; both rulemaking participants indicated that the data base developedby EPA to establish EPA's ambient air quality limit for NO<T2>2</T2> is superior. Mr. Ogden stated that<ITAG tagnum="21">[a] far more extensive body of studies about NO<T2>2</T2> health effects is available than is cited by OSHA in the proposedrulemaking. Much of this literature has been pulled together by the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA).

As a result of its evaluation, EPA decided in 1982 thatevidence was insufficient that a short-term air standard for NO<T2>2</T2> was needed. This conclusion has been re-examined annually byEPA and checked against the latest health studies related to NO<T2>2</T2> effects (Ex. 3-739, pp. 7, 10).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Mr. Ogden also referred OSHA to the 1979 National Academy of Science'sCommittee on Toxicology report on the health evidence for NO<T2>2</T2>.The EPA staff memorandum referred to by Mr. Ogden is the 1982 Office ofAir Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) Staff Paper on the assessmentof scientific information on NO<T2>2</T2> (EPA/450/5-82/002, Ex. 3-2e). This document summarizes the findingsexpressed in EPA's <T3>Air Quality Criteria for Oxides of Nitrogen </T3>(EPA/600/8-82/026,Ex. 3-2f). Based on these reports, EPA issued a final rule retaining its1971 ambient air quality standard for NO<T2>2</T2>, which is 0.053 ppm (100 mg/m3) as averaged over a one-yearperiod.The EPA Staff Paper concludes that the 1971 Von Nieding et al. (Ex. 1-1204)study ``provides convincing evidence that chronic bronchitics exposed toNO<T2>2</T2> concentrations of 1.6 ppm or greater for approximately 3 minutesexperience increases in airway resistance'' (Ex. 3-2e, p. 18). A numberof other studies were cited by EPA in which healthy adults were exposedto NO<T2>2</T2> concentrations in the range of 0.5 to 2.5 ppm. Folinsbee, Horvath,Bedi, and Delehunt (1978, as cited in Ex. 3-2e) reported no significantphysiological changes in healthy adults exercising for up to one hour duringa two-hour exposure to 0.6 ppm NO<T2>2</T2>. Suzuki and Ishikawa (1965, as cited in Ex. 3-2e) reported a50-percent increase in inspiratory flow resistance in healthy adults 10minutes after a 10-minute exposure to an NO<T2>2</T2> concentration between 0.7 and 2 ppm.Small changes in pulmonary function and a slight increase in the prevalenceof respiratory symptoms occurred among healthy adults exposed to 1 ppmNO<T2>2</T2> for two hours (Hackney, Thiede, Linn et al. 1978, as cited inEx. 3-2e). Beil and Ulmer (1976, as cited in Ex. 3-2e) reported a statisticallysignificant increase in airway resistance among healthy adults followingexposure to 2.5 ppm NO<T2>2</T2> for two hours, but not following exposure to 1 ppm. Based ontheir review of these data, the EPA staff paper concluded:<ITAG tagnum="21">[T]he lowest level of NO<T2>2</T2> exposure that credible studies have associated with measureableimpairment of pulmonary function appears to be in the range of 1.0-1.6ppm. . . . Several CASAC members have expressed concern that a standarddesigned to prevent relatively small changes in pulmonary function (suchas those observed in the Suzuki and Ishikawa (1965) and Von Nieding etal. (1971) studies) from occurring more than once per year would be unnecessarilystringent. The CASAC members indicated that they were more concerned aboutthe health implications of repeated exposures to the peak concentrationsobserved in the two studies than the effects associated with a single exposure(Ex. 3-2e, p. 18).</ITAG>EPA also reviewed research reports that have become available since publicationof the EPA Criteria Document and Staff Paper, in particular the reportsby Linn and Hackney (1983 and 1984) that reported finding no pulmonaryeffects among exercising healthy adults and asthmatics exposed to 4 ppmNO<T2>2</T2>. EPA concluded that these studies present ``mixed and conflictingresults,'' and that a more complete assessment of these studies was notpossible because ``many * * * have yet to be published in the peer-reviewedscientific literature'' (50 <T3>FR </T3>25535/Ex. 3-2d).Regarding EPA's decision not to issue a short-term ambient-air-qualitylimit for NO<T2>2</T2>, a review of the preamble to EPA's final rule shows that EPAaddressed this issue only with regard to existing <T3>ambient </T3>short-term levels of NO<T2>2</T2>. EPA reported that, under its current 0.053-ppm annual averagelimit, the vast majority of metropolitan areas would be expected to havefewer than two days with a daily maximum hourly value of 0.2 ppm or greater(50 <T3>FR </T3>25536/Ex. 3-2d). Because of the uncertainties regarding theevidence for adverse effects at NO<T2>2</T2> concentrations below 1 ppm, EPA concluded that the current annualaverage limit would ``provide some measure of protection against possibleshort-term health and welfare effects'' (50 <T3>FR </T3>25537/Ex. 3-2d). It is also worth noting that, since 1971,EPA has designated a 2-ppm (one-hour average) level for NO<T2>2</T2> as representing a ``significant harm level'' requiring an emergencyresponse. Thus, OSHA finds that EPA's recent actions and reasoning regardinga short-term ambient limit for NO<T2>2</T2> supports the establishment of 1 ppm as a STEL.OSHA has also reviewed the most recent analysis of NO<T2>2</T2> toxicity conducted by the National Academy of Science's (NAS)Committee on Toxicology for the Department of Defense (<T3>Emergency and Continuous Exposure Guidance Levels for Selected AirborneContaminants, </T3>Vol. 4, pp. 83-96, National Academy Press 1985); theearlier 1979 review was cited by Mr. Ogden of the INGAA. In its more recentreview, the NAS concluded that exposures to NO<T2>2</T2> at levels between 0.5 and 1.5 ppm have demonstrated ``littleor no persistent change in pulmonary function'' (NAS 1985, p. 89). TheNAS Committee on Toxicology recommended short-term public emergency guidancelevels (SPEGLs) for NO<T2>2</T2> of 1 ppm, averaged over a 60-minute period, and 0.12 ppm asan 8-hour average.OSHA concludes that the evidence reviewed by the EPA and the NAS and theseveral studies referenced by EPA and NAS reaffirm the conclusion expressedby NIOSH in its 1976 criteria document (NIOSH 1976j/Ex. 1-265) that ``humanswith normal respiratory function may be acutely affected by exposure [toNO<T2>2</T2>] at or below . . . [5 ppm]. Furthermore, the conditions of workerswith chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic bronchitis, may be aggravatedby exposure to nitrogen dioxide at a concentration of approximately one-thirdof the current Federal standard'' (NIOSH 1976j/Ex. 1-265, p. 117). In additionto the studies by Von Nieding et al. (1971/Ex. 1-1204) and Abe (1967/Ex.1-98) described in the NPRM, both EPA (Ex. 3-2e) and the NAS (1985) citea number of other published reports that show that exposure to NO<T2>2</T2> at concentrations below 5 ppm causes increased airway resistancein both healthy adults and chronic bronchitis; these reports include thestudies of Suzuki and Ishikawa (1965), Rokaw et al. (1968), Streseman andVon Nieding (1970), and Beil and Ulmer (1976). Furthermore, these and otherstudies cited by EPA (Ex. 3-2e) and the NAS (1985) generally indicate thatexposure to 1 ppm NO<T2>2</T2> is not normally associated with significant airway resistance,even among workers with already-compromised respiratory function.Thus, OSHA concludes that the former 5-ppm ceiling limit for NO<T2>2</T2> is not sufficient to protect employees from experiencing increasedairway resistance, and that establishing the ACGIH TLVs of 3 ppm TWA and5 ppm STEL, as suggested by rulemaking participants (Exs. 3-349, 3-670,3-739, 3-666, and 3-1144), would not provide sufficient protection. OSHAalso concludes that the risk of increased airway resistance would be substantiallyreduced by promulgation of a 1-ppm short-term limit for NO<T2>2</T2>; a short-term limit is clearly indicated for NO<T2>2</T2> since all of the studies cited above demonstrate that increasedairway resistance is associated with exposure to NO<T2>2</T2> for durations of between three minutes and two hours. OSHA considersthe increased airways resistance caused by exposure to NO<T2>2</T2> to be a material impairment of health. Therefore, to reducethe significant risk associated with short-term exposure to NO<T2>2</T2>, the agency is establishing a 1-ppm limit, averaged over a 15-minuteperiod, for nitrogen dioxide in the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="71">OXYGEN DIFLUORIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7783-41-7; Chemical Formula: OF<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1300</ITAG>The former PEL for oxygen difluoride was 0.05 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. TheACGIH has established a limit of 0.05 ppm as a ceiling value. The revisionof the TLV for oxygen difluoride from an 8-hour TWA to a ceiling valuereflects the general position of the ACGIH that ceiling TLVs are more appropriatefor chemicals that cause acute but not chronic health effects. OSHA proposeda permissible exposure limit of 0.05 ppm ceiling for oxygen difluoride.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with the selection of this limit,and it is established in the final rule. Oxygen difluoride is an unstable,colorless gas with a foul odor.Oxygen difluoride is a substance having extremely high acute toxicity;it is an acute irritant and causes fatal pulmonary edema and hemorrhagein animals exposed to 0.5 ppm for a few hours (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3). A singleexposure to 0.1 ppm also had an effect on the lungs, as evidenced by developmentin animals of a tolerance to the acute effects of this substance afteran isolated exposure. Animals acutely exposed to oxygen difluoride havealso exhibited gross changes in the kidneys and internal genitalia (LaBelle,Metcalf, Suter, and Smith 1945, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 452;Lester and Adams 1965/Ex. 1-963). Only NIOSH commented on this substance.Because of the extreme acute toxicity of this compound and the effectsnoted at 0.1 ppm, the former TWA-PEL of 0.05 ppm was not sufficiently protectiveof workers; this former limit would still permit the brief periods of highexposure that have been associated with severe lung damage, which the Agencyhas determined represents a material impairment of health. Therefore, toreduce the significant risk of acute lung damage associated with briefexcursion exposures to oxygen difluoride, OSHA is establishing a ceilinglimit of 0.05 ppm for this substance.<ITAG tagnum="71">OZONE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 10028-15-6; Chemical Formula: O<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1301</ITAG>The former OSHA PEL for ozone was 0.1 ppm TWA. In the interval since thislimit was adopted in 1971, the ACGIH has recommended that 15-minute short-termexposures to ozone not exceed 0.3 ppm. NIOSH has no REL for ozone. OSHAproposed, and the final rule establishes, permissible exposure limits of0.1 ppm TWA and 0.3 ppm STEL for ozone. The Agency notes that the ACGIHhas placed ozone on its <T3>1988-89 Notice of Intended Changes </T3>and is proposing a new TLVof 0.1 ppm as a ceiling value. Ozone is a liquid or an explosive gas.Ozone is highly injurious and lethal in experimental animals at concentrationsas low as a few parts per million (Stokinger 1957/Ex. 1-97). A study inwhich young mice were exposed to 1 ppm ozone for one or two days reporteddamage to alveolar tissue (Bils 1970/Ex. 1-58). Human populations chronicallyexposed to lower concentrations of ozone have been observed to have changesin lung function. In one study, human volunteers exposed to 0.5 ppm ozonefor three hours per day, six days per week, for 12 weeks showed significantchanges in lung function (Jaffe 1967/Ex. 1-101). Other authors reporteda 20-percent reduction in timed vital capacity in persons exposed to averageconcentrations of ozone of 1.5 ppm (range not indicated) for two hours(Griswold, Chambers, and Motley 1957/Ex. 1-128). Welders exposed to maximalozone concentrations of 9 ppm were observed to have pulmonary congestion(Kleinfeld and Giel 1956/Ex. 1-120).OSHA received a number of comments on the proposed PEL for ozone. The EdisonElectric Institute (EEI) (Ex. 133A, pp. 22-23) stated that the studiesby Bils (1970/Ex. 1-58), Jaffe (1967/Ex. 1-101), and Griswold et al. (1957/Ex.1-128), cited above, do not provide substantial evidence for the proposedPEL. With regard to Bils' (1970/Ex. 1-58) finding of damaged alveolar tissuein mice exposed to a 1-ppm concentration of ozone for one or two days,EEI notes that ``OSHA does not explain how these data can be translatedto humans in the workplace'' (Ex. 133A, p. 22). In addition, EEI is concernedthat ``OSHA neither critically evaluates . . . nor explains why the changesin lung function reported by [the Jaffe (1967/Ex. 1-101)] study representa significant risk . . . ,'' and OSHA has not presented a substitute fora STEL of 0.3 ppm. Finally, EEI questions the relevance of the study byGriswold et al. (1957/Ex. 1-128) to the formulation of the proposed PEL(Ex. 133A, p. 23). The Agency believes that these three studies point tothe short-term effect (i.e., less than eight hours) of ozone exposure;the Bils (1970/Ex. 1-58) data demonstrate that the lung is the target organ;the Jaffe (1967/Ex. 1-101) data point to an effect level of 0.5 ppm andshow that a STEL of 0.3 ppm will afford protection; and the Griswold etal. (1957/Ex. 1-128) data provide further evidence of reduced lung functionas a result of short-term, acute exposure, rather than chronic exposure.In addition, EEI commented that ``OSHA's health assessment and feasibilityanalysis with respect to the facilities of the electric utility industryare deficient. Thus, EEI recommends that OSHA consider explaining thatits ozone proposal does not apply to that industry'' (Ex. 133A, p. 22).This same concern was reflected in the submission of the second commenter,Gulf Power Company (Ex. 3-938, p. 3). In response to these comments, OSHAemphasizes that the standards established in this rulemaking are basedon the evidence of adverse health effects associated with exposure to toxicsubstances in the workplace. These effects would be the same, regardlessof industry sector, if the exposure levels were the same. If, as EEI andGulf Power Company contend, ozone exposures in power plants pose no significantrisk to workers' health because they are controlled at or below the permissibleexposure limits being promulgated in this rulemaking, then the electricutility industry is already in compliance and will not be impacted by thenew PELs. The Agency has determined that the scientific evidence establishesthe need for a short-term limit to substantially reduce the significantrisk of pulmonary dysfunction that exists as a result of acute or chronicintermittent exposure to ozone.The Gulf Power Company also expressed its belief that the 0.3-ppm short-termlimit proposed by OSHA is unsubstantiated:<ITAG tagnum="21">Exposing someone to 1 ppm of ozone for 15 minutes may be just as valida ceiling limit as 0.3 ppm. . . . We think that it is arbitrary to selecta value of 0.3 ppm without further study (Ex. 3-938, pp. 3-4; see alsoEx. 3-1144).</ITAG>The Agency notes, again, that an effect level of 0.5 ppm is demonstratedby the Jaffe (1967/Ex. 1-101) data. Further justification for a STEL of0.3 ppm is found in Proctor, Hughes, and Fischman <T3>(Chemical Hazards of the Workplace, </T3>2nd ed., 1988), who reportthat, ``except for one report, the threshold for effects in humans appearsto be between 0.2 and 0.4 ppm'' (Menzel 1984, and cited in Proctor, Hughes,and Fischman 1988, p. 388). The selection of 0.3 ppm as a short-term limitwas neither invalid nor arbitrary, but rather, was based on the best availablescientific evidence.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N2) believes that ozone's toxicity requires an evenmore stringent limit. According to NIOSH, ``Ozone is a chemical capableof inducing serious adverse health effects at low exposure concentrations,tenths of a part per million. . . .'' The AFL-CIO (Ex. 194) agrees withNIOSH's assessment. OSHA agrees that ozone's health effects require a protectivelimit, and it is for this reason that the final rule promulgates TWA andSTEL limits for ozone.In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA limit of 0.1 ppm andestablishing a 15-minute STEL of 0.3 ppm for ozone based on observationsthat significant declines in pulmonary function can result from repeatedintermittent exposures or even from a single short-term exposure (Bils1970/Ex. 1-58; Jaffe 1967/Ex. 1-101; Griswold, Chambers and Motley 1957/Ex.1-128). OSHA believes that, in the absence of a STEL, employees will continueto be at significant risk of material impairment in pulmonary functionalcapacity associated with short-term exposures that could occur if exposuresare controlled only by an 8-hour TWA. Thus the Agency concludes that itis necessary to supplement the former PEL with a STEL of 0.3 ppm to substantiallyreduce this risk.<ITAG tagnum="71">PARAQUAT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 4685-14-7; Chemical Formula:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 12303</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for paraquat was 0.5 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA, with askin notation. The ACGIH has established a limit of 0.1 mg/m3 as an 8-hourTWA. The Agency proposed, and the final rule establishes, a permissibleexposure limit of 0.1 mg/m3 TWA for this substance; the skin notation isretained. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs. Paraquat refers to a groupof compounds that are odorless, yellow solids. The principal compoundsare: 1,1andmin172;-dimethyl-4,4andmin172;-bipyridinium; 1,1andmin172;-dimethyl-4,4andmin172;-bipyridiniumbis (methyl sulfate); and 1,1andmin172;-dimethyl-.4,4andmin172;-bipyridiniumdichloride.The Toxicity of these compounds depends on the compound's cationic moiety.Acute oral toxicity is reported as 30 mg/kg ion as cation for guinea pigsand 127 mg/kg ion for female rats, while the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 240 mg/kg ion (Clark 1964, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 456; Clark, McElligott, and Hurst 1966/Ex. 1-503; McElligott1965, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 456). Paraquat can penetrate brokenskin after it has broken down the skin's usual barriers (Swan 1969/Ex.1-576; Clark, McElligott, and Hurst 1966/Ex. 1-503). By inhalation or intratrachealinjection, paraquat is very toxic because of its irritant properties (Gage1968/Ex. 1-508). Rats exposed once for six hours to a concentration of1 mg/m3 died if the aerosol contained particles with diameters of 3 to5 microns (Gage 1968/Ex. 1-508). Rats exposed six hours/day for three weeksto the same aerosol at 0.4 mg/m3 exhibited signs of pulmonary irritation;no effects were observed for the same exposure regimen at 0.1 mg/m3 (Gage1968/Ex. 1-508).When the diameter of the particles in the aerosol are not of respirablesize, toxicity is greatly reduced. The 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> for rats is 6400 mg/kg, and dogs, rats, and guinea pigs toleratedthree weeks of daily exposures to 100 mg/m3 without apparent pulmonaryeffect (although nosebleeds were observed) (Palazzolo 1965, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 456).Dietary administration, for 90 days, of doses ranging from 300 to 700 ppmshowed dose-related effects ranging from pulmonary edema to intraalveolarhemorrhage and death (Kimbrough and Gaines 1970/Ex. 1-560).Paraquat's teratogenic potency in mice is low (Bus and Gibson 1975/Ex.1-539), although 100 ppm administered in the drinking water of pregnantrats increased postnatal mortality significantly (Bus and Gibson 1975/Ex.1-539).In humans, 69 accidental deaths and 81 suicides were attributed to theeffects of paraquat exposure up to 1972 (Chipman Chemicals 1972, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 456). Bouletreau, Ducluzeau, Bui-Xuan et al.(1977/Ex. 1-538) reported 31 cases of renal insufficiency, and a sprayapplicator was killed when he absorbed a lethal dose of inadequately dilutedparaquat through the skin (Jaros 1978/Ex. 1-513). Workers using a 0.05-to 1-percent solution of paraquat developed skin and mucous membrane irritationbut experienced no symptoms of systemic poisoning (Howard 1978/Ex. 1-512).Fugita, Suzuki, and Ochiai (1976, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 456)reported five cases of reversible kerato-conjunctivitis, with corneal injury,after one month of exposure to paraquat. Only NIOSH commented on paraquat.OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.1 mg/m3 for paraquat, witha skin notation. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workersfrom the significant risk of skin, eye, and pulmonary irritation observedin animals exposed to aerosols of respirable size at levels below OSHA'sformer PEL for paraquat. The Agency considers the irritant effects of paraquatto be material impairments of health. OSHA is retaining the skin notationfor this substance because of its capacity to penetrate the skin. <ITAG tagnum="71">SILICA, CRYSTALLINE_CRISTOBALITE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 14464-46-1; Chemical Formula: SiO<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1354</ITAG>The former OSHA PEL for respirable cristobalite was one-half the valuecalculated from the mass formula for quartz, measured as respirable dust.This limit corresponds to a range of 0.04 to 0.05 mg/m3, measured as silica,for dusts containing 10 to 100 percent quartz. The ACGIH recommends an8-hour TWA limit of 0.05 mg/m3, measured as respirable silica dust. Althoughexpressed differently, the current ACGIH and former OSHA limit for cristobaliteare comparable. The ACGIH's mg/m3 limit, adopted in 1985, does not reflecta re-evaluation of cristobalite's toxicity but was adopted merely to simplifythe monitoring of cristobalite dust concentrations. The ACGIH limit isbased on a study by Gardner (1938, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 522)that was confirmed by King, Mohanty, Harrison, and Nagelschmidt (1953/Ex.1-85). Experimental animals injected with cristobalite showed a more severeresponse than that produced by quartz, and the fibrosis that followed wasdiffuse rather than nondular. OSHA proposed, and the final rule establishes,a permissible exposure limit of 0.05 mg/m3 TWA for cristobalite, measuredas respirable silica dust. Cristobalite, one of the three major forms ofsilicon dioxide, is transparant, tasteless, and stable at high temperatures.The final rule replaces OSHA's former limit for cristobalite, which isexpressed, as described above, with a numerically equivalent limit of 0.05mg/m3; the Agency is establishing this time-weighted average limit to simplifyemployee exposure monitoring. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A; Tr. pp. 3-96to 3-97) concurred with the selection of this limit but recommended thatcristobalite be designated as a potential human carcinogen. OSHA's discussionof this and other rulemaking issues appears in the following entry describingthe record evidence on quartz dust. <ITAG tagnum="71">SILICA, CRYSTALLINE_QUARTZ</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 14808-60-7; Chemical Formula: None</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1355</ITAG>The former OSHA limit for silica-containing dusts is a respirable dustlimit expressed as the following formula: <ITAG tagnum="26">(10 mg/m3)/(% respirable quartz+2).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">At one time, the ACGIH also expressed its silica limit in terms ofthis formula. However, the current ACGIH TLV is 0.1 mg/m3, measured asrespirable quartz dust. OSHA proposed, and the final rule establishes,a permissible exposure limit of 0.1 mg/m3 TWA, as respirable quartz. Quartzis a colorless, odorless, noncombustible solid. The ACGIH does not see this change in the value of its limit for occupationalexposure to silica as significant; instead, the ACGIH made this changeto conform its limit for this dust to its TLVs for other dusts. If theformer OSHA formula is used to calculate a limit for a dust containing100 percent quartz, the limit would be 0.098 mg/m3, a value that is notappreciably different from the ACGIH`s revised limit of 0.1 mg/m3 for respirablequartz dust. For quartz dusts containing less than 100 percent free silica,the former OSHA formula would yield a limit of, for example, 0.83 mg/m3for respirable dust containing 10 percent quartz. This result is somewhatmore stringent than the ACGIH's TLV of 0.1 mg/m3. For cristobalite andtridymite, the former OSHA formula and the ACGIH limits yield approximatelythe same results: both are approximately one-half the limit establishedby these two entities for quartz dust (see the discussions below). Occupational exposure to free silica has been known for many years to producesilicosis, a chronic, disabling lung disease characterized by the formationof silica-containing nodules of scar tissue in the lungs. Simple silicosis,in which the nodules are less than 1 cm in diamater (as measured on chestX-ray films) is generally asymptomatic but can be slowly progessive, evenin the absence of continued exposure. Complicated silicosis (i.e., withnodules greater than 1 cm in diameter) is more often associated with disabilityand can also progress in the absence of continuing exposure. The health basis underlying the ACGIH's limit for crystalline silica isthe work of Russell et al. (1929/Ex. 1-156), which suggested that a limitof 10 mppcf would protect workers from the effects of exposure to granitedust; a study by Ayer (1969/Ex. 1-129) demonstrated that 10 mppcf of granitedust is approximately equal to 0.1 mg/m3 of respirable quartz dust (ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3).NIOSH has recommended an exposure limit of 0.05 mg/m3 as respirable freesilica for all crystalline forms of silica. As applied to cristobaliteand tridymite, the NIOSH REL is 0.05 mg/m3, the same as the ACGIH TLV,but NIOSH's 0.05-mg/m3 REL for quartz dust is one-half the value of theACGIH TLV for quartz dust. To support its more stringent REL for quartzdust, NIOSH cites the work of Hosey, Ashe, and Trasko (1957, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 524), which reported that no new cases of silicosisoccurred in workers in Vermont granite sheds who were generally exposedto 0.05 mg/m3 or less of granite dust. The recommendation was also partlybased on studies by Theriault, Burgess, DiBerardinis et al. (1974/Ex. 1-94a);Theriault, Peters, and Fine (1974/Ex. 1-110); and Theriault, Peters, andJohnson (1974/Ex. 1-94b), which found that annual declines in pulmonaryfunction and abnormal chest X-rays occurred among 192 granite shed workersexposed to an average quartz concentration of 0.05 mg/m3. NIOSH noted thatthe exposure estimates reported in the Theriault et al. (1974/Exs. 1-94a,1-94b, and 1-110) studies failed to account for the higher exposures thatprobably occurred in the years before exposure sampling was initiated and,therefore, that the Theriault et al. (1974) exposure data may have understatedaverage exposures to quartz. Thus, NIOSH believes that the exposures responsiblefor the declines in pulmonary function were actually above 0.05 mg/m3.The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) found NIOSH's reasoning unpersuasive, citing areport by Graham, O'Grady, and Dubuc (1981/Ex. 1-172), who measured thepulmonary function of the same group of workers studied by Theriault etal. (1974/Exs. 1-94a, 1-94b, and 1-110), and found, in contrast to Theriault,that these workers experienced ``an overall increase in FVC and FEV'' (ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3).Although OSHA did not propose a significant change in the exposure limit,there were several comments that focused on two issues: (1) the adequacyof the proposed 0.1 mg/m3 respirable quartz limit in reducing the riskof silicosis; and (2) recent evidence describing the potential carcinogenicityof silica dust. With regard to the first issue, Dr. Philip Landrigan of the Mount SinaiSchool of Medicine, representing the American Public Health Association,testified as follows at the informal hearing:<ITAG tagnum="21">Numerous epidemiologic studies have been undertaken in this century,which have established a dose-response relationship between occupationalexposure to silica dust and the development of silicosis. These studieshave shown clearly that there is a positive dose-response relationshipbetween chronic silica exposure and the development of silicosis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The most recent of these reviews which have examined that relationshipis presented in the 1986 NIOSH text on occupational respiratory diseases,a most authoritative book in the field, widely read by medical scientistsin this country and abroad. The data which was summarized in that chapterindicate quite clearly that the dose-response relationship between silicaexposure and silicosis is present in people with lifetime exposure to silicabelow the current . . . standard of 100 micrograms per cubic meter. Indeed,the data suggests that the dose-response relationship extends downwardeven to levels of exposure below the current NIOSH recommended standardof 50 micrograms per cubic meter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">And against the authoritative NIOSH review . . . OSHA has cited oneshort three-page article . . . [Graham et al. 1981/Ex. 1-172] to indicatethat the dose-response relationship between silica and silicosis does notextend downward to below 100 micrograms per cubic meter (Tr. pp. 3-277to 3-278).</ITAG>Several commenters (Exs. 3-678, 3-733, 130, 138, 139, 147, 161, and 126)disagreed with Dr. Landrigan's assessment. For example, Frederick A. Renningerof the National Stone Association (Ex. 139) cited Dr. John Peters, theauthor of the chapter in the NIOSH reference referred to by Dr. Landrigan.In his chapter, Dr. Peters concluded as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">All of the studies described in this section provide evidence foradverse pulmonary effects at levels of exposure above 10 mppcf or 0.1 mg/m\3\.Some showed that foundry workers exposed to the equivalent of 0.05 mg/m\3\of quartz developed silicosis while those with less exposure did not. .. . All the Vermont findings were seen with an average exposure of around0.05 mg/m\3\ of quartz. It is possible, however, that since this was theaverage exposure, individuals whose exposure exceeded this level accountedfor the noted effects. (The ``no effect'' level was probably below 0.05mg/m\3\, but the available data did not allow accurate determinations.)(Peters, J.M., ``Silicosis.'' In: <T3>Occupational Respiratory Diseases, </T3>p. 229, J.S. Merchant, ed.DHHS (NIOSH) Pub. No. 86-102, NIOSH 1986b).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Mr. Renninger also points to the difficulty in equating impinger samplingresults, which were used in the Vermont granite shed studies, to gravimetric(mg/m\3\) measures of respirable dust. He cited Dr. Peters as reportingthat ``gravimetric and impinger sampling are known to be poorly correlated''(Ex. 139, p. 5). Mr. Renninger also pointed out that the conversion betweenmppcf and mg/m\3\ measurements for silica will vary with the industry,thus adding another level of uncertainty in interpreting the health data.OSHA's decision to propose a 0.1-mg/m\3\ PEL for respirable silica dust,rather than the NIOSH REL of 0.05 mg/m\3\, was partly based on the reportby Dr. William Graham et al. (Graham, O'Grady, and Dubuc 1981/Ex. 1-172)discussed above. In a posthearing submission, Dr. Graham discussed thefindings of Theriault and co-workers (1974/Exs. 1-94a, 1-94b, and 1-110),which heavily influenced the decision by NIOSH to issue a REL of 0.05 mg/m\3\(Ex. 147). Dr. Graham discussed three limitations of the Theriault et al.(1974) studies. First, the X-ray films were interpreted by a single readerwho was neither certified nor a chest physician; Dr. Peters points outthat it is generally accepted that X-ray films must be read by three experiencedreaders. Second, there was no attempt to study workers hired after 1938and exposed to low dust levels separately from workers exposed to higherdust levels prior to 1938. Third, there was a group of workers who werejudged to have abnormal X-ray findings despite a reported lack of exposureto dust, which raises the question about the accuracy of interpretations.Dr. Graham also interpreted his own findings of granite shed workers asshowing that the loss in pulmonary function predicted to occur among theseworkers by Theriault et al. (1974/Exs. 1-94a, 1-94b, and 1-110) had, infact, not occurred. One explanation offered by Dr. Graham is the possibilitythat technical difficulties arose during the Theriault et al. (1974) studiesin the administration of spirometric tests, and may have resulted in spuriouslylow values for pulmonary function. Dr. Graham discussed a continuationof his own work in which he has found neither pulmonary function lossesnor high prevalences of abnormal chest X-rays among granite shed workerswho were employed after 1938-1940, when lower dust levels prevailed (Ex.147, pp. 8-9). However, the analysis of quartz content in the dust samplescollected has not yet been completed (Ex. 147, p. 8).In addition to the evidence on the dose-response relationship for silicosis,rulemaking participants discussed at length recent data suggesting thatsilica may be carcinogenic (Exs. 147, 161, 194, 138, 3-1159, 3-1060, and139; Tr. p. 3-94, Tr. p. 7-80, Tr. p. 11-104). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B)believes that the data on silica are such that the Agency should considera separate 6(b) rulemaking for this substance. Dr. Frank Mirer, Directorof the Health and Safety Department of the United Auto Workers, summarizedthe evidence on silica's potential carcinogenicity at the hearing:<ITAG tagnum="21">The most prominent study [on the health effects of silica exposureis] by Holland and coworkers * * * [it] provided really clear evidencethat silica was carcinogenic in rats by inhalation. Non-malignant pulmonaryeffects were also observed. There is a considerable line of other workin rats and hamsters, in the development of both lung tumors and lymphatictumors from exposure to silica.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In epidemiology, there's ample evidence that crystalline silica iscarcinogenic and that it is hazardous at levels below the proposed PEL.The IARC monograph reviewed the data available in 1986 and described aconsiderable body of evidence. Despite the methodological limitations pointedout by IARC, the sheer number and consistency of the findings is most persuasive(Tr. pp. 7-80 to 7-81).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Studies [exist] of workers in a variety of industries where high exposureof silica-containing dusts have revealed high lung cancer risks. Theseresults include ten positive studies among mine workers, four in ceramicsand glass industries, [and] four in the foundry industry. We also bringto your attention at least four additional studies published since theIARC criteria document was completed. These, in particular, we think createan iron-clad case for the problems presented by this material (Tr. pp.7-80 to 7-81).</ITAG>In a posthearing submission by the Refractories Institute, Dr. John Craigheadof the University of Vermont reviewed the human and animal data and concludedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">I find the experimental evidence in animals, suggesting a possiblerole of silica in the pathogenesis of bronchogenic carcinomas, to be faultyand incomplete. I also conclude that the epidemiological studies in humansprovide inadequate evidence to conclude that man is at increased risk ofdeveloping carcinoma of the lung as a result of silica dust exposure. Mycomments in no way exclude from consideration silica as a cause of bronchogeniccarcinoma, but only point out the inadequacies of the scientific informationand emphasize the need for additional, carefully designed systematic studies(Ex. 161A, p. 5)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In similar attachments to the Refractories Institute's submission,Dr. Marvin Kushner, Professor of Pathology at the State University of NewYork at Stony Brook, pointed to the lack of similarity between the pulmonarylesions found in exposed rats and silicosis lesions in humans; he suggestedthat the carcinomas seen in rats may be due to a ``non-specific'' effectthat is not a direct result of silica inducing malignant transformation(Ex. 161C). Dr. Carl Shy, Professor of Epidemiology at the University ofNorth Carolina, reviewed the epidemiological evidence and concluded that``the role of occupational silica exposure in causing lung cancer remainsundetermined'' (Ex. 161D, p. 8).OSHA believes that the issues raised above deserve a careful and thoroughscientific evaluation of the literature. The evidence that silica may presenta carcinogenic hazard has been developing over the past few years and iscontinuing to receive considerable attention by investigators. OSHA willcontinue to monitor with great interest emerging developments in this area.At this time, however, OSHA believes that the record evidence leaves manyquestions unanswered regarding the need to reduce the PEL for silica. Therefore,in the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.1 mg/m\3\for quartz, measured as the respirable silica fraction. This limit representsno substantial change from OSHA's former formula limit, but will simplifysampling procedures, as indicated in the NPRM.<ITAG tagnum="71">SILICA, CRYSTALLINE_TRIDYMITE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 15468-32-3; Chemical Formula: SiO<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1356</ITAG>The former OSHA PEL for respirable tridymite was expressed as one-halfthe value of the mass formula for quartz dust. This formula correspondsto a range of 0.04 to 0.05 mg/m\3\, measured as silica, for dusts containing10 to 100 percent tridymite. The Agency proposed, and the final rule establishes,a PEL of 0.05 mg/m\3\ TWA for tridymite. The ACGIH recommends an 8-hourTWA limit of 0.05 mg/m\3\, measured as silica dust. The ACGIH limit isbased on a study conducted by King, Mohanty, Harrison, and Nagelschmidt(1953/Ex. 1-85) that found tridymite to be the most active of the freesilica forms when injected intratracheally into rats. Tridymite is a transparent,tasteless form of free silica. Although expressed in different units, the current ACGIH and former OSHAlimits for tridymite are comparable. The ACGIH's mg/m\3\ limit, adoptedin 1985, does not reflect a re-evaluation of tridymite's toxicity but wasadopted merely to simplify the monitoring of tridymite dust concentrations.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A) concurs with the selection of this limit butrecommends that tridymite be designated as a potential occupational carcinogen.No other comments were received on tridymite. OSHA is replacing its former limit for tridymite, which is described above,with a numerically equivalent limit of 0.05 mg/m\3\, measured as respirablesilica dust; the final rule establishes this change to simplify employeeexposure monitoring.<ITAG tagnum="71">SILICA, CRYSTALLINE_TRIPOLI</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1317-95-9; Chemical Formula: SiO<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Although OSHA`sTable Z-2 did not specifically indicate a limit for tripoli, OSHA formerlyspecified a limit for crystalline quartz based on the formula measuredas total respirable dust: 10 mg/m\3\/%SiO<T2>2</T2>+2. Expressed as mg/m\3\, this limit corresponds to a limit inthe range of 0.08 to 0.1 mg/m\3\ for respirable dust containing from 10to 100 percent silica. The 8-hour TWA ACGIH limit for tripoli is 0.1 mg/m\3\,measured as respirable silica dust. This limit was adopted by the ACGIHin 1985 to simplify the monitoring of quartz dust concentrations. Thus,this revision does not represent a re-evaluation of toxicity data for tripoli.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B) does not concur with the final rule's limitand recommends a separate 6(b) rulemaking for tripoli, which NIOSH considersa potential occupational carcinogen. (see section above on CrystallineQuartz for OSHA's discussion of the record evidence on the carcinogenicityof silica). No other comments were received on tripoli. OSHA is replacing its limit for quartz, which is expressed as the formulapresented above, with a numerically equivalent limit of 0.1 mg/m\3\ TWAas respirable silica dust; the final rule establishes this limit for tripoli.<ITAG tagnum="71">SILICA, FUSED </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 60676-86-0; Chemical Formula: SiO<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

No. 1363A (respirable dust)</ITAG>OSHA`s former exposure limit for soapstone, total dust, was 20 mppcf (6mg/m\3\), and the Agency had no separate limit for the respirable fraction.The ACGIH has established individual TLV-TWAs for these two forms of soapstone:6 mg/m\3\ for total dust, and 3 mg/m\3\ for the respirable fraction, bothmeasured as total dust or respirable dust containing less then 1 percentquartz. Because the ratio of total dust mass to the mass of the respirablefraction is 2:1 (ACGIH 1984, p. 480), the 6-mg/m\3\ total dust limit automaticallyimplies a 3-mg/m\3\ limit for the respirable fraction. OSHA proposed, andthe final rule establishes, permissible exposure limits of 6 mg/m\3\ TWA(total dust) and 3 mg/m\3\ TWA (respirable dust) for soapstone. NIOSH (Ex.8-47, Table N1) concurred with this determination. A study by Dreessen and DallaValle (1935/Ex. 1-588) of mill workers exposedto soapstone showed lung changes in these workers, but it is believed thatthe dusts involved in these exposures were actually steatite talc, whichhad a tremolite content of 10 percent. Experiments by Miller and Sayers(1941/Ex. 1-595) showed no measurable toxic effects in guinea pigs injectedintraperitoneally with various samples of soapstone. No comments were receivedon soapstone other than those submitted by NIOSH. The final rule expresses the limit for soapstone as total dust in mg/m\3\,rather than mppcf, to simplify employee sampling and analysis. The totaldust limit being established, 6 mg/m\3\, is equivalent to the previsiouslimit of 20 mppcf, and the new limit of 3 mg/m\3\ for respirable dust isactually implicit in the total dust limit.<ITAG tagnum="71">SULFUR DIOXIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7446-09-5; Chemical formula: SO<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1375</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for sulfur dioxide (SO<T2>2</T2>) was 5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. The Agency proposed to revise thislimit to 2 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and to supplement this limit with a 15-minuteSTEL of 5 ppm. Although NIOSH recommends a limit of 0.5 ppm for sulfurdioxide, NIOSH did concur (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) with the proposed limits.The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 2 ppm and a TLV-STEL of 5 ppm. In the finalrule, OSHA is establishing a 2-ppm 8-hour TWA and a 5-ppm 15-minute STELfor SO<T2>2</T2>. Sulfur dioxide is a colorless, nonflammable gas or liquid witha suffocating odor.OSHA has studied the effects of occupational exposure to SO<T2>2</T2> for several years. The Agency's 5-ppm limit for this substancewas established in 1971 on the basis of the 1968 ACGIH TLV-TWA. In 1975,OSHA proposed to revise this limit downward to 2 ppm and held public hearingsto gather information on industrial exposures to SO<T2>2</T2>. In response to shifting priorities within the Agency, OSHAdid not promulgate a final standard at that time. The following discussionsummarizes the record evidence relevant to SO<T2>2</T2> both from the earlier (1975-1976) record and from the recordof the present rulemaking.Workplace exposure to sulfur dioxide causes both acute and chronic effects.The chronic effects of exposure include permanent pulmonary impairment,which is caused by repeated episodes of bronchoconstriction. A number ofhuman and animal studies demonstrate this effect (Skalpe 1964/Ex. 1-438;Smith, Peters, Reading, and Castle 1977/Ex. 1-805; Archer and Gillam 1978/Ex.1-711; Ministry of Health (Canada) 1976/Ex. 1-1208; Lewis, Campbell, andVaughan 1969, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 542).Kehoe, Machle, Kitzmiller, and LeBlanc (1932/Ex. 1-339) studied two groupsof male refrigeration workers with long-term (average of four years) exposuresto average SO<T2>2</T2> concentrations of 20 to 30 ppm, with a range of exposures from10 to 70 ppm. These workers were believed to have been exposed prior to1927 to SO<T2>2</T2> levels considerably higher and averaging from 80 to 100 ppm.This study showed that SO<T2>2</T2> exposure caused an increased incidence of nasopharyngitis, shortnessof breath on exertion (dyspnea), and chronic fatigue (Kehoe, Machle, Kitzmiller,and LeBlanc 1932/Ex. 1-339).In a study of Norwegian paperpulp mill workers, Skalpe (1964/Ex. 1-438)reported that average SO<T2>2</T2> concentrations were believed to range from 2 to 36 ppm. Resultsshowed a significantly higher frequency of respiratory disease symptoms,including coughing, expectoration, and dyspnea, among workers less than50 years of age (i.e., those with the shortest exposure). Workers olderthan 50, however, did not display symptomatology different from that ofcontrols.More recently, Smith, Peters, Reading, and Castle (1977/Ex. 1-805) studieda group of smelter workers exposed, on average, to less than 2 ppm SO<T2>2</T2> but concurrently exposed to respirable particulate at levelsgenerally less than 2 mg/m3. These workers showed a decrement in forcedvital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume (FEV<T2>l</T2>) of 4.8 percent when compared with controls. These authors concludedthat workers exposed to SO<T2>2</T2> levels above 1 ppm had an accelerated loss of pulmonary function.This study has been criticized on the grounds that the control populationitself may have been exposed to respiratory toxins and that other contaminants,such as iron sulfites, may have contributed to the pulmonary decrementseen in these smelter workers. On average, 60 percent more of the workersexposed to greater than 1 ppm SO<T2>2</T2> reported symptoms of chronic cough than did workers who wereexposed to SO<T2>2</T2> at a concentration below 1 ppm. The prevalence of chronic sputumproduction was elevated for workers who had never smoked and who were exposedabove 1 ppm.Archer and Gillam (1978/Ex. 1-711) studied workers at the same smelterfacility and obtained results similar to those of Smith, Peters, Reading,and Castle (1977/Ex. 1-805). Significant reductions in FVC and FEV<T2>1</T2> were found to be associated with chronic exposures to 0.4 to3 ppm SO<T2>2</T2> (TWA) with concomitant exposure to particulate. These authorsalso found a corresponding increase in some symptoms of respiratory disease(chronic bronchitis) that was not attributable to smoking. Tomono and coworkers(1961, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 542) found that 1.6 ppm was thelowest concentration that produced bronchoconstriction in 46 healthy malesubjects.OSHA's June 7, 1988 proposal also discussed the basis for NIOSH's recommendationof a 0.5-ppm 8-hour TWA limit for SO<T2>2</T2>. In addition to the studies by Archer and Gillam (1977/Ex. 1-711)and Smith, Peters, Reading, and Castle (1977/Ex. 1-805) described above,NIOSH relied on a third study (Ministry of Health (Canada) 1976/Ex. 1-1208)of smelter workers exposed to SO<T2>2</T2> levels of 2.5 ppm for 10 or more years, which showed an increasedincidence of respiratory disease in these workers. A fourth study citedby NIOSH (NIOSH 1977m, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 542) reportedthat 10,000 workers exposed to SO<T2>2</T2> at levels of 0.35 ppm showed no adverse exposure-related effects.Alarie and co-workers (1970 and 1972, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.542) found that guinea pigs exposed to SO<T2>2</T2> by inhalation showed no decrement in pulmonary function at SO<T2>2</T2> levels of 5 ppm; monkeys exposed to 1.3 ppm for 78 weeks alsoshowed no deficit (Alarie, Ulrich, Busey et al. 1970 and 1972, both ascited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 542). However, in another study, dogs exposedcontinuously to 5 ppm for 225 days showed increased pulmonary flow resistanceand a decrease in lung compliance (Lewis, Campbell, and Vaughan 1969, ascited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 542). In addition, rats exposed to 10 ppmSO<T2>2</T2> daily for six weeks developed a thickening of the mucous layerthat interfered with effective particle clearance (Dalhamn 1956, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 542).The acute effects of SO<T2>2</T2> exposure have been recognized for years in industrial settings;symptoms of acute overexposure include upper respiratory tract irritation,rhinorrhea, choking, and coughing. These symptoms are so disagreeable thatmost persons will not tolerate exposure for longer than 15 minutes. Within5 to 15 minutes of the onset of exposure, workers develop temporary reflexbroncho-constriction and increased airway resistance. Short-term exposurecauses measurable bronchoconstriction (Frank, Amdur, Worcester, and Whittenburger1962, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 542; Weir, Stevens, and Bromberg1972/Ex. 1-401); the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 542) reports that this bronchoconstrictionis dose-related and is manifested as an increase in pulmonary flow resistance.Efforts have been made to quantify the acute no-adverse-effect level forSO<T2>2</T2>-induced increased airway resistance. Frank, Amdur, Worcester,and Whittenberger (1962, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 542) reportedthat, at SO<T2>2</T2> concentrations of 1 ppm, one in 11 healthy subjects developedpulmonary flow resistance; at concentrations of 5 or 13 ppm, there wasa 39- and 72-percent increase, respectively, in such resistance. Weir,Stevens, and Bromberg (1972/Ex. 1-401) noted a statistically significantbut reversible increase in small-airway resistance and a decrease in lungcompliance at a concentration of 3 ppm; however, Burton et al. (1969) reportedno effects, even among smokers, at a level of 2.1 ppm.N.R. Frank, Professor of Medicine at the University of Washington State,commented during the 1977 hearing (NIOSH 1977m) that sulfur dioxide maynot by itself be hazardous to the lungs but that an aerosol of sulfur dioxideand water or SO<T2>2</T2> oxidized to sulfate particulate may increase the toxic potentialof SO<T2>2</T2> (Ex. 40, Docket H-039). Dr. Frank also presented evidence showingthat a single short-term exposure to very high SO<T2>2</T2> levels (200 to 1000 ppm) can produce lung damage (Ex. 40, DocketH-039).In the current generic rulemaking, participants such as the American Ironand Steel Institute (AISI) (Exs. 3-1123 and 188) and the Corn RefinersAssociation (Exs. 8-65 and 177) raised issues similar to those raised duringOSHA's 1977 rulemaking on SO<T2>2</T2>. These included:andbullet; Lack of evidence that long-term exposure to SO<T2>2</T2> causes chronic respiratory disease; andandbullet; The potentiation of SO<T2>2</T2>'s adverse effects by the formation of sulfates or higher sulfuroxides from interactions between SO<T2>2</T2> and water or SO<T2>2</T2> and particulate matter.Regarding the first point, the Corn Refiners Association (CRA) referredOSHA to studies and testimony on the effects of SO<T2>2</T2> exposure on employees in corn wet-milling from the earlier rulemaking(Ex. 66, Docket H-039). The CRA reported that the chronic respiratory diseaseand pulmonary impairment seen in SO<T2>2</T2>-exposed smelter workers did not occur in corn milling plantemployees (Ex. 66-1, Docket H-039). The CRA sponsored a study performedby Drs. Ferris and Essex from the Harvard School of Public Health (Ex.66-3, Docket H-039). Fifty corn wet-milling workers involved in the early,SO<T2>2</T2>-using stage of the wet-milling process were studied. Exposures(8-hour TWAs) in this group ranged from 0.5 to more than 5 ppm SO<T2>2</T2>, particulates ranged from 0.0 to 0.17 mg/m3, and water-solublesulfates ranged from 0.0 to 40.0 mg/m3. Results of this study showed that,at levels of about 3 ppm SO<T2>2</T2>, acute symptoms such as coughing developed, but chronic, irreversiblesymptoms were not seen at exposure levels below 5 ppm (Ex. 66-1, DocketH-039). These authors concluded:<ITAG tagnum="21">Taken as a whole, the results suggest that no <T3>significant chronic </T3>respiratory impairments occurred at exposurelevels under 5 ppm. The lack of association between the most serious symptomsof respiratory disease and exposure levels below 5 ppm also suggests thatthe atmosphere in question is quite distinct from that found in the <T3>copper smelter studies </T3>(Ex. 66-3, Docket H-039).</ITAG>In addition, the studies by Smith, Peters, Reading, and Castle (1977/Ex.1-373) and Archer and Gillam (1978/Ex. 1-711) were criticized in OSHA'searlier rulemaking for not taking into consideration the impact on thestudied workers' health of the higher SO<T2>2</T2> levels to which these employees had been exposed in prior years.Arthur D. Little, Inc. (Ex. 95, Docket H-044) also criticized these studies,noting that their observation periods were too short to derive reliabledata on chronic effects.These criticisms and the lack of chronic effects observed in animals atlevels below 5 ppm (Alarie, Ulrich, Busey et al. 1970 and 1972, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 542) caused commenters to question whether chroniclung disease results from long-term exposure to SO<T2>2</T2> below the current 5-ppm PEL. Dr. Alarie appeared at the 1977hearing and testified on animal studies conducted by him and others onsulfur dioxide (NIOSH 1977m, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 542). Hetestified that, in his opinion, the long-term studies in animals supportthe establishment of a ceiling value for SO<T2>2</T2> but do not indicate that benefits would be gained by reducingthe time-weighted average from 5 to 2 ppm. OSHA agrees with Dr. Alariethat a STEL is necessary to minimize high short-term exposures to SO<T2>2</T2>; however, OSHA does not agree that no effects have been seenin animals at levels at or below 5 ppm. For example, Lewis, Campbell, andVaughan (1969, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 542) showed that beaglesexposed to 5 ppm SO<T2>2</T2> exhibited decreased dynamic compliance and increased flow resistance.In addition, NIOSH (1974b/Ex. 1-235) has reported:<ITAG tagnum="21">[M]an is considered to be more sensitive than other mammals to theeffects of sulfur dioxide in ranges commonly employed experimentally .. . (Ex. 1-235).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">It is therefore not surprising that humans have also been shown todevelop respiratory effects, including bronchoconstriction, coughing, andsputum production, at levels below 5 ppm (Smith, Peters, Reading, and Castle1977/Ex. 1-805; Archer and Gillam 1978/Ex. 1-711; Frank, Amdur, Worcester,and Whittenburger 1962, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 542; Weir, Stevens,and Bromburg 1972/Ex. 1-401).Many rulemaking participants (Exs. 3-1123, 8-57, 86, 86A, 117, 177, and188) were of the opinion that the lack of chronic effects demonstratedthat exposure to SO<T2>2</T2> did not cause material impairment of health at levels below5 ppm. For example, the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) (Ex. 133) criticizedthe Ferris et al. (1967/Ex. 1-316) study as being too old to be relevant.According to the EEI, the finding that the control group in the Ferriset al. (1967/Ex. 1-316) study also had an elevated incidence of diseaseand that there was no statistically significant difference in the extentof the respiratory disease incidence between the controls and the SO<T2>2</T2>-exposed group invalidates this study's finding of a seriouspulmonary effect in the SO<T2>2</T2>-exposed workers. OSHA does not agree with this interpretationof the Ferris et al. (1967/Ex. 1-316) study. OSHA believes that a moreaccurate interpretation of the results of this study would be that bothgroups of workers were occupationally exposed to respiratory toxins; thisis a very likely occupational scenario because the SO<T2>2</T2>-exposed workers in this study were pulpmill workers, while thosein the control group worked in a papermill, an occupational environmentalso recognized as hazardous.Taken together, the evidence from all of the studies described in thissubsection clearly shows that exposure to SO<T2>2</T2> below 5 ppm does cause respiratory symptoms, including repeatedepisodes of bronchoconstriction. The studies by Smith, Peters, Reading,and Castle (1977/Ex. 1-373), Archer and Gillam (1978/Ex. 1-711), and Frank,Amdur, Worcester, and Whittenberger (1962, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 542) consistently demonstrate that persons exposed to concentrationsof SO<T2>2</T2> below 5 ppm have an accelerated loss of pulmonary function andexhibit adverse pulmonary symptoms.OSHA believes that these effects constitute material impairments of healthand are significant. In addition, OSHA does not agree that these studiesdemonstrate the absence of chronic effects at low SO<T2>2</T2> exposure levels; long-term exposure to SO<T2>2</T2> has produced pulmonary function changes in dogs, and daily exposuresof rats to 10 ppm (only twice the former PEL) for six weeks produced athickened mucous layer and reduced the effectiveness of particle clearancefrom the trachea (Dalhamn 1956, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 542).The second point raised by commenters concerned the formation of othertoxic and irritating products from the interaction between SO<T2>2</T2> and water or between SO<T2>2</T2> and particles. Some of the participants in the earlier rulemaking,such as Dr. Colucci of the Corn Refiners Association, testified that itwould be more protective to identify and limit exposure to each of theseby-products, rather than to regulate SO<T2>2</T2> alone. OSHA disagrees with this approach; since these productsare all formed from sulfur dioxide, limiting exposure to SO<T2>2</T2> will concurrently limit exposure to these SO<T2>2</T2> by-products. This approach is more straightforward and easierto implement than attempting to identify the myriad decay products thatmay be formed in different industrial settings. Furthermore, the studiesdiscussed above clearly establish a relationship between airborne SO<T2>2</T2> levels and adverse effects; no quantitative relationship onwhich to base a PEL has been established for the decay products of SO<T2>2</T2> reactions. Therefore, to reduce the significant risk of respiratorysymptoms among exposed workers, OSHA finds that limiting exposure to SO<T2>2</T2> will be effective.After considering all of the relevant evidence from both the 1977 and thepresent dockets, OSHA concludes that a TWA of 2 ppm and a STEL of 5 ppmare necessary to reduce the significant risk of adverse respiratory effectsthat have been demonstrated to occur in workers exposed to SO<T2>2</T2> above these levels. Accordingly, OSHA is establishing theselimits in the final rule. The Agency finds that the coughing, increasein sputum production, and bronchoconstriction observed in workers exposedto SO<T2>2</T2> at the levels permitted by the former limit constitute materialimpairments of health and functional capacity, and must be protected against.This discussion is also a final statement of reasons for the 1977 rulemaking.Some evidence has been submitted by the steel and nonferrous metal industriesthat the STEL cannot be regularly achieved with engineering and work-practicecontrols in specific operations in SIC 33. These involve furnace areasin nonferrous metal smelters, blast furnace operations, and the sulfurplant. There is no evidence to the contrary in the record.OSHA will, therefore, permit more flexibility in the use of respiratorsfor these operations. The burden of proof will not be on employers to demonstratethat compliance with engineering and work-practice controls are infeasiblein a compliance action for these operations in SIC 33 as related to meetingthe requirements of the STEL.There may be a few other operations in this category, and for the TWA,where the record is unclear for SIC 33. Based on an appropriate showingpursuant to the OSH Act, OSHA would favorably consider requests for variancesfor specific operations in Sector 33 on methods of compliance for the STELand for the TWA. Of course, all requests for variances or any matters willbe considered based on their merits.  <ITAG tagnum="71">SULFUR TETRAFLUORIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7783-60-0; Chemical Formula: SF<T2>4</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1378</ITAG>OSHA's former Z tables had no exposure limits for sulfur tetrafluoride.The proposed PEL was 0.1 ppm as a ceiling; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table Nl) concurswith this limit, and the final rule establishes it. This limit is consistentwith that of the ACGIH. Sulfur tetrafluoride is a colorless, noncombustiblegas. On contact with moisture, sulfur tetrafluoride produces sulfur dioxideand hydrogen fluoride (HF) (Lester 1971, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 546), and it is the release of HF that is primarily responsible forsulfur tetrafluoride's toxic effects (Zapp 1971, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 546). A du Pont (1961, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 546)study of rats exposed for four hours to 4 ppm sulfur tetrafluoride overa period of 10 days reported that the animals demonstrated nasal discharge,difficulty in breathing, and weakness. Autopsies of these animals revealedevidence of emphysema, but those rats surviving exposure and given a two-weekrest period after exposure showed no significant pathological changes.In the same study by du Pont (1961, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.546), a four-hour exposure to 20 ppm sulfur tetrafluoride proved lethalto one of two rats. In a study by Clayton (1962/Ex. 1-409), irregular breathingand signs of irritation were observed following exposures to concentrationsof 20 ppm and lower; animals receiving lethal amounts of sulfur tetrafluorideshowed pulmonary edema on autopsy, and those with sublethal exposures demonstratedno pathologic changes 14 days later. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 0.1-ppm ceiling limit for thishighly toxic gas. The Agency concludes that establishing this limit forthis previously unregulated chemical will reduce the significant risk ofchronic respiratory effects potentially associated with exposure to sulfurtetrafluoride at the levels permitted by the absence of any OSHA limit.OSHA considers the chronic respiratory effects caused by exposure to sulfurtetrafluoride to be material impairments of health. NIOSH was the onlycommenter to the rulemaking record on this substance. <ITAG tagnum="71">TALC (CONTAINING NO ASBESTOS) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 14807-96-6; Chemical Formula: H<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2>Si \3/4\Mg </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1381</ITAG>The former OSHA PEL for nonasbestiform talc was 20 million particles percubic foot of air (mppcf) as an 8-hour TWA; when expressed as mg/m3, thisis comparable to 3 mg/m3. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 2 mg/m3 (15 mppcf)for talc, measured as respirable dust, and this is the limit proposed byOSHA and included in the final rule. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table Nl) concurredthat this limit is appropriate. Talc is a fine powder that is white togray-white in color; it is found as a mineral, and the main component isa crystalline hydrated silicate of magnesium that is usually in the formof plates but occasionally may be in the form of fibers. The health-effects evidence for talc is complicated by the fact that talcscontain amphiboles and other minerals, in addition to platiform talc crystals;adverse health effects appear to be related to the nonplatiform content(that is, to the fiber content) of the talc in question (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 550). There are conflicting views regarding the extent to whichthe fibrous constituents are asbestos; however, no health effects informationis available that is specifically related to fibrous talc (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 550). Numerous epidemiological studies have documented the effects on workersof long-term exposures to talc. In 1942, Porro et al. (1942, as cited inStokinger 1981b/Ex. 1-1127) published a report in which 15 cases of talcpneumoconiosis, including five postmortem examinations, showed that asbestoticbodies were almost always present in fibrotic areas of the lungs of thoseworkers with talcosis. Siegal and colleagues (1943, as cited in Stokinger1981b/Ex. 1-1127) noted that the incidence of advanced fibrosis in a groupof 221 talc miners and millers was 14.5 percent. These workers were primarilyexposed to fibrous talc, which was believed to be responsible for the pathologyof the asbestos-like lung lesions. A study by McLaughlin et al. (1949,as cited in Stokinger 1981b/Ex. 1-1127) revealed that talc-induced pneumoconiosiswas caused by the fibrous varieties of talc; in animal studies by Schepersand Durkan (1955, as cited in Stokinger 1981b/Ex. 1-1127), the degree offibrosis in the lung tissue was found to be a function of the length ofthe talc fibers, rather than of the composition of the talc itself. A paperby Kleinfeld, Giel, Majeranowski, and Messite (1963, as cited in Stokinger1981b/Ex. 1-1127) reported that postmortem examinations on six talc industryworkers showed that the asbestotic bodies found in the lung bronchiolesor embedded in fibrous tissue were indistinguishable from the asbestosbodies seen in cases of asbestosis.Kleinfeld, Messite, Kooyman, and Zaki (1967/Ex. 1-704) later conducteda cohort study of 220 workers who had been employed in a mine that producedtalc that had a tremolite and anthophyllite content. Of the 91 deaths inthis group, 10 resulted from respiratory cancer and 28 were attributedto pneumoconiosis. The proportional mortality rate from respiratory cancerwas four times the expected rate. In 1974, when Kleinfeld, Messite, andZaki (Ex. 1-705) performed a follow-up study of this group (which at thattime consisted of 260 workers [108 deaths]), they found significant differencesbetween the expected and observed mortality in the period 1950 to 1954,but not during 1960 to 1969. These investigators attributed this findingto the reduction in talc dust counts (from averages of 25 to 73 mppcf (approximately4 to 12 mg/m3) in the years 1948 to 1965 to averages of 9 to 43 mppcf (approximately1.5 to 6.5 mg/m3) in the period 1966 to 1969). This study also showed adecrease of greater than 50 percent in deaths due to pneumoconiosis inthe 1965-to-1969 time period.Studies by NIOSH (Dement and Zumwald 1978, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 552) of 398 white male workers employed between 1947 and 1959 in thetalc industries found that 74 of these men had died, and that bronchogeniccancer was the cause of death in nine men; only 3.3 deaths from this causewould have been expected. Nonmalignant respiratory disease (NMRD) exclusiveof influenza, pneumonia, and tuberculosis accounted for three deaths; 1.5would have been expected. From these data, NIOSH concluded that a significantincrease in mortality due to bronchogenic cancer and NMRD had occurredas a result of occupational exposure to talc dust. NIOSH's report alsoincluded a morbidity study of 12 talc industry workers, currently employed,in which chest X-rays, lung function tests, and questionnaires were used.This study concluded that a higher prevalence of cough, phlegm, dyspnea,and irregular opacities in chest X-rays existed in these workers than inpotash miners; instances of pleural thickening and calcification were greaterthan in coal and potash miners; and the pulmonary function of talc workersoverall was reduced in comparison with that of coal and potash miners employedfor the same length of time. The reductions in pulmonary function amongthe talc workers were dose- and duration-related.The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 552) concludes that serious health effectshave been associated in the past (i.e., prior to 1945) with exposures toamphibole-containing talc. However, the ACGIH believes that the introductionof mining improvements has all but eliminated ``the excess of death ratesfrom pneumoconiosis and lung cancer'' (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 552).Two recent studies of the health effects associated with talc exposures(Rubino, Scansetti, Piolatto, and Romano 1976/Ex. 1-801; Selevan, Dement,Wagoner, and Froines 1979/Ex. 1-989) are available. The Rubino, Scansetti,Piolatto, and Romano (1976/Ex. 1-801) study found that miners and millersexposed to an average of 849 to 8470 mppcf-years (miners) or 76 to 651mppcf-years (millers) showed no increase in the number of observed (comparedto expected) deaths from causes other than silicosis. These authors concludedthat the disease-causing factor in these workers was silica rather thantalc (Rubino, Scansetti, Piolatto, and Romano 1976/Ex. 1-801).The Selevan, Dement, Wagoner, and Froines (1979/Ex. 1-989) study of 392workers exposed to talc in five mines found nonmalignant respiratory deathsfor millers to be almost eight times the expected rate, while miners experiencedmore than three times the expected mortality rate for NMRD. The ACGIH (1986/Ex.1-3, p. 552) believes that the Selevan et al. (1979/Ex. 1-989) study isincomplete because confounding factors were not adequately identified andcontrolled for.With regard to NIOSH's findings (Dement and Zumwald 1978, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 552) of excess cancer deaths among talc workers, OSHAis currently reviewing the scientific and toxicological data describingthe effects of exposure to the nonasbestiform varieties of mineral fibersthat are found in talc deposits. OSHA is considering a separate rulemakingto address this issue.OSHA received few comments regarding its proposed revision to the PEL forrespirable talc. John W. Kelse, Corporate Industrial Hygienist for R.T.Vanderbilt, Inc. (Ex. 3-108), supported the proposed 2-mg/m3 respirabletalc PEL. Mr. Kelse also recommended that OSHA revise its Table Z-3 entryfor ``Talc (nonasbestiform)'' to ``Talc (not containing asbestos)'' andthe entry for ``Talc (fibrous)'' to ``Talc (containing asbestos).'' Thesechanges were suggested because of the potentially ambiguous meanings ofthe term ``fibrous'' and ``asbestiform.'' OSHA concurs with this suggestionand has accordingly revised the respective entries in Tables Z-1-A andZ-3 in this rulemaking. In response to a suggestion by Richard Bidstrup,representing the Rubber Manufacturers Association (Ex. 173, p. 9), OSHAhas also revised the entry for talc to clarify that the PEL is measuredas respirable dust.On a related issue, Mr. F.A. Renninger, Senior Vice President of the NationalStone Association (Ex. 3-528), suggested that OSHA delete or clarify itscurrent Table Z-3 entry for ``Tremolite (see talc fibrous)'' since it suggeststhat all forms of tremolite are considered to be asbestos. As Mr. Renningerpoints out, the applicability of OSHA's asbestos standard to the nonasbestiformvarieties of tremolite, actinolite, and anthophyllite is currently underadministrative stay, and OSHA is presently examining the health evidencefor these mineral varieties. However, during this period of administrativestay, exposure to the nonasbestiform varieties of these minerals is coveredby OSHA's comprehensive standard, which appears at 29 CFR 1910.1101. OSHAhas therefore revised the entry for tremolite in Table Z-3 to refer tothe standard at 29 CFR 1910.1101.OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 2 mg/m3 for the respirabledust of talc containing no asbestos fibers and less than 1 percent silica.The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workers from the significantrisk of nonmalignant respiratory effects associated with exposure to talcdust; OSHA considers these effects material impairments of health. Accordingto the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3), talc may, at times, occur in a fibrous form.At this time, OSHA has not made any determinations with regard to the possiblehealth consequences resulting from exposure to talc fibers.<ITAG tagnum="71">TIN OXIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-31-5; Chemical Formula: SnO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1395</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no exposure limit for tin oxide. The ACGIH has an exposurelimit of 2 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA. The proposed PEL was 2 mg/m3 as an 8-hourTWA PEL; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs, and this limit is establishedby the final rule. Tin oxide may be a white or yellow-brown powder.Injection of tin dust intraperitoneally into guinea pigs resulted in anonspecific, well-vascularized chronic granulomatous reaction (Oyanguren,Haddad, and Maass 1958/Ex. 1-652). Chronic exposure to tin oxide fume anddust results in stannosis, a form of pneumoconiosis. The fume of tin oxideis considered to be a more important source of stannosis than the dust(Dundon and Hughes 1950/Ex. 1-732), but other authorities consider thequality of the dust and the duration of exposure equally important (Robertsonand Whittaker 1955/Ex. 1-987). The onset of the symptoms of stannosis maybe delayed for years; the appearance of the condition is signalled by difficultyin breathing. One worker who had been exposed to unspecified tin oxidelevels for 22 years was tested for stannosis and registered a vital breathingcapacity 70 percent of normal and a maximal breathing capacity 61 percentof the predicted value (Spencer and Wycoff 1954/Ex. 1-611). More than 150 cases of stannosis have been reported in the world literature(Robertson and Whittaker 1955/Ex. 1-987), and five cases were reportedin the United States before 1954. No cases of massive fibrosis caused byexposure to tin oxide dust or fume have been reported (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 574). Only NIOSH commented on tin oxide. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 2 mg/m3 for tinoxide dust and fume. The Agency concludes that this limit will protectworkers from the significant risks of reduced pulmonary capacity and stannosis,which are considered material impairments of health, associated with exposureto this substance at the levels permitted by the absence of an OSHA limit.<ITAG tagnum="71">TRIMELLITIC ANHYDRIDE (TMAN) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 552-30-7; Chemical Formula: C<T2>9</T2>H<T2>4</T2>O<T2>5</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1409</ITAG>OSHA previously had no exposure limit for trimellitic anhydride. In 1981,the ACGIH set 0.005 ppm (0.04 mg/m3) as the 8-hour TWA limit for this substance.The proposed PEL was 0.005 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, and the final rule promulgatesthis limit. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table Nl) concurs with this limit. Trimelliticanhydride is a colorless solid. Exposure to trimellitic anhydride (TMAN) causes irritation of the eyes,nose, skin, and pulmonary tract. NIOSH (1978n, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 606) reported in a current intelligence bulletin that trimelliticanhydride should be considered an extremely toxic workplace hazard, becauseexposure to it can cause noncardiac pulmonary edema and immunological sensitization,as well as upper respiratory tract irritation. Pulmonary edema has occurred in workers exposed to TMAN at unreported airconcentrations; the development of pulmonary edema in these workers withoutupper respiratory tract irritation suggests that TMAN is a sensitizer (Rice,Jenkins, Gray, and Greenburg 1977/Ex. 1-358). Zeiss, Patterson, Pruzansky,and colleagues (1977/Ex. 1-501) described TMAN-related illnesses amonga group of workers synthesizing TMAN. These authors believe there are threeseparate syndromes associated with TMAN exposure: rhinitis/asthma; a flu-likecondition; and irritation of the upper respiratory tract. Another caseof TMAN-related occupational sensitization occurred in a worker exposedduring the application of an epoxy resin coating (Fawcett, Taylor, andPepys 1977/Ex. 1-636). At levels averaging 1.5 and 2.8 mg/m3 in two processes, NIOSH reportedthat employees reported eye and nose irritation, shortness of breath, coughing,nausea, headache, skin irritation, and throat irritation (NIOSH 1974c/Ex.1-1181). Pulmonary hemorrhage and hemolytic anemia have been reported inworkers exposed to TMAN at unspecified levels (Ahmad, Morgan, Pattersonet al. 1979/Ex. 1-460). Rats have shown intraalveolar hemorrhage after TMAN exposures to concentrationsof 0.01 ppm (Amoco Chemical Corporation 1978, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 606). Based on this study, in the final rule OSHA is revising the PEL for trimelliticanhydride to an 8-hour TWA level of 0.005 ppm. The Agency concludes thatthis limit will protect workers from the severe pulmonary effects, sensitization,and skin and upper respiratory tract irritation observed in workers exposedto this extremely toxic substance. The Agency has determined that theseeffects constitute material impairments of health. OSHA finds that thislimit will substantially reduce these significant risks, which were formerlynot controlled because of the absence of any OSHA PEL. <ITAG tagnum="71">WOOD DUST </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: None; Chemical Formula: None </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

However, in a 1985 enforcementproceeding before the Occupational Safety and HealthReview Commission,wood dust was held not to be covered by the nuisance dust standard, aninert mineral dust, and the Agency did not regulate this substance afterthis decision (12 OSHC 1785). Consequently, OSHA had no PEL for wood dustwhen this generic rulemaking was undertaken. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of1 mg/m3 for hard wood dust, and a TLV-TWA of 5 mg/m3 and STEL of 10 mg/m3for soft wood dust. OSHA proposed a 1-mg/m3 8-hour TWA for hard wood dustand a 5-mg/m3 8-hour TWA for soft wood dust. In the final rule, OSHA isestablishing a single 8-hour TWA of 5 mg/m3 and a STEL of 10 mg/m3 forall hard wood and soft wood dusts except Western red cedar. For Westernred cedar, a highly allergenic species of soft wood, the Agency is establishingan 8-hour TWA limit of 2.5 mg/m3. Wood dust is defined as any wood particlesarising from the processing or handling of woods. Hard woods derive fromthe deciduous broad-leaved flowering species of trees, and soft woods includethe coniferous species that do not shed their leaves in the winter. Exposure to wood dust has long been associated with a variety of adversehealth effects, including dermatitis, allergic respiratory effects, mucosaland nonallergic respiratory effects, and cancer. The toxicity data in animalsare limited, particularly with regard to exposure to wood dust alone; thereare, however, a large number of studies in humans. The discussion belowfirst describes some of the relevant toxicological studies and then presentsthe record evidence on wood dust.Animal StudiesGroups of male guinea pigs were injected intratracheally with suspensionscontaining 75 mg of sheesham or mango wood dust or of hemp or bagasse fibers,or 20 mg of jute fiber (Bhattacharjee, Dogra, Lal, and Zaidi 1979/Ex. 1-463;Bhattacharjee and Zaidi 1982/Ex 1-464). Animals were sacrificed seriallyat intervals up to 90 days after injection. Lung examination revealed that,at 90 days, Grade I fibrosis of the lungs had occurred in the guinea pigsinjected with mango or jute, while those treated with sheesham or hemphad developed Grade II pulmonary fibrosis.In another experiment involving guinea pigs, animals were exposed by inhalationto average respirable dust concentrations of 1143 mg/m3 for 30 minutes/day,5 days/week for 24 weeks (McMichael, DiPalma, Blumenstein et al. 1983,Ex. 1-644). Histopathological examination showed lung changes, describedby the authors as moderate to severe, in all exposed guinea pigs. The changesseen included an increase in septal connective tissue components and aggregationof lymphocytes; however, no pulmonary fibrosis or extensive destructionof the parenchymal tissue occurred. The authors of this study concludedthat exposure to fir bark dust may cause inflammatory changes in the lung.Two studies examined the effect of exposing Syrian golden hamsters to beechwood dust by inhalation, with or without concurrent administration of theknown carcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN) (Wilhelmsson, Hellquist, Olofsson,and Klintenberg 1985/Ex. 1-402; Wilhelmsson, Jernudd, Ripe, and Holmberg1985/Ex. 1-1042; Drettner, Wilhelmsson, and Lundh 1985/Ex. 1-312). In eachstudy, the animals were divided into four separate groups. In Study I,there were 12 animals per group. Two groups were exposed to fresh beechwood dust (a hard wood dust) at a mean total dust concentration of 15 mg/m3for six hours/day, five days/week for 36 weeks, and one of these groupswas also given 1.5 mg of DEN once a week for the first 12 weeks. The thirdgroup in Study I was given the DEN doses only (positive control), and thefourth group was given no exposure at all (negative control).In Study II, there were 24 animals in each of four groups. Two groups ofanimals were exposed to fresh beech wood dust at a mean total dust concentrationof 30 mg/m3 for six hours/day, five days/week for 40 weeks. The positiveand negative control groups were treated as in Study I.In Study I, none of the hamsters had lung or nasal tumors or metaplasia.Four hamsters exposed to wood dust and DEN exhibited squamous cell papillomasof the trachea, as did three animals in the positive control group andone in the negative control group. No differences in organs other thanthe respiratory organs were seen between the treated and control groupsin Study I.In Study II, all DEN-exposed hamsters had nasal lesions ranging from hyperplasiasand dysplasias to papillomas. In addition, half of all DEN-exposed hamstersdeveloped nasal adenocarcinomas, whether or not they had also been exposedto wood dust. Half of the DEN-exposed animals also had papillomas of thelarynx and trachea. In the wood-dust-exposure-only group, two of the animalshad nasal lesions, one of which was an unclassifiable malignant nasal tumorand the other of which consisted of focal metaplasia with mild dysplasia.The authors concluded that exposure to wood dust did not increase the tumorincidence in DEN-exposed animals but did affect the respiratory tract ofall exposed animals.Human Studies<T3>Dermatitis. </T3>There are a large number of case reports, epidemiologicalstudies, and other data on the health effects of wood dust exposure inhumans. Dermatitis caused by exposure to wood dusts is common, and canbe caused either by chemical irritation, sensitization (allergic reaction),or both of these together. As many as 300 species of trees have been implicatedin wood-caused dermatitis.The chemicals associated with allergic reactions are generally found inthe inner parts of a tree, e.g., the heartwood, and the workers most proneto these reactions are those involved in secondary wood processing (e.g.,carpenters, joiners, and finishers).The symptoms of sensitization are redness, scaling, and itching, whichmay progress to vesicular dermatitis and, after repeated exposures, tochronic dermatitis. The parts of the body most often affected are the hands,forearms, eyelids, face, neck, and genitals. This form of dermatitis generallyappears after a few days or weeks of contact.<T3>Allergic respiratory effects. </T3>Allergic respiratory responses aremediated by the immune system, as is also the case with allergic dermatitis.Many authors have reported cases of allergic reactions in workers exposedto wood dust (Sosman, Schlueter, Fink, and Barboriak 1969/Ex. 1-444; Greenberg1972/Ex. 1-482; Pickering, Batten, and Pepys 1972/Ex. 1-655; Eaton 1973/Ex.1-478; Booth, LeFoldt, and Moffitt 1976/Ex. 1-466; Chan-Yeung, Ashley,Corey et al. 1978/Ex. 1-622; Edwards, Brooks, Henderson, and Apol 1978/Ex.1-950; Innocenti and Angotzi 1980/Ex. 1-1036; Bush and Clayton 1983/Ex.1-469; Cartier, Chan, Malo et al. 1986/Ex. 1-472). Asthma is the most commonresponse to wood dust exposure, and the allergic nature of such reactionshas been demonstrated by the presence of IgE antibodies and positive skinreactions on patch testing. The best-studied of the allergic reactionsto wood dust is Western red cedar (WRC) asthma; it is estimated that 5percent of the workers handling this species are allergic to it. However,only one study is available that relates exposure level to ventilatoryfunction. In that study, exposure to concentrations of 2 mg/m3 of WRC dustcaused significant decreases in forced vital capacity and forced expiratoryvolume (Vedal, Chan-Yeung, Enarson et al. 1986/Ex. 1-397). These authorsalso found that exposures to concentrations above 3 mg/m3 produced eyeirritation.<T3>Mucosal and nonallergic respiratory effects. </T3>This section discusseschanges in the structure and function of the nasal mucosa and respiratorytract that are caused by exposure to wood dust. These changes include nasaldryness, irritation, bleeding, and obstruction; coughing, wheezing, andsneezing; sinusitis; and prolonged colds. These symptoms have been observedeven at wood dust concentrations below 4 mg/m3.Bellion, Mattei, and Treves (1964, as cited in NIOSH 1987a/Ex. 1-1005)found that 97 of 225 workers (carpenters, sawmill workers, woodworkers)exposed from 3 to 24 years to the dust of several different hard woodsshowed radiologic evidence of pulmonary abnormalities. Black, Evans, Hadfieldet al. (1974/Ex. 1-299) studied nine woodworkers from a woodworking factoryin England. In all of these workers, mucociliary movement was markedlydepressed, leading these authors to conclude that exposure to wood dustin the furniture industry for 10 years or more can impair mucociliary clearance.These findings were confirmed in a Danish study involving furniture makers(Solgaard and Andersen 1975/Ex. 1-443; Andersen, Solgaard, and Andersen1976/Ex. 1-297; Andersen, Andersen, and Solgaard 1977/Ex. 1-296); comparedwith controls, the mucociliary transport rate was also significantly impairedin these woodworkers, and dose-response effects were noted.A respiratory survey conducted by Chan-Yeung, Giclas, and Henson (1980/Ex.1-474) in pulp and paper mill workers in British Columbia showed that workersexposed to wood dust at a mean total dust concentration of 0.5 mg/m3 hada slight but statistically significant decrease in pulmonary function valuescompared with controls. The authors concluded that the chemical preservativesused to treat the wood could also have been responsible for these adverseeffects.In a cross-sectional survey of 1,157 American woodworkers (both hard andsoft wood), Whitehead, Ashikaga, and Vacek (1981/Ex. 1-454) found thatexposure to higher (10+mg-years/m3), as compared with lower (0 to 2 mg-years/m3),dust concentrations was associated with a statistically significant andhigher incidence of decreased pulmonary function. However, dose-responseeffects were observed only for soft wood (i.e., pine) dusts. A later studyby Beckman, Ashikaga, and Whitehead (1980, as cited in NIOSH 1987a/Ex.1-1005) examined subgroups of the workers studied by Whitehead and foundno correlation between years of exposure to pine wood dust and pulmonaryfunction.In a pilot study of 55 workers in a North Carolina hardwood furniture plant,Goldsmith (1983, as cited in NIOSH 1987a/Ex. 1-1005) found that, at meanarea wood dust concentrations of 2 mg/m3 or below, peak ventilatory flowcorrelated significantly with cumulative person-years of exposure. Goldsmithinterpreted this finding to mean that inhalation of wood dust may impairlarge-airway function.A study of Italian woodworkers showed that the number of wood-dust-exposedworkers who had developed anosmia (loss of smell) was significantly higherthan in a control group of nonexposed workers (Innocenti, Valiani, Vessioet al. 1985/Ex. 1-1037). Amoore (1986/Ex. 1-1029) confirmed this findingin other workers exposed to hardwood dusts.<T3>Summary of mucosal and nonallergic respiratory effects. </T3>A largenumber of studies have demonstrated that occupational exposure to wooddust causes both statistically significant and nonsignificant increasesin respiratory symptoms at exposure levels as low as 2 mg/m3. These symptomsrange from irritation to bleeding, wheezing, sinusitis, and prolonged colds.In addition, chronic wood dust exposure causes mucociliary stasis (i.e.,the absence of effective clearance) in the nose and, in some workers, alsocauses changes in the nasal mucosa. Several studies have demonstrated decreasedpulmonary function among wood-dust-exposed workers, although other studieshave not confirmed these findings.CarcinogenicityThe association between occupational exposure to wood dust and variousforms of cancer has been explored in many studies and in many countries.In 1987, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifiedfurniture manufacturing in Category I (confirmed human carcinogen) andcarpentry in Category 2B (suspected human carcinogen). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47)considers both hard and soft wood dust to be potentially carcinogenic inhumans; for soft wood dust, NIOSH recommends a separate 6(b) rulemaking(Ex. 8-47, Table N6B). NIOSH concurred, however, with the proposed PELof 1 mg/m3 TWA for hard wood dust (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A).The discussion below focuses on selected U.S. studies.<T3>Nasal and sinus cavity cancer. </T3>The earliest U.S. study of wooddust exposure and nasal cancer was conducted by Brinton, Stone, Blot, andFraumeni (Ex. 1-468) in 1976. These authors analyzed cancer death ratesbetween 1950 and 1969 in 132 U.S. counties having at least l percent oftheir population employed in furniture and wood-fixture manufacturing.This study revealed that the age-adjusted mortality rate for cancer ofthe nasal cavity and sinuses among white males in the ``furniture'' countieswas significantly higher than in nonfurniture counties.In a later case-control study, these authors (Brinton, Blot, Becker etal. 1984/Ex. 1-467) analyzed cases of nasal and sinus cancers occurringin North Carolina and Virginia between 1970 and 1980. This study identifieda significantly elevated risk of adenocarcinomas in males working in thefurniture manufacturing industry, but no increased risk among lumber, carpentry,or construction workers. There was no significant increase in the riskof squamous cell carcinoma in workers from any other wood-related industry.In a study sponsored by the Inter-Industry Wood Dust Task Force, Viren,Vogt, and Dixon (1982, as cited in NIOSH 1987a/Ex. 1-1005) described adeath certificate case-control study of nasal cancer deaths for 1963 to1977 in North Carolina, Mississippi, Washington, and Oregon. Findings ofthis study included a relative nasal cancer risk of 1.95 for industriesinvolving lumber and wood products; however, no significant relative riskof nasal cancer was seen for workers in the furniture-manufacturing industry.Imbus and Dyson conducted a study of nasal cancer and North Carolina furnitureworkers (1985, as cited in NIOSH 1987a/Ex. 1-1005). This study found: (1)that there was a statistically significant increase of nasal cancer amongfurniture workers; (2) that the nasal cancer rates among North Carolinafurniture workers were much lower than those reported for English furnitureworkers; (3) that the number of nasal cancer deaths among North Carolinafurniture workers decreased between 1956 and 1977; and (4) that a slightexcess in nasal cancer may have existed among North Carolina furnitureworkers but is currently either declining or nonexistent.At present, the National Cancer Institute is conducting a cohort mortalitystudy of 36,622 workers employed in the wood, metal, and plastic furnituremanufacturing industries (Miller et al. 1988, as cited in NIOSH 1987a/Ex.1-1005). Results are too preliminary to be described at this time.<T3>Summary of evidence for nasal and sinus cavity cancers. </T3>NIOSH(1987a/Ex. 1-1005) concluded that the literature clearly demonstrates anassociation between occupational wood dust exposure and nasal cancer. Englishstudies first identified this link by showing a 10- to 20-times-greaterincidence of nasal adenocarcinoma among woodworkers in the furniture industrythan among other woodworkers and 100 times greater than in the generalpopulation. In the United States, three studies have reported a fourfoldrisk of nasal cancer or adenocarcinoma in furniture workers, and anotherstudy noted a similar relationship between nasal cancer and wood dust exposure.One other study failed to find such an association for furniture workers,but did find an increase among logging and timber industry workers.<T3>Pulmonary cancer. </T3>A number of studies investigating the associationbetween wood dust exposure and the development of lung cancer have beenconducted. Milham (1974/Ex. 1-943) found a significant excess of malignanttumors of the bronchus and lung in workers who had belonged to the AFL-CIOUnited Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. Only constructionworkers showed a statistically significant increase in lung cancer rate.In a study of lung cancer in Florida residents, Blot, Davies, Brown etal. (1982/Ex. 1-465) found that an elevated risk of lung cancer that wasstatistically significant existed among workers in the lumber and woodindustry and in construction; however, smoking may have been a confoundingfactor in these results.<T3>Summary of evidence for pulmonary cancer. </T3>The association betweenlung cancer and occupational wood dust exposure is inconclusive, althoughseveral epidemiological studies have reported increases in lung canceramong wood-dust-exposed workers.<T3>Hodgkin's disease. </T3>The data on the relationship between exposureto wood dust and the development of Hodgkin's disease are conflicting.Milham (1967/Ex. 1-750) and Milham and Hesser (1967/Ex. 1-645) concluded,on the basis of a case-cohort study of 1,549 white males dying of thisdisease between 1940-1953 and 1957-1964, that there was an associationbetween Hodgkin's disease and exposure to wood dust.Another study (Spiers 1969/Ex. 1-445) concluded that men working in thewood industries in the eastern United States were at special risk for Hodgkin'sdisease, and suggested that pine pollen exposure might be responsible forthe increase.A Washington State epidemiological study (Petersen and Milham 1974/Ex.1-654) also found that woodworkers had an increased risk of Hodgkin's disease,and the work of these authors was supported by the results of another study(Grufferman, Duong, and Cole 1976/Ex. 1-484), which showed a nonsignificantincrease in the relative risk for Hodgkin's disease among woodworkers.<T3>Summary of evidence for Hodgkin's disease. </T3>Although the data areconflicting, several epidemiological studies of U.S. workers do reportincreases in the incidence of Hodgkin's disease among woodworkers. Thisexcess is particularly apparent among carpenters.<T3>Other cancers.</T3> NIOSH (1987a/Ex. 1-1005) concluded that the dataon the relationship between occupational exposure to wood dust and thedevelopment of cancers other than nasal, Hodgkin's disease, or lung cancersare insufficient and inconclusive.Record EvidenceMany participants submitted comments to the record pertaining to wood dust(see, for example, Exs. 8-34, 3-748, 3-233, 3-349, 3-362, 3-626, 3-682,3-824, 3-836, 3-859, 3-899, 3-955, 3-1160, 3-917, 115, 127, 131, 141, 155,168, 183, 191, 194, 3-1453, 195, 196, 189, 82, 80, and 3-911; Tr. 12, pp.144 to 455). These commenters described their facilities and woodworkingprocesses, employee safety and health programs, and concerns about theimpact of the proposed rule's limits for wood dust on their industries.The issues raised by these participants concerned the following topics:(1) The technological and economic feasibility of the proposed limits;(2) The justification for a separate standard for soft wood and hard wood;(3) The health effects evidence;(4) The appropriate levels for the final rule's PELs; and(5) The evidence for a separate limit for allergenic wood dusts.The discussions below deal with each of these points in turn.Representatives from many affected segments of the wood industry statedthat achieving the proposed limits of 1 mg/m3 for hard wood and 5 mg/m3for soft wood would be technologically or economically infeasible or extremelydifficult (Exs. 8-34, 3-917, 168, 183, 191, 80, and 3-911). OSHA has determinedthat, at the present time, the health evidence suggests that a single PELof 5 mg/m3 is appropriate for both hard and soft wood dust, with the exceptionof Western red cedar, for which a PEL of 2.5 mg/m3 is being set. Theserevised PELs have been determined to be feasible (see the detailed discussionof these issues in the Technological Feasibility and Economic Impact sectionsof this preamble).OSHA proposed separate permissible exposure limits for soft wood (5 mg/m3)and hard wood (1 mg/m3). The Agency received comments on this topic frommany participants; these commenters were unanimously opposed to the settingof separate limits for these two types of wood dust (Exs. 8-34, 3-748,3-682, 3-859, 3-899, 3-917, 191, 196, 80G, 80L, 80N, and 3-911; Tr. XII,pp. 12-290, 12-326, and 12-331). These participants stated that there wasno health basis for making a distinction between hard wood and soft wooddusts (Exs. 33-899, 3-955, 3-917, and 191; Tr. 12, pp. 326-331; Tr. 12,p. 290). According to Dr. Harold Imbus, speaking for the Inter-IndustryWood Dust Coordinating Committee (Tr. pp. 12-58, 12-60), the distinctionbetween the two woods derived from the fact that the early studies showingan increased cancer incidence in woodworking employees involved Britishfurniture makers, who predominantly used hard wood; this association causedinvestigators to attribute greater toxicity to hard wood dust.Commenters were of the opinion that this distinction was no longer warrantedby the evidence; in fact, Dr. Lawrence Whitehead, certified industrialhygienist and a professor at the University of Texas School of Public Health(Tr. p. 12-331), stated that his own work suggested that some soft wooddust exposures might actually produce stronger adverse effects than equivalentexposures to some hard wood dusts.Other commenters reported that it is not possible to distinguish soft woodfrom hard wood dust except by chemical analysis (Ex. 8-34, p. 28), thatmost facilities in the wood industries use both hard and soft woods (Exs.3-682, 3-859, and 3-899), and that the distinction between the two typesof woods is inappropriate (Ex. 3-917). For example, Joseph Gerard, VicePresident of the American Furniture Manufacturers Association (Ex. 3-917)stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">The distinction between hard woods and soft woods is purely botanical.Many so-called ``softwoods'' are actually hard (i.e., Douglas fir as asoftwood is harder than the hardwood birch) and one of the softest woodsin existence (balsa) is botanically a hardwood (Ex. 3-917, p. 2).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Jamie Cohen, speaking for the United Petitioners, a coalition of laborunions (Tr. 12, p. 294), believes that a bifurcated standard for the twotypes of dusts would place an undue burden on employers and could leadto compliance problems. The posthearing brief submitted by the United Brotherhoodof Carpenters and Joiners of America (Ex. 196) reiterated these pointsby stating: ``Given the frequent intermixture of wood types in the workplace,this [setting two separate standards] would render OSHA's compliance effortsvirtually worthless'' (Ex. 196, p. 7).After a review of this record evidence, OSHA has determined that the healthevidence for the toxicity of wood dust cannot be separately distinguishedfor soft wood and hard wood. In addition, the Agency is convinced by themany comments from wood industry employers that most operations involveboth kinds of wood and are performed on the same machines and equipmentand in the same facility. Thus, any controls installed to reduce exposureswould of necessity need to be sufficient to reduce airborne dust levelsto the lower of the two limits (i.e., to the proposed wood dust limit of1 mg/m3). According to the Inter-Industry Wood Dust Coordinating Committee:<ITAG tagnum="21">[I]mposition of a limit of 1 mg/m3 for hardwood dust and 5 mg/m3 forsoftwood dust effectively imposes a limit of 1 mg/m3 on a large numberof plants, including those where only small amounts of hardwood are used(Ex. 3-748, p. 3).</ITAG>Many commenters took exception to the review of the health effects evidencefor wood dust presented by OSHA in the preamble to the proposed rule. Objectionswere raised by the Inter-Industry Wood Dust Coordinating Committee (Exs.8-34, 3-748, and 168), the Appalachian Hardwood Manufacturers (Ex. 3-626),the American Furniture Manufacturers Association (Exs. 3-917 and 191),the Georgia-Pacific Corporation (Exs. 3-955 and 183), the Hardwood PlywoodManufacturing Association (Ex. 3-911), and others.These participants criticized many of the individual studies describedby OSHA; some commenters found fault with several of these studies on thegrounds that they involved British or other non-U.S. woodworkers (see,for example, Exs. 8-34, 191, 3-626, and 3-917), involved only a small numberof subjects (see, for example, Exs. 8-34, 168, and 191), had inconsistentresults (see, for example, Ex. 8-34), or failed to demonstrate a dose-responserelationship between wood dust exposure and the health effect of concern(see, for example, Exs. 8-34, 3-626, 3-917, and 191). The Inter-IndustryWood Dust Coordinating Committee (IWDCC) stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">[T]he observations in the European studies are not representativeof conditions in U.S. workplaces, especially under modern conditions. .. .</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The English and other European experience does not provide an accuratepredictive model for the incidence of nasal cancer. . . . The excessesof nasal cancer observed in the European studies simply have not been observedin the United States at any time . . . (Ex. 3-748, pp. 2, 52).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">OSHA agrees with the IWDCC that the <T3>incidence </T3>of nasal cancer seen in the United States is substantiallylower than that seen in other countries, particularly in Great Britain.However, the Agency does not agree that excesses in nasal cancers, andparticularly of nasal adenocarcinomas, have not been observed in Americanwoodworkers. Several U.S. studies have reported excesses in nasal cancerrisks among employees in the wood industries (Brinton, Stone, Blot, andFraumeni 1976/Ex. 1-468; Brinton, Blot, Becker et al. 1984/Ex. 1-467; Viren,Vogt, and Dixon 1982, and Imbus and Dyson 1985, both as cited in NIOSH1987a/Ex. 1-1005).In response to those commenters who argued that none of the studies describedby OSHA presented sufficient dose-response data to be used as a basis forestablishing a limit, the Agency emphasizes that it is not relying on anysingle study to determine that wood dust presents a significant risk ofmaterial health impairment. Instead, OSHA is making this determinationon the basis of the findings in the dozens of studies reporting on therespiratory, irritant, allergic, and carcinogenic properties of wood dust.The Agency finds the results of these studies biologically plausible andtheir findings reproducible and consistent. It is true that some of thesestudies, like all human studies, have limitations of sample size, involveconfounding exposures, have exposure measurement problems, and often donot produce the kind of dose-response data that can be obtained when experimentalanimals are subjected to controlled laboratory conditions. What the largegroup of studies being relied upon by OSHA to establish the significanceof the risk associated with exposure to wood dust do show is that the overallweight of evidence that such exposures are harmful and cause loss of functionalcapacity and material impairment of health is convincing beyond a reasonabledoubt.The industry strongly supported a single 5-mg/m3 standard for both hardwood and soft wood dusts (Exs. 8-34, 3-626, 3-682, 3-824, 3-899, 3-1160,3-917, 168J, 183, 191, 80 and attachments, and 3-911); some commenters(Exs. 3-859, 194, and 196) argued for a 1-mg/m3 limit for all wood dust,while others (Exs. 3-955, 155, and 183) were of the opinion that the nuisancedust limit of 10 mg/m3 was appropriate for wood dust. The United Petitioners(Tr. p. 12-294) strongly endorsed a 1-mg/m3 standard for wood dust of alltypes on the grounds that the available health evidence clearly supportsthis limit.OSHA finds that the health evidence in the record as a whole does not supporta PEL of 1 mg/m3 for all wood dusts. In addition, the Agency believes thata 1-mg/m3 limit would present serious problems of feasibility for affectedparties (see Section VII, Summary Economic Impact and Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis). The Agency also finds that the health evidence clearly indicatesthat occupational exposure to wood dust poses a significant risk of materialhealth impairment at the 10-mg/m3 (or particulate) level. OSHA concludesthat establishing an 8-hour PEL of 5 mg/m3 and a 15-minute STEL of 10 mg/m3for all wood dusts (except Western red cedar) will substantially reducethis significant risk. The final rule establishes an 8-hour TWA PEL of 2.5 mg/m3 for Western redcedar wood dust, based on its widely recognized ability to cause immune-system-mediatedallergic sensitization. Evidence in the record demonstrates the seriousnessof this effect. A study by Brooks, Edwards, Apol, and Edwards (1980) thatwas submitted by the United Petitioners (Ex. 82D) reports that<ITAG tagnum="20">a high prevalence of occupational asthma was observed among workersexposed to WRC wood dust (Ex. 82D, p. 315).</ITAG>At the hearing, Dr. Brooks described occupational asthma as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">[T]here are spasms of the bronchial tubes, there is reduced air flowon expiration . . . [the extent of which depends] on the extent of theexposure, and also . . . on the duration of the exposure . . . as a consequenceof this sensitization and airway injury from the sensitization and theasthmatic reaction and the various biochemical and cellular changes thatoccur, there develops an associated process . . . the airways develop anincreased sensitivity and an increased bronchospastic responsiveness tomany different non-specific stimuli. So such things as cold air, dust,fumes, gases that are non-specific and wouldn't normally . . . [affect]most individuals [will affect] the individual with occupational asthma.And it's [such] hyper-reactive airways that cause individuals to continueto have disability and to continue to have symptoms once they leave thework place. . . . They develop this non-specific bronchial hyper-reactivitywhich may last the rest of their life (Tr. pp. 12-339 to 12-343).</ITAG>Some commenters (Exs. 8-34, 183, and 191) opposed the establishment ofa separate PEL for Western red cedar. These participants argued that alower PEL ``for wood dust generally would be necessary or appropriate toaddress allergic symptoms'' (Ex. 8-34, Health Effects Comments, p. 8, footnote6). According to the Inter-Industry Wood Dust Coordinating Committee (IIWDCC):<ITAG tagnum="21">[P]revention of allergic reactions is best achieved by good housekeepingmeasures directed specifically at the allergenic species (Ex. 8-34, p.8).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Among the work practices recommended by these commenters were maintainingclean work spaces, wearing protective clothing, and avoiding skin contactwith the allergenic species (Ex. 8-34, Health Effects Comments, p. 17).Although OSHA endorses training, good work practices, and the use of appropriateprotective clothing, the Agency does not agree that a reduced PEL for Westernred cedar (WRC) is unnecessary. The health effects associated with occupationalexposure to WRC are too severe not to be cause for concern. In addition,there is good evidence in the record of the dose-response relationshipbetween occupational exposure to WRC dust and woodworkers' asthma. A studyby Vedal, Chan-Yeung, Enarson et al. (1986/Ex. 1-397) shows such a relationship,with asthma beginning at a WRC level of 3.4 mg/m3 and a statistically significantreduction in forced respiratory capacity noted in workers exposed to 2mg/m3 WRC dust or more. Harold Imbus, a physician representing the IIWDCC,stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">This study, small though it may be, tends to support dose response,and a threshold level between 2 and 3.4 mg/m3 for the protection of effectsof WRC (Ex. 8-34, p. 7).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The 1980 study by Brooks, Edwards, Apol, and Edwards found a dose-relatedrelationship between total WRC dust level and prevalence of asthma in employeesin jobs with the greatest dust exposures. The Brooks et al. study foundasthma in zero percent of WRC workers exposed at 0.5 mg/m3; however, at3.56 mg/m3, this percentage rose to 5 percent. The United Petitioners submitted a 1988 paper by Goldsmith and Shy thatfound that there is a clearly defined asthma syndrome produced by WRC (Ex.3-362). OSHA finds these studies convincing evidence of WRC's allergenicpotential; in addition, the Agency believes that a threshold for occupationalasthma exists and lies between 2 and 3.4 mg/m3. Based on this evidence,OSHA concludes that an 8-hour PEL of 2.5 mg/m3 is necessary to protectworkers from the significant and often permanent effects of immune-mediatedoccupational asthma associated with exposure to WRC dust at levels abovethis limit. Several record comments agree that a separate PEL for WRC dustis warranted and that the threshold level is as described above (see, forexample, Exs. 8-34 (Imbus review, p. 6), 168, and 191; Tr. p. 12-292; Tr.pp. 12-317, 12-318, and 12-320). Some commenters (Tr. p. 12-316) were of the opinion that many other woods,such as Douglas fir, pine, red and white oak, redwood, walnut, spruce,boxwood, cocobolo, teak, mahogany, and others, should also be designatedby OSHA as allergenic in this rulemaking. However, OSHA finds that, asDr. Imbus of the IIWDCC notes, ``it is unlikely that species other thanWRC are responsible for large numbers of cases of respiratory allergies''(Ex. 8-34, Imbus review, p. 6). The authors of the Goldsmith and Shy (1988)paper concur:<ITAG tagnum="21">Other commonly used woods such as oak, birch, redwood, pine, teak,alder, and hemlock, produce pulmonary effects that are less well describedthan the asthma responses to Western red cedar (Ex. 3-362,   p. 13).</ITAG>The IIWDCC contends that, at the present time, there is ``no consensuseven as to which species should be considered allergenic'' (Ex. 168). OSHAconcludes that other species are somewhat allergenic. The evidence in theliterature does not indicate that any other species is nearly as allergenicas WRC or would cause nearly as high a proportion of allergic reactionsamong exposed workers. However, the Agency will monitor the literatureon these other potentially allergenic species so that other woods withdemonstrably allergenic properties can be identified in the future. Based on the evidence presented above, OSHA is establishing a PEL of 5mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA and 10 mg/m3 as a 15-minute STEL for hard and softwood dust, with the exception of Western red cedar, for which a PEL of2.5 mg/m3 (8-hour TWA) is being established. OSHA concludes that promulgationof these exposure limits will substantially reduce the significant riskof material impairment in the form of pulmonary dysfunction (includingchanges in peak flow, interference with mucociliary clearance, respiratorysymptoms, and chronic effects) that is associated with exposure to wooddust at the higher levels that would be permitted in the absence of anylimit.<ITAG tagnum="81">Conclusions For All Respiratory Toxicants </ITAG>As Table C6-2 and the discussions above show, limits for the respiratorytoxins have been established to control employee exposures to or belowthe airborne concentrations of these substances that have been associatedwith the development of acute or chronic respiratory effects. For mostof these substances, the evidence is sufficient to identify the NOE orlow-effect levels that are related to these effects in humans or animals.Accordingly, OSHA concludes that maintaining employee exposures at or belowthese limits will greatly decrease the likelihood that employees will beat significant risk of respiratory effects when they are exposed to thesesubstances in the workplace. Because the chronic pulmonary disease causedby exposure to toxic dusts is often incapacitating, such exposures caneffectively end the working life of severely affected individuals. Less-seriouspulmonary disease can result in lost workdays, both as a result of theassociated symptoms themselves and as a consequence of increased susceptibilityto respiratory infections. The effects of exposure to acute pulmonary toxins,such as ozone or trimellitic anhydride, range from reduced lung functionto life-threatening pulmonary edema. OSHA has determined that these adversepulmonary effects constitute material impairments of health. Lowering theAgency's former limits or establishing limits where none previously existedwill substantially reduce these significant occupational risks. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Substances For Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of CardiovascularEffects </ITAG>Introduction For seven chemicals, OSHA is revising or establishing limits based on theiradverse effects on the cardiovascular system. Table C7-1 lists the former,proposed, and final Z-table limits for these substances, along with theirCAS numbers and HS numbers. OSHA is revising its current ceiling limitsfor two substances (ethylene glycol dinitrate and nitroglycerin) by replacingthem with lower short-term limits. OSHA is reducing the TWA-PEL for carbondisulfide to 4 ppm and adding a STEL of 12 ppm. For one other substance(fluorotrichloromethane), OSHA is replacing its current TWA-PEL with aceiling value; for 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane, OSHA is addinga STEL to its existing 8-hour TWA. The Agency is establishing new limitsfor two cardiovascular toxins, chloropentafluoroethane and sodium azide.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus. 0800</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>Description of the Health Effects Although the cardiovascular system can be adversely affected in many differentways by exposure to toxic substances, the adverse effects caused by exposureto the seven chemicals in Table C7-1 are limited to three categories: (1)cardiac sensitization; (2) vasodilation; and (3) atherosclerosis. Becausethese effects can have potentially disabling or life-threatening outcomes,OSHA has determined that these effects clearly constitute material impairmentsof health and functional capacity. <T3>Cardiac sensitization </T3>is not mediated by the immune system anddoes not cause an allergic reaction. Instead, this form of sensitizationoccurs when a chemical ``sensitizes'' the heart to the effects of a classof biological compounds called sympathomimetic amines. The physiologicalaction of sympathomimetic amines is to stimulate the heart to beat faster.The hormone adrenaline, also called epinephrine, is an example of a sympathomimeticamine. Adrenaline is normally secreted into the bloodstream when the bodyanticipates an increase in physical exertion, such as occurs when someoneis frightened. A concentration of epinephrine equal to or higher than theno-effect level for this substance is necessary to increase the heartbeatrate in exposed individuals. The effect of a cardiac sensitizer is to lowerthe no-effect level so that the heartbeat rate is stimulated by a lowerconcentration of adrenaline. The region of the heart that becomes sensitizedis the pacemaking and conduction system, which determines the rhythm andrate of the heartbeat. Unregulated or unnecessary interference with thisregion of the heart can result in arrhythmia, an abnormality in the rhythmor rate of the heartbeat (Levy 1985/Ex. 1-210). The clinical consequencesof an arrhythmia vary among individuals, e.g., a young person with a healthyheart may not be adversely or seriously affected by an arrhythmia. However,fatal arrhythmias have occurred in healthy young people and, in older peopleor in individuals whose cardiovascular systems have already been compromised,arrhythmias can cause symptoms of cerebral or myocardial ischemia, shock,or congestive heart failure. <T3>Vasodilators </T3>are compounds that cause blood vessels to expand,resulting in a decrease in blood pressure (hypotension) and a decreasein the amount of blood reaching the organs. Acute hypotension is a commoncause of shock (<T3>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, </T3>10th ed., Petersdorfet al. 1983). Chronic hypotension may result in a number of symptoms, includinglethargy, weakness, easy fatigability, and dizziness or faintness. <T3>Atherosclerosis </T3>is a serious disease produced by a degenerativeprocess in the arteries. Plaques containing lipids, complex carbohydrates,blood products, and calcium form on the inside walls of arteries, usuallyon major blood vessels. These plaques are also called atheromas; theirpresence makes arteries narrower. Depending on which arteries in the bodycontain atheromas, different clinical consequences may result; these includerenal hypertension, stroke, and myocardial ischemia (inadequate circulationof blood to the myocardium) (Balazs, Hanig, and Herman 1986/Ex. 1-176).Some chemicals can enhance or accelerate the formation of atheromas andthereby encourage the development of atherosclerosis, a major cause ofcoronary heart disease. Dose-Response Relationships and Cardiac Effects For four of the chemicals in Table C7-1 (carbon disulfide, ethylene glycoldinitrate, nitroglycerin, and sodium azide), the final rule's limits arebased primarily on health surveys and case reports indicating that occupationallyexposed workers subjected to concentrations above a no-adverse-effect levelexperience these cardiovascular effects. However, human data for the otherthree chemicals (chloropentafluoroethane, fluorotrichloromethane, and 1,1,2-trichloro-,1,2-trifluoro-ethane)are scarce. For these chemicals, limits are based on the results of studiesin laboratory animals. Chemically induced cardiovascular disease occurs in a pattern that correspondsto a typical effect-level dose-response relationship; that is, an exposurelevel and exposure duration exist below which the substance appears unlikelyto exert an adverse effect. Thus, the limits for substances in this groupare designed to maintain exposures below this apparent no-adverse-effectlevel. The following discussions describe the record evidence and OSHA's findingsfor some substances in this group and point to the seriousness of the cardiovasculareffects associated with exposure to these substances.<ITAG tagnum="71">CARBON DISULFIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-15-0; Chemical Formula: CS<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1070</ITAG>OSHA's former limits for carbon disulfide were 20 ppm as an 8-hour TWA,a 30-minute STEL of 30 ppm, and a ceiling limit of 100 ppm that was neverto be exceeded. OSHA proposed revising these limits to 1 ppm as an 8-hourTWA and 10 ppm as a 15-minute STEL, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) supportedthese proposed limits. OSHA has evaluated all of the evidence and testimonypresented in the record and has determined that a 4-ppm 8-hour TWA limit,a 12-ppm STEL, and a skin notation are necessary to reduce the risk ofcardiovascular disease and reproductive effects among carbon-disulfide-exposedworkers, and the Agency is establishing these limits for carbon disulfidein the final rule. The need for a lower limit is based on evidence thatexposure to carbon disulfide presents risks of cardiovascular, fetotoxic,and neurological material impairment of health. OSHA's decision to promulgate a 4-ppm limit rather than the proposed 1-ppmlimit is principally based on the feasibility evidence available to OSHA(see Section VII, Technological Feasibility and Economic Impact Assessment).A skin notation has been added because there is evidence that carbon disulfidecan cause systemic toxicity via the dermal route. Carbon disulfide is aclear, colorless, or faintly yellow liquid with a strong, disagreeableodor. OSHA's proposal to reduce the limits for carbon disulfide was based ona number of human studies reviewed by the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) and NIOSH(1977b/Ex. 1-260) that suggested that exposure to carbon disulfide levelsbetween 10 and 40 ppm was associated with an excess risk of coronary heartdisease and of adverse neurological effects. These reports comprise a seriesof studies carried out on carbon-disulfide-exposed workers in Great Britain(Tiller, Schilling, and Morris 1968/Ex. 1-92) and Finland (Seppalainenand Tolonen 1974/Ex. 1-100; Tolonen et al. 1975/Ex. 1-392; Tolonen, Nurminen,and Hernberg 1979/Ex. 1-158). The British cohort was recently followedup by Sweetnam et al. (1987), and the Finnish workers have been followedup by Nurminen and Hernberg (1985). The study by Tiller et al. (1968/Ex. 1-92) of British rayon workers wasthe first to relate exposure to carbon disulfide to the development ofcoronary heart disease. These authors found that, among men employed formore than 10 years in the rayon industry and followed from 1950 to 1964,those exposed to carbon disulfide had death rates from coronary heart diseasemore than twice the rate in other rayon workers. Thus, the Tiller et al.(1968/Ex. 1-92) study demonstrated that 10 years or more of exposure tocarbon disulfide was associated with a significantly elevated risk of coronarydisease. The United Kingdom's threshold limit value for carbon disulfide, whichhad been 20 ppm in the 1960s, was subsequently reduced to 10 ppm in the1970s. To examine the effect of this reduced limit on occupational risk,Sweetnam et al. (1987) conducted a follow-up study on the cohort firstdescribed by Tiller et al. (1968/Ex. 1-92). The health status and causeof death for 2,848 members of this cohort were ascertained up to the endof 1982. Exposure scores representing cumulative exposure to carbon disulfidewere developed for each cohort member, based on an analysis of personaland area sampling results, job category, and time spent in each job category.Sweetnam et al. (1987) found the pattern of mortality similar to that foundby Tiller, Schilling, and Morris (1968/Ex. 1-92): among spinner operators,who had the highest CS<T2>2</T2> exposures of any job category, 73 deaths from ischemic heartdisease (IHD) were identified, compared with 42.5 expected deaths (SMR=172),a finding that was statistically significant. A statistically significanttrend was found between cumulative exposure since first exposure and incidenceof IHD mortality, which indicates a dose-related effect. A second (andperhaps most important) finding of this study was that recent (or current)exposure to carbon disulfide, as well as total cumulative exposure, wereboth risk factors for IHD. The authors established this association byexamining the relationship between IHD mortality risk and each worker'stotal CS<T2>2</T2> exposure in the two years preceding death or the end of thestudy. The third result of this study was that workers with current CS<T2>2</T2> exposure also had significantly higher risk than workers whohad ceased exposure. The dose-related relationship between increased IHDmortality risk and recent exposure to carbon disulfide suggested to theauthors of this study that the effect of carbon disulfide on the cardiovascularsystem was direct and reversible. Thus, the Sweetnam et al. (1987) follow-up determined that there is a relationshipbetween the risk of IHD mortality and increased cumulative exposure toCS<T2>2</T2>. Among workers who terminated exposure, this risk declined tonon-statistically-significant levels after one year of no exposure. However,risk continued to be elevated among workers who continued to be exposedor who had not been exposure-free for a full year. OSHA interprets thefindings of this important study to indicate that cumulative CS<T2>2</T2> dose from time of first exposure is a risk factor for IHD, andthat this elevated risk continues unless exposure is terminated. That is,OSHA finds that workers who have been exposed to CS<T2>2</T2> in the past continue to be at increased risk as long as theyare exposed to CS<T2>2</T2>, even when their recent exposure is to lower levels (approximately10 ppm, the current U.K. TLV). This finding was confirmed by Nurminen and Hernberg (1985) in their follow-upstudy of 343 Finnish rayon workers who had been exposed to carbon disulfidefor at least five years. Health status data were obtained for these workersfor the period 1967 to 1982. In 1972, a preventive program had been institutedthat included establishing a 10-ppm exposure limit and removing workersat high risk of coronary disease from continued exposure to carbon disulfide.Median exposure levels (largely from area samples) for the period 1975to 1980 did not exceed 5 to 6 ppm, and third-quartile exposure levels didnot exceed 10 ppm. These levels were about half those reported for theperiod 1967 to 1975. Nurminen and Hernberg (1985) reported a 4.7-fold increase in IHD mortalityincidence for the period 1967 to 1972, prior to the establishment of theprotective measures described above. Five years after these measures wereinstituted, only 19 percent of the cohort continued to be exposed to carbondisulfide (compared to 53 percent of the cohort exposed in 1972). The relativerisk for the first seven years of follow-up (1967 to 1974) was 3.2, comparedto a relative risk of 1.0 for the last eight years (1974 to 1982). Theexcess risk of IHD mortality thus declined steadily throughout the follow-upperiod; this trend was statistically significant. The authors concludedthat ``* * * the cardiotoxic effects of CS<T2>2</T2> are reversible in the sense that the cessation of, or a radicaldecrease in, exposure reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality to backgroundlevels'' (Nurminen and Hernberg 1985, p. 34). Thus, the Nurminen and Hernberg(1985) study shows that reducing exposure levels below 10 ppm (combined,in their case, with a rigorous medical removal program to terminate exposurefor employees who had developed signs or symptoms of coronary heart disease)can reduce the significant risk of IHD mortality to baseline levels.In addition to NIOSH (Exs. 8-47 and 193), the AFL-CIO (Ex. 194) and Dr.James Melius, Director of the Division of Occupational Health and EnvironmentalEpidemiology of the New York Department of Health (Ex. 152), supportedOSHA's proposed 1-ppm PEL for carbon disulfide. However, several rulemakingparticipants criticized the studies relied on by OSHA, primarily on thegrounds that the cohorts in which excess deaths from cardiovascular diseasehad been seen included workers who, these participants argued, were exposedfor many years to levels of carbon disulfide much higher than the 10- to40-ppm levels generally reported in these studies (Exs. 3-747, 3-1158,8-19, 8-45, 31, 125, and 174; Tr. pp. 4-74 to 4-107). For example, Dr.Ernest Dixon, a toxicology consultant for the Inter-Industry Committeeon Carbon Disulfide, testified as follows on these studies, which werealso relied on by NIOSH to determine NIOSH's recommended standard:<ITAG tagnum="21">The NIOSH document presents a recitation of the toxic reviews, neurotoxiceffects, and the various cardiovascular studies from chiefly Scandinavia,largely epidemiologic studies which attempted to determine whether or notischemic or other cardiovascular abnormalities caused an excess of deathsamong workers exposed to elevated levels of CS<T2>2</T2>. Essentially, all of these were from the viscose manufacturingindustry. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Air sampling for carbon disulfide in the period prior to a decadeago was cumbersome, costly and took a long time for chemical analysis.As cited in numerous other reports, the practices of that period were toobtain area rather than personal samples. Work practices examined in thestudies were such that the area sample results relied upon are believedto have significantly underestimated [both] the actual exposures and [thefact] that there were substantially higher exposures than have existedin more recent years. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Accordingly, many of the workers in such studies had encountered manyyears of greatly higher exposure, especially for the earliest period oftheir exposure (Tr. p. 4-77).</ITAG>In discussing the Tiller, Schilling, and Morris (1968/Ex. 1-92) study,Dr. Dixon emphasized that the coronary mortality risk of viscose productionworkers was not reported in this study to have been elevated, despite thefact that 17 percent of samples taken in production areas exceeded 20 ppm.However, there was a substantial excess in mortality from cardiovasculardisease among spinners, where 50 percent of area samples exceeded 20 ppm(Tr. p. 4-80). In addition, Dr. Dixon pointed out that the populationsstudied by Vigliani (1954/Ex. 1-103) and by Seppalainen and Tolonen (1974/Ex.1-100) were likely to have been exposed during high-viscose-productionperiods at the time of World War II, when exposures were higher than inlater periods. As discussed above, OSHA believes that both cumulative exposure and currentexposure are risk factors for IHD among CS<T2>2</T2>-exposed workers; the Agency has also determined that excessrisk continues for exposed workers as long as exposure continues. As toDr. Dixon's point about area samples, OSHA does not agree that it is possibleto infer that earlier area samples underestimate exposures. It is commonindustrial hygiene practice to measure problem areas in a facility to determinewhere additional control is needed. In addition, there is no way of determining,without actually taking both personal and area samples, whether the resultsof personal sampling would in fact be higher or lower than area samplestaken in the same facility; whether breathing zone samples are higher orlower than area samples depends on a host of factors, including the positioningof the area sample in relation to the source of emissions, the locationof the worker in relation to the same source, and the amount of time theworker spends in the vicinity of the emisssion source. The Inter-Industry Committee on Carbon Disulfide submitted to the recorda recent epidemiologic study by MacMahon and Monson (1988/Ex. 125). Thestudy cohort consisted of 10,418 men employed between 1957 and 1979 inthe four principal U.S. viscose rayon plants. The mortality status of thecohort was ascertained up to mid-1983. Cohort members were placed intogeneral exposure categories according to job title; these categories werehighest, intermediate, variable, least, and none. The authors found nosignificant increase in overall mortality in the 4,448 employees with thehighest potential for CS<T2>2</T2> exposure compared with the mortality among 3,311 employees withno CS<T2>2</T2> exposure. However, there was a statistically significant excessof arteriosclerotic heart disease (ASHD) among the most heavily exposedworkers (242 deaths versus 195.6 expected). No clear relationship was observedbetween exposure duration or latency and excess ASHD mortality; however,the data suggested that the risk was higher among employees exposed toCS<T2>2</T2> for 15 or more years and among employees hired prior to 1960.In addition, MacMahon and Monson (1988/Ex. 125) found a statistically significantincrease in the SMR (SMR=150) for ASHD among members of the cohort whohad been exposed to CS<T2>2</T2> the year immediately preceding the date of death or the terminationdate of the study (Ex. 125, Attachment B, Table 7, p. 702); however, therewas no general pattern of increased SMRs among cohort members whose timesince last exposure exceeded one year. This finding is consistent withthe results of the British studies, which also found an increased riskof heart disease among recently exposed employees but not among employeeswho had left their jobs. The Inter-Industry Committee on Carbon Disulfide interpreted the MacMahonand Monson (1988/Ex. 125) study to mean that U.S. workers employed since1960 were not at risk of ASHD (Tr. 4-96), and NIOSH (Ex. 193, Commentson Carbon Disulfide) noted that the study lacked exposure data. However,OSHA finds the results of the MacMahon and Monson (1988/ Ex. 125) studysupportive and consistent with those of the British and Finnish studiesdiscussed above. First, all of the studies clearly demonstrate a positiveassociation between exposure to carbon disulfide and increased risk ofmortality from heart disease. Second, studies from all three countrieslink the excess risk to cumulative CS<T2>2</T2> exposure. Third, the studies from all three countries demonstratethat significant risk can be substantially reduced or eliminated by reducingor stopping exposure, even after a considerable CS<T2>2</T2> dose has accumulated; both the U.S. and British studies reporta significantly increased risk of death from heart disease among workerswho were recently exposed. However, no increased risk was seen among workerswhose exposures had ended one year or longer prior to death or the endof the study. Moreover, the Finnish study reported steady declines in heartdisease mortality among workers after exposure levels were reduced to below10 ppm and a rigorous medical screening and removal program was instituted.These findings clearly demonstrate that current or continued exposure tocarbon disulfide at the levels presently encountered in these facilitiesis as important a risk factor for heart disease mortality as cumulativeexposure.In addition to evidence that carbon disulfide is a cardiovascular toxin,there is a substantial body of evidence that exposure to carbon disulfidepresents a fetotoxic hazard and that this substance may also be a teratogen.Some of the early (pre-1977) animal data on reproductive effects were reviewedin the NIOSH (1977b/Ex. 1-260) criteria document on carbon disulfide. Inits posthearing submission, NIOSH (Ex. 193) mentions two relevant reports.One by Cai and Bao (1981, as cited in Ex. 193) reported increased incidencesof menstrual disturbances and of pregnancy toxemia, a potentially lethalcondition, in rayon workers. These authors also presented evidence thatCS<T2>2</T2> can cross the placental barrier and be secreted into mothers'milk. The second report cited by NIOSH (Hemminki and Niemi 1982, as citedin Ex. 193) found a significantly elevated incidence of spontaneous abortionsamong women employed in viscose rayon facilities in Finland; however, dataon the specific CS<T2>2</T2> exposure levels were generally lacking.The Rohm and Haas Company submitted a summary (Ex. 10-5) of the evidenceon the reproductive toxicity of carbon disulfide to the OSHA docket; thisinformation shows that carbon disulfide has caused fetal deaths and malformationsin CS<T2>2</T2>-exposed laboratory animals. Rohm and Haas cite a series of abstractsby Tabacova and others in which oral administration of CS<T2>2</T2> to female rats during gestation produced both teratogenic andfetotoxic effects. These effects were magnified in the F<T2>2</T2> offspring of the prenatally exposed F<T2>1</T2> generation, which suggests that CS<T2>2</T2> has a multigenerational effect that continues to cause malformationsin successive generations.Jones-Price et al. (1984, NTIS/PB84-192343) found both maternal and fetaltoxicity in CD rats exposed orally to 200, 400, or 600 mg/kg/d CS<T2>2</T2> during days 6 through 15 of gestation. No dose-related increasesin the incidence of teratogenicity were observed. In another report, Jones-Priceet al. (1984, NTIS/PB84-192350) found significant dose-related increasesin percent resorptions/litter, percent non-live (dead or resorbed)/litter,and percent of fetuses affected (non-live and malformed)/litter among NewZealand White rabbits exposed orally to 25, 75, or 150 mg/kg/d during days6 through 19 of gestation. The percentage of malformed fetuses per litterincreased with dose and was statistically significant at the highest dosetested.In an inhalation study, Hardin, Bond, Sikov et al. (1981/Ex. 1-699) exposedrats and rabbits to 20 or 40 ppm CS<T2>2</T2> for 6.5 hours per day during days 1 through 19 (rats) or 1 through24 (rabbits) of gestation. No embryotoxic or fetotoxic effects were noted,indicating that 40 ppm is a no-effect level for these effects in rats andrabbits. According to the analysis by Rohm and Haas, the lowest-reported-effectlevel (25 mg/kg/d) documented by Jones-Price et al. (1984) for rabbitscorresponds to an equivalent airborne exposure of 58 ppm; this lowest-reported-effectlevel is in close agreement with the no-effect level reported by Hardinet al. (1981/Ex. 1-699) for the same species.OSHA believes that this evidence, which shows that consistent fetotoxicand teratogenic effects are associated with exposure to carbon disulfide,warrants considerable concern. OSHA is particularly alarmed at the multigenerationaleffect of CS<T2>2</T2> exposure that has been demonstrated to occur in rats. This riskof reproductive effects, combined with the previously recognized risk ofcardiovascular disease, have convinced OSHA that a substantial reductionin the PEL for carbon disulfide is clearly justified.Several foreign governments and standards-setting organizations have alreadyestablished 8-hour TWA exposure limits for carbon disulfide that rangefrom 1 to 10 ppm. For example, NIOSH has recommended a 1-ppm TWA limitfor this substance, and Rohm and Haas established an internal limit of4 ppm as an 8-hour TWA (Ex. 10-5). Several foreign countries, includingWest Germany, Italy, Japan, Sweden, and Switzerland, currently have 10-ppmlimits. The ACGIH has established a 10-ppm TLV for CS<T2>2</T2>; however, the ACGIH limit does not consider any of the evidenceof CS<T2>2</T2>'s fetotoxic or teratogenic effects.Based on the evidence in the record and the toxicological literature, OSHAconcludes that 4 ppm is a reasonable and prudent level at which to establisha revised 8-hour TWA PEL for carbon disulfide. This limit should providefor a substantial reduction in the significant risk both of cardiovasculardisease and adverse reproductive effects associated with CS<T2>2</T2> exposures; clearly, these effects constitute material impairmentsof health and functional capacity. In addition, because of the seriousnessof the effects associated with exposure to carbon disulfide, and in accordancewith the policy described in Section VI.C.17 on short-term exposure limits,OSHA finds that a STEL is necessary to ensure that the 8-hour TWA limitis not exceeded during operations characterized by intermittent exposuresto elevated levels of CS<T2>2</T2>. Rohm and Haas (Ex. 10-5) has established an internal guidelineof 12 ppm as a short-term limit to ensure that the 8-hour TWA limit isnot exceeded, and NIOSH also recommends a short-term limit to ensure thatfull-shift exposures are maintained under good control. In the final rule,OSHA is accordingly establishing a 12-ppm STEL to supplement the 4-ppmTWA PEL.OSHA's assessment of the feasibility of this limit indicates that, undernormal operating conditions, a 4-ppm TWA PEL and a 12-ppm STEL are generallyachievable by using engineering and work practice controls; respiratoryprotection may be required during certain operations in rayon and sausage-casingproduction, such as maintenance tasks or opening of the production lines(see Section VII). Specific operations for which OSHA will accept the useof respirators include the following:andbullet; Opening windows and hoods to change spinerettes (in SIC 28);andbullet; Opening windows and hoods to remove filament bundles (in SIC 28);andbullet; Effecting product-line changes (in SIC 28);andbullet; Unloading xanthate from the baratte (in SIC 30);andbullet; Aligning strands in the extrusion cabinet (in SIC 30); andandbullet; Manually puncturing casings at the extrusion nozzles in the cellulosicfood casing industry (in SIC 30).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Thus, OSHA finds that the TWA and STEL limits being established inthe final rule are feasible.<ITAG tagnum="71">CHLOROPENTAFLUOROETHANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 76-15-3; Chemical Formula: CICF<T2>2</T2>CF<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Theproposed PEL for this substance was 1000 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, and NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N1) supported the proposal. The final rule establishesthis limit. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 1000 ppm for this colorless, odorlessgas.Chloropentafluoroethane is an asphyxiant at high concentrations. In dogsand rats, gastrointestinal absorption following intragastric intubationhas been shown to be minimal (Terrill 1974/Ex. 1-1070; Clayton, Hood, Nick,and Waritz 1966/Ex. 1-952). Rats exposed to 800,000 ppm FC-115 with 20percent oxygen for four hours showed no clinical or histopathologic effects(Clayton, Hood, Nick, and Waritz 1966/Ex. 1-952). Rats and guinea pigsshowed no adverse clinical effects at inhalation levels of 600,000 ppmFC-115 in oxygen for two hours (Weigand 1971/Ex. 1-1102), and guinea pigsexposed to 200,000 ppm FC-115 in air for varying intervals up to two hoursalso exhibited no adverse signs (Breen and Wallis 1963, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 133). Rats, mice, rabbits, and dogs have tolerated six-hourdaily exposures of 100,000 ppm FC-115 for 90 days without adverse effects(Clayton, Hood, Nick, and Waritz 1966/Ex. 1-952), and laboratory animalshave tolerated doses of 200,000 ppm for 3.5 hours daily, five days perweek, for four weeks (Weigand 1971/Ex. 1-1102). FC-115's potential forcardiac sensitization caused one of 13 unanesthetized dogs to develop cardiacsensitization after exposure to 150,000 ppm intravenously (Trochimowicz,Azar, Terrill, and Mullin 1974/Ex. 1-448). Several other studies indicatethat unanesthetized dogs, rats, and monkeys receiving dosages of between100,000 ppm and 200,000 ppm may show increased blood pressure, acceleratedheart rate, myocardial depression, or altered pulmonary effects under certainconditions (Belej and Aviado 1975/Ex. 1-462; Friedman, Cammarato, and Aviado1973/Ex. 1-416; Aviado and Belej 1975/Ex. 1-616). There were no reportsof mutagenic, teratogenic, or carcinogenic toxicities in these studies.The Agency received no comments addressing chloropentafluoroethane, otherthan those submitted by NIOSH. OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA permissible exposure limit of 1000 ppmfor chloropentafluoroethane. The Agency concludes that this limit willprotect workers from the significant risk of cardiac effects, which constitutesmaterial impairment of health and functional capacity, at the high levelsformerly permitted by the absence of an OSHA limit. <ITAG tagnum="71">ETHYLENE GLYCOL DINITRATE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 628-96-6; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>NO<T2>3</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>NO<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

No. 1290</ITAG>The former OSHA PELs for ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN) and nitroglycerin(NG) were ceilings of 1 mg/m3 with skin notations. The proposed PELs forthese substances were 20-minute STELs of 0.1 mg/m3, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47,Table N1) supported the proposal (which was based on NIOSH's recommendedlimits). The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) has established a TLV-TWA of 0.05 ppm(0.3 mg/m3) for EGDN and a TLV-TWA of 0.05 ppm (0.5 mg/m3) for NG, bothwith skin notations. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing 15-minuteSTELs of 0.1 mg/m3 for EGDN and NG and retaining the skin notations forthese substances. EGDN is a yellowish, oily, explosive liquid, and NG isa pale yellow, viscous liquid. Most occupational exposures to EGDN actually involve mixtures of EGDN andNG. Because EGDN is 160 times more volatile than nitroglycerin and mostof the mixtures of these two substances used in industry consist of 60to 80 percent EGDN, the adverse effects associated with the inhalationof the vapors from such mixtures can be attributed primarily to EGDN. Trainor and Jones (1966/Ex. 1-107) reported that exposure to EGDN:NG ata level of 0.7 mg/m3 for 25 minutes was sufficient to produce decreasedblood pressure and a slight headache in humans. These authors also reportedthat workers at a munitions plant developed headaches when exposed to EGDN:NGconcentrations between 0.1 and 0.53 mg/m3 (0.36 mg/m3 average). Morikawa,Muraki, Ikoma et al. (1967/Ex. 1-55) found that workers in an explosivesplant exposed to low concentrations of EGDN:NG (0.066 ppm (approximately0.5 mg/m3) was the highest average level) had a much higher incidence ofabnormal pulse waves than did controls (143 out of 1,271 versus 0 out of175). Abnormal pulse waves often indicate a clinically significant defectin the functioning of the heart and/or circulatory system (Braunwald 1978/Ex.1-1001). In its criteria document for NG and EGDN, NIOSH (1978h/Ex. 1-234) refersto a report of a dynamite worker who died when exposed to EGDN:NG concentrationsbetween 0.3 and 1.4 mg/m3, as well as to another report of two workerswho died suddenly following exposure to EGDN:NG at concentrations rangingfrom 1.7 to 2.7 mg/m3. NIOSH (1978h/Ex. 1-234) observed that skin absorptionmay have contributed significantly to the exposures causing these deaths.OSHA received several comments on EGDN and NG (Exs. 3-661, 8-66, 121, 190,and 154). These commenters raised two issues: the technological and economicfeasibility of the proposed limits, and the strength of the evidence andsignificance of the adverse effects associated with exposure to EGDN andNG. In regard to the issue of technological and economic feasibility, whichwas raised by ICI Americas, Inc. (Ex. 154) and the Institute of Makersof Explosives (IME) (Ex. 121), OSHA has reviewed the record and has concludedthat explosive manufacturers will be able to meet these limits througha combination of equipment improvements and respiratory protection. OSHAbelieves that, if compliance cannot be achieved via engineering controlsand/or process improvements, air-supplied respirators with quick-releasecouplings could be used to achieve the final rule's limits. The Agency'sreasoning is discussed in detail in the Technological Feasibility sectionof the preamble (Section VII). On the second point addressed by commenters, the meaning of the healtheffects observed to occur in connection with exposure to EGDN:NG, the IMEstates that:<ITAG tagnum="21">[T]he NIOSH Criteria Document relied upon in the . . .

The Agency believes that such headaches impair performance,cause pain and suffering, affect the safety of the victim and his or herco-workers, and contribute to absenteeism. In the case of EGDN:NG-inducedheadaches, however, headaches have a greater meaning: they are an earlywarning of vasodilation, an indicator of systemic toxicity. OSHA also findsthe report of an EGDN:NG-induced death in an explosives manufacturing facilityboth convincing and troubling. The Agency continues to be persuaded bythe evidence in the Trainor and Jones (1966/Ex. 1-107) study, the NIOSHcriteria document (1978h/Ex. 1-234), and the Morikawa, Muraki, Ikoma etal. (1967/Ex. 1-55) study that the health effects associated with exposureto very low levels of EGDN:NG (i.e., in the range of 0.1 to 1.4 mg/m3)are acute, may occur after brief exposures, and have been shown to be lethal.According to NIOSH (Ex. 150, Comments on EGDN:NG), the 15-minute 0.1-mg/m3limits being established in the final rule will protect against ``anginapectoris, other signs and symptoms of cardiac ischemia or heart damage,and against sudden death . . . since all of these . . . seem to be relatedto compensatory vasoconstriction induced by repeated exposure to NG orEGDN'' (Ex. 150). NIOSH also reports that a preliminary study of mortalityresulting from heart disease and other causes among NG workers by Reeve,Bloom, Rinsky, and Smith (1983a and 1983b, as cited in Ex. 150) suggestsan association between NG exposure and cardiovascular disease mortality;at the facilities where this increase in cardiovascular disease occurred,exposures were being maintained near or below 0.02 ppm (0.2 mg/m3) (Ex.150).Hypotension and headache have been observed in populations exposed to EGDN:NGat levels below 0.5 mg/m3 for brief periods (25 minutes), and fatalitieshave occurred after EGDN:NG exposures at concentrations between 0.3 and1.4 mg/m3, in one instance, and between 1.7 and 2.7 mg/m3, in another.OSHA's former standard was 1.0 mg/m3; since worker deaths have occurredat or near this level, OSHA is establishing short-term limits for EGDNand NG of 0.1 mg/m3 and retaining the skin notations for these substancesin the final rule. OSHA concludes that these limits are necessary to preventfatalities and to protect against the significant risks of vasodilationand cardiac effects associated with exposures to EGDN:NG in the workplace.The Agency has determined that the cardiovascular effects caused by EGDN:NGrepresent material impairments of health. Because EGDN:NG is readily absorbedthrough the skin and can produce systemic effects by this exposure route(Tr. pp. 9-149 to 9-150), OSHA is retaining the skin notations for bothsubstances. <ITAG tagnum="71">FLUOROTRICHLOROMETHANE (TRICHLOROFLUOROMETHANE) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-69-4; Chemical Formula: CC1<T2>3</T2>F </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The formerOSHA PEL was an 8-hour TWA of 1000 ppm. The proposed PEL was a ceilingof 1000 ppm and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) supported the proposal. Thefinal rule establishes this limit. At ordinary temperatures, FC-11 is anoncombustible, colorless liquid or gas. Inhalation of large doses of FC-11 has caused cardiac sensitization anddeath in humans. Experimental mice that inhaled aerosol containing 10 percentFC-11 exhibited cardiac arrhythmias. In the same study, dogs that inhaledaerosol containing 2.5 percent FC-11 had decreased myocardial function;monkeys that inhaled an aerosol containing 5 percent FC-11 developed tachycardiaand hypotension (<T3>Drinking Water and Health, </T3>National Research Council 1977). Exposure to 5000 ppm FC-11 has induced cardiac sensitization and arrhythmiain dogs that were intravenously injected with epinephrine (Reinhardt, Azar,Maxfield, Smith, and Mullin 1971/Ex. 1-78). Jenkins, Jones, Coon, and Siegel(1970/Ex. 1-95) found that four species of animals (monkeys, dogs, rats,and guinea pigs) suffered no ill effects after 90 days of continuous exposureto 1000 ppm of FC-11. Other than those submitted by NIOSH, OSHA receivedno comments on FC-11. The cardiac sensitization exhibited by FC-11-exposed animals is an acuteeffect. OSHA's former 1000-ppm TWA PEL would permit workers to be exposedto short-term concentrations of FC-11 that are sufficiently high to sensitizethe heart to sympathomimetic amines; OSHA considers this effect to be amaterial impairment of health. Accordingly, OSHA concludes that, at theformer limit, workers are at significant risk of experiencing arrhythmia.Revising this limit to a 1000-ppm ceiling limit will substantially reducethis significant risk of cardiac sensitization. <ITAG tagnum="71">SODIUM AZIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 26628-22-8; Chemical Formula: NaN<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1364</ITAG>There was no former OSHA PEL for sodium azide. The proposed PELs were aceiling of 0.1 ppm as hydrazoic acid vapor (HN<T2>3</T2>) and a ceiling of 0.3 mg/m3 as sodium azide (NaN<T2>3</T2>); NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table Nl) concurred with the Agency's selection.The final rule establishes this limit. In addition, a skin notation isbeing added to the limit in the final rule. The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) hasceiling limits for sodium azide of 0.1 ppm (as hydrazoic acid vapor) and0.3 mg/m3 (as NaN<T2>3</T2>). Sodium azide is a colorless, crystalline solid. Sodium azide is known to produce hypotension in laboratory animals andhumans. An intravenous dose of 1 mg/kg was reported to lower blood pressurein cats (Graham 1949/Ex. 1-109). In the 1950s, the medicinal usefulnessof sodium azide as a hypotensive agent was tested in 30 hypertensive patients.Their hypertension was reduced, but observed side effects included headaches;in addition, 20 of 30 patients developed increased sensitivity to sodiumazide, necessitating a reduction in the dose (Black, Zweifach, and Speer1954/Ex. 1-163). Hicks (1950, cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 533) reportedthat repeated intraperitoneal injections of 5 to 10 mg/kg in rats causeddemyelination of nerve fibers of the CNS. Alben and Fager (1972, citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 533) showed that sodium azide formed strong complexeswith hemoglobin and blocked oxygen transport in the blood. Acute inhalation by humans of hydrazoic acid vapor (which forms when sodiumazide contacts water) results in lowered blood pressure, eye irritation,bronchitis, headache, weakness, and collapse (Fairhall et al. 1943/Ex.1-130; Graham 1949/Ex. 1-109). The exposure levels that produce these effectswere not reported by these authors. Haas and Marsh (1970/Ex. 1-121) reportedthat exposure to concentrations of hydrazoic acid vapor as low as 0.5 ppm``cause[d] some discomfort to laboratory personnel.'' Dr. Hecker of AbbottLaboratories (Ex. 3-678) commented that the limit for sodium azide shouldinclude a skin notation, and Sax and Lewis (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>7th ed., 1989) reportthe dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits to be 20 mg/kg, demonstrating that sodium azidereadily penetrates the skin and causes systemic poisoning. Grace Ziem,an independent occupational physician, also supported a skin notation forsodium azide (Ex. 46). In the final rule, OSHA is therefore adding a skinnotation for sodium azide. Because of its hypotensive effect in humans, OSHA concludes that ceilinglimits of 0.1 ppm (as HN<T2>3</T2>) and 0.3 mg/m3 (as NaN<T2>3</T2>) should be established for sodium azide to reduce the significantrisk of cardiovascular and irritation effects posed to workers at the levelsformerly permitted by the absence of an OSHA limit. The Agency considersthe effects associated with exposure to sodium azide as material impairmentsof health. To reduce this significant risk substantially, OSHA is establishingthese ceiling limits for sodium azide in the final rule. In addition, OSHAis adding a skin notation to the PEL to alert employers to the fact thatsodium azide readily penetrates intact skin and that dermal exposure cancontribute significantly to overall worker exposure. <ITAG tagnum="71">1,1,2-TRICHLORO-1,2,2-TRIFLUOROETHANE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 76-13-1; Chemical Formula: CC1<T2>2</T2>FCC1F<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1403</ITAG>1,1,2-Trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane (FC-113) is a member of the chlorofluorocarbonfamily. The former OSHA PEL was an 8-hour TWA of 1000 ppm. The Agency proposedto retain this limit and to add a STEL, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1)concurred that these limits are appropriate. The final rule retains the8-hour TWA of 1000 ppm and supplements it with a 1250-ppm STEL. The ACGIHhas an 8-hour TLV-TWA of 1000 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 1250 ppm forFC-113. FC-113 is a colorless, noncombustible liquid.Cardiac sensitization following the administration of epinephrine is themost significant effect observed after exposure to FC-113. Reinhardt, Mullin,and Maxfield (1973/Ex. 1-114) observed that 10 out of 29 dogs exposed to5000 ppm FC-113 for 5 minutes and simultaneously injected with epinephrinedeveloped serious arrhythmias. Similar experiments, in which the dogs wereexposed to 2000 to 2500 ppm of this substance for longer periods of time(from 30 minutes to 6 hours) and simultaneously administered epinephrine,resulted occasionally in arrhythmia (Aviado 1975, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 603). However, when the experiment was repeated using four 6-hourexposures to 1000 ppm in conjunction with an injection of epinephrine,no arrhythmias were observed. A study by Stopps and McLaughlin (1967/Ex. 1-122) of human volunteers revealedthat exposure to 2500 ppm FC-113 for 1.5 hours resulted in impairment ofpsychomotor performance (described as lethargy and inability to concentrate).This effect was not observed at concentrations below 2500 ppm. Within thefirst one-half to one hour of exposure to 2500 ppm or more, subjects reportedsubjective sensations including loss of concentration, a tendency to somnolence,and a feeling of ``heaviness'' in the head. Dr. Lawrence Hecker of AbbottLaboratories (Ex. 3-678) commented that there was no basis for a STEL forFC-113. OSHA does not agree with Dr. Hecker's assessment because the resultsof the Stopps and McLaughlin (1967/Ex. 1-122) study described above demonstratethat FC-113 can induce subjective effects in humans on short-term exposure.Thus, OSHA finds that a STEL is necessary to prevent these effects. TheUAW (Tr. pp. 7-67 to 7-69) and the AFL-CIO (Ex. 194) supported short-termor ceiling limits for FC-113 lower than the proposed STEL. The evidence described above demonstrates that FC-113 can exert toxic effectsat levels of exposure comparable to the levels that were formerly permittedby excursions above the former OSHA TWA limit of 1000 ppm; such levelsthus pose a significant risk of cardiac sensitization to exposed workers.The Agency considers cardiac sensitization induced by FC-113 as materialimpairment of health and functional capacity. OSHA concludes that a STELof 1250 ppm will provide a wider margin of safety against cardiac sensitizationand will reduce the risk of impaired psychomotor performance by limitingthe potentially high, short-term exposures formerly permitted by the 8-hourTWA limit alone. The final rule establishes limits of 1000 ppm TWA and1250 ppm STEL for 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2- trifluoroethane to substantiallyreduce the significant risks associated with exposure to this substance.Conclusions Of all the physiological systems, the cardiovascular system is especiallyvulnerable to occupational hazards because cardiovascular diseases arealready so prevalent in our society. According to Levy (1985/Ex. 1-210),``an estimated 40 million Americans have some form of cardiovascular disease.''The major risk factors, as revealed by epidemiology, are age, male sex,hypertension, cigarette smoking, the existence of low-density and high-densityplasma lipoproteins, cholesterol, and diabetes (Levy 1985/Ex. 1-210). ManyAmerican workers exposed to the chemicals grouped on the basis of theircardiovascular effects have one or more of these risk factors and are thereforeparticularly susceptible to exposure to cardiovascular toxicants. Althoughthe precise interactions among these risk factors and exposures to cardiovasculartoxins are difficult to demonstrate with accuracy, few would argue thatthey do not occur. OSHA concludes that the potential for cardiovascular system damage associatedwith exposure to these cardiac sensitizers, vasodilators, and atherosclerosis-causingsubstances poses a significant risk to employees in a broad range of workplaces.The effects experienced by exposed workers include arrhythmia, low bloodpressure, stroke, and blockage of the flow of blood to the myocardium.OSHA has demonstrated that these effects clearly constitute material impairmentof health and functional capacity. Revising or establishing exposure limitsfor these cardiovascular toxins will substantially reduce these significantrisks. <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of SystemicToxicity </ITAG>Introduction For a number of substances, OSHA's revised limits are based primarily onevidence that exposure is associated with general systemic toxicity. Thisgroup of substances is unique among the groupings discussed in this preamblein that no single organ system can be identified as the target of low-doseexposure to these chemicals. Instead, these substances have been showneither to affect several organ systems simultaneously or to cause a varietyof nonspecific adverse signs and symptoms that are indicative of generaltoxicity. The 34 substances belonging to this group and their CAS numbers, HS numbers,and former, proposed, and final rule PELs are shown in Table C8-1. OSHAis establishing exposure limits for 17 substances in this group that werenot formerly regulated and retaining the former PELs for eight substancesto which STELs are being added. For six substances, OSHA is lowering itsformer 8-hour TWA PELs. For two substances that formerly had 8-hour TWAPELs, OSHA is deleting the full shift limit and replacing it with a short-termlimit or a ceiling. For one substance, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWAin place of a former ceiling limit.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M004</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 835-838</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Description of the Health Effects For each substance included in this grouping, limits have been establishedto protect against a variety of adverse exposure-related effects that aremanifested at multiple target organ sites. In some instances, the natureof the toxic effects associated with exposure is well-defined and clearlyunderstood (for example, CNS depression, histological organ changes, embryo-toxicity,methemoglobinemia, conjunctivitis, liver and kidney damage, testiculardamage). The effects of exposure to other substances in this group, however,have been demonstrated only by such nonspecific indicators as dizziness,respiratory irritation, hematuria, chest tightness, weight loss or decreasedrate of weight gain, lethargy, loss of appetite, nervousness, or gastrointestinaldisturbances. Although the specificity of the systemic effect caused byexposure to the substances in this group may vary, all of these substanceshave been shown to be biologically active in mammalian species, to interferesignificantly with biological processes, and to impair normal organ function.Table C8-2 summarizes the toxic effects reported in humans and experimentalanimals that support the establishment of limits for these substances.This table shows the variety of adverse health effects that adoption ofthe final rule's limits will minimize or prevent. The table also showsthat, for the vast majority of substances in this group, the risks of exposurehave been defined in studies of humans or animals and are known to includerespiratory effects, neurological effects, adverse effects on the reproductivesystem, organ damage, hematopoietic effects, sensitization, and mucosalirritation. All of these effects are indicative of generalized systemiceffects rather than localized effects occurring at the site of chemicalcontact.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M006</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="41">Insert illustration(s) 0840-845</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>Dose-Response Relationships and Systemic Effects As Table C8-2 shows, adverse toxic reactions have been reported to occurin humans for 19 of the 34 substances in this group; thus, for more thanhalf of these substances, it has been established conclusively that exposureis associated with adverse health effects in humans. Experimental animaldata comprise the principal evidence for the toxicologic action of theremaining substances. As is the case for many substances for which limitsare being established, apparent no-observed-effect levels, supplementedby the use of appropriate margins of protection, provide the basis forsetting limits. The systemic effects caused by exposure to substances inthis group appear to follow an NOE dose-response pattern. That is, as intensityand/or duration of exposure decreases, the severity of the effect on organsystems also decreases until a point is reached (the NOE level) where thereis no detectable effect, at least at observable levels, on organ systems.No-effect exposure levels have been identified in humans and animals forseveral of the substances in this group; where no-effect levels have beenidentified (i.e., for diglycidyl ether and phenylphosphine), they haveprovided the primary basis for the new limits. In instances where no-effect levels have not been reported (e.g., for n-butylglycidyl ether, trimethylbenzene, and acetylsalicylic acid), OSHA has usedsafety factors and expert judgment to derive an NOE value. The following discussions describe the record evidence and OSHA's findingsfor these systemic toxicants and present a summary of the material impairmentsof health associated with exposure to these substances. <ITAG tagnum="71">ACETONITRILE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-05-8; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CN </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1005</ITAG>Acetonitrile is most widely used in industry as a specialty solvent andchemical intermediate. OSHA's former occupational exposure limit for acetonitrilewas a 40-ppm 8-hour TWA. The ACGIH has a 40-ppm TLV-TWA with a 60-ppm TLV-STEL,in addition to a skin notation. OSHA proposed to reduce the former 8-hourTWA PEL to 20 ppm with a skin notation; this was the NIOSH REL, and NIOSHconcurred with the proposed limit (Ex. 8-47, Table Nl). However, aftera thorough evaluation of the record evidence, OSHA has concluded that theACGIH limits for this substance will provide appropriate protection againstacetonitrile's systemic toxicity. Accordingly, the final rule establishesan 8-hour TWA of 40 ppm and a STEL of 60 ppm, without a skin notation,for acetonitrile. In animal studies, acetonitrile has been found to be embryotoxic and teratogenicin rodents exposed to levels sufficiently high to cause maternal toxicity(Berteau, Levinskas, and Rodwell 1982/Ex. 1-179; Willhite 1983/ Ex. 1-43).A 13-week inhalation study conducted by the National Toxicology Program(Hazleton Laboratories, Inc. 1983, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 8)found pathological changes in the liver and some blood changes in miceand rats exposed to concentrations of 400 ppm acetonitrile. The human evidence describing the toxic effects associated with exposureto acetonitrile consists of a report by Pozzani, Carpenter, Palm et al.(1959/Ex. 1-106), who exposed human subjects to acetonitrile vapor, anda case report by Amdur (1959/Ex. 1-143), who described a poisoning incidentinvolving acetonitrile. None of three subjects exposed to 40 ppm for fourhours reported any adverse responses during the exposure period, but onesubject experienced tightness of the chest a few hours after terminationof exposure, as well as a cooling sensation in the lungs the followingday. None of the subjects had elevated blood cyanide levels; one subjectshowed a slightly elevated urinary thiocyanate level. Pozzani et al. (1959/Ex.1-106) also exposed two subjects to 80 ppm and 160 ppm of acetonitrilefor four hours. When exposed to 80 ppm, subjects reported no adverse response;however, at 160 ppm, one subject experienced slight flushing of the faceand chest tightness a few hours after exposure (Pozzani, Carpenter, Palmet al. 1959/Ex. 1-106). In addition to the Pozzani et al. (1959/Ex. 1-106) study, NIOSH (1978g/Ex.1-262) cites a report by Amdur (1959/Ex. 1-143), who investigated an incidentin which 16 painters became ill (with one death) after using an acetonitrile-containingmaterial in a confined space. Amdur (1959/Ex. 1-143) reported no furtherincidents after adequate ventilation was installed and acetonitrile levelswere maintained at about 17 ppm. NIOSH concluded that exposure to 40 ppmmay have produced minimal effects and that no observable effects were producedat 17 ppm (NIOSH 1978g/Ex. 1-262, p. 97). Therefore, NIOSH recommendedthat exposure not exceed 20 ppm as a 10-hour TWA. Other than the commentby NIOSH (Ex. 8-47), no comments were received on this substance. OSHA has carefully reevaluated the evidence of acetonitrile's toxicityto determine the appropriate permissible exposure limits to establish inthe final rule. The Agency concludes that the evidence in humans suggeststhat no adverse effects are experienced at long-term exposures of 40 ppmand that a short-term limit of 60 ppm will provide protection against thefacial flushing and chest tightness experienced by workers exposed forseveral hours to levels above these concentrations. In addition, in accordancewith the policy on skin notations enunciated in Section VI.C.18, OSHA isnot including a skin notation for acetonitrile in the final rule (the dermalLD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 1250 mg/kg). In the final rule, OSHA is therefore retaining its existing 8-hour TWAfor acetonitrile and adding a STEL of 60 ppm to protect against this substance'ssystemic effects. The Agency concludes that these limits will prevent thesignificant risk of acute illness (and, in one case, death) observed inworkers exposed to excessive short-term exposures of acetonitrile; theAgency finds that these health effects clearly constitute material impairmentsof health. In the proposal, OSHA specifically requested information onthe feasibility of achieving the proposed limit; no comments were received,and OSHA accordingly assumes that the final rule's limits, which are higherthan the limit proposed, are feasible. <ITAG tagnum="71">ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (ASPIRIN) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 50-78-2; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>COOC<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>COOH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1006</ITAG>There was no former OSHA exposure limit for acetylsalicylic acid. The ACGIHhas a TLV of 5 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA. The proposed PEL was 5 mg/m3 asan 8-hour TWA. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table Nl) concurs with this limit, andthis is the limit established by the final rule. Acetylsalicylic acid isa white crystal or powder that is essentially odorless and has a slightlybitter taste. The work of O'Brien (1968/Ex. 1-47) reports that a normal therapeutic doseof 600 mg aspirin will interfere with platelet aggregation in subjectsexposed for a period of five days or more. Hart (1947/Ex. 1-137) also reportedthat 150 mg is the smallest oral dose of acetylsalicylic acid that willproduce this effect. Unpublished data from the Dow Chemical Company (citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 10) indicate that aspirin concentrations exceeding100 mg/m3 are tolerated except for occasional skin irritation. However,no data are available on the long-term effects on organ systems of inhalationexposure to aspirin. Secondary sources report that aspirin is an acuteirritant to the gastric mucosa and respiratory tract. No comments otherthan that by NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) were received on this substance. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 5 mg/m3 for acetylsalicylicacid. The Agency concludes that this reduced limit will protect workersfrom experiencing the adverse blood effects and gastric and respiratoryirritation, which constitute material impairments of health that are potentiallyassociated with exposure to this substance at the previously uncontrolledlevels. <ITAG tagnum="71">ALUMINUM (WELDING FUMES) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7429-90-5; Chemical Formula: A1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1019</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no permissible exposure limit for aluminum welding fumes.The proposed PEL was 5 mg/m3, which is consistent with the ACGIH limit.The final rule promulgates an 8-hour TWA for aluminum welding fumes of5 mg/m3, measured as aluminum. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs withthis limit. OSHA received two comments pertaining to aluminum welding fumes. The firstcommenter (Ex. L3-1330) sought clarification as to whether the term ``aluminumwelding fumes'' refers to aluminum fumes or to the gases and fumes usuallyassociated with aluminum welding, such as ozone, nitrous gases, carbonmonoxide, and carbon dioxide. The second commenter, the Specialty SteelIndustry of the United States (Ex. 3-829), objected to the establishmentof a permissible exposure limit for aluminum welding fumes because, inthis commenter's opinion, no scientific evidence was cited in the proposalto indicate that exposure resulted in deleterious effects (Ex. 3-829, p.6). The PEL addresses the aluminum fume that is released in the welding process;this limit is being established to keep the total aluminum particulateconcentrations low enough to prevent aluminum particle accumulation inthe lungs. However, to the extent either that other toxic substances ormaterials are released in the welding process or that conditions are conduciveto the formation of toxic gases, employers must pay attention to the permissibleexposure limits for these substances as well. For example, in AppendixB of the 1987-88 <T3>Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices </T3>(ACGIH1987/Ex. 1-16), the ACGIH states that ``reactive metals and alloys suchas aluminum and titanium are arc-welded in a protective, inert atmospheresuch as argon. These arcs create relatively little fume, but an intenseradiation which can produce ozone'' (ACGIH 1987/Ex. 1-16, Appendix B, p.42). In such an instance, employers would be required to meet the ozonelimits established in this rulemaking (0.1 ppm TWA and 0.3 ppm STEL) aswell as the PEL for aluminum welding fumes.The ACGIH states that ``most welding, even with primitive ventilation,does not produce exposures inside the welding helmet above 5 mg/m3. Thatwhich does * * * should be controlled'' (ACGIH 1987/Ex. 1-16, AppendixB, p. 43). In those rare instances where internal helmet exposures do exceed5 mg/m3, employees are at risk from the irritant effects of hot metal fumes,which enter the lung deeply and accumulate. Because workers exposed to arc welding fumes have previously not been protectedby a permissible exposure limit, OSHA is establishing a PEL of 5 mg/m3TWA for these fumes (measured in the breathing zone of the welder); thedetails of the appropriate positioning of the sampler should be determinedon the basis of guidance in the <T3>Field Operations Manual </T3>(OSHA 1984). This is consistent with apast OSH Review Commission decision (8 OSHRC 1049). The Agency concludesthat this limit will protect welders and other workers in the vicinityof the welding from experiencing the significant irritation potentiallyassociated with inhalation of these fumes; OSHA finds the respiratory irritationcaused by exposure to these fumes constitutes a material health impairment.<ITAG tagnum="71">2-BUTOXYETHANOL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 111-76-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>4</T2>H<T2>9</T2>OCH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>OH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1046</ITAG>OSHA's former permissible exposure limit for 2-butoxyethanol, one of thefamily of substances known as the glycol ethers, was 50 ppm as an 8-hourTWA, with a skin notation. The ACGIH has a limit of 25 ppm TWA, also witha skin notation, for this colorless liquid with a mild ether odor. Theproposed PEL was 25 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, and this limit is establishedby the final rule. The skin notation is retained. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) concurs with the 25-ppm limit for 2-butoxyethanol. 2-Butoxyethanol has long been known to be toxic, with early studies indicatingthat a single seven-hour exposure to 700 ppm was lethal to laboratory animals(Werner, Mitchell, Miller, and von Oettingen 1943a, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 71). Exposures near the lethal level caused systemic toxicity inthe form of hemoglobinuria and lung, kidney, and liver changes. Carpenter,Pozzani, Weil, and associates (1956/Ex. 1-303) reported hemolytic anemiaand increased fragility of the red blood cells in rats repeatedly exposedto 2-butoxyethanol at 320 ppm for five weeks. However, repeated exposurefor 12 weeks at 400 ppm was only slightly injurious to dogs (Werner, Mitchell,Miller, and von Oettingen 1943b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 71).Humans appear to be less susceptible to butoxyethanol poisoning than experimentalanimals. In humans, several single 8-hour exposures at levels of 200 ppmand 100 ppm caused urinary excretion of butoxyacetic acid; these subjectsexperienced irritation and discomfort after these exposures (Carpenter,Pozzani, Weil et al. 1956/Ex. 1-303). A recent study has confirmed thatthe increased erythrocyte osmotic fragility observed in rats exposed tomany of the glycol ethers is a very sensitive indicator of toxicity andcorrelates with the development of hemoglobinuria at higher exposure levels(Moffett, Linnett, and Blair 1976, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 71).These findings indicate that the no-effect level in animals is approximately25 ppm. The ACGIH suggests that 2-butoxyethanol's toxicity may be morelikely to occur as a result of skin absorption than as a consequence ofinhalation (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 71). The Independent Lubricant Manufacturers (Ex. 3-830) objected to the establishmentof a PEL for 2-butoxyethanol on the basis of a 25-ppm no-effect level inanimals, particularly when the evidence suggests that humans may be lesssusceptible than animals to the effects of this substance (Ex. 3-830, p.5). In response to this comment, OSHA notes that <T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology </T3>(3rd rev. ed., Claytonand Clayton 1982) states that ``the lowest concentration of ethylene glycolbutyl ether vapor considered to be unpleasant and therefore disagreeablewas 40 ppm'' (Vol. 2C, p. 3939). This level is below OSHA's former PELof 50 ppm, and the Agency thus believes that its former standard for 2-butoxyethanolwas too high. OSHA concludes that the former PEL of 50 ppm was insufficiently protectiveagainst the risk of 2-butoxyethanol's irritant, hematological, and otherpotential systemic effects, which constitute material health impairments.The limit of 25 ppm included in the final rule will reduce this significantrisk to a level below that at which these toxic effects have been observedin animals and humans. This lower limit will also prevent the discomfortexperienced by workers at exposure levels of 40 ppm. The skin notationis retained because of 2-butoxyethanol's ability to be absorbed dermallyin toxic quantities (2-butoxyethanol's dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 490 mg/kg [RTECS 1988]). <ITAG tagnum="71">n-BUTYL GLYCIDYL ETHER </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 2426-08-6; Chemical Formula: C<T2>4</T2>H<T2>9</T2>OCH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>OH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1052</ITAG>The former OSHA limit for n-butyl glycidyl ether was 50 ppm as an 8-hourTWA. The ACGIH-recommended TLV is 25 ppm; NIOSH has recommended that occupationalexposure to n-butyl glycidyl ether not exceed 5.6 ppm as a 15-minute short-termlevel. The proposed PEL was 25 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, and the final rulepromulgates this limit. n-Butyl glycidyl ether is a clear, colorless liquid.OSHA's former PEL of 50 ppm, which was adopted from the ACGIH's 1968 TLVlist, was based on a Dow Chemical Company report (cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3) that showed that repeated applications of n-butyl glycidyl ether tothe skin of humans caused irritation and sensitization; at the time, theACGIH concluded that a limit of 50 ppm would prevent these irritant responses.Subsequently, the ACGIH reduced the TLV to 25 ppm, noting that the 50-ppmlimit was only 13 times lower than the 8-hour LC<T2>50</T2> (670 ppm) reported for this chemical in rats, and that a widermargin of protection was desirable. The NIOSH limit of 5.6 ppm was recommended in the Institute's June 1978criteria document on glycidyl ethers (NIOSH 1978d/Ex. 1-232). This limitwas based, in large part, on mutagenic studies conducted in microbial andmammalian test systems, as well as on some evidence for other members ofthe glycidyl ether family showing that exposure is associated with testicularatrophy and hematopoietic abnormalities in laboratory animals. After publicationof its Criteria Document, NIOSH received a confidential report preparedfor the Shell Development Company by Anderson et al. (1957, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 81), who had conducted a rat inhalation study. Inthis research, rats were exposed to 38 ppm, 75 ppm, 150 ppm, or 300 ppmn-butyl glycidyl ether for seven hours daily, five days per week for 10weeks. Atrophic testes were found in 5 of 10 rats exposed to 300 ppm, verysmall testes were found in 1 of 10 rats exposed to 150 ppm, and patchyatrophy was found in the testes of 1 of 10 rats exposed to 75 ppm. No effectswere observed in rats exposed at 38 ppm. Based on this additional evidence,NIOSH reaffirmed its REL for n-butyl glycidyl ether in a current intelligencebulletin (NIOSH 1978p, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 81). The Workers Institute for Safety and Health (WISH) and the AFL-CIO submittedposthearing comments on n-butyl glycidyl ether (Exs. 116, 194). These commentersopposed OSHA's proposal to adopt the ACGIH TLV for this substance on thebasis of the reproductive study published in a NIOSH CIB (discussed above)which shows testicular atrophy in exposed laboratory animals. Accordingto WISH:<ITAG tagnum="21">OSHA's review of this substance in the proposal attempts to statethat the 25 ppm ACGIH level is protective against these reproductive effectsbecause a no-effect level of 38 ppm was observed (Ex. 116).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">WISH found this conclusion unjustifiable because of the short exposureperiod (10 weeks) used in the study establishing the NOEL for reproductiveeffects and because considerable uncertainty always surrounds no-effect-levelstudies. In addition, WISH pointed out that ``fertility in rats is lesssensitive to certain testicular effects than human fertility'' and, therefore,that this animal is not the best predictor of human reproductive effects(Ex. 116). In response to these comments, OSHA wishes to clarify that theAgency did not intend to imply in the proposal that the 25-ppm limit wouldprotect against <T3>all </T3>risk of possible reproductive effects. In fact, the proposalmerely noted that 25 ppm was below the no-effect level for reproductiveeffects in rats. The Agency agrees with WISH that the use of a longer exposureperiod in the Anderson et al. (1957, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.81) reproductive study might have established a lower NOEL. However, based on the existing evidence for reproductive effects linkedto n-butyl glycidyl ether exposure, OSHA concludes that reducing the PELfrom 50 ppm to 25 ppm will substantially reduce the significant risk ofthese reproductive effects and will also protect workers against the irritationand sensitization effects, all of which constitute material health impairmentcaused by exposure to this chemical. The Agency notes that NIOSH's RELof 5.6 ppm (15-minute STEL) is based on the result of <T3>in vitro </T3>testing in both microbial and mammalian systems; extensiveextrapolation is required to predict effects in humans on these bases.The final rule establishes a permissible exposure limit of 25 ppm TWA forn-butyl glycidyl ether. <ITAG tagnum="71">CAPTAN </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 133-06-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>9</T2>H<T2>8</T2>Cl<T2>3</T2>NO<T2>2</T2>S </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1067</ITAG>OSHA did not formerly regulate captan. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 5 mg/m3for this substance, which is a white, crystalline, odorless solid. Theproposed PEL was an 8-hour TWA of 5 mg/m3, and the final rule promulgatesthis limit. Skin applications of 900 mg/kg captan produce skin irritation in experimentalanimals. Long-term feeding studies did not reveal adverse effects in dogsfed captan in the diet at levels of 100 mg/kg/day for 66 weeks or in ratsfed 1000 mg/kg/day for two years (Martin 1971/Ex. 1-1161; Spencer 1968,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 98). Male mice showed decreased fertilityat levels of 50 or 100 mg/kg/day for five days (Collins 1972/Ex. 1-893).Studies on the mutagenicity of captan indicate that the substance actsas an alkylating agent and induces chromosome rearrangements in rats andpoint mutations in <T3>Neurospora crassa </T3>(Epstein and Legator, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 98). Legator and colleagues (1969, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 98) reported that captan concentrations of 10 andCx.18;g/ml inhibitedDNA in human embryo cells, and concentrations of 1.5 andCx.18;g/ml producedchromosomal aberrations in the somatic and germ cells of kangaroo rats.Animal evidence concerning the carcinogenicity of captan is contradictory,although high doses caused significant incidences of polyploid carcinomaof the duodenum and adenomatous polyps in mice (NCI 1977a, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 98).Some captan-exposed individuals experience skin irritation (Spencer 1968,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 98). A case of recurrent urticaria causedby captan exposure has been reported and confirmed (Croy 1973/Ex. 1-894),and captan caused high reactivity when administered in a battery of patchtests (Rudner 1977/Ex. 1-967). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A) concurs with the limit being established, butnotes that captan could be classified as a potential occupational carcinogen.No other comments were received on this substance. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a PEL of 5 mg/m3 TWA to protectworkers exposed to captan from the significant risk of exposure-relatedskin irritation, reproductive effects, mutagenicity, and, perhaps, carcinogenicity,all of which constitute material health impairments. The Agency concludesthat this limit will substantially reduce these significant risks. <ITAG tagnum="71">CHLOROPRENE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 126-99-8; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>:CClCH:CH<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1088</ITAG>The former OSHA limit for beta-chloroprene was an 8-hour TWA of 25 ppm,with a skin notation. The ACGIH has a 10-ppm TLV-TWA, with a skin notation,and NIOSH (1977c/Ex. 1-277) recommended a limit of 1 ppm, measured overa 15-minute period. The proposed PEL was an 8-hour TWA of 10 ppm, and thefinal rule establishes this limit and retains the skin notation. NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs that this limit is appropriate. Chloropreneis a colorless, highly flammable liquid. The ACGIH recommended a reduction in the TLV for chloroprene from 25 ppmto 10 ppm in 1981, based on a review of the world literature by Trochimowicz,who prepared the 1980 ACGIH documentation, and by Reinhardt (1980, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 135). Reinhardt concluded that there was no evidenceindicating that the former 25-ppm PEL was not protective, but OSHA believesthe systemic effects (i.e., growth retardation) seen in rats and hamstersexposed to 39 ppm chloroprene for four weeks or to 50 ppm for a lifetimesuggest that the 25-ppm PEL is not sufficiently protective. In recommending a 1-ppm 15-minute exposure limit for chloroprene, NIOSH(1977c/Ex. 1-277) cited three reports on facilities in the Soviet Union.Katsova (1973, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 135) reported findinga significant excess of chromosomal abnormalities in the blood of workersexposed to approximately 5 ppm chloroprene. Volkova, Fomenko, Bagdinovet al. (1976/Ex. 1-1025) reported similar findings in a plant where chloroprenelevels ranged from 0.8 to 1.95 ppm. In the third study, Sanotskii (1976/Ex.1-662) reported abnormal sperm morphology among workers exposed at levelsof from 0.28 to 1.94 ppm; a threefold increase in the rate of spontaneousabortion among wives of these workers was also found. In addition, NIOSH(1977c/Ex. 1-277) cited a study by Davtian, Fomenko, and Andreyeva (1973/Ex.1-1032) that reported a significant excess of embryonic mortality in femalerats that were mated to male rats exposed to 1 ppm chloroprene. These investigatorsalso found chromosomal aberrations in the bone marrow cells of exposedmale rats. NIOSH (1977c/Ex. 1-277) also cited a number of reports showingchloroprene to be mutagenic in a variety of test systems. NIOSH concludedthat it was prudent to reduce exposure to 1 ppm over a 15-minute period,to reduce the risk of genetic abnormalities being transmitted to subsequentgenerations. This exposure represents the lowest concentration that canbe measured reliably over a 15-minute period. The Workers Institute for Safety and Health (WISH) and the AFL-CIO commentedon OSHA's proposed limit for chloroprene (Ex. 116; Tr. VII, pp. 130-131;Ex. 194). WISH raised questions about the adequacy of the ACGIH documentationfor this substance, which is critical of the Soviet literature that servedas the basis for the issuance of the first NIOSH <T3>Current Intelligence Bulletin on Chloroprene</T3> (1975c). OSHA notesthat sizable discrepancies exist between the findings from the Russianstudies and results from other studies that were undertaken to confirmthe Soviet claims. Torkelson and Rowe (1981c, in <T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology, </T3>3rd rev. ed., Vol.2B, Clayton and Clayton 1981) offer two possible explanations for thesediscrepancies:<ITAG tagnum="21">beta-Chloroprene is a very unstable compound, which, unless handledwith extreme care, . . . [epoxidizes] and polymerizes to toxic compounds.This might explain the alleged effects in animals. Alleged effects in humansmay be due to this same cause or to the use of different chemical processeswhich produce different types of impurities. Many other causes can be postulated,but in our opinion more credence must be given to animal studies in whichthe sample is known to have been handled with extreme care and to the resultsof experience in U.S. industry where the method of handling has been reported(Torkelson and Rowe 1981c, p. 3578).</ITAG>These authors report that when the purity of the sample was carefully controlled,repeated exposures to 25 ppm or less of the vapor have caused no reproductive,teratological, or embryotoxic effects in rats: ``Despite frank clinicaltoxicity in exposed pregnant rats, fetuses showed no teratogenic effectsat beta-chloroprene levels as high as 175 ppm'' (Trokelson and Rowe 1981c,pp. 3579-80). WISH also expressed concern about the ``unscientific'' use by the ACGIHof uncertainty factors with regard to this substance. WISH notes that theATSDR protocol for uncertainty factors would require a TLV of 0.05 ppmbased on lowest effect level data on growth retardation (Ex. 116). (SeeOSHA's discussion of the use of safety factors in establishing occupationalexposure limits in Section VI.A. of this preamble.) The 1-ppm (15-minute STEL) value recommended by NIOSH is based on studiesreported in the Soviet literature; in addition, this limit is set at theanalytical limit of detection. OSHA's 10-ppm PEL is based on a 1981 criticalreview of the world literature (Trochimowicz 1980, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 135) and on the observation that only mild systemic effects areobserved at 38 ppm. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWAPEL of 10 ppm, with a skin notation, to substantially reduce the significantrisk of reproductive and systemic effects, which constitute material healthimpairments that are potentially associated with exposure to chloroprene.The Agency concludes that this limit will substantially reduce this significantrisk. <ITAG tagnum="71">CYCLOHEXYLAMINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-91-8; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>13</T2>N </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1109</ITAG>OSHA had no former limit for cyclohexylamine. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of10 ppm. OSHA proposed an 8-hour TWA PEL of 10 ppm; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) concurred with the proposed limit, and the final rule promulgates thislimit. Cyclohexylamine is a liquid with a strong, fishy, amine odor.Data concerning the acute toxicity of cyclohexylamine were reported byEastman Kodak in 1958 (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 161). In rats, the oral LD<T2>50</T2> of a 5-percent solution in water was between 400 and 800 mg/kg;mice fed a diet of the 1-percent aqueous solution or the undiluted aminehad LD<T2>50</T2>s of between 200 and 400 mg/kg. Injection of the 5-percent aqueoussolution in rats produced LD<T2>50</T2>s of between 5 and 25 mg/kg, while mice injected intraperitoneallywith the 1-percent solution had LD<T2>50</T2>s of between 5 and 10 mg/kg. In guinea pigs, the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> of undiluted cyclohexylamine is reported to be between 1 and5 ml/kg. Edema, necrosis, and eschars were reported as a consequence ofthese dermal exposures. In rabbits, one drop of a 50-percent solution causedcomplete destruction of the eye. Six-hour inhalation exposures at a vaporconcentration of 12,000 ppm caused deaths in rats, but exposure to 1000ppm caused neither toxic effects nor deaths. Legator, Palmer, Green, and Petersen (1969/Ex. 1-496) considered cyclohexylamineto be a potential carcinogen, mutagen, or teratogen on the basis of dose-dependentchromosomal abnormalities observed in rats injected intraperitoneally withcyclohexylamine. Khera, Stolz, Gunner et al. (1971/Ex. 1-343) noted adverseeffects on rat fertility, and Becker and Gibson (1970/Ex. 1-298) reportedembryotoxic effects in mice intraperitoneally injected with cyclohexylamine.In contrast, Kennedy, Sanders, Weinberg et al. (1969, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 161) reported no effects of exposure to cyclohexylamineon rabbit and rat fertility, reproduction, embryogenesis, or perinataland postnatal development. In general, there is agreement concerning the moderate to severe toxicityof cyclohexylamine and its potential for intense skin irritation and moderateskin sensitization (Sax 1968b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 161).The chemical is well known to be pharmacologically active, having sympathomimeticactivity (Barger and Dale 1910/Ex. 1-1104). However, Litchfield and Swan(1971/Ex. 1-346) report that human dietary levels of 5 g/day for sevento eight days produced no pharmacologically active levels in the tissues;furthermore, no changes were detected in blood pressure, heart rate, orelectrocardiograms of exposed subjects. Chronic experimental toxicity dataare lacking, but Watrous and Schulz (1950/Ex. 1-940) have reported thatexposure to 4 to 10 ppm of cyclohexylamine caused no symptoms of any kindin acutely exposed workmen. No comments other than those of NIOSH (Ex.8-47) were received on this substance. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 10 ppm forcyclohexylamine. The Agency concludes that limiting workplace exposuresto this previously unregulated substance to the 10-ppm level will protectworkers from the significant risk of severe skin and eye irritation andsensitization, all material health impairments that are associated withexposure to cyclohexylamine. OSHA has determined that this limit will substantiallyreduce these significant occupational risks. <ITAG tagnum="71">CYHEXATIN </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 13121-70-5; Chemical Formula: (C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>11</T2>)<T2>3</T2>SnOH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1112</ITAG>Previously, OSHA had no limit for cyhexatin. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of5 mg/m3. The proposed PEL was an 8-hour TWA of 5 mg/m3. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47)concurred with the proposed limit and this is the limit established bythe final rule. At room temperature, cyhexatin exists in the form of whitecrystals. Cyhexatin has oral LD<T2>50</T2>s of 500, 700, and 654 mg/kg for rabbits, guinea pigs, and chickens,respectively. The intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> for the rat is 13 mg/kg (NIOSH 1977i/ Ex. 1-1182), and theoral LD<T2>50</T2> for rats has been reported to be 190 mg/kg (ACGIH 1974, ascited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 165). Skin exposure to a 1- to 2-percentsolution of cyhexatin in goats and cattle caused mild effects; sheep showedmild effects after application of a 0.5-percent solution. One of five sheepdied from multiple skin applications of a 1-percent suspension (Johnson,Younger, Witzel, and Radeleff 1975/Ex. 1-336). The toxicity of cyhexatin is considered to be moderate, although it isgreater than the toxicity of most other organic tin compounds. Long-termfeeding in rats produced no behavioral changes, mortality, tissue changes,or hematologic or biochemical changes in response to two years of dosingat 12 mg/kg per day; however, dosed animals were smaller than controls.After daily doses by gavage of 24 mg/kg per day for two weeks, rats showedmicroscopic changes in the liver, kidneys, and adrenal glands at autopsy.Six mg/kg is considered to be the no-effect level in rats, and in dogs,the no-effect feeding level is reported to be 3 mg/kg. Rats fed 4 to 6mg/kg, and rabbits fed 3 mg/kg, showed no ill effects on indices for fertility,gestation, viability, or lactation (Dow Chemical Company 1973d, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 165). No inhalation data on animals are available,and there are no human data. Other than the comment by NIOSH (Ex. 8-47),no comments were received on this substance. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 5 mg/m3for cyhexatin. OSHA concludes that a PEL of 5 mg/m3 will protect workersagainst the significant risk of skin and respiratory irritation, as wellas other possible adverse effects associated with exposure to this tincompound in the absence of a current limit. The Agency considers eye andrespiratory irritation to be material health impairments within the meaningof the Act.<ITAG tagnum="71">DICHLORODIPHENYLTRICHLORO- ETHANE (DDT) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 50-29-3; Chemical Formula: C<T2>14</T2>H<T2>9</T2>Cl<T2>5 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1113</ITAG>OSHA's existing limit for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is 1 mg/m3TWA as an 8-hour TWA, with a skin notation. The ACGIH has the same 8-hourTWA limit for DDT, without a skin notation. NIOSH has a REL of 0.5 mg/m3for DDT. The Agency proposed to retain both the skin notation for DDT andthe existing 8-hour TWA limit. The final rule retains the skin notationand the Agency's 8-hour TWA PEL. DDT is a noncombustible, colorless towhite powder with a slightly aromatic odor. The U.S. Public Health Service (Neal, von Oettingen, Smith et al. 1944,as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 168) reports that six daily exposures of onehour each to 423 mg/m3 DDT was without effect in human volunteers. Barnes(1953, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 168/Ex. 1-3) reported that a review ofthe world literature revealed no illness among workers from many countrieswho applied DDT as an insecticide. At chronic exposure levels of 35 mg/person/day,no adverse health effects are observed in humans, but DDT does accumulatein the fatty tissues of the body and it is possible that delayed effectsmight occur after many years (ACGIH 1986, p. 168/Ex. 1-3). OSHA receivedno comments on DDT except those from NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B), whichurged regulation of DDT as a potential occupational carcinogen. The dermalLD<T2>50 </T2>in rabbits is 400 mg/kg (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>7th ed., Sax andLewis 1989), indicating a significant degree of percutaneous absorptionthat justifies the skin notation. Based on a review of the evidence of the health effects of exposure toDDT, OSHA concludes that the existing PEL of 1.0 mg/m3 is adequate to protectworkers from the significant risk of bioaccumulation of DDT in adiposetissue, which may have the potential to produce delayed ill effects inlater years. The Agency finds that the existing limit, with its skin notation,provides appropriate protection against DDT's systemic effects. <ITAG tagnum="71">2-N-DIBUTYLAMINOETHANOL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 102-81-8; Chemical Formula: (C<T2>4</T2>H<T2>9</T2>)<T2>2</T2>NCH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>OH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1120</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no limit for 2-N-dibutylaminoethanol (DBAE). The ACGIHhas a TLV-TWA of 2 ppm, with a skin notation, for this colorless, combustibleliquid, which has a faint, amine-like odor. The proposed PEL was 2 ppmas an 8-hour TWA. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) concurred with this limit, and thisis the limit established by the final rule. The proposed skin notationis not retained in the final rule. In rats, 2-N-dibutylaminoethanol has a single-dose oral LD<T2>50 </T2>of 1.7 g/kg and a corresponding intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> of 0.14 g/kg; these values are approximately analogous to theoral and intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2>s for diethanolamine (Hartung and Cornish 1968/Ex. 1-328). TheLD<T2>50</T2> for skin absorption in rabbits is 1.68 g/kg (Smyth, Carpenter,Weil, and Pozzani 1954/Ex. 1-440). In male rats, the lowest five-week drinkingwater dose tolerated without weight loss was 0.13 g/kg/day. Rats that ingesteda dose of 0.43 g/kg/day showed elevated kidney-to-body-weight ratios butno histologic changes at autopsy (Cornish, Dambrauskas, and Beatty 1969/Ex.1-411). In inhalation studies of rats, 6-hour exposures at 70 ppm for fivedays killed one rat; the surviving rats showed a 57-percent average bodyweight loss, as well as a doubling of kidney-to-body-weight ratios, a tenfoldincrease in serum bilirubin, a slight increase in clotting time, and anelevated hematocrit. Inhalation of 33 ppm for one week caused a 3-percentbody weight loss and a slight increase in clotting time, but no significantchanges in the other variables observed. Twenty-seven weeks of exposureto 22 ppm resulted in no differences between exposed rats and controlsin the variables measured (Cornish, Dambrauskas, and Beatty 1969/Ex. 1-411).2-N-dibutylaminoethanol is a more potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase<T3>in vitro </T3>than is diethylamine (DEA) (Hartung and Cornish 1968/Ex.1-328). NIOSH was the only commenter to the rulemaking record for DBAE.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 2 ppm for2-N-dibutylaminoethanol. The Agency concludes that this limit will protectworkers from the significant risk of metabolic effects associated withinhalation exposure at the levels permitted in the absence of any OSHAlimit. OSHA has determined that this substance does not present a significantrisk of systemic toxicity via percutaneous absorption (2-N-dibutylaminoethanol'sdermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 1.68 g/kg) and therefore, that no skin notationis required. Accordingly, the skin notation proposed for DBAE is not retainedin the final rule. <ITAG tagnum="71">DIGLYCIDYL ETHER </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 2238-07-5; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>10</T2>O<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1139</ITAG>The former OSHA limit for diglycidyl ether (DGE) was 0.5 ppm as a ceilingconcentration, and the ACGIH-recommended TLV is 0.1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.NIOSH recommends a limit of 0.2 ppm for DGE as a 15-minute ceiling. OSHAproposed an 8-hour TWA of 0.1 ppm, and this limit is established in thefinal rule. Both the previous ACGIH 0.5-ppm TLV and that organization's current TLVare based on the results of an animal study reported by Hine and Rowe (1963b,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 202) in which rats were administeredrepeated 4-hour exposures of 20, 3, or 0.3 ppm DGE. Rats exposed to 20ppm of DGE showed respiratory irritation, loss of body weight, decreasedleukocyte count, involution of the spleen and thymus, and hemorrhagic bonemarrow. Residual hematopoietic effects were observed among rats exposedto 3 ppm, and no observed effects were noted among rats exposed to 0.3ppm, even after as many as 60 exposures. The ACGIH's previous TLV of 0.5ppm as a ceiling value was based on the no-observed-effect level of 0.3ppm reported in the Hine and Rowe (1963b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 202) study and on industrial experience. In 1979, the ACGIH reconsideredits limit for DGE, noting that, ``in view of the seriousness of some ofthe effects produced [in the rat study], a TLV below the no-ill-effectlevel [of 0.3 ppm] would normally be adopted'' (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3). TheACGIH consequently revised the TLV to 0.1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. NIOSH concurs with this limit but notes that DGE may be a potential occupationalcarcinogen (Ex. 8-47), and the Workers Institute for Safety and Health(Ex. 116) objected to the establishment of a ceiling limit. No other commentswere received on this substance. In the final rule, OSHA concludes that the revised 8-hour TWA limit of0.1 ppm will protect workers against the significant risk of hematopoieticand irritant effects, which constitute material health impairments andto which they were potentially exposed at OSHA's former PEL. The risksof DGE exposure range from respiratory irritation to bone marrow effects.The final rule's limit for DGE will reduce this risk substantially. <ITAG tagnum="71">ETHANOLAMINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 141-43-5; Chemical Formula: NH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>OH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

OSHA proposedto retain the 8-hour TWA PEL of 3 ppm and to supplement this limit witha 6-ppm STEL; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table Nl) concurred with the proposed limits,and the final rule establishes them. Ethanolamine is a colorless liquidwith a mild smell like that of ammonia. The health hazards associated with exposures to ethanolamine include irritationand necrosis of the skin and central nervous system depression. The oralLD<T2>50</T2> in rats is reported as 3.32 g/kg, and the intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is 981 mg/kg (Hartung and Cornish 1968/Ex. 1-328).The dermal toxicity of ethanolamine is considerably higher, with an LD<T2>50</T2> of 1 mg/kg reported in the rabbit. Dermal application of theundiluted liquid also caused redness, swelling, and burns comparable tomild first-degree burns (Union Carbide Corporation, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 235). The eye injury potential of ethanolamine is just slightlyless than that of undiluted ammonia (Carpenter and Smyth 1946/Ex. 1-859).Rats fed 0.5 percent (320 mg/kg/day) ethanolamine in their food for 90days (Smyth, Carpenter, and Weil 1951/Ex. 1-439) showed no adverse effects,but at 1.28 g/kg/day, fatalities occurred. Treon, Cleveland, Stemmer, andassociates (1957/Ex. 1-1172) reported lung, liver, and kidney damage invarious species exposed to high concentrations of the vapor and mist. Intests of various species, Weeks and co-workers (1960/Ex. 1-941) reportedmarked dermal effects from continuous exposures (24 hours/day, seven days/week,for from 24 to 90 days) at various concentrations of the vapor; at 12 to26 ppm, dermal effects were less severe, but at 5 ppm, skin irritationwas still evident. After 90 days of exposure to 5 ppm, dogs also experienceda slight and temporary weight loss as well as decreased activity and alertness(Weeks, Downing, Musselman et al. 1960/Ex. 1-941). Luck and Wilcox (1953/Ex.1-917) demonstrated that a portion of low doses of ethanolamine is notexcreted and is presumably retained in the body of cats, rats, and rabbits.In studies of anesthetized dogs, Priddle (1954, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 235) reported that sublethal doses of ethanolamine cause centralnervous system stimulation, while lethal doses cause CNS depression. Ethanolamine'sirritant and necrotic effects on the skin are not related to its alkalinity(Hinglais 1947/Ex. 1-909). OSHA received no comments, other than the oneby NIOSH (Ex. 8-47), on this substance. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a PEL of 3 ppm as an 8-hour TWAand a 15-minute STEL of 6 ppm for ethanolamine. The Agency concludes thatboth of these limits are required to protect workers against the significantrisk of irritation and neuropathic effects, which constitute material healthimpairments that are potentially associated with exposure to ethanolamineat levels permitted above the 8-hour TWA limit. The Agency has determinedthat these limits will substantially reduce this significant risk.  <ITAG tagnum="71">ETHYLENE CHLOROHYDRIN </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-07-3; Chemical Formula: C1CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>OH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PEL was a ceiling of 1 ppm, with a skin notation.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) concurred with the proposed limit, and the final ruleestablishes this limit and retains the skin notation. Ethylene chlorohydrinis a colorless liquid with a faint, ethereal odor.A broad range of serious health hazards are associated with exposure tothis substance; these include central nervous system effects, cardiovasculareffects, liver damage, kidney damage, gastrointestinal effects, skin irritation,eye irritation, and mutagenic effects. OSHA considers that all of theseeffects constitute material health impairments. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> for rats is 72 mg/kg, and the intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> in the same species is 56 mg/kg (Goldblatt and Chiesman 1944/Ex.1-980). In guinea pigs, the intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> is 98 mg/kg, and the percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> is 205 mg/kg (Wahlberg and Boman 1978/Ex. 1-938). The skin absorption rate for ethylene chlorohydrin is high; Semenova andassociates (1978/Ex. 1-932) determined that the LD<T2>50</T2> must be reduced to one-fifth of its original value if ethylenechlorohydrin is administered daily for 20 days (Semenova, Kazanina, Fedyaninaet al. 1978/Ex. 1-932). The inhalation toxicity of ethylene chlorohydrin is also high. Ambrose(1950/Ex. 1-888) reported that a single one-hour exposure at 7.5 ppm andrepeated one-hour exposures at 2 ppm can be fatal to rats. Exposures of15 minutes daily at concentrations of from 900 to 1000 ppm were fatal torats within a few days (Goldblatt and Chiesman 1944/Ex. 1-980). In subacute and chronic studies, rats have died from a daily dietary doseof 67.5 mg/kg (Oser, Morgareidge, Cox, and Carson 1975/Ex. 1-923). Semenovaand associates (1980, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 248) reporteda four-month no-effect inhalation level of 0.0033 ppm; at 0.017 ppm, slightCNS changes and alterations in the urinary secretion of nitrogen were observedafter four months. These investigators also observed increased chromosomalaberrations in bone marrow in rats exposed at the 0.22-ppm level for fourmonths (Semenova, Kazanina, Fedyanina et al. 1980, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 248). Voogt and Vet (1969/Ex. 1-1205) tested ethylene chlorohydrin in <T3>Klebsiella pneumoniae </T3>and found it strongly mutagenic. This findingwas confirmed by the Ames test in <T3>Salmonella typhimurium; </T3>ethylene chlorohydrin reacts with DNA,since it inhibits the growth of DNA-deficient bacteria (Rosenkranz andWlodkowski 1974/Ex. 1-1201). A dose-related increase of liver protein anddepletion in glutathion was observed in rats after a single dose of ethylenechlorohydrin of from 10 to 50 mg/kg (Friedman, Scalera, Balazs et al. 1977/Ex.1-1198). One fatal and several nonfatal cases of poisoning in industrial workershave been reported from exposure (for unspecified periods of time) to ethylenechlorohydrin at levels of between 300 and 500 ppm. An autopsy of the workerwho died revealed severe damage to the liver and brain, as well as effectsin other organs. The survivors experienced nausea, vomiting, and irritationof the eyes, nose, and lungs (Bush, Abrams, and Brown 1949/Ex. 1-1196).Dierker and Brown (1944/Ex. 1-1197) reported that a two-hour inhalationexposure to 300 ppm was fatal in one accidental exposure. OSHA receivedno comments, other than that of NIOSH (Ex. 8-47), on this substance. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a ceiling limit of 1 ppm for ethylenechlorohydrin and is retaining the skin notation. The Agency concludes thatthis limit will substantially reduce the significant risk of central nervoussystem and other systemic effects associated with workplace exposures atthe levels permitted by the TWA limit alone. The skin notation is retainedbecause ethylene chlorohydrin is readily absorbed through the skin. <ITAG tagnum="71">GLYCIDOL (2,3-EPOXY-1-PROPANOL) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 556-52-5; Chemical Formula: C<T2>3</T2>H<T2>6</T2>O<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) concurred with this limit,and the final rule promulgates this PEL. Glycidol causes eye, respiratory, and pulmonary irritation. Hine and associates(1956/Ex. 1-331) conducted a study of animal toxicity caused by glycidolexposure and reported that glycidol is irritating to the lungs, with miceand rats exhibiting pneumonitis and emphysema resulting from vapor inhalation.The LC<T2>50</T2> reported for mice is 450 ppm for a four-hour exposure; the8-hour LC<T2>50</T2> for rats is 580 ppm (Hine, Kodama, Wellington et al. 1956/Ex.1-331). A single dermal application was only mildly irritating (Draizescore 4.5); however, repeated daily skin applications were severely irritatingafter four days. One drop of pure glycidol in the rabbit eye caused severebut reversible corneal injury (Hine, Kodama, Wellington et al. 1956/Ex.1-331). In rats, chronic exposures to 400 ppm (seven hours/day for 50 days)did not cause systemic toxicity, but eye irritation and respiratory distresswere observed after the first few exposures (Hine, Kodama, Wellington etal. 1956/Ex. 1-331). A study to determine glycidol's tumorigenic potentialon the skin of mice showed negative results (Van Duuren, Langseth, Goldschmidt,and Orris 1967/Ex. 1-1203). OSHA received no comments, other than thatof NIOSH (Ex. 8-47), on this substance. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 25 ppm TWAfor glycidol.

The proposed PEL was an 8-hour TWA of 0.1 ppm, with a skinnotation. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) concurred with these limits, which are establishedby the final rule. Inhalation studies of hexafluoroacetone in animals have shown varied systemictoxicities, including injury to the liver, kidney, testes, thymus, andbone marrow. In rats and dogs exposed six hours/day, five days/week for13 weeks at concentrations of about 0.1, 1.0, or 12 ppm, no effects (otherthan increased lung weights in dogs) were observed in either species at0.1 ppm. However, the 12-ppm exposures produced severe effects in bothspecies, including marked but reversible testicular damage and slight hypoplasiaof the spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes (E.I. du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co.,Inc. 1971, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 303). Reversible kidney damagein rats and increased lung weights in dogs occurred during the 1.0-ppmexposures. An earlier four-hour acute exposure of rats demonstrated that300 ppm was a lethal concentration (E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Inc.1971, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 303). In rats, two-week dermal exposures of 65, 130, or 250 mg/kg resulted innumerous adverse effects, including testicular damage and correspondingchanges in lipid metabolism (Kennedy, Henry, Chen, and Dashiell 1982/Ex.1-1038). A dermal dose of 13 mg/kg produced no adverse effects in rats(Lee and Gillies 1984/Ex. 1-561). An injected dose of radiolabeled hexafluoroacetonewas, for the most part, rapidly excreted in the urine in unmetabolizedform; this material also did not accumulate in rat testes (Gillies andRickard 1984/Ex. 1-322). Brittelli and co-workers (1979/Ex. 1-300) reportedthat hexafluoroacetone was fetotoxic in rats. Dermal application of 90mg/kg/day to pregnant rats resulted in maternal toxicity. Fetal toxicityoccurred at maternal doses of 25 mg/kg, and fetal size was reduced at maternaldoses of 5 and 25 mg/kg; however, 1 mg/kg produced no fetal effect. Althoughsoft-tissue damage and external abnormalities were observed, teratogenicitycould not be demonstrated definitively (Brittelli, Culik, Dashiell, andFayerweather 1979/Ex. 1-300). Other than the comment by NIOSH (Ex. 8-47),OSHA received no comments on this substance. The final rule establishes an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.1 ppm TWA and a skinnotation for hexafluoroacetone. The Agency concludes that these limits,taken together, will protect workers from the significant risk of systemicinjuries at multiple organ sites, reproductive effects, kidney damage,and fetotoxic effects, all of which constitute material health impairmentsthat are associated with exposure to hexafluoroacetone at levels abovethe new PEL. <ITAG tagnum="71">HYDROGEN CYANIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 74-90-8; Chemical Formula: HCN </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1207</ITAG>The former OSHA limit for hydrogen cyanide was a 10-ppm 8-hour TWA, witha skin notation. The ACGIH has a 10-ppm ceiling limit, also with a skinnotation. NIOSH (1976e/ Ex. 1-240) has recommended that workplace exposuresto hydrogen cyanide not exceed 4.7 ppm (5 mg/m3) as a 10-minute ceiling.OSHA proposed a 10-minute ceiling of 4.7 ppm for hydrogen cyanide, andthe final rule establishes this limit as a 15-minute STEL. The skin notationis retained. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs with the selection of thisPEL. Hydrogen cyanide is a colorless gas at room temperature. The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) has summarized the extensive body of human evidenceon the adverse effects resulting from exposure to hydrogen cyanide. The<T3>Documentation</T3> notes that exposure to levels of 45 to 54 ppm hydrogencyanide can be tolerated for one hour with no immediate or delayed effects,but that 18 to 36 ppm produces ``slight'' symptoms after several hoursof exposure. The ACGIH also cites Grabois (1954/ Ex. 1-1150), who reportedthat workers in apricot kernel processing plants experienced no ill effectswhen exposed to hydrogen cyanide at a concentration of approximately 10ppm. The NIOSH recommendation of 4.7 ppm as a 10-minute ceiling limit is basedlargely on an epidemiologic study by El Ghawabi et al. (1975/Ex. 1-632)that showed an increase in symptoms of headache, weakness, throat irritation,vomiting, dyspnea, lacrimation, colic, and nervousness among workers exposedto cyanide for an average of 7.5 years. The 36 male workers that were studiedwere employed in three electroplating factories. Breathing zone samples(15 minutes in duration) were collected and ranged from 4.2 to 12.4 ppm.Cyanide levels at two of the three plants did not exceed 9.6 ppm. El Ghawabiet al. (1975/Ex. 1-632) also reported that two workers in one plant sufferedfrom psychotic episodes; these conditions were reported to be similar tocases that occurred during the therapeutic use of thiocyanate. Mean valuesof urinary thiocyanate in the 36 workers correlated well with air concentrationsof cyanide (El Ghawabi, Gaafar, El-Saharti et al. 1975/Ex. 1-632). Symptoms resulting from chronic exposure to cyanide were also reportedby Radojicic (1973, as cited in NIOSH 1976e/Ex. 1-240) among workers exposedto HCN levels between 5.4 and 12.3 ppm, and by Saia, DeRosa, and Galzigna(1970, as cited in NIOSH 1976e/Ex. 1-240). NIOSH (1976e/Ex. 1-240) interpretedthe significance of these studies as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Colle (1972) . . . advanced the belief that these symptoms of headache,dyspnea, epigastric burning, vertigo, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, tremor,and precordial pain represent a true clinical entity and that they aresufficiently documented and characteristic of chronic cyanide exposureto be grouped into a true syndrome. . . . </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Chaumont (1960) . . . also stated that there is no clinical evidenceto deny that cyanides can cause this type of occupational intoxication.He apparently found the debate on whether this intoxication is truly chronicor whether it involves repeated subacute symptoms to be semantic in natureand opted for the admission that chronic intoxication caused by HCN andthe cyanide salts is a true occupational disease. . . . </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Thus, one might describe chronic cyanide poisoning as a slow deteriorationof resistance, and, therefore, an intensified sensitivity, due to inadequatetime between exposures for replacement of damaged tissues, enzyme systemsand metabolic stores, the elimination of detoxication products, and theregeneration of homeostatic mechanisms (NIOSH 1976e/Ex. 1-240, pp. 90-91).</ITAG>OSHA received a few comments, in addition to that made by NIOSH (Ex. 8-47),on its proposal to revise the PEL for HCN to 4.7 ppm (5 mg/m3) as a short-termlimit. Dr. Lawrence Hecker, representing Abbott Laboratories (Ex. 3-678),recommended that OSHA retain its former skin notation for HCN; OSHA's intentionto do so was inadvertently omitted from the discussion of hydrogen cyanidein the NPRM. There is ample evidence that cyanide penetrates the skin insufficient quantities to cause systemic effects (NIOSH 1976e/Ex. 1-240).Accordingly, OSHA is retaining its skin notation for HCN in the final rule.BP America (Ex. 8-57; Tr. 9-127) urged OSHA to establish the ACGIH TLVrather than the NIOSH REL for HCN, and the New Jersey Department of Healthurged use of EPA's IRIS data to set a PEL for this substance (Ex. 144).In response to these commenters, OSHA notes that the ACGIH is not, in theAgency's opinion, sufficiently protective. Use of the IRIS data is discussedin Section VI.A. OSHA concludes that a variety of symptoms are associated with exposureto hydrogen cyanide at levels less than 10 ppm. This shows that neitherthe former PEL nor the ACGIH TLV is sufficiently protective. In the finalrule, OSHA is therefore establishing a 4.7-ppm 15-minute STEL as the PEL.The Agency finds that the final rule's short-term limit will protect workersfrom the significant risk of headache, weakness, colic, and nervousness,which together constitute material impairment of health; these effectshave been observed in individuals exposed at the 10-ppm level over a fullworking shift. OSHA concludes that this limit will substantially reducethese significant risks. <ITAG tagnum="71">HYDROGENATED TERPHENYLS </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS No.: 61788-32-7; Chemical Formula: None </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1210</ITAG>Previously, OSHA did not regulate the hydrogenated terphenyls. The ACGIHhas a TLV-TWA of 0.5 ppm (approximately 5 mg/m3) TWA for these complexmixtures of ortho-, meta-, and para-terphenyls in various stages of hydrogenation.The proposed PEL was 0.5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) concurredwith the proposed limit, and the final rule establishes that limit. Acute exposure to the hydrogenated terphenyls poses a risk of potentiallung, eye, and skin damage. Chronic exposure presents a risk of systemictoxicity involving injury to the liver, kidneys, and blood-forming organs,as well as possible metabolic disturbances and cancer (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 311). Early studies of unhydrogenated terphenyl isomers determined that the LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is low, i.e., 1900 mg/kg for the ortho isomer, 2400mg/kg for the meta isomer, and 10,000 mg/kg for the para isomer (Cornish,Bahor, and Ryan 1962/Ex. 1-410). Thirty-day oral administration of 500mg/kg/day in the diet of rats indicated possible liver and kidney damage,which was suggested by increases in the liver- and kidney-to-body-weightratios and decreases in the rate of weight gain (Cornish, Bahor, and Ryan1962/Ex. 1-410). Other studies have demonstrated nephrotoxicity and liverdamage in rats fed 33 mg/kg or more of unirradiated terphenyl isomers (Petkauand Hoogstraaten 1965/Ex. 1-432; Young, Petkau, and Hoogstraaten 1969/Ex.1-459). Inhalation studies showed that bronchopneumonia is associated withexposure at 88 to 356 ppm to the ortho and meta isomers, but not to thepara isomer at 103 ppm (Haley, Detrick, Komesu et al. 1959/Ex. 1-326).The work of Cornish, Bahor, and Ryan (1962/Ex. 1-410) showed that noneof the isomers caused skin irritation in rabbits following a 24-hour dermalapplication. For terphenyls that are approximately 40-percent hydrogenated,the acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is reported as 17,500 mg/kg; in mice, it is 12,500mg/kg (Adamson and Weeks 1973/Ex. 1-295). This study also demonstratedthat an irradiated hydrogenated terphenyl mixture is three times more acutelytoxic by ingestion than is a nonirradiated mixture. This finding was confirmedin 16-week chronic ingestion studies (Adamson, Bowden, and Wyatt 1969/Ex.1-293); these authors found that 1200 mg/kg of an irradiated mixture waslethal to mice, while the same dose in nonirradiated form produced onlyan irreversible interstitial nephritis. In the same study, no effects wereobserved for either mixture at a dose level of 250 mg/kg. Eight-day inhalation studies in mice showed some pathologic changes inlung tissue after 500 mg/m3 (50 ppm) exposures to nonirradiated hydrogenatedterphenyls; eight-week exposures at 2000 mg/m3 (200 ppm) resulted in thesame lung damage, as well as in some proliferation of the smooth endoplasticreticulum in the liver (Adamson, Bowden, and Wyatt 1969/Ex. 1-293; Adamsonand Weeks 1973/Ex. 1-295). Carcinogenesis in mice has been reported from8-week skin exposures to the irradiated mixture (Henderson and Weeks 1973/Ex.1-784). The significance of the changes observed by Adamson and Furlong(1974/Ex. 1-294) in the mouse lung after eight weeks of inhalation exposureto the irradiated mixture is difficult to interpret in terms of the potentialof the hydrogenated terphenyls to cause pulmonary cancer; particles werefound to clear the lungs rapidly but to accumulate and clear more slowlyin the intestine, kidney, and liver. No comments other than those of NIOSH(Ex. 8-47) were received on this substance. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 0.5-ppm 8-hour TWA for the complexmixtures of ortho-, meta-, and para- terphenyls (either irradiated or nonirradiated)in various stages of hydrogenation. The Agency concludes that this limitwill protect workers from the significant risks of eye, skin, and lungdamage and of systemic toxicity to the liver, kidneys, and blood-formingorgans, all material health impairments that are potentially associatedwith exposure to these substances at levels above the new PEL. <ITAG tagnum="71">2-ISOPROPOXYETHANOL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 109-59-1; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2>CHOCH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>OH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1223</ITAG>OSHA had no former limit for 2-isopropoxyethanol. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWAof 25 ppm for this mobile liquid. The proposed PEL was 25 ppm as an 8-hourTWA, and the final rule establishes this limit. 2-Isopropoxyethanol has been demonstrated to produce systemic toxicityin laboratory animals. In studies of rats, 15 six-hour exposures at 1000ppm caused hemoglobinuria, anemia, and lung congestion, but no fatalities(Gage 1970/Ex. 1-318). At 300 ppm, Gage reported transient hemoglobin andMCHC decreases and lung congestion after 15 exposures. Exposure at the100-ppm level produced no effect (Gage 1970/Ex. 1-318). Another study reporteda significant increase in the osmotic fragility of erythrocytes in femalerats after a four-hour inhalation exposure to 62 ppm, but no effect wasobserved at 32 ppm (Carpenter, Pozzani, Weil et al. 1956/Ex. 1-303). Studiesof four species exposed at concentrations of 200, 50, or 25 ppm for sixhours/day for 26 weeks resulted in hematologic changes only in rats; increasedosmotic fragility of erythrocytes was marked at 200 ppm, slight at 50 ppm,and minimal at 25 ppm (Moffett, Linnett, and Blair 1976, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 235). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) did not concur with OSHA's proposed limit of 25 ppm, notingthat 25 ppm represented an effect level. Although ``slight'' increasesin osmotic fragility were reported in animals subchronically exposed (Moffett,Linnett, and Blair 1976, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 235), OSHAnotes that a marked reaction did not occur until exposure was increasedeightfold. Therefore, at this time, OSHA judges the 25-ppm PEL to be sufficientlyprotective. OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 25 ppm for 2-isopropoxyethanolin the final rule. The Agency concludes that this limit will substantiallyreduce the significant risk of hemolytic effects, which are material healthimpairments that are associated with exposure to this substance at levelsabove the new PEL. <ITAG tagnum="71">ISOPROPYL GLYCIDYL ETHER </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 4016-14-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>12</T2>O<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1227</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for isopropyl glycidyl ether (IGE) was 50 ppm as an8-hour TWA. The ACGIH has an 8-hour TWA of 50 ppm and a 15-minute STELof 75 ppm for IGE. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N7) recommends a limit of 50ppm as a 15-minute ceiling. OSHA proposed an 8-hour TWA of 50 ppm and a15-minute STEL of 75 ppm for IGE, and these limits are established in thefinal rule. IGE is a colorless, volatile liquid. The 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> for IGE in mice was 1500 ppm and the 8-hour LC<T2>50</T2> in rats was 1100 ppm (Hine, Kodama, Wellington et al. 1956/Ex.1-331). The intragastric LD<T2>50</T2>s in mice and rats were 1.30 and 4.2 g/kg, respectively; inrabbits, the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> was 9.65 g/kg (Hine, Kodama, Wellington et al. 1956/Ex. 1-331).Fifty daily seven-hour exposures of rats to 400 ppm caused a reduced rateof weight gain, an increase in hemoglobin, a decrease in peritoneal fat,and, in some animals, emphysematous lungs and mottling of the liver (Hine,Kodama, Wellington et al. 1956/Ex. 1-331). Animals in this study also exhibitedsigns of ocular irritation and respiratory distress. In humans, eye, nose, and upper respiratory irritation occurred in thetechnicians handling the animals in the Hine and co-workers (1956/Ex. 1-331)study; exposure levels were not specified. Dermatitis has also been reportedin workers exposed to other glycidyl ethers during manufacture, and onesuch case involved IGE exposure (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 340). In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA of 50 ppm and addinga 15-minute STEL of 75 ppm for IGE. The Agency concludes that both theTWA and STEL are necessary to reduce the risk to workers of chronic organeffects, such as those demonstrated to occur in animals (Hine, Kodama,Wellington et al. 1956/Ex. 1-331), and the significant risk of eye, skin,and upper respiratory tract irritation associated with short-term IGE exposuresat the levels permitted in the absence of a short-term limit.

No. 1273</ITAG>Previously, OSHA had no limit for 4,4-methylene bis (2-chloroaniline),or MBOCA, although in 1974, OSHA did issue a standard for MBOCA as partof the Agency's ``14 Carcinogens'' rulemaking; however, the reviewing courtset the MBOCA standard aside on procedural grounds. The ACGIH has a limitof 0.02 ppm (0.22 mg/m3) TWA, with a skin notation, and classifies MBOCAas a suspected human carcinogen (A2). NIOSH recommends a TWA limit of 3andCx.18;g/m3 for MBOCA, which NIOSH considers a potential occupational carcinogen.OSHA proposed an 8-hour TWA of 0.02 ppm TWA for MBOCA, with a skin notation;the final rule establishes these limits. MBOCA is a tan-colored solid.MBOCA is highly toxic, causing cyanosis, kidney irritation, methemoglobinemia,and cancer. It is similar in effect to the other aromatic amines (Hoseinand van Roosmalen 1978/ Ex. 1-1054; Mastromatteo 1965/Ex. 1-146). Steinhoff and Grundmann (1969/Ex. 1-762) demonstrated that feeding MBOCAat unspecified levels to rats on a protein-deficient diet caused a highincidence of liver cancer. Russfield, Homburger, Boger and associates (1975/Ex.1-929) reported liver and lung tumors in rats fed MBOCA while on a standarddiet. Dogs fed MBOCA at a dose of 100 mg/day, five days/week showed nohepatic cancer, but malignant nodules in the bladder occurred in a dogfed MBOCA for nine years (Stula et al. 1977, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 392.4). In industry, reversible hematuria has been reported among MBOCA-exposedworkers, but precise concentration data are lacking (Mastromatteo 1965/Ex.1-146). An early study of workers exposed for as long as 18 years to MBOCAshowed no adverse effects, although the substance and its metabolites weredetected in the urine of these subjects (Linch, O'Connor, Barnes et al.1971/Ex. 1-791). Hosein and van Roosmalen (1978/Ex. 1-1054) reported anindustrial accident in which molten MBOCA was splashed in a worker's face;urinary levels of 3.6 mg/L MBOCA, as well as protein, were detected inthe urine, and the subject experienced nausea. However, this worker recoveredquickly. A recent NIOSH retrospective study involving 370 workers employed in aMBOCA-manufacturing plant evaluated the carcinogenicity of this substance,which is structurally similar to benzidine. This study found two casesof bladder cancers in very young workers (less than 30 years of age), bothof whom were nonsmokers. The Polyurethane Manufacturers Association (PMA) expressed its supportfor establishing a 0.02-ppm TWA for MBOCA, stating that the proposal ``willsignificantly assist in assuring that any exposure to the chemical is appropriatelycontrolled while imposing a regulation which can be feasibly complied withby employers'' (Ex. 3-683, p. 4). In addition, the PMA indicated that,with currently applied engineering and work practice controls, MBOCA ``canbe used with no or very limited employee exposure'' (Ex. 3-683, p. 5).The PMA also supported establishment of a PEL for MBOCA ``to provide OSHAwith a chemical-specific enforcement capability to deal with any isolatedinstances where a user of the chemical also disregards recognized industrypractices and fails to reasonably control employee exposure to the chemical''(Ex. 3-683, p. 7). The PMA supported the addition of a skin notation forMBOCA, identifying dermal contact as a ``principal potential route foremployee exposure'' (Ex. 3-683, p. 7).NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B) did not concur with OSHA's proposed PEL andrecommended instead that the Agency undertake a separate 6(b) rulemakingfor MBOCA. OSHA is aware of the two bladder cancer cases reported by NIOSH,and will continue to monitor the toxicologic evidence on MBOCA in the futureto determine whether the evidence warrants a further reduction in the exposurelimit. The AFL-CIO (Ex. 194) urged OSHA to promulgate ancillary limitsfor MBOCA; however, as discussed in Section IV.D., the Agency is not atthis time promulgating such provisions because of the size and scope ofthis rulemaking. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.02 ppmfor MBOCA, with a skin notation. The Agency concludes that this limit willprotect workers against the significant risks of cyanosis, methemoglobinemia,kidney irritation, and bladder cancer, all material health impairmentspotentially associated with exposure to this substance. A skin notationis established to protect against the percutaneous absorption and systemictoxicity demonstrated by this substance in industrial accidents. <ITAG tagnum="71">PHENYLHYDRAZINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 100-63-0; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>NHNH<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1317</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for phenylhydrazine was 5 ppm TWA as an 8-hour, witha skin notation. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 5 ppm with a STEL of 10 ppm,and a skin notation. NIOSH (1978e/Ex. 1-263) recommends that workplaceexposures not exceed 0.14 ppm as measured over a two-hour period. OSHAproposed to retain the PEL of 5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and to add a STELof 10 ppm, with a skin notation, and these limits are established in thefinal rule. Phenylhydrazine may be either yellow crystals or an oily liquidthat darkens on exposure to air and light. No data are available on the effects of phenylhydrazine resulting frominhalation. The ACGIH limits are based on the high acute toxicity of thecompound when administered orally or subcutaneously to animals; singledoses on the order of 20 mg/kg have resulted in the death of dogs within22 days (Hesse, Franke, and Hering 1935/Ex. 1-785) and produced a markeddecrease in erythrocyte count in rodents (von Oettingen and Deichmann-Greubler1936/Ex. 1-771). Anemia and hemolysis are the characteristic responsesseen in animals fed or injected with phenylhydrazine. In its criteria document on the hydrazines, NIOSH (1978e/Ex. 1-263) reviewedfour studies on the carcinogenicity of phenylhydrazine in mice. One study(Toth and Shimizu 1976/Ex. 1-675) found significant increases in bloodvessel tumors. Another study (Clayson, Biancifiori, Milia, and Santilli1966, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 477) reported increased incidencesof lung adenomas and adenocarcinomas. Two other studies (Roe, Grant, andMillican 1967/Ex. 1-659; Kelly, O'Gara, Yancy et al. 1969/Ex. 1-703) werenegative. NIOSH concluded that phenylhydrazine should be considered a potentialhuman carcinogen and recommended that exposures not exceed 0.14 ppm overa two-hour sampling period, which represents the lowest level that canbe detected reliably. The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) has placed phenylhydrazineon its A2 (suspected human carcinogens) list. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B; Tr. 3-97 to 3-98), the Workers Institute forSafety and Health (WISH) (Ex. 116), the AFL-CIO (Ex. 194), the Oil Chemicaland Atomic Workers (Tr. 9-218), and the American Industrial Hygiene Association(Ex. 8-16) were of the opinion that OSHA's proposed revision of the PELfor phenylhydrazine was not sufficiently protective. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) indicatedthat phenylhydrazine may be a suitable candidate for an individual 6(b)rulemaking. Typical of the views of these commenters was the statementof WISH (Ex. 116), which commented that the ACGIH had, at one time, consideredreducing its 5-ppm TLV-TWA, and cited a 1974 study in which rabbits givenintravenous injections of phenylhydrazine showed blood and liver effects.The evidence of phenylhydrazine's possible carcinogenicity was also citedby WISH as additional support for a more stringent limit. In response,OSHA notes that the Agency is also concerned about the evidence for theseadverse effects of phenylhydrazine exposure and will continue to monitorand evaluate the toxicologic literature on phenylhydrazine to determinewhether there is a need in the future for a further reduction in the occupationalexposure limit. However, at the present time, OSHA is retaining the 5-ppm 8-hour TWA andadding a 10-ppm STEL for phenylhydrazine; the skin notation is also retained.The Agency concludes that these two limits will work together to keep workplaceexposures well controlled and will reduce the significant health risksassociated with exposure to this substance. These risks include acute blood-relatedtoxicity and may also include cancer; these effects clearly constitutematerial impairments of health. OSHA finds that the TWA and STEL limitsestablished in the final rule will substantially reduce these significantrisks. <ITAG tagnum="71">PHENYLPHOSPHINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 638-21-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>PH<T2>2 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1318</ITAG>OSHA had no former requirement for limiting worker exposure to phenyl phosphine;NIOSH also has no REL for this substance. The ACGIH has recommended a ceilinglimit of 0.05 ppm for this solid. The proposed PEL was a ceiling of 0.05ppm; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table NI) concurred with the proposed limit, andthis limit is established in the final rule. A 90-day inhalation study conducted by the du Pont Company, in which ratsand beagle dogs were exposed to average concentrations of 0.6 ppm or 2.2ppm phenylphosphine for six hours per day, five days per week, showed thatrats exposed to 2.2 ppm had significant hematologic changes and testiculardegeneration (E.I. du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co., Inc. 1970, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 479). These effects were not noted among rats exposedto 0.6 ppm, but rats exposed at the lower level did show hypersensitivityto sound and touch and mild hyperemia. The dogs tolerated the higher exposurelevel better than the rats in that some regeneration of testicular damageoccurred in dogs during a one-month recovery period. Dogs exposed to 0.6ppm exhibited intermittent nausea, diarrhea, lacrimation, and hind legtremor (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3). The ACGIH considered 0.6 ppm to be an NOElevel for severe effects in animals and recommended a 0.05-ppm ceilingTLV to provide a tenfold safety margin to protect workers against the changesexhibited by the test animals at the 0.6-ppm level. No comments other thanthat from NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) were received by OSHA. OSHA concludes that workers formerly exposed to uncontrolled levels ofphenylphosphine were at significant risk of experiencing the nausea, irritation,and CNS effects found to be associated with such exposures in animals.OSHA finds that these effects constitute material health impairments. TheAgency concludes that the final rule's ceiling of 0.05 ppm will reducethese significant risks substantially. <ITAG tagnum="71">PHOSPHINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7803-51-2; Chemical Formula: PH<T2>3 </T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposal retained the8-hour TWA of 0.3 ppm and added a STEL of 1 ppm. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) concurredwith this proposal. These limits are established in the final rule. Phosphineis a colorless gas with a disagreeable, garlic-like odor. Early studies reported that laboratory animals could tolerate phosphinein four-hour-daily exposures of 5 ppm for two months, but fatalities wereobserved from seven similar exposures at 10 ppm (Muller 1940/Ex. 1-919).In 1975, Waritz and Brown (Ex. 1-451) reported a 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> of 11 ppm in rats; these lethal exposures caused effects typicalof respiratory irritation. Prior to 1958, numerous cases of phosphine-related occupational poisoningsand deaths were reported, including a fatality caused by pulmonary edemathat was attributed to an exposure of 8 ppm for two hours daily (Hargerand Spolyar 1958/Ex. 1-327). Sublethal symptoms (without chronic effects)occurred at phosphine exposures averaging 10 ppm or less, with excursionsof up to 35 ppm; recorded symptoms included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting,respiratory distress, and dizziness (Jones, Jones, and Longley 1964/Ex.1-420). The literature contains no documented reports of chronic poisoningcaused by prolonged exposure to phosphine, although several authoritieshave asserted that this is a possibility (Henderson and Haggard 1943e/Ex.1-1086; Fairhall 1957h, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 883; Johnstoneand Miller 1960/Ex. 1-1114; Patty 1963f, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 883; American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) 1964/Ex. 1-407).Joel Carr, Health and Safety Research Director for the American Federationof Grain Millers Union, testified on the toxicology of and employee exposuresto phosphine in grain elevators and flour mills (Ex. 8-1; Tr. pp. 7-240to 7-259). Mr. Carr described a report of a group of industrial hygienestudies published by NIOSH (Zaebst 1986; Zaebst, Blade, Morelli-Schrothet al. 1987; Zaebst, Blade, Burroughs et al. 1988), in which applicatorsof phosphine were found to be exposed above the proposed TWA PEL and STEL;nonapplicator workers also become exposed while working near fumigatedgrain, while loading or transferring fumigated grain, or while workingin elevators and mills. Mr. Carr also cited additional health studies, including a report of chronicneurological problems following an acute episode of phosphine poisoning(Kurzbauer and Keise 1987), animal data indicating that phosphine inhibitscatalase activity (Price and Walter 1987), and studies showing phosphineto be mutagenic both <T3>in vitro </T3>and <T3>in vivo </T3>(<T3>Occupational/Environmental Pathology Review </T3>1988) (Tr. p. 7-246;Ex. 45A). He cited another NIOSH report (<T3>Studies of the Prevalence of Chronic, Non-Specific Lung Disease andRelated Health Problems in the Grain Handling Industry, </T3>Rankin etal. 1986) that identified several symptoms associated with phosphine exposure,including headaches, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, and dyspnea, as wellas palpable abdomen (Tr. p. 7-247). Mr. Carr also mentioned the preliminaryresults of an NCI mortality study of grain workers in which elevated relativerisks were found for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Tr. p. 7-254). Mr. Carr urgedOSHA to adopt a short-term limit of 0.3 ppm, which is consistent with EPA'sMaximum Concentration Limit for phosphine applicators (Tr. p. 7-250); inaddition, he recommended that OSHA establish provisions for exposure andmedical monitoring, training, and respiratory protection for phosphine.OSHA appreciates the information supplied by Mr. Carr on phosphine toxicityand awaits completion of the ongoing studies discussed by him at the hearing.In response to Mr. Carr's request that OSHA establish other requirementsin addition to the PEL, OSHA notes that the Agency is currently conductingrulemaking activities to develop generic standards for respiratory protection,medical surveillance, and exposure monitoring, but that the sole purposeof this rulemaking is to revise OSHA's outdated exposure limits. In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA PEL for phosphine of0.3 ppm and adding a 15-minute STEL of 1 ppm. The Agency concludes thatboth of these limits are required to substantially reduce the significantrisk of lung damage, diarrhea, and nausea, all material health impairmentsassociated with elevated short-term and long-term exposure to this gas.<ITAG tagnum="71">PIPERAZINE DIHYDROCHLORIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 142-64-3; Chemical Formula: C<T2>4</T2>H<T2>10</T2>N<T2>2</T2> 2 HCl </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Piperazine dihydrochloride is a water-soluble solid with low systemic toxicityand mild irritant properties; the compound is biologically active. Theoral LD<T2>50 </T2>for rats has been reported as 4.9 g/kg (NIOSH 1984, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 491). Eye and skin irritation have been reported as a result of human exposuresto high (not further specified) levels of piperazine dihydrochloride; subjectsexperienced mild to moderate skin burns and sensitization. Inhalation ofthe dust has been associated with asthmatic reactions (Dow Chemical Company1977h, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 491). OSHA received no commentsother than that from NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) on this substance. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a limit of 5 mg/m3 as an 8-hourTWA for piperazine dihydrochloride.

NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) concurred with these proposed limits,and these limits are established in the final rule. n-Propyl nitrate isa pale yellow liquid with a sickly sweet odor. Rats inhaling propyl nitrate vapor for four hours at a concentration of10,000 ppm exhibited cyanosis and methemoglobinemia before they died (Hood1953, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 505). The intravenous LD<T2>50</T2> in unanesthetized rabbits has been reported to be between 200and 250 mg/kg; in anesthetized dogs and cats, intravenous doses of between100 and 200 mg/kg were usually fatal (Murtha, Stabile, and Wills 1956/Ex.1-649). Murtha and associates (1956/Ex. 1-649), who conducted these studies,concluded that n-propyl nitrate exerts a direct action on the vascularsmooth muscle and that the ensuing cardiac effects and respiratory depressioncontribute to the compound's hypotensive action (Murtha, Stabile, and Wills1956/Ex. 1-649). Inhalation trials in mice, rats, hamsters, guinea pigs,and dogs have established 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> values ranging from 9000 to 10,000 ppm for rats, 6000 to 7000ppm for mice, and 2000 to 2500 ppm for dogs. Dogs survived repeated exposures(six hours/day, five days/week) at 260 ppm for six months, although slightclinical signs were observed during the first two weeks of exposure (Rinehart,Garbers, Greene, and Stoufer 1958/Ex. 1-524). The percutaneous toxicityof n-propyl nitrate is low but may cause inflammation and thickening ofthe skin after repeated exposures; these effects are sometimes transient(ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 505). To protect against cardiovascular and respiratorydepressant effects requires both TWA and STEL limits. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47)was the only commenter to the rulemaking record for this substance. In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the PEL of 25 ppm TWA and adding aSTEL of 40 ppm for n-propyl nitrate.

Sodium fluoroacetate causes vomiting, convulsions, and ventricular fibrillation.It is highly toxic by inhalation, ingestion, or via absorption throughthe skin (<T3>Occupational Health Guidelines for Chemical Hazards</T3>, NIOSH/OSHA1981). The ACGIH calculated and set the threshold limit of 0.05 mg/m3 basedon studies of rats indicating an oral LD<T2>50</T2> of 1.7 mg/kg (Lehman 1951/Ex. 1-790). Tissue changes in ratswere noted in a later study by the same author in which the animals werefed 0.25 mg sodium fluoroacetate/kg/day (Lehman 1952, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 534); the equivalent level in humans would be 17 mg/person/day.A further study by Miller and Phillips (1955, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 534) examined growth rates in rats fed various dosages of sodiumfluoroacetate. Rats who received 10 ppm in their diet experienced a transientfluctuation in growth rate. At 20 ppm (approximately 2 mg/kg in young rats),the growth rate declined markedly the first week; the rats survived andresumed growth at the normal rate in three to four weeks. Tolerance forthe chemical lasted less than two weeks, and those rats who had adjustedto sodium fluoroacetate showed a second retardation of growth when returnedto a dietary level of 20 ppm after a two-week interval of eating a normaldiet. Miller and Phillips (1955, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 534)noted that rats conditioned to a dietary level of 20 ppm were then ableto adjust to a level of 40 ppm (a dose that is greater than the singleLD<T2>50</T2> dose per day). The comment from NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) was the onlyone made to the record on sodium fluoroacetate. In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA of 0.05 mg/m3 and addinga STEL of 0.15 mg/m3 for sodium fluoroacetate; the skin notation is alsoretained. The Agency concludes that the 8-hour TWA and short-term exposurelimits, with a skin notation, will reduce the risk of systemic effectspossible as a result of short-term exposures above the 8-hour TWA of 0.05mg/m3. <ITAG tagnum="71">TRIMETHYLBENZENE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 25551-13-7; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>3</T2>C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposedPEL was 25 ppm as an 8-hour TWA; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred withthe 25-ppm TWA limit, and the final rule establishes this limit for thisliquid.A study by Battig, Grandjean, and Turrian (1957/Ex. 1-104) provides thebasis for the final rule's limit; this work reports symptoms among 27 workersexposed to a solvent containing 30 percent 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene and 50percent 1,2,3-trimethylbenzene. A ``significant number'' of these workerswere reported to have experienced symptoms of nervousness, tension andanxiety, and asthmatic bronchitis. The peripheral blood of these workers``showed a tendency to hypochromic anemia'' and a somewhat abnormal clottingability. This group of workers had been occupationally exposed to totalhydrocarbon concentrations ranging from 10 to 60 ppm for several years.The authors of the study recommended maintaining employee exposures below35 ppm (Battig, Grandjean, and Turrian 1957/Ex. 1-104). No comments otherthan that from NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) were received on this substance. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 25-ppm 8-hour PEL to reduce thesignificant risks of bronchitis and blood effects reported to occur inexposed workers. <ITAG tagnum="71">TUNGSTEN AND COMPOUNDS (INSOLUBLE) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-33-7; Chemical Formula: W </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH has established 5 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA and 10mg/m3as a short-term exposure limit for these substances. NIOSH recommends alimit of 5 mg/m3 as a 10-hour TWA. The proposed PEL for this group of substanceswas 5 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA and 10 mg/m3 as a 15-minute STEL. NIOSH (Ex.8-47) concurred with OSHA's proposed limits. The final rule promulgatesa 5-mg/m3 8-hour TWA and a 10-mg/m3 5-minute STEL, measured as tungsten.Tungsten is a gray, hard metal. Rats fed a diet containing 0.5 percent insoluble tungsten compounds died,and another group of rats fed 0.1 percent of these compounds suffered noticeableweight loss (Kinard and Van de Erve 1941/Ex. 1-492). Studies in rats fedtungsten at 2, 5, or 10 percent of their diet showed that females in alldose groups had a 15-percent reduction in weight gain (Kinard and Van deErve 1943/Ex. 1-493). The intraperitoneal LD<T2>50 </T2>for tungsten metal powder in rats was 5 g/kg body weight; survivorsshowed minor liver and spleen changes at necropsy (Fredrick and Bradley1946, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 614). Studies of the tissues ofguinea pigs intratracheally injected with tungsten metal and tungsten carbiderevealed moderate interstitial cellular proliferation and no changes, respectively.However, Soviet studies involving similar intratracheal injections showedproliferation of the intra-alveolar septa (Kaplun and Mezentseva 1960,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 614). The NIOSH criteria document fortungsten (1977h, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 614) reports that Russianinvestigators found a 9- to 11-percent incidence of pulmonary fibrosisin workers exposed to tungsten (Kaplun and Mezentseva 1959/Ex. 1-961; andMezentseva 1967, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 614). NIOSH (1977h)recommended that the standard for tungsten and its insoluble compoundsbe set at 5 mg/m3 to protect against pulmonary effects. Stokinger (in <T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology, </T3>3rd rev. ed., Vol.2A, Clayton and Clayton 1981) reported on several epidemiological studiesof workers in the ``hard metal industry,'' in which tungsten carbide ismachined. These studies describe a condition known as hard metal disease,which may be accompanied by pulmonary fibrosis. The disease is characterizedby a moderate incidence of cough, dyspnea, and wheezing, a high incidenceof minor radiological abnormalities with a few instances of marked abnormalities,and development of hypersensitivity asthma in some workers (which may bedue to exposure to the cobalt that is used as a binding agent). The diseaseis progressive and potentially lethal. Stokinger (in <T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology, </T3>3rd rev. ed., Vol.2A, Clayton and Clayton 1981, p. 1992) reported that, unlike other lungdiseases produced by inorganic dust, there is no correlation between onsetof symptoms, length of exposure, and the development of interstitial fibrosis.Analysis of the lung of one worker who had clinical signs and radiologicalchanges showed the presence of large amounts of tungsten with much smalleramounts of other metals. Mr. H.K. Thompson, Corporate Industrial Hygiene Manager for Caterpillar,Inc. (Ex. 3-349), questioned the need for a STEL for tungsten. OSHA believesthat, given the potential seriousness of hard metal disease and the uncertaintiesregarding the relationship between exposure and response, a short-termlimit for tungsten will provide additional assurance that the 8-hour TWAPEL is not exceeded. Therefore, in accordance with OSHA's policy for establishingSTELs in this rulemaking (see Section IV.C.17, OSHA finds that a STEL fortungsten is necessary. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 5 mg/m3 and aSTEL of 10 mg/m3 for tungsten and its insoluble compounds, measured astungsten. The Agency concludes that these limits will substantially reducethe significant risk of pulmonary fibrosis and other lung effects, whichconstitute material impairments of health that are associated with exposureto this metal and its insoluble compounds at levels above the new PELs.<ITAG tagnum="71">TUNGSTEN AND COMPOUNDS (SOLUBLE) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-33-7; Chemical Formula: W </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1417</ITAG>OSHA had no former limit for exposure to tungsten and its soluble compounds.The ACGIH limit is 1 mg/m3 TWA, with a 3-mg/m3 STEL, measured as tungsten.NIOSH recommends a 1-mg/m3 10-hour TWA for tungsten and its soluble compounds.OSHA proposed an 8-hour TWA PEL of 1 mg/m3 and a 15-minute STEL of 3 mg/m3;NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with the addition of a STEL to the1-mg/m3 TWA limit. The final rule establishes limits of 1 mg/m3 as an 8-hourTWA and 3 mg/m3 as a 15-minute STEL, measured as tungsten. Tungsten isa grey, hard metal.Animal studies have shown that the LD<T2>50</T2> for soluble sodium tungstate when injected subcutaneously inrats ranges from 140 to 160 mg/kg (Kinard and Van de Erve 1940/Ex. 1-788).Soluble tungsten's lethal effects are the result of systemic poisoningthat occurs as the compound is absorbed by multiple organs; this is followedby cellular asphyxiation (International Labour Office [ILO] 1934c, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 614). Karantassis (1924, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 614) also observed a systemic response in guinea pigs given solublesodium tungstate or pure soluble tungsten either orally or intravenously;the animals developed anorexia, colic, trembling, and difficulty in breathingprior to death. Rats fed a diet containing 0.5 percent tungsten as solublesodium tungstate or tungsten oxide died from this dose. Dietary doses of0.1 percent tungsten oxide and the sodium salt caused weight loss in rats,but no deaths (Kinard and Van de Erve 1941/Ex. 1-492). Tungsten is believedto act by antagonizing the action of molybdenum (Higgins, Richert, andWesterfield 1956/Ex. 1-487). In its criteria document for tungsten (1977h,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 614), NIOSH states that informationon the effects of exposure to soluble tungsten compounds in the workingpopulation is not available. The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 614) recommendsa lower TLV for the soluble, as compared to the insoluble, compounds oftungsten because of the former's greater systemic toxicity. No commentsother than those of NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) were received on this substance. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 1 mg/m3 and aSTEL of 3 mg/m3 for tungsten and its soluble compounds, measured as tungsten.The Agency concludes that these limits will protect workers against thesignificant risks of systemic toxicity, anorexia, colic, incoordination,trembling, and dyspnea, all of which constitute material health impairmentsthat are associated with exposure to these compounds at levels above thenew PELs. <ITAG tagnum="71">VINYLIDENE CHLORIDE (1,1-DICHLOROETHYLENE) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-35-4; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>= CCl<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1428</ITAG>Previously, OSHA's Z tables did not include a limit for vinylidene chloride(VDC). The ACGIH has established 5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 20 ppm as a15-minute STEL. NIOSH and OSHA, in 1978, jointly recommended that employeeexposure to VDC be reduced to the lowest feasible level on the basis ofVDC's carcinogenicity (NIOSH/OSHA 1978/Ex. 1-1119). OSHA proposed a PELof 5 ppm (8-hour TWA) and a STEL of 20 ppm. However, in response to recordcomments, the final rule promulgates a 1-ppm limit as an 8-hour TWA. Vinylidenechloride is a colorless liquid that polymerizes readily. The acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> for male rats is 2500 mg/kg (Jenkins, Trabulus, and Murphy1972/Ex. 1-960). The LC<T2>50</T2> for rats exposed to a single four-hour exposure of VDC vaporwas reported as 6350 ppm in one study (Siegel, Jones, Coon, and Lyon 1971/Ex.1-371) and 32,000 ppm in an earlier study (Carpenter, Smyth, and Pozzani1949/Ex. 1-722). Liquid VDC causes transient irritation to the eyes ofrats but has little effect on exposed skin if the VDC is allowed to evaporate(Torkelson and Rowe 1981b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 628). Prendergast and co-workers (1967/Ex. 1-926) exposed rats, rabbits, guineapigs, and monkeys eight hours/day, five days/week for six weeks to 395mg/m3 (100 ppm); these authors saw no visible signs of toxicity while theexposure was in process, but rabbits and monkeys lost weight. These samespecies were exposed continuously to VDC concentrations of 5, 15, 25, or47 ppm for 90 days; only the animals exposed to 5 ppm showed no increasesin mortality (Prendergast, Jones, Jenkins, and Siegel 1967/Ex. 1-926).Nasal irritation, liver cell degeneration, and retarded weight gain werereported in rats following 20 six-hour exposures to 500 ppm VDC (Gage 1970/Ex.1-318); at 200 ppm, only nasal irritation occurred. Studies by Torkelsonand Rowe (1981b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 628) in which rats,rabbits, guinea pigs, and dogs were exposed to 25, 50, or 100 ppm VDC foreight hours per day, five days per week for six months revealed injuryof the kidneys and liver in all animals at all levels of exposure. Maltoni(1977/Ex. 1-985) and Maltoni, Cotti, Morisi, and Chieco (1977/Ex. 1-1090)conducted an evaluation of VCD's carcinogenicity in which mice, rats andhamsters were exposed to levels from 10 to 150 ppm for four hours per day,five days per week for 52 weeks, with results reported through week 98of the study. In those mice exposed to 25 ppm VCD, 21 percent of the malesand 1.5 percent of the females developed kidney adenocarcinomas; thesetumors were not seen in rats exposed to amounts of VDC up to 150 ppm. Exposuresof 100 or 150 ppm in rats did produce a significant increase in mammaryadenocarcinomas, and this response was dose-related (Maltoni 1977/Ex. 1-985;Maltoni, Cotti, Morisi, and Chieco 1977/Ex. 1-1090). Overt toxicity andmortality occurred early in the studies after four-hour exposures at levelsof 50 ppm in mice and 200 ppm in rats; hamsters exposed to 20 ppm VDC showedno increase in tumor incidence (Maltoni 1977/Ex. 1-985; Maltoni, Cotti,Morisi, and Chieco 1977/Ex. 1-1090). A study by Murray, Nitschke, Rampy, and Schwetz (1979/Ex. 1-920) investigatedthe embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic effects of inhaled and ingestedVDC (in rats) and inhaled VDC (in rabbits). In the inhalation studies,rats were exposed to 20, 80, or 160 ppm VDC for seven hours per day. VDCwas toxic to both the adults and their embryos at levels of 80 and 160ppm among the rats, and at 160 ppm in rabbits. At exposure levels of 20ppm in rats and 80 ppm in rabbits, neither maternal toxicity nor effectson embryonic or fetal development were noted. In the ingestion study withrats, drinking water containing 200 ppm VDC caused no toxic effects ineither the rats or their offspring. Two strains of rats exposed to 75 or 100 ppm VDC for five days/week, sixhours/day for 12 months did not show a significant increase in tumors (Violaand Caputo 1977/Ex. 1-937). Other investigators exposed rats to 25 or 75ppm by inhalation for six hours/day, five days/week for 18 months, or to60, 100, or 200 ppm VDC in their drinking water for two years, and foundno increase in tumor incidence in these animals (Rampy, Quast, Humistonet al. 1977, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 628). In mice, VDC wasnot active either as a whole mouse skin carcinogen or by subcutaneous injection.In other studies, VDC proved mutagenic in both <T3>E. coli </T3>and <T3>S. </T3><T3>typhimurium </T3>strains (Greim, Bonse, Radwan et al. 1975/Ex. 1-904;Bartsch, Malaveille, Montesano, and Tomatis 1975/Ex. 1-889). VDC has beenimplicated as a tumor initiator in a carcinogenesis bioassay by Van Duuren,Goldschmidt, Loewengart et al. (1979/Ex. 1-936). Studies by Reitz, Watanabe,McKenna et al. (1980/Ex. 1-927) suggest that VCD's tumorigenicity is aresult of its ability to initiate cell injury, rather than of its abilityto alter the genetic material of an injured cell. However, VDC has beenshown to alkylate DNA <T3>in situ</T3> and increase the rate of DNA repair to a small extentin mice (Norris and Reitz 1984/Ex. 134B). The actual cell injury is causedby VDC metabolites, which are highly reactive and cytotoxic (Maltoni 1977/Ex.1-985; Hathway 1977/Ex. 1-906; Henschler and Bonse 1977/Ex. 1-908). A cohort study of 138 VCD-exposed workers did not identify any VCD-relatedhealth effects in these workers (Ott, Fishbeck, Townsend, and Schneider1976/Ex. 1-924). The cohort was too small to provide any evidence thatVDC is not likely to be carcinogenic. The Chemical Manufacturers Association submitted the results of an NTPgavage study of VDC in mice and rats (NTP 1982/Ex. 134B). The only observedsignificant increase in tumor incidence occurred in low-dose female mice;this increase was not considered to be related to VDC administration becausesimilar effects were not observed in high-dose female mice, male mice,or rats. The NTP (1982/Ex. 134B) concluded that VDC was not carcinogenicin mice or rats exposed by gavage, but cautioned that a maximum tolerateddose had not been demonstrated and that previously reported studies hadshown that carcinogenicity is associated with VDC inhalation by animals.Based on the carcinogenicity evidence described above, NIOSH (Ex. 8-47,Table N6B) indicated that VDC is a suitable candidate for an individual6(b) rulemaking. However, the CMA (Ex. 165) was of the opposite opinion,stating that the demonstrated lack of tumor response in most studies, coupledwith evidence that VDC metabolism is species-specific, ``demonstrates thatVDC is unlikely to pose an oncogenic risk to humans'' (Ex. 165, p. 42).CMA also objected to the statement by NIOSH and OSHA in the joint <T3>Current Intelligence Bulletin on VDC </T3>(NIOSH/OSHA 1978/Ex. 1-1119)that VDC be considered a potential carcinogen because of its structuralsimilarity to vinyl chloride; the CMA considered this statement inappropriate,given the toxicity data available. Matthew Gillen and Scott Schneider of the Workers Institute for Safetyand Health (WISH) commented that the proposed 5-ppm PEL and 20-ppm STELfor VDC would not provide sufficient protection from systemic effects (Ex.116). They pointed out that the study by Prendergast et al. (1967/Ex. 1-926)found 15 ppm to be the lowest effect level for increased mortality in animals,and that the Torkelson and Rowe (1981b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 628) study found liver and kidney injury in animals. These commentersstated that the ``ACGIH TLV cannot be considered to provide adequate protectionfor this substance. Given this fact, OSHA should consider the NIOSH RELof 1 ppm as an interim value until further risk assessment studies canbe carried out'' (Ex. 116). OSHA has re-examined the health evidence in light of the comment by WISH,and has determined that the proposed 5-ppm TWA PEL for VDC does not affordworkers sufficient protection from systemic effects. Although it is questionable,in the Prendergast et al. (1967/Ex. 1-926) study, that the observed deathsat lower exposure levels were compound-related, histopathologic examinationof animals exposed to 47 ppm showed treatment-related liver and kidneydamage. Using an exposure regimen similar to occupational exposure (i.e.,eight hours/day, five days/week), Torkelson and Rowe (1981b, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 628) demonstrated kidney and liver toxicity in fourspecies of animals after exposure to VDC levels as low as 25 ppm were administeredfor only six months. OSHA believes that these studies clearly demonstrate that VDC can causeadverse liver and kidney damage at airborne concentrations as low as 25to 50 ppm and suggest that VDC is a potential occupational carcinogen.Liver and kidney damage and cancer clearly constitute material health impairmentswithin the meaning of the Act. Therefore, OSHA concludes that the proposedlimits of 5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 20 ppm as a STEL will not sufficientlyprotect workers from the significant risk of organ damage, and that a furtherreduction in the PEL is warranted. Accordingly, OSHA is establishing a1-ppm 8-hour TWA limit for vinylidene chloride in the final rule.<ITAG tagnum="71">WELDING FUMES </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: None; Chemical Formula: Not available </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1430</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no limit for exposure to welding fumes, which are definedas fumes that are generated by the manual metal arc or oxy-acetylene weldingof iron, mild steel, or aluminum. The ACGIH has set an 8-hour TWA of 5mg/m3 for these welding fumes, measured as total particulate in the welder'sbreathing zone. OSHA proposed an 8-hour TWA of 5 mg/m3 for these fumes;this limit is established in the final rule. This limit applies to thetotal fume concentration generated during the welding of iron, mild steel,or aluminum; the fumes generated by the welding of stainless steel, cadmium,or lead-coated steel, or other metals such as copper, nickel, or chromeare considerably more toxic and should be kept at or below the levels requiredby their respective PELs. Welding fumes consist of metallic oxides generatedby the heating of metal being welded, the welding rod, or its coatings.Although these types of welding generally produce fumes consisting of aluminum,iron, or zinc oxides, other toxic gases may also be produced in large amounts(Ferry and Ginther 1952/Ex. 1-900; Ferry 1954/Ex. 1-782; Silverman 1956/Ex.1-1169; Homer and Mohr 1957/Ex. 1-787). The welding of iron metals maygive off fumes of manganese, silicate, and various organic binders. Aluminumwelding may generate fumes consisting of fluorine, arsenic, copper, silicon,and beryllium (NIOSH 1975h and American Welding Society 1974, both as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 634). Eighteen different substances, includingfluoride, manganese, silicon, titanium, and sodium and potassium silicates,have been measured in the fumes resulting from the welding of mild steel(ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 634). Excessive exposure to welding fume can cause a variety of disorders, mostnotably metal fume fever. It has been estimated that 30 to 40 percent ofall welders have experienced metal fume fever at some time (Abraham 1983,in <T3>Environmental and Occupational Medicine, </T3>W.N. Rom, ed., p. 146).This disorder, which results from exposure to freshly formed metal fume,results in the appearance of delayed, flu-like symptoms, including dyspnea,coughing, pains in muscles and joints, fever, and chills. Recovery usuallyrequires one or two days of time away from work. In addition to fume fever,exposure to welding fume may damage the small airways, causing interstitialpneumonia (Abraham 1983). Several commenters, the American Iron and Steel Institute (Exs. 129, 188),the Abbott Laboratories (Tr. 9-155 to 9-156), and the American WeldingSociety (Ex. 3-860), were of the opinion that OSHA's discussion of weldingfumes in the NPRM was not clear with regard to whether the limit appliedto exposure samples taken inside or outside of the welding helmet. OSHAwishes to clarify that welding fume is to be measured in the breathingzone of the welder; the specific details of the appropriate positioningof the sampler should be determined on the basis of guidance in the <T3>Field Operations Manual </T3>(OSHA 1984). This is consistent with apast OSH Review Commission decision (8 OSHRC 1049). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) stated at the hearing that welding fumes should be designatedas a carcinogen. This view was also endorsed by Dr. James Melium, of theNew York State Department of Health (Tr. p. 11-104). In response to thesecommenters, OSHA notes that there are few data sufficient to establisha-dose-response for the fumes. Accordingly, OSHA believes it would be prematureto identify these fumes as potential occupational carcinogens. OSHA concludes that a PEL for welding fumes is needed to protect workersinvolved in the welding of aluminum, iron, or mild steel from the significantrisk of metal fume fever and respiratory irritation associated with thegeneration of welding fumes. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing aTWA of 5 mg/m3 for these particular types of welding fumes, measured astotal particulate inside the welder's breathing zone. The Agency findsthat this limit will substantially reduce the significant risk of materialhealth impairment to which manual metal arc or oxy-acetylene welders ofiron, mild steel, or aluminum were previously exposed in the absence ofany OSHA limit. <ITAG tagnum="71">ZINC OXIDE (FUME) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1314-13-2; Chemical Formula: ZnO </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1437</ITAG>OSHA's former exposure limit for zinc oxide fume was 5 mg/m3 as an 8-hourTWA. The ACGIH recommends a 5-mg/m3 TWA and also has a STEL of 10 mg/m3.NIOSH recommends a 5-mg/m3 10-hour TWA limit with a 15-minute ceiling of15 mg/m3. OSHA proposed to retain the 5-mg/m3 8-hour TWA and to add a STELof 10 mg/m3, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table Nl) concurs with this proposal.The final rule establishes these limits. When heated, zinc oxide producesa white fume.The most prevalent toxic effect of zinc oxide fume is a condition knownas ``metal fume fever,'' whose symptoms include chills, fever, muscularpain, nausea, and vomiting (Turner and Thompson 1926/Ex. 1-1124). Studiesin the workplace have shown that welders exposed to zinc oxide fume atconcentrations of 320 to 580 mg/m3 reported nausea, with the developmentof chills, shortness of breath, and severe chest pains 2 to 12 hours later.Most workers took approximately 4 days to recover, and some eventuallydeveloped pneumonia (Hammond 1944/Ex. 1-981). Other studies have reportedthe frequent occurrence of chills in workers exposed to zinc oxide at levelsas low as 5 mg/m3 (Hickish 1963 and Wall 1970, both as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 645). Hammond (1944/Ex. 1-981) reported that workers exposed to8 to 12 mg/m3 of zinc oxide fume did not suffer from metal fume fever.Zinc oxide exposures of guinea pigs that lasted only an hour caused a dropin body temperature, followed 6 to 18 hours later by an increase abovenormal levels (Turner and Thompson 1926/Ex. 1-1124). The animals in thehigh-exposure group (2500 mg/m3 for three to four hours) died after exposure.Early studies (Drinker, Thomson, and Finn 1927/Ex. 1-356) suggested thatmetal fume fever was unlikely to occur at concentrations below 15 mg/m3,but subsequent experience shows that exposures even at 5 mg/m3 can causethis syndrome (Hickish 1963 and Wall 1970, both as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 646). NIOSH's criteria document (1975d, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 645)reported that the development of metal fume fever was unlikely at levelsas low as 5 mg/m3, but the Institute stated that exposures to the fumeat this level could cause chronic respiratory effects. Dr. Lawrence Hecker,representing Abbott Laboratories (Ex. 3-678), objected to a STEL for zincoxide fume. However, in both its criteria document (1975d) and post-hearingtestimony (Ex. 150, Comments on Zinc Oxide Fume), NIOSH indicated thata short-term limit is necessary to ``prevent pathological tissue changesin the lung from acute exposure.'' Therefore, OSHA finds that a STEL forzinc oxide fume is necessary to prevent or minimize these effects. In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 5-mg/m3 8-hour TWA and addinga STEL of 10 mg/m3. The Agency concludes that both of these limits willprotect workers from the significant risk of metal fume fever, which constitutesa material health impairment that is associated with acute and chronicexposure to zinc oxide fumes. <ITAG tagnum="71">ZIRCONIUM COMPOUNDS </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-67-7; Chemical Formula: Zr </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1439</ITAG>The former OSHA limit for zirconium compounds was an 8-hour TWA of 5 mg/m3,measured as zirconium. The ACGIH has established a TLV-TWA of 5 mg/m3,supplemented by a 10-mg/m3 STEL, (as Zr). The proposal retained the 8-hourTWA but added a STEL of 10 mg/m3; these limits are promulgated by the finalrule. Zirconium compounds may be either bluish-black powders or grayish-whitelustrous metals. The toxic effects of inhalation exposures to zirconium compounds includethe formation of granulomas, both in the lungs and on the skin. Sax (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>6th ed., 1984) reportscases of pulmonary granulomas in workers exposed to zirconium aerosols.In laboratory animals, oral toxicity is low (NIOSH 1972b, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 647), and inhalation studies conducted for one year atlevels of 3.5 mg zirconium/m\3\ dust and mist resulted in limited toxicity(Stokinger 1981c/Ex. 1-1134). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) recommended that zirconium tetrachloride should not beincluded among the compounds for which the proposed zirconium PEL is applied.NIOSH cites an animal study by Spiegl et al. (1956, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 647), in which a 60-day exposure to zirconium tetrachloride ata concentration of 6 mg/m3 (six hours/day, five days/week) resulted inincreased mortality in rats and guinea pigs and a decrease ``of borderlinesignificance'' in blood hemoglobin and red blood cell levels in dogs. Giventhat the observed effect level for mortality of 6 mg/m3 is close to theproposed 5-mg/m3 limit, NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) stated that a separate PEL shouldbe considered for zirconium tetrachloride. At this time, OSHA is establishing the PELs as proposed for all zirconiumcompounds, including zirconium tetrachloride. There are no reports, otherthan the one cited by NIOSH, that indicate that exposure to zirconium compoundscauses severe toxicity at levels near the proposed 5-mg/m3 TWA PEL; inaddition, the toxic reaction of dogs exposed to 6 mg/m was of borderlinesignificance. OSHA concludes that the 5-mg/m3 TWA and 10-mg/m3 STEL limits for the zirconiumcompounds, measured as zirconium, will protect workers from the significantrisk of pulmonary effects potentially associated with the short-term exposurespermitted by the 8-hour TWA alone. The Agency has determined that theseeffects constitute material health impairments. Conclusions for This Group of Systemic Toxicants For the group of systemic toxicants shown on Table C8-1, OSHA concludesthat the risks associated with occupational exposures are significant.As Table C8-2 shows, the systemic effects caused by such exposures includecancer, liver and kidney damage, testicular damage, fetal poisoning, centralnervous system depression, and asthma, each of which constitutes materialimpairment of health within the meaning of the Act. Affected employeesmay experience dizziness, nausea, generalized weakness, respiratory irritation,blood in the urine, chest tightness, hives, and necrosis of the cornea.These effects represent significant impairments of health and functionalcapacity, and reducing the limits for these systemic toxins will substantiallyreduce these significant risks.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on No-Observed Adverse-EffectLevels</ITAG>IntroductionFor a group of 23 toxic substances, OSHA is establishing limits based onevidence that these substances cause toxic responses at higher levels buthave been shown not to produce adverse effects in animals or exposed populationsat the permissible exposure limits being established. These substancesare shown in Table C9-1, along with their CAS numbers, H.S. numbers, andformer, proposed, and final rule limits. OSHA is establishing limits for17 chemicals in this group that have not formerly been regulated by theAgency. The Agency is retaining its 8-hour TWA PEL and adding a STEL fortwo substances, reducing the 8-hour TWA and adding a STEL in the case ofuranium (insoluble compounds), reducing the 8-hour TWA for one substance(petroleum distillates), and retaining the existing 8-hour TWA for twochemicals.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M003</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 932-934</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>Description of the Health EffectsThe substances included in this group cause a wide range of adverse healtheffects in both animals and humans. Unlike most of the other groupingsdescribed in this preamble, these toxicants do not affect the same targetorgan or system: some are central nervous system depressants, several areupper respiratory tract irritants, and still others have their primaryeffect on the heart, liver, and/or kidney.The commonality among these otherwise diverse substances is that apparentno-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAELs) have been defined for all ofthem; that is, there are data demonstrating that overt toxic effects causedby exposure to these substances at higher levels do not occur below a certain``no-observed-adverse-effect'' level. Permissible exposure limits havebeen developed for these chemicals on the basis of these ``no-observed-adverse-effect''levels. Table C9-2 shows the health effects observed in animals and observedor likely to occur in humans exposed to these substances.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 003</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 936-938</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>Dose-Response Relationships and No-Observed-Adverse-Effect LevelsThe concept of setting limits based on a NOAE level assumes that thereis a concentration at which repeated and prolonged exposure to a toxicsubstance causes no observable adverse effect in the majority of workers.A similar concept is widely used by a variety of Federal agencies, forexample the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental ProtectionAgency, to set contaminant tolerances, acceptable daily intake values,and other limits.All of the limits for these substances have been set at a no-observed-adverse-effector minimal effect level, regardless of the specific health endpoint beingprotected against. At least in part, the exposure limits for the 23 substanceslisted in Table C9-1 are based on data indicating that these limits arealready being maintained in work environments and that these levels areboth feasible and not likely to be associated with adverse health effectsor symptoms in employees. These limits will also protect against any effectsthese substances cause at higher concentrations. Even at relatively lowexposure concentrations, many of the substances in this group cause effectsthat can be severe and irreversible.The following discussions describe OSHA's findings and the record evidencefor the substances in this group and illustrate the material impairmentsof health faced by workers exposed to these toxicants in the workplace.<ITAG tagnum="71">ATRAZINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1912-24-9: Chemical Formula: C<T2>8</T2>H<T2>14</T2>CIN<T2>5</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1029</ITAG>Formerly, OSHA had no limit for atrazine; an 8-hour TWA of 5 mg/m3 wasproposed. The final rule establishes this limit, which is consistent withthat of the ACGIH. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs with this limit foratrazine. Atrazine is a stable, white, crystalline compound.Animal studies indicate that the oral toxicity of the s-triazine herbicides,of which atrazine is the best known, is relatively low. However, the ingestionof high doses can cause ataxia, dyspnea and convulsions in animals (ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 44). Rats, dogs, horses, or cattle fed dietary levelsof more than 25 ppm of atrazine for extended periods did not exhibit adverseeffects. The s-triazine herbicides are apparently excreted in urine andfeces within relatively short periods of time (Bakke, Larson, and Price1972/Ex. 1-950). The s-triazines appear to interfere with carbohydratemetabolism by blocking the production of sugars (Gysin 1962/Ex. 1-740;Gast 1958, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 44).There have not been reports of atrazine poisoning in exposed people (ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 44). Because there are no reports of human reactions toatrazine that can be correlated with airborne concentrations, the 5-mg/m3limit was set on the basis of animal studies. Long-term feeding studiesin dogs have established 3.75 mg/kg as the highest no-adverse-effect level(EPA 1979, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 44). Assuming that lung absorptionis less than 50 percent and applying a safety factor would yield an 8-hourTWA limit for humans of 5 mg/m3 (Zielhuis and van der Kreek 1979/Ex. 1-613).Wayne Bellinger, Corporate Safety Director of ConAgra, Inc., objected tothe establishment of permissible exposure limits on the basis of a ``no-adverse-effect''level (Ex. 3-635). In support of this position, ConAgra referred to theproposed limit for atrazine; according to ConAgra, PELs should not be set``where there are no reports of human reactions that can be attributedto air concentrations'' (Ex. 3-635, p. 2).OSHA believes that ConAgra has misunderstood the phrase ``no-observed-adverse-effectlevel'' as it is used in toxicology. As discussed in the Description ofthe Health Effects section, above, this term simply means a level belowwhich overt toxic effects have not been observed and above which they have.The use of a no-observed-adverse-effect level to establish ``acceptable''exposure levels, intake values, etc. is common, both in the health effectsliterature and in public health agencies; this approach is widely usedwith substances that have threshold effects. In addition, it is standardtoxicological practice to rely on animal data when human data are sparseor nonexistent, as is the case for atrazine. OSHA has reviewed the healtheffects evidence for this substance and finds the proposed rule's limitboth appropriate and necessary to protect against significant workplacerisk.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 5 mg/m3 foratrazine. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect employees fromthe significant risk of neuropathic and metabolic effects, which constitutematerial health impairments that are likely to occur at levels above thenew PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">BROMACIL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 314-40-9; Chemical Formula: C<T2>9</T2>H<T2>13</T2>BrN<T2>2</T2>O<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1041</ITAG>OSHA had no former permissible exposure limit for bromacil. The Agencyproposed an 8-hour TWA PEL of 1 ppm for this substance, which is consistentwith the ACGIH's TLV-TWA for bromacil. The final rule establishes a PELof 1 ppm for this substance: NIOSH concurs with OSHA's determination ofa PEL for bromacil (Ex. 8-47, Table N1). Bromacil is a white crystallinesolid.In two-year feeding studies in rats, no-observed-adverse-effect dietaryconcentrations were determined to be 12.55 mg/kg/day (1.25 ppm) for ratsand 1250 ppm for dogs; the oral LD<T2>50</T2> for male rats is 5200 mg/kg (Sherman and Kaplan 1975/Ex. 1-572).Inhalation studies in rats have shown that all rats tolerate a four-hourexposure to concentrations equivalent to 4800 mg/m3. Studies of guineapigs showed no skin sensitization but displayed skin irritation after exposuresat unspecified levels. Rabbits showed no clinical signs of toxicity whenbromacil was applied to the skin at a dose of 5000 mg/kg (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 64).OSHA received a comment on the proposed limit for bromacil from ConAgra,Inc. (Ex. 3-635), which is of the opinion that bromacil's exposure effectsdo not warrant the establishment of a PEL. OSHA notes, however, that ratsfed 1250 ppm (125 mg/kg/day) exhibited damage to the thyroid; the Agencyfinds that this evidence requires the establishment of a PEL at the 1-ppmlevel to protect workers exposed to this herbicide from experiencing thisand other potentially adverse systemic effects.OSHA is therefore establishing an 8-hour TWA permissible exposure limitfor 1 ppm for bromacil. The Agency concludes that this limit protect employeesagainst the significant risk of thyroid damage and irritation, which togetherconstitute material health impairments that are potentially associatedwith exposure to bromacil at levels above the new PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">p-tert-BUTYLTOLUENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 98-51-1; Chemical Formula: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">  (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>3</T2>C_C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>CH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1056</ITAG>OSHA formerly had an 8-hour TWA PEL of 10 ppm TWA for p-tert-butyl- toluene;the Agency proposed to retain this limit and to supplement it with a 20-ppmSTEL. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 10 ppm and a TLV-STEL of 20 ppm for thissubstance. The final rule adopts a STEL of 20 ppm to supplement OSHA's10-ppm 8-hour TWA PEL for p-tert-butyltoluene. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1)concurs with the selection of these limits. p-tert-Butyltoluene is a colorlessliquid with an aromatic, gasoline-like odor.p-tert-Butyltoluene has been shown to have varying degrees of toxicity,depending on route of administration. It is slightly toxic on ingestion,and minimally toxic through skin exposure, but moderately toxic when inhaled(Hine, Ungar, Anderson et al. 1954/Ex. 1-983). Repeated exposures in animalshave shown liver and kidney changes and microscopic degenerative hemorrhagesin the spinal cord and brain, even at relatively low concentrations. Thechief acute effects in animals are central nervous system depression andrespiratory irritation; in rats exposed for one to seven hours daily overa 26-week period, 25 ppm daily appeared to be the no-observed-adverse-effectlevel (Gerarde 1960a, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 85).In humans, Hine, Ungar, Anderson et al. (1954/Ex. 1-983) observed nasalirritation, nausea, malaise, headache, and weakness associated with exposureto p-tert-butyltoluene at unspecified levels. These authors also notedcardiovascular effects, as well as effects on the central nervous system,the skin, and the respiratory tract. Half of the subjects exposed to p-tert-butyltoluenedeveloped tremor and anxiety, and 25 percent of exposed individuals showedevidence of chemical contact irritation of the respiratory tract (Hine,Ungar, Anderson et al. 1954/Ex. 1-983).OSHA is retaining its 8-hour TWA of 10 ppm and adding a STEL of 20 ppmfor p-tert-butyltoluene. The Agency concludes that a STEL as well as aTWA will protect workers against the significant risks of central nervousand cardiovascular system effects, as well as those of irritation and nausea,all of which constitute material impairments to health that are potentiallyassociated with short-term (one to seven hours) exposures to this substanceat levels above the 8-hour TWA.<ITAG tagnum="71">CHLORODIFLUOROMETHANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-45-6: Chemical Formula: CHCIF<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1085 </ITAG>OSHA formerly had no limit for chlorodifluoromethane (Freon 22). The Agencyproposed an 8-hour TWA PEL of 1000 ppm, supplemented by a STEL of 1250ppm. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) supported this proposal. The ACGIH hasa TLV-TWA of 1000 ppm for this substance. In the final rule, OSHA is establishingan 8-hour TWA for chlorodifluoromethane of 1000 ppm; the Agency has decidednot to establish a STEL for chlorodifluoromethane (see Section VI.C.17)for a discussion of OSHA's rationale with regard to STELs in this rulemaking).Chlorodifluoromethane is a colorless, nearly odorless, nonflammable gas.Exposure to very high atmospheric levels of Freon 22 causes stimulationand then depression of the central nervous system, followed by asphyxiation.Rats and guinea pigs exposed to concentrations of 75,000 to 100,000 ppmover a two-hour period exhibited excitation and disequilibrium; narcosiswas observed at 200,000 ppm and mortality at 300,000 and 400,000 ppm (Weigand1971/Ex. 1-1102). In mice, similar exposures to 320,000 ppm were the maximumtolerated, and the minimum lethal dose was 370,000 ppm (Karpov 1963, ascited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 127). In rabbits, the minimum concentrationaltering reflex responses was 11,000 to 20,000 ppm (Karpov 1963, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 127). Studies of guinea pigs reported no fatalitiesas a result of exposure for two hours at 200,000 ppm, but mild clinicalchanges were observed at 50,000 ppm and minimal effects at 25,000 ppm (Underwriters'Laboratories, Inc. 1940, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1/3, p. 127). Thirty-minuteexposures at 500,000 ppm were lethal to guinea pigs (Booth and Bixby 1932/Ex.1-1079). Karpov (1963, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 127) also reportedthe results of a 10-month study of inhalation effects in rats, guinea pigs,dogs, and cats. Six-hour inhalation exposures to 14,000 ppm or 2000 ppmfor five days/week were studied, and alterations in weight, endurance,blood chemistry, and pathology of the lungs, central nervous system, heart,liver, kidney, and spleen were seen at the 14,000-ppm level in rats, mice,and rabbits. At the 2000-ppm daily inhalation level, rats and mice showedno effects (Karpov 1963, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 127). In dogs,cardiac sensitization was not observed at the 25,000-ppm level but didoccur at the 50,000-ppm level (Reinhardt, Azar, Maxfield, Smith, and Mullin1971/Ex. 1-78). No data have been published concerning the carcinogenicity,mutagenicity, or teratogenicity of this substance. OSHA received a fewcomments on Freon 22, from NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1), the American IndustrialHygiene Assocation, the du Pont Company (Ex. 3-660), and Dr. Grace Ziem(Ex. 46). du Pont and the AIHA stated that OSHA should not adopt limits(short-term, ceiling, or skin notations) for substances for which the ACGIHhas deleted, or is on record as intending to delete, such limits (Exs.8-16, 3-600). Discussions of OSHA's policy on STELs and skin notationsin this rulemaking can be found in Sections VI.C.17 and VI.C.18, respectively.OSHA notes that cardiac sensitization does not occur in animals until levelsreach 25 to 50 times the 1000-TWA limit and, therefore, a STEL that is1.25 times that limit is unwarranted. Dr. Ziem (Ex. 46) reported that Freon22's effects on heart rhythm have been seen at the 300-ppm level. The Agency is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 1000 ppm for chlorodifluoromethane.OSHA concludes that this limit will provide protection against the CNSeffects, asphyxiant effects, and cardiac sensitization effects (which togetherconstitute material health impairments) that could occur as the resultof exposure to Freon 22 at levels above the new PEL. The Agency finds thatthe new limit will substantially reduce these significant risks.<ITAG tagnum="71">o-CHLOROTOLUENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 95-49-8; Chemical Formula: C<T2>7</T2>H<T2>7</T2>Cl</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1090</ITAG>Formerly, OSHA had no limit for o-chlorotoluene. The Agency proposed an8-hour TWA of 50 ppm (consistent with the ACGIH's TLV-TWA) and a 75-ppm,STEL for this substance, a colorless liquid. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1)supported this proposal. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 50-ppm8-hour TWA for o-chlorotoluene. The Agency has decided not to establisha STEL (see Section VI.C.17 for a discussion of OSHA's rationale in regardto STELs for this rulemaking). The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats for o-chlorotoluene is greater than 1600 mg/kg. Whenthe undiluted material was administered orally in doses ranging from 50to 100 mg/kg, the animals experienced weakness and vasodilation at thehigher dose levels, but all survived and were gaining weight two weekslater (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 137). When the undiluted liquid was appliedto the skin of guinea pigs in doses of 1 ml. or 10 ml/kg for 24 hours,moderately severe skin irritation occurred at both dose levels. The guineapigs lost weight over the two-week period following application, indicatingpercutaneous absorption of this substance; however, no dermal LD<T2>50</T2> has been established for o-chlorotoluene. One drop of undilutedmaterial in the eyes of rabbits produced a delayed erythema of the conjunctiva,although this effect cleared after 14 days (Ely 1971, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 137). Rats exposed to an atmosphere of 21 mg/L (or about4000 ppm) for six hours exhibited loss of coordination within 1.5 hours,prostration at 1.75 hours, and tremors at 2 hours. At 14,000 ppm, ratsshowed loss of coordination, vasodilation, labored respiration, narcosis,and eye tearing. Rats exposed at 4000 and 14,000 ppm survived. At 175,000ppm, one of three rats died (Ely 1971, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 137). In another study, mice, rats, and quinea pigs were exposed too-chlorotoluene at a concentration of about 4400 ppm. Mice showed gaspingand convulsions within 30 minutes, and guinea pigs and rats exhibited gasping,hyperpnea, ataxia, and convulsions in 45 minutes. All animals were comatosewithin 60 minutes, and, except for two guinea pigs that continued to surviveat 14 days, all of the animals died (Hazleton Laboratories, Inc. 1966,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3 p. 137). In rabbits, the 24-hour patch test resulted in moderate skin irritation;albino rabbits displayed conjunctival irritation from a single instillationof 0.1 ml of undiluted o-chlorotoluene, but no corneal damage was observedseven days later (Hazleton Laboratories, Inc. 1966, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 137). Data concerning human exposures are lacking; no cases of dermatitis orpoisoning have been reported as a result of occupational exposure. Personalcommunications from several occupational health experts have recommendedlimits for o-chlorotoluene ranging from 25 to 200 ppm TWA (Hopton 1962,Mastromatteo 1971, Elkins 1972, Torkelson 1972, all as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 137). These limits were recommended on the basis of analogy withsimilar compounds, such as the chlorinated benzenes. OSHA received commentson o-chlorotoluene from NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1), the du Pont Company(Ex. 3-660), and the American Industrial Hygiene Association (Ex. 8-16).du Pont and the AIHA stated that OSHA should not adopt limits (short-term,ceiling, or skin notations) for substances for which the ACGIH has droppedor is on record as intending to drop such limits (Exs. 8-16 and 3-660).OSHA agrees with this view in many cases (see Sections VI.C.17 and VI.C.18for discussions of OSHA's policy on STELs and skin notations in this rulemaking).OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 50 ppm for o-chlorotoluene. TheAgency concludes that this limit will protect workers from the significantrisks of eye and skin irritation and systemic poisoning, all material impairmentsof health that may occur following exposure to this substance at levelsabove the new PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">CYCLONITE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 121-82-4; Chemical Formula: C<T2>3</T2>H<T2>6</T2>N<T2>6</T2>O<T2>6</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH has an 8-hour TWA limit of 1.5 mg/m3 for thissubstance. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 1.5-mg/m3 8-hour TWAPEL for cyclonite, with a skin notation; the Agency has decided not toestablish a STEL for this substance (see Section VI.C.17 for a discussionof OSHA's rationale in regard to STELs). Cyclonite exists in the form oforthorhombic crystals. Cyclonite, an explosive and a rat poison, has not been shown in animalstudies to be acutely toxic. In industry, reports of poisonings as a resultof occupational exposures to cyclonite were widespread as late as 1962(Kaplan, Berghout, and Peczenik 1965/Ex. 1-338). Exposure causes centralnervous system effects, including nausea, vomiting, convulsions, and unconsciousness.These clinical signs result from repeated gastrointestinal and respiratoryexposures and from skin absorption (Sunderman et al. 1944, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 162; von Oettingen, Donahue, Yagoda et al. 1949/Ex.1-398). In an epidemiological study, Hathaway and Buck (1977/Ex. 1-418)reported that 8-hour TWA exposures ranging up to 1.57 mg/m3 and averaging0.28 mg/m3 caused no identifiable abnormalities attributable to cycloniteexposure. The American Industrial Hygiene Association (Ex. 8-16) urgedOSHA to drop the STEL for this substance. OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 1.5 mg/m3 TWA and a skin notationfor cyclonite. The Agency concludes that establishing these limits forthis previously unregulated chemical will protect workers from the significantrisk of neuropathic effects, which constitute material health impairmentsthat are associated with inhalation or percutaneous exposure to cyclonite.<ITAG tagnum="71">2,6-Di-tert-BUTYL-p-CRESOL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 128-37-0; Chemical Formula: C<T2>15</T2>H<T2>24</T2>O</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with the selectionof this limit. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 10 mg/m3 for this white crystallinecompound, which is prepared from p-cresol and isobutylene. DBPD is widelyused as a food preservative. DBPD has a low order of toxicity; in extensive animal studies, ingestionhas not been associated with toxic effects (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 227).Deichmann and associates (1955/Ex. 1-505) reported oral LD<T2>50</T2> values of 10.7 g/kg for guinea pigs, 1.7 and 1.97 g/kg formale and female rats, respectively, and ranges of between 0.94 and 2.1g/kg for cats and between 2.1 and 3.2 g/kg for rabbits. One year of dailyoral administration of 0.17 to 0.9 g/kg in dogs produced no effects, nordid a 24-month oral administration of 0.2, 0.5, or 0.8 percent DBPD inrats (Deichmann, Clemmer, Rakoczy, Bianchine et al. 1955/Ex. 1-505). Otherstudies have confirmed these overall results, although some growth ratedecreases and liver weight increases were demonstrated in rats fed 0.01to 0.5 percent DBPD, total daily diet (Brown, Johnson, and O'Halloran 1959/Ex.1-621; Creaven, Davies, and Williams 1966/Ex. 1-547). The estimated human intake of DBPD in the United States does not exceeda few milligrams daily (perhaps no more than 0.2 mg/kg body weight) (Gilbertand Golberg 1965/Ex. 1-902). These authors also observed that the no-effectdietary level for DBPD in rats is 25 mg/kg.

Acute toxicity studies have shown that direct contact mayimpair vision and denature the skin if exposure is repeated. Dietary studiesin rats showed no ill effects after 90 days of feeding at 20 mg/kg/day(Smyth, Carpenter, and Weil 1951/Ex. 1-439). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1)was the only commenter on this substance.

NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) supported theAgency's determination. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 5 mg/m3 for this stable,colorless, odorless, oily liquid with a bitter taste.Diethyl phthalate exposure may cause polyneuritis and disturbance in vestibularfunction. By most routes of administration, this substance has low acutetoxicity in laboratory animals. Oral LD<T2>50</T2> values in the rat range between 9.5 and 31 g/kg (Shibko andBlumenthal 1973/Ex. 1-934); the intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> for the rat is 5.08 ml/kg (Singh, Lawrence, and Autian 1972/Ex.1-436) and, for the mouse, 2.8 g/kg (Calley, Autian, and Guess 1966/Ex.1-890). Chronic feeding studies lasting six or more weeks resulted in no-effectlevels of 2.5 g/kg/day for the rat and 1.25 g/kg/day for the dog, withno specific lesions attributable to diethyl phthalate and no unusual incidenceof tumors (Shibko and Blumenthal 1973/Ex. 1-934).A study of workers exposed to a mixture of diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate,and di-2-ethyl hexyl phthalate vapors in air at concentrations of 8 to53 mg/m3 resulted in findings of no phthalates in the blood (before orafter the exposure) and no peripheral polyneuritis (Raleigh, personal communication,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 200). Fassett (1963a, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 200) reported transient nasal and throat irritation producedby exposure to the heated vapors of diethyl phthalate, but no cumulativeeffects have been noted. A Russian study of workers (employed for between0.5 and 19 years) who were exposed to several phthalate plasticizers (e.g.,butyl phthalate, the higher aryl phthalates, dioctyl phthalate, and benzylbutyl phthalate), as well as the sebacates, adipates, and tri-o-cresylphosphate at concentrations ranging from 1.7 to 66 mg/m3 reported thatthere were complaints of pain, numbness, and spasms in the upper and lowerextremities. These complaints were related to the duration of exposureand usually began after the sixth or seventh year of employment (Milkov,Aldyreva, Popova et al. 1973/Ex. 1-646). These investigators reported polyneuritisin 32 percent of the 47 persons examined for this health effect; of 81persons evaluated for vestibular dysfunction, 78 percent showed depressionof vestibular receptors (Milkov, Aldyreva, Popova et al. 1973/Ex. 1-646).OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 5 mg/m3 for diethyl phthalate.The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workers against the significantrisks of polyneuritis and vestibular dysfunction, which constitute materialhealth impairments that are potentially associated with occupational exposureto this substance at levels above the new PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">DINITOLMIDE (3,5-DINITRO-O-TOLUAMIDE)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 148-01-6; Chemical Formula: C<T2>8</T2>H<T2>7</T2>N<T2>3</T2>O<T2>5</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Diphenylamine exists as monoclinic crystalline leaflets thatdiscolor when exposed to light.Acute oral toxicity data for diphenylamine are limited. A single reportdescribes a study in which a dietary dose of 1500 mg/kg killed 2 of 20rats within 30 days of ingestion (Griswold, Casey, Weisburger et al. 1966/Ex.1-483). This suggests that diphenylamine is significantly less toxic thananiline (Hamblin 1963/Ex. 1-1085). Dietary studies of rats fed 0.025, 0.1,0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 percent diphenylamine for 226 days demonstrated nonmalignantrenal cysts at the three highest doses (Thomas, Cox, and Deeds 1957/Ex.1-873). However, rats given diphenylamine crystals encapsulated in collodiondeveloped bladder papillomas within 125 days (Yoshida, Shimauchi, and Kin1941, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 220). Exposure to diphenylaminedust has been linked to liver, spleen, and kidney changes in experimentalanimals (Robert, DervileandCx.174;1e, and Collet 1937/Ex. 1-928).A report of industrial diphenylamine poisoning in France described bladdersymptoms, tachycardia, hypertension, and eczema (Fairhall 1957g, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 220).OSHA is establishing an 8-hour PEL of 10 mg/m3 TWA for diphenylamine.

NIOSH (Ex. 8-47), Table N1) agrees that this limit is appropriate.The ACGIH has a TLV of 10 mg/m3 TWA for this white crystalline solid. Hodge and Associates (1967/Ex. 1-911; 1968/Ex. 1-912) have reported thatdiuron has a low order of acute and chronic toxicity. For male rats, theoral LD<T2>50</T2> is 3400 mg/kg. In two-year feeding studies of rats and dogs,the no-effect levels were reported to be 250 and 125 ppm, respectively.A concentration of 125 ppm in the diet did not cause reproductive or carcinogeniceffects in a three-generational study of rats (Hodge, Downs, Panner etal. 1967/Ex. 1-911; Hodge, Downs, Smith et al. 1968/Ex. 1-912); 1400 ppmdid not have carcinogenic effects in mice (Innes, Ulland, Valerio et al.1969/Ex. 1-270). Skin irritation and sensitization test findings in guineapigs have been negative (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 228). However, repeateddoses of this pre-emergence herbicide produced anemia in rats and methemoglobinemiaafter hydrolysis to dichloroaniline in the body (<T3>Condensed Technical Information</T3>, du Pont 1961). OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 mg/m3 for diuron. OSHA concludesthat this limit will protect workers from the significant risks potentiallyassociated with workplace exposure to this substance at the levels permittedin the absence of any OSHA PEL. These risks include anemia and methemoglobinemia,both of which constitute material impairments of health. The final rule's10-mg/m3 PEL will substantially reduce these risks. <ITAG tagnum="71">METHYL ACETATE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 79-20-9; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>COOCH<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1249 </ITAG>OSHA's former 8-hour TWA limit for methyl acetate was 200 ppm; the Agencyproposed to retain this limit and to add a STEL of 250 ppm. NIOSH (Ex.8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal. The ACGIH has establishedan 8-hour TWA limit of 200 ppm and a TLV-STEL of 250 ppm. In the finalrule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 200 ppm and a 15-minute STELof 250 ppm. Methyl acetate is a highly volatile, colorless liquid witha pleasant odor. Methyl acetate is mildly narcotic and is a known irritant to the mucousmembranes of the eyes and respiratory passages. Occupational exposure tothis substance by vapor inhalation at unreported levels resulted in inflammationof the eyes, nervous irritation, and a sensation of tightness in the chest(Duquenois and Revel 1934/Ex. 1-779; Fairhall 1957f, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 367). Duquenois and Revel (1934/Ex. 1-779) suggested that,like methyl alcohol, methyl acetate may produce atrophy of the optic nerve.Other researchers have suggested that the methanol formed by hydrolysisin the body may be responsible for the toxicity of methyl acetate and,on this basis, have recommended a limit of 250 ppm in the occupationalsetting (Henderson and Haggard 1943j, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.367). However, Lehmann and Flury (1943d, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 367) have attributed toxic effects (e.g., blood changes, weight loss,lung irritation), as well as some deaths, to chronic exposures to methylacetate at 6600 ppm. The ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 367) reports that ``no cases of irritation orsystemic injury have been reported from industrial exposures to methylacetate below 200 ppm.'' There were no record comments on methyl acetate,except for the concurrence from NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1). OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 200 ppm TWA and a 15-minute STELof 250 ppm for methyl acetate. The STEL is necessary to ensure that exposuresdo not exceed 250 ppm even for a short time because effects have been reported(ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 367) above 250 ppm. The Agency concludes that bothof these limits will protect workers from the significant risk of narcosis,eye and skin irritation, and pulmonary irritation, all of which constitutematerial health impairments. <ITAG tagnum="71">METRIBUZIN </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 21087-64-9; Chemical Formula: C<T2>8</T2>H<T2>14</T2>N<T2>4</T2>OS </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1275 </ITAG>OSHA has not formerly regulated exposure to metribuzin. The proposed PELwas 5 mg/m3. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with the proposal, andthe final rule adopts this limit. The ACGIH has recommended a TLV-TWA of5 mg/m3 for this substance. Metribuzin is a crystalline solid. Metribuzin is a herbicide that has a low order of acute toxicity; singleexposures to high concentrations produce central nervous system depression,and repeated high doses affect the thyroid and liver function (<T3>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</T3> 1981, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 411). The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats has been reported to be 2000 mg/kg; in cats and rabbits,the LD<T2>50</T2> is as high as 500 mg/kg. A four-hour aerosol exposure at concentrationsof between 860 and 892 mg/m3 was tolerated by rats and mice; no skin oreye irritation was observed in rabbits. No sensitizing effects were seenin guinea pigs, and a skin application of the 70-percent wettable powderof 1000 mg/kg per day for three weeks produced no effects in rats (<T3>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</T3> 1981, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 411).Inhalation studies have shown no adverse effects in rats exposed to 31mg/m3 of the aerosol for six hours/day, five days/week during a three-weekperiod (Bayer 1981, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 411). No carcinogeniceffects were observed in rats and mice fed 20. 800, or 3200 ppm for twoyears (Kimmerle 1982a, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 411). A no-effectlevel of 100 ppm was observed in a two-year dietary study of rats and dogs(<T3>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft </T3>1981, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 411); these same investigators observed no teratogenic, embryotoxic,or reproductive effects in rats or rabbits. In Chinese hamsters and mice,no mutagenic activity was observed (Siebert and Lemperle 1974/Ex. 1-689).No human poisonings caused by metribuzin have been reported. In oral long-termstudies, the highest no-observed-effect levels (NOELs) were 2.5 to 5 mg/kgper day (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 411). Single and repeated patch tests inhumans did not cause irritation or sensitization (<T3>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft </T3>1981, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 411). Except for NIOSH's concurrence with this limit (Ex. 8-47,Table N1), no comments were received on metribuzin. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 5 mg/m3 TWAfor metribuzin. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workersagainst the significant risks of metabolic and central nervous system effects,which are material impairments of health that are potentially associatedwith workplace exposure to metribuzin at the levels permitted by the absenceof any OSHA limit. <ITAG tagnum="71">OIL MIST (MINERAL)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 8012-95-1; Chemical formula: None</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1297</ITAG>OHSA formerly had a limit of 5 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA for oil mist. TheAgency proposed to retain mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA PEL and to add 10 mg/m3as a 15-minute STEL; however, the final rule retains the former 8-hourTWA but does not add a STEL. The ACGIH has a 5-mg/m3 TLV-TWA limit anda 10-mg/m3 TLV-STEL for oil mist (mineral), which refers to the airbornemist of petroleum-based cutting oils or of white petroleum oil; the odorof this substance is described as similar to that of burned lubricationoil. Studies in animals have shown that repeated six-hour daily exposures to5 mg/m3 caused no adverse effects (Wagner, Wright, and Stokinger 1964,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 449). At 100 mg/m3, slight changes,including lung effects, were observed in exposed animals (Lushbaugh, Green,and Redemann 1950/Ex. 1-792). It has been suggested that heat-decomposedoil fumes are irritating to the lungs (Wagner, Dobrogorski, and Stokinger1961/Ex. 1-773). OHSA received a number of comments on the proposed STEL for oil mist (Exs.3-829, 3-830, 3-856, 3-1115, 188, and 194; Tr. pp. 7-47 to 7-53). For example,William Fladung, Manager of Environmental Control for the Timken Company,believes that the limits for oil mist presented in the proposed rule arenot justified by the evidence discussed in the preamble to the proposal(Ex. 3-856). According to this commenter, ``the only health effect observedin animals is `lung irritation.' No health effect has been observed inhumans'' (Ex. 3-856). This view was shared by representatives of the independentLubricant Manufacturers Association (Ex. 3-830), the Specialty Steel Industryof the United States (Ex. 3-829), and the Anti-Friction Bearing ManufacturersAssociation (Ex. 3-1115).  In response to these comments, OSHA has reviewed the toxicological evidencefor oil mist. Proctor, Hughes, and Fischman (<T3>Chemical Hazards of the Workplace</T3>, 2nd ed., 1988) report a singlecase of lipoid pneumonitis in a worker repeatedly exposed to high concentrationsof oil mist, and these authors also note that some mineral oils (i.e.,those containing additives and impurities) have been linked to cancersof the skin and scrotum. NIOSH submitted comments to the record notingthat certain types of oils and/or their additives may present a carcinogenichazard (Ex. 150, Comments on Oil Mist.) The United Auto Workers and theAFL-CIO (Tr. pp. 7-47 to 7-53) urged OSHA to adopt a lower PEL on the basisof oil mist's carcinogenic effects. According to the UAW, oil mist ``hasbeen known for many years . . . [to] cause skin cancer, particularly scrotalcancer among exposed workers'' (Tr. p. 7-50). The UAW also believes thatoil mist exposure increases the risk of primary malignancies of the respiratoryand upper digestive systems (Tr. p. 7-50). However, OSHA believes thatthese carcinogenic effects may be attributable to contaminants in the oil,such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and certain additives. OSHA alsonotes that modern refining techniques have generally eliminated these hazardoussubstances from mineral oils. After a review of the record evidence, OSHA fnds that the toxicologicaldata on this substance do not support the addition of a STEL at this time.Accordingly, the final rule retains the 8-hour TWA PEL of 5 mg/m3 but doesnot add a 15-minute STEL of 10 mg/m3 for mineral oil mist. The Agency concludesthat the existing 8-hour TWA limit will protect exposed employees againstthe significant risks of eye and respiratory tract irritation potentiallyassociated with exposures to mineral oil mist. OSHA finds that these eyeand lung effects constitute material impairments of health. <ITAG tagnum="71">PETROLEUM DISTILLATES (NAPHTHA)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 8002-05-9; Chemical Formula: None</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

A study performed by Carpenter, Kinkead, Geary et al. (1975b/Ex. 1-53)exposed rats to between 2800 and 24,200 ppm of naphtha. Motor incoordinationoccurred at 5300 ppm, and convulsions and death occurred in all animalsat 24,200 ppm. Animals exposed to 480 ppm for 63 days showed no signs oftoxicity (Carpenter, Kinkead, Geary et al. 1975b/Ex. 1-53). NIOSH (1977g, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 516) noted that rubbersolvent (naphtha) is composed primarily of C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8 </T2>alkanes and, thus, that the limit of 350 mg/m3 (85 ppm) recommendedfor C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8 </T2>alkanes should apply to naphtha. This recommendation presumesthat all C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8 </T2>alkanes possess equivalent neurotoxicity; however, as discussedabove in Section V (Summary of Commenters' Responses to NPRM Questions),OSHA has concluded that not all of the C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8 </T2>alkanes are neuropathic agents. In establishing the 400-ppm TLV-TWA for petroleum distillates, the ACGIHrelied on observations showing that slight irritation occurs in humansexposed to 430 ppm and that no signs of toxicity occur in animals exposedto 480 ppm. The NIOSH-recommended 85-ppm ceiling limit is based on theassumption that all C<T2>5</T2>-C<T2>8</T2> alkanes possess equivalent neuropathic properties. As discussedabove, OSHA has rejected this hypothesis and is therefore reducing thePEL for petroleum distillates to an 8-hour TWA limit of 400 ppm to protectworkers against the significant risk of irritation, which constitutes amaterial health impairment that is associated with exposure to these substances.OSHA has determined that this limit will substantially reduce this risk.<ITAG tagnum="71">m-PHTHALODINITRILE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 626-17-5; Chemical Formula: C<T2>8</T2>H<T2>4</T2>N<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The doses applied were 0.5, 1.0, and2.0 g/kg; at the two higher dose levels, some changes in organ (unspecified)size, without histopathologic changes, were observed. Female rabbits exposedat the highest dose lost weight (Owen 1972, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 488). A 15-year review of industrial experience revealed no reports of adverseeffects from exposure to m-phthalodinitrile (Zeller, Hofmann, Thiess, andHey 1963, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 488). Williams (1959/Ex. 1-1176)attributes this absence of exposure effects to the fact that the aromaticnitriles, of which m-phthalodinitrile is one, do not liberate cyanide inthe body, as is the case with the aliphatic nitriles. No comments otherthan NIOSH's were received by OSHA on this substance.OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit for m-phthalodinitrile of 5 mg/m\3\.The Agency concludes that this limit will protect exposed workers fromthe significant risk of skin irritation, a material health impairment thatexists at m-phthalodinitrile levels about the new limit.<ITAG tagnum="71">PLATINUM (METAL)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-06-4; Chemical Formula: Pt</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Based on the TLV for platinum soluble salts and the absence of any severehealth effects associated with exposure to the metal dust, the ACGIH recommendeda TLV of 1.0 mg/m\3\ for platinum metal dust. This limit reflects goodindustrial hygiene practice and acknowledges that heavy metal dusts aremore toxic than nuisance dusts (which are controlled to 10 mg/m\3\).

NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) supports the selection of thesePELs. The ACGIH has an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 ppm and a TLV-STEL of 20ppm. Resorcinol occurs in the form of sweet-tasting white crystals thatmay turn pink on exposure to air and light or on contact with iron. Resorcinol has been reported to be less toxic by ingestion or skin penetrationthan either catechol or phenol (von Oettingen 1949 and Koppers Company1974, both as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 511). The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is 301 mg/kg (NIOSH 1977i/Ex. 1-1182). Daily six-hourexposures at 8 ppm for two weeks produced no ill effects in rats, guineapigs, and rabbits. Acute inhalation exposures to a resorcinol-water aerosolat concentrations as high as 7800 mg/m\3\ for one hour and 2800 mg/m\3\for eight hours caused no toxic effects in laboratory animals (KoppersCompany 1974, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 511). In humans, the cutaneous application of solutions or salves containingfrom 3 to 25 percent of this compound may result in local hyperemia, itching,dermatitis, edema, corrosion, and the loss of the superficial layers ofthe skin. If these damages are severe, they may be associated with someor all of the following effects: enlargement of regional lymph glands,restlessness, methemoglobinemia, cyanosis, convulsions, tachycardia, dyspnea,and death (<T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology,</T3> Vol. 2A, p. 2588, Claytonand Clayton, 1981). An epidemiologic study of rubber workers exposed toa hexamethylene-tetramine-resorcinol rubber system revealed no specificsymptoms caused by resorcinol; the concentrations in air were less than0.3 mg/m\3\. In another study, there were no reports of irritation or discomfortby workers when concentrations were 10 ppm or less for periods of at least30 minutes (<T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology,</T3> Vol. 2A, p. 2588, Claytonand Clayton, 1981). Dr. Grace Ziem (Ex. 46) notes that resorcinol exposureis also associated with renal and hepatic effects and with methemoglobinemia.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a PEL of 10 ppm TWA and a STELof 20 ppm for resorcinol. The Agency concludes that this combined limitwill protect workers against the significant risks of irritation, methemoglobinemia,and other adverse effects, all material impairments of health that areassociated with exposure to this substance at levels above the new PELs.<ITAG tagnum="71">TANTALUM (METAL DUST AND OXIDE) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-25-7; Chemical Formulas: (Tantalum metal)TA; (Tantalum oxide)Ta<T2>2</T2>O<T2>5</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1382 </ITAG>OSHA's former PEL for tantalum is 5 mg/m3. The Agency proposed to retainthis limit and to supplement it with a 15-minute STEL of 10 mg/m3, andNIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Tale N1) concurred with this proposal. The final ruleretains an 8-hour TWA for tantalum metal dust and oxide but does not adoptthe proposed STEL for these substances (see Section XI.C.17 for a discussionof OSHA's rationale in regard to STELs). The ACGIH has a 5-mg/m3 TWA buthas recently deleted its former 15-minute STEL of 10 mg/m3. Tantalum dustis a black powder and tantalum oxide is a white, microcrystalline powder.Animal studies by Miller, Davis, Goldman, and Wyatts (1953/Ex. 1-40) havenot implicated tantalum as a cause of pneumoconiosis, although an exposureto 100 mg tantalum oxide produced ``soft white circumscribed pigmenteddust lesions'' in the lungs of these animals (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 554).Additionally, this particular study demonstrated transient bronchitis,interstitial pneumonitis, and hyperemia at the 100-mg exposure level. Tantalumoxide has been used as a dressing for burns (Olsen 1944/Ex. 1-651), andthe use of tantalum gauze in surgical repair produced no long-term adverseeffects (Dales and Kyle 1958/Ex. 1-587). No adverse health effects havebeen associated with industrial exposures to tantalum or its compounds(Cochran, Doull, Mazur, and DuBois 1950/Ex. 1-586). A single oral doseof 6500 mg/kg oxide was virtually nontoxic to rats (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 554). OSHA concludes that the existing 5-mg/m3 TWA for these compounds shouldbe retained to protect workers from the respiratory effects of exposure,which constitute material health impairments. The final rule retains theAgency's former PEL of 5 mg/m3 for tantalum (metal dust and oxide). <ITAG tagnum="71">TRIMETHYL PHOSPHITE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 121-45-9; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>O)<T2>3</T2>P </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1410 </ITAG>OSHA previously had no limit for trimethyl phosphite. The proposed PELwas an 8-hour TWA of 2 ppm and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) supported thisproposal. The final rule establishes this limit. The ACGIH limit for thissubstance is a 2-ppm 8-hour TWA. Trimethyl phosphite is a colorless liquidwith a pungent odor. Trimethyl phosphite's toxic effects include lung, skin, and eye irritation.In a chronic inhalation study of rats, Levin and Gabriel (1973/Ex. 1-746)found that exposure to trimethyl phosphite at concentrations of 500 andplusmin;75 ppm for 7.5 hours daily, five days/week for eight weeks caused an adverseeffect on body weight and, at necropsy, revealed evidence of severe pulmonaryand cutaneous pathology. At exposures of 600 ppm for six hours/day, fivedays/week for four weeks, 70 percent of the rats died, and 10 percent ofthose exposed even at 300 ppm on the same regimen died (Mobil Oil Corporation1979, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 609). Rats exposed at 100 ppm showed signs of eye irritation, and at 300 to 600ppm, mild to severe cataracts developed. At doses of 164 mg/kg, trimethylphosphite caused gross abnormalities in the offspring of treated rats (MobilOil Corporation 1979, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 609). Skin contactwith trimethyl phosphite produced severe skin irritation in rabbits, andinstillation in the eyes of rabbits caused temporary swelling and irritationbut no permanent effects (Fassett 1963c/Ex. 1-1148). In a group of 179 workers exposed to average concentrations of trimethylphosphite of between 0.3 and 4 ppm, no ocular changes were observed (MobilChemical Company 1980, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 609). OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 2 ppm for trimethyl phosphite.The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workers against the significantrisk of eye damage, skin irritation, and upper respiratory tract irritation,all of which constitute material health impairments that are potentiallyassociated with exposures to this substance at levels above the new PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">TRIPHENYL AMINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 603-34-9; Chemical Formula: (C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>)<T2>3</T2>N </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1415 </ITAG>OSHA formerly had no exposure limit for triphenyl amine. The proposed PELwas 5 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA, and the final rule adopts this limit. NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N1) agrees with the selection of this PEL. The ACGIH hasa 5-mg/m3 8-hour TWA limit for this substance. Triphenyl amine takes theform of colorless monoclinic prisms. Animal studies conducted by the Eastman Kodak Company (Roudabush 1973,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 612) showed an oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats of 3200 to 6400 mg/kg and an oral LD<T2>50</T2> in mice of 1600 to 3200 mg/kg. The LD<T2>50</T2> by intraperitoneal administration for both rodent species exceeded6400 mg/kg. Skin and eye sensitivity tests in both rabbits and guinea pigswere essentially negative, except that application of 5 to 20 ml/kg occlusivelyfor four hours produced slight erythema (Roudabush, 1973, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 612). OSHA is establishing a 5-mg/m3 TWA limit for triphenyl amine. The Agencyconcludes that this limit will protect workers against the significantrisk of skin irritation, a material health impairment that is potentiallyassociated with exposure to this substance at levels above the new PEL. <ITAG tagnum="71">URANIUM (INSOLUBLE COMPOUNDS) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-61-1; Chemical Formula: U </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1418 </ITAG>OSHA's former PEL for insoluble uranium compounds is 0.25 mg/m\3\. Theproposed limits were 0.2 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA and 0.6 mg/m\3\ as a15-minute STEL, based on the ACGIH recommendation. These limits are beingestablished in the final rule. Uranium is a silver-white radioactive metal.OSHA's former limit for the insoluble compounds of uranium was based onseveral early studies of uranium's toxic effects in animals; these effectsincluded kidney damage and blood changes (Voegtlin and Hodge 1953, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 617). In the intervening years, a considerablebody of evidence has accumulated based on the actual occupational exposuresof uranium plant workers over periods as long as 25 years. This evidenceshows that, before 1950, workers were often exposed to uranium levels between0.2 and 1.5 mg/m\3\, but that after 1950, only about 6 percent were exposedat 0.05 mg/m\3\ or above; despite these relatively high early exposures,the incidence of all diseases, whether or not linked to radiation exposure,has been no higher than is the case for workers in the general population(ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 617). However, there is also evidence that severalworkers were exposed to brief excursions during which exposure levels reacheda concentration as much as five times the TLV (Wing, Heatherton, and Quigley1963, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 617). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A) indicated that uranium compounds may presenta carcinogenic hazard, but concurred with the proposed limits. OSHA hasreviewed the scientific evidence on insoluble uranium compounds and notesthe results of a five-year inhalation toxicity study of natural uraniumdioxide (UO<T2>2</T2>), which involved monkeys, dogs, and rats (Leach, Hodge, Wilsonet al. 1970, as cited by H.E. Stokinger in <T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology, </T3>3rd rev. ed., Vol.2A, p. 2002, Clayton and Clayton 1981). This study found that the two majorsites of uranium accumulation, the lungs and tracheobronchial lymph nodes,accounted for over 90 percent of the uranium found in the body. Fibroticchanges suggestive of radiation injury were seen occasionally in the tracheobronchiallymph nodes of both dogs and monkeys, as well as in the lungs of monkeysafter exposure periods longer than three years. The lung and lymph nodedata obtained in this study show that the animal body can accumulate sufficienturanium, from prolonged exposures to insoluble uranium dust at 5 mg/m\3\,to create potential radiological hazards. The lung and tracheobronchiallymph node radiation values were high enough, ``in fact, to anticipateradiation hazards in these tissues from exposures at or lower than theoccupational TLV (200 andCx.18;g U/m\3\) recommended by the ACGIH . . .''(<T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology, </T3>3rd rev. ed., Vol.2A, pp. 2002-2003, Clayton and Clayton 1981). Laurence Hecker, representing Abbott Laboratories (Ex. 3-678), commentedthat there was no health basis for the proposed STEL for uranium. OSHAbelieves that the findings from the study discussed above illustrate theimportance of maintaining employee TWA exposures at or below the 0.2-mg/m\3\PEL. Therefore, in accordance with the policy described in Section VI.C.17,OSHA is establishing a STEL for insoluble uranium compounds to ensure thatadequate process control is achieved to maintain exposure at or below theTWA PEL. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.2 mg/m\3\and a STEL of 0.6 mg/m\3\ for the insoluble forms of uranium. The Agencyconcludes that these limits are required to protect workers exposed touranium from the significant risks of kidney or blood disorders and radiologicaldamage potentially associated with both full-shift and excursion exposuresto these compounds. The Agency considers these adverse effects materialimpairments of health. OSHA finds that these limits will substantiallyreduce these risks. Conclusions for This Group of Substances For the group of substances shown in Table C9-1, OSHA concludes that workplaceexposures cause a broad range of adverse health consequences in exposedindividuals; these effects include central nervous system depression, respiratoryirritation, liver and kidney damage, cardiac sensitization, and hepatocellularcancer; OSHA considers all of these effects material impairments of health.For the substances in this group, few comments were received on the newor revised limits being proposed. In addition, NIOSH (Exs. 8-47 and 150)concurred with OSHA's proposed revisions in the great majority of cases.The Agency has determined, based on a thorough review of all of the evidencein the record, that the new or revised limits established in the finalrule are necessary to reduce the significant risk of material health impairmentassociated with workplace exposures to systemic toxins. <ITAG tagnum="81">10. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of PhysicalIrritation and Other Effects </ITAG>Introduction OSHA is establishing or revising the permissible exposure limits for alarge group of substances that cause a variety of irritant and other adverseeffects; in addition, the Agency is retaining its former generic limitof 15 mg/m\3\ total particulate \1\<NOTE/> and its generic limit of 5 mg/m\3\ respirable particulatefor several of the substances in this category. In the final rule, OSHAhas separated this group of physical irritants into two groups, based onthe evidence available on their toxic effects. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Because the term particulate applies to dusts, aerosols,and mists, OSHA uses this term generically in this section to apply toall of these states of matter. For 18 of these substances (one ``Particulates Not Otherwise Regulated''which applies to all particulates not identified in Table Z-1-A), OSHAhas retained the Agency's former 15-mg/m3 generic total particulate limitas an 8-hour TWA. Workers exposed to these 18 substances are subject tothe physical-irritant effects traditionally associated with excessive particulateexposures in the workplace. These effects include eye irritation, interferencewith vision, upper-respiratory-tract irritation, and deposition of particulatein the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. OSHA believes that these effects maycause safety problems among exposed workers, who are more likely than nonexposedworkers to have accidents or safety mishaps because they are distractedand physically irritated by the presence of these substances in the workplace.However, after a thorough analysis of the available literature on these18 substances, OSHA has concluded that retention of the former total-particulatePEL of 15 mg/m3 will provide protection against the exposure effects currentlyknown to be associated with these substances. The 18 substances for whichthe former 15 mg/m3 total particulate limit has been retained are shownin Table C10-1.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 004</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0983-986</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>For the remaining 27 substances in this category, OSHA has reviewed theavailable toxicological literature and has determined that the former generictotal particulate limit is not sufficiently protective. For these substances,the adverse health effects associated with exposure include, in additionto physical irritation, chronic pulmonary disease, cancer, and mutagenic,reproductive, and teratogenic effects. In the past, many of these substanceswere designated as ``nuisance'' dusts or particulates; however, recentdevelopments in toxicology have increasingly shown that exposure to thesesubstances has led to serious health effects. Thus, as applied to thesesubstances, the term nuisance is a misnomer, because the hazards thesesubstances pose in the workplace are real, widespread, and potentiallyserious. NIOSH shares OSHA's concern about this trend in the toxicologyof particulates and has already either designated several of these substances,which were formerly considered ``inert,'' as potential occupational carcinogensor labeled them as causing other target-organ effects. Examples of substancesin this category that the recent toxicological literature has suggestedmay cause more serious effects are: benomyl (reproductive effects); kaolin(pulmonary fibrosis); methoxychlor (cancer); picloram (liver and kidneydamage); synthetic graphite (pneumoconiosis); and titanium dioxide (cancer)(Ex. 8-47).In addition to these diseases, toxicologists have recently expressed concernover the identification of a condition known as pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.This condition, which is apparently caused by the physical effects of particulateexposure, can be fatal if not properly diagnosed, although treatment withlung lavage is effective (NIOSH-ILO 1988). Pulmonary alveolar proteinosishas occurred in workers exposed to several particulates, including theso-called inert dusts. The onset of this condition may occur within monthsafter first exposure to dust.For the 27 physical irritants determined by OSHA to have identified adversehealth effects in the literature, the final rule establishes an 8-hourTWA total particulate limit of 10 mg/m3 and retains the former respirablefraction limit of 5 mg/m3. The 10 mg/m3 limit is consistent with the ACGIH'stotal particulate limit for these substances.OSHA previously had no substance-specific limits for these 44 individualphysical irritants; the Agency's former generic limit for particulateswas 15 mg/m3 as total particulate and 5 mg/m3 as respirable particulate(see Table Z-3 of 29 CFR 1910.1000). OSHA proposed to reduce the limitfor all substances falling within this category and for many specific particulatesto 10 mg/m3, measured as total particulate, to retain the 5-mg/m3 respirableparticulate limit, and to list many of these particulates individuallyon the Z tables. However, in the final rule, OSHA finds it appropriateto retain the former limits of 15-mg/m3 as total particulate and 5-mg/m3as the respirable fraction limits for the 17 substances (and particulatesnot otherwise regulated) in this category for which there is little orno evidence of specific health effects. OSHA is listing these substancesindividually on the Z-1-A table in the final rule. As noted above, theAgency has also determined that worker protection requires that the totalparticulate limits for the remaining 27 substances, which have been shownto cause serious and potentially life-threatening health effects, be setat 10 mg/m3. The 5-mg/m3 respirable particulate limit is retained for allsubstances in the physical-irritant category.There were several general comments on the substances in this category.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) asked for clarification of the fact that OSHA did notmention in the proposal the limits for the respirable fraction of the totalparticulates in this category. NIOSH urged OSHA to include a respirablefraction limit because, ``for substances that typically become airbornein the workplace as respirable particulates, a PEL based on the respirablefraction of the substance would be warranted'' (Ex. 8-47, pp. 9-10). OSHAagrees entirely with NIOSH and wishes to clarify that its former 5-mg/m3limit for respirable particulate is being retained for all of the substancesin this category; the preamble to the proposed rule did not discuss therespirable particulate limit specifically because the Agency did not intendto revise this component of its generic limit for particulates.Several commenters (Exs. 3-661 and 3-726) raised the issue of the interactionbetween the individual listing of particulates in the Z tables and therequirements of OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) (29 CFR 1910.1200).These commenters are concerned that particulates that were formerly considerednonhazardous under the HCS will be considered ``hazardous'' if OSHA liststhese substances separately on the Z tables. On August 8, 1988 (53 <T3>FR</T3> 29822), OSHA published a proposal to modify the HCS. The coverageof nuisance particulates was specifically raised as an issue in that proposal,and the Agency will make a determination regarding that coverage in thefinal HCS rule.Description of the Health EffectsThe adverse exposure effects caused by the 18 substances in this groupfor which the 15-mg/m3 limit is being retained include: interference withvision; deposition of these substances in the eyes, ears, nasal passages,and upper respiratory tract; and skin and corneal irritation. For the groupof 27 substances for which a limit of 10 mg/m3 is being established, theadditional exposure effects include pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, reproductiveeffects, irreversible pulmonary effects, liver and kidney effects, systemicpoisoning, and cancer. As discussed above, these latter effects are increasinglybeing associated with exposure to some of these substances, many of whichwere formerly considered biologically inert.Thus, workers exposed to excessive airborne concentrations of any of thesephysical irritants may have difficulty seeing, may cough uncontrollably,may develop conjunctivitis or dermatitis, or may develop disabling or evenlife-threatening disease. In addition to these primary effects, workersdistracted by physical-irritant effects may be more likely than nonexposedworkers to have accidents and thus to endanger both themselves and others.(These adverse health effects also clearly have substantial productivityimpacts.)Many commenters opposed any reduction in the PELs for these substanceson the grounds that inadequate evidence was provided to support the contentionthat exposure leads to material impairment of health or that a reducedlimit would protect against a significant risk (see, for example, Exs.3-1123, 3-726, 3-755, 3-887, 3-898, 3-939, 3-1012, 3-1016, and 8-22). Typicalof the comments submitted on this subject are those made by the AmericanFeed Industry Association (AFIA):<ITAG tagnum="21">AFIA believes an arbitrary choice by a non-government entity [i.e.,the ACGIH], which is not supported by even a scintilla of scientific evidence,has very limited validity, and should not be used by OSHA as a basis forpromulgating a regulation (Ex. 3-755, p. 19).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Arguing along the same lines, Peter Hernandez of the American Ironand Steel Institute stated that, in his opinion, the effects of exposureto these substances are ``short-term and immaterial'' (Ex. 8-22, pp. 29-30).OSHA is not persuaded by these arguments, for several reasons. First, theACGIH represents the opinion of professional industrial hygienists withexperience and expertise as to what constitutes sound industrial hygieneand public health practice. Second, practical experience has shown thateven the so-called ``inert'' dusts represent a danger to health; the InternationalLabour Organization states:<ITAG tagnum="21">[T]he biological effects of these inert dusts are of a long-term natureand are neither fibrogenic nor carcinogenic, toxic or allergenic. In excessivequantities they will overcharge the protective and scavenging mechanisms,thereby leading to respiratory disease. The extent to which any type ofdust represents a health risk thus depends on exposure, which includesthe nature of the dust, its concentration and the duration of exposure,as well as upon individual factors such as the general constitution andstate of health of the person concerned, including the functional stateof the upper respiratory tract, the lung function and its structure, thegeneral immunological status and specific immunological reactivity, andthe biochemical reactivity. All these factors will play a part in the onsetof disease (ILO 1983, <T3>Encyclopedia of Occupational Health and Safety,</T3> Vol. I, p. 680).</ITAG>In addition, the Agency notes that a particulate standard of 10 mg/m\3\or less (measured as total particulate) is the official standard in a greatmany countries, including Finland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, the UnitedKingdom, Japan, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the Republic of China (Cook1987/Ex. 1-187, pp. 234-241).In addition, as discussed above, OSHA notes with concern the trend in thetoxicology of these substances, which is to find increasingly that substancesformerly believed to be inert are in fact associated with serious and sometimeslife-threatening effects. When exposures to the substances shown in TableC10-1 are kept under good industrial hygiene control in the workplace,OSHA believes that exposures are not likely to result in significant organicdisease or irreversible toxic effects.The following discussions describe the record evidence and OSHA's findingsfor the physical irritants included in this group. In addition, the healtheffects potentially associated with exposures to these substances are reviewed.<ITAG tagnum="71">ALPHA-ALUMINA</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1344-28-1; Chemical Formula: A1<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1014</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no specific limit for alpha-alumina, although OSHA'sgeneral limit of 15 mg/m\3\ total particulate (5 mg/m\3\ for the respirablefraction) applied to this substance. The ACGIH has an 8-hour TWA of 10mg/m\3\, measured as total dust, for alpha-alumina. OSHA proposed an 8-hourTWA of 10 mg/m\3\ for this substance, and this is the limit establishedby the final rule. The 5-mg/m\3\ respirable-fraction limit is retained.Alpha-alumina, also called aluminum oxide, is a white powder that is widelyused as an abrasive grinding material.A study by Miller and Sayers (1941/Ex. 1-595) determined that alumina particleswith diameters of less than 40 microns produced no reaction in laboratoryanimals. The results of a study by Stacy, King, Harrison et al. (1959/Ex.1-761) confirmed the findings of Miller and Sayers; these authors founda-alumina to be nearly inert when injected into the lungs of rats (Stacy,King, Harrison et al. 1959/Ex. 1-761). Inhalation of fine aluminum powdersat unspecified levels did not cause fibrosis in rats, guinea pigs, or hamsters(Gross, Harley, and deTreville 1973/Ex. 1-696).In 1923, shortly after a-alumina replaced sandstone as the industrial abrasiveof choice, Macklin and Middleton (1923, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 21) reported that workers exposed to aluminum oxide dust using the new,synthetic abrasive had much less pulmonary disease than had workers usingsandstone abrasives. Other studies (Sutherland, Meiklejohn, and Price 1937/Ex.1-674; Meiklejohn and Posner 1957/Ex. 1-1060; Meiklejohn and Jones 1948/Ex.1-964) reported that workers exposed to aluminum oxide dust in the chinawareindustry and in aluminum production showed no evidence of pneumoconiosis.However, some early studies (Clark and Simmons 1925/Ex. 1-725; Clark 1929/Ex.1-1048) reported that workers engaged in aluminum oxide production andexposed to dust levels generally between 50 and 100 mppcf showed X-rayevidence of pulmonary fibrosis; these workers are likely also to have beenexposed to silica. Workers exposed during World War II to bauxite fumescontaining both alumina and silica developed pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema;the authors believe that silica fume was involved in the development ofthese diseases (Shaver and Riddell 1947/Ex. 1-666). The ACGIH (1986/Ex.1-3, p. 21) states that alpha-alumina acts as an inert material. However,NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N4) reports that two studies in animals (Stacy,King, Harrison et al. 1959/Ex. 1-761; Stanton, Laynard, Tegeris et al.1981, as cited by NIOSH in Ex. 8-47) have found that exposure to alpha-aluminais associated with the development of respiratory effects. For this reason,NIOSH does not concur with OSHA's limit for this substance, urging insteadthat OSHA establish a lower limit. However, OSHA believes that additionalevidence is needed to support an additional reduction in the PEL for thissubstance. No other comments on alpha-alumina were submitted to the record.OSHA is establishing 8-hour TWA limits of 10 mg/m\3\ total particulateand 5 mg/m\3\ respirable particulate for alpha-alumina, the limits beingestablished for all physical irritants having identified health effects.The Agency concludes that these limits will protect workers from the significantrisk potentially associated with exposures to alpha-aluminum dust in theworkplace. OSHA finds that skin, eye, and upper respiratory irritationand other possible respiratory effects constitute material health impairments.<ITAG tagnum="71">ALUMINUM METAL DUST</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7429-90-5; Chemical Formula: A1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1016</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no specific permissible exposure limit for aluminum metaldust, although the Agency's generic 15 mg/m3 TWA limit for total particulateapplied. The ACGIH has an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 mg/m3 as total dust forthis substance. OSHA proposed a PEL of 10 mg/m3 (total particulate) and5 mg/m3 (respirable fraction) for aluminum metal dust; however, in thefinal rule, OSHA is retaining its former 15-mg/m3 total particulate limitfor this substance. In its elemental form, aluminum is a white, malleable,ductile metal.  Aluminum metal dust has been shown to present a minimal health hazard,according to results from the McIntyre Foundation's 27-year study for aluminumoxide dust (discussed in Stokinger 1981a, in <T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology, </T3>3rd rev. ed., Vol.2A, pp. 1500-1503). No deleterious lung or systemic effects were observedas a result of exposure to aluminum metal dust having a particle size of1.2 um at calculated concentrations equivalent to 2 mg/m3 over an 8-hourworkshift. Even much higher concentrations (not further specified) over10- or 20-minute periods produced no adverse effects (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 22). A comment submitted by the Reynolds Aluminum Company endorses OSHA'sclassification of aluminum metal dust under the general dust and particulateheading (Ex. 3-135). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N4) did not conduct an in-depthreview of the health evidence for this substance.  OSHA has concluded that aluminum metal dusts are appropriately controlledby retaining the Agency's PELs of 15 mg/m3 TWA, as total particulate, and5 mg/m3, as the respirable fraction. OSHA has determined that these limitswill provide protection against the significant risk of physical irritation.<ITAG tagnum="71">AMMONIUM SULFAMATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS 7773-06-0; Chemical Formula: NH<T2>4</T2>SO<T2>3</T2>NH<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1024</ITAG>OSHA formerly regulated ammonium sulfamate under its generic limit of 15mg/m3 as total particulate. The ACGIH has established a limit of 10 mg/m3for this substance as an 8-hour TWA. The final rule establishes a limitof 10 mg/m3 (and 5 mg/m3 for the respirable fraction) for ammonium sulfamate,which is the limit the Agency proposed. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N4) concurswith this limit. Ammonium sulfamate is a noncombustible, white, crystallinesubstance.  Lehman (1951/Ex. 1-790) found oral LD<T2>50</T2>s of 3900, 5700, and 3000 mg/kg in rats, mice, and quail, respectively.He also reported that no effects were noted in rats administered 10,000ppm ammonium sulfamate in the diet for 105 days. The hazards associatedwith exposure to ammonium sulfamate include eye and nose irritation, interferencewith vision, and the danger of accidents caused by the distraction andavoidance reactions typical of workers overexposed to dusts in the workplace.Only NIOSH commented on ammonium sulfamate.  OSHA is establishing a PEL of 10 mg/m3 TWA, total particulate, and retainingthe 5-mg/m3 TWA PEL for respirable particulate for ammonium sulfamate.The Agency concludes that these limits will protect workers against thesignificant risk of material health impairment in the form of physicaland other irritation that is associated with exposure to this substance.<ITAG tagnum="71">BARIUM SULFATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7727-43-7; Chemical Formula: BaSO<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposalincluded a 10-mg/m3 TWA PEL for barium sulfate (total particulate), andthe final rule establishes this limit and additionally retains the 5-mg/m3PEL for the respirable fraction. Barium sulfate is a white or yellowish,odorless, tasteless powder.  Einbrodt, Wobker, and Klippel (1972/Ex. 1-1020) exposed rats to a concentrationof 40 mg/m3 for two months and concluded that barium sulfate is not toxic.As an inert dust of the noncollagenous type, however, barium sulfate hasthe potential to cause pneumoconiosis through tissue reactions to accumulateddust in the lung (Anonymous, <T3>British Medical Journal </T3>1972, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 48). Barium sulfate has not been known to cause adverse effects in industrialworkers exposed over periods of several years. (Doig 1976/Ex. 1-551). NIOSHdid not conduct an in-depth review of the health evidence for barium sulfate(Ex. 8-47, Table N4); no other comments on this substance were submittedto the record.  In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 8-hour TWA PEL for barium sulfateof 10 mg/m3 (total particulate) and retaining the 5-mg/m3 8-hour TWA (respirableparticulate). The Agency concludes that these limits will protect workersagainst the significant risks of material health impairment in the formof eye, nose, and upper-respiratory-tract irritation and, perhaps, of pneumoconiosisthat are associated with exposure to barium sulfate.<ITAG tagnum="71">BENOMYL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 17804-35-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>14</T2>H<T2>18</T2>N<T2>4</T2>O<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

OSHA proposed a PEL of 10 mg/m3 as total particulatefor benomyl, and the final rule establishes this limit and retains theAgency's existing 5-mg/m3 respirable fraction limit. Benomyl is a whitecrystalline solid; exposures to this substance occur in its particulateform.Studies of rats and rabbits indicate that the oral and skin absorptionLD<T2>50</T2>s are greater than 10,000 mg/kg, and studies of guinea pigsshow a very low risk of skin irritation. Application to the shaved intactskin of ten male guinea pigs (as aqueous suspensions containing 5, 12.5,and 25 percent benomyl) resulted in slight irritation; one of ten guineapigs had mild erythema two days after application of the high concentration(E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Inc. 1974, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 49). In another study, instillation of 10 mg of dry 50-percentpowder or of 0.1 ml of 10-percent suspension in mineral oil caused onlytemporary mild conjunctival irritation (E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co.,Inc., unpublished data, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 49). NIOSH notesthat benomyl exposure may cause adverse reproductive effects (Ex. 8-47,p. 12); no other comments on this substance were submitted.In the final rule OSHA is establishing 10 mg/m3, total particulate, and5 mg/m3, respirable particulate, for this substance as 8-hour TWA limits.The Agency concludes that these limits will protect workers from the significantrisks of benomyl's effects, which include irritation and erythema, andthe possibility that exposure to benomyl may cause reproductive effects.OSHA finds that these health effects constitute material impairments ofhealth. OSHA will also continue in the future to monitor the scientificevidence on the health effects associated with exposure to benomyl to determinewhether a further reduction in the PEL is warranted.<ITAG tagnum="71">BISMUTH TELLURIDE (UNDOPED)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1304-82-1; Chemical Formula: Bi<T2>2</T2>Te<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Bismuthtelluride appears as gray, hexagonal platelets; it is also available asingots or single crystals.An eleven-month inhalation study of dogs, rabbits, and rats exposed topure undoped bismuth telluride dust at 15 mg/m3 showed the pulmonary responsestypical of exposures to inert dusts (Wagner, Madden, Zimber, and Stokinger1974, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 59). NIOSH has not evaluated theevidence for undoped bismuth telluride in depth (Ex. 8-47, Table N4). Noother comments on this substance were submitted.OSHA is retaining its permissible exposure limits of 15 mg/m3 TWA, as totalparticulate, and 5 mg/m3, as the respirable fraction, for pure undopedbismuth telluride. The Agency concludes that these limits protect workersfrom the significant risks associated with workplace exposures to bismuthtelluride.<ITAG tagnum="71">BORON OXIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1303-86-2; Chemical Formula: B<T2>2</T2>O<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed total particulatePEL was 10 mg/m3, and this limit is established in the final rule; the5-mg/m3 PEL for the respirable fraction is retained. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN4) concurs with these limits. Boron oxide occurs as either a white powderor a granular solid, and it has a bitter taste.Animal studies indicate that eye and skin irritation were caused by theocular instillation and the topical application, respectively, of boronoxide to the skin and eyes of rabbits. Aerosol administration at variousexposure levels for varying time periods caused mild irritation and anincrease in urine acidity and creatinine coefficient in dogs and rats (Wilding,Smith, Yevich, et al. 1959/Ex. 1-599). Young rats that were force-fed a10-percent slurry to boron oxide in water for three weeks showed no growthretardation or other effects (Wilding, Smith, Yevich et at. 1959/Ex. 1-599).Garabrant and co-workers (1984/Ex. 1-555) determined the prevalence ofeye and respiratory irritation among boron oxide-exposed workers; thoseexposed to boron oxide concentrations ranging from 1.2 to 8.5 mg/m3 werethen compared with controls. Workers exposed at an average concentrationof 4.1 mg/m3 reported significant increases in productive cough; eye, nose,and throat irritation; dryness of the mouth; and sore throats (Garabrant,Bernstein, Peters, and Smith 1984/Ex. 1-555).The ACGIH believes that a total dust TLV-TWA of 10 mg/m3 will provide protectionagainst boron oxide's irritant effects ( ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3). However,OSHA specifically noted in the preamble to the proposed rule that irritationof the upper respiratory tract and eyes occurs among occupationally exposedworkers at levels below 10 mg/m3, and the Agency solicited additional informationon the boron oxide exposure levels associated with adverse health effectsin workers.U.S. Borax (Exs. 3-744, and 8-49; Tr. pp. 9-11 to 9-120) submitted commentsto the record on the health effects of exposure to the borates and boronoxide. John C. Middleton, Manager of Product Safety for U.S. Borax ResearchCorporation, opposed the reduction in the PEL for boron oxide from 15 mg/m3to 10 mg/m3 on the grounds that such a reduction was not ``supportable''(Tr. p. 9-112). Mr. Middleton urged OSHA to ``delay action'' on boron oxideuntil a large epidemiological study being sponsored by U.S. Borax is completed;the American Mining Congress (Ex. 3-876) supported U.S. Borax's requestfor a delay.In response to these commenters, OSHA notes that boron oxide dust is notan inert substance; it causes eye and upper respiratory tract irritationas well as skin irritation. Although OSHA will follow the progress of theU.S. Borax study with great interest, the Agency does not find it appropriateto delay further in reducing the PEL for boron oxide.Accordingly, the final rule establishes permissible exposure limits of10 mg/m3 TWA, as total particulate, and 5 mg/m3 TWA, as the respirablefraction, for boron oxide. The Agency concludes that these limits willprotect workers against the significant risk of upper-respiratory-tractand eye irritation associated with exposure to this substance.

The Agency's former 5-mg/m3 PELfor the respirable fraction is also being retained.

Glycerin is an oily, hygroscopic liquid with a warm, sweet taste.Glycerin was long considered to be nontoxic; however, there are indicationsthat the mist may be injurious to the kidneys at very high exposure levels(Campanacci 1965/Ex. 1-1047). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) states that, at high concentrations,exposure may cause hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, and renal failure. Ackermann,BaandCx.174;4ssler, and Wagner (1975, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.286) have reported that glycerin mist is easily metabolized and excreted.In the adult human of average weight, 2 grams of glycerol can be metabolizedand excreted in an 8-hour workday. At this metabolic and elimination rate,the ACGIH believes that no ill effects are likely to occur as a resultof exposure at or below 10 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 286).NIOSH, the only commenter on this substance, does not agree that the finalrule's limit of 10 mg/m\3\ is appropriate for glycerin mist because a recentstudy by Wiebe and Barr (1984, as cited in Ex. 8-47) found reproductiveeffects in rats injected intratesticularly with glycerin mist (Ex. 8-47).OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 mg/m\3\ (total particulate)and retaining the 5-mg/m\3\ (respirable particulate) limit for glycerinmist. The Agency concludes that these limits will provide protection againstthe significant risks of glycerin exposure, which include kidney damageand, perhaps, testicular effects. OSHA finds that these health effectsconstitute material health impairments, and the Agency intends to monitorthe literature on glycerin in the future.<ITAG tagnum="71">GRAPHITE, SYNTHETIC</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: None; Chemical Formula: None</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1191A</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no specific limit for synthetic graphite, although itwas covered under the Agency's generic total particulate limit. OSHA'sproposed 8-hour TWA PEL for synthetic graphite was 10 mg/m\3\ (total particulate),and this limit is established by the final rule; the 5-mg/m\3\ limit forthe respirable fraction is retained. The ACGIH also has a TLV-TWA limitof 10 mg/m\3\ for graphite as total dust. Synthetic graphite is a crystallineform of carbon made from the high-temperature treatment of coal or petroleumproducts; it has the same properties as natural graphite.Meiklejohn reported in 1958 that synthetic graphite injected intraperitoneallyin mice produced effects characteristic of those of the inert dusts (Meiklejohn1958, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 291).In humans, exposure to natural graphite has long been associated with thedevelopment of pneumoconiosis (Koopman 1924/Ex. 1-131; Ruttner, Bovet,and Aufdermauer 1952/Ex. 1-661; Pendergrass, Vorwald, Mishkin et al. 1967/Ex.1-77). Lister (1961/Ex. 1-422) and Lister and Wimborne (1972/Ex. 1-423)reported fibrotic changes in the lungs of a worker who had been engagedfor 17 years in the production and milling of synthetic graphite. Otherreports of lung injury caused by exposure to graphite have not distinguishedbetween the form of the graphite (i.e., natural or synthetic) causing theinjury; in addition, exposures to impurities, such as quartz silica, wereinvolved in many of the reported cases (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 291). NIOSH(Ex. 8-47) does not believe that it is appropriate to distinguish betweenthe natural and synthetic forms of graphite and notes that the Lister andWimborne (1972/Ex. 1-423) study described above suggests that syntheticgraphite dust exposure ``is capable of producing pneumoconiosis.'' NIOSHbelieves that a 2-mg/m\3\ 8-hour TWA PEL is appropriate for synetheticgraphite because this is the limit set for coal dust (respirable) to protectagainst pneumoconiosis (Ex. 8-47). OSHA received no responses other thanNIOSH's to a question raised in the proposal about synthetic graphite-relatedoccupational disease. OSHA intends to continue to evaluate any new evidenceon synthetic graphite exposures, such as the study on carbon/graphite fiberssubmitted by NIOSH (Zumwalde and Harmison 1980, as cited in Ex. 8-47),to determine whether further action to reduce the PEL is warranted in thefuture.At present, however, OSHA is reducing the 8-hour TWA total particulatelimit for synthetic graphite from 15 mg/m\3\ to 10 mg/m\3\ and retainingthe 5-mg/m\3\ limit for the respirable fraction to protect against thesignificant health risks associated with graphite exposure in the workplace.OSHA concludes that these limits will substantially reduce the risks ofgranite-induced respiratory disease, which constitutes a material impairmentof health.<ITAG tagnum="71">GYPSUM</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7778-18-9; Chemical Formula: CaSO<T2>4</T2>H<T2>2</T2>O</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

However, in the finalrule, OSHA is retaining both the 8-hour TWA PEL of 15 mg/m\3\ (total particulate)and the 5-mg/m\3\ respirable particulate limit for gypsum. Gypsum is foundeither as colorless or white crystals.The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) states that gypsum does not ``produce significantorganic disease or toxic effect when exposures are kept under reasonablecontrol.'' Exposures in excess of the recommended limit may result in reducedvisibility, deposits of gypsum dust in the eyes, ears, and nasal passages,and skin irritation. NIOSH, the only commenter on this substance, has notthoroughly reviewed the effects of gypsum exposure (Ex. 8-47, Table N4).In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the Agency's limit for gypsum (totalparticulate) of 15 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA and the 5-mg/m\3\ limit forthe respirable fraction of this substance.

Kaolin may be a white powder, or a white or yellow-white,earthy mass.  Exposure to excess amounts of kaolin dust may cause injury to the skinor mucous membranes (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3). Although NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN4) has not conducted an in-depth review of kaolin dust exposure, it notesthat exposure to kaolin dust has been associated with respiratory effects(Lapenas and Gale 1983, as cited in Ex. 8-47). OSHA intends to monitorthe developing toxicological literature on kaolin in the future. No othercomments on this substance were received.  At this time, however, OSHA is establishing PELs of 10 mg/m3 (total particulate)and 5 mg/m3 (respirable particulate) as 8-hour TWA limits for kaolin.

Limestone is rock formed by the accumulationof organic remains that consist of calcium carbonate and, less often, magnesiumcarbonate.  Direct contact with limestone dust at unspecified levels has been associatedwith the development of severe eye irritation and moderate skin irritation(<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials,</T3> 7th ed., p. 677,Sax and Lewis 1989). The application of 500 mg limestone to the skin ofrabbits for 24 hours produced moderate irritation, and 750 mg instilledinto the eyes of rabbits caused severe irritation. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is 6450 mg/kg (Sax and Lewis 1989, p. 677). The AmericanIron and Steel Institute (Exs. 3-1123 and 8-22) argued that limestone dustproduces effects that are ``short-term and immaterial'' (Ex. 8-22, pp.29-30); however, OSHA does not agree that the physical irritant effectscaused by exposure to dusts and particulates are not material impairments;such irritation involves the skin, eyes, nose, upper respiratory tractand mucous membranes.  In the final rule, OSHA is retaining 8-hour TWA limits of 15 mg/m3 (totalparticulate) and 5 mg/m3 (respirable particulate) for limestone.

In the final rule, however, OSHA isretaining its former total particulate limit of 15 mg/m3 for magnesite.Magnesite occurs as a white powder.  Magnesite is considered by both OSHA and the ACGIH to be one of the duststhat ``do not produce significant organic disease or toxic effect whenexposures are kept under reasonable control'' (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3). Exposureto excess levels of magnesite in the workplace causes skin or mucous membraneirritation resulting either from contact with the magnesite itself or fromthe rigorous cleansing procedures necessary for removing the dust. NIOSH,the only commenter on this substance, has not substantively reviewed theeffects of exposure to magnesite (Ex. 8-47, Table N4).  OSHA is retaining its 8-hour TWA PEL of 15 mg/m3 TWA for magnesite, measuredas total particulate; the 5-mg/m3 TWA limit for the respirable fractionis also being retained.

Slight reactions (not further specified) have been reported in human subjectsafter exposures of less than 10 minutes to freshly generated MgO fume atconcentrations of from 400 to 600 mg/m3 (Drinker, Thomson, and Finn 1927/Ex.1-356). Animal and human studies of magnesium oxide fume exposure haveshown toxicities less marked than but similar to those attributable tozinc oxide fume (Drinker and Drinker 1928/Ex. 1-314). The symptoms of exposureinclude those of metal fume fever (fever, chills, muscular pain, nausea,and vomiting) and leukocytosis, symptoms analogous to those caused by exposureto zinc oxide fume. NIOSH does not concur with the final rule's limit forthis fume. NIOSH notes that exposure to magnesium oxide may also causechronic respiratory disease (Ex. 8-47, p. 12); no other comments on thissubstance were received.  In the final rule, OSHA is setting a PEL of 10 mg/m3 TWA (total particulate)and retaining the 5-mg/m3 TWA limit for the repirable fraction of magnesiumoxide fume.

The proposedPEL was 10 mg/m3 (total particulate), with a skin notation. The final ruleestablishes a 10-mg/m3 TWA limit for total malathion particulate and includesa skin notation; the 5-mg/m3 TWA limit for the respirable fraction is retained.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N4) concurs with the selection of these limits.Malathion is a noncombustible, yellow to deep brown liquid with a skunk-likeodor.Malathion is a widely used organophosphorus insecticide having relativelylow level of toxicity; some authors have determined that malathion is approximately1/100th as toxic as parathion (Johnson, Fletcher, Nolan, and Cassaday 1952/Ex.1-149). Rats fed malathion at a concentration of 100 ppm for two yearsexhibited no toxic effects (Hazleton and Holland 1953/Ex. 1-126). Severaloccupational and research exposures involving scientists or human volunteersproduced no changes in blood cholinesterase or other effects (Rider, Mueller,Swader et al. 1969/Ex. 1-189; Hayes, Mattson, Short, and Witter 1960/Ex.1-90; Culver, Caplan, and Batchelor 1956/Ex. 1-177). Fatalities have beenreported in the Japanese and Indian literature, but these deaths have alwaysinvolved extremely high doses of malathion (Chabra 1970/Ex. 1-151; Horiguchi1973/Ex. 1-221). The symptoms of malathion overexposure include headache,lacrimation, vomiting, tremors, and convulsions. The Agency received, in addition to NIOSH's comment, two record commentson malathion. ConAgra, Inc. (Ex. 3-635) questioned the classification ofthis substance as a nuisance dust ``since most malathion-containing pesticidesare liquids and are available over the counter for public use in retailstores'' (Ex. 3-635, p. 2). OSHA points out that this health effects categoryincludes all particulates (i.e., can include aerosols and mists generatedby the handling of liquid materials). Another commenter, Lawrence H. Hecker, Director of Corporate IndustrialHygiene and Toxicology for Abbott Laboratories, questioned the need fora skin notation for a substance with a dermal LD<T2>50</T2> of 200-mg/kg or less in animal tests when there was no evidenceof systemic effects in humans as a result of skin contact (Ex. 3-678, p.3). Dr. Hecker stated that this 200-mg/kg cutoff would be consistent withOSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). OSHA agrees withDr. Hecker that a consistent policy in regard to skin notations is appropriatebut does not agree that the 200-mg/kg level is an appropriate cutoff point.The Agency finds that a dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits of 1000 mg/kg is a better indicator of dermal toxicity;this is the Hazard Communication Standard's upper cutoff for a toxic, ratherthan highly toxic, substance administered by the dermal route (see SectionVI.C.18 of this preamble for a discussion of OSHA's reasoning on this issue).In addition, OSHA believes that evidence that a substance has caused systemictoxicity in humans exposed via the dermal route sufficient reason to retaina skin notation; in the case of malathion, OSHA has received reports ofexposed workers whose blood cholinesterase levels were reduced after dermalexposure to this substance. OSHA is therefore retaining the skin notationfor malathion in the final rule. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing PELs of 10 mg/m3 TWA (total particulate)and 5 mg/m3 TWA (respirable particulate) for malathion, with a skin notation.The Agency finds that exposure to malathion poses a significant risk ofmaterial health impairment in the form of cholinesterase inhibition. <ITAG tagnum="71">MARBLE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1317-65-3; Chemical Formula: None </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

This is the limit that was proposed for the total particulateof methoxychlor, and the final rule establishes this limit; the 5-mg/m3limit for the respirable particulate is retained. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN4) concurs with the selection of these limits. The reported oral LD<T2>50</T2> for methoxychlor in rats is 6000 mg/kg (Lehman 1954, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 364). Lehman also determined that 100 ppm fortwo years is the lowest dietary level producing no effect in rats; thiscorresponds to a level of 350 mg/man/day (Lehman 1954, as cited in ACGIH,1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 364). Results of another dietary study indicated thatrats fed 200 ppm methoxychlor for two years were not affected in termsof growth or survival (Hodge, Maynard, and Blanchet 1952/Ex. 1-488). Tegerisand co-workers (1966/Ex. 1-389) reported that dogs fed 1 g/kg daily forsix months showed weight loss; most animals died within nine weeks whenthe dietary level was increased to 2 g/kg daily (Tegeris, Earl, Smalley,and Curtis 1966/Ex. 1-389). Morgan and Hickenbottom (1978/Ex. 1-351) reportedthat male Holtzman rats fed 10, 40, 160, or 640 mg/kg for 24 hours showedno liver abnormalities. Extrapolating from animal data, Lehman (1954) estimatedthe dose levels that would produce toxic effects in humans as follows:the fatal oral dose would be 450 grams; adverse health effects would occurat 6430 mg/kg orally; and 2414 mg/kg is the level at which dermal effectswould be predicted to occur (Lehman 1954, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 364). NIOSH concurs with these limits (Ex. 8-47, Table N4) but recommends thatmethoxychlor also be designated as a potential occupational carcinogen.However, OSHA notes that both IARC and NCI find the evidence for the carginogenicityof methoxychlor in animals to be inadqequate (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>7th ed., p. 1326,Sax and Lewis 1989). The Agency will continue to monitor the scientificevidence for this substance in the future. No other comments on methoxychlorwere received by OSHA., In the final rule, OSHA is reducing the existing 15-mg/m3 8-hour TWA limitfor methoxychlor to 10 mg/m3 (total particulates) and retaining the 5-mg/m3TWA limit for the respirable fraction to reduce the significant healthrisks of systemic toxicity, which constitutes a material impairment ofhealth.

Molybdenum is a silver-white metal or adark gray or black powder.Mogilvskaya (1950, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 415) reported thatthe dust of molybdenum metal and molybdenum dioxide caused irritation ofmucosal surfaces in white mice after an intensive dusting for one hour;in a similar 30-day exposure, the metal and the dioxide proved minimallypoisonous.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N4) notes that reviews of molybdenum's toxicityhave been published by Browning (1961b), Friberg and Lener (1986), andStokinger (1981d). NIOSH states that, although these reviewers generallyagree that the insoluble compounds of molybdenum have a low order of toxicity,there is some evidence that respiratory effects have been caused by exposureto these compounds. NIOSH recommends that the toxicological literatureon molybdenum be evaluated on a continuing basis. No other comments onthis substance were received by OSHA.OSHA is establishing PELs for the insoluble compounds of molybdenum of10 mg/m\3\ TWA (total particulate) and 5 mg/m\3\ TWA (respirable particulate),measured as molybdenum.

No. 1294</ITAG>OSHA formerly covered all otherwise unregulated particulates under a single8-hour TWA PEL of 15 mg/m\3\ (measured as total particulate) and 5 mg/m\3\(measured as the respirable fraction). The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 10 mg/m\3\(as total dust) for particulates having a quartz content of less than 1percent. OSHA's proposed total particulate PEL for these physical irritantswas 10 mg/m\3\; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N4) concurred with the proposedlimit. In the final rule, OSHA is retaining its 15-mg/m\3\ total particulatePEL for particulates that are not specifically identified in the Z tables;OSHA is also retaining its 5-mg/m\3\ respirable particulate limit for thesesubstances. The Agency has decided to retain its existing limits for particulatesthat are not specifically identified in the Z tables because this groupof physical irritants consists of substances, both inorganic and organic,for which substance-specific toxicologic data are not available. For thosephysical irritants for which specific toxicologic data are available, OSHAhas separately identified the substance in Table Z-1-A and has promulgateda 10-mg/m\3\ 8-hour TWA (measured as total particulate) and a 5-mg/m\3\8-hour TWA PEL (measured as the respirable fraction) in the final rule.The 8-hour TWA limits of 15 mg/m\3\ (total particulate) and 5 mg/m\3\ (respirablefraction) apply to all not-otherwise-regulated particulates (i.e., to thoseirritants that are not specifically identified in the Z tables). For example,OSHA's limits for corn dust, a particulate not identified in the Z tablesor otherwise regulated, are 15 mg/m\3\ (total dust) and 5 mg/m\3\ (respirabledust). The Agency believes that other particulates that present physicalirritant hazards in the workplace should also be regulated under the finalrule's generic total particulate limit of 15 mg/m\3\.OSHA believes that good industrial hygiene practice requires that exposuresto these particulates be controlled in the workplace to or below the 15-mg/m\3\level as an 8-hour TWA to protect workers from the broad range of adverseeffects associated with exposure to these substances. In the past, theseparticulates were often called ``nuisance'' or ``inert'' substances. Theseterms are misleading, however, because exposures to these substances inthe workplace may cause serious and sometimes disabling effects. Further,good industrial hygiene and public health practice require that workplaceexposure to particulates be maintained below the level associated withphysical irritation, accidents, and respiratory effects.Several commenters (see, for example, Exs. 3-661, 3-755, 3-1012, 3-1112,and 8-22) submitted comments on OSHA's proposed generic total particulatelimit. Most of these participants argued that the proposed reduction inthe 8-hour TWA PEL from 15 mg/m\3\ to 10 mg/m\3\ was unwarranted becausethere was, in the opinion of these commenters, no evidence of adverse healtheffects associated with exposure to these particulates (Exs. 3-755, 3-1012,3-1112, and 8-22). According to Peter Hernandez of the American Iron andSteel Institute (Ex. 8-22), the effects of such exposures are ``short-termand immaterial.''OSHA has responded to these commenters in the final rule by establishinga lower 8-hour TWA total-dust limit of 10 mg/m\3\ for all particulateshaving identified health effects in the toxicological literature, and retainingthe former 15-mg/m\3\ total particulate limit for those particulates notspecifically linked to health effects other than physical irritation. OSHAfinds that good industrial hygiene practice demands, and prudent publichealth policy supports, effective workplace control over exposure to allparticulates. The effects associated with overexposure to particulatesin the workplace constitute material impairments of health and functionalcapacity and include upper respiratory tract irritation, skin injury, eyeirritation, and other forms of physical irritation.The 15-mg/m\3\ 8-hour TWA total particulate PEL applies to all particulatesnot otherwise regulated, not just to inorganic dusts. The OSHA Review Commissioninterpreted the Agency's former generic dust standard as applying onlyto mineral dusts, primarily because this limit was entered on the Z tablesunder the heading of ``mineral dust.'' The ACGIH and OSHA both had intendedthis limit to apply to all particulates, organic and inorganic. Exposureto organic particulates at high levels also causes material health impairment,such as throat, skin, and eye irritation, upper-respiratory-tract problems,and the safety hazards caused by distraction in the workplace.In the final rule, OSHA establishes an 8-hour TWA limit of 15 mg/m3, measuredas total particulate, and retains the 5-mg/m3 limit for respirable particulatesfor all particulates not otherwise regulated. The Agency concludes thatthese limits will protect workers against the significant safety and healthrisks associated with exposure to excessive concentrations of these substances,which include reduced visibility, deposits in the eyes, ears, and nasalpassages, throat and eye irritation, upper-respiratory-tract problems,skin injury, and other forms of physical irritation. The change in terminologyfrom nuisance dusts to particulates not otherwise regulated clarifies OSHA'sintent and also more accurately reflects the fact that exposure to allparticulates at levels higher than those being established in this finalrule causes material impairment of health and functional capacity in workersexperiencing these exposures.<ITAG tagnum="71">PENTAERYTHRITOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 115-77-5; Chemical Formula; C(Ch<T2>2</T2>OH)<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PEL was 10 mg/m3 TWA (total particulate),and this is the limit established in the final rule; the Agency's 5-mg/m3respirable particulate TWA limit is being retained. Pentaerythritol isan odorless, white crystalline solid.Rats exposed to pentaerythritol at 11,000 mg/m3 for six hours were reportedto show no ill effects from a single exposure, and rats, dogs, and guineapigs exposed six hours daily for 90 days also showed no effects (Keplingerand Kay 1964/Ex. 1-743). The oral LD<T2>50</T2>s in guinea pigs and mice were 11.3 and 22.5 g/kg, respectively;rats survived oral doses as high as 16 g/kg. At higher doses, animals displayeddiarrhea, tremors, ataxia, and loss of righting reflex (Keplinger and Kay1964/Ex. 1-743). Daily applications of a saturated aqueous solution oftechnical pentaerythritol to rabbit skin produced no significant irritation;a single application of 10 g/kg aqueous paste on intact or abraded rabbitskin produced no evidence of percutaneous absorption (Keplinger and Kay1964/Ex. 1-743; Hercules, Inc., as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 462).Instillation of a 50-percent aqueous suspension into the conjunctival sacof rabbits' eyes resulted in slight transient irritation (Hercules, Inc.,as cited in ACGIH 1968/Ex. 1-3, p. 462).Human volunteers are reported to have eliminated 85 percent of dietarypentaerythritol unchanged in the urine within 30 hours. A slight and transientincrease in apparent blood sugar that was proportional to the ingesteddose appeared in these subjects soon after administration (Berlow, Barth,and Snow 1958, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 462). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47,Table N4) has not conducted an extensive review of this substance. No othercomments were submitted to the record.The final rule promulgates an 8-hour PEL of 10 mg/m3 TWA (total particulate)for pentaerythritol, and the 5-mg/m3 respirable fraction PEL is retained.The Agency concludes that these limits will protect employees from thesignificant risks of physical irritation potentially associated with exposureto pentaerythritol at higher levels. OSHA finds that physical irritationconstitutes a material impairment of health within the meaning of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="71">PERLITE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: None; Chemical Formula: None</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1310</ITAG>OSHA formerly regulated perlite under its generic total particulate limitof 15 mg/m3. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 10 mg/m3 for perlite as total dustcontaining less than 1 percent quartz. The proposed PELs were 10   mg/m3(total particulate) and 5 mg/m3 TWA (respirable particulate): however,the final rule retains the 15-mg/m3 TWA PEL for perlite as total particulatecontaining less than 1 percent quartz. The respirable fraction limit of5 mg/m3 is also retained. Perlite is a natural volcanic glass; it is essentiallyan amorphous mineral consisting of fused sodium-potassium-aluminum silicate.Perlite is reported to have a free-silica content varying from zero to3 percent (Anderson, Selvig, Baur et al. 1956 and the Perlite Institute,both as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 467). In its processed crude andexpanded forms, perlite is reported to have a measurable quartz contentof 0.4 percent quartz and 0.2 percent cristobalite (Sheckler 1977, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 467). There are no published reports of adversephysiologic effects from exposure to perlite dust. NIOSH, the only commenteron perlite, has not reviewed the evidence for this substance in depth (Ex.8-47, Table N4).OSHA finds that perlite is nontoxic when airborne total particulate concentrationsare maintained at levels of 15 mg/m3 or below and when its quartz contentis limited to a level below 1 percent crystalline silica. For these reasons,the final rule establishes an 8-hour PEL of 15 mg/m3 TWA for total perlitedust containing less than 1 percent quartz and retains the 5-mg/m3 TWAPEL for the respirable fraction of perlite dust. OSHA concludes that theselimits protect workers from the significant risk of eye, skin, and otherforms of physical irritation.<ITAG tagnum="71">PICLORAM</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1918-02-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>3</T2>Cl<T2>3</T2>N<T2>2</T2>O<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1328</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no limit for picloram, but regulated it at the generictotal particulate limit of 15 mg/m\3\ for all particulates. The ACGIH hasa TLV-TWA of 10 mg/m\3\ and a TLV-STEL of 20 mg/m\3\ (both as total dust)for this white powder, which has an odor like that of chlorine; these werethe limits proposed for picloram. The final rule promulgates the 10-mg/m\3\TWA limit for total particulate but does not include a STEL.Picloram has low acute oral toxicity, with LD<T2>50</T2> values of 3.75 g/kg for rats, 1.5 g/kg for mice, and 2.0 g/kgfor rabbits (NIOSH 1979b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 489). Two-yearfeeding studies showed no ill effects in albino rats and beagle dogs fromingestion of does up to and including 150 mg/kg/day (McCollister and Leng1969, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 489). At 225 mg/kg/day, rats displayedmoderate liver and kidney changes and, in females, slight body weight lossafter 90 days. These authors (McCollister and Leng 1969, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 489) also reported no fertility, reproduction, or lactationeffects in albino rats fed at levels of up to 3000 ppm (0.3 percent) ina three-generational study. Although maternal toxicity in rats was reportedat dietary levels of 750 and 1000 mg/kg administered during days 6 through15 of gestation, neither teratogenic nor neonatal effects were observedwhen subtoxic or maternally toxic doses of picloram were administered duringorganogenesis (Thomson et al. 1972, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.489). The National Cancer Institute (NCI) (1977d, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 489) found a dose-related increase in benign liver tumors in femalerats only and concluded that ``under the conditions of the bioassay, thefindings are suggestive of the ability of the compound to induce benigntumors in the livers of female Osborne-Mendel rats.'' Based on these results,NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N4) concludes that ``picloram is not a nuisanceparticulate and is not without toxic effects.'' OSHA notes that piclorammust therefore be added to the list of substances formerly believed tobe inert but subsequently shown to be toxic. No other comments on picloramwere submitted to the rulemaking record.At the present time, however, OSHA is establishing 8-hour TWA limits of10 mg/m\3\ (total particulate) and 5 mg/m\3\ (respirable fraction) forpicloram. The final rule does not include a short-term limit; in accordancewith the policy described in Section VI.C.17 for short-term limits, OSHAhas reviewed the evidence and has concluded that there is no basis forestablishing a STEL for picloram, as proposed. The Agency concludes thatthese total and respirable particulate limits will minimize the significantrisk of material health impairment in the form of systemic effects, suchas liver and kidney damage, that are potentially associated with exposureto this substance at higher levels. OSHA intends to monitor the healtheffects literature on picloram in the future.<ITAG tagnum="71">PLASTER OF PARIS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7778-18-9; Chemical Formula: CaSO<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1331</ITAG>OSHA's former Z-3 table listed an 8-hour TWA exposure limit of 15 mg/m\3\(total particulate) for Plaster of Paris. The ACGIH has a 10-mg/m\3\ TWAfor Plaster of Paris, measured as total dust, and this is the limit thatwas proposed. The final rule retains 15 mg/m\3\ as the 8-hour TWA PEL forthe total particulate of Plaster of Paris; the 5-mg/m\3\ limit for therespirable fraction is also retained. Plaster of Paris is a fine, whitepowder.Where occupational exposures to Plaster of Paris have been limited, notoxic effects or organic diseases of the lungs have occurred. Exposureto excessive levels of dust in the workplace may result in reduced visibilityor injury to the skin or mucous membranes from the dust itself, or in damageto the skin from the rigorous skin-cleansing procedures required to removethe dust (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3). Only NIOSH commented on this substance;NIOSH stated that it had not substantively reviewed the effects of Plasterof Paris exposure (Ex. 8-47, Table N4).OSHA is retaining both the 8-hour TWA of 15 mg/m\3\ (total particulate)and the 8-hour TWA PEL of 5 mg/m\3\ (respirable particulate) for Plasterof Paris. The Agency concludes that these limits will protect against thesignificant risks of skin, eye, and other forms of physical irritation.<ITAG tagnum="71">PORTLAND CEMENT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 65997-15-1; Chemical Formula: None</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1333</ITAG>OSHA formerly had a limit of 50 mppcf (approximately 15 mg/m\3\) for Portlandcement containing less than 1 percent crystalline silica. The ACGIH hasa TLV/TWA of 10 mg/m\3\ for Portland cement as total dust containing lessthan 1 percent quartz. The proposed PEL was 10 mg/m\3\, measured as totalparticulate, and this is the limit established in the final rule; the 5-mg/m\3\respirable fraction limit is retained. Portland cement refers to a classof hydraulic cements that are odorless gray powders containing less than1 percent crystalline silica. Portland cement is insoluble in water andcontains tri- and dicalcium silicate, in addition to varying amounts ofalumina, tricalcium aluminate, and iron oxide.Intraperitoneal injection of Portland cement in guinea pigs produced anabsorptive reaction, which is an effect typical of inert particulates.Portland cement is eventually eliminated from the tissue and is generallynot considered harmful when ingested (Miller and Sayers 1941/Ex. 1-595).In a study of industrial exposures, Gardner and associates (1939/Ex. 1-589)found no evidence of Portland-cement-related pneumoconiosis in 2,278 workerswho had been heavily exposed to this substance for prolonged periods oftime (Gardner, Durkan, Brumfiel, and Sampson 1939/Ex. 1-589). Conflictingreports of pneumoconiosis (Parmeggiani 1951, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 494; Prosperi and Barsi 1957/Ex. 1-1093) are attributed to thepresence of silica in the inhaled dust rather than to exposure to Portlandcement itself (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 494). Cement dermatitis does occuramong exposed workers, however, as a consequence of the alkaline, abrasive,and hygroscopic properties of the wet cement, which cause irritation ofthe skin (Schwartz, Tulipan, and Birmingham 1957a/Ex. 1-1168). NIOSH, theonly commenter on this substance, reported that it has not thoroughly reviewedthe health effects for Portland cement (Ex. 8-47, Table N4).OSHA is establishing 8-hour TWA PELs of 10 mg/m\3\ (total particulate)and 5 mg/m\3\ (respirable fraction) for Portland cement containing lessthan 1 percent quartz. The Agency concludes that these limits will protectworkers against the significant risks associated with on-the-job exposuresto Portland cement dust. These risks include eye, skin, and mucous membraneirritation, and may include more severe respiratory effects, all of whichconstitute material health impairments. In addition, revising the totalparticulate limit to 10 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA will simplify employeeexposure monitoring for Portland cement, since gravimetric rather thanimpinger methods can then be used.<ITAG tagnum="71">ROUGE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: None; Chemical Formula: None</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1351</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no specific limit for rouge but regulated this substanceunder the Agency's generic total particulate standard of 15 mg/m\3\ asan 8-hour TWA. The ACGIH has an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 mg/m\3\ for rougeas total dust containing less than 1 percent quartz, and this is the limitthat was proposed. The final rule establishes 10 mg/m\3\ as the 8-hourTWA PEL for the total particulate of rouge and retains the 5-mg/m\3\ 8-hourTWA for the respirable fraction of rouge dust. Rouge is a high-grade redpigment, composed mainly of ferric oxide, that is used as a polishing agentfor glass, jewelry, etc.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N4) believes that exposure to rouge should be reducedto levels below 10 mg/m\3\ on the basis of evidence showing that exposureto hematite dust (ferric oxide) increased the risk of lung cancer in hematiteminers. According to NIOSH, this human evidence is consistent with theresults of two recent animal studies: Warshawsky, Bingham, and Niemeier(1984 as cited in Ex. 8-47), which showed that intratracheal administrationsof ferric oxide and exposure to benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) ``enhances the metabolicactivation of BaP''; and Niemeier, Mulligan, and Rowland (1986, as citedin Ex. 8-47), who found that ferric oxide has co-carcinogenic potential.OSHA shares NIOSH's concern about rouge's carcinogenicity and intends tomonitor toxicological developments closely in the future to determine whetherfurther reduction in the PEL is warranted. No other comments on rouge werereceived.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 10 mg/m\3\ forthe total particulate of rouge and is retaining 5 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hourTWA for the respirable fraction. OSHA concludes that these limits willprotect workers from the significant health risks associated with workplaceexposure to higher levels of rouge. These effects include eye, nose, andupper respiratory irritation and, perhaps, other more serious chronic diseases,all of which constitute material health impairments within the meaningof the Act.<ITAG tagnum="71">SILICON</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-21-3; Chemical Formula: Si</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposedtotal particulate PEL for silicon was 10 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA, andthis limit is established in the final rule; the 5-mg/m\3\ respirable fractionlimit is retained. Silicon is a black to gray, lustrous, needle-like crystalthat is used in the manufacture of semiconductors.The evidence of silicon's toxicity in animals is conflicting. An earlystudy by McCord, Fredrick, and Stolz (1937/Ex. 1-640) reported no responsein guinea pigs and rats injected intraperitoneally with silicon. A morerecent study (Schepers 1971/Ex. 1-570) demonstrated pulmonary lesions inrabbits administered an intratracheal dose of 25 mg silicon dust. NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N4) has not throughly reviewed the health effects evidencefor silicon, and no other comments on silicon were submitted to the record.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 mg/m\3\(total particulate) for silicon and retaining the 5-mg/m\3\ (respirablefraction) limit. The Agency concludes that these limits will reduce thesignificant health risks potentially associated with exposure to this substanceat higher levels. These risks include eye, skin, mucous membrane and otherforms of physical irritation and may include chronic respiratory effects.OSHA finds that these effects constitute material health impairments.<ITAG tagnum="71">SILICON CARBIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 409-21-2; Chemical Formula: SiC</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed total particulate PEL for silicon carbide was10 mg/m\3\, and the final rule promulgates this limit and retains the 5-mg/m\3\respirable fraction limit for silicon carbide, which is a green to blue-blackirridescent crystal.An animal study (Gardner 1923/Ex. 1-737 showed that, although exposureto silicon carbide alone produced no fibrosis of the lungs, exposure ofguinea pigs infected with tuberculosis to silicon carbide (six hours/day,five days/week for one year) aggravated pulmonary tuberculosis to the extentthat extensive fibrosis occurred. Guinea pigs exposed to silicon carbidedust and infected with the tubercle bacteria developed tuberculopneumoconioticlesions (Gross, Westrick, and McNerney 1959/Ex. 1-697). Miller and Sayers(1941/Ex. 1-595) observed that silicon carbide dust administered by intraperitonealinjection to guinea pigs produced no reaction.Bruusgaard (1949/Ex. 1-1143) found that X-rays of 10 out of 32 workersexposed to average levels of 34 mppcf of silicon carbide for 15 years ormore demonstrated pulmonary changes; these 10 workers were also tuberculin-positive.Miller, Davis, Goldman, and Wyatts (1953/Ex. 1-40) described three casesof pulmonary reactions and hyperglobinemia in tungsten carbide industryworkers; these authors concluded that exposure to silicon carbide was nota hazard unless the exposed workers already had pulmonary tuberculosis.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N4) has not reviewed the health effects literaturefor silicon carbide in depth. No other comments on this substance weresubmitted.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 10-mg/m\3\ TWA total particulatelimit for silicon carbide and retaining the 5-mg/m\3\ TWA respirable fractionlimit.

The proposed total particulate PEL was 10 mg/m\3\;however, in the final rule, OSHA is retaining a total particulate limitof 15 mg/m\3\ for starch. Starch is a white, odorless powder. Exposure to high concentrations of starch dust may result in impaired vision,or may cause injury to the mucous membranes or skin.

Temephos was formerly regulatedunder OSHA's generic particulate limit of 15 mg/m\3\. The ACGIH limit is10 mg/m\3\ (total dust) as an 8-hour TWA. The proposed PEL was 10 mg/m\3\(total particulate), and this is the limit promulgated in the final rule;the 5-mg/m\3\ limit for the respirable fraction of temephos dust is retained.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N4) concurs with the selection of these PELs. Temephosmay be a white crystalline solid or a viscous brown liquid. In rats and mice, temephos has an acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> of 400 mg/kg or greater. Various animal species tolerated dosesof 10 mg/kg without clinical effect and 1 mg/kg without effect on cholinesteraseactivity (Gaines, Kimbrough, and Laws 1967/Ex. 1-553). Laws, Morales, Hayes,and Joseph (1967/Ex. 1-562) revealed that human volunteers consuming oraldoses or temephos at levels of either 256 mg/man/day for five days or 64mg/man/day for four weeks evidenced no detectable effects on erythrocyteor plasma cholinesterase levels. Murphy and Cheever (1972/Ex. 1-567) reportedthat 1 mg of temephos per liter of drinking water produces no effect. Theseauthors found that rat liver carboxylesterases were at least 30 times moresensitive to inhibition from temephos than were rat cholinesterases. Assumingthat human liver carboxylesterases are proportionately more sensitive thancholinesterases, it is estimated that significant inhibition of these carboxylesterasescould occur as a result of consuming 2 liters of drinking water containing1 mg/L of temephos. Although nonspecific liver carboxylesterase is notcritical for normal physiologic function, adverse effects on this enzymecould increase the susceptibility of exposed individuals to chemicals anddrugs that contain carboxylesterase linkages (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 557).The ACGIH derived its limit of 10 mg/m\3\ TWA for temephos from studiesof malathion, which has an acute LD<T2>50</T2> of 2100 mg/kg in rats, or roughly one-half that of temephos.Because humans tolerate 16 mg/day oral doses of malathion without effectson blood cholinesterase levels, the ACGIH believes the 10-mg/m\3\ limitis appropriate for temephos (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 557).OSHA agrees with the ACGIH's reasoning in this matter and is establishinglimits in the final rule of 10 mg/m\3\ (total particulate) and 5 mg/m\3\(respirable fraction) for temephos. The Agency concludes that these limitswill protect workers from the significant risk of cholinesterase inhibitionand reduction in carboxylesterase activity, which together constitute materialhealth impairments within the meaning of the Act and are potentially associatedwith exposure to this substance. <ITAG tagnum="71">4,4'-THIOBIS (6-TERT-BUTLY-n-CRESOL)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 96-69-5; Chemical Formula: C<T2>22</T2>H<T2>30</T2>O<T2>2</T2>S</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

OSHA proposeda 10-mg/m3 total particulate TWA limit and a 5-mg/m3 respirable fractionPEL for 4,4'-thiobis, and these limits are established in the final rule.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N4) concurs with the selection of these limits.4,4'-Thiobis is a light gray to tan powder with a slightly aromatic odor.In a 30-day study, rats fed diets of 500 ppm 4,4'-thiobis exhibited normalweight gain; those rats fed five times this amount exhibited enlarged liversand a reduced rate of weight gain (Lefaux 1968/Ex. 1-814). In a 90-daystudy reported by the same author, rats fed 50 ppm showed no toxic effects,but male rats fed 500 ppm ate and grew at a slightly lower rate. No pathologicchanges were observed in the 500-ppm-dosed rates. A dose of 5 g/kg of 4,4'-thiobisproved lethal to rats, with the predominant symptom being gastroenteritis.NIOSH was the only commenter on this substance.

The Agencyproposed PELs of 10 mg/m3 (total particulate) and 5 mg/m3 (respirable particulate)for titanium dioxide, and these limits are established in the final rule.Titanium dioxide is a white crystalline solid. Miller and Sayers (1941/Ex. 1-595) reported that intraperitoneal injectionsof titanium dioxide in guinea pigs showed a tendency to remain in the injectedtissues but not to produce a proliferative response. A study by Grandjean,Turrian, and Nicod (1956/Ex. 1-638), in which rats were administered 50mg of titanium dioxide intratracheally, showed pigmented dust depositsin the lungs. In addition, evidence of infection appeared in the alveoliof one rat and diffuse fibrosis was found in the lungs of a separate testanimal. No nodule formation was observed (Grandjean, Turrian, and Nicod1956/Ex. 1-638). Another study by Dale (1973/Ex. 1-624) revealed thickeningof the walls of the alveoli in the lungs of rabbits injected with titaniumdioxide dust; however, lungs had returned to normal by three months post-treatment.Feeding studies of rats and mice at doses of 2.5 percent or 5 percent titaniumdioxide for 103 weeks revealed no signs of carcinogenicity in either species(National Cancer Institute (NCI) 1979d/Ex. 1-947). At the rulemaking hearing, NIOSH (Tr. p. 3-95) testified that exposureto this substance is associated with ``a risk of cancer . . . . The incidenceof tumors in animals exposed to titanium dioxide (Lee, Trochimowicz, andReinhardt 1985) meets the . . . criteria for . . . [a] potential occupationalcarcinogen.'' Accordingly, NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N4) recommends a full6(b) rulemaking for this substance. In response to NIOSH, OSHA notes thatthe Agency intends to monitor the developing literature on titanium dioxideto determine whether an additional reduction in the PEL is warranted. NIOSHwas the only commenter on titanium dioxide. OSHA is establishing 8-hour TWAs of 10 mg/m3 (total particulate) and 5mg/m3 (respirable particulate) for titanium dioxide in the final rule.OSHA concludes that the final rule's limits will protect workers from thesignificant health risks associated with exposure to titanium dioxide athigher levels.

The proposed PEL was 10 mg/m3 (total particulate) as an 8-hourTWA and 5 mg/m3 (respirable fraction) as an 8-hour TWA. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47,Table N4) concurs with the proposed limits. In the final rule, OSHA isestablishing a 15-mg/m3 total particulate limit for vegetable oil, whichis a pale yellow, oily liquid.One commenter (Ex. 3-1080) stated that OSHA had not, in the proposal, demonstratedthat vegetable oil mist presents a health and safety hazard. OSHA findsthat oil mist presents the same safety and health hazards as do all ofthe physical irritants. Occupational exposure to vegetable oil mist isassociated with a variety of health and safety hazards, including interferencewith vision; eye tearing, and skin and other forms of physical irritation.OSHA is establishing 8-hour TWA limits of 15 mg/m3 (total particulate)and 5 mg/m3 (respirable particulate) for vegetable oil mist (except castoroil, cashew nut, or similar irritant oils).

The proposed PEL was 10 mg/m3 (total particulate),and the final rule promulgates this limit. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N4) agreesthat this PEL is appropriate. The ACGIH has established an 8-hour TWA of10 mg/m3 for zinc stearate, measured as total dust. Zinc stearate is awhite hydrophobic powder.A report in <T3>Folia Medica </T3>(Volita and Noro 1957, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 646) documented the case of a worker exposed to zinc stearate dustfor 30 years who died from extensive fibrosis of the lungs. More recentstudies have revealed incidences of pulmonary fibrosis associated withencephalopathy that stemmed directly from exposure to aluminum dust, whichis frequently coated with stearic acid (<T3>British Journal of Industrial Medicine </T3>1962, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 646); the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 646) is uncertain ofthe relevance of this report to zinc stearate exposures.Observations of long-term worker exposures to this dust in the rubber industryrevealed no adverse effects of exposure (B.F. Goodrich Rubber Company,private communication, as cited in the ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 646). NIOSHwas the only commenter on zinc stearate.OSHA is establishing a 10-mg/m3 TWA limit for this particulate (measuredas total particulate) and is retaining the 5-mg/m3 TWA limit for the respirablefraction. The Agency concludes that these limits will prevent the significanthealth risks associated with workplace exposures to zinc stearate dustat higher levels. OSHA finds that the pulmonary effects potentially associatedwith exposure to zinc stearate constitute material impairments of healthwithin the meaning of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="71">ZINC OXIDE DUST</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1314-13-2; Chemical Formula: ZnO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1438</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no exposure limit specifically for zinc oxide dust. TheACGIH has a limit of 10 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA for zinc oxide, measuredas total dust. The proposed PEL was 10 mg/m3, and this limit, measuredas total particulate, is established by the final rule. Zinc oxide dustis a white or pale yellow powder.According to Turner and Thompson (1926/Ex. 1-1124), exposure to finelydivided zinc oxide dust can produce symptoms similar to those for metalfume fever. Beeckmans and Brown (1963/Ex. 1-775) reported that catalyticallyactive zinc oxide dust is more toxic when treated with ultraviolet light.Aside from these considerations, the ACGIH considers zinc oxide dust tobe a nuisance dust.Two comments on zinc oxide were submitted to the rulemaking record (Exs.3-673 and 3-675), but neither of these comments addressed the health effectsassociated with zinc oxide exposure. NIOSH does not concur with these limits;the NIOSH RELs for zinc oxide dust are 5 mg/m3 TWA (respirable fraction)and 15 mg/m3 (total dust) as 15-minute ceilings (Ex. 8-47, Table N4). NIOSHbelieves that exposure to zinc oxide dust causes respiratory effects andcites Gupta, Pandey, Misra, and Viswanathan (1986); Lam, Conner, Rogerset al. (1985); and NIOSH (1975d) in support of this view. OSHA will monitordevelopments on the toxicology of zinc oxide in the future to ensure thatthe PELs for this substance are protective.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing limits of 10 mg/m3 TWA (total particulate)and 5 mg/m3 TWA (respirable particulate) for zinc oxide. The Agency concludesthat these limits will protect workers from the significant risk of materialhealth impairment in the form of physical irritation and, perhaps, of respiratoryeffects.ConclusionsOSHA's generic 8-hour TWA particulate standard (29 CFR 1910.1000, TableZ-3) was adopted from the 1968 ACGIH TLV-TWA of 15 mg/m3 for total dustand 5 mg/m3 for respirable dust. At the time, the ACGIH considered the15-mg/m3 value to be ``an acceptable limit of good hygienic practice,''based on the then-prevailing ``lack of knowledge'' of any adverse exposure-relatedeffects at levels below this value (<T3>Documentation of the Threshold Limit Values and Biological ExposureIndices, </T3>ACGIH 1966/Ex. 1-13). Shortly after OSHA adopted the ACGIH's1968 limit, the ACGIH revised its limit downward to 10 mg/m3 for totaldust and 5 mg/m3 for respirable dust. In justifying this reduction, theACGIH noted that the lower levels would ``result in appreciable improvementof working conditions in plants where the old limit of 15 mg/m3 formerlyprevailed'' (<T3>Documentation of the Threshold Limit Values for Substances in WorkroomAir, </T3>3rd ed., p. 190, ACGIH 1971).In the final rule, OSHA has determined that it is appropriate to set a10-mg/m3 total particulate limit for those particulates demonstrated tohave, in addition to physical-irritant properties, specific adverse healtheffects. These substances are also being identified separately in TableZ-1-A. For the 18 substances in this section that are physical irritantsbut for which other health effects have not specifically been identified,OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA total particulate limit of 15 mg/m3. Thesesubstances are also separately identified in Table Z-1-A. For the groupof Particulates not otherwise regulated (which includes all workplace particulates,both organic and inorganic) that is not separately identified in TableZ-1-A, OSHA is establishing a generic total particulate limit of 15 mg/m3.For all of the particulates in this section, the agency's former 5-mg/m3TWA limit for the respirable fraction is being retained.<ITAG tagnum="81">11. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Odor Effects</ITAG>IntroductionThis category includes three substances that have a variety of toxic effects,including intolerable odors; they are grouped together in this sectionbecause their permissible exposure limits were set at levels that wouldprevent intolerable concentrations of these odors in the workplace. OSHAis retaining its existing 8-hour TWA limits for the three substances inthis category; the Agency believes that the PELs for these substances provideadequate prevention against these odorant effects. At levels above thoseestablished by these PELs, workers are distracted from the task at hand,may be more prone to accidents, and are likely to experience considerablediscomfort. OSHA is retaining its existing limits for these odorants basedon the data described below, which provide information on the levels atwhich intolerable odor effects occur. Table C11-1 shows the substancesincluded in this group and their former, proposed, and final rule limits,as well as their CAS and HS numbers. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 1067 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>Description of the Health Effects The chemicals in this category have obnoxious odors and cannot willinglybe tolerated by most workers for any period of time. Because odor detectionoccurs at very low concentrations for many of these chemicals, OSHA's existingpermissible exposure limits were set at levels below the concentrationat which the odor would become intolerable to employees. The preamble to the proposed rule (53 <T3>FR</T3> 20961) asked commenters for information on the extent to whichexposure to these odorant chemicals causes material impairment of health.Several commenters addressed this question (see discussion of this issuein Section V of this preamble). For example, William Prokop of the NationalRenderer's Association (Ex. 3-11) is of the opinion that the variabilityin odor threshold and response among individuals makes ``the selectionof a suitable limit based on odor objectionability . . . quite arbitrary.''This commenter reports that ``there can be a hundredfold difference inolfactory sensitivity'' even within a group consisting only of 10 people(Ex. 3-11, p. 2). Because of such inter-individual variability, Mr. Prokopbelieves that the exposure limits should not be set on the basis of intolerableodor (Ex. 3-11). OSHA notes that it is a longstanding practice in industrialhygiene to prevent the hazards associated with obnoxious workplace odors;both the ACGIH and OSHA have had such limits for more than 20 years. Inaddition, the levels selected for these substances take the variabilitydescribed by Mr. Prokop into account, because they are set at the levelfound to be unobjectionable by most exposed individuals. According to NIOSH (Ex. 8-47): <ITAG tagnum="21">[T]he odors emitted by industrial chemicals often play an importantrole in occupational safety and health. . . . These odors may cause unduehealth concerns among exposed workers or may create safety hazards by distractingworkers from their tasks. Strong odors in the workplace may also mask thepresence of other, more toxic substances. . . . Olfactory fatigue oftenoccurs and should be considered a functional impairment that can resultin increased worker exposure . . . (Ex. 8-47, p. 41). </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">OSHA does not agree with NIOSH that these chemicals constitute materialhealth impairments in situations where odor is the only adverse effectat the level of concern. OSHA's reasoning on this issue is discussed furtherin Section V of the preamble. The following sections describe the record evidence on each of these chemicalsand their adverse health effects in animals and humans. These effects,which range from nausea to narcosis, generally occur at levels higher thanthe limits for these substances; that is, the limits for these substanceswere set to prevent these more serious effects as well as objectionableodor effects. Because odor effects range in severity from distracting tointolerable, these limits have been set below the concentration at whichthe odor becomes objectionable enough to create a significant safety risk.<ITAG tagnum="71">ISOPROPYL ETHER </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-20-3; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2>CHOCH(CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1226 </ITAG>OSHA's former limit of 500 ppm (8-hour TWA) is being retained for isopropylether, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs that this limit is appropriate.The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 250 ppm and a TLV-STEL of 310 ppm forthis liquid, which has a sharp, sickly sweet odor similar to that of ether.Animal studies have shown that exposures to high concentrations of isopropylether cause narcosis and death (Machle, Scott, and Treon 1939/Ex. 1-348).Twenty exposures at a 1-percent vapor concentration produced intoxicationand depression but no significant blood or organ weight changes. In rabbits,the minimum lethal dose has been reported to be 5 to 6.5 g/kg. The liquidis an irritant to the skin and mucous membranes and causes dermatitis onrepeated exposure (Machle, Scott, and Treon 1939/Ex. 1-348). Humans exposed for 15 minutes to isopropyl ether concentrations of 300ppm experienced no overt irritation but complained about the objectionableodor of isopropyl ether; however, eye and nose irritation did occur asa result of five-minute exposures to 800 ppm. A 15-minute exposure to 500ppm was not reported by volunteers to be irritating (Silverman, Schulte,and First 1946/Ex. 1-142). NIOSH was the only commenter to the record onthis substance. The final rule retains OSHA's former limit for isopropyl ether of 500 ppmas an 8-hour TWA. OSHA is retaining its former limit because the evidencesuggests that, although some volunteers complained of the odor at 300 ppm,the concentration reached 800 ppm before volunteers experienced objectionableeffects. <ITAG tagnum="71">PHENYL ETHER </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 101-84-8; Chemical Formula: (C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>)<T2>2</T2>O </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1314 </ITAG>OSHA is retaining its former 8-hour TWA limit of 1 ppm for phenylether,and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) supports this decision. The ACGIH recommendsa TWA-TLV of 1 ppm and a 2-ppm 15-minute STEL for phenyl ether. Phenylether is a colorless liquid or solid with a low volatility; its vapor hasa disagreeable odor. The acute oral lethal dose is approximately 4 g/kg for rats and guineapigs, and single doses of between 1 and 2 g/kg administered to variousspecies have shown no liver, spleen, kidney, thyroidal, or gastrointestinaltoxicities in surviving animals (Vogel, Snyder, and Schulman 1964/Ex. 1-681).Repeated inhalation studies in rats, rabbits, and dogs have shown that20 exposures to 4.9 ppm for five days per week, seven hours per day producedno adverse effects. Eye and nasal irritation were observed in rats andrabbits exposed at 10 ppm (Hefner, Leong, Kociba, and Gehring 1975/Ex.1-329). Skin and eye irritation have been reported only as a result ofprolonged undiluted exposures. There is no evidence that skin absorptionpresents a health hazard (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 475). The primary complaintsassociated with human exposures to phenyl ether vapor are of disagreeableodor and occasional nausea (Hake and Rowe 1963b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 475). NIOSH was the only commenter on this substance. OSHA is retaining its former TWA limit of 1 ppm for phenyl ether; the Agencyfinds insufficient evidence to support the adoption of a STEL to complementthe TWA. <ITAG tagnum="71">VINYL TOLUENE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 25013-15-4; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>CH=CH<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1427 </ITAG>OSHA is retaining its limit of 100 ppm (8-hour TWA) for vinyl toluene.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs with the retention of this limit. TheACGIH recommends a TWA of 50 ppm with a 100-ppm short-term exposure limit.Vinyl toluene is a colorless liquid with a strong, disagreeable odor. Wolf, Rowe, McCollister et al. (1956/Ex. 1-404) noted fatty degenerationof the liver and an increase in kidney and liver weights in rats, guineapigs, rabbits, and monkeys subjected to approximately 100 seven- to eight-hourexposures to vinyl toluene at 1250 ppm. Some deaths occurred among therats in this group. Animals exposed to vinyl toluene at 600 ppm appearednormal and showed no blood or urine abnormalities, no gross or microscopictissue changes, and no changes in growth rate or organ weight (Wolf, Rowe,McCollister et al. 1956/Ex. 1-404).Human volunteers reported eye and nose irritation at 400 ppm and objectionableodor at 300 ppm. At 50 ppm, the odor of vinyl toluene was detectable, butno irritation was experienced and the odor was not intolerable (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 630). NIOSH was the only commenter on this substance.OSHA is retaining its 8-hour TWA limit of 100 ppm for vinyl toluene: theAgency finds that this level protects workers against the significant riskof intolerable odor and irritation caused by vinyl toluene exposures inthe workplace. The Agency has found no health evidence to suggest thata short-term limit is necessary, and the final rule accordingly does notcontain a STEL for vinyl toluene.<ITAG tagnum="81">12. Substances for Which Limits are Based on Analogy to Related Substances</ITAG>IntroductionOSHA is establishing limits for 73 substances on the basis of their toxicologicand structural similarities to other chemical substances that create significantrisks of systemic toxicity, ocular effects, kidney or liver damage, andother similarly adverse health effects. For 46 of these substances, OSHAhas not previously had Z-table limits. For an additional 11 substances,OSHA is reducing the 8-hour TWA limit, and in 13 cases, the Agency is retainingits 8-hour limit and adding a STEL to supplement the TWA. OSHA is deletingthe 8-hour TWA limit and adding a ceiling in the case of acetic anhydrideand deleting a ceiling limit and adding an 8-hour TWA for another substance.For one substance, OSHA proposed a reduction in the TWA PEL, but, aftercareful review of the scientific evidence and rulemaking record, the Agencyhas decided to retain the existing limit. Table C12-1 shows these substances,their CAS and HS numbers, and their former, proposed, and final rule limits.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M007</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) O 1075-1081</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Description of the Health EffectsThe health effects associated with occupational exposures to the diversegroup of substances shown in Table C12-1 vary widely, ranging from sensoryirritation, systemic toxicity, ocular effects, and neuropathy to renaland liver damage. This variation in target organs reflects the fact thatthe substances in this group have not been grouped on the basis of similarityin toxic effects, target organs, or mechanism of action; instead, theyare considered together because the specific limits being established forthem have been set on the basis of toxic effects caused by exposure toanalogous chemicals. Table C12-2 shows these substances, along with theiradverse health effects and the substances with which they share structuralsimilarities.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M007</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) O 1083-1089</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>The use of structural analogy is a reasonable methodology for limit-settingbecause of the similarities in structure and activity between each substancein this grouping and at least one other toxic substance. Industrial hygienistsand toxicologists frequently use this approach when dealing with lesser-knownsubstances either in the workplace or the laboratory. The limits for thesubstances in this grouping have been set based on dose-response informationfor other compounds that have a similar chemical structure or that areknown to have a similar mechanism of action. For example, limits are beingestablished for a number of substances that are known cholinesterase inhibitors(including diazinon, disulfoton, and monocrotophos); however, since directdose-response data are not available for these substances specifically,OSHA has established limits that are similar to the final rule's limitfor parathion, another cholinesterase inhibitor for which adequate dose-responsedata are available.It is important to note that the establishment of a limit on the basisof analogy to other substances does not reflect a lack of information showingthat the substance is toxic; acute animal data are available to demonstratethe toxicity of all of the substances for which limits are being establishedin this category, and, for several substances, there are case reports ofhuman poisonings caused by exposure. Thus the limits established for thesesubstances reflect much more than a theoretical consideration of chemicalstructure and physiologic reaction: the hazardous nature of exposure toevery substance in this category has been demonstrated beyond doubt, althoughthe precise level at which these effects will occur cannot be foretoldwith certainty.The following sections describe the record evidence and OSHA's findingsfor the substances in this grouping. They also discuss the material healthimpairments likely to occur as a consequence of occupational exposure tothese substances.<ITAG tagnum="71">ACETIC ANHYDRIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-24-7; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>CO)<T2>2</T2>O </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1030</ITAG>The former OSHA PEL for acetic anhydride was 5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. TheACGIH has a TLV of 5 ppm as a ceiling, based on analogy with acetic acid's(TLV = 5 ppm ceiling) irritant potential. The proposed PEL was 5 ppm asa ceiling, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table Nl) concurs with this limit, whichis established by the final rule. Acetic anhydride is a colorless, mobile,strongly refractive liquid with a strong odor.In one study, rats inhaling 1000 ppm of acetic anhydride for four hourssurvived, but 2000 ppm was fatal (Smyth 1956/Ex. 1-759). In human studies,eye, nose, and throat irritation has been observed, and it has been suggestedthat bronchial and lung injury may occur as a consequence of exposure (Hendersonand Haggard 1943j, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 5). Skin burns andserious corneal injury have been reported in industrial settings when workerscame into contact with the liquid (McLaughlin 1946/Ex. 1-641), and aceticanhydride is a marked lacrimator (Fairhall 1949b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 5).In light of acetic anhydride's potential for acute toxicity, OSHA is replacingthe former 5-ppm 8-hour TWA with a 5-ppm ceiling. The Agency concludesthat this limit will protect workers from the significant risk of ocularand respiratory effects associated with high, short-term exposures to aceticanhydride at the former level. Ocular and respiratory effects constitutematerial impairments of health. The final rule's limit will substantiallyreduce these risks among industrially exposed workers.<ITAG tagnum="71">ACRYLIC ACID</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 79-10-7; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2> = CHCO<T2>2</T2>H</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1009</ITAG>Previously, OSHA had no permissible exposure limit for acrylic acid. TheACGIH has an 8-hour TLV-TWA of 10 ppm. The propsed PEL was 10 ppm as an8-hour TWA, and the final rule establishes this limit and adds a skin notation.Acrylic acid is a colorless, corrosive liquid with a distinctive acridodor.Acrylic acid is known to polymerize explosively with amines, ammonia, oleum,and chlorosulfonic acid, and it is incompatible with strong alkalis andpure nitrogen. Occupational exposure to acrylic acid usually occurs whenthe chemical is used in the form of methyl, ethyl, or butyl esters in themanufacture of acrylic resins.Data indicate that the oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is between 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg (Dow Chemical Company1977f, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 14), and the skin absorptionLD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 0.95 ml/kg (Smyth, Carpenter, Weil et al. 1962/Ex.1-441). Another study indicates that rabbits given acrylic acid orallyhad no ill effects at a level of 0.025 mg/kg (Klimkina et al. 1969, ascited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 14), and Gage (1970/Ex. 1-318) reportsthat rats exposed to 80 ppm for 6 hours daily for 20 days showed no adverseeffects.Case reports indicate that acute exposures to acrylic acid in workers havecaused skin burns, eye burns, and upper respiratory effects (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 14). OSHA received a comment from the Basic Acrylic Monomer Manufacturers(Ex. 184) supporting the proposed 10-ppm TWA limit. The New Jersey Departmentof Health (Ex. 144) discussed acrylic acid in connection with the Department'srecommendation that OSHA use EPA's IRIS data as the basis for limit-setting;OSHA has discussed this approach in Section VI.A of this preamble. NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N2) believes that the limit being established by OSHAfor acrylic acid should be lower, based on recent studies demonstratingdegeneration of the nasal mucosa, changes in pulmonary function, and skinabsorption (miller, Ayres, Jersey, and Mckenna 1981 and Silver, Leith,and Murphy 1981, both as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p 14.1). OSHA isaware of the recent literature on acrylic acid and will continue to monitorit in the future.OSHA concludes that an 8-hour TWA PEL of 10 ppm and a skin notation arenecessary to protect workers from the significant risk of nasal and eyeirritation, which constitute material health impairments that are potentiallyassociated with exposure to acrylic acid at levels above the new limit.The Agency has determined that this limit will substantially reduce thisrisk and prevent recurrences of the burns and irritation previously associatedwith industrial exposures to acrylic acid.<ITAG tagnum="71">ALUMINUM (ALKYLS)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7429-90-5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Chemical Formula: Al</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

No. 1018</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no permissible exposure limits for either the solublesalts of aluminum or the aluminum alkyls. The ACGIH has an 8-hour TLV-TWAlimit of 2 mg/m \3\ for aluminum (soluble salts) and 2 mg/m\3\ for thealuminum alkyls. The proposed PELs were 2 mg/m\3\ for both groups of aluminumcompounds. and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table Nl) concurred that these limits wereappropriate. The final rule establishes a 2-mg/m\3\ 8-hour TWA PEL forthe aluminum alkyls and the soluble salts of aluminum.The ACGIH's limits for aluminum soluble salts have been set on the basisof the amount of hydrolized acid, such as hydrochloric acid or sulphuricacid, in their acid compounds. For example, three mols of hydrogen chloride(HCl) hydrolize from one mol of aluminum chloride; since HCl has a PELof 5 ppm, a PEL of 2 mg/m\3\ for aluminum chloride (which is a solublesalt of aluminum) would provide the same degree of protection from irritationas that provided by this limit for HCl. The acute toxicity of aluminumchloride is generally representative of the toxicity of all of the solublesalts of aluminum. For the aluminum alkyls, toxicity data are sparse. However,all of the nonhalo- genated alkyls decompose into aluminum oxide fume,and the halogenated alkyls are even more irritating because of acid hydrolysis.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 2 mg/m\3\,for both the soluble salts of aluminum and the aluminum alkyls. The Agencyconcludes that these limits will protect against the significant risk ofirritation and skin burns, which constitute material health impairmentsthat are associated with exposures at levels above the new PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">BORON TRIBROMIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 10294-33-4; Chemical Formula: BBr<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1040</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no limit for exposure to boron tribromide. The ACGIHhas a 1-ppm ceiling limit for boron tribromide, which is a colorless, fumingliquid that is decomposed by water and alcohol. The proposed PEL, withwhich NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table Nl) concurred, was a ceiling of 1 ppm; thislimit is established in the final rule.Boron tribromide has a high potential for acute local irritation, and itspotential for systemic toxicity is analogous with that of hydrogen bromide(HBr). On decomposition, one molecule of boron tribromide would be expectedto produce three molecules of HBr (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 62).Animals repeatedly exposed to boron tribromide develop pneumonia, and exposureto 100 ppm caused a uniformly high mortality rate in animals from six laboratoryspecies (Stokinger, Spiegel et al. 1953, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 63). Rats, rabbits, and mice exposed at 1.5, 3.4, or 12.8 ppm borontrifluoride developed pneumonitis and dental fluorosis, although, at thelowest level tested, the evidence of pneumonitis was described as ``marginal''(Torkelson, Sadek, and Rowe 1961, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 63).Based on this evidence of boron tribromide's severe pulmonary toxicityat exposure levels of 3.4 ppm, OSHA is establishing a ceiling limit of1 ppm. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workers from thesignificant risk of serious pulmonary damage, a material health impairmentthat is associated with exposure to this substance at levels above thenew PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">BROMINE PENTAFLUORIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7789-30-2; Chemical Formula: BrF<T2>5</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1043</ITAG>OSHA had no former limit for bromine pentafluoride. The ACGIH has TLV-TWAof 0.1 ppm. The proposed PEL was 0.1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, and NIOSH (Ex.8-47, Table N1) concurs with this limit. The final rule promulgates a 0.1-ppm8-hour TWA PEL for bromine pentafluoride. This substance is a pale yellowliquid at temperatures below 40.3anddegrees;C; above this temperature, isa colorless, pungent, corrosive gas.Bromine pentafluoride has been shown to be acutely toxic in animals. Animalsexposed to bromine pentafluoride vapor at 500 ppm exhibited immediate symptomsof gasping, swollen eyelids, clouded corneas, tearing, salivation, andacute distress; these symptoms appeared after exposure for a period asshort as three minutes. Exposures to 50 ppm were fatal after 30 minutes,and chronic exposure above 3 ppm resulted in severe nephrosis (in someanimals), as well as marked hepatosis and severe respiratory involvement(The Matheson Co., Inc., as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 66). Brominepentafluoride is toxicologically more active than free, elemental fluorine,and its toxicity appears to be closely related to that of chlorine trifluoride(Horn and Weir 1955/Ex. 1-592; Horn and Weir 1956, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 66). Chlorine trifluoride has caused severe toxicity and some fatalitiesin dogs and rats exposed over a period of six months to an average concentrationof 1.17 ppm for six hours daily (Horn and Weir 1955/Ex. 1-592).In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a PEL of 0.1 ppm as an 8-hour TWAto prevent the significant risk of serious systemic injury potentiallyassociated with exposure to this substance at levels above the new limit.The Agency concludes that this limit will substantially reduce this riskof systemic toxicity, which constitutes a material impairment of health.<ITAG tagnum="71">n-BUTYL ACRYLATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 141-32-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>7</T2>H<T2>12</T2>O<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PEL, with which HIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) concurs, was 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, and this limit is promulgatedby the final rule, n-Butyl acrylate is a colorless, flammable liquid.n-Butyl acrylate is a skin and eye irritant and is toxic to animals. TheLC<T2>50</T2> for a 4-hour exposure was 1000 ppm (Carpenter, Weil, and Smith1974/Ex. 1-304). In rabbits, the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> for n-butyl acrylate is approximately 1800 mg/kg, comparedwith 1235 mg/kg for methyl acrylate (Smyth, Carpenter, and Weil 1951/Ex.1-439). n-Butyl acrylate has also been found to be mildly irritating tothe skin and to produce corneal necrosis in the unwashed eyes of rabbits(Holland 1974, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 75).At the rulemaking hearing, Dr. Isadore Rosenthal from Rohm and Haas wasasked to submit to the docket any information on butyl acrylate that Rohmand Haas had in its possession and had not previously transmitted eitherto the ACGIH or to OSHA. In response. Dr. Rosenthal (Ex. 112) submitteda 1974 internal memo reporting on butyl acrylate's overall toxicity. Thesedata report, among other things, that the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits for this substance is about 1800/ mg/kg (Ex. 112).In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 10 ppm forn-butyl acrylate, based on the similarity of the toxicological responseof n-butyl acrylate to methyl acrylate, for which OSHA also has a 10-ppmTWA limit. The Agency concludes that this limit is necessary to reducethe significant risk of skin irritation and corneal necrosis, which constitutematerial health impairments.<ITAG tagnum="71">o-sec-BUTYLPHENOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 89-72-5; Chemical Formula: C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>(CH<T2>3</T2>)CHC<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>OH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PEL was an 8-hour TWA of 5ppm, with a skin notation; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs with thislimit, which is established in the final rule. o-sec-Butylphenol is a colorlessliquid.Animal studies indicate that contact with o-sec-butylphenol causes irritationof the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract, and may result in skin burns.A Dow Chemical Company study (1977i, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.84) showed that the oral and skin absorption LD<T2>50</T2>s for guinea pigs ranged between 0.6 and 2.4 g/kg. Prolongedcontact of o-sec-butylphenol with the skin of these animals resulted inburns, whereas direct application to the eyes did not cause corneal injury.The oral LD<T2>50</T2> for rats is 2700 mg/kg (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>6th ed., Sax 1984),and rats exposed to saturated air levels of this chemical survived forseven hours (Dow Chemical Company 19771, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 84). The intravenous LD<T2>50</T2> for mice is 6 mg/kg (Sax 1984). Acute workplace exposure too-sec-butylphenol have resulted in mild respiratory irritation and skinburns (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 84).In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 5 ppm foro-sec-butylphenol, with a skin notation. The Agency concludes that thislimit is necessary to protect workers from the significant risks of eyeand respiratory tract irritation and skin burns associated with exposureto this substance at the levels formerly permitted by the absence of anOSHA limit. Eye and mucous membrane irritation and skin burns constitutematerial health impairments within the meaning of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="71">CALCIUM HYDROXIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1305-62-0; Chemical Formula: Ca(OH)<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1059</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no limit for calcium hydroxide; the ACGIH has a TLV-TWAof 5 mg/m\3\. In the proposal, the PEL was 5 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA,and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this limit. The final rulepromulgates an 8-hour TWA PEL of 5 mg/m\3\ for calcium hydroxide. Calciumhydroxide is a soft, white, odorless, crystalline powder with an alkaline,bitter taste.Calcium hydroxide is a moderate to severe caustic irritant when it comesin contact with the skin, eyes, or mucous membranes of the upper respiratorytract (ACGIH 1986/EX. 1-3, p. 92; Sax and Lewis 1989, p. 682). The oralLD<T2>50</T2> in rats is reported to be 7.34 g/kg (Smyth, Carpenter, Weilet al. 1969/Ex. 1-442). Industrial experience with this substance has notshown a high incidence of adverse health effects, although Sax (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>6th ed., 1984) reportsthat it is known to cause dermatitis (p. 621). Calcium hydroxide is alsomutagenic (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>7th ed., Sax andLewis 1989, p. 682). Calcium hydroxide has less alkalinity than the hydroxidesof the alkali series, and the ACGIH has suggested that limits for exposuresto calcium hydroxide should be based on its total alkalinity.OSHA received only one comment other than NIOSH's on calcium hydroxide.The National Lime Association (NLA) (Ex. 3-890) raised several issues relatedto this substance. First, the NLA argues that the health evidence for calciumhydroxide does not support a PEL of 5 mg/m\3\ for this substance. Accordingto the NLA, the oral toxicity study described by OSHA in the proposal hasno relevance to airborne lime exposures (Ex. 3-890, p. 13). In addition,the NLA believes that calcium hydroxide should be regulated as a nuisancedust, with a PEL of 10 mg/m\3\. OSHA does not agree that calcium hydroxideis a biologically inert substance. The Agency agrees with Sax (1984), whoreports that, ``in the form of dust, it \1/2\ calcium hydroxide \3/4\ isconsidered to be an important industrial hazard.'' OSHA finds that a PELof 5 mg/m\3\, half that of the inert particulate limit, is appropriatefor this well-known eye, skin, and upper respiratory tract irritant.The NLA's second point is that the monitoring methods available for measuringworkplace exposures to lime are inadequate to distinguish between ``differentcompounds of calcium'' because they are ``element- not compound-specific''(Ex. 3-890). OSHA's decision in the final rule to establish 5-mg/m\3\ limitsfor both calcium oxide and calcium hydroxide (see the discussion belowfor calcium oxide) should eliminate this problem for affected employers.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit for calciumhydroxide of 5 mg/m\3\ to protect against the significant risk of skin,eye, and mucous membrane irritation, which are material impairments ofhealth that are caused by exposure to this substance at levels above thenew PEL. The Agency concludes that this limit will reduce these risks substantially.<ITAG tagnum="71">CALCIUM OXIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1305-78-8; Chemical Formula : CaO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1060</ITAG>OSHA's former 8-hour TWA permissible exposure limit for calcium oxide was5 mg/m\3\, and the proposal contained a revised 8-hour TWA PEL of 2 mg/m\3\for this substance. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this proposal.This revised limit was consistent with the ACGIH TLV for calcium oxide,which was set on the basis of analogy with sodium hydroxide, a widely recognizedsensory irritant. The final rule retains OSHA's former 5-mg/m\3\ 8-hourTWA PEL for calcium oxide, for the reasons discussed below.Calcium oxide (lime) is produced when limestone is calcined to drive offcarbon dioxide. Calcium oxide is used as a refractory material; as a fluxin steelmaking; as a binding agent in building, pulp and paper manufacture,sugar refining, and leather tanning; as the raw material for chlorinatedlime bleaching powder, and as a soil treatment in agriculture (<T3>Encyclopedia of Occupational Health and Safety, </T3>Vol. 2, p. 1234,International Labour Office 1983).The amount of information that has been published specifically about calciumoxide's toxicological effects in animals or humans is limited, which accountsfor the ACGIH's reliance on the similarity in action between calcium oxideand sodium hydroxide in establishing a TLV of 2 mg/m\3\ for calcium oxide.The National Lime Association (NLA) (Ex. 3-890) and the American Iron andSteel Institute (Tr. p. 11-130 to 11-131; Ex. 188) objected to the comparisonof calcium oxide's properties with those of sodium hydroxide; accordingto the NLA, ``no qualitative or quantitative analysis is offered [in theproposal] to support the use of this analogy.'' OSHA's analysis of thisissue is discussed below.In direct contact with tissues, calcium oxide can result in burns and severeirritation because of its high reactivity and alkalinity. The major complaintsof workers exposed to lime consist of irritation of the skin and eyes,although inflammation of the respiratory passages, ulceration and perforationof the nasal septum, and even pneumonia have been attributed to inhalationof the dust (ACGIH 1986/ Ex. 1-3, p. 92). The Pennsylvania Department ofHealth reported that strong nasal irritation occurred as a consequenceof exposure to a mixture of calcium-oxide-containing dusts at a concentrationof approximately 25 mg/m\3\, but that exposure to concentrations of 9 to10 mg/m \3\ produced no observable irritation (Wands 1981a, in <T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology, </T3>3rd rev. ed., Vol.2B, p. 3054). By comparison, exposure to airborne sodium hydroxide at aconcentration of between 0.005 and 0.7 mg/m\3\ produced burning/rednessof the nose, throat, or eyes in workers engaged in cleaning operations(Hervin and Cohen 1973/EX. 1-945, as cited in NIOSH 1976k/Ex. 1-965). Thus,the demonstrated effect level for sensory irritation caused by exposureto sodium hydroxide is below 1 mg/m\3\, while that for calcium oxide isabove 9 mg/m\3\.OSHA finds that analogy with sodium hydroxide is not an appropriate basisfor establishing a PEL for calcium oxide, because there is nearly a tenfolddifference in the no-effect levels for these two substances. Based on evidencethat exposure to calcium oxide at levels above 9 mg/m\3\ may cause eye-tearingand mucous membrane irritation, OSHA concludes that the Agency's formerlimit of 5 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA continues to be appropriate for thissubstance. The Agency concludes that this limit protects exposed workersfrom the significant risk of sensory irritation known to occur at concentrationsof 9 to 10 mg/m\3\.<ITAG tagnum="71">CARBONYL FLUORIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 353-50-4; Chemical Formula: COF<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1074</ITAG>OSHA had no former limit for carbonyl fluoride. The ACGIH has an 8-hourTWA limit of 2 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of 5 ppm for this colorless andessentially odorless gas. The proposed PELs were an 8-hour TWA of 2 ppmand a 15-minute STEL of 5 ppm. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred withthese limits, and they are established in the final rule. The 1-hour LC<T2>50</T2> for rats is 360 ppm, and the 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> for the same species is 90 ppm (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 111).Carbonyl fluoride hydrolyzes instantly on contact with moisture. The ACGIH(1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 14) reports that carbonyl fluoride is ``about as toxicas hydrogen fluoride as a respiratory irritant gas.'' Repeated exposure of animals to carbonyl fluoride is known to have metaboliceffects; it inhibits the fluoride-sensitive enzyme succinic dehydrogenasevia hydrolysis of carbonyl fluoride to hydrogen fluoride (Scheel, McMillan,and Phipps 1968/Ex. 1-364). Carbonyl fluoride is also a strong irritantto the eyes, skin, mucous membranes, and respiratory tract (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>6th ed., Sax 1984).The only comment on carbonyl fluoride came from NIOSH. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 2 ppm anda 15-minute 5-ppm STEL for carbonyl fluoride; these limits are based onanalogy with the 3-ppm TWA limit being established for hydrogen fluoride.The Agency concludes that both a TWA and a STEL are necessary to provideprotection against the significant risks of marked irritation and metaboliceffects, which constitute material health impairments that are associatedwith exposure to carbonyl fluoride at levels above the new PELs. <ITAG tagnum="71">CATECHOL (PYROCATECHOL) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 120-80-9; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>(OH)<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1075 </ITAG>OSHA formerly had no established limit for catechol. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWAof 5 ppm. the proposed PEL was 5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47,Table N1) concurs with this limit, which is established in the final rule.In addition, the Agency has added a skin notation for this substance, inaccordance with its policy on skin designations, as discussed in SectionVI.C.18. Catechol is a colorless crystalline solid that sublimes readilyand thus occurs in the vapor state at room temperature. Catechol is approximately 1.1 to 2.2 times more toxic than phenol, dependidngon the route of exposure (Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories 1974, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 112). The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is 300 mg/kg, or approximately half that of phenol.Percutaneous toxicity for catechol in rabbits is 800 mg/kg, only slightlygreater than the value for phenol. OSHA notes that phenol has a skin designationand that catechol's dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits of 0.8 g/kg places this substance in the categoryof ``toxic'' by the percutaneous route of administration, as discussedin Section VI.C.18. In addition, the Agency is concerned by reports ofcentral nervous system effects (i.e., convulsions) in humans as a resultof skin absorption that are ``more marked'' than those produced by phenol(Deichmann and Keplinger 1981, in <T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology, </T3>3rd rev. ed., Vol.2A, p. 2586). OSHA is therefore adding a skin notation to the final limitfor catechol to protect workers from the serious CNS effects that may potentiallyoccur from percutaneous absorption of this substance. Eye and nose irritation,as well as muscular spasms and tremor, have been observed in rats at aconcentration of 2800 mg/m3 catechol, indicating that the acute respiratorytoxicity of catechol is approximately one-third that of phenol (IndustrialBio-Test Laboratories 1974, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.112). Metabolicdata indicate that the urinary elimination rate of catechol in rabbitsis only 10 percent that of phenol (Williams 1959/Ex.1-1176). In mice, catecholis easily absorbed through the skin and gastrointestinal tract (Forsythand Quesnel 1957/Ex. 1-978). Additional data document a variety of dermal,respiratory, and systemic toxicities that are closely analogous to thoseof phenol in their metabolic actions (Harold, Nierenstein, and Roaf 1910/Ex.1-1111; Dietering 1938/Ex. 1-1019; Cushny et al. 1940, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 112). Exposure to catechol causes an increase in blood pressure, and, at highdoses, kidney damage, eczematous dermatitis, and systemic illness (Harold,Nierenstein, and Roaf 1910/Ex. 1-1111; Dietering 1938/Ex. 1-1019; Cushnyet al. 1940, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.112). OSHA received no comments,except for those from NIOSH, on catechol. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a permissible exposure limit of5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA for this substance with a skin notation. The Agencyconcludes that these limits will protect workers against the significantrisks of dermal, upper respiratory tract, convulsions, and central nervoussystem effects (i.e., convulsions), all of which constitute material impairmentsof health that are potentially associated with exposure to catechol atlevels above the new PEL. <ITAG tagnum="71">1-CHLORO-1-NITROPROPANE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 600-25-9; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CHClNO <T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PEL was 2 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, and NIOSH(8-47, table N1) concurs with this limit. The final rule promulgates a2-ppm 8-hour TWA PEL for 1-chloro-1-nitropropane.1-Chloro-1-nitropropane is the most acutely toxic of the fungicides knownas the chloronitropropanes. In an inhalation experiment, two rabbits wereexposed for six hours to a concentration of 393 ppm, after which one rabbitdied; at an average concentration of 2574 ppm, both rabbits died. Guineapigs tested under the same conditions survived these exposures. The oralLD<T2>50</T2> for rabbits determined in the same study was between 50 and100 mg/kg (Machle, Scott, Treon et al. 1945/Ex. 1-349). Other members ofthis family of fungicides show lesser skin and lung irritation but do havehigher ingestion toxicities (Patty 1963i, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p.132). Exposure to high concentrations of 1-chloro-1-nitropropane cancause heart muscle, liver, and kidney damage (Patty 1963i, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 132). OSHA received no comments on this substance,except for those from NIOSH. The ACGIH considers chloronitropropane tobe more toxic than nitropropane, for which a TLV-TWA of 25 ppm has beenestablished. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 2 ppm. TheAgency concludes that this limit will protect exposed employees from thesignificant risk of skin and upper respiratory tract irritation and ofsystemic toxicity, which constitute material health impairments that arepotentially associated with 1-chloro-l-nitropropane exposure at the formerPEL. <ITAG tagnum="71">COBALT CARBONYL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 10210-68-1; Chemical Formula: Co<T2>2</T2>(CO)<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PEL was 0.1 mg/m3 as an 8-hourTWA, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs with this limit, which is establishedby the final rule. Sax (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>6th ed., 1984) reportsthat cobalt carbonyl has a moderate-to-high order of toxicity by the oralroute. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in mice is 377.7 mg/kg; in rats, it is 753.8 mg/kg (Spiridonovaand Shabalina 1973/Ex. 1-1098). The hazards of exposure to the metal carbonylsrange from relatively low (for iron pentacarbonyl) to extremely serious(for nickel carbonyl) (Stokinger 1981e, in <T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology, </T3>3rd rev. ed., Vol 2A,pp. 1797-1806); the greater the toxicity of the metal and the more stableand volatile the carbonyl, the more hazardous the compound. Exposure toany of the metal carbonyls causes the same symptoms of nausea, dizziness,headache, substernal pain, coughing and dyspnea (Stokinger 1981e). Evidenceconcerning any chronic effects of long-term exposure is lacking (ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 145). Only NIOSH commented on this substance. In the final rule, OSHA establishes an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.1 mg/m3 TWAfor cobalt carbonyl to protect against the significant risk of headache,nausea, and pulmonary effects, which are material impairments of healththat are associated with occupational exposure to this substance at levelsabove the new PEL. The Agency concludes that this limit will substantiallyreduce these significant risks. <ITAG tagnum="71">COBALT HYDROCARBONYL </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 16842-03-8; Chemical Formula: HCo(CO)<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The final rule promulgates an 8-hour TWA PEL of0.1 mg/m3 (measured as cobalt) for cobalt hydrocarbonyl. Cobalt hydrocarbonyl is approximately half as toxic as nickel carbonylin terms of acute effects; in animals, it produces clinical signs and symptomsvery similar to those produced by nickel carbonyl (ACGIH TLV-TWA of 0.007mg/m3) and iron pentacarbonyl (ACGIH TLV-TWA of 0.8 mg/m3) (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 145). These include headache, dizziness, and, after a delay inonset, liver, brain, and lung damage. The 30-minute LC<T2>50</T2> in rats is 165 mg/kg (Palmes, Nelson, Laskin, and Kuschner1959/Ex. 1-430). There is no evidence of chronic toxicity or of carcinogenicity.In the final rule, OSHA establishes an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.1 mg/m3 forcobalt hydrocarbonyl.

The final rule establishes a 0.1-mg/m3 PEL, witha skin notation, for diazinon. Pure diazinon is a colorless liquid, butthe technical grade is pale yellow to dark brown in color and has a faintodor.Gaines (1960/Ex. 1-319) reports the acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> for male and female rats to be 108 and 76 mg/kg, respectively.Other reports set the acute oral LD<T2>50</T2>s in rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits at 76 to 150, 240 to 320,and 130 mg/kg, respectively (Association of American Pesticide ControlOfficials, Inc. 1969, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 172). Studiesfrom Hazleton Laboratories (1965, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 172)and Radeleff (1958/Ex. 1-434) have shown much greater susceptibility todiazinon in birds and calves, with the oral LD<T2>50</T2> being less than 10 mg/kg in some instances. The dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 400 mg/kg (RTECS 1983-84). However, susceptibilityto repeated doses is relatively consistent among species, with dogs showingsigns of poisoning at 9.3 mg/kg per day and rats showing complete inhibitionof red blood cell cholinesterase and marked inhibition of brain cholinesteraseat 50 mg/kg/day (Bruce, Howard, and Elsea 1955/Ex. 1-585). Monkeys werepoisoned at 5 mg/kg/day (Woodard, Woodard, and Cronin 1968/Ex. 1-458).Chronic feeding studies in rats have shown no chronic toxicity at 10, 100,and 1000 ppm. For many mammals, diazinon is less toxic than parathion (ACGIHTLV-TWA of 0.1 mg/m3), although this is not true under some circumstances(ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 172).In humans, Hays (1963/Ex. 1-982) reports that two patients were poisonedby a dermal diazinon dosage of about 1.1 mg/kg; however, Gassman (1957/Ex.1-901) reports no ill effects from an accidental ingestion of 30 mg/kg.One man received a dose of 250 mg/kg and recovered after treatment, whichincluded gastric lavage (Bockel 1967, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.172). In tests, Geigy (1966, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 172), foundthat a series of doses of 0.05 mg/kg/day for 28 days produced plasma cholinesteraseinhibition, and it has been suggested that the no-effect level for cholinesteraseinhibition in humans is 0.02 mg/kg/day. Skin absorption of diazinon occursreadily, and overexposures are associated with weakness, headache, blurredvision, salivation, sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps,slurred speech, and moist rales in the lungs (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 172).In the final rule, the Agency is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.1mg/m3, with a skin notation, for diazinon.

Four-hour inhalation exposures at 34 ppm and six-hourdaily exposures at 25 ppm for a total of 204 hours also did not kill rabbitsor guinea pigs. Skin and mucous membrane irritation were not produced atthe 25-ppm exposure level. At survival concentrations, the primary targetsof toxicity were the lungs, which showed edema, congestion, hemorrhage,and acute bronchitis. At lethal exposures, these investigators observedacute myocardial degeneration with interstitial edema, cloudy swellingof the liver with cellular degeneration, and tubular degeneration and interstitialedema of the kidney, as well as edema of the tufts of the glomeruli andkidney necrosis. The compound was also found to be a severe skin irritantwhen two applications were applied on two successive days (Machle, Scott,Treon et al. 1945/Ex. 1-349). The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 188) states thatdichloronitroethane is more toxic than the nonchlorinated nitroalkanes.The Workers Institute for Safety and Health (Ex. 116) questioned OSHA'sselection of an 8-hour TWA rather than ceiling limit for this substance.In response, OSHA notes that the final rule's lower TWA limit is protectivebecause the health effects of concern do not occur at the peak exposuresthat would be permitted by the revised 8-hour TWA PEL.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a PEL of 2 ppm TWA for 1,1-dichloro-1-nitroethane.The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workers against the significantrisk of irritation, lung injury, and liver and kidney damage, all materialhealth impairments that are associated with exposures at levels above therevised PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">p-DICHLOROBENZENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 106-46-7; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>Cl<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1125</ITAG>OSHA formerly had an 8-hour TWA limit of 75 ppm for p-dichlorobenzene.The ACGIH has a limit of 75 ppm TWA and a STEL of 110 ppm for this whitecrystalline material, which has a camphor-like odor. The ACGIH's limitrecognizes that the para isomer is somewhat less toxic than the ortho isomer,for which the ACGIH has established a ceiling limit of 50 ppm. The proposedPEL retained the 75-ppm TWA limit and added a STEL of 110 ppm; the finalrule establishes these limits. In animal studies, an injection of 0.005 gram of p-dichlorobenzene in ratscaused slight liver necrosis (Cameron, Thomas, Ashmore et al. 1937/Ex.1-471). The intraperitoneal injection LD<T2>50</T2> for rats has been reported as 2562 mg/kg (Zupko and Edwards1949/Ex. 1-878). The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in mice is 2950 mg/kg (Domenjoz 1946, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 179); for rats, the oral LD<T2>50</T2> is 2512 mg/kg (Varshavskaya 1970, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 179). Rabbits fed a daily dietary exposure of 5 grams developedopacity of the lens in 3 weeks (Berliner 1939/Ex. 1-175); this findingwas not confirmed, however, in repeated studies (Pike 1944/Ex. 1-656).Reports of a human inhalation exposure to unspecified levels of p-dichlorobenzenedescribe swelling of the feet, ankles, and hands after day-long use ofa mothproofing agent consisting of this substance (Clayton 1935/Ex. 1-306).Other reports describe cataracts caused by exposure to unspecified concentrationsof the vapor of p-dichlorobenzene (Berliner 1939/Ex. 1-715). Petit andChampaix (1948, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 179) report the caseof a woman who experienced tingling of the hands, vertigo, and loss ofweight from working for 18 months with a mixture of 90 parts p-dichlorobenzeneand 10 parts hexachloroethane (airborne concentration not specified). OSHA received three comments on p-dichlorobenzene: from NIOSH (Ex. 8-47),the Workers Institute of Safety and Health (WISH) (Ex. 116), and the HalogenatedSolvents Industry Alliance (HSIA) (Ex. 186). WISH simply pointed out thatthe ACGIH <T3>Documentation</T3> (1986/Ex. 1-3) entry for this substance includesfewer, and different, references from those relied on by the Agency forToxic Substances and Disease Registry (Ex. 116, Table 1), without furthercomment. The HSIA (Ex. 186, App. D) submitted a letter from EPA's ScienceAdvisory Board to Lee Thomas, Administrator of EPA (3/9/88). The letterpoints out that there is a scientific hypothesis to the effect that, formany halogenated organics (including p-dichlorobenzene), the mechanismcausing tumors in rats exposed to these substances may not be operativein humans (Ex. 186D). According to the HSIA, this hypothesis may have ``importantimplications for human health risk assessment'' (Ex. 186D, p. 2). On theother hand, NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6D) interprets the evidence for p-dichlorobenzeneto mean that it is a potential human carcinogen that deserves full Section6(b) rulemaking. OSHA will consider NIOSH's recommendation in light ofthe Agency's rulemaking priorities. In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA PEL of 75 ppm TWA andadding a STEL of 110 ppm for p-dichlorobenzene. The Agency concludes thatboth a TWA and a STEL are necessary to protect workers from the significantrisk of eye damage, vertigo, and neuropathic effects, which constitutematerial impairments of health that are associated with occupational exposureto p-dichlorobenzene at levels above the 8-hour TWA PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">DICHLOROMONOFLUOROMETHANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-43-4; Chemical Formula: CHCl<T2>2</T2>F</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1128</ITAG>OSHA formerly had a limit of 1000 ppm TWA for dichloromonofluoromethane(FC-21). The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 10 ppm for this colorless gas; thislimit is based on FC-21's similarity to chloroform in terms of hepatotoxiceffects. The proposed PEL for FC-21 was 10 ppm, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) concurs with this limit. The final rule promulgates an 8-hour TWA PELof 10 ppm for FC-21. FC-21 is considered more toxic than the related difluorinated methanes.The major health hazards associated with exposure to this substance areliver damage, cardiac sensitization, and narcosis. Freon-21 has a 4-hourLC<T2>50</T2> of 49,900 ppm in rats (Tappan and Waritz 1964, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 187). Within an hour, exposure to 100,000 ppm killedrats and guinea pigs (Weigard 1971/Ex. 1-1102); other tests with guineapigs and mice demonstrated that concentrations of 50,000 ppm and highercause unconsciousness or death (Nuckolls 1935, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 187; Booth and Bixby 1932/Ex. 1-1079). The clinical signs of overexposureinclude loss of coordination, tremors, narcosis, and prostration, as wellas possible lung and liver changes (Tappan and Waritz 1964, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 187). Two-week exposures of rats to 10,000 ppm for 6 hours daily caused hepaticfailure or marked liver damage (Trochimowicz, Moore, and Chiu 1977/Ex.1-34). A series of 90-day exposures of rats and dogs to concentrationsof 1000 and 5000 ppm dichloromonofluoromethane resulted in bilateral hairloss, cirrhosis, and excessive mortality in rats in both exposure levels;dogs exhibited weight loss at both levels, but mild liver changes wereobserved only at the 5000-ppm level (Trochimowicz, Lyon, Kelly, and Chiu1977, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 187). Another uncompleted studyreported liver pathology in rats repeatedly exposed for 90 days at 500ppm, and probable liver pathology from similar exposures to 200 ppm; nohepatic effects were observed after exposure to 50 ppm (Allied ChemicalCompany 1978, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 187). Two of 12 dogs exposed to 10,000 ppm FC-21 plus intravenous epinephrinedeveloped serious arrhythmia (Mullin, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.187). Dogs and monkeys (anesthetized) demonstrated tachycardia and hypotensionafter exposure to FC-21 at levels between 50,000 and 100,000 ppm; bronchoconstrictionwas observed at 25,000 ppm (Aviado and Smith 1975/Ex. 1-82; Belej and Aviado1975/Ex. 1-462). Anesthetized mice exposed to a concentration of 100,000ppm FC-21 showed arrhythmia and cardiac sensitization to epinephrine (Aviadoand Belej 1974/Ex. 1-615). Preimplantation loss has been reported in pregnantrats exposed to FC-21 at 10,000 ppm on days 6 through 15 of gestation (Belejand Aviado 1975/Ex. 1-462). OSHA received no comments other than NIOSH'son FC-21. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a TWA limit of 10 ppm for dichloromonofluoromethane.The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workers against the significantrisks of hepatotoxic effects, cardiac sensitization, and narcosis associatedwith expsoure to this substance. OSHA finds that these exposure-relatedeffects constitute material impairments of health within the meaning ofthe Act.<ITAG tagnum="71">DIETHYL KETONE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 96-22-0; Chemical Formula: C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>COC<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The oral LD<T2>50</T2> for diethyl ketone in rats is reported to be 2.14 g/kg. Fourof six rats died when exposed to diethyl ketone for four hours at 8000ppm (Smyth, Carpenter, Weil, and Pozzani 1954/Ex. 1-440). In general, thetoxicities of the methyl ketones increase with increasing molecular weight;diethyl ketone is somewhat less toxic than is methyl propyl ketone (TLV-TWAof 200 ppm) (NIOSH 1978f, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 199). Allof the ketones cause mucous membrane and eye and skin irritation. OSHAreceived no comments on diethyl ketone except those from NIOSH.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 200 ppm fordiethyl ketone, the same limit being proposed for methyl propyl ketone.The Agency concludes that this limit will reduce the significant risk ofeye and skin irritation, which are material health impairments that areassociated with exposure to diethyl ketone at levels above the new PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">DIETHYLENE TRIAMINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 111-40-0; Chemical Formula: (NH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>)<T2>2</T2> NH </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1138</ITAG>Formerly, OSHA had no limit for diethylene triamine (DETA). The ACGIH hasa TLV-TWA of 1 ppm, with a skin notation, for this strongly alkaline, hygroscopic,and somewhat viscous yellow liquid that smells like ammonia. The proposedPEL was 1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, with a skin notation, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47,Table N1) concurs with this limit. The final rule promulgates this 1-ppm8-hour TWA for diethylene triamine; however, the skin notation is not retained(see the discussion on skin notations in Section VI.C.18 of this preamble).The acute intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> values for DETA are reported to be 71 and 74 mg/kg for themouse and rat, respectively (Hine, Kodama, Anderson et al. 1958/Ex. 1-511).In the rat, the reported oral and percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> values are the same (1080 mg/kg); the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> for the rabbit is 1090 mg/kg (Smyth, Carpenter, and Weil 1949/Ex.1-528). Exposure to 300 ppm of diethylene triamine vapor for 8 hours failedto kill any of a group of exposed rats (Savitt 1955/Ex. 1-663). Sutton (1963/Ex. 1-1101) has reported that DETA causes severe corneal injury;solutions of 15 to 100 percent caused lasting corneal damage. If improperlycontrolled, the vapor and liquid cause sensitization of the respiratorytract and skin (American Industrial Hygiene Association 1960, as citedin ACGIH 1968/Ex. 1-3, p. 197). Dernehl (Ex. 1-728) demonstrated such sensitizationin a study reported in 1951.OSHA received no other comments on this substance. However, OSHA has carefullyreviewed the health evidence on the percutaneous toxicity of DETA and hasdetermined that a skin notation is not necessary for this substance (seethe discussion on skin notations in Section VI.C.18). The final rule thuscontains no skin notation for DETA.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 1 ppm fordiethylene triamine. The Agency concludes that this limit will protectworkers against the significant risk of skin and respiratory tract irritationand sensitization, all of which constitute material health impairmentsthat are associated with exposure to diethylene triamine at levels abovethe new PEL. <ITAG tagnum="71">DIPROPYL KETONE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 123-19-3; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>)<T2>2</T2>CO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposedPEL was 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurswith this limit, which is established by the final rule. Dipropyl ketone has a moderate oral and inhalation toxicity (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>6th ed., Sax 1984).In rats, the oral LD<T2>50</T2> is 3.35 g/kg, and the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 9.5 g/kg. Tests have indicated that rats inhaling2000 ppm for 4 hours survived, but at 4000 ppm all animals died (Carpenter,Weil, and Smyth 1974/Ex. 1-304). Methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) has a similaracute toxicity (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 221); OSHA is establishing a 50-ppm8-hour TWA and a 75-ppm STEL for MIBK. Only NIOSH submitted comments ondipropyl ketone. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 50 ppm TWAfor dipropyl ketone. The Agency concludes that this limit is necessaryto protect workers from the significant risk of narcosis and irritation,both material health impairments that are associated with exposures atlevels above the new PEL. <ITAG tagnum="71">DIQUAT</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 85-00-7; Chemical Formula: C<T2>12</T2>H<T2>12</T2>Br<T2>2</T2>N<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PEL was 0.5 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hourTWA, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs with this limit. The finalrule establishes 0.5 mg/m3 as the 8-hour TWA PEL for diquat. In most species, the acute oral toxicity of diquat is similar to that ofparaquat and ranges from 100 to 400 mg/kg in rats, mice, rabbits, and dogs.Cows experience more severe toxic effects, with an acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> or 30 mg/kg. The 24-hour percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is greater than 400 mg cation/kg; no skin irritationor other ill effects were demonstrated at this level (Clark and Hurst 1970/Ex.1-135; Rowe and Wright 1965, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 222). Ratsfed 1000 ppm daily (about 50 mg/kg/day) for two years survived; reducedfood intake and growth were the only consequences observed. At 500 ppm(about 25 mg/kg/day), the only ill effect observed was a pathologic changein the eye. A dietary level of 10 ppm (about 0.5 mg/kg/day) for two yearsdid not induce cataract formation, but cataracts do occur at higher levels,with pathology observed at the 500-ppm level; one in four animals demonstratedcomplete corneal opacity in one or both lenses after six months at the1000-ppm level. Cataract formation requires prolonged exposure and is notinduced by single high-level exposures (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 222). Unlike paraquat, diquat does not produce lung damage in exposed humansor animals. Acute poisoning may produce nonspecific respiratory distressas well as other nonspecific signs of poisoning. In humans, accidentalingestion has produced less toxic reactions than those associated withparaquat ingestion (Orepoulos and McEvoy 1969/Ex. 1-429). OSHA receivedno comments, other than NIOSH's, on diquat. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour PEL of 0.5 mg/m3 TWAfor diquat. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect against thesignificant risk of ocular damage, which constitutes a material healthimpairment that is associated with chronic exposure at levels above thenew PEL. <ITAG tagnum="71">DISULFOTON</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 298-04-4; Chemical Formula: C<T2>8</T2>H<T2>19</T2>O<T2>2</T2>PS<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PEL for disulfoton was0.1 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA; the final rule establishes this limit and addsa skin notation. Pure disulfoton is an oily, colorless liquid; the technicalgrade is a brown liquid. The acute toxicity of disulfoton is very high by all laboratory-testedroutes of administration. For weanling rats, the intraperitoneal LD<T2>50</T2> is reported to be 5.4 mg/kg; for adult rats, it is 9.4 mg/kg(Brodeur and Dubois 1963/Ex. 1-718). The acute dermal LD<T2>50</T2> is 6 mg/kg for adult female rats and 25 mg/kg for adult malerats (Gaines 1969/Ex. 1-320). The acute oral LD<T2>50</T2>s for male and female rats are reported as 6.8 mg/kg and 2.3mg/kg, respectively (Brodeur and Dubois 1964/Ex. 1-1015). Rats have demonstratedan acquired tolerance for disulfoton (Brodeur and Dubois 1964/Ex. 1-1015).Metabolically, disulfoton is highly fat-soluble, and the compound apparentlyinterferes with mixed-function oxidase activity in the same manner shownto be the case for parathion; with respect to median lethal doses, parathionand disulfoton are similar (Stevens et al. 1973, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 226).NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N2) noted that OSHA had inadvertently omitted theskin notation for the proposed limit for disulfoton. NIOSH points out thatthe studies described above for this substance clearly demonstrate thatdisulfoton ``is almost as toxic via the skin as when administered internally,''and further, that the 1986 ACGIH <T3>Documentation </T3>(Ex. 1-3, p. 226) includes a skin notation for thissubstance. On the basis of these comments, OSHA is including a skin notationfor disulfoton in the final rule. With the exception of NIOSH, no commentersubmitted evidence to the record on disulfoton.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL for disulfotonof 0.1 mg/m3, with a skin notation. The Agency concludes that this limitwill prevent the significant risk of acute toxicity and metabolic injury,which are material impairments of health that are associated with exposuresat levels above the new PEL.

The commercial grade of divinyl benzene is a pale-straw-coloredliquid; it contains all three isomers, but the meta isomer predominates.The oral LD<T2>50</T2> for rats is reported to be 4.1 g/kg, and an acute inhalationstudy showed no ill effects from a single seven-hour exposure at 351 ppm.However, repeated or prolonged contact with the liquid may cause skin burns(Dow Chemical Company 1977j, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 228).Industrial experience indicates that irritation of the respiratory system,skin, and eyes can result from inhalation exposures to divinyl benzene,but there are no data concerning chronic exposures in humans. No comments,other than those of NIOSH, were received on divinyl benzene.The final rule establishes a PEL of 10 ppm (8-hour TWA) for divinyl benzene.The Agency concludes that this limit will protect against the significantrisk of irritation to the respiratory tract, eyes, and skin; such irritationconstitutes a material impairment of health within the meaning of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="71">ENDOSULFAN</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 115-29-7; Chemical Formula: C<T2>9</T2>H<T2>6</T2>Cl<T2>6</T2>O<T2>3</T2>S</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The final rule establishes an 8-hour TWA PEL for endosulfanof 0.1 mg/m3, with a skin notation. Technical endosulfan is a tan, semi-waxysolid mixture; it may have a slight odor similar to that of sulfur dioxide.The insecticide, endosulfan, is similar in its acute oral toxicity to therelated insecticides aldrin and dieldrin (TLV-TWAs of 0.25 mg/m3), exceptthat it is slightly more toxic than these substances in female laboratoryanimals. In rats, the oral LD<T2>50</T2> for endosulfan is 43 mg/kg for males and 18 mg/kg for females(<T3>Farm Chemicals Handbook </T3>1974/Ex. 1-1147a). The dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in male and female rats are 130 mg/kg and 74 mg/kg, respectively(<T3>Farm Chemicals Handbook </T3>1974/Ex. 1147a). The respiratory LC<T2>50</T2> for male rats is 50 mg/kg for 4 hours of exposure (Associationof American Pesticide Control Officials, Inc. 1969, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 230).In laboratory tests of chronic exposure, rats tolerated oral doses of upto 3.2 mg/kg/day for 3 months without injury (Gaines 1975, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 230), and dogs tolerated doses up to 0.75 mg/kgfor 1 year (Ely, MacFarlane, Galen, and Hines 1967/Ex. 1-414). A 2-yeardietary level of 10 ppm (approximately 0.5 mg/kg/day) in rats was associatedwith a statistically insignificant decline in female survival rates andcaused a reduction in testis weights in males. At 5.0 mg/kg/day, histopathologicfindings showed renal tubular damage and some hydropic changes in rat livers(Czech 1958, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 230).Inhalation of endosulfan dust by humans has been associated with slightnausea, confusion, excitement, flushing, and dry mouth (State of California:Department of Industrial Relations/Ex. 1-8). Nine employees who had beenworking with 50-percent water-wettable endosulfan powder for only a fewdays had convulsions (Association of American Pesticide Control Officials,Inc. 1969, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 230). With the exceptionof NIOSH's comments, no evidence on endosulfan was submitted to the record.OSHA concludes that exposure to endosulfan poses a significant risk ofsystemic poisoning and renal and testicular damage, and the Agency thereforeis establishing a PEL of 0.1 mg/m3 TWA for endosulfan, with a skin notation;these effects constitute a material impairment of health within the meaningof the Act. OSHA finds that this limit will substantially reduce the significantrisk associated with exposure to this substance at the levels formerlypermitted by the absence of an OSHA limit.<ITAG tagnum="71">FONOFOS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 944-22-9; Chemical Formula: C<T2>10</T2>H<T2>15</T2>OPS<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PELwas an 8-hour TWA of 0.1 mg/m3, with a skin notation; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47,Table N1) concurs with this limit. The final rule's PEL for fonofos isan 8-hour TWA limit of 0.1 mg/m3, with a skin notation.In male rats, the average acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> of technical fonofos has been reported to be 13.2 mg/kg (StaufferChemical Co. 1974, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 275). For femalerats, an average oral LD<T2>50</T2> of 3 mg/kg has been reported (NIOSH 1974d). The acute dermalLD<T2>50</T2>s reported for rats and guinea pigs are 147 and 278 mg/kg, respectively(Weir and Hazleton 1981/Ex. 1-1135). Weir and Hazleton reported that nolocalized eye irritation occurred when 0.1 ml of technical fonofos wasinstilled into rabbit eyes; however, death resulted in these animals within24 hours after the instillation (1981/Ex. 1-1135). Dietary studies of ratslasting 105 weeks have shown 10 ppm (about 0.2 mg/kg) to be a no-effectlevel. Dogs fed fonofos for 14 weeks showed no-effect dietary levels of8 ppm; no carcinogenic effects were observed. Rats showed reproductiveeffects at dietary levels of 10 ppm and 31.6 ppm (about 0.7 mg/kg) (StaufferChemical Co. 1974, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 275).There are no reports of human poisonings caused by fonofos, although itis known to be a cholinesterase inhibitor (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 275).There were no comments, other than NIOSH's, on fonofos.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour PEL of 0.1 mg/m3 TWAfor fonofos to protect exposed workers from the significant risk of cholinesteraseinhibition that is characteristic of exposure to this and other organicphosphate pesticides. OSHA considers cholinesterase inhibition a materialimpairment of health. A skin notation is also established, based on evidencein animals that fonofos can readily penetrate the skin and cause death.The Agency concludes that these limits will substantially reduce this significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="71">FORMAMIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-12-7; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>NO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1182</ITAG>Previously, OSHA had no limit for formamide. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of20 ppm and a TLV-STEL of 30 ppm for this clear, viscous, odorless liquid.The proposed PELs were an 8-hour TWA of 20 ppm and a 15-minute STEL of30 ppm, and the final rule establishes these limits.Formamide has an LD<T2>50</T2> of approximately 6 g/kg for rats (Thiersh 1962/Ex. 1-690; Zaeva,Vinogradova, Savina, and Osipenko 1969/Ex. 1-1026). Dietary administrationat 1.5 g/kg for two weeks resulted in fatalities in rats; pathologic examinationrevealed cumulative changes characteristic of gastritis and malnutrition(E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Inc., as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 278). Czajkowska (1981, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 278)reports the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> for skin absorption in rabbits as 6 g/kg. Mild and transientirritation, but no allergic skin sensitization, occurred when formamidewas applied to the skin of guinea pigs (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>6th ed., Sax 1984;E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Inc., as cited in ACIGH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 278). Eye irritation tests in rabbits showed only slight, temporaryirritation (Carpenter and Smyth 1946/Ex. 1-303). No signs of toxicity inrats were detected in single six-hour exposures at 3900 ppm formamide dispensedas a mist, or in six-hour daily exposures for 10 days at approximately1500 ppm formamide vapor (equivalent to air saturated with formamide atroom temperature); no indications of organ damage were seen in these animalson pathologic examination (E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Inc., ascited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 278).Gross fetal malformations were not noted following dermal applicationsof formamide to the skin of pregnant rats; the effects that were observedwere weak and were produced at overwhelming concentrations (Stula and Krauss1977/Ex. 1-1068). The no-observed-effect level in a rabbit developmentaltoxicity study was 22 mg/kg orally (Merkle and Zeller 1980/Ex. 1-683).According to the ACGIH, there are no reports of industrial poisoning byformamide (E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Inc., as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 278).OSHA received comments on formamide from Grace Ziem (Ex. 46) and NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N2). Dr. Ziem, an occupational physician on the staffof Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health and the Universityof Maryland School of Medicine, believes that OSHA should revise the PELfor formamide to 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWA based on Grant's (1986/Ex. 1-975)statement that this substance causes Grade 4 eye irritation rather thanthe ``mild'' irritation reported by du Pont (as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 278). Dr. Ziem also notes that the ACGIH has dropped its STEL forformamide, lowered its 8-hour TWA PEL to 10 ppm, and added a skin notationfor this substance. In addition, consistent with the Agency's policy onskin notations (discussed in Section VI.C.18 of the preamble), OSHA isnot adopting the skin notation at the present time. The Agency concludesthat the 30-ppm STEL should be retained to ensure that workplace exposuresto formamide are not permitted to exceed the 8-hour TWA by any substantialmargin. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N2) does not concur with the limits proposedand points out that formamide is a testicular toxin and has been identifiedin mice as a teratogen. OSHA is aware of the developing literature on bothformamide and dimethyl formamide, and the Agency intends to monitor toxicologicaldevelopments on these chemicals closely in the future to determine whetherother action is necessary.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a PEL of 20 ppm TWA and a STELof 30 ppm for formamide. The Agency concludes that this limit will notonly protect workers against the significant risks of eye and skin irritation,but will substantially reduce the risks of other health effects that existas a consequence of workplace exposure to formamide at levels above thenew PELs. OSHA considers sensory irritation, testicular toxicity, and teratogenicitymaterial impairments of health within the meaning of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="71">GERMANIUM TETRAHYDRIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7782-65-2; Chemical Formula: GeH<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1186</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no limit for germanium tetrahydride. The ACGIH has aTLV of 0.2 ppm TWA for this colorless gas. The proposed PEL was an 8-hourTWA of 0.2 ppm, with which NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs. In the finalrule, the 0.2-ppm 8-hour TWA is established as OSHA's PEL for germaniumtetrahydride.An early study indicated that germanium tetrahydride has a toxicity betweenthat of tin hydride and arsine (Flury and Zernik 1931e/Ex. 1-993). In thisstudy, a rabbit survived exposure to 100 ppm for one hour. One-hour exposuresat 150 and 185 ppm caused fatalities in mice, and similar exposures involvingguinea pigs resulted in sickness at the 150-ppm level and death at 185ppm (Flury and Zernik 1931e/Ex. 1-993). On the other hand, Webster (1946/Ex.1-399) reported that germanium tetrahydride is less toxic than both tinhydride and arsine. The effect of exposure to germanium tetrahydride ishemolysis. Data concerning chronic or subacute toxicities are not available.Based on germanium's acute toxicity, which is approximately half that ofstibine, the ACGIH recommends an 8-hour TLV of 0.2 ppm TWA. OSHA receivedno comments, other than NIOSH's, on this substance.In the final rule, OSHA establishes a PEL of 0.2 ppm as an 8-hour TWA forgermanium tetrahydride to reduce the significant risk of hemolytic effects,which constitute material impairments of health that are associated withexposure to this substance at levels above the new PEL. The Agency concludesthat implementation of this limit will substantially reduce this significantrisk.<ITAG tagnum="71">INDENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 95-13-6; Chemical Formula: C<T2>9</T2>H<T2>8</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1212</ITAG>OSHA had no former limit for indene. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 10 ppmfor this colorless liquid. The proposed PEL was 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWA,a limit with which NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs. The final rule promulgatesan 8-hour TWA PEL for indene of 10 ppm.Early inhalation studies of indene reported injury to the spleen, liver,and kidney of rats exposed to indene vapor concentrations of 800 to 900ppm for six 7-hour periods (Cameron and Doniger 1939/Ex. 1-470). Some animalswere found at necropsy to have severe necrosis of the liver with hemorrhage;kidney necrosis was also observed. No other organ damage was found andno deaths occurred as a result of these exposures (Cameron and Doniger1939/Ex. 1-470). By analogy with the effects of exposure to other monoaromatichydrocarbons, exposure to indene is likely to irritate the mucous membranes.In laboratory animals, chemical pneumonitis, pulmonary edema, and hemorrhagehave resulted from the aspiration of indene liquid into the lung, and repeatedskin contact has caused dermatitis as a result of the defatting propertiesof indene (Gerarde 1960b/Ex. 1-738b). In dermal studies of rats, one toeight applications of 0.1 m1 to the shaved skin were reported to have noeffect; three applications of 0.5 ml to guinea pig skin also produced noeffect (Cameron and Doniger 1939/Ex. 1-470). The oral toxicity of indeneappears to be moderate, with adult rabbits tolerating a single dose of1 gram without signs of systemic toxicity (Gerarde 1960b/Ex. 1-738b). Subcutaneousinjection of 1 gram, however, caused liver pathology and fatalities; highoral doses (2.5 ml of a 1.1 v/v mixture in olive oil) were uniformly fatal,with characteristic liver, lung, and gastrointestinal changes. Chronicadministration of 3 mg/m\3\ indene for 105 days caused catalase inhibitionand stimulation of blood cholinesterase in rats, but no effects were observedin rats exposed at 0.6 mg/m\3\ (Dyshinevich 1976/Ex. 1-631). No comments(other than those from NIOSH) were received on this substance.The final rule establishes an 8-hour PEL of 10 ppm TWA for indene. OSHAconcludes that this level will reduce the significant risks of irritation,pulmonary effects, and systemic toxicity which may constitute materialimpairments of health that are associated with exposure to levels abovethe new PEL. <ITAG tagnum="71">IODOFORM</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-47-8; Chemical Formula: CHI<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PEL was 0.6 ppm as an 8-hour TWA; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) concurred with this limit, which is established by the final rule.The subcutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> for rabbits is 50 mg/kg, and the oral LD<T2>Lo</T2> for iodoform in dogs is 1000 mg/kg (Kutob and Plaa 1962/Ex.1-61). These authors also report that, on a molar basis, iodoform has anacute toxicity in mice similar to that of methyl iodide; this conclusionis based on parameters of lethality, barbiturate sleeping time, and bromsulphalein(BSP) retention time. An NCI bioassay (1978c/Ex. 1-1117) of iodoform indicatesthat the substance is not carcinogenic nor of high systemic toxicity, althoughhistopathological examination of laboratory animals in this bioassay wasjudged by NCI to be inadequate.No human data are available for this compound, and OSHA received no commentson this substance, other than those from NIOSH.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.6 ppmfor iodoform, based on the limit being established for methyl iodide (2ppm TWA); these limits are comparable on a molar iodine basis. OSHA concludesthat this limit will protect workers from the significant risks of irritationand hepatotoxicity, both material impairments of health that are associatedwith exposure to iodoform. The Agency has determined that this limit willsubstantially reduce these significant risks.<ITAG tagnum="71">ISOBUTYL ALCOHOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 78-83-1; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2>CHCH<T2>2</T2>OH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PEL was 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA; NIOSH (ex. 8-47,Table N1) concurs. The final rule establishes a 50 ppm 8-hour TWA PEL forisobutyl alcohol.Limited inhalation studies have reported a somewhat higher acute toxicityfor isobutyl alcohol than for n-butyl alcohol (which has a ceiling of 50ppm) (Smyth, Carpenter, and Weil 1951/Ex. 1-439; Smyth, Carpenter, Weil,and Pozzani 1954/Ex. 1-440). A 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> of 8000 ppm has been reported in rats for isobutyl alcohol.Ingestion studies in rabbits have reported an acute oral toxicity of 3.75g/kg for isobutyl alcohol (Smyth, Carpenter, and Weil 1951/Ex. 1-439; Smyth,Carpenter, Weil, and Pozzani 1954/Ex. 1-440). The dermal LO<T2>50</T2> is 4.2 g/kg (Stokinger 1976, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 331). Weese (1928/Ex. 1-1073) reported that the narcotic inhalationdose over a total of 136 hours is 6400 ppm in mice. Slight changes in theliver and kidneys were reported, but no fatalities occurred after repeatednarcotizing doses (Weese 1928/Ex. 1-1073).The effects of liquid isobutyl alcohol on the human eye appear to be comparableto those of n-butanol; no data are available on ocular exposure to theisobutyl alcohol vapor. Dermal application of isobutyl alcohol has causedslight erythema and hyperemia in humans (Schwartz and Tulipan 1939/Ex.1-1167; Oettel 1936/Ex. 1-921).OSHA received one comment on this substance in addition to NIOSH's; theMotor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA) (Ex. 3-902) lists isobutylalcohol as a substance for which, in the opinion of the MVMA, rulemakingshould be delayed. The MVMA provided no substantive information in supportof its position.In the final rule, OSHA is reducing the former 8-hour TWA PEL of 100 ppmto 50 ppm for isobutyl alcohol.

Slight irritation of the skin and eyes has been reported in animalsas a result of direct contact with this chemical (Dow Chemical Company1977k, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 338). No other data concerningchronic toxicity or human exposure are available (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.338).Chemical analysis shows N-isopropylaniline to have toxicologic propertiessimilar to those of its parent compound, aniline. The oral LD<T2>50</T2>s for the two chemicals are approximately equal. The ACGIH hasestablished the 2-ppm TLV-TWA for N-isopropylaniline on the basis of itsstructural analogy with aniline (which has a 2-ppm TLV-TWA) and N,N-dimethylaniline(which has a 5-ppm TLV-TWA and a 10-ppm STEL); exposure to these substanceshas been shown to cause hemolytic and central nervous system effects inanimals and humans. These substances are also toxic when absorbed throughthe skin. OSHA received only one comment, form NIOSH, on this substance.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour PEL of 2 ppm for N-isopropylaniline,with a skin notation.

The proposal retained the 8-hour TWA and addeda STEL of 1.5 ppm; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N-1) concurs. The final ruleretains an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.5 ppm and adds a STEL of 1.5 ppm for ketene.Ketene is highly irritating to the respiratory tract (Mendenhall and Stokinger1959/Ex. 1-428), and the effects of its action are delayed (Treon, Sigmon,Kitzmiller 194/Ex. 1-769).

Cronic exposure at 1 ppm for six monthson a schedule of six hours daily, five days per week, was tolerated byanimals of several species (Mendenhall and Stokinger 1960, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 341). Similar results have been reported in monkeysexposed repeatedly (55 exposures) for seven hours (Treon, Sigmon, and Kitzmiller1949/Ex. 1-769). Evidence strongly suggests that the development of emphysemaand fibrosis may occur in individuals who have developed a tolerance tothe acute effects of ketene exposure (Stokinger, Wagner, and Dobrogarski1957/Ex. 1-139. No comments other than NIOSH's were received on ketene.In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.5 ppm andadding a 15-minute STEL of 1.5 ppm for ketene. The Agency concludes thatworkers exposed to this highly irritating and toxic gas are at significantrisk of developing respiratory irritation, pulmonary edema, and other severeplumonary effects that constitute material health impairments. OSHA findsthat a TWA and STEL are required to protect against both acute and chronichealth effects.

OSHA proposedto retain the 8-hour PEL of 1000 ppm and to add a STEL of 1250 ppm, andthe final rule establishes these limits, with which NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) concurs. MAPP contains 58 percent of a mixture of propadiene (a colorless,unstable gas with a strong, unpleasant odor) and methyl acetylene (a colorlessgas with a sweet odor); the balance of the mixture consists of paraffinicand olefinic C<T2>3</T2> and C<T2>4</T2> hydrocarbons.Tests of rabbits, dogs, and guinea pigs exposed to an average concentrationof 5000 ppm for seven hours/day, five days/week for four months resultedin no adverse health effects except decreased lung weights. No changesat all were observed in animals exposed to 1000 ppm for four months (DowChemical Company 1964, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 368).On the basis of these data, which show MAPP to be a chemical mixture oflow toxicity in experimental animals, the Agency is retaining its 8-hourTWA PEL of 1000 ppm and adding a STEL of 1250 ppm.

The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workersfrom the significant risk of ocular and nasal irritation, pulmonary effects,and cholinesterase inhibition, all of which constitute material impairmentof health and are associated with exposure to this substance at levelsabove the new limit.<ITAG tagnum="71">METHYL ETHYL KETONE PEROXIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1338-23-4 Chemical Formula: C<T2>8</T2>H<T2>18</T2>O<T2>6</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No.: 1257</ITAG>OSHA did not formerly have a limit for methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP).The Agency proposed a PEL of 0.2 ppm (1.5 mg/m\3\) as a ceiling for thissubstance to protect workers against the significant risk of eye and skinirritation, as well as kidney and liver damage; this limit is consistentwith that of the ACGIH. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with thislimit. In the final rule, OSHA has determined that the data available atthe present time indicate that 0.7 ppm (approximately 5 mg/m\3\) is anappropriate level at which to establish a PEL, and the final rule establishesthis limit. MEKP is sold commercially as a colorless liquid mixture consistingof approximately 60 percent MEKP and 40 percent diluent; the diluent isadded to reduce MEKP's sensitivity to shock.The health effects data for MEKP in animals rely primarily on a study conductedin 1958 by Floyd and Stokinger (Ex. 1-783). In a series of experimentsconducted in rats, mice, and rabbits to determine the toxicity of MEKPby various routes of exposure, these investigators found that inhalationexposure for four hours to a concentration of 200 ppm was fatal to 50 percentof rats, and a four-hour exposure to 170 ppm was fatal to 50 percent ofmice. Inhalation of MEKP vapors produced petechial and gross hemorrhagesof the lungs in rats after four-hour exposures; liver and kidney damagewas also observed (Floyd and Stokinger 1958/Ex. 1-783). Two drops of a40-percent solution of MEKP in dimethyl phthalate caused severe damagewhen instilled in rabbits' eyes, but at 3 percent, a moderate, transientreaction was produced. The direct application of MEKP to closely shavedrabbit skin caused no immediate discomfort but did cause a severe delayedreaction, consisting of erythema, edema, and vesiculation within two orthree days; of the four organic peroxides tested (di-t-butyl peroxide,t-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and methyl ethyl ketone peroxide),MEKP exhibited the greatest toxicity. The maximal nonirritating strengthof MEKP applied dermally was 0.6 percent. In addition, rats died or showedmarked evidence of cumulative systemic effects after either oral or intraperitonealadministration of MEKP at 20 percent of the LD<T2>50</T2> level for three days/week for seven weeks (Floyd and Stokinger1958/Ex. 1-783). OSHA received several comments on the proposed PEL for MEKP (Exs. 8-47,8-86, 3-902, 144, 155, 181, and 3-1172; Tr. 11-265/266). Robert Schumacher,a certified industrial hygienist representing a group of six manufacturingcompanies (including the U.S. Marine Corporation), stated that the proposaldid not adequately demonstrate occupational risk for MEKP because it reliedon the findings of a single 30-year-old study that described the resultsof animal experiments involving ``novel and unusual'' exposures (Ex. 3-1172,Attachment; Exs. 86 and 155; Tr. 11-265/266). In addition, this commenterstated that information is lacking as to what concentrations of MEKP currentlyexist in the workplace, how to measure MEKP in the occupational environment,and the feasibility of engineering controls to regulate exposures to MEKP(Ex. 3-1172, Attachment; Exs. 8-86 and 155). The Motor Vehicle ManufacturersAssociation (MVMA) (Ex. 3-902) merely listed MEKP as a substance for whichrulemaking should be delayed; however, the MVMA provided no details insupport of this comment. The New Jersey Department of Health (Ex. 144)suggested that the limits for MEKP should be derived based on EPA's IRISdata; the use of IRIS data is discussed above, in Section VI.A of the preamble.In response to Mr. Schumacher and the National Marine Manufacturers Association(Exs. 8-86, 155, 3-1172, and 181; Tr. 11-265/266), OSHA notes that thestudy of MEKP's toxicity performed by Floyd and Stokinger (1958/Ex. 1-783)was a thorough and comprehensive bioassay involving three species (mice,rats, and rabbits) and five routes of exposure inhalation, intraperitoneal,oral, dermal, and eye contact). According to the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p.396), this study demonstrated that MEKP was ``20- to 50-fold more acutelytoxic than di-ti-butyl peroxide by all routes tested.'' The consequencesof exposure to this substance ranged from skin and eye irritation to grosshemorrhage of the lung and liver and kidney damage; OSHA notes that theseeffects were observed even after short-term exposures. The Floyd and Stokingerstudy (1958/Ex. 1-783) demonstrated that MEKP is significantly more toxicthan benzoyl peroxide (TLV-TWA of 5 mg/m\3\) and resembles hydrogen peroxide(TLV-TWA of 1.4 mg/m\3\) in terms of its potential to cause irritationon an acute basis. A study by Moskowitz and Grabois (1950, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 54) showed that exposure to 12.2 mg/m\3\ benzoylperoxide caused ``pronounced irritation of the nose and throat'' in workers;because MEKP is significantly more irritant than benzoyl peroxide, MEKPconcentrations considerably below the 12 mg/m\3\ level can be expectedto cause irritation as well. Sax and Lewis (1989, p. 2312) report that MEKP is an experimental tumorigenand note that systemic effects in humans resulting from oral exposure includechanges in the structure or function of the esophagus, nausea or vomiting,and other gastrointestinal effects. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) has carefully reviewedthe health effects information and the limits proposed for MEKP by OSHA.NIOSH concurs that a ceiling limit is appropriate for MEKP to protect againstthis substance's severe irritant effects (see Table N1 of Ex. 8-47). With regard to Mr. Schumacher's comments concerning concentrations of MEKPin the workplace and available controls, the record contains several NIOSHhealth hazard evaluations and technical assistance surveys taht were conductedin workplaces where MEKP was used as a reaction catalyst in polyester resinoperations, the same type of operation of concern to Mr. Schumacher (NIOSHHealth Hazard Evaluation Determination Report Nos. HE 79-132-673; HE 76-000-066;and HE 78-003-555). At two of the three sites surveyed, all personal andarea MEKP air samples were below 1.5-mg/m.\3\ At the third site, a totalof 20 short-term samples were taken over a three-day period to determineairborne MEKP exposures during the construction of fibrous glass reinforcedproducts utilizing the styrene-modified polyester resin sprayup processand a MEKP catalyst; eight of these short-term samples exceeded the 1.5-mg/m\3\(0.2-ppm) level (NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation Determination Report No.HE 78-003-555).Mr. Schumacher (Ex. 155) was also of the opinion that OSHA had failed,in either the proposal or its supporting documents, to take into accountthe fact that a facility having multiple exposures would have to designits engineering controls to handle multiple chemicals; in the opinion ofMr. Schumacher, to control for multiple chemicals in a facility would bemore expensive than controlling for a single substance. OSHA does not agreewith Mr. Schumacher on either point. As discussed in Section VII of thepreamble, OSHA's entire costing methodology is based on a process approachthat assumes multiple chemical exposures and the use of a system of engineeringcontrols designed to control the exposures of all employees involved inthe process. OSHA believes this is a reasonable costing methodology becausemultiple chemicals are used at most processes. For example, in the sectorof interest to Mr. Schumacher (SIC 37, Transportation Equipment), and particularlyin boat-building, styrene, fiberglass, and MEKP are all used. OSHA also conducted two site visits to MEKP-using facilities in connectionwith the present rulemaking (Exs. 136A and 136B). Both of the plants visitedproduced fiberglass boats, and personal samples were taken at both facilitiesfor workers involved in gel-coat and lamination operations. One plant wasa high-volume facility that produced approximately 24 boats per day, whilethe other plant produced only two to three boats per day. In the low-productionfacility, all MEKP sampling results for gel-coat and lamination workerswere below 1.5-mg/m3 for MEKP (Ex. 136A); at the high-production facility,the single MEKP sample taken on a gel-coat operator was 3.0 mg/m3 (Ex.136B). OSHA believes that the higher reading at the second facility isaccounted for by the high rate of production at that site; controllingexposures at a high-volume facility requires the implementation of additionalcontrols to compensate for the increase in production. In regard to sampling and analytical methods for MEKP, OSHA notes thatNIOSH has published a sampling and analytical method (PECA or 3508) forthis substance and that OSHA has developed an in-house method that is availablefrom the Agency on request; OSHA used this method without difficulty onthe two site visits to MEKP-using facilities conducted for this rulemaking.However, OSHA does find that the data in the record do not provide informationthat can be used to determine that 0.2 ppm (1.5 mg/m3) represents an appropriatelevel at which to establish the final rule PEL for MEKP. For example, theFloyd and Stokinger study reports that MEKP is ``20- to 50-fold more acutelytoxic than di-t-butyl peroxide by all routes tested''; however, there isno PEL or TLV for di-t-butyl peroxide for OSHA to use as a basis for thePEL. The same study notes that MEKP is significantly more toxic than benzoylperoxide (TLV-TWA of 5 mg/m3) and resembles hydrogen peroxide in toxicity(TLV-TWA of 1.5 mg/m3) but provides no data to suggest how this ``extra''toxicity might translate into a PEL. OSHA carefully reviewed the ACGIH(1986) documentation for this substance and also could find no specificbasis for a ceiling of 0.2 ppm (1.5 mg/m3). Accordingly, OSHA has concluded that, at this time, the available datasupport establishing a PEL for MEKP that is at least equivalent to thatfor benzoyl peroxide (i.e., 5 mg/m3, which is approximately equivalentto 0.7 ppm for MEKP). Given that MEKP is reported by Floyd and Stokingerto be more irritating than benzoyl peroxide and that irritation can resultfrom even very brief exposures to excessive concentrations of MEKP, OSHAalso concludes that a ceiling limit for MEKP is necessary and appropriate.Therefore, to reduce the significant risk of irritation to workers whoare exposed to MEKP at higher levels, OSHA is establishing a 0.7 ppm ceilingPEL for MEKP. <ITAG tagnum="71">METHYL FORMATE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-31-3; Chemical Formula: HCOOCH<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1258 </ITAG>OSHA had a limit of 100 ppm TWA for methyl formate. The ACGIH also hasan 8-hour time-weighted average of 100 ppm, with a TLV-STEL of 150 ppm.OSHA proposed to retain the 8-hour TWA of 100 ppm for methyl formate andto add a STEL of 150 ppm; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs that theselimits are appropriate. The final rule retains the 8-hour TWA of 100 ppmand adds a 15-minute STEL of 150 ppm. Methyl formate is a flammable, colorlessliquid with an agreeable odor. Methyl formate causes nose and eye irritation, vomiting, incoordination,narcosis, and death in guinea pigs exposed at high concentrations (Schrenk,Yant, Chornyak, and Patty 1936/Ex. 1-756). A 5-percent concentration wasfatal in 20 to 30 minutes, a 1.5- to 2.5-percent concentration was dangerousin 30 to 60 minutes, and a 0.5-percent concentration (5000 ppm) was consideredthe maximum concentration tolerable for a 60-minute period without seriousconsequences. Lehmann and Flury (1943b/Ex. 1-963) observed that inhalationof 1.02 percent methyl formate for two to three hours caused pulmonaryedema and death in cats; a concentration of 1600 ppm resulted in lung inflammationafter one hour. Guinea pigs died when exposed by inhalation to 2.5 percentmethyl formate (Lehmann and Flury 1943b/Ex. 1-963). In studies of methyl formate exposure in humans, von Oettingen (1959/Ex.1-499) reported that exposed workers showed temporary blindness, narcosis,mucous membrane irritation, and dyspnea. Fairhall (1957c/Ex. 1-1107) hasreported that methyl formate is more irritating than either methyl or ethylacetate. Only NIOSH commented on this substance. In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour PEL of 100 ppm TWA andadding a STEL of 150 ppm to prevent the significant risks of irritation,narcotic effects, and pulmonary damage, which constitute material healthimpairments that are associated with exposure to concentrations of methylformate even for short periods (one hour or more). The basis for this limitis analogy to the toxicity of methyl acetate. The Agency concludes thatthese limits will substantially reduce these significant risks. <ITAG tagnum="71">METHYL IODIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 74-88-4; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>I</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1259 </ITAG>OSHA formerly had a limit of 5 ppm TWA, with a skin notation, for methyliodide. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA limit of 2 ppm, with a skin notation, formethyl iodide, and classifies it as a suspected human carcinogen (A2).NIOSH recommends reducing exposure to the lowest feasible limit, and alsoconsiders this chemical a carcinogen. The proposed PEL was an 8-hour TWAPEL of 2 ppm, with a skin notation; the final rule establishes these limits.Methyl iodide is a colorless, sweet-smelling liquid that turns yellow,red, or brown when exposed to light and moisture. Methyl iodide has been reported to have an LD<T2>50</T2> in rats of 150 to 200 mg/kg; liver damage was evident afterthese lethal exposures (Kutob and Plaa 1962/Ex. 1-61). Fifteen-minute exposuresto 3800 ppm were fatal in rats (Chambers et al. 1950, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 399), and Bachem (1927/Ex. 1-1013) has reported that methyliodide is six times as toxic in mice as methyl bromide. Inhalation studieshave shown eye irritation and depressed body weight in rats as a resultof 14-week exposures to 30 and 60 ppm (Blank, Nair, Roloff, and Ribelin1984/Ex. 1-619). The same authors observed fatalities in rats within fourweeks of exposure to 143 ppm; 10 ppm was reported to be a no-effect level.In industry, fatalities have occurred from methyl iodide poisoning in chemicalworkers (Garland and Camps 1945/Ex. 1-1190; Appel, Galen, O'Brien, andSchoenfeldt 1975/Ex. 1-1076). However, the exposure levels associated withthese fatal overexposures are not known (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 399). In tests of carcinogenicity, methyl iodide produced local sarcomas in ratsinjected subcutaneously and lung tumors in mice given intraperitoneal injections(Druckrey, Kruse, Preussman et al. 1970/Ex. 1-246; Poirier, Stoner, andShimkin 1975/Ex. 1-686). These carcinogenic effects occurred at a dosageapproximately equivalent to a daily 8-hour exposure to 20 or 25 ppm foran adult human (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 399). OSHA received comments onmethyl iodide's health effects from the American Industrial Hygiene Association(AIHA). (Ex. 8-16; Tr. 3-309) and from NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A). TheAIHA stated that ``[a] number of potentially carcinogenic substances forwhich PEL revisions are proposed appear to have been misclassified concerningtheir toxic effect'' (Ex. 8-16, p. 6). The AIHA includes methyl iodidein this group of substances. As discussed in the introduction to SectionVI.C, OSHA did not intend the proposal's classifications to have regulatoryimplications; rather, both this classification and that of the final ruleare intended only to reflect the health endpoint used by the ACGIH or NIOSHas the basis for selecting a particular PEL for a given substance, andto facilitate generic rulemaking. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A) agreed thatthe methyl iodide limit established by OSHA is appropriate, but pointedout that this substance could be classified as an occupational carcinogen.In the final rule, OSHA establishes an 8-hour TWA limit of 2 ppm, witha skin notation, for methyl iodide. The Agency concludes that these limitswill protect workers from the significant risk of irritation and liverand kidney damage, which are material impairments of health that are associatedwith exposure to methyl iodide in the workplace. The skin notation is neededto prevent dermal absorption of toxic amounts of methyl iodide. <ITAG tagnum="71">METHYL ISOAMYL KETONE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 110-12-3; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>COCH(C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>)<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1260 </ITAG>OSHA formerly had no limit for methyl isoamyl ketone (MIAK). The ACGIHhas established an 8-hour TLV-TWA of 50 ppm. NIOSH also recommends a 50-ppmTWA limit for MIAK. The proposed PEL was 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, withwhich NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs. The final rule establishes theselimits. Methyl isoamyl ketone is a colorless, clear liquid with a pleasantodor. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> value of methyl isoamyl ketone in rats is 1.67 g/kg (Smyth,Carpenter, Weil et al. 1962/Ex. 1-441). No data relating exposure levelsto specific effects in humans have been reported. However, the ACGIH (1986/Ex.1-3, p. 400) believes that MIAK is likely to be more irritating and a morepotent narcotic than is the case for methyl isobutyl ketone. The NIOSH criteria document on the ketones (1978f, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 400) states that ``because methyl isoamyl ketone contains one morecarbon atom than does methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl [isoamyl] ketone mightproduce irritation and narcosis at concentrations at least as low as thoseat which methyl isobutyl ketone produces these effects,'' and NIOSH thusrecommends a 50-ppm TWA for MIAK, corresponding to NIOSH's recommendationfor methyl isobutyl ketone (NIOSH 1978f, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 400). NIOSH submitted the only comments on MIAK. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 50 ppm formethyl isoamyl ketone. The Agency concludes that this limit will protectworkers against the significant risk of narcotic and irritant effects,which constitute material health impairments that are associated with exposureto MIAK at levels above the new PEL. <ITAG tagnum="71">METHYL ISOPROPYL KETONE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 563-80-4; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2>CHCOCH<T2>3</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PEL was 200 ppm as an 8-hour TWA;NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs, and the final rule establishes thislimit. Methyl isopropyl ketone is a colorless, flammable liquid. Animal studies have shown MIPK to have an acute toxicity somewhat greaterthan that of diethyl ketone and somewhat less than that of di-n-propylketone or methyl-n-propyl ketone (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 405). Rats exposedfor four hours at a concentration of 5700 ppm died (NIOSH 1977i, Ex. 1-1182).Other data concerning the inhalation toxicity of MIPK are lacking. Dr.Grace Ziem (Ex. 46) noted that respiratory irritation, headaches, and nauseahave been demonstrated to occur in humans at low levels of MIPK exposure.OSHA establishes in the final rule a limit of 200 ppm TWA for methyl isopropylketone. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workers againstthe significant risk of irritation, a material health impairment that isassociated with exposure to this ketone at levels above the new PEL. <ITAG tagnum="71">METHYL PARATHION </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 298-00-0; Chemical Formula: C<T2>8</T2>H<T2>10</T2>NO<T2>5</T2>PS </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1265 </ITAG>OSHA formerly had no limit for methyl parathion. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWAof 0.2 mg/m\3\, with a skin notation. NIOSH also recommends a TWA of 0.2mg/m\3\, and a skin notation for methyl parathion. The proposed PEL wasan 8-hour TWA limit of 0.2 mg/m\3\, with a skin notation; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47,Table N1) concurs with these limits, and they are established in the finalrule. Methyl parathion is a tan to brown liquid with a pungent odor likethat of garlic. Methyl parathion is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and excessive exposurecan cause sweating, salivation, diarrhea, bradycardia, bronchoconstriction,muscle fasciculations, and coma. Methyl parathion's acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> for male rats is almost identical to that of parathion, (i.e.,10 to 25 mg/kg); for female rats, the LD<T2>50</T2> is 24 mg/kg, or approximately one-sixth that of parathion.By the dermal route, methyl parathion is much less toxic than parathion,with an LD<T2>50</T2> of 67 mg/kg in rats of both sexes (Hayes 1963/Ex. 1-982). Erythrocytecholinesterase activity was inhibited in dogs fed methyl parathion for12 weeks at a rate corresponding to approximately 24 mg/day; inhibitionof both plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase activity occurred at dosesof 70 mg/day, without accompanying illness (Williams, Fuyat, and Fitzhugh,1959/Ex. 1-810). Dogs fed 6 mg/day methyl parathion for 12 weeks showedno effects from such exposures (Williams, Fuyat, and Fitzhugh 1959/Ex.1-810). Lifetime feeding studies of rats and mice fed diets containingmethyl parathion concentrations of up to 40 ppm and up to 125 ppm, respectively,produced no evidence of cancer (NCI 1979a/Ex. 1-1116). Plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase levels did not differ by more than20 percent in subjects exposed at 7, 7.5, 8, or 9 mg/man/day, comparedwith controls (Moeller and Rider 1963/Ex. 1-565). Tiess, Wegener, and Tamme(1982/Ex. 1-774) have reported a case of protracted methyl parathion poisoningresulting from both percutaneous and inhalation exposures; Dille and Smith(1964/Ex. 1-549) attribute the long-term neuropsychiatric illness of twopilots to exposure to methyl parathion and other cholinesterase-inhibitingagents. Chronic exposure to small doses of methyl parathion have not causedchromosomal effects (de Cassia Stocco, Becak, Gaeta, and Rabello-Gay 1982/Ex.1-540). No comments other than those from NIOSH were received on methylparathion. In the final rule, OSHA establishes a limit of 0.2 mg/m\3\ TWA for methylparathion, with a skin notation. The Agency concludes that this limit willprotect workers against the significant risk of acetylcholinesterase inhibition,which constitutes a material impairment of health that is associated withworkplace exposures at levels above the new PEL. The skin notation willprotect workers from the significant risk of systemic toxicity associatedwith percutaneous absorption of this substance.<ITAG tagnum="71">METHYLCYCLOHEXANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-87-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>7</T2>H<T2>14</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposedPEL was 400 ppm; NIOSH concurred that this reduction in the TWA was appropriate(Ex. 8-47, Table N1). The final rule reduces the 8-hour TWA for methylcyclohexanefrom 500 ppm to 400 ppm.Lehmann and Flury (1943e, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 384) indicatethat the acute toxicity of methylcyclohexane is greater than that of heptanebut less than that of octane. Lazarew (1929/Ex. 1-1059) found that a two-hourexposure to a concentration of 7500 to 10,000 ppm caused prostration inmice, and exposure to 10,000 to 12,500 ppm caused death. Treon, Crutchfield,and Kitzmiller (1943b/Ex. 1-394) reported that exposure to 1200 ppm hadno effect in rabbits, and prolonged exposures to 370 ppm had no effectin monkeys. Methylcyclohexane's histologic effects in animals resemblethose of cyclohexane; the liver and kidney are the sites affected (ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 384). Only NIOSH commented on methylcyclohexane.OSHA establishes an 8-hour TWA limit of 400 ppm for methylcyclohexane inthe final rule. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workersagainst the significant risk of irritation, a material health impairmentthat is associated with exposure to methylcyclohexane at levels above thenew PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">2-METHYLCYCLOPENTADIENYL MANGANESE TRICARBONYL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 12108-13-3; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)C<T2>5</T2>H<T2>5</T2>-Mn(CO)<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PEL was 0.2 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA,with a skin notation; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs. This limit, measuredas manganese, is established in the final rule, along with a skin notation.Cl-2 is a dark orange liquid with a faintly pleasant odor; it is a complexorganic compound containing about 25 percent manganese by weight.2-Methylcyclopentadienyl Mn tricarbonyl is highly toxic in its concentratedform, causing adverse effects primarily on the central nervous system.It is somewhat irritating to the eyes but skin contact does not produceirritation or sensitization; however, Cl-2 is readily absorbed throughthe skin (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 387). Animal studies indicate that Cl-2has a toxicity similar to that of tetraethyl lead and is highly toxic byall routes of exposure (U.S. Navy Smoke Abatement Additive, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 387).The single-dose oral LD<T2>50 </T2>for rats is 23 or 39 mg/kg, depending on sex. The skin LD<T2>50 </T2>for rabbits is 1692 andplusmin; 145 mg/kg, and the 1-hour inhalationLC<T2>50 </T2>for rats is about 350 mg/m\3\ (The Ethyl Corporation, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 387). Toxic exposures by all routes produce rapidlyappearing symptoms of mild excitement, hyperactivity, tremors, severe clonicspasms, weakness, respiratory distress, and occasional clonic convulsions,followed by terminal coma (U.S. Navy Smoke Abatement Additive, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 387).Acute exposure causes damage to the liver, kidneys, and cerebral cortex,as well as changes in lung tissue (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 387). Browning(1966/Ex. 1-1018) observed chronic bronchitis, peribronchitis, interstitialpneumonia, and lung abscesses in animals that subsequently died from long-terminhalation exposure to Cl-2; exposure to Cl-2 concentrations of approximately12 mg/m\3\ for 100 days produced no deviation in weight gain patterns andno gross or microscopic changes in two dogs (Browning 1966/Ex. 1-1018).The liver and kidneys are the principal target organs associated with acuteoverexposures; the lungs of overexposed animals were hemorrhagic (Browning1966/Ex. 1-1018).In humans, skin contact should be entirely avoided. A 5- to 15-ml spillon one worker's hand and wrist was reported to have caused ``thick tongue,''nausea, giddiness, and headache within 3 to 5 minutes (U.S. Navy SmokeAbatement Additive, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 387). NIOSH submittedthe only comment on this substance.In the final rule, OSHA establishes a PEL of 0.2 mg/m\3\ TWA, measuredas manganese, with a skin notation, for 2-methylcyclopentadienyl manganesetricarbonyl. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workersagainst the significant risk of CNS effects and systemic damage, whichconstitute material health impairments and are associated with exposureto Cl-2 at levels higher than the new PEL. A skin notation is establishedbecause of Cl-2's demonstrated ability to penetrate human skin rapidlyand to cause systemic effects.<ITAG tagnum="71">MONOCROTOPHOS (AZODRIN)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 6923-22-4; Chemical Formula: C<T2>7</T2>H<T2>14</T2>NO<T2>5</T2>P</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1279</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no limit for the systemic insecticide monocrotophos.The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 0.25 mg/m3 for this reddish-brown solid witha mild ester odor. The proposed PEL was 0.25 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA; NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs with this limit, which is established in thefinal rule.Monocrotophos is a highly toxic, direct acting cholinesterase inhibitorthat penetrates the intact skin (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 416). The acuteoral LD<T2>50</T2> values in rats and mice range from 5.7 to 17 mg/kg in a waterformulation (Brown et al. 1970, Shellenberger and Newell, both as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 416) and from 10 to 23 mg/kg in an oil formulation(Shellenberger and Newell, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 416). Theseauthors also report a percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> in the rabbit that ranges from 112 to 709 mg/kg, dependingon the vehicle used. A two-year dietary study of rats ingesting 0, 1, 10,or 100 ppm monocrotophos revealed that both sexes in the 100 ppm groupfailed to gain as much weight as the controls, but autopsy showed no significantfindings; plasma, erythrocyte, and brain cholinesterase decreased at thetwo highest dose levels but were unaffected at 1 ppm (Johnston 1966-67,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 416). Another two-year feeding studyin dogs administered doses of up to 16 ppm monocrotophos revealed no adverseeffects at levels of 0.16 and 1.6 ppm, but serious cholinesterase reductionwas observed at the 16-ppm level (Johnston 1966-67, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 416). Metabolism studies in rats and goats indicate that monocrotophosis excreted rapidly in the rat and does not accumulate in the body (Bulland Lindquist 1966/Ex. 1-719; goats given labeled monocrotophos by mouthshowed only traces of the material in their milk (Menzer and Casida 1965/Ex.1-986; Potter, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 416). Inhalation exposureof rats to an unknown concentration of 75 percent monocrotophos in airfor one hour was not lethal; a four-hour exposure to an unknown concentrationof the aerosol (0.4 and 0.75 percent) was fatal to two out of six (0.4percent aerosol) and five out of eight rats (0.75 percent aerosol). Head-onlyexposure to the 0.4-percent aerosol resulted in the death of one of eightanimals (Wilson, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 416).Intravenous injection of radiolabeled monocrotophos in human volunteersshowed maximum excretion at 4 to 8 hours, with 67andplusmin;5 percent ofthe material in the urine; absorption of 14 andplusmin;7 percent occurredwhen the radiolabeled material was applied to the forearm; 33 andplusmin;9percent of the applied dose was absorbed when it was covered with a vapor-prooffilm for 72 hours (Maibach 1970, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 416).Although gauze patches attached to the clothing and skin of field workersattested to the presence of monocrotophos, no cholinesterase inhibitionwas observed in post-exposure examinations at three hours and at threeand seven days (Maibach, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 416). OnlyNIOSH commented on this substance.OSHA is establishing a PEL of 0.25 mg/m3 (8-hour TWA) for monocrotophosin the final rule. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workersagainst the significant risk of cholinesterase inhibition, a material impairmentof health that is associated with exposure to this substance in the workplaceat levels above the new PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">MORPHOLINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 110-91-8; Chemical Formula: C<T2>4</T2>H<T2>9</T2>NO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1281</ITAG>OSHA had a limit of 20 ppm, with a skin notation, for morpholine. The ACGIHhas a 20-ppm TWA limit and a TLV-STEL of 30 ppm, as well as a skin notation.The proposal retained the 8-hour TWA PEL of 20 ppm and added a STEL of30 ppm; NIOSH concurs that these limits are appropriate (Ex. 8-47, TableN1), and they are established in the final rule. The skin notation is retained.Morpholine is a colorless liquid with an amine-like odor.Exposure to morpholine produces nasal and bronchial irritation and liverand kidney impairment in animals (Shea 1939/Ex. 1-758); the substance readilypenetrates the skin and is highly irritating to the eyes (Jefferson ChemicalCompany, Inc. 1961, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 417). The singleoral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is 1.05 g/kg (range: 0.95 to 1.16 g/kg), and the singleskin LD<T2>50</T2> for 24-hour contact is 0.5 ml/kg (Smyth, Carpenter, Weil, andPozzani 1954/Ex. 1-440). Neither a one-hour exposure to concentrated vapornor an 8-hour exposure to 8000 ppm was fatal in rats (Smyth, Carpenter,Weil, and Pozzani 1954/Ex. 1-440). Rats were exposed for eight hours dailyto a concentration of 18,000 ppm for a total of five days; after the firstday, all animals showed severely reddened thoracic walls, and one fatality(from kidney and liver congestion) occurred. A similar fatality occurredon the third day; on day 4, a third rat died, and postmortem examinationrevealed degeneration of the epithelial lining of the kidney tubules. Threeadditional deaths occurred after the exposures had ended; autopsy revealedthickened alveoli, emphysema, and liver and kidney effects (Shea 1939/Ex.1-758).Reporting on his own reactions to morpholine exposure at a concentrationof 12,000 ppm, Shea (1939/Ex. 1-758) complained of nose irritation (after1 minute) and coughing (after 90 seconds); in addition, when he transferredmorpholine by pipette, he experienced sore throat and mucosal irritation.All symptoms disappeared after the experiment stopped (Shea 1939/Ex. 1-758).Skin contact poses a moderately high degree of hazard, which diminishesas the product is diluted with water to less than 25 percent (JeffersonChemical Company, Inc. 1961, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 417). Respiratoryirritation but no chronic effects have been reported as a result of industrialexposure (Patty 1963e/Ex. 1-858). In comparison with ammonia, morpholinehas a greater potential for systemic toxicity (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 417).OSHA received a comment on morpholine from Lawrence Hecker of Abbott Laboratories(Ex. 3-678). Dr. Hecker states (Ex. 3-678, p. 8) that the STEL proposedfor morpholine should not be included in the final rule because the healthevidence for this substance does not warrant a STEL. OSHA does not agreewith Dr. Hecker; there is evidence in the record that morpholine's effectsare experienced even at elevated exposures lasting only one minute (Shea1939/Ex. 1-758). Because morpholine has a greater potential for systemiceffects than does ammonia, a STEL is needed to ensure that short-term excursionssubstantially above the 8-hour TWA PEL do not occur.In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA limit for morpholineof 20 ppm TWA and the skin notation, and is adding a 15-minute STEL of30 ppm. The Agency concludes that these limits will work together to protectworkers against the significant risk of eye and respiratory tract irritation,which are material impairments of health that are associated with exposuresat levels above the 8-hour TWA limit. OSHA is retaining the skin notationfor morpholine because of this substance's ability to be absorbed throughthe skin in toxic amounts.<ITAG tagnum="71">NITRIC ACID</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7697-37-2; Chemical Formula: HNO<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1286</ITAG>OSHA had an 8-hour TWA limit of 2 ppm for nitric acid. The ACGIH has thesame TWA limit and a 15-minute STEL of 4 ppm, and NIOSH recommends a TWAlimit of 2 ppm. The proposal retained the 8-hour TWA PEL of 2 ppm for nitricacid and added a STEL of 4 ppm; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred withthese limits, which are established in the final rule. Nitric acid is afuming colorless or yellowish liquid.Rats receiving a single exposure to nitric acid mist at a concentrationof 63 mg/m3 exhibited no apparent adverse effects (Diggle and Gage 1954/Ex.1-729). Chronic exposure to airborne nitric acid vapor or mist at unspecifiedlevels was reported to cause chronic bronchitis, pneumonitis (Fairhall1957i, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 428), and tooth erosion (Lynchand Bell 1947/Ex. 1-793). Nitric acid's irritant potential is consideredsimilar to that of other strong acids; it typically exists in conjunctionwith nitrogen dioxide, which is regarded as being more hazardous (ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 428). No comments, other than NIOSH's, were submittedon this substance.OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA PEL of 2 ppm and adding a STEL of 4 ppmfor nitric acid in the final rule.

OSHA proposed to reduce the former 8-hour TWA of 1 ppm (equivalentto 6 mg/m3) to 3 mg/m3, and to retain the skin notation. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47,Table N1) concurred that these limits were appropriate, and they are establishedin the final rule. para-Nitroaniline usually exists in the form of yellowneedles.p-Nitroaniline is readily absorbed through the skin and is a strong methemoglobin-formingagent; prolonged exposure can cause liver damage (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.430). Anderson (1946/Ex. 1-1049) reported several cases of PNA-poisoningamong shipboard workers assigned to clean up a p-nitroaniline spill; oneman with a history of liver disease became jaundiced and died, and theother exposed workers became cyanotic and complained of headache, sleepiness,weakness, and respiratory distress (Anderson 1946/Ex. 1-1049). It has alsobeen reported that children who ingested p-nitroaniline that was containedin wax crayons subsequently became ill (Rieders and Brieger 1953/Ex. 1-798).Several investigators (Anderson 1946/Ex. 1-1049; Gupta 1953, Fairhall 1957j,both as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 430; Linch 1974/Ex. 1-747) haveconcluded that the nitroanilines are more hazardous than aniline, and,on this basis, the ACGIH has recommended a TWA Limit for PNA that is lowerthan the limit for aniline (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 430). Only NIOSH submittedcomments on p-nitroaniline.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a PEL of 3 mg/m3 (8-hour TWA) forp-nitroaniline and is retaining the skin notation. The Agency concludesthat this limit will protect workers against the significant risk of methemoglobinemiaand liver damage, both of which constitute material health impairmentsthat are associated with exposure to PNA at levels above 3 mg/m3. The Agencyis retaining the skin notation because this substance is readily absorbedthrough the skin in toxic amounts.<ITAG tagnum="71">NITROTOLUENE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 88-72-2 (o-isomer); 99-08-1 (m-isomer); 99-99-0 (p-isomer);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>NO<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The final rule establishesan 8-hour TWA PEL for nitrotoluene of 2 ppm and retains the skin notation.The ortho- and meta-isomers of nitrotoluene are yellow liquids; the para-isomeris also yellow, but exists in crystalline form.Nitrotoluene is one of the aromatic nitrogen compounds that may cause methemoglobinformation. Linch (1974/Ex. 1-747) has studied the nitrotoluene isomersand reported that they have relatively low emiagenic potential; he considerednitrotoluene comparable to aniline in its toxic effects (Linch 1974/Ex.1-747). Cases of poisoning as a result of exposure to nitrotoluene arerare (von Oettingen 1941/Ex. 1-874). Only NIOSH commented on this substance.In the final rule, OSHA establishes an 8-hour TWA limit of 2 ppm and retainsthe skin notation for nitrotoluene. The Agency concludes that this limitwill protect workers against the significant risk of methemoglobinemia,a material health impairment that is associated with exposure to this substance;the skin notation is retained because of nitrotoluene's capacity to penetratethe skin.<ITAG tagnum="71">NONANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 111-84-2; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>(CH<T2>2</T2>)<T2>7</T2>CH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PEL was 200 ppm; NIOSH concursthat this limit is appropriate (Ex. 8-47, Table N1). The final rule promulgatesan 8-hour TWA PEL for nonane of 200 ppm.The toxicity of nonane is approximately equal to that of VMandamp;P naphtha.Naphtha has a 4-hour inhalation LC<T2>50</T2> for rats of 3400 ppm, while nonane has an LC<T2>50</T2> of 3200 ppm (Carpenter, Kinkead, Geary et al. 1975a/Ex. 1-302;Carpenter, Geary, Myers et al. 1978/Ex. 1-301). These investigators founda no-effect level of 590 ppm nonane for rats exposed six hours/day, fivedays/week for a 65-day period; under the same exposure conditions, a no-effectlevel of 560 ppm was reported for rats exposed to VMandamp;P naphtha (Carpenter,Kinkead, Geary et al. 1975a/Ex. 1-302; Carpenter, Geary, Myers et al. 1978/Ex.1-301). Earlier studies of octane and heptane have resulted in much higherLC<T2>50</T2> values for mice, i.e., 13,500 ppm and 16,000 ppm, respectively,for 30- to 60-minute exposures (Flury and Zernik 1931j/Ex. 1-994). Swannand associates (1974/Ex. 1-124) have reported similarly high LD<T2>50</T2> values in mice for octane and hexane; mice died from respiratoryarrest after 3 to 5 minutes of exposure to 16,000 ppm of octane or to 48,000ppm of hexane (Swann, Kwon, and Hogan 1974/Ex. 1-124). The AFL-CIO (Ex.194) and the United Auto Workers (Ex. 197) favor a 10 ppm PEL for all petroleumsolvents and urge OSHA to consider a lower PEL.In the final rule, OSHA establishes an 8-hour TWA limit of 200 ppm fornonane. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workers againstthe significant risk of narcosis, a material impairment of health thatis associated with exposure to nonane at levels above the new PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">OXALIC ACID</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 144-62-7; Chemical Formula: H<T2>2</T2>C<T2>2</T2>O<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The final rule retains the 8-hourTWA PEL of 1 mg/m\3\ for oxalic acid and adds a STEL of 2 mg/m\3\. Anhydrousoxalic acid usually occurs in the form of a white powder; the dihydrateform is a colorless, odorless, crystalline substance.Oxalic acid is known to produce severe burns of the eyes, mucous membranes,and skin (Windholz 1983d/Ex. 1-835, p. 991). There have been human fatalitiesfrom ingesting as little as 5 grams of oxalic acid. It appears that thesedeaths were caused by oxalic acid's ability to disturb the calcium-potassiumbalance in critical tissues (Klauder, Shelanski, and Gabriel 1955/Ex. 1-1057).Solutions of 5- to 10-percent oxalic acid have also been reported to irritatethe skin on prolonged exposure. NIOSH was the only commenter on oxalicacid.Because of oxalic acid's severe acute toxicity, OSHA is retaining the 8-hourTWA limit of 1 mg/m\3\ PEL and adding a STEL of 2 mg/m\3\ in the finalrule. The Agency concludes that both of these limits are required to protectexposed workers from the significant risk of severe eye and skin burnsand respiratory tract irritation, which are material health impairmentsassociated with elevated short-term exposures at levels above the TWA limit.<ITAG tagnum="71">PERCHLORYL FLUORIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7616-94-6; Chemical Formula: C10<T2>3</T2>F</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposal retained the 8-hour TWA PEL of 3 ppm for perchlorylfluoride and added a STEL of 6 ppm. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concursthat these limits are appropriate and they are established in the finalrule.The 4-hour LC<T2>50</T2>s in rats and mice were 385 and 630 ppm, respectively. Dogsexposed for 4 hours to 220- to 450-ppm concentrations of the vapor, followedby exposure to 620 ppm for 2.5 hours, became hyperneic and cyanotic andshowed increased methemoglobin. Dogs succumbing to these exposures hadpigment deposition in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow; alveolar hemorrhageand collapse; and emphysema (Greene, Colbourn, Donati, and Weeks 1960,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 466).Exposure to 185 ppm for six hours/day, five days/week for seven weeks killed18 of 20 rats, 20 of 39 mice, and all exposed guinea pigs (Greene, Colbourn,Donati, and Weeks 1960, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 466). Theseanimals had difficulty breathing, became cyanotic, and developed alveolaredema and methemoglobinemia; at autopsy, they showed fluorosis, patchylungs, enlarged spleens, and hemosiderosis of the kidneys, spleen, andliver. When animals were exposed on a similar regimen but to a concentrationof 104 ppm for six weeks, all guinea pigs but only 1 of 20 rats died (Greene,Colbourn, Donati, and Weeks 1960, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 466).After a six-month exposure to 24 ppm, bone fluoride levels increased fourfoldin guinea pigs, threefold in rats, and about 50 percent in dogs. Animalsexposed at 24 ppm showed no signs of irritation (Greene, Colbourn, Donati,and Weeks 1960, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 466). Only NIOSH commentedon perchloryl fluoride.In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA of 3 ppm and addinga STEL of 6 ppm for perchloryl fluoride. These limits are based on thefluoride content of this compound.

The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 0.01 ppm (0.1 mg/m3)and a TLV-STEL of 0.03 ppm (0.3 mg/m3), also with a skin notation. Theproposal retained the 8-hour TWA of 0.1 mg/m3 and added a STEL of 0.3 mg/m3;the skin notation was retained. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred withthese limits, which are established in the final rule. Phosdrin is a colorlessliquid. The commercial product is a mixture of cis- and trans-isomers thathave a yellow color. The acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> of phosdrin is 4 to 8 mg/kg for male mice and 6 to 8 mg/kgfor female rats (Shell Chemical Corporation 1956, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 412). Phosdrin is a cholinesterase inhibitor and has been reportedto cause slight plasma cholinesterase depression but no decrease in braincholinesterase activity in rats fed 2 to 5 ppm. The compound may be absorbeddermally and by inhalation or ingestion; the action of the compound isdirect and immediate (Cleveland and Treon 1961/Ex. 1-476). The dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rats has been reported to be 4.5 mg/kg (Gaines 1969/Ex.1-320). Chronic feeding of rats demonstrated a minimal lethal dose of between100 and 200 ppm. Cholinesterase activity decreased continually when sublethaldoses were administered until a maximum reduction in RBC cholinesteraseactivity of 25 percent was achieved on the 27th day of the administrationof 1.5 to 20 mg doses (Huelse and Federspil 1975/Ex. 1-959). In industry, the primary hazards associated with exposure to phosdrin areabsorption of phosdrin through the skin, lung, and mucous membranes, whichcauses liver damage (Natoff 1970/Ex. 1-966). Phosdrin intoxication is reportedto occur in human, with accompanying symptoms of headache, visual distortion,weakness, cramps, diarrhea, pain, and respiratory distress. Severe exposuremay cause convulsions; in one reported case, some symptoms (anxiety, depression,vertigo, and nystagmus) persisted for as long as four months (Zavon, ascited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 412). Only NIOSH commented on this substance.In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.1 mg/m3 andadding a STEL of 0.3 mg/m3 for phosdrin; the skin notation is retained.These limits are based on analogy to the toxicity of parathion. The Agencyconcludes that these limits will protect workers against the significantrisk of cholinesterase inhibition and hepatic injury, which constitutematerial health impairments that result from the absorption of phosdrinthrough the skin and mucous membranes and from exposure by the inhalationand oral routes. OSHA finds that these limits will substantially reducethese significant risks. <ITAG tagnum="71">PHOSPHORUS OXYCHLORIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 10025-87-3; Chemical Formula: POCl<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1323</ITAG>OSHA had no former limit for phosphorus oxychloride. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWAof 0.1 ppm and a TLV-STEL of 0.5 ppm for this clear, colorless, fumingliquid, which has a pungent odor. The proposed PELs were 0.1 ppm as an8-hour TWA and 0.5 ppm as a 15-minute STEL. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1)concurred with these limits. The final rule establishes an 8-hour TWA of0.1 ppm for this substance but, for the reasons discussed below, does notinclude a STEL for phosphorus oxychloride. The primary hazards associated with inhalation of phosphorus oxychloridevapor are irritation of the eyes and respiratory tract, as well as narcoticeffects, gastric irritation, pulmonary edema, and nephritis (InternationalTechnical Information Institute 1978/Ex. 1-837). Weeks and associates (1964, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 485) reported4-hour LC<T2>50</T2> values for phosphorus oxychloride of 48 ppm and 52 ppm forrats and guinea pigs, respectively. They also observed that ammonia vapormediates the irritant effects of exposure to phosphorus oxychloride withoutsignificantly altering this LC<T2>50</T2> value (Weeks, Downing, Musselman et al. 1964, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 485).Both chronic and acute occupational intoxication have been reported tooccur among workers exposed to phosphorus oxychloride (Sassi 1954/Ex. 1-931).The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) recommended that OSHAdelete the STEL for phosphorus oxychloride (Tr. 3-307, Ex. 8-16) on thegrounds that the ACGIH intends to delete this STEL. After a review of theavailable evidence for this substance, OSHA is not including a STEL forphosphorus oxychloride in the final rule. The Agency's reasoning on thisissue is discussed in Section VI.C.17 of this preamble. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a PEL of 0.1 ppm (8-hour TWA) forphosphorus oxychloride, by analogy to the toxicity of phosphorus trichloride.The Agency concludes that this limit will reduce the significant risk ofnarcosis and systemic poisoning, which are material health impairmentsthat are associated with acute and chronic exposure at levels above thenew PEL. <ITAG tagnum="71">PHOSPHORUS PENTASULFIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1314-80-3; Chemical Formula: P<T2>2</T2>S<T2>5</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposal retained the 8-hour TWA PEL of 1 mg/m3 and addeda STEL of 3 mg/m3; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs with these limits.The final rule retains the 8-hour TWA PEL of 1 mg/m3 for phosphorus pentasulfideand adds a STEL of 3 mg/m3. Phosphorus pentasulfide is a greenish-yellowcrystalline mass with an odor like that of rotten eggs. The primary hazard associated with exposure to phosphorus pentasulfideis respiratory irritation (Smyth 1956/Ex. 1-759). In the presence of moisture,phosphorus pentasulfide is rapidly hydrolyzed to phosphoric acid and hydrogensulfide. The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 485) considers phosphorus pentasulfideto be as toxic as phosphoric acid. Only NIOSH commented on this substance.In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA PEL of 1 mg/m3 andadding a 15-minute STEL of 3 mg/m3 for phosphorus pentasulfide. The Agencyconcludes that both of these limits are necessary to reduce the significantrisk of respiratory irritation, a material health impairment that is associatedwith exposure to this substance at the higher concentrations permittedin the past by the TWA alone. <ITAG tagnum="71">PHTHALIC ANHYDRIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 85-44-9; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>(CO)<T2>2</T2>O</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1326</ITAG>OSHA had an 8-hour TWA limit of 2 ppm for phthalic anhydride. The ACGIHhas a limit of 1 ppm TWA for phthalic anhydride, which exists in the formof white crystalline needles with a mild odor. The proposed PEL was 1 ppmas an 8-hour TWA, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs that this limitis appropriate. The final rule establishes an 8-hour TWA PEL of 1 ppm forphthalic anhydride. The primary exposure hazards associated with phthalic anhydride are severeskin, eye, and respiratory irritation. The substance can also produce skinand, perhaps, pulmonary sensitization (Patty 1963i, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 487). Baader (1955/Ex. 1-1139) has reported irritant effects inanimals exposed to 30 mg/m3 (approximately 5 ppm) phthalic anhydride inair. In studies of workers exposed to phthalic anhydride, symptoms of respiratorytract injury as well as bronchitis, eye irritation, and nasal bleedinghave been reported. Precise exposure concentrations were not detectableby the analytic method being used, which had a limit of detection of 25mg/m3 (i.e., of 4 ppm or lower) (Baader 1955/Ex. 1-1139; Menschick 1955/Ex.1-1091). Other industrial acid anhydrides (e.g., tetrachlorphthalic anhydrideand maleic anhydride) are considered more irritating than phthalic anhydride(ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 489). Only NIOSH commented on this substance. OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 1 ppm for phthalic anhydridein the final rule. The Agency concludes that this 1-ppm limit will reducethe significant risk of respiratory irritation and skin and pulmonary sensitization,all of which constitute material impairments of health that are associatedwith exposure to levels above the new PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">PROPARGYL ALCOHOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 107-19-7; Chemical Formula: HC=CCH<T2>2</T2>OH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1335</ITAG>Previously, OSHA had no limit for propargyl alcohol. The ACGIH has establishedan 8-hour TWA of 1 ppm, with a skin notation, for this straw-colored liquid,which smells like geraniums. The proposed PEL was an 8-hour TWA of 1 ppm,with a skin notation. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs with this limit,which is established in the final rule.In rats, guinea pigs, and mice, the oral LD<T2>50</T2>s are 70, 60, and 50 mg/kg, respectively; the 2-hour inhalationLC<T2>50</T2> in both the rat and mouse is reported to be about 850 ppm (NIOSH1977i/Ex. 1-1182). The dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 88 mg/kg (RTECS).Propargyl alcohol is a primary skin irritant, but it is not a skin sensitizer(Antara Chemicals 1952, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 496). The toxicityof propargyl alcohol is estimated to be equal to that of allyl alcohol(oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats of 64 mg/kg) (NIOSH 1977i/Ex. 1182). The ACGIH limitis based on the structural and toxicological similarity of propargyl alcoholto allyl alcohol (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 496). Grace Ziem, an occupationalphysician, commented (Ex. 46) that the ACGIH <T3>Documentation </T3>(1986/Ex. 1-3) for propargyl alcohol neglects tomention this substance's ability to cause ``degenerative changes in liverand kidneys in [an] 89-day rat study'' that is cited by Rowe and McCollister(1982) in (<T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology</T3> 1982, Vol. 2C, p. 4673)and also overlooks the fact that propargyl alcohol is a ``moderate CNSdepressant.'' OSHA agrees with Dr. Ziem that this substance has these effectswhich, in OSHA's opinion, point to the need for the limits being establishedin this final rule.OSHA is establishing in the final rule an 8-hour TWA for propargyl alcoholof 1 ppm, with a skin notation. The Agency concludes that these limitswill protect workers against the significant risk of skin and mucous membraneirritation, CNS depression, and liver and kidney damage, all of which constitutematerial impairments of health that are associated with exposure to thissubstance at levels above the new limit.<ITAG tagnum="71">PROPIONIC ACID</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 79-09-4; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>COOH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1336</ITAG>OSHA previously had no limit for propionic acid. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWAof 10 ppm for this substance; the TLV was set on the basis of analogy withacetic acid (10 ppm 8-hour TLV). The proposed PELs were 10 ppm as an 8-hourTWA and 15 ppm as a 15-minute STEL. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurredthat these limits are appropriate, and the final rule establishes an 8-hourTWA of 10 ppm but does not include a STEL. Propionic acid is a colorless,oily liquid with a pungent odor.The primary health effects associated with exposure to propionic acid areskin burns and irritation of the eyes and respiratory system. Smyth, Carpenter,Weil, and co-workers (1962/Ex. 1-441) reported that the oral LD<T2>50</T2> for rats is 4.3 g/kg; NIOSH (1977i/Ex. 1-1182) stated thatthe intravenous LD<T2>50</T2> for mice is 625 mg/kg and the skin absorption LD<T2>50</T2> for rabbits is 500 mg/kg. Inhalation of the saturated vaporfor eight hours caused no fatalities in rats (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 498).Acute industrial exposures to propionic acid have been reported to causemild to moderate skin burns, eye irritation, and, in a single incident,asthmatic cough. No irritation was observed as a consequence of exposuresin humans averaging below 0.25 ppm with excursions to 2.1 ppm in an eight-hourperiod (Dow Chemical Company 1977o, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.498).Two commenters in addition to NIOSH commented on propionic acid. The AmericanIndustrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) (Tr. 3-307) urged OSHA to deletethe STEL for propionic acid on the ground that the ACGIH has put the STELfor this substance on its List of Intended Changed (ACGIH 1988). Kodak(Ex. 661) agrees with the AIHA on the issue of a STEL, noting that, inKodak's opinion, the 15-ppm STEL ``cannot be justified on either availabletoxicological data or . . . \1/2\Kodak's\3/4\ own experience.'' After areview of the evidence for propionic acid's short-term effects, OSHA hasdetermined, in accordance with the STEL policy outlined in Section VI.C.17of this preamble, that no STEL is necessary for propionic acid. Accordingly,the final rule contains no short-term limit for this substance.In the final rule, OSHA establishes an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 ppm (8-hourTWA) for propionic acid. The Agency concludes that this limit is requiredto protect workers against the significant risk of eye and respiratorytract irritation, which are material impairments of health that are associatedwith exposure to levels above the new PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">n-PROPYL ACETATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 109-60-4; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>COOCH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1338</ITAG>OSHA previously had an 8-hour TWA limit of 200 ppm for n-propyl acetate.The ACGIH also had a 200-ppm TWA limit but adds a TLV-STEL of 250 ppm.The proposal retained the 8-hour TWA PEL of 200 ppm for n-propyl acetateand added a 15-minute STEL of 250 ppm. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concursthat these limits are appropriate, and they are established by the finalrule. n-Propyl acetate is a pleasant-smelling liquid.The primary health effects associated with exposure to n-propyl acetateare narcosis and eye and respiratory irritation. The five-hour narcoticconcentrations for cats and mice have been reported as 9000 ppm and 6000ppm, respectively (Flury and Wirth 1933, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 500). n-Propyl acetate's narcotic action is 1.3 times that of ethylacetate; salivation and irritation of cats' eyes occurred at 2600 ppm (Fluryand Wirth 1933, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 500). A four-hour exposureat 8000 ppm killed four of six rats (Smyth 1964, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 500). Only NIOSH commented on n-propyl acetate.n-Propyl acetate appears to be more toxic than isopropyl acetate or ethylacetate but less so than n-butyl acetate (ACGIH 1986, p. 500).In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA PEL of 200 ppm forn-propyl acetate and adding a STEL of 250 ppm. The Agency concludes thatboth of these limits are required to prevent the significant risk of narcosisand eye and respiratory tract irritation, which are material impairmentsof health that are associated with exposures to levels above the 8-hourTWA limit alone.<ITAG tagnum="71">PROPYL ALCOHOL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 71-23-8; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>CH<T2>2</T2>OH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1339</ITAG>OSHA had a limit of 200 ppm (8-hour TWA) for n-propyl alcohol. The ACGIHhas the same TWA limit but adds a 250-ppm 15-minute STEL and a skin notation.The proposal retained the 200-ppm 8-hour TWA PEL and added a 15-minuteSTEL of 250 ppm and a skin notation. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concursthat these limits are appropriate, and they are established in the finalrule. The skin notation, however, is not retained (see the discussion ofskin notations in Section VI.C.18 of this preamble). Propyl alcohol isa colorless liquid with an alcohol-like odor.The primary health effect associated with exposure to propyl alcohol ismild narcosis. Propyl alcohol's toxicity is somewhat greater than thatof isopropyl alcohol (Gleason, Gosselin, and Hodge 1963/Ex. 1-1034).The inhalation LD<T2>50</T2> for propyl alcohol in rats is reported as 1.9 g/kg (Smyth,Carpenter, Weil, and Pozzani 1954/Ex. 1-440). Starrek reported deep narcosisin mice inhaling the vapor at a concentration of 4100 ppm for 240 minutesand of 24,500 ppm for 60 minutes; ataxia appeared in 90 to 120 minutesat 3250 ppm (Starrek 1938/Ex. 1-872). These effects are almost twice asintense as those reported for exposure to the vapor of isopropyl alcohol.The dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 5040 mg/kg (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>6th ed., Sax, 1984).Nelson, Enge, Ross, and associates (1943/Ex. 1-66) reported mild eye, nose,and throat irritation in humans exposed at 400 ppm to the vapor of isopropylalcohol, but no data exist on human sensory response to propyl alcoholvapor. The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 500) reports that many industrial hygienistsconsider the vapor of propyl alcohol to be more irritating to the throatthan the vapor of the isomer.One comment, other than NIOSH's, was received on isopropyl alcohol. TheMotor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (Ex. 3-902) asked that rulemakingfor propyl alcohol be delayed, but did not provide any evidence in supportof its position.In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA PEL of 200 ppm andadding a STEL of 250 ppm for propyl alcohol; the skin notation is not includedin the final rule because the LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 5040 mg/kg, well above the level determined byOSHA to require a skin notation (see Section VI.C.18 for a discussion ofskin notations). The Agency concludes that these limits will protect workersagainst the significant risk of narcosis and irritation, both materialimpairments of health.<ITAG tagnum="71">PROPYLENE OXIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-56-9; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CHOCH<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1344</ITAG>Previously, OSHA had an 8-hour TWA limit of 100 ppm for propylene oxide.The ACGIH has a limit of 20 ppm TLV-TWA. The proposed PEL was an 8-hourTWA of 20 ppm, and the final rule establishes this revised limit. Propyleneoxide is a colorless, highly flammable, volatile, and ethereal liquid.The health hazards associated with exposure to this substance are primary,skin, eye, and respiratory irritation, as well as central nervous systemdepression. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> values reported for rats and guinea pigs are 930 mg/kg and690 mg/kg, respectively. In mice, the inhalation LC<T2>50</T2> has been reported to be at 1740 ppm for 4 hours. Dogs and guineapigs exposed for 4 hours at 2000 and 4000 ppm, respectively, died (NIOSH1977i/Ex. 1-1182). Although only some species tolerate daily exposuresto 200 ppm, all species tested tolerated 100 ppm without ill effects (Rowe,Hollingsworth, Oyen et al. 1956/Ex. 1-609). Jacobson and associates (1956/Ex.1-702) considered the toxic effects of propylene oxide to be one-half toone-third as intense as those of ethylene oxide (Jacobson, Hackley, andFeinsilver 1956/Ex. 1-702).Corneal burns and skin necrosis, as well as respiratory and pulmonary irritation,have been reported in humans as a result of direct contact with the liquidor vapor (Patty 1963h/Ex. 1-857); central nervous system effects includeataxia, incoordination, and general depression. OSHA received several comments on propylene oxide. Lawrence Birkner, Managerof Safety and Industrial Hygiene for ARCO Petroleum and Chemical Company(Tr. 3-229/3-245), reported that his company has an internal limit forpropylene oxide of 20 ppm and that about ``98 or 99 percent of . . . [ARCO's]exposures are [presently] below the current ACGIH TLVs'' (Tr. 3-243). Richard E. Sanderson, Director of the Office of Federal Activities forthe EPA, commented that the discussion of propylene oxide's health effectsin the proposal neglected to mention this substance's carcinogenicity orits ability to cause adverse reproductive effects (Ex. 3-746). NIOSH (Ex.8-47, Table N6B) agrees with EPA that propylene oxide is a potential occupationalcarcinogen that warrants a full Section 6(b) rulemaking. NIOSH bases itsinclusion on an NTP bioassay in rats and mice that demonstrates ``someevidence'' of carcinogenicity in rats and ``clear evidence'' of carcinogenicityin mice (Ex. 8-47). In response to these commenters, OSHA states that theAgency is aware of propylene oxide's serious health effects and is monitoringthe literature on this substance closely. OSHA establishes an 8-hour TWA limit of 20 ppm for propylene oxide in thefinal rule to protect workers against the significant risk of primary irritationand CNS depression, which constitute material health impairments that areassociated with exposure to propylene oxide at levels above the revisedPEL. The Agency concludes that this limit will substantially reduce thesesignificant risks. <ITAG tagnum="71">SILICON TETRAHYDRIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7803-62-5; Chemical Formula: SiH<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1361</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no limit for silicon tetrahydride. The ACGIH limit of5 ppm as an 8-hour TWA was established in 1983. The proposed PEL was 5ppm as an 8-hour TWA, a limit with which NIOSH concurs (Ex. 8-47, TableN1). The final rule establishes an 8-hour PEL for silicon tetrahydrideof 5 ppm. Silicon tetrahydride, a colorless gas, is used in the manufactureof semiconductors. Studies of rats exposed to silicon tetrahydride at levels of 126 ppm forone hour (Matheson Gas Products 1971, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.528) and at 1400 ppm for six hours (Union Carbide Corporation 1980, ascited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 528) have failed to identify any systemiceffects associated with exposure to this chemical. Sax (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>6th ed., 1984) liststhe effects of acute exposure to silicon tetrahydride as moderate irritationof the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes. In addition to NIOSH's comment on silicon tetrahydride, Grace Ziem, anoccupational physician, stated that she believed OSHA's reference to Sax(1984) in the proposal's discussion of silicon tetrahydride's irritanteffects was incorrect. However, OSHA notes that this notation was correct;Dr. Ziem did not realize that Sax (1984, p. 2394) has an entry for silicontetrahydride under silane, a synonym. OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 5 ppm for silicon tetrahydridein the final rule. The basis of this limit is analogy to the toxicity ofsilicon tetrahydride and other tetrahydrides. The Agency concludes thatthis limit will protect exposed workers from the significant risk of eye,skin, and upper respiratory tract irritation, which are material healthimpairments that are associated with exposure to this substance at levelsabove the new PEL. <ITAG tagnum="71">SULFURYL FLUORIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 2699-79-8; Chemical Formula: SO<T2>2</T2>F<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Theproposal retained the 8-hour TWA PEL of 5 ppm for sulfuryl fluoride andadded a STEL of 10 ppm. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred that theselimits are appropriate, and they are established in the final rule. Sulfurylfluoride is a colorless gas with a sulfide odor. When selecting this limit, the ACGIH took into consideration the fact that,compared with hydrogen fluoride (TLV-TWA ceiling of 3 ppm), only a smallportion of the inhaled gas is retained and converted to inorganic fluorides.In extensive animal studies conducted by the Dow Chemical Company (1962and 1970, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 546), sulfuryl fluoride wasdetermined to exhibit one-half to one-third the acute inhalation toxicityof methyl bromide. Acute exposures of animals resulted in tremors thatlater developed into severe convulsions. Pulmonary edema was seen in laboratoryanimals after a single severe exposure. Repeated exposures of rats, guineapigs, and mice to 20 ppm sulfuryl fluoride for seven hours per day producedboth kidney and lung injury after six months. Some evidence of fluorosiswas observed in the incisors of mice, but not in the teeth of the ratsor guinea pigs (Dow Chemical Company 1962 and 1970, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 546). A report by Taxay (1966/Ex. 1-577) that examined an incident of workplaceexposure to sulfuryl fluoride noted that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,and itching were the major symptoms. On the day following exposure, theserum of the affected worker tested positive for fluoride. No comment,other than NIOSH's, was submitted on this substance. In the final rule, OSHA is retaining the 8-hour TWA limit of 5 ppm andadding a STEL of 10 ppm for sulfuryl fluoride; these limits are based onthis substance's fluorine content. The Agency concludes that these limitswill protect workers against the significant risks of kidney and lung injuryand of fluorosis, which together constitute material health impairmentsthat are associated with exposure to this substance at levels above the8-hour TWA limit. <ITAG tagnum="71">THIONYL CHLORIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7719-09-7; Chemical Formula: C1<T2>2</T2>OS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1393</ITAG>OSHA's former Z tables had no limit for thionyl chloride. The ACGIH hasestablished a ceiling limit of 1 ppm for this substance. The proposed ceilingwas 1 ppm, and the final rule establishes this limit. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47,Table N1) concurs. Thionyl chloride is a colorless to pale yellow liquidwith a suffocating odor. Thionyl chloride vapors are skin, eye, and mucous membrane irritants, probablybecause they form sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride on contact withmoisture (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 572). An inhalation of 17.5 ppm provedlethal to cats within 20 minutes (Sax 1979/Ex. 1-866).The ACGIH's exposure limit for thionyl chloride is based on the exposurelimits for the decomposition products (hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide)of thionyl chloride when mixed with water. The reaction of one mole ofthionyl chloride with water produces two moles of hydrogen chloride andone of sulfur dioxide, so that 1 ppm of thionyl chloride can be shown toproduce a total irritant gas concentration of 3 ppm. The exposure limitfor hydrogen chloride is 5 ppm as a ceiling limit; for sulfur dioxide,the limit is a TWA of 2 ppm. Thus, ``the * * * ceiling limit of 1 ppm forthionyl chloride should prevent the irritant effects of its reaction products''(ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 572). No comments, other than NIOSH's, were receivedon this substance.In the final rule, the Agency is establishing a ceiling limit of 1 ppmfor thionyl chloride on the basis of analogy to the irritation potentialof hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide. OSHA concludes that this limitwill protect workers from the significant risk of irritation of the eyes,skin, and mucous membranes, which constitutes a material health impairmentthat is associated with exposure to this substance at levels above thenew PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">TRIBUTYL PHOSPHATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 126-73-8; Chemical Formula: (C<T2>4</T2>H<T2>9</T2>)<T2>3</T2>PO<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PEL was an 8-hour TWA of2.5 mg/m\3\; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs that this limit is appropriate.The final rule establishes an 8-hour TWA PEL of 2.5 mg/m\3\ for tributylphosphate.Tributyl phosphate's toxicity affects the skin, mucous membranes, lungs,and central nervous system, and this substance is also a cholinesteraseinhibitor.A paper by Smyth and Carpenter (1944/Ex. 1-374) reported that contact withliquid tributyl phosphate caused severe eye injury and skin irritationwhen tested in rabbits. Chambers and Casida (1967/Ex. 1-305) found thatmice injected with 1 g/kg tributyl phosphate intraperitoneally became paralyzed.A study by Vandekar (1957/Ex. 1-498) in which mice were given tributylphosphate by gavage received that a dose of 80 mg/kg resulted in a one-hourperiod of anesthesia, and a dose of 100 mg/kg resulted in 8 to 10 minutesof anesthesia, followed by respiratory failure and death. Administeredintraperitoneally to rats, tributyl phosphate inhibited cholinesteraseactivity and stimulated plasma beta-glucuronidase activity (Suzuki, Kikuchi,Kato et al. 1977/Ex. 1-1170). This substance did not exhibit mutagenicactivity in bacterial or fruit fly assays (Hanna and Dyer 1975/Ex. 1-485).Nausea and headache were reported by workers exposed to levels of 15 mg/m\3\of tributyl phosphate (Mastromatteo 1964b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 591). No comments, other than NIOSH's, were received on this substance.In the final rule, OSHA is reducing the 8-hour PEL from 5 mg/m\3\ to 2.5mg/m\3\. OSHA concludes that this limit will protect workers against thesignificant risk of paralysis, anesthetic effects, and skin or eye irritation,all of which constitute material impairments of health that are associatedwith exposure to tributyl phosphate at levels above the new PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">TRICHLOROACETIC ACID</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 76-03-9; Chemical Formula: CCl<T2>3</T2>COOH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Trichloroacetic acid is a relatively strong acid that formsdeliquescent crystals. The proposed PEL was 1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, andNIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs that this limit is appropriate. Thefinal rule established a 1-ppm 8-hour TWA for trichloroacetic acid.The Dow Chemical Company (1977p, as cited by the ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.592) reported that the oral LD<T2>50</T2> for trichloroacetic acid in rats is 3.33 g/kg. Studies on miceconducted by NIOSH (1984, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 592) establishedthat the oral LD<T2>50</T2> for this species is 4.97 g/kg, and that a 500-mg/kg dose wasfatal when administered intraperitoneally.Medical reports show mild to moderate skin and eye burns in workers exposedto unspecified levels of trichloroacetic acid; although corrosive, however,trichloroacetic acid is not readily absorbed by the skin (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 592). Only NIOSH commented on this substance.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit for trichloroaceticacid of 1 ppm.

Animalstudies showed n-valeraldehyde's to be severely irritating when appliedto guinea pig skin and to rabbits' eyes (Fassett, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 619). The dermal LD<T2>50</T2> for guinea pigs exceeds 20 ml/kg (Fassett, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 619).A series of studies of the relative acute inhalation toxicity of 13 aliphaticsaturated and unsaturated aldehydes in mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits showedthat valeraldehyde was relatively nontoxic systemically (Salem and Cullumbine1960/Ex. 1-360). Only NIOSH commented on this substance.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 50-ppm 8-hour TWA limit for thispreviously unregulated chemical. The Agency concludes that this limit willprotect workrs from the significant risk of severe eye and skin irritationassociated with exposure to this substance at levels above the new PEL.<ITAG tagnum="71">m-XYLENE ALPHA, ALPHA</ITAG>andmin172;-DIAMINE<ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1477-55-0; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>(CH<T2>2</T2>NH<T2>2</T2>)<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH has establisheda limit of 0.1 mg/m\3\ as a ceiling that should not be exceeded duringany part of a working day, and has added a skin notation to indicate thatsubstantial percutaneous absorption can occur through the eyes, mucousmembranes, and skin. OSHA proposed a ceiling of 0.1 mg/m3 for this substance,with a skin notation, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs. These limitsare established by the final rule. m-Xylene alpha, alphaandmin172;-diamine(MXDA) is a colorless liquid.Animal studies have demonstrated that MXDA is strongly irritating to theskin (Haskell Laboratory 1973, Sherwin-Williams Company 1978, both as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 638). Research at du Pont (Haskell Laboratory1973, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 638) showed that pure MXDA wascorrosive when applied to the skin of guinea pigs, and a 50-percent MXDAsolution caused severe irritation in these animals. In a separate study(Sherwin-Williams Company 1978, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 638),a 10-percent mixture of MXDA caused severe skin irritation and erythemain guinea pigs. Sherwin-Williams (1978, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 638) also reported that rats exposed to levels of MXDA ranging from1.74 to 6.04 mg/liter even for one hour sustained liver, kidney, and lungdamage, as determined at necropsy. One study showed mild sensitizationwhen MXDA was applied to guinea pig skin, but this effect was not observedin a second study (Sherwin-Williams Company 1978, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 638). NIOSH was the sole commenter on this substance.OSHA concludes that a ceiling limit of 0.1 mg/m3 and a skin notation arenecessary to protect against the significant risk of skin irritation, percutaneousabsorption of MXDA, and potential systemic effects, all of which constititutematerial impairments of health. The Agency has determined that these limitswill substantially reduce this significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="71">XYLIDINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1300-73-8; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2>C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>3</T2>NH<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1433</ITAG>OSHA's former Z tables included an exposure limit of 5 ppm as an 8-hourTWA for xylidine, with a skin notation. In 1982, the ACGIH reduced itsTLV to 2 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and retained the skin notation. The proposedPEL was 2 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, and the skin notation was retained. NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs with these limits, and they are establishedby the final rule. Xylidine is a pale yellow to brown liquid. Commercialxylidine is a mixture of isomers.Several studies indicate that the former OSHA PEL for xylidine is insufficientto protect workers against hepatotoxic and other adverse effects. A paperby von Oettingen, Neal, Sievers et al. (1947), as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 639) reported liver damage in dogs, rats, cats, and mice repeatedlyexposed to 45 ppm xylidine for seven hours per day for a period of 20 to40 weeks; these exposures also caused death in dogs cats, and mice. Treon,Sigmon, Wright et al. (1950/Ex. 1-533) noted cardiac, liver, and kidneydamage in animals fatally exposed at the following doses: Cats, 17 ppm;guinea pigs, 50 ppm; and rabbits, 60 ppm; cyanosis was also observed inthese animals. Only NIOSH commented on xylidine.In the final rule, OSHA is reducing the existing 8-hour TWA to 2 ppm andretaining the skin notation for xylidine. The Agency concludes that theselimits will protect workers from the significant risk of exposure-relatedcardiac, kidney, and liver damage, all of which constitute material healthimpairments.Conclusions For This Group of SubstancesExposure to the 73 substances included in this category place workers atsignificant risk of material health impairment and functional incapacity.The adverse health consequences of exposure to these chemicals includeneuropathies, skin and respiratory tract irritation, kidney and liver damage,and gastrointestinal disorders, all of which constitute material healthimpairments within the meaning of the Act. OSHA concludes, based on therecord evidence, that the new or revised limits for these hazardous substanceswill substantially reduce these significant occupational risks.<ITAG tagnum="81">13. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Biochemical/MetabolicEffects </ITAG>Introduction One basis for establishing exposure limits is the ability of many toxicsubstances to interfere with the normal metabolism or biochemistry of thebody. A total of 26 substances for which OSHA is establishing limits fallinto this group. Table C13-1 shows these substances, their former, proposed,and final rule PELs, and their CAS and HS numbers. For four of these substances,OSHA is only lowering the 8-hour TWA; for two other substances, the Agencyis retaining the 8-hour limit and adding a STEL. In one instance, OSHAis reducing the TWA and adding a ceiling. In one case (terphenyls), OSHAis reducing a ceiling limit, and for 17 substances, new limits are beingestablished. In the case of p-nitrochlorobenzene, OSHA is retaining theformer limit of 1 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 003 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 1217-1219 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C  </ITAG>Description of the Health Effects The compounds shown in Table C13-1 are further divided into the followingsub-classes, based on their mechanism of action: andbullet; Substances that are cholinesterase inhibitors; andbullet; Substances that interferes with the oxygen-carrying capacity ofblood; andbullet; Substances with Antabuse-like effects. The disruption of metabolic processes by toxic substances, if severe enough,results in potentially dangerous effects on the neurological, cardiovascular,and respiratory systems. The adverse health consequences caused by exposureto chemicals having cholinesterase inhibition effects range from wheezing,nausea, vomiting, and confusion to respiratory failure, coma, and death.If exposure has localized rather than systemic effects, the signs and symptomsof cholinesterase inhibition can include sweating, blurred vision, andconstriction of the bronchial tubes. Substances that interfere with theability of the blood to carry oxygen cause a broad range of symptoms, includingfainting, loss of consciousness, rapid heartbeat, headache, nausea, coma,and death. Carbon monoxide (CO) is the best-known substance in this categoryof chemicals, and exposure to CO is common throughout industry. The Antabuse-like effects associated with exposure to three chemicals_disulfiram,cyanamide, and calcium cyanamide_include facial flushing, nausea, and aracing heartbeat. However, these effects are manifested only if the exposedindividual has ingested alcohol. The three chemicals in this subgroup causethis effect by inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, which is involvedin the biotransformation of alcohol. For chemicals that cause systemic toxicity in animals and/or humans, thegrossly observable signs and symptoms of intoxication are usually secondaryto the interaction of the chemical with a molecular target. In other words,the chemical interacts with (binds with or modifies) an endogenous molecularconstituent (protein, nucleic acid, lipid, etc.) in the target tissue(s).The result of the interaction is ordinarily a modification or eliminationof the normal function of the specific molecular constituent which, ifsufficiently severe, may lead to secondary effects within the affectedcells and/or tissues. It is possible for a number of molecules to be affectedby the toxic chemical without there being any overt manifestation of toxicity.In other words, there is an apparent no-effect level governing the overtmanifestation of toxicity, although there are usually metabolic effectsat levels below those that cause overt effects. For chemicals for which the molecular target is known and for which methodsare available to detect the altered molecular target, it is possible touse the measure of altered biochemical function as a sensitive indicatorof exposure to the chemicals at levels below those that cause grossly observablesigns and symptoms of poisoning. For other classes of chemicals, studiesin animals and/or humans have shed light on the biochemical basis of theirtoxicity. For some of these classes of chemicals, it is possible to baselimits of human exposure on biochemical, metabolic, or pharmacologic indicatorsof their interaction with molecular targets rather than on grossly visiblesigns and symptoms of adverse systemic effects. <T3>Substances that are cholinesterase inhibitors. </T3>A number of organophosphateand carbamate insecticides produce acute toxicity in humans through inhibitionof acetylcholinesterase at cholinergic synapses in the central and peripheralnervous systems. There are 14 substances in this group. This inhibitioncauses an accumulation of acetylcholine at the effector sites and elicitssigns and symptoms consistent with excessive cholinergic activity. Theseinclude bronchoconstriction; increased bronchial secretions, salivation,and lacrimation; nausea; vomiting; cramps; constriction of the pupils;muscular weakness; and cardiac irregularities. If sufficiently severe,acetylcholinesterase inhibition may cause coma, irreversible CNS damage,and death.The mechanisms by which carbamates and organophosphates inhibit acetyl-cholinesterasediffer. In general, carbamates form a noncovalently bound complex withthe enzyme, while most organophosphates bind covalently with the enzyme.The net result, inactivation of the enzyme, is similar for both groups.In either case, the inhibition is usually reversible. The carbamate-cholinesterasecomplex dissociates to regenerate the active enzyme, while cholinesteraseinactivated by organophosphates is replaced by the <T3>de novo </T3>synthesis of active enzyme. Therefore, unless the inhibitionis sufficiently severe to cause brain damage or death, the manifestationsof acute toxicity are reversible, and poisoned individuals recover withoutsequelae. A significant proportion of endogenous cholinesterase activitymay be inhibited before the overt manifestations of intoxication appear.The fraction of total cholinesterase activity that can be inhibited withoutthere being signs and symptoms of toxicity varies from individual to individualand also appears to depend on the intensity and duration of exposure. Thelack of warning signs at low levels of exposure increases the need to setexposure limits at levels that will protect those individuals who do notreadily manifest the symptoms and signs of toxicity from experiencing thesubclinical effects of exposure.<T3>Substances that interfere with the oxygen-carrying capacity of theblood. </T3>Nine compounds in this section produce their immediate toxicityin humans by altering the ability of hemoglobin in the red blood cellsto bind, transport, and release oxygen. Perhaps the best studied of theseis carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin with a greateraffinity than does oxygen. It also alters the dissociation characteristicsfor the oxygen-hemoglobin complex. The overall effect is to reduce theoxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Also included in this overall categoryof compounds is a group of aromatic amines and nitro compounds that reactwith hemoglobin in the blood to reduce it to methemoglobin. Methemoglobinwill not bind with oxygen and therefore is not an effective carrier ofoxygen.Because these compounds reduce the ability of the blood to transport oxygen,the overt signs and symptoms of acute toxicity are those of tissue anoxia,i.e., neurobehavioral disturbances, dizziness, cardiac irregularities,cyanosis, unconsciousness, and death. The severity of the symptoms is afunction of the degree to which the oxygen-carrying capacity of the bloodhas been depleted and of the state of the exposed individual's health.In the case of carbon monoxide, individuals with pre-existing cardiovasculardisease or healthy individuals engaged in physical labor may be placedat increased risk when more than 5 percent of their hemoglobin is boundto carbon monoxide.In the cases of both carbon monoxide and the methemoglobin-forming compounds,the primary effect (i.e., formation of carboxyhemoglobin or methemoglobin)is reversible. In the absence of additional carbon monoxide exposure, carboxyhemoglobindissociates to carbon monoxide and fully functional hemoglobin. Methemoglobincan be reoxidized to hemoglobin by endogenous mechanisms, but the majorrecovery mechanism is via the synthesis of new hemoglobin.<T3>Substances with Antabuse-like effects. </T3>The ingestion of alcoholicbeverages following exposure to disulfiram, cyanamide, or calcium cyanamideresults in a characteristic syndrome consisting of flushing of the face,nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and increased heart rate. If exposure isparticularly severe, the reaction may trigger convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias,or heart attacks and has in some cases caused death. In the vast majorityof less severe cases, the reaction is fully reversible, although the symptomsare temporarily completely disabling. Disulfiram (Antabuse) is used therapeuticallyin the treatment of chronic alcoholism; employees who are currently beingtreated with disulfiram for alcoholism are therefore at particularly highrisk if they are also occupationally exposed to these substances that causeAntabuse-like effects. These compounds do not cause any signs or symptomsof toxicity in the absence of alcohol ingestion unless exposure levelsare far above those that trigger the alcohol-induced response.Dose-Response Relationships and Biochemical/Metabolic Effects <T3>Substances that are cholinesterase inhibitors. </T3>Typically, thecholinesterase inhibition potential of a compound is assessed by measuringplasma cholinesterase activity in the treated organism. Data from experimentsin animals and limited data from human clinical trials indicate that thepercentage of basal plasma cholinesterase activity decreases with increasingdose and that the dose-response curve is S-shaped. Because there is inter-individualvariation in this relationship, the dose-response curve for a populationexposed to a cholinesterase inhibitor would be expected to be much shallowerin slope and to have longer tails than the dose-response curve for anysingle individual.The relationship between the dose-response curve for plasma cholinesteraseinhibition and the dose-response curves for more direct indicators of clinicalintoxication, such as acetylcholinesterase activity in the CNS or the actualappearance of signs of intoxication, is not known. Evidence suggests thatthere is considerable inter-individual variability in these relationships.Some individuals may be free of the symptoms and signs of intoxicationwhen their plasma cholinesterase levels have been inhibited by as muchas 90 percent, while others may experience symptoms after only a smalldecrease in plasma cholinesterase activity. Because of this variability,any exposure limit should be set with this individual variability in mind.<T3>Substances that interfere with oxygen transport. </T3>Both carboxyhemoglobinand methemoglobin formation exhibit a classical sigmoidal dose-responserelationship in relation to exposure to carbon monoxide or methemoglobin-formingcompounds. The loss in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is a functionof the intensity and duration of exposure. As stated above, the majorityof healthy individuals can tolerate some reduction in the oxygen-carryingcapacity of their blood without experiencing symptoms of overt toxicity.However, there is great inter-individual variability in the degree of decreasedoxygen-carrying capacity that can be tolerated without apparent ill effect.Individuals with pre-existing anemia or with high carboxyhemoglobin levelsas a result of other environmental exposures (e.g., smoking) may alreadybe at or above the level at which they will display the signs or experiencethe symptoms of tissue anoxia. For these individuals, even a small incrementaldecrease in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood can have seriousconsequences.<T3>Substances causing Antabuse-like effects. </T3>The dose-response characteristicsof disulfiram, cyanamide, and calcium cyanamide follow the usual S-shapedcurve. The final rule's limits for the substances in this group have beenset at levels below those associated with the Antabuse effect in workersingesting alcohol either during or after work.The following paragraphs describe the record evidence and the Agency'sfindings with respect to the substances that cause metabolic disturbances.The discussions below also illustrate the risk of material health impairmentassociated with exposure to these substances.<ITAG tagnum="71">ANILINE (AND HOMOLOGS)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 62-53-3; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>NH<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1025</ITAG>The former OSHA 8-hour TWA permissible exposure limit for aniline was 5ppm, with a skin notation. The ACGIH-recommended 8-hour TLV is a 2-ppmTWA, with a skin notation. The proposed PEL was 2 ppm as an 8-hour TWA,and this limit is established in the final rule. The skin notation is retained.Aniline, when first distilled, is an oily, colorless liquid that darkenson exposure to air.Occupational aniline poisoning was a relatively common occurrence in earlieryears (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 30). The early limits for aniline were setto guard against acute toxicity manifested as cyanosis (Henderson and Haggard1943i, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 30). Cirrhosis and chronic CNSeffects were also reported (Holstein 1955/Ex. 1-913; von Oettingen 1941/Ex.1-874). Skin absorption occurs when aniline vapor contacts the skin (Dutkiewicz1962, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 30); the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 820 mg/kg (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, </T3>7th ed., Sax andLewis 1989, p. 262).Early studies suggested that less than full-shift exposures of 7 to 53ppm of aniline vapor caused mild symptoms, while one-hour inhalation exposuresto concentrations in the range of 100 to 160 ppm caused severe effects(Henderson and Haggard 1943i, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 30). Laterstudies in several species of animals found no effects, other than a slightincrease in methemoglobin in the blood of rats, after the animals had beenexposed to aniline concentrations of 5 ppm for six months (Oberst, Hackley,and Comstock 1956/Ex. 1-685). An early NCI aniline hydrochloride cancerbioassay in Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice demonstrated carcinogeniceffects, primarily in the spleens of rats, but multiple organ sites werealso involved in rats fed 0.6 percent or 0.3 percent aniline hydrochloridefor 103 weeks (NCI 1978a/Ex. 1-1118).NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A) testified (Tr. III-96/97) that aniline andits analogs are carcinogens; NIOSH concurred that the limit establishedby OSHA for aniline and its homologues is appropriate. However, NIOSH isof the opinion that OSHA should designate substances suspected of havingcarcinogenic potential as carcinogens. This issue is discussed in SectionV of the preamble. OSHA received no other comments on aniline and its homologues.OSHA has concluded that the former limit of 5 ppm is not sufficiently protective,since systemic effects have been observed in humans exposed to levels aslow as 7 ppm and in animals at levels as low as 5 ppm. Accordingly, OSHAis establishing an 8-hour TWA of 2 ppm for aniline and retaining the skinnotation, which will protect against percutaneous absorption. The Agencyhas determined that this limit will substantially reduce the significantrisk of methemoglobinemia, which constitutes a material impairment of health,seen in exposed animals at the former level. The Agency intends to continueto monitor the evidence on the carcinogenicity of aniline in the futureto determine whether other action is appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="71">CALCIUM CYANAMIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 156-62-7; Chemical Formula: CaNC-N</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1058</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no limit for calcium cyanamide. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWAof 0.5 mg/m3 for this crystalline gray material. The proposed PEL was an8-hour TWA of 0.5 mg/m3, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs with thislimit, which is established in the final rule.  Data regarding the acute toxicity of calcium cyanamide are sparse. Theoral LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 1400 mg/kg, and that for rats is 1000 mg/kg (Spencer1973, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 91).  Skin and eye irritation have been reported in rats and rabbits, with significantirritation occurring when 100 mg of calcium cyanamide is placed directlyinto the eyes of rabbits (Martin 1975, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 91). Severe skin irritation developed in rabbits when a paste of thissubstance was applied to the shaved abdominal skin for 24 hours (Martin1975, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 91). Two of five animals diedwhen the dose was 10 g/kg, but all survived a dose of 5 g/kg.  Most cases of industrial calcium cyanamide poisoning involve primary skinirritation or sensitizing dermatitis. Skin irritation develops in the formof an erythematous rash over the surfaces of the body that are exposedto the substance of those body surfaces irritated by clothing or perspiration.Some individuals develop a macular rash on exposure, and this may progressto the weeping stage. In addition, exposed workers may develop temporaryvasomotor disturbances of the upper body, with susceptibility increasingwith alcohol intake (Fassett 1963d, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.91). Calcium cyanamide is used medically for its Antabuse-like effect,and the maintenance dose in adults is between 50 and 100 mg/day (Hald,Jacobsen, and Larson 1952/Ex. 1-905). No comments, other than NIOSH's,were received on this substance.  In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.5 mg/m3for calcium cyanamide. The Agency concludes that this limit will substantiallyreduce the significant risks of material health impairment in the formof eye and skin irritation, sensitizing dermatitis, and the occurrenceof Antabuse-like effects, which were possible at the levels of exposureformerly permitted by the absence of an OSHA limit.<ITAG tagnum="71">CARBOFURAN</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1563-66-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>12</T2>H<T2>15</T2>NO<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1068</ITAG>Previously, OSHA had no limit for carbofuran. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of0.1 mg/m3 for this white crystalline solid. The proposed PEL for carbofuranwas 0.1 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA, and NIOSH concurred with this limit (Ex.8-47, Table N1), which is established in the final rule.  Tobin (1970/Ex. 1-935) reports that the LC<T2>50</T2> of 50-percent wettable carbofuran powder is 108 mg/m3 for maleand 133 mg/m3 for female rats; a respiratory LC<T2>50</T2> of 53 mg/m3 for guinea pigs exposed to the 75-percent wettablepowder is also reported (Tobin 1970/Ex. 1-935). Rhesus monkeys did notdisplay cholinesterase depression at levels equivalent to 0.56 mg/m3 of75-percent wettable powder (Tobin 1970/Ex. 1-935). Chronic feeding studiesin the rat have shown no effects at 25 ppm; in the dog, the no-effect levelwas 20 ppm (Gaines, unpublished data, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.100). Inhibition of plasma, erythrocyte, and brain cholinesterase levelswas evident at levels of 50 ppm in the diet (Tobin 1970/Ex. 1-935). Six-hourexposures at levels of 0.86 mg/m3 caused significant cholinesterase inhibitionin animals (Tobin 1970/Ex. 1-935).  Workers exposed at concentrations approaching 0.1 mg/m3 have not shownany adverse effects (Tobin, personal communication to ACGIH TLV Committee,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 100). No comments, other than NIOSH's,were received on carbofuran.  In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a permissible exposure limit of0.1 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA for this substance to protect employees fromthe significant risk of cholinesterase inhibition potentially associatedwith exposure to this previously unregulated substance. The Agency concludesthat this limit will substantially reduce this significant occupationalrisk of material impairment of health.<ITAG tagnum="71">CARBON DIOXIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 124-38-9; Chemical Formula: CO<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1069</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for carbon dioxide was 5000 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. TheACGIH has a 5000-ppm TLV-TWA with a 30,000-ppm TLV-STEL, and these werethe limits proposed. NIOSH has a TWA REL of 10,000 ppm with a 10-minute30,000-ppm ceiling limit; however, NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurredthat the proposed limits were appropriate. After carefully reviewing therecord evidence submitted in response to OSHA's proposal for carbon dioxide,the Agency has determined that exposure limits of 10,000 ppm (8-hour TWA)and 30,000 ppm (15-minute STEL) are appropriate. Carbon dioxide is a colorless,odorless, noncombustible gas.  Both the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) and NIOSH (1976a, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 102) cite studies indicating that continuous exposure to between1.5 and 3 percent carbon dioxide (15,000 to 30,000 ppm) results in few,if any, adverse effects. However, electrolyte imbalances and other metabolicchanges have been associated with prolonged exposure to 10,000 to 20,000ppm CO<T2>2</T2> (Schulte 1964/Ex. 1-366; Gray 1950, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 102). Increases in the rate of respiration have been observed amongresting subjects exposed to 39,500 ppm for periods shorter than a day andamong exercising subjects exposed to airborne concentrations below 30,000for the same period (Sinclair et al. 1969, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 102).  OSHA received comments on carbon dioxide from the American Iron and SteelInstitute (AISI) (Ex. 1-1123; Tr. p. 11-24) and the Corn Refiners Association(Ex. 177), among others; both organizations listed CO<T2>2</T2> as a substance affecting their respective industries but didnot provide further information. OSHA also received comments from the BeerInstitute (Exs. 49 and 142; Tr. 8/9/88, p. 9-26) and from the Anheuser-BuschCompany (Ex. 199).  The Beer Institute (Exs. 49 and 142; Tr. 8/9/88, p. 9-26) and the BrewingIndustry Safety Advisory Committee submitted comments to OSHA on carbondioxide. This industry's position is that there is no health risk to employeesexposed to CO<T2>2</T2>, even at levels between 15,000 and 20,000 ppm for an 8-hourperiod (Ex. 49, p. 2). In support of this position, the Beer Institutetestified that the 8-hour TWA limit of 5000 ppm is ``unnecessarily lowand restrictive'' (Ex. 49; Tr. 8/9/88, p. 9-27). The Institute also submitteda study by Riley and Bromberger-Barnea (1979/Ex. 49B) on the CO<T2>2</T2> exposure of brewery workers. This study monitored the full-shiftexposures of these workers to CO<T2>2</T2> and determined that they average 1.08 percent CO<T2>2</T2> (10,800 ppm).  The Beer Institute testified that the beer industry ``is unique relativeto carbon dioxide exposure and control. * * * no other industry faces thesame engineering difficulties for controlling ambient carbon dioxide asthe brewing industry'' (Tr. 8/9/88, p. 9-26). These commenters identifiedtwo situations where exposure to CO<T2>2</T2> might be a problem for cellar workers (Tr. 8/9/88, p. 9-27).The first situation occurs when excessive CO<T2>2</T2> builds up in the large fermentation tanks used in the beer-makingprocess and blows an escape valve, and the second exposure situation ariseswhen workers must enter the fermentation tanks to flush out the sludgeremaining after the tank has been drained. OSHA finds that these situationsinvolve either upset conditions (safety valve blowout) or maintenance (tankcleaning); both of these operations are considered nonroutine, and respiratoryprotection may be used to protect employees when these situations arise.OSHA's analysis of the technological feasibility of achieving the finalrule's limits in facilities in the beer industry is presented in SectionVII of this preamble.In response to these commenters, OSHA notes that the limit to which theseindustry spokesmen are objecting is the CO<T2>2</T2> limit that has been in force since the Agency was founded in1971. Neither the Beer Institute nor the Brewing Industry Safety AdvisoryCommittee objects to the only change OSHA proposed in this rulemaking (i.e.,the addition of a 30,000-ppm STEL for CO<T2>2</T2>). According to Gary Nateman, Vice President of the Beer Institute(Tr. 8/9/88, pp. 9-30):<ITAG tagnum="21">It is appropriate in our view for OSHA to adopt the 3-percent [30,000-ppm]short-term exposure limit for carbon dioxide. There is a scientific basisfor this limit and in terms of real health benefit, this is the most meaningfulapproach (Tr. 8/9/88, pp. 9-31).</ITAG>The basis for the beer industry's objection to the retention of OSHA's5000-ppm limit is that NIOSH recommended a higher 8-hour TWA limit of 10,000ppm in its 1976 criteria document for carbon dioxide (NIOSH 1976a, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 102).After reviewing this evidence, OSHA is persuaded that a 10,000-ppm 8-hourTWA limit, combined with a 30,000-ppm STEL, will protect employees fromthe adverse effects associated with excessive exposures to CO<T2>2</T2>. OSHA bases this conclusion on the fact that, while the evidencehas not shown that prolonged exposures to 10,000-ppm are harmful, acuteexposures to CO<T2>2</T2> concentrations in excess of 30,000-ppm have been demonstratedto cause changes in respiration rates in humans.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 10,000-ppm PEL as an 8-hour TWAand a 30,000-ppm STEL to protect employees from experiencing the metabolicand respiratory changes, which constitute material health impairments,that are associated with elevated short-term CO<T2>2</T2> exposures. The Agency concludes that adding this limit willsubstantially reduce the risk associated with the high short-term exposuresto CO<T2>2</T2> that are possible in the absence of a STEL. The former 8-hourTWA of 5000 ppm is retained.<ITAG tagnum="71">CARBON MONOXIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 630-08-0; Chemical Formula: CO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1071</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for carbon monoxide was 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA. TheACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 50 ppm with a TLV-STEL of 400 ppm. NIOSH (1973d/Ex.1-237) recommends an 8-hour TWA limit of 35 ppm with a 200-ppm ceiling.The proposed PEL and ceiling were 35 ppm and 200 ppm, respectively; NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs that these limits are appropriate, and theyare established in the final rule. Carbon monoxide is a flammable, colorless,practically odorless gas.Carbon monoxide readily combines with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin(COHb). Excessive accumulations of COHb cause hypoxic stress in healthyindividuals as a result of the reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of theblood. In patients with cardiovascular disease, such stress can furtherimpair cardiovascular function. The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) cites a numberof studies showing that exposure to 50 ppm TWA carbon monoxide generallyresults in COHb levels of 8 to 10 percent, and that such levels are notgenerally associated with overt signs or symptoms of health impairmentin healthy individuals under nonstressful conditions. However, the ACGIHcomments that a TLV of 25 ppm, which results in COHb levels of 4 percentor less, may be necessary to protect workers with cardiovascular disease,because this condition places workers at higher risk of serious cardiovascularinjury (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 106). The NIOSH recommendation of 35 ppmTWA is also aimed at protecting workers with chronic heart disease; NIOSHbelieves that such workers should not be allowed to have carboxyhemoglobinlevels that approach 5 percent. The rationale for the ACGIH's recommendationof a 400-ppm TLV-STEL for CO is not entirely clear, but may be based ona study by Schulte (1964/Ex. 1-366), which stated that exposure to 10 ppmcarbon monoxide for four hours is excessive.Several commenters (Exs. 133, 188, 3-675, 3-673, L3-1330, 3-902, 3-660,3-349, 3-1123, and 129) submitted comments on the Agency's proposed limitsfor carbon monoxide. Some of these commenters (Exs. 3-675 and 3-673) wereconcerned that the revised limits would have serious economic impacts ontheir industries (electric utilities, steel, and nonferrous foundries).However, OSHA has determined that it is feasible for facilities in thesesectors to comply with the proposed CO limits (see Section VII of the preamble).Many rulemaking participants questioned the health basis for lowering theformer CO limit of 50 ppm as an 8-hour TWA to 35 ppm and supplementingthis limit with a 200-ppm STEL (Exs. 133A, 188, 3-660, 3-349, 3-1123, and129). These commenters pointed out that the discussion of CO's health effectsin the preamble to the proposal (53 FR 21171) stated that the carboxyhemoglobinlevels associated with CO exposures of 50 ppm ``are not associated withtoxic effects in healthy individuals.'' According to the American Ironand Steel Institute (Ex. 3-1123), whose remarks were typical of the viewsof these commenters:<ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed PEL should not be adopted because there is not adequateevidence that exposure to carbon monoxide at levels of 50 ppm TWA posesa significant risk to workers with heart or pulmonary disease * * * (Ex.3-1123, p. 23).</ITAG>H.K. Thompson, Corporate Industrial Hygiene Manager of Caterpillar, Inc.(Ex. 3-349), stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">PELs or TLVs are not set to protect individuals with chronic heartdisease. In our industry we transfer people with disabilities to jobs wherethe risk for them is minimal (Ex. 3-349, p. 3).</ITAG>In response to these commenters, OSHA quotes the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3):<ITAG tagnum="21">Each molecule of CO combining with hemoglobin reduces the oxygen carryingcapacity of the blood and exerts a finite stress on man. Thus, it may bereasoned that there is <T3>no dose of CO</T3> that is not without an effect on the body. Whetherthat effect is physiologic or harmful <T3>depends upon the dose of CO and the state of health of the exposedindividual.</T3> The body compensates for this hypoxic stress by increasingcardiac output and blood flow to specific organs, such as the brain orthe heart. When this ability to compensate is overpowered or is limitedby disease, tissue injury results [emphasis added].</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Exposure to CO sufficient to produce COHb saturations in the 3-5%range impairs cardiovascular function in patients with cardiovascular diseaseand in normal subjects * * *. The primary effect of exposure to low concentrationsof CO on workmen results from the hypoxic stress secondary to the reductionin the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood * * *. Workmen with significantdisease, both detected and undetected, may not be able to compensate adequatelyand are at risk of serious injury. For such workers, a TLV of 25 ppm ** * might be necessary. Even such a concentration might be detrimentalto the health of some workers who might have far advanced cardiovasculardisease * * *. It would appear to the Committee that the time-weightedTLV of 50 ppm for carbon monoxide might also be too high under conditionsof heavy labor, high temperatures, or at high elevations (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 106).</ITAG>Thus, the ACGIH also regards a lower limit for CO as necessary to protectworkers with cardiovascular or pulmonary disease or those working understressful conditions.NIOSH (Ex. 150, Comments on Carbon Monoxide) submitted a substantial amountof posthearing evidence demonstrating the significant risk associated withCO exposure, particularly with respect to coronary heart disease. The followingstudies are particularly relevant to this issue. Atkins and Baker (1985,as cited in NIOSH/Ex. 150) report the case of two workers with preexistingcoronary artery disease who died after exposure to CO at work. A studyof firefighters in Los Angeles (Barnard and Weber 1979, as cited in NIOSH/Ex.150) suggests that CO exposure during firefighting may be responsible forthe high incidence of heart disease in firefighters; peak exposures duringfire fighting were as high as 3000 ppm CO, with 40 percent of peak valuesin the 100- to 500-ppm CO range. A prevalence study by Hernberg et al.(1976, as cited in NIOSH/Ex. 150) reports a clear dose-response relationshipbetween CO exposure and angina pectoris in foundry workers. Stern and co-workers(1981, as cited in NIOSH/Ex. 150) suggest that the slight overall excessof deaths in motor vehicle examiners caused by cardiovascular disease isattributable to chronic exposure to low levels of CO (10 to 24 ppm as an8-hour TWA). The AFL-CIO's posthearing comment (Ex. 194) agrees that thecomments submitted by NIOSH are persuasive evidence of the need to reducethe 8-hour TWA for CO. NIOSH also submitted recent data on carbon monoxide's reproductive effectsand on its neurotoxic/behavioral effects. Based on a review of all of thesestudies, NIOSH concludes that ``[t]he new data suggest a reevaluation ofthe REL and strongly support the inference that there is a significantrisk of material impairment to health at the * * * [former] 50-ppm PELwhich will be reduced by the proposed 35-ppm PEL'' (Ex. 150, Comments onCarbon Monoxide).OSHA notes that cardiovascular disease (detected or undetected) and pulmonaryimpairment are widespread in the general population in this country, andthat workers constitute a significant part of this general population.In addition, workers regularly encounter complex and stressful situationsat work, including heat stress, jobs demanding heavy exertion, and tasksrequiring both judgment and motor coordination.The AISI (Ex. 129) submitted an article (Redmond, Emes, Mazumdar et al.1977, ``Mortality of Steelworkers Employed in Hot Jobs'') to OSHA which,in the opinion of the AISI, demonstrates that steelworkers who are exposedto high heat (and ostensibly also to CO) do not have coronary heart disease.Based on this article, the AISI asks that the steel industry be exemptedfrom the revised PEL for CO. OSHA finds the article submitted by the AISIunconvincing on the point at issue; the article is not primarily concernedwith CO exposures but with heat stress and, further, does not include alarge enough sample to demonstrate the absence of the effect. Moreover,OSHA is establishing limits that will apply to all of general industry;the Agency does not customarily set standards based on the particular conditionsprevailing in a specific operation or industry. However, some evidence has been submitted by the AISI (Ex. 129) to theeffect that the ceiling limit cannot regularly be achieved with engineeringand work practice controls in specific operations in SIC 33. These operationsare: blast furnace operations, vessel blowing at basic oxygen furnaces,and sinter plant operations. There is no evidence to the contrary in therecord. For these operations, OSHA will therefore permit more flexibilityin the use of respirators. The burden of proof will not be on employersto demonstrate that compliance with the ceiling by means of engineeringand work practice controls is infeasible in any compliance action involvingthese operations in SIC 33. There may be a few other operations that fall into this same category;however, the record is unclear on this point. Based on an appropriate showingpursuant to the OSH Act, OSHA will favorably consider requests for variancesfor specific operations in SIC 33 involving methods of compliance for theceiling limit. Of course, all requests for variances or any other matterswill be considered based on their merits. OSHA thus finds that the reduced 8-hour TWA of 35 ppm for carbon monoxideis needed to reduce the significant risk of serious injury that has repeatedlybeen demonstrated to result from overexposure to CO in a host of occupationalenvironments. The Agency concludes that a ceiling of 200 ppm is necessaryto ensure that peak CO exposures do not reach levels demonstrated to behazardous and that overall full-shift exposures remain under good control.In the absence of a ceiling, concentrations approaching the Immediately-Dangerous-to-Life-or-Health(IDLH) level of 1500 ppm could occur. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 35 ppm and a ceilingof 200 ppm as the PELs for carbon monoxide to ensure that employee COHblevels are maintained at or below 5 percent, in order to protect thoseworkers at greater risk because of cardiovascular or pulmonary impairment.In addition, these revised limits will protect healthy workers who mustwork in environments involving exertion, heat stress, or other strenuousconditions. The Agency has determined that these limits will substantiallyreduce the significant occupational risk associated with both chronic andpeak CO exposures in the workplace. OSHA concludes that the hypoxic stressassociated with overexposures to carbon monoxide clearly constitutes amaterial impairment of health and functional capacity. <ITAG tagnum="71">CHLORPYRIFOS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 2921-88-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>9</T2>H<T2>11</T2>C1<T2>3</T2>NO<T2>3</T2>PS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1091</ITAG>OSHA had no former limit for chlorpyrifos. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 0.2mg/m\3\ and a 0.6-mg/m\3\ STEL, with a skin notation, for this white, crystallinesolid. The proposed PELs were an 8-hour TWA of 0.2 mg/m\3\ and a 15-minuteSTEL of 0.6 mg/m\3\, with a skin notation; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurswith these limits. The 0.2-mg/m\3\ 8-hour TWA and a skin notation are establishedin the final rule, but the proposed STEL is not retained.Chlorpyrifos has an acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> of 135 mg/kg for female rats and 163 for male rats (Windholz1983b, pp. 309-310, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 138). Other sourceshave reported the acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> as 82 mg/kg in rats and the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> as about 2000 mg/kg for rabbits (Gray 1965/Ex. 1-1151; Gaines1969/Ex. 1-320).Chlorpyrifos is an active inhibitor of plasma cholinesterase but has onlymoderate capacity to reduce red blood cell cholinesterase or to cause cholinergicsymptoms and systemic injury (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 138). Particle inhalationhas been shown to cause mild plasma cholinesterase depression in dogs exposedfor four hours at the upper end of a 140- to 280-mg/m\3\ range (Spencer1968, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 138).Dogs and rats fed 3.0 mg/kg of chlorpyrifos daily for two years showedno adverse effects (FAO/WHO (Food and Agriculture Organization/World HealthOrganization) 1972, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 138). Male and femalerats showed no teratogenic or reproductive effects when fed 1.0 mg/kg perday (Dow Chemical Company 1972a, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 138).Workers applying chlorpyrifos as a spray were exposed to 0.5 percent chlorpyrifosemulsion and exhibited a marked decrease in plasma and red cell cholinesteraselevels (Eliason, Cranmer, von Windeguth et al. 1969/Ex. 1-633). In fiveof seven exposed sprayers, this reduction was greater than 50 percent.However, another study showed no ill effects on cholinesterase metabolismwhen human volunteers were exposed to an ultra-low-volume spray (0.8 um/m\3\for three to eight minutes) (Ludwig, Kilian, Dishburger, and Edwards 1970/Ex.1-563). Human cholinesterase levels appear to be less affected by dermalexposure than do those of rabbits (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 138). However,human volunteers, administered four repeated dermal doses of 25 mg/kg,applied for 12 hours each, did exhibit depressed plasma cholinesteraselevels. Human subjects ingesting 0.03 mg/kg for three weeks showed no cholinesteraseeffects, but subjects ingesting 0.1 mg/kg demonstrated plasma cholinesterasedepression (Dow Chemical Compnay 1973f, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 138).The American Industrial Hygiene Association (Ex. 8-16; Tr. III, p. 307)urged OSHA to delete the proposed 0.6-mg/m\3\ STEL for chlorpyrifos becausethe ACGIH has now deleted the STEL for this substance. OSHA has carefullyreviewed the health evidence for a STEL for this substance and has determined,in accordance with the Agency's policy (see Section VI.C.17 of this preamble),that it is appropriate not to include a short-term limit in the final rule.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a PEL of 0.2 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hourTWA, with a skin notation; these limits for chlorpyrifos will protect workersagainst the significant risk of cholinesterase inhibition caused by exposureto this previously unregulated substance. The skin notation is includedin the final rule to prevent the systemic effects that have been demonstratedto occur in humans dermally exposed to chlorpyrifos. OSHA finds that thecholinesterase inhibition and systemic effects associated with exposureto chlorpyrifos constitute material impairments of health.<ITAG tagnum="71">CRUFOMATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 299-86-5; Chemical Formula: C<T2>12</T2>H<T2>19</T2>C1NO<T2>3</T2>P</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1103</ITAG>OSHA had no former limit for crufomate. The ACGIH has a TWA-TLV of 5 mg/m\3\and a STEL of 20 mg/m\3\ for this substance. The proposed PELs were 5 mg/m\3\as an 8-hour TWA and 20 mg/m\3\ as a 15-minute STEL, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47,Table N1) concurs. The final rule establishes this 8-hour TWA limit butdoes not establish a STEL for crufomate. Pure crufomate exists as crystals,and commercial crufomate is a yellow oil.Crufomate actively inhibits both plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase.A study in humans showed that ingestion of 200 mg of crufomate daily forseven days caused no apparent cholinesterase inhibition in the subjectsof this controlled study; however, rats and dogs receiving higher doses(5 mg/kg/day) for two years did show this effect (McCollister, Olson, Roweet al. 1968/Ex. 1-350).The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) testified at the hearingthat, in the AIHA's opinion, OSHA should delete any STELs that the ACGIHhas either deleted or indicated that it intends to delete (Ex. 8-16, Tr.p. 3-307). OSHA agrees that such limits should be reevaluated on the basisof current health information (see the discussion in Section VI.C.17);after reviewing the evidence of crufomate's toxicity in short-term exposures,OSHA has determined that it is not appropriate to include a STEL for thissubstance in the final rule.Because cholinesterase inhibition is a very sensitive indicator of exposure,OSHA concludes that the final rule's 8-hour TWA limit of 5 mg/m\3\ is neededto provide an appropriate margin of safety below the ingestion NOEL of200 mg/day for humans, which corresponds approximately to an 8-hour inhalationexposure of 20 mg/m\3\. The Agency finds that this PEL will protect workersfrom the significant risk of material health impairment in the form ofcholinesterase inhibition, which was possible at the previously uncontrolledlevels.<ITAG tagnum="71">CYANAMIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 420-04-2; Chemical Formula: H<T2>2</T2>NC=N</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1104</ITAG>Previously, OSHA had no limit for cyanamide. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of2 mg/m\3\. The proposed PEL for cyanamide was 2 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA;NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs that this limit is appropriate. An 8-hourPEL of 2 mg/m\3\ is established in the final rule. Undiluted cyanamideis a deliquescent, crystalline solid.The average oral LD<T2>50</T2> for cyanamide in rats is 125 (85 to 180) mg/kg, and cyanamidehas been observed to be very irritating and caustic to the skin (AmericanCyanamide Company Product Information Bulletin, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 152). The dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 590 mg/kg (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials,</T3> 7th ed., Sax andLewis 1989, p. 891). Irritation occurred in the form of primary skin irritationand, following instillation into the eye, slight irritation of the conjunctivalsac (American Cyanamide Company Product Information Bulletin, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3. p. 152).When cyanamide is ingested or inhaled by a person who has also consumedan alcoholic beverage, the person experiences vasodilation of the faceand neck, tachycardia, tachypnea, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension. Thissyndrome is referred to as the Antabuse effect. Study of cyanamide's Antabuse-likeeffects indicate that the effect is about one-half that of an equivalentdose of tetraethylthiuram disulfide (Antabuse) and one-sixth that of tetramethylthiuram disulfide (Hald, Jacobsen, and Larsen 1952/Ex. 1-905).  OSHA received comments on cyanamide from the American Cyanamid Company(Exs. 8-76, 3-961, and 94). Linda Dulak, Toxicology Program Manager forAmerican Cyanamid, argued that the final rule should not promulgate limitsfor substances for which there are no analytical methods (Ex. 3-961, p.13). According to Dr. Dulak: <ITAG tagnum="21">Without an analytical limit, the employer cannot determine whetheremployee exposures are being maintained below those limits * * * (Ex. 3-961,p. 13). </ITAG>OSHA notes, however, that Dr. Dulak later stated (Tr. XI, p. 75) that AmericanCyanamid measures the airborne cyanamide level in their plants by samplingfor calcium cyanamide. However, Dr. Dulak was unsure whether this methodis applicable to hydrogen cyanamide. OSHA notes that a method for the samplingand analysis of cyanamide has been submitted to the docket.  According to Dr. Dulak (Ex. 3-961), OSHA also has not evaluated the technologicaland economic feasibility of the 2-mg/m\3\ limit for cyanamide. However,OSHA notes that American Cyanamid's representatives testified at the hearing(Tr. XI, p. 76) that, although the company has no internal standard forcyanamide, it controls airborne cyanamide exposures by measuring and controllingairborne levels of calcium cyanamide. According to Dr. Dulak, her companyhas had ``no problems'' controlling cyanamide exposures (Tr. XI, p. 76). Dr. Dulak's third point is that there is no health basis for setting aninhalation limit for cyanamide (Ex. 3-961, p. 13). OSHA does not agreewith this view and finds the evidence of cyanamide's irritant propertiessufficient to warrant the establishment of an 8-hour TWA limit. Sax andLewis (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials</T3>, 7th ed., 1989, p.981) note that this substance is a severe eye irritant, a moderately toxicsubstance by skin contact, and a poison by ingestion, inhalation, and intraperitonealinjection. The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 152) set its limit, which is thesame as the final rule's PEL, on the basis of cyanamide's relative potentialto cause irritation when compared with other irritants (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 152). Thus, OSHA finds the final rule's PEL both appropriate andprotective.  In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 2 mg/m\3\TWA for cyanamide. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect againstthe significant risks or irritation and of the Antabuse syndrome in individualswho have ingested alcohol. The Agency has determined that this limit willsubstantially reduce these significant risks, which constitute materialhealth impairments.  <ITAG tagnum="71">DICROTOPHOS (BIDRIN)  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 141-66-2; Chemical Formula C<T2>8</T2>H<T2>16</T2>NO<T2>5</T2>P  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1131 </ITAG>Previously, OSHA had no limit for dicrotophos; the ACGIH has a TLV of 0.25mg/m\3\ TWA, with a skin notation, for this brown liquid with a mild esterodor. The proposed PEL was 0.25 mg/m\3\, with a skin notation; NIOSH (Ex.8-47, Table N1) concurs that this limit is appropriate. The final ruleestablishes an 8-hour TWA of 0.25 mg/m\3\ and a skin notation.  Dicrotophos is a cholinesterase inhibitor (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 193).The acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is reported as 22 mg/kg, and the percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 224 mg/kg (Stanford Research Institute 1962,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 193). Another study reports the oralLD<T2>50</T2> in rats as 16 to 21 mg/kg and the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in the same species as 42 mg/kg (Gaines 1969/Ex. 1-320). Two-yearfeeding studies in rats given 0, 1, 10, or 100 ppm dicrotophos showed nodetectable effects at the 1-ppm concentration. At the higher concentrations,decreased body weights (as compared with those of controls) and cholinesteraseinhibition were observed (Woodard Research Corporation 1967, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 193). Dietary studies in dogs showed both plasmaand erythrocyte cholinesterase inhibition at a 16-ppm concentration, butno significant ill effects at concentrations of 0, 0.16, or 1.6 ppm (WoodardResearch Corporation 1967, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 193). Studiesof vapor inhalation in male rats have shown that transient illness occurredafter a one-hour exposure to 910 mg/m\3\ of technical dicrotophos, andto 2620 mg/m\3\ or 2120 mg/m\3\ of 38-percent dicrotophos (Kettering Laboratories1965, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3). Dicrotophos does not cause demyelinizationin chickens (Tunstall Laboratory 1965 and Kettering Laboratory 1963, bothas cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 193), and it is metabolized in a fashionsimilar to mono-microtophos (Menzer and Casida 1965/Ex. 1-986). Only NIOSHcommented on dicrotophos.  The proposed PEL was based on the data described above and, in part, byanalogy with other cholinesterase-inhibiting substances. In the final rule,OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA permissible exposure limit of 0.25 mg/m\3\,with a skin notation, for dicrotophos. The Agency concludes that this limitwill protect workers from the material impairments of health, such as cholinesteraseinhibition, potentially associated with inhalation, ingestion, and dermalexposure to this substance at the levels formerly permitted by the absenceof a limit. OSHA has determined that these limits will substantially reducethis significant risk.  <ITAG tagnum="71">DIMETHYLANILINE  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 121-69-7; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>N(CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1143 </ITAG>OSHA's former permissible exposure limit for dimethylaniline was 5 ppmas an 8-hour TWA, with a skin notation. The ACGIH has an 8-hour TWA limitof 5 ppm, with a 15-minute STEL of 10 ppm and a skin notation. OSHA proposedto retain its 8-hour TWA PEL of 5 ppm with a skin notation and to add aSTEL of 10 ppm, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with these limits.The 5-ppm 8-hour TWA and skin notation are retained in the final rule,and the 10-ppm STEL is established. Dimethylaniline is a yellow to brown,oily liquid.  One of the major toxic effects of dimethylaniline exposure is methemoglobinemia,although authorities disagree concerning the level at which humans cantolerate exposure to this substance (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 207).   Hamblin (1963a/Ex. 1-1084) reported that dimethylaniline is quantitativelyless toxic than aniline. Dogs administered a single oral dose of 50 mg/kgexhibited methemoglobinemia, and absorption of dimethylaniline throughthe skin can increase the overall exposure (Hamblin 1963/Ex. 1-1085). Thedermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits is 1770 mg/kg (<T3>Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials</T3>, 7th ed., Sax andLewis 1989, p. 1360). Mayer (1930/Ex. 1-973) reported that dimethylaniline'snecrotic potential was markedly lower than that of aniline, which has aTLV-TWA of 2 ppm. However, von Oettingen (1941/Ex. 1-874) stated that dimethylanilinehas a greater depressant effect on the nervous system than does aniline. The literature on industrial experience with dimethylaniline is limited.Hamilton (1919/Ex. 1-741) reported collapse, prolonged unconsciousness,visual disturbances, and intense abdominal pain following the severe exposureof two workers. Only NIOSH commented on dimethylaniline.  In the final rule, the Agency is retaining the 8-hour TWA PEL of 5 ppmand a skin notation for dimethylaniline; a STEL of 10 ppm is also beingpromulgated. OSHA finds that the STEL is necessary to afford protectionfrom the CNS depression that follows acute exposures. OSHA concludes thatthese limits, taken together, will provide workers with protection fromthe significant risks of skin absorption, methemoglobinemia, and neuropathiceffects associated with exposure to this substance; the Agency finds thatthese effects clearly constitute material health impairments.  <ITAG tagnum="71">DIOXATHION (DELNAV)  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 78-34-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>12</T2>H<T2>26</T2>O<T2>6</T2>P<T2>2</T2>S<T2>4</T2>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1146 </ITAG>OSHA formerly had no permissible exposure limit for dioxathion. The ACGIHhas a limit of 0.2 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA, with a skin notation. Theproposed PEL was 0.2 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA, with a skin notation, andNIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs with this limit, which is establishedin the final rule. Dioxathion is a nonvolatile, very stable, dark amberliquid.  The pesticide, dioxathion, contains both the cis- and trans-isomers of2,3-p-dioxanedithiol; the cis-isomer is approximately four times as acutelytoxic as the trans-isomer (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 219). The oral LD<T2>50</T2> values reported for rats range from 23 to 118 mg/kg (with mostvalues in the 23- to 64-mg/kg portion of the range); in dogs, oral LD<T2>50</T2>s range from 10 to 40 mg/kg. The LC<T2>50</T2> in rats is 1398 mg/m\3\; in mice, it is 340 mg/m\3\ (Hercules,Inc. 1973, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 219). The percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2>s in rats and rabbits are reported to be 63 and 85 mg/kg, respectively(NIOSH 1983b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 219). Instillation of0.1 ml dioxathion into the rabbit eye produces mild, transient conjunctivitisbut no corneal damage (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 219).  In subacute oral toxicity studies, the no-effect dose level in rats wasreported to be 0.22 mg/kg/day; in dogs, a no-effect level of between 0.075and 0.25 mg/kg/day was indicated (Frawley, Weir, Tusing et al. 1963/Ex.1-317). The no-effect level in multigenerational studies of reproductiveeffects in rats was reported to be 10 ppm (Kennedy, Frawley, and Calandra1973/Ex. 1-340).  Human volunteers who ingested 0.075mg/kg/day of dioxathion had no symptomsrelated to plasma or blood cholinesterase activity, while those ingesting0.15 mg/kg/day exhibited a slight decrease in plasma cholinesterase activity(Frawley, Weir, Tusing et al. 1963/Ex. 1-317). The World Health Organizationhas estimated an acceptable daily intake for man of 0.0015 mg dioxathion/kg(WHO 1967, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 219). Only NIOSH commentedon this substance.  In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.2 mg/m\3\for dioxathion; the Agency is also establishing a skin notation for thissubstance. OSHA concludes that these limits will protect workers againstthe significant risk of metabolic effects associated with inhalation andoral exposure and with dermal penetration of this substance, which wasformerly not regulated by OSHA. The Agency has determined that these limitswill substantially reduce these significant risks; OSHA finds that thecholinesterase inhibition caused by exposure to dioxathion constitutesa material impairment of health.  <ITAG tagnum="71">DISULFIRAM</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"> CAS: 97-77-8; Chemical Formula: C<T2>10</T2>H<T2>20</T2>N<T2>2</T2>S<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1151</ITAG>OSHA had no former limit for disulfiram. The ACGIH recommends a limit of2 mg/m3 TWA for this crystalline solid. The proposed PEL was 2 mg/m3 asan 8-hour TWA; NIOSH concurs with this limit (Ex. 8-47, Table N1), whichis established by the final rule.Disulfiram's LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is reported as 8.6 g/kg (Windholz 1983e, pp. 491-492,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 225), and the oral LD<T2>50</T2> for rabbits is reported to be 2.05 g/kg (Brieger 1947/Ex. 1-717).The compound is highly toxic when injected intraperitoneally, with an LD<T2>50</T2> of 75 mg/kg for mice (National Technical Information Service,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 225). The effects of high-dose ingestioninclude degenerative changes in the liver and kidneys. Very high dosescan cause leukopenia and marked hypoplasia or aplasia of the bone marrow;in the most seriously afflicted animals, the blood urea nitrogen sometimesincreased and the thymol turbidity test was positive (Brieger 1947/Ex.1-717).Adverse health effects occur in humans consuming alcohol and simultaneouslyexposed to disulfiram. This represents a significant concern since disulfiram,under the trade name Antabuse, is used as a medication in the treatmentof chronic alcoholism. For individuals who drink alcohol and are exposedto disulfiram, the symptoms of exposure are facial vasodilation, tachycardia,tachypnea, nausea, vomiting, pallor, and hypotension. High doses of disulfiramcan induce convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction,and the compound has also been associated with polyneuropathy, peripheralneuritis, and skin eruptions (<T3>Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties</T3> 1968, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 225). In industry, there have been reports of minimalskin irritation (Mastromatteo 1973, as cited in ACGIH 1986, p. 225) andof optic neuritis (Norton and Walsh 1972/Ex. 1-877). NIOSH submitted theonly comment on this substance.OSHA is establishing a PEL of 2 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA for disulfiram.The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workers against the significantrisk of Antabuse-like effects associated with exposure to airborne concentrationsof disulfiram in combination with alcohol consumption.

Pure ethion is an odorless and colorless liquid; however, technical-gradeethion has a very disagreeable odor.Ethion is an insecticide that is used in a variety of forms, including25-percent wettable powder, 2-, 3-, and 4-percent dust, 5-percent granules,and in several oil solutions and combinations with other chemicals. Asa result, the acute toxicity values reported vary considerably.NIOSH (1974d, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 236) reports an oral LD<T2>50</T2>s in rats of 13 mg/kg. Other reported values for oral LD<T2>50</T2>s in rats include 65 mg/kg, 96 mg/kg, and 208 mg/kg (<T3>Farm Chemicals Handbook</T3> 1974/Ex. 1-1147a; Association of AmericanPesticide Control Officials, Inc. 1969, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 236; Hayes 1963/Ex. 1-982). Studies with 95 percent technical ethionreport oral LD<T2>50</T2>s of 87.4 andplusmin; 0.16 mg/kg for albino rats and 24.4 mg/kgfor female rats (Niagara Chemical Division, FMC Corp., as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 236). Inhalation studies report LC<T2>50</T2> values of 710 mg/m3 for female rats exposed to 25-percent wettablepowder dust for one hour, and 7200 mg/m3 for male rats similarly exposed.Dermal exposure studies, employing technical ethion, report a median acutedermal lethal dose in rabbits of 915 mg/kg, demonstrating enthion's abilityto penetrate skin; instillation of 0.05 ml ethion in the rabbit eye isimmediately irritating but does not cause corneal scarring (Niagara ChemicalDivision, FMC Corp., as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 236). Dietary studiesof rats fed 600, 1000, or 1500 ppm reported complete cholinesterase inhibition;300 ppm in the diet produced marked cholinesterase inhibition (Associationof American Pesticide Control Officials, Inc. 1969, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 236).Ethion poisonings have been reported in workers harvesting grapes and peaches(State of California Department of Industrial Relations, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 236). Only NIOSH commented on ethion.OSHA is establishing a PEL of 0.4 mg/m3 for ethion as an 8-hour TWA, witha skin notation. The Agency concludes that these limits will protect exposedworkers from the significant risks of organophosphate poisoning and cholinesteraseinhibition formerly permitted by the absence of any OSHA limit. The Agencynotes this substance's potential for dermal absorption in laboratory animalsand is establishing a skin notation to protect against the risk of systemictoxicity by this route of exposure.

Fenamiphosis a tan-colored, waxy solid.Fenamiphos is a cholinesterase inhibitor that produces both central andperipheral cholinergic reactions (WHO 1975, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 265). The acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> values reported for fenamiphos are 2 to 19 mg/kg in rats, 22mg/kg in mice, 56 to 100 mg/kg in guinea pigs, 10 to 17 mg/kg in rabbits,and approximately 10 mg/kg in cats and dogs. Acute dermal LD<T2>50</T2> values are 72 to 154 mg/kg in rats and 178 to 225 mg/kg inrabbits. One- and four-hour exposures of rats to fenamiphos aerosols resultedin LC<T2>50</T2> values of 110 to 175 mg/m3 and 91 to 100 mg/m3, respectively.Rabbits exhibited no dermal or eye irritation (WHO 1975 and Loeser andKimmerle 1971, both as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 265).Rats exposed to fenamiphos aerosol at concentrations of 0.03, 0.25, or3.5 mg/m3 of air for three weeks exhibited no symptoms. At 3.5 mg/m3, ratsshowed significant depression of plasma cholinesterase; 0.25 mg/m3 wasthe highest no-effect concentration observed (Kimmerle 1982c, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 265). Two-year feeding studies of dogs (at levelsof 0.5, 1.0, and 10 ppm) and rats (at levels of 3, 10, and 30 ppm) revealedno treatment-related toxic or oncogenic effects or tissue changes at adietary level of 10 ppm; no-observed-effect levels were 3 ppm for the ratand 1 ppm for the dog (WHO 1975, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 265).Studies of rabbits and rats showed no embryotoxic or teratogenic effects,and results of a three-generation study in rats showed that fenamiphoshad no effect on reproduction (WHO 1975, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 265). Studies of mice have also shown no mutagenic effects, and a studyof chickens demonstrated no delayed neurotoxic efforts (WHO 1975 and Loeserand Kimmerle 1971, both as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 265). Fenamiphosis metabolized rapidly to sulfoxide and sulfone derivatives and is excretedprimarily in the urine, as demonstrated in absorption tests of the skinand the digestive and respiratory tracts of rats and cows (Waggoner andKhasawinah 1974/Ex. 1-579).There are no reports of human poisonings caused by exposure to fenamiphos,and no quantitative data are available relating adverse health effectsto measurable airborne concentrations of fenamiphos. NIOSH submitted theonly comment on fenamiphos.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a PEL for this substance of 0.1mg/m3 TWA to protect against the significant risk of anticholinesteraseeffects presented by exposure to this substance at the levels formerlypermitted by the absence of an OSHA limit.

The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA of 2.5mg/m3 for this white crystalline solid with a slightly sulfurous odor.The proposed PEL for methomyl was 2.5 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA; NIOSH (Ex.8-47, Table N1) concurs, and the final rule establishes this limit.Methomyl is a cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticide. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats is reported to be between 25 and 40 mg/kg (Dashielland Kennedy 1984/Ex. 1-548). Studies of dermal effects have reported noappreciable irritation or sensitization in guinea pigs. Instillation ofa 10-percent solution of methomyl in propylene glycol or of the dry materialinto rabbit eyes caused mild conjunctivitis without corneal injury. However,marked pupillary constriction, a health effect produced commonly by cholinesteraseinhibitors, was observed (E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co., Inc., as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 363). The LC<T2>50</T2> of unformulated methomyl as mist is 0.3 mg/L at four-hour exposures;the lethal concentration in rats exposed to a 90-percent water-solubleformulation with a particle size of less than 10 microns was approximately0.45 mg/L.Inhalation studies have reported no fatalities resulting from four-hourexposures to the saturated vapor. There is no clinical evidence of cumulativetoxicity resulting from 10 doses of 5.1 mg/kg/day over a 14-day period(Harvey, Jelinek, and Sherman 1973/Ex. 1-486). Methomyl is rapidly metabolizedand excreted in the urine, and cholinesterase inhibition is thus quicklyreversed. In dogs, a dose of 20 mg/kg (one-half the lethal dose) producedsymptoms of intoxication and cholinesterase inhibition that disappearedwithin two to four hours after cessation of exposure (E.I. du Pont de Nemoursand Co., Inc. as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 363). No depression ofcholinesterase activity could be detected in rats fed at levels of 0. 200,400, or 800 ppm methomyl for 79 days. In dogs, 90-day and two-year feedingstudies showed no effects at 0, 50, 100, or 400 ppm; however, animals fedat 1000 ppm did demonstrate toxicity. Similar studies of rats have shownkidney, liver, and spleen damage at higher feeding levels, but the no-effectlevel for both rats and dogs has been reported to be 100 ppm (Kaplan andSherman 1977/Ex. 1-337). Only NIOSH submitted comments on methomyl.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a PEL of 2.5 mg/m3 (8-hour TWA)for methomyl. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect exposedworkers against the risk of cholinesterase inhibition to which they couldformerly have been exposed in the absence of any OSHA limit. The Agencyhas determined that this limit will substantially reduce the significantrisk of cholinergic effects, which constitute material impairments of health.<ITAG tagnum="71">MONOMETHYLANILINE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 100-61-8; Chemical Formula: C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>NH(CH<T2>3</T2>) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

OSHA proposedto reduce the 8-hour TWA PEL to 0.5 ppm and to retain the skin notation;NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs, and these limits are established bythe final rule. Monomethylaniline is a colorless liquid that turns reddish-brownafter standing. Treon, Deichmann, Sigmon, and associates (1949/Ex. 1-676) found that monomethylanilineapplied to the skin of laboratory animals resulted in systemic poisoning,and that the oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits was 280 mg/kg. A later study by Treon and associates(1950/Ex. 1-533) showed that guinea pigs, rabbits, and rats died from 130or fewer seven-hour exposures to 7.6 ppm monomethylaniline. In the samestudy, a monkey survived the same number and length of exposures at 2.4ppm, and a dog survived 50 exposures at 86 ppm. Exposed animals later developedblood changes, including methemoglobinemia and Heinz bodies (Treon, Sigmon,Wright et al. 1950/Ex. 1-533). NIOSH was the only commenter to the recordon monomethylaniline. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 0.5-ppm TWA limit, with a skinnotation, for this substance. The Agency concludes that these limits willprotect workers from the significant risk of metabolic and blood effects,such as methemoglobinemia, potentially associated with exposure to monomethylaniline.The skin notation will protect workers from the risk of systemic poisoningposed by the skin absorption of this substance. OSHA finds that the methemoglobinemiaand skin irritation associated with exposure to monomethylaniline exposureconstitute material health impairments. <ITAG tagnum="71">p-NITROCHLOROBENZENE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 100-00-5; Chemical Formula: NO<T2>2</T2>C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>C1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1288</ITAG>OSHA formerly had an 8-hour TWA limit of 1 mg/m3, with a skin notation,for p-nitrochlorobenzene (PNCB). The ACGIH's new TLV-TWA of 0.6 mg/m3 (0.1ppm), with a skin notation for this substance was recently reduced froma TLV-TWA of 3 mg/m3 (0.5 ppm). The Agency proposed to retain its limitand the skin notation, and the final rule includes these limits. para-Nitrochlorobenzenetakes the form of yellow crystals and has a sweet odor. The primary hazards associated with exposure to PNCB include systemic toxicityto the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and kidneys, as well as methemoglobinemiaand DNA damage. The Monsanto Company (1977, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 432.2) reported an oral LD<T2>50</T2> in rats of 530 mg/kg and a dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in rabbits of greater than 3040 mg/kg; PNCB was absorbed throughrabbit skin to produce methemoglobinemia (Kubota 1960, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 432.2), although application to the skin or eyes did notproduce irritation (Monsanto Company 1977, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 432.2). Rusakov, Korotkova, and Bikbulatov (1973/Ex. 1-660) describedthe development of sensitization in guinea pigs after dermal applicationof PNCB. A four-hour inhalation exposure of rats (heads only) showed that the lethalconcentration was approximately 16.1 mg/L (E.I. du Pont de Nemours andamp;Co., Inc. 1981, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 432.2). Head-only exposuresat 0.05, 0.29, or 0.64 mg/L PNCB for six hours/day, five days/week fortwo weeks resulted in spleen-weight increases and blood effects in allgroups. In addition, there were dose-related effects in blood methemoglobinlevels (i.e., decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell countvalues). Microscopic changes in the spleen, bone marrow, and kidneys wereseen in the two higher-dose groups, and both pathological degenerationof the seminiferous tubules and abnormal epididymal sperm contents werealso observed in these groups (E.I. du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co., Inc.1984, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 432.2). The Monsanto Company (1981, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 432.2) reportedthat a 90-day gavage administration of PNCB at daily doses of 0.3, 10,or 30 mg/kg to male and female rats produced hemolytic effects and spleenchanges at all levels, kidney and liver effects at mid- to high-level doses,and hyperplasia of bone marrow and testicular atrophy at the highest dose(30 mg/kg/day). In 1985, Monsanto reported the results of another gavagestudy in rats. After two years of PNCB feeding at 0.1, 0.7, or 5.0 mg/kg/day,animals in the mid- and high-dose groups exhibited hemolytic effects; inaddition, mid- and high-dose groups showed microscopic spleen, kidney,and liver changes and, at the highest dose, bone marrow hyperplasia andtesticular atrophy (Monsanto Company 1985, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 432.2).Rats fed PNCB at doses of 0, 0.1, 0.7, or 5 mg/kg/day for up to two yearsshowed methemoglobinemia at the two highest levels, and animals in the5-mg/kg/day group had indications of anemia and pigment accumulation inspleen cells. No treatment-related increase in tumors was observed (MonsantoCompany 1985, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 432.2). In a dietary cancerbioassay, rats and mice were given PNCB at unspecified levels for two years(Weisberger, Russfield, Homburger et al. 1978/Ex. 1-535). Only mice wereaffected, with mice of both sexes showing an increase in vascular tumorsat the highest dose and male mice showing an increase in liver tumors atthe lowest dose (Weisberger, Russfield, Homburger et al. 1978/Ex. 1-535).Maternal toxicity was seen in rats given PNCB by gavage at doses of 15and 45 mg/kg/day on days nine through 16 of gestation; at the 45-mg/kglevel, fetotoxicity and teratogenicity were also observed (Nair, Johannsen,and Schroeder 1985/Ex. 1-752). At 15 mg/kg, maternal toxicity but no fetotoxicityor teratogenic effects occurred; at the lowest dose, the only effect wasa small increase in maternal spleen weight. A two-generation reproductivestudy resulted in a reduced mating index in rats given 0.7 or 5.0 mg/kg/day(Monsanto Company 1984, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 432.2). Positiveresponses were observed in a mutation assay of L5178Y TK mouse lymphomacells (both with and without metabolic activation) and in a microbial assayof <T3>Salmonella </T3>strain TA 1535 (in the absence of metabolic activation);however, no evidence of mutagenicity was noted in assays of three other<T3>Salmonella </T3>strains or in assays of Chinese hamster ovary cells,rat hepatocyte primary culture/DNA repair, or rat bone marrow cell clastogenesis(Monsanto Company 1980-1984, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 432.2).PNCB produced DNA damage in the liver, kidney, and brain cells of ratsafter a single intraperitoneal dose of 30 to 1000 mg/kg (Cesarone, Bolognesi,and Santi 1983/Ex. 1-542) and in cultured hepatocytes at 1.5 hours aftera three-hour treatment (Cesarone, Fugassa, Galle et al. 1984/Ex. 1-541).p-Nitrochlorobenzene may be absorbed through the lungs and skin in humansto produce methemoglobinemia. Reports of industrial exposures indicatethat overexposure causes cyanosis, weakness, and headache (Saita and Moreo1958/Ex. 1-930; Renshaw and Ashcroft 1926/Ex. 1-522). In a study of workmenexposed to average concentrations of PNCB at 55, 125, or 143 ppm and toa 23-ppm concentration of a PNCB-nitrophenol mixture, the authors concludedthat the mixed exposure did not produce chronic intoxication, but did causeincreased methemoglobin, the appearance of Heinz bodies, headache, vertigo,and occasional eczema; these effects could not be attributed definitelyeither to skin absorption or to the level of PNCB in the mixture (PacseandCx.174;1ri,Magos, and Batskor 1958/Ex. 1-521). No data are reported for the p-nitrochlorobenzeneexposures only (PacseandCx.174;1ri, Magos, and Batskor 1958/Ex. 1-521).Only NIOSH commented on p-nitrochlorobenzene. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6Band Tr. III, pp. 97-98) notes that this substance is a potential occupationalcarcinogen and that the risk remaining at the PEL is substantial; NIOSHtherefore regards p-nitrochlorobenzene as a candidate for a full section6(b) rulemaking. OSHA is aware both of the recent toxicological data onthis substance and of the ACGIH's recent lowering of the TLV to 0.6 mg/m3.OSHA will carefully monitor the literature on PNCB and will revise thePEL in the future if such action is warranted.In the final rule, OSHA is retaining its former 8-hour TWA limit of 1 mg/m3for p-nitrochlorobenzene, with a skin notation. The Agency concludes thatthese limits are necessary to protect workers from the significant risksof methemoglobinemia and changes in the spleen, liver, and kidney possibleat higher exposure levels. OSHA is retaining the skin notation becausedermal absorption of PNCB has been shown to cause systemic effects in humansand animals. The Agency finds that methemoglobinemia and spleen, kidney,and liver damage constitute material impairments of health.<ITAG tagnum="71">PHORATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 298-02-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>7</T2>H<T2>17</T2>O<T2>2</T2>PS<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1319</ITAG>Previously, OSHA had no limit for phorate. The ACGIH has limits of 0.05mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA and 0.2 mg/m3 as a STEL for phorate, with a skinnotation. The proposed PELs were 0.05 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA PEL, witha STEL of 0.2 mg/m3 and a skin notation; NIOSH concurs with these limits(Ex. 8-47, Table N1), which are established in the final rule. Phorateis an organophosphorus cholinesterase inhibitor that takes the form ofa clear liquid and is used as an insecticide.Phorate is a highly toxic compound in animals. Rats exposed to daily dosesof phorate showed effects above 0.15 mg/kg/day but no effects below thislevel. The no-effect level in dogs is between 0.01 and 0.05 mg/kg/day (Gaines1969/Ex. 1-320). The dermal LD<T2>50</T2> in male rats is 6.2 mg/kg and, for female rats, 25 mg/kg.The final rule's limits of 0.05 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA, supplemented bya STEL of 0.2 mg/m3 and a skin notation, are based on calculations thatthe no-effect level in humans would lie in the range between 0.21 and 0.7mg/day, and that use of an appropriate safety factor would suggest an 8-hourlimit of 0.05 mg/m3, with a STEL of 0.2 mg/m3, to ensure against excursionsgreatly in excess of the TWA limit. OSHA received no comments on phorateexcept those from NIOSH.OSHA finds that these limits will protect workers exposed to phorate againstcholinesterase inhibition and its associated effects, which include respiratorysymptoms, nausea, confusion, and vomiting. The Agency concludes that, inthe absence of any OSHA limit, phorate-exposed employees were formerlyat significant risk of experiencing such effects and that establishinga PEL, STEL, and skin notation will substantially reduce these risks. OSHAfinds that cholinesterase inhibition and its symptoms clearly constitutematerial impairments of health.<ITAG tagnum="71">PROPOXUR</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 114-26-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>11</T2>H<T2>15</T2>NO<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1337</ITAG>OSHA had no former limit for propoxur. The ACGIH has established an 8-hourTLV-TWA of 0.5 mg/m3 for this white, odorless, crystalline compound. Theproposed PEL was 0.5 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1)concurs with this limit, and the final rule establishes it.The oral LD<T2>50</T2>s in male and female rats are 83 and 86 mg/kg, respectively;for both sexes, the dermal LD<T2>50</T2> is greater than 2400 mg/kg (Gaines 1969/Ex. 1-320). Dietarystudies in rats at levels of 7.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days or at 800 ppm forthree months produced no adverse effect (Association of American PesticideControl Officials, Inc. 1966/Ex. 1-1011). Rats were exposed to propoxurconcentrations of 5, 7, 18.7, or 31.7 mg/m3 six hours/day, five days/weekfor 12 weeks; animals in the high-dose group showed depressed red bloodcell and brain cholinesterase levels, and plasma cholinesterase was depressedby as much as 20 to 30 percent (Association of American Pesticide ControlOfficials, Inc. 1966/Ex. 1-1011).In humans, a few cases of mild propoxur poisoning have been reported amongsprayers of this insecticide and among residents of propoxur-treated homes(Vandekar, Hedayat, Plestina, and Ahmady 1968/Ex. 1-679). In a study ofhuman volunteers, a single oral dose of 1.5 mg/kg propoxur caused a depressionin red blood cell cholinesterase and gastrointestinal symptoms that disappearedtwo hours after ingestion. Oral doses of 0.75 to 1.0 mg/kg produced nosymptoms but did depress erythrocyte cholinesterase (Vandekar, Plestina,and Wilhelm 1971/Ex. 1-680). The only comment on this substance was submittedby NIOSH.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 0.5 mg/m3 forpropoxur. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workers againstthe significant risk of cholinesterase inhibition associated with exposureto this substance at the levels formerly permitted by the absence of anyOSHA limit. OSHA finds that cholinesterase inhibition is a material healthimpairment.<ITAG tagnum="71">RONNEL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 299-84-3; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>O)<T2>2</T2>PSOC<T2>6</T2>H<T2>2</T2>Cl<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PEL was10 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs with thislimit, and it is established in the final rule.Ronnel is an indirect cholinesterase inhibitor that affects the blood plasmarather than the red cell acetylcholinesterase (Plapp and Casida 1958a/Ex.1-657). The acute oral LD<T2>50</T2> for rats is reported as 1250 and 2630 mg/kg for males and females,respectively. The oral LD<T2>50</T2> in dogs is greater than 500 mg/kg (McCollister, Oyen, and Rowe1959/Ex. 1-594). Two-year dietary studies of rats fed up to 50 mg/kg/dayshowed no effect on growth rate, food consumption, survival, or hematopoesis(McCollister, Oyen, and Rowe 1959/Ex. 1-594). In a study by Gladenko andStuk (1972, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 513), albino rats developedclinical symptoms of motor irritation, tremor, increased auditory and tactilesensitivity, lacrimation, and salivation within two weeks of exposure atlevels between 164 and 328 mg/kg; some animals died during the latter partof the study. At exposures below 16.4 mg/kg, no ill effects were observed(Gladenko and Stuk 1972, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 513). A two-yearfeeding study in dogs exposed at 10 mg/kg showed no ill effects exceptcholinesterase depletion (Worden, Noel, and Mawdesley-Thomas 1972/Ex. 1-583).Patch tests of 50 human subjects showed that ronnel has no skin-sensitizingpotential (McCollister, Oyen, and Rowe 1959/Ex. 1-594). Only NIOSH submittedcomments on this substance.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 10 mg/m3for ronnel. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workers againstthe significant risk of cholinergic effects associated with exposure tothis substance. OSHA has determined that this limit will substantiallyreduce this significant risk, and that cholinesterase inhibition constitutesa material health impairment.<ITAG tagnum="71">SULPROFOS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 35400-43-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>12</T2>H<T2>19</T2>O<T2>2</T2>PS<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PEL was 1 mg/m3 as an 8-hourTWA; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with this limit, and OSHA establishesthis limit in the final rule. Sulprofos, also known as the insecticideBolstarR, is a tan liquid.Kimmerle (1982b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 547) conducted an extensiveanimal study on the effects of sulprofos. He reported that the acute toxicityof sulprofos is species-dependent; rats have an oral LD<T2>50</T2> of 100 to 300 mg/kg and mice have an oral LD<T2>50</T2> of 1600 to 1800 mg/kg. The reported dermal LD<T2>50</T2>s are greater than 1000 ml/kg in rats and 800 to 1000 mg/kgin rabbits. In rabbits, sulprofos did not irritate the skin or eyes, andit had no dermal-sensitization effects in guinea pigs. Inhalation studiesshowed no fatalities in rats exposed to aerosol concentrations of up to4130 mg/m3 of sulprofos over a period of four hours. In a three-week inhalationstudy in which rats were exposed to aerosol concentrations of 6, 14, or74 mg/m3, the two highest concentrations produced cholinergic symptoms;no observable effects were seen at the lowest concentration. Two-year feedingstudies by Kimmerle (1982b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 547) indogs, rats, and mice showed that sulprofos concentrations of 150 ppm, 250ppm, or 400 ppm were tolerated by all species, with no sulprofos-relatedtissue changes, signs of toxicity, or oncogenic effects. The overall NOELswere 10 ppm in dogs, 6 ppm in rats, and 2.5 ppm in mice. Kimmerle's ingestionstudies in rats and rabbits dosed at levels of 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day ofsulprofos showed no embryotoxic or teratogenic effects in these animals,and a three-generation diet study in rats also produced no adverse reproductiveeffects. Mutagenic studies reported by the same author in mice were negative.Separate subacute inhalation studies also showed no effects on blood cholinesteraselevels in rats exposed to 6 mg/m3 (Zielhuis and van der Kreek 1979/Ex.1-613). There are no reported cases of poisoning in humans (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 547). NIOSH was the only commenter on sulprofos.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 1 mg/m3for sulprofos. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect workersfrom the significant risk of cholinesterase inhibition, the most sensitiveindicator of exposure to this previously unregulated substance. The Agencyhas determined that this limit will substantially reduce this significantrisk, and that cholinesterase inhibition constitutes a material impairmentof health.<ITAG tagnum="71">TERPHENYLS</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 26140-60-3; Chemical Formula: C<T2>18</T2>H<T2>14</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1384</ITAG>The former OSHA limit for the terphenyls was 1.0 ppm as a ceiling limit.The ACGIH has a 0.5-ppm ceiling limit for these substances. The proposedPEL for the terphenyls was 0.5 ppm as a ceiling; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN1) concurs with, and the final rule establishes, this limit. Terphenylsare colorless or light yellow solids and are used as coolants in nuclearreactors. Commercial preparations contain mixtures of ortho-, meta-, andpara-terphenyls.The terphenyls are primary irritants that cause eye, skin, and respiratorytract irritation. Haley, Detrick, Komesu et al. (1959/Ex. 1-326) reportedthat mixtures of terphenyls caused conjunctival irritation when instilledinto the eyes of rabbits, and damaged guinea pig skin following intracutaneousinjection. Cornish, Bahor, and Ryan (1962/Ex. 1-410) determined LD<T2>50</T2> values of 1900, 2400, and greater than 10,000 mg/kg for theortho-, meta-, and para-terphenyls, respectively. These authors also conducted30-day feeding studies of rats involving doses of 250 or 500 mg/kg/dayof the individual terphenyl isomers. Rats fed ortho-terphenyl showed elevatedliver and kidney weight ratios; rats fed meta-terphenyl displayed elevatedkidney weight ratios only; and rats fed para-terphenyl showed no elevationin liver or kidney weight ratios. Two studies by Petkau and Hoogstraaten(1965/Ex. 1-432) and Young, Petkau, and Hoogstraaten (1969/Ex. 1-459) haveshown that the terphenyls have nephrotoxic effects and cause hepatic damagein rats fed 33 mg/kg/day. Adamson, Bowden, and Wyatt (1969/Ex. 1-293) publisheda study in which rats exposed to terphenyl aerosols for seven hours perday at a concentration of 50 mg/m3 (approximately 5 ppm), for a periodof eight days, developed morphological changes in their pulmonary cellmitochondria; the number of vacuolated mitochondria was directly relatedto duration of exposure.Weeks (1971/Ex. 1-580) and Weeks and Lentle (1970/Ex. 1-682) conducteda clinical survey of 47 workers with ongoing exposure to terphenyl coolantin a nuclear facility. The study represented 122 man-years of occupationalexposure, with durations of exposure ranging from six months to seven years.The airborne concentrations of terphenyl varied, measuring 0.094 mg/m3in general working areas and up to 0.89mg/m3 in areas with organic pipingequipment. The terphenyl coolant was determined to be a primary irritant,even in those workers wearing protective clothing, because skin moistnessincreased dermal sensitivity to the terphenyls (Weeks 1971/Ex. 1-580; Weeksand Lentle 1970/Ex. 1-682). Testa and Masi (1964/Ex. 1-578) reported that,at concentrations above 10 mg/m3 (approximately 1 ppm, the former OSHAceiling limit), workers reported both eye and respiratory irritation.The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA) recommended generallythat OSHA delay rulemaking on a number of substances, including the terphenyls,on the grounds that the MVMA did not have sufficient time to review andevaluate the impacts of this rulemaking (Ex. 3-902). The MVMA did not provideany data or report any problems specific to the health effects or feasibilityof the limit proposed for the terphenyls; instead, the MVMA merely listedthese substances and many others in its submission. In response to theMVMA, OSHA notes that hundreds of commenters were able to provide detailedinformation to OSHA in the time allotted. In addition, no other commentswere received on the subject of the terphenyls.In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a ceiling limit of 0.5 ppm forthe terphenyls. The Agency concludes that this limit will protect exposedworkers against the significant risk of primary irritation of the eyes,skin, and upper respiratory tract and of mitochondrial changes potentiallyassociated with exposure to very low airborne levels of the terphenyls.The Agency has determined that this limit will substantially reduce thesesignificant risks and that primary irritation and metabolic effects constitutematerial health impairments.<ITAG tagnum="71">m-TOLUIDINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 108-44-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>7</T2>H<T2>9</T2>N</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The proposed PEL was 2 ppmas an 8-hour TWA, with a skin notation, and the final rule establishesthese limits. m-Toluidine is a light yellow liquid.When m-toluidine was tested on the eyes and skin of rabbits, moderate tostrong irritation effects resulted (NIOSH 1979b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 589). A mean maximal methemoglobinemia of 60.2 percent was reportedto occur following the intravenous administration of 27 mg m-toluidineper kilogram of body weight in cats (McLean, Starmer, and Thomas 1969/Ex.1-425). Rodent carcinogenicity studies cited by the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 589) were either inconclusive or negative. The effects in humans of exposure to m-toluidine, when it is either absorbedthrough the skin or delivered via inhalation, are hematuria and methemoglobinemia.Exposure to 40 ppm for 60 minutes causes severe poisoning (Goldblatt 1955/Ex.1-417). There are no epidemiological studies of workers exposed only tom-toluidine (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 589). NIOSH does not concur with OSHA's limit (Ex. 8-47, Table N2: Tr. III, p.86) and reports that, although the evidence for the carcinogenicity ofm-toluidine is inconclusive (Weisberger, Russfield, Homburger et al. 1978/Ex.1-535), it is important to remember that this substance is an aromaticamine, like o- and p-toluidine, both of which are carcinogenic. NIOSH commentedthat a lower PEL might be appropriate for this substance. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 2-ppm 8-hour TWA and a skin notationfor this previously unregulated chemical. The Agency concludes that thislimit will protect workers from the significant risk of metabolic effects,such as hematuria and methemoglobinemia, associated with exposure to m-toluidineat the levels formerly permitted in the absence of any OSHA PEL. OSHA findsthat hematuria, methemoglobinemia, and the other metabolic effects associatedwith exposure to m-toluidine constitute material impairments of health.<ITAG tagnum="71">2,4,6-TRINITROTOLUENE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 118-96-7; Chemical Formula: C <T2>7</T2>H <T2>5</T2>N <T2>3</T2>O <T2>6</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH has set a TLV-TWA of 0.5 mg/m3, also with a skin notation, for this chemical. The proposed PEL was 0.5mg/m 3 as an 8-hour TWA, and the final rule establishes this limit; theskin notation is retained. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) agrees that thislimit is appropriate. TNT occurs as yellow, needle-like crystals and isused as an explosive. The ACGIH's limit was selected on the basis of health surveys conductedamong occupationally exposed workers. Fairhall (1957e, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 610) describes dermatitis, cyanosis, gastritis, acuteyellow atrophy of the liver, and aplastic anemia as possible effects ofexposure to TNT. According to Sollman (1957/Ex. 1-991), blood destruction,leucocytosis or leucopenia, and varying degrees of central nervous systemchange (probably resulting from anoxia, peripheral neuritis and muscularpains, cardiac muscular and menstrual irregularities, and urinary and renalirritation) can also occur as a consequence of TNT exposure. TNT has irritantproperties and may cause sneezing, sore throat, or skin irritation (vonOettingen 1941/Ex. 1-874). A study by Goodwin (1972/Ex. 1-556) revealed 36 cases of liver damage ina munitions plant where workers were exposed to a mean air level of 2.38mg/m 3 TNT over a period of 20 years. Another study (Morton, Ranadive,and Hathaway 1976/Ex. 1-566) found elevated levels of liver enzymes in43 TNT shell-packers and loaders who worked where TNT exposures rangedfrom 0.3 to 0.8 mg/m 3 over a period of five months. In 1975, Djerassiand Vitany (Ex. 1-550) published a paper describing hemolytic episodesin three TNT workers with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency;although these workers were from Iraq, where G-6-PDase deficiency has ahigh (25 percent) frequency of occurrence, the study is also of concernfor other workers having a high frequency of G-6-PDase deficiency. NIOSHwas the only commenter to the record on TNT. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 0.5 mg/m 3 for2,4,6-trinitrotoluene; the skin notation is retained. The Agency concludesthat this limit is necessary to protect workers against the significantrisk of liver damage and hemolytic effects potentially associated withexposure to TNT. OSHA has determined that this limit will substantiallyreduce these significant risks and that liver damage and hemolysis constitutematerial health impairments. Conclusions for the Group of Biochemical/Metabolic Toxins For the class of toxic substances having biochemical/metabolic effects,OSHA concludes that occupational exposure presents significant risks. Theeffects associated with exposure to these substances (which inhibit cholinesteraseactivity, interfere with the blood's ability to carry oxygen, and produceAntabuse-like symptoms and signs) range from nausea, bronchoconstriction,cardiac irregularities, neurobehavioral effects, and unconsciousness tocoma and death, depending on the severity of the exposure. OSHA finds thatall of these symptoms and signs constitute material health impairments.Because many of these substances are relatively new on the industrial scene,OSHA previously had no limits for them. This situation meant that, in thepast, occupational exposures to these substances could be essentially uncontrolled.The Agency finds that establishing or revising limits for this group oftoxicants is necessary to reduce these significant occupational risks.<ITAG tagnum="81">14. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of SensitizationEffects </ITAG>Introduction OSHA is establishing limits for eight substances on the basis of theirability to cause pulmonary or skin sensitization. Table C14-1 lists theformer, proposed, and revised OSHA PELs and the CAS and HS numbers forthese substances. For four of these substances, OSHA had no former permissibleexposure limit. For two substances, OSHA has reduced its former 8-hourTWA PEL. In the case of picric acid, OSHA proposed to add a STEL to theformer 8-hour TWA PEL for this substance but has determined in the finalrule that no STEL is necessary. For toluene-2,4-diisocyanate, OSHA's ceilinglimit has been revised to an 8-hour TWA and is supplemented with a STEL.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 1293 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>Description of the Health Effects A sensitization reaction, also known as an allergic reaction, is definedas an adverse response to a chemical following a previous exposure to thatsubstance or to a structurally similar one (Klaasen, Amdur, and Doull 1986/Ex.1-99). A person who suffers an allergic reaction to a chemical is saidto have become sensitized to that substance. Sensitization is the resultof an immune reaction to a substance; although the initial exposure doesnot generate an immediate response, the immune system ``remembers'' thesubstance and reacts strongly at the next encounter. A related phenomenonis cross-sensitization. Cross-sensitization occurs when exposure to onesubstance elicits a sensitization reaction, not only upon subsequent exposureto the same substance, but also upon exposure to a different substance(usually one with a similar chemical structure). The toxic manifestations of sensitization reactions vary in both locationand severity. In humans, common target organs are the skin and the eyes;typical allergic conditions in these organ systems are allergic contactdermatitis and conjunctivitis, respectively. The respiratory system canalso be sensitized; the resulting pathologies include bronchitis and asthma(Dean, Murray, and Ward 1986/Ex. 1-195). These allergic reactions are mediatedby the two immunoglobulins IgD or IgE. The involvement of IgD results indelayed contact dermatitis. In contrast, IgE-mediated reactions cause verysevere and potentially fatal effects, such as acute asthmatic attacks,urticaria, and anaphylactic shock. The unpredictability and potential seriousnessof sensitization reactions demand that exposures to sensitizing substancesbe carefully controlled. Sensitivity to a chemical frequently persists throughout the lifetime ofan individual; in some cases, however, sensitization disappears over time.Sensitization symptoms are not observed after exposure to the sensitizingagent (or to a structurally similar chemical) has been discontinued. Althoughit is possible to treat some allergies, avoidance is considered the bestway, and sometimes the only way, to regain good health. An additional cause for concern about exposure to sensitizing chemicalsis recent evidence that residual respiratory symptoms may continue evenafter exposure is discontinued. For example, in the case of toluene-2,4-diisocyanate(TDI), Weill, Butcher, Dharmarajan et al. (1981/Ex. 1-1188) and Innocenti,Franzinelli, Sartorelli et al. (1981/Ex. 1-180) found that sensitized workersmay exhibit decreased pulmonary function or chronic bronchitis for as longas three and one-half years after cessation of exposure. Dose-Response Relationships and Sensitization Effects Like other toxic effects, allergic reactions are dose-related; that is,in response to larger doses of the substance, increasing numbers of subjectsbecome sensitized and the subsequent reactions become more severe. Thetime course of sensitization for any one individual is unpredictable. Someindividuals are sensitized after only one exposure; others remain resistantto sensitization after a lifetime of exposure. Different people are generallysensitive to different substances, although some substances are more universallyreactive than others, such as the active agent in poison ivy. Various parametersinfluence the likelihood of sensitization by a particular chemical; theseinclude such factors as ``the nature of the chemical, concentration, typeof exposure, genetic susceptibility and nongenetic idiosyncrasies'' (Emmett1986/Ex. 1-226). The sensitization reactions observed in occupational settingsare often the result of dermal or inhalation exposure. For most of the substances in this group, the revised limits have beenset on the basis of health surveys and reports of occupationally exposedpopulations. These studies indicate that exposures below a certain no-effectlevel generally do not result in individuals becoming sensitized. Wherehuman data were absent or sparse, OSHA relied on animal evidence to setthe revised limit. However, since chemically induced immunological sensitizationin laboratory animals involves the same mechanism as in humans (that is,immune reactions in animals can be mediated by either IgD or IgE immunoglobulins),sensitization reactions in animals are generally good predictors of immunereactions in humans. The discussions below describe the record evidence and OSHA's finding forthe substances in this group. These discussions illustrate the nature ofthe risk confronting exposed employees and the extent to which the riskof developing immune sensitization will be reduced among workers by thepromulgation of these new or revised limits. <ITAG tagnum="71">CAPTAFOL (DIFOLATAN)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 2425-06-1; Chemical Formula: C<T2>10</T2>H<T2>9</T2>C1<T2>4</T2>NO<T2>2</T2>S</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1066</ITAG>OSHA formerly had no permissible exposure limit for captafol. The proposedlimit for captafol was an 8-hour TWA of 0.1 mg/m3, with a skin notation.The 0.1-mg/m3 limit, which is consistent with that of the ACGIH, is thePEL included in this final rule; however, OSHA is not including in thefinal rule the skin notation proposed for this substance. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47,Table N6A) concurred with the Agency's selection of a PEL for captafol,which is a white, crystalline substance with a slight but characteristicodor. In humans, skin irritation, skin sensitization, and respiratory sensitizationhave been reported in both American and Japanese studies of farmers applyingcaptafol as a fungicide. Arimatsu (1970/Ex. 1-1010) reported that farmersusing captafol have experienced acute contact dermatitis manifesting aserythematous dermatitis and phototoxic eruptions. Kahn (1975, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 97) reported that workers cleaning up in an areawhere captafol was handled experienced skin and respiratory sensitization.The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) reported that dermal LD<T2>50</T2> for captafol is greater than 9 g/kg in rabbits, indicatingthat the substance is not readily absorbed through the skin. As discussedin Section VI.C.18, OSHA has determined that skin notations are appropriateonly when there is evidence that indicates that dermal contact may leadto skin absorption and increase the potential for systemic poisoning. Sincethis is not the case for captafol, OSHA finds that a skin notation is notwarranted. A two-year study conducted by the World Health Organization (Reinhardtand Brittelli 1981/Ex. 1-1063) reported growth depression in rats at captafoldietary levels of 1500 and 5000 ppm, and histopathologic examination revealedchanges in the livers and kidneys of the animals exposed at these levels.In male rats, an increase in liver-to-body-weight ratio was observed atlevels of 250 ppm and higher after 12 months of captafol feeding (Reinhardtand Brittelli 1981/Ex. 1-1063). No tumors were observed in this study.However, NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A) submitted comments on captafol showingthat several newer studies demonstrated that captafol is a broad-spectrumcarcinogen in mice and rats (Ito et al. 1984; EPA 1984, 1985, 1987). In1987, the EPA cancelled the registration for captafol on the basis of thissubstance's carcinogenicity in laboratory animals; the EPA considers captafola Category C substance, i.e., a possible human carcinogen. OSHA is awareof these recent studies on captafol's carcinogenicity and finds that theylend urgency to the establishment of a PEL for this previously unregulatedsubstance. NIOSH's was the only comment OSHA received on this substance.In the final rule, the Agency is establishing a permissible exposure limitfor captafol of 0.1 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA to protect workers against thesignificant risk of contact dermatitis and respiratory and skin irritationand sensitization, all material impairments of health, that are associatedwith exposure to captafol at the levels formerly permitted by the absenceof an OSHA limit. The Agency concludes that this 8-hour TWA PEL will substantiallyreduce these significant risks. <ITAG tagnum="71">COBALT METAL, DUST, AND FUME (as Co) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-48-4; Chemical Formula: Co</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1100</ITAG>OSHA formerly had an 8-hour TWA limit of 0.1 mg/m3 for cobalt metal, dust,and fume. The Agency proposed an 8-hour TWA of 0.05 mg/m3 for these substances,and NOISH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with the proposed limit. The finalrule establishes an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.05 mg/m3 for cobalt metal, dust,and fume; this limit is consistent with that of the ACGIH. Cobalt is agray, hard, magnetic, and somewhat malleable metal. Animal studies indicate that high intratracheal doses (10, 25, or 50 mg)of cobalt metal dust can cause obliterative bronchiolitis adenomatosisin guinea pigs (Schepers 1955/Ex. 1-365). Additional studies in animalshave shown that exposure to cobalt dust or fume causes hypersensitivityreactions. Increases in serum A-2 globulin and neuraminic acid occurredin dogs and rabbits exposed by inhalation to cobalt metal, metal fume,or carbide blend; injections of cobalt chloride produced similar reactions(Stokinger and Wagner 1958/Ex. 1-381). Studies conducted in miniswine haveshown that inhalation of 0.1 mg/m3 cobalt metal dust (50 percent alphaand 50 percent beta variety, with a size range of from 0.4 um to 3.6 um)has caused early (onset within three months) pulmonary disease. Wheezing,which indicates hypersensitivity, occurred in these animals during thefourth week of exposure to 0.1 or 1.0 mg/m3 for six hours/day, five days/week,for three months following a one-week sensitizing dose (Kerfoot, Fredrick,and Domeier 1975/Ex. 1-145). NIOSH (Ex. 150, Comments on Cobalt) submittedcomments pointing out that cobalt and cobalt compounds have caused local,injection-site tumors in experimental animals, and the AFL-CIO (Ex. 194,Appendix A) also noted that a ``potential carcinogenic effect'' has beenidentified for cobalt. Pulmonary disease has been reported frequently in workers exposed to cobaltin the manufacture of cemented tungsten carbide (Miller, Davis, Goldman,and Wyatts 1953/Ex. 1-40; Lundgren and Ohman 1954, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 144; Lundgren and Swenson 1953/Ex. 1-816). The adverse effect ofexposure is generally chronic interstitial pneumonitis. Fatalities havebeen reported occasionally from exposures to cobalt at concentrations of1 to 2 mg/m3 or less (Fairhall, Castberg, Carrozzo, and Brinton 1947/Ex.1-954; Fairhall, Keenan, and Brinton 1949/Ex. 1-479). An increase in serumA-2 globulin fraction was reported in the case of a welder exposed to fumescontaining cobalt; the welder had a history of exertional dyspnea and anabnormal chext X-ray (Siegesmund, Funahashi, and Pintar 1974/Ex. 1-372).Schwartz, Tulipan, and Birmingham (1957c, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 144) reported that allergic dermatitis has been caused by contact withcobalt and its compounds. Dr. Michael Silverstein, representing the UAW,commented in testimony (Tr. pp. 7-44 to 7-46) that OSHA should developancillary provisions, such as those for medical surveillance and personalprotective equipment, to protect exposed workers against skin contact withcobalt. However, as discussed earlier in this preamble, OSHA is currentlydeveloping generic standards to address these and other protective measures.In studies undertaken by the Michigan Department of Health (1946-1964,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 144), it was demonstrated that, in theperiod between 1946 and 1964, improved control measures had successfullyreduced cobalt metal dust and fume levels from 14.42 mg/m3 to levels below0.1 mg/m3; no new cases of systemic toxicity or dermatitis have since beenassociated with cobalt exposure in these facilities. The Pennsylvania Departmentof Health demonstrated that concentrations could be controlled easily to0.07 mg/m3; without controls, concentrations were about 0.5 mg/m3 (ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 144). In posthearing comments, NIOSH (Ex. 150, Comments on Cobalt) reported thefindings of two recent epidemiological studies in cobalt-exposed workers.A cohort mortality study by Mur et al. (1987, as cited in Ex. 150) founda statistically significant increase in lung cancer mortality in cobaltand sodium workers in an electrochemical plant. NIOSH noted that this studyhad several limitations: The small number of lung cancer cases observed;ascertainment problems; no smoking data; and no exposure data. A recentstudy of hard metal workers in Great Britain (Kusaka et al. 1986, as citedin Ex. 150) found occupationally induced asthma in cobalt-exposed workers,some of whom had average exposure levels below 0.05 mg/m3. NIOSH (Ex. 150,Comments on Cobalt) also noted that this study had several limitations:the small number of workers with asthma; incomplete occupational historiesfor some cases; and failure to ascertain confounding exposures. NIOSH also noted that the PEL of 0.05 mg/m3 may not protect all workersagainst the development of cobalt-induced asthma (Ex. 150, Comments onCobalt). Both the UAW (Tr. 7-44/7-46) and Dr. James Melinus of the NewYork State Department of Public Heath (Tr. 11-108) commented that pulmonarydisease and ischemic heart disease may be associated with exposures tocobalt at levels of 0.06 mg/m3 and, perhaps, to levels somewhat below.OSHA notes that the studies pointed to by these commenters involve confoundingexposures to tungsten, cement, and other hazardous alloys and have othermethodological limitations as well.In the final rule, the Agency is revising its 8-hour TWA limit for cobaltmetal, dust, and fumes from 0.1 mg/m3 to 0.05 mg/m3. The Agency concludesthat this limit will reduce the significant risk of material impairmentof health posed by respiratory disease and pulmonary sensitization, whichhave been demonstrated to occur at higher levels of exposure. OSHA notesthat the very recent literature is suggestive of effects even below thislevel; the Agency intends to continue to monitor the literature on cobaltin the future.<ITAG tagnum="71">ISOPHORONE DIISOCYANATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 4098-71-9; Chemical Formula: C<T2>12</T2>H<T2>18</T2>N<T2>2</T2>O<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"> H.S. No. 1222</ITAG>OSHA previously had no limit for isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). The Agencyproposed an 8-hour TWA of 0.005 ppm for this substance, with a 10-minuteshort-term limit of 0.02 ppm and a skin notation; these limits are consistentwith NIOSH's recommended limits for all isocyanates, and on Table N1 ofExhibit 8-47, NIOSH indicated its concurrence with the selection of thisPEL. The ACGIH has established an 8-hour TWA of 0.01 ppm and a skin notationfor IPDI. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA of 0.005ppm for isophorone diisocyanate, with a 15-minute STEL of 0.02 ppm anda skin notation.To date, there is little direct information on the health effects associatedwith exposure to this particular isocyanate. However, diisocyanates, ingeneral, cause irritation of the respiratory tract, decreases in pulmonaryfunction, and sensitization. The ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 334) cited tworeports in which workers exposed to isophorone diisocyanate suffered asthmaor dyspnea; neither of these reports contained quantitative exposure data(Clarke and Aldons 1981/Ex. 1-475; Tyrer 1979/Ex. 1-396). The ACGIH (1986/Ex.1-3, p. 334) recommended that the 0.01-ppm TLV-TWA established for 2,4-toluenediisocyanate (TDI) be applied to isophorone diisocyanate until informationspecific to IPDI becomes available; however, the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p.334) did not agree that the 0.02-ppm TLV-STEL established by the ACGIHfor toluene diisocyanate should also apply to IPDI. In its criteria documenton isocyanates, NIOSH (1978c/Ex. 1-259) used similar reasoning to reachthe conclusion that, on a molar basis, all of the diisocyanates would reactin a manner similar to that of TDI. NIOSH thus recommended that the limitsestablished for TDI (0.005 ppm TWA and 0.02 ppm as a 10-minute short-termlimit) be applied to all diisocyanates. In support of the recommended short-termexposure limit for all diisocyanates, NIOSH (1978c/Ex. 1-259) cited a studyreporting that 12 workers in an automobile plant had developed severe respiratorysymptoms after exposure to 0.03 to 0.07 ppm TDI for one week.NIOSH (Ex. 150, Comments on Isophorone Diisocyanate) reported that IARChas recently (1986) published results of a positive carcinogenesis bioassayinvolving TDI that found TDI-induced tumors in both rats and mice. In responseto IARC's determination that the evidence in animals is sufficient to classifyTDI as a carcinogen in animals, NIOSH is developing a Current IntelligenceBulletin on TDI. OSHA received no comments suggesting that feasibilityis a problem at the revised limits, although the proposal specificallyrequested additional feasibility information from the public. OSHA receivedseveral comments on IPDI (Exs. 116, 144, 194). The Workers Institute forSafety and Health (WISH) argued that OSHA should regulate all six of theisocyanates, rather than the three being regulated in this rulemaking,because employers would otherwise tend to substitute the unregulated membersof the isocyanate family for those that are regulated, and the unregulatedsubstances might in fact prove as hazardous as the regulated isocyanates(Ex. 116, p. 34). In response to WISH, OSHA notes that the scale and scopeof the present rulemaking demanded that OSHA adopt certain methods of selectingsubstances to include in this rulemaking (see the discussion in the preamblesection on ``Boundaries to Regulation''); the Agency believes that theisocyanates included in the present rulemaking are those for which thehealth evidence is adequate to serve as a basis for limit-setting. TheAFL-CIO (Ex. 194) commented along the same lines as WISH, but in additionwas of the opinion that the proposed 8-hour TWA PEL was not necessary.OSHA does not agree, believing instead that the 8-hour TWA limit will provideadditional protection and is appropriate in workplace exposure situationscharacterized by steady-state exposures. The New Jersey Department of PublicHealth (Ex. 144) recommended the use of EPA's IRIS data base to set a limitfor IPDI; the appropriateness of the IRIS data for limit-setting is discussedin Section VI.A. of the preamble.OSHA is establishing a 0.005-ppm 8-hour TWA, a 0.02-ppm 15-minute short-termlimit, and a skin notation for IPDI. The short-term limit of 0.02 ppm isdesigned to prevent the severe irritation effects associated with exposureto the diisocyanates even in nonsensitized workers, and the skin notationwill prevent dermal absorption of this substance. The Agency has establisheda 15-minute, rather than a 10-minute, short-term limit for isophorone diisocyanatebecause OSHA has decided, as a matter of policy, to conform all of itsrevised short-term limits (5, 10, 15, or 20 minutes) to a duration of 15minutes. The Agency finds that the TWA and STEL limits will both protectnonsensitized workers against IPDI's sensitizing effects and minimize asthmaticreactions among sensitized workers. OSHA concludes that these revised limitswill reduce the significant risk of material health impairment (i.e., immune-system-mediatedpulmonary sensitization, which is associated with isocyanate exposure.In addition, the Agency also finds that these limits are feasible. OSHAwill continue to monitor the toxicological literature on all of the isocyanatesin the future.<ITAG tagnum="71">PHENOTHIAZINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 92-84-2; Chemical Formula: S(C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>)<T2>2</T2>NH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1313</ITAG>OSHA previously had no occupational exposure limit for phenothiazine. TheAgency proposed an 8-hour TWA PEL of 5 mg/m3 for this substance, with askin notation; the final rule establishes this limit and a skin notation,which are consistent with the recommendations of the ACGIH. NIOSH (Ex.8-47, Table N1) concurred with OSHA's proposed limit for phenothiazine.OSHA is basing the PEL for phenothiazine primarily on the findings of astudy by Mawhinney and Rakow (1968, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p.472) that showed that exposure to 15 to 48 mg/m3 of phenothiazine was associatedwith skin sensitization but not with other acute systemic effects. Symptomsof sensitization in workers included burning and itching of the skin. Accompanyingthese sensitization reactions were pinkish-red-colored hair and brown fingernails.Phenothiazine has been reported to cause photosensitization of the skin,and intense irritation and itching of the skin have been associated withinhalation of phenothiazine spray (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 472).In the final rule, OSHA is establishing an 8-hour TWA PEL of 5 mg/m3, witha skin notation; this limit is below the exposure range that has been shownto cause sensitization reactions in workers. OSHA concludes that the uncontrolledoccupational exposures to phenothiazine that were possible in the absenceof an OSHA limit pose a significant risk of sensitization, which is a materialimpairment of health. Accordingly, the Agency is establishing an exposurelimit that will substantially reduce this significant risk.<ITAG tagnum="71">PHENYL GLYCIDYL ETHER  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 122-60-1; Chemical Formula C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>5</T2>OCH<T2>2</T2>CHOCH<T2>2</T2>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1315</ITAG>OSHA's former 8-hour TWA limit for phenyl glycidyl ether (PGE) was 10 ppm.The Agency proposed a TWA of 1 ppm for this substance, which is consistentwith the ACGIH's limit for PGE. NIOSH recommends a 15-minute ceiling limitof 1 ppm for phenyl glycidyl ether, which is a colorless liquid. In thefinal rule, OSHA establishes an 8-hour TWA PEL of 1 ppm for phenyl glycidylether.  Exposure to PGE causes systemic effects and irritation. Studies by Hine,Kodama, Wellington, and colleagues (1956/Ex. 1-331) showed pulmonary inflammationand liver changes in some of the rats exposed to 100 ppm for seven hoursdaily for 50 days; respiratory distress and minimal eye irritation werealso observed in the exposed animals. Intragastric LD<T2>50</T2> values of 1.40 g/kg for mice and 3.85 g/kg for rats were alsoreported. Animals displayed central nervous system (CNS) depression, anddeath was caused by respiratory paralysis; in the survivors, these CNSeffects were transient. The percutaneous LD<T2>50</T2> reported for rabbits was 2.99 g/kg. Other studies have reporteda single-dose oral LD<T2>50</T2> of 4.26 g/kg, although exposure for 8 hours to the near-saturatedvapor was not lethal (Smyth, Carpenter, Weil, and Pozzani 1954/Ex. 1-440).Terrill and Lee (1977/Ex. 1-390) reported kidney, liver, spleen, thymus,and testicular changes in rats exposed to phenyl glycidyl ether at 29 ppmfor four hours daily, five days/week for two weeks. At concentrations of12 or 5 ppm, these authors observed no effects other than hair loss afterexposures of six hours/day, five days/week for nine weeks; however, after18 weeks, 10 percent of male and 25 percent of female rats exhibited alopecia(hair loss). These health effects were believed by the authors to reflectdirect irritation of the skin rather than systemic absorption (Terrilland Lee 1977/Ex. 1-390).  Reports of workers using or handling phenyl glycidyl ether have describedmoderate skin irritation on prolonged or repeated contact. In addition,several cases of skin sensitization have been reported (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 476).  NIOSH (1978d/Ex. 1-232) notes that glycidyl ethers are biologically reactivecompounds because of the presence of the epoxide group; these compoundshave also been shown to cause cytotoxic effects and to the mutagenic inshort-term bioassays. Terrill and Lee (1977/Ex. 1-390) exposed rats repeatedlyto 1 ppm PGE and observed no effects, although skin damage was observedat 5 ppm. Inconclusive evidence of testicular degeneration was reportedin some of the rats exposed to levels as low as 1.75 ppm (Haskell Laboratoryreports, as cited in NIOSH 1978d/Ex. 1-232, p. 114). At 10 ppm, five day/weekexposures for 10 weeks caused respiratory tract irritation and early signsof liver necrosis in rats (Hine, Kodama, Wellington et al. 1956/Ex. 1-331). OSHA received only one comment on this substance. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, TableN6B) does not concur with OSHA's establishment of a PEL of 1 ppm for PGE;NIOSH recommends that this limit be expressed as a 15-minute short-termlimit. The Agency concludes that the evidence indicates that repeated,prolonged exposures to PGE have been responsible for the adverse exposureeffects observed and, therefore, that an 8-hour TWA PEL is more appropriatefor this substance than a ceiling limit or STEL.  In the final rule, the Agency is reducing the 8-hour TWA PEL for phenylglycidyl ether to 1 ppm. OSHA concludes that this limit will protect workersfrom the significant risk of skin sensitization, skin and respiratory tractirritation, testicular damage, and liver necrosis (all of which are materialimpairments of health) that are potentially associated with exposure toconcentrations at the former PGE limit of 10 ppm. OSHA finds that the revisedlimit will substantially reduce these significant risks.  <ITAG tagnum="71">PICRIC ACID  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 88-89-1; Chemical Formula: HOC<T2>6</T2>H<T2>2</T2>(NO<T2>2</T2>)<T2>3</T2>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1329</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for picric acid was 0.1 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA, witha skin notation. The Agency proposed to retain the 0.1-mg/m3 TWA limitand skin notation and to add a 15-minute STEL of 0.3 mg/m3 for this substance.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurred with the proposal. In the final rule,the Agency has retained the 8-hour TWA of 0.1 mg/m3 and a skin notation,but has determined that the evidence is insufficient to establish the 15-minuteshort-term exposure limit of 0.3 mg/m3 proposed by the Agency for thissubstance.  Picric acid occurs as colorless to pale yellow, odorless, intensely bittercrystals. Picric acid and its salts are toxic by ingestion, skin contact,or inhalation, and these substances also have skin-sensitization potential(Schwartz 1944/Ex. 1-367). Available reports concerning human exposuresdescribe edema, papules, vesicles, and desquamations of the face, mouth,and nose (Sunderman, Weidman, and Batson 1945/Ex. 1-383). The symptomsof systemic poisoning following skin absorption include headache, vertigo,vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, and skin and conjunctival discoloration, aswell as discoloration of urine and albuminuria; high-dose exposures causeddestruction of erythrocytes and produced gastroenteritis, hemorrhagic nephritis,and acute hepatitis (Sunderman, Weidman, and Batson 1945/Ex. 1-383). Occupationalexposure to ammonium picrate dust at concentrations of 0.0088 to 0.1947mg/m3 caused dermatitis only in those workers who were least exposed; theACGIH believes that this suggests that desensitization or adaptation occurswith repeated exposure (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 490). Except for the concurrenceof NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1), no comments related to picric acid weresubmitted to the record. Since the time of OSHA's proposal, the ACGIH hasdecided to delete its TLV-STEL for picric acid (<T3>Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices for 1988-1989,</T3>ACGIH 1988b). OSHA has re-examined the evidence described above andhas determined that the 0.1-mg/m3 TWA limit alone is sufficient to protectemployees from the significant risk of contact dermatitis associated withexposure to picric acid (OSHA's general policies for establishing short-termlimits are described in Section VI.C.17). Therefore, OSHA is not includinga STEL for picric acid in the final rule.  In the final rule, OSHA is retaining an 8-hour TWA of 0.1 mg/m3 and a skinnotation for picric acid. The Agency concludes that these limits will protectworkers against the dermatitis and sensitization associated with occupationalexposures to picric acid. OSHA finds that both dermatitis and sensitizationare material impairments of health.  <ITAG tagnum="71">SUBTILISINS  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 1395-21-7; Chemical Formula: None  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1373</ITAG>OSHA did not formerly have an occupational exposure limit for the subtilisins;the ACGIH has established a ceiling limit of 0.06 ug/m3 for these substances.OSHA proposed a 0.06-ug/m3 ceiling for the subtilisins, and the final ruleestablishes this limit. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) agreed with the selectionof this PEL. The subtilisins are proteolytic bacterial enzymes (producedby various <T3>Bacillus</T3> species) that are used primarily in laundry detergentsbut also in contact lens cleaners, film processing, and the food industry.They are considered a threat to occupational health because they causeimmune-system-mediated bronchoconstriction and respiratory symptoms inaddition to primary irritation of the skin and respiratory tract (ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 540; Pepys, Hargreave, Longbottom, and Faux 1969/Ex. 1-568).A report by the California Department of Public Health (1969, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 540) showed that several workers were hospitalizedafter exposure to subtilisins in a detergent formulation plant where the``safe limit'' for subtilisins was set at 0.12 ug/m3. There is no informationon whether this limit was exceeded in this episode or what other conditionsprevailed. In addition to NIOSH's comment, OSHA received several othercomments on the proposed limit for the subtilisins (Exs. 8-70, 3-684, 137,164, and 98-13; Tr. p. 3-304; Tr. pp. 10-182 to 10-190). Most of thesecommenters were of the opinion that OSHA should not establish an exposurelimit for the subtilisins because there is currently no method availableto monitor workplace exposures to these substances. In addition, thesecommenters submitted information to the record on the subtilisins' healtheffects to supplement the data base relied on by OSHA in the proposed rule.Typical of these comments was the submittal of Beth Concoby and Alice Caddowon behalf of Genencor, Inc., a manufacturer of subtilisins:<ITAG tagnum="21">Genencor concurs with OSHA that the PEL's should be reviewed on aperiodic basis and updated as new valid scientific information becomesavailable. However, * * * \1/2\i\3/4\n the proposed standard OSHA is planningto adopt an exposure limit for subtilisins which does not currently havea validated sampling and analytical method for personal sampling * * *.There is also additional health data available that needs to be consideredin promulgating an appropriate PEL for subtilisins (Ex. 3-684, pp. 1, 4).</ITAG>The Enzyme Technical Association (Exs. 8-70, 164, 137, and 98-13; Tr. pp.10-182 to 10-190) specifically objected to the Agency's use of an earlystudy on the subtilisins; OSHA has responded to this comment by carefullyreviewing the recent toxicological literature on the subtilisins, includingseveral new health studies submitted by these participants. These studiesdocument the respiratory toxicity and sensitization potential of the subtilisins.For example, a study by Juniper and Roberts (1984, as cited in Exs. 8-70and 3-684) reports that 3.7 percent of exposed workers experienced dose-relatedsensitization symptoms (enzyme asthma, or EA) on exposure to enzyme detergentpowders. Symptoms included sweating, headache, pain in the chest, influenza-likesymptoms, cough, breathlessness, and wheezing ``sufficient at times toincapacitate the patient completely'' (Juniper and Roberts 1984, p. 128,as cited in Exs. 8-70 and 3-684). This study also reports that the ``primeinitiating cause of episodes of EA in otherwise asymptomatic subjects wasundoubtedly dust level `peaks' rather than a low but continuous exposure''(Juniper and Roberts 1984, p. 131, as cited in Exs. 8-70 and 3-684).  In response to the objections of commenters (Exs. 8-70 and 3-684) thatno sampling and analytical method exists for the subtilisins, OSHA notesthat several such methods have been published (Fulwiler 1971; Fulwiler,Abbot, and Darcy 1972; Bruce, Dunn, Brotherton et al. 1976). The AmericanIndustrial Hygiene Association (Tr. p. 3-304) was in favor of keeping thesubtilisins in this rulemaking and submitted a sampling and analyticalmethod for these substances. Thus, OSHA finds that there is no issue ofmonitoring feasibility for this group of enzymes.  Another study in monkeys (Coate, Busey, Schoenfisch, and Newmann 1978,as cited in Exs. 8-70 and 3-684) reports the effects of exposing animals6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 6 months to atmospheres containing syntheticdetergent dust at 1, 10, or 100 mg/m3 together with enzyme dust at 0.001,0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/m3. Exposures to 10 or 100 mg/m3 detergent dust togetherwith 0.01 or 1 mg/m3 enzyme dust produced gross signs of respiratory distress,pulmonary histopathological effects, and pulmonary function impairment(Coate et al. 1978, as cited in Exs. 8-70 and 3-684).  These studies and others (McMurrain 1970; Medical Research Council 1976;Zachariae, Hoegh-Thomsen, Witmeur, and Wide 1981; Thorne Hillebrand, Magreniet al. 1986; Weill, Waggenspack, DeRouen, and Ziskind 1974, all as citedin Exs. 8-70 and 3-684) demonstrate convincingly the need for an exposurelimit for the subtilisins. One study (Thorne, Hillebrand, Magreni et al.1986, as cited in Exs. 8-70 and 3-684) reports that, in guinea pigs, theno-observed-effect level for pulmonary sensitization induced by exposureto the subtilisins for 15 minutes/day for 5 consecutive days was between0.0083 and 0.041 mg/m3. Animals exposed on the same regimen at higher levelsdeveloped enzyme asthma (Thorne, Hillebrand, Magreni et al. 1986, as citedin Exs. 8-70 and 3-684). Recent evidence also demonstrates that the manufacturersof these enzymes have been able to control the dust exposures of theiremployees to levels ``considerably lower than the proposed * * * TLV ** * recommendation \1/2\ of a ceiling of 0.06 ug/m3 \3/4\'' (McMurrain1970, as cited in Ex. 3-684). These reductions in exposure have occurredas a result of a program of strict environmental controls and the adoptionof a prilling process that encapsulates the enzymes to reduce enzyme-ladendust.OSHA is establishing a ceiling limit of 0.06 ug/m 3 for the subtilisins;the evidence described above indicates that a ceiling limit of 0.06 ug/m\3\for the subtilisins is necessary to reduce the significant risks of respiratorysensitization, skin irritation, and respiratory effects among members ofthe exposed worker population; OSHA finds that all of these exposure-relatedhealth effects constitute material impairments of health. Recent studies(described above) show that this limit is being achieved at the presenttime. OSHA concludes that this limit will substantially reduce these significantrisks.<ITAG tagnum="71">TOLUENE-2, 4-DIISOCYANATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 584-84-9; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>3</T2>(NCO)<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1398</ITAG>The former OSHA limit for toluene-2, 4-diisocyanate (TDI) was a ceilingof 0.02 ppm. OSHA's proposed and final rule limits for TDI are 0.005 ppmas an 8-hour TWA and 0.02 ppm as a 15-minute STEL. The ACGIH (1986/Ex.1-3, p. 584) and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) both recommend a TWA of 0.005ppm and a STEL of 0.02 ppm for TDI.TDI is one of the most frequently encountered occupational sensitizers,and it is also a known cross-sensitizer. The revised limit is based onhuman data showing that workers can develop sensitization reactions atexposure levels below the 0.02-ppm level. Elkins and colleagues (1962/Ex.1-138) reviewed the incidence of TDI intoxication in 14 plants in Massachusettsbetween 1957 and 1962. In eleven instances of TDI intoxication, the averageconcentration of TDI was 0.015 ppm, and in nine cases the average concentrationwas below 0.01 ppm. In all plants where the average levels were above 0.01ppm, TDI had caused respiratory problems. TDI-related respiratory problemswere not observed when the average concentration of TDI was maintainedbelow 0.007 ppm (Elkins, McCarl, Brugsch, and Fahy 1962/Ex. 1-138).Williamson conducted two TDI studies (1964 and 1965, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 584) that revealed a 5-percent sensitization rate in 99workers exposed for 18 months to average levels of TDI below 0.02 ppm.The author believed that accidental spills accounted for the high sensitizationrate. Williamson also found that six sensitized workers out of 18 exposedto concentrations of TDI below 0.02 ppm for 14 months showed marked decreasesin lung function (Williamson 1964 and 1965, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 584).A NOEL (no-observed-effect level) for TDI has been documented. In 1975,Roper and Cromer (Ex. 1-147) failed to observe any symptoms of respiratoryillness or changes in pulmonary function in nine employees working in aplant where breathing zone samples showed TDI concentrations of 0.001 to0.002 ppm.Wegman and colleagues (1974/Ex. 1-112; 1977/Ex. 1-171; 1982/Ex. 1-133)observed a dose-response relationship between exposure and long-term declinein lung function as documented by test results among TDI-exposed employees.Only for those workers exposed to less than 0.002 ppm TDI were the resultsof lung function tests normal (Wegman, Pagnotto, Fine, and Peters 1974/Ex. 1-112; Wegman, Peters, Pagnotto, and Fine 1977/Ex. 1-171; Wegman, Musk,Main, and Pagnotto 1982/Ex. 1-133).Several commenters submitted comments on TDI. NIOSH (Tr. 3-96, 97) andthe United Auto Workers (Tr. 7-38 to 7-44) urged OSHA to designate TDIas a carcinogen, while the Dow Chemical Company (Ex. 106A) argued thatTDI should not be so designated. As discussed in the preamble section entitled``Boundaries to Regulation,'' OSHA is not specifically designating substancesas carcinogens; many other organizations, such as the International Agencyfor Research on Cancer, the ACGIH, NIOSH, etc. do so. The Workers Institutefor Safety and Health (Ex. 106) urged OSHA to regulate all six of the isocyanates,rather than the three included in this rulemaking, on the grounds thatemployees would switch to the unregulated isocyanates, which might presentas great a hazard as the regulated ones. In response to WISH, OSHA notesthat the scale and scope of the present rulemaking required that OSHA makedecisions on substances to be included to facilitate the process; the selectionprocess is described in the preamble section entitied ``Boundaries to Regualtion.''The Agency concludes that the evidence clearly demonstrates that workersare at significant risk of pulmonary sensitization reactions at the formerPEL, as evidenced by declines in pulmonary function observed among workersexposed below this level. OSHA has determined that establishing a 0.005-ppmTWA with a 0.02-ppm STEL will substantially reduce this significant risk.The Agency notes that effects have been observed at levels somewhat belowthe final rule's PEL; OSHA will therefore continue to monitor the toxicologicalliterature on this substance carefully in the future.Conclusions for This Group of Sensitizing ToxicantsFor the eight sensitizing agents included in this category of substances,OSHA concludes that there are significant occupational risks associatedwith exposure. The effects caused by such exposures are mediated by theimmune system and include skin sensitization, substantial decrements inlung function, bronchoconstriction, asthma, and severe skin irritation,all of which constitute material impairments of health and functional capacity.Reducing or establishing exposure limits for these toxic substances willsubstantially reduce these significant workplace risks.<ITAG tagnum="81">15. Substances for Which Limits Are Based on Avoidance of Cancer </ITAG>IntroductionThis group comprises 16 substances for which the ACGIH or NIOSH has recommendednew or revised limits based on evidence that occupational exposure maybe associated with an increased cancer risk. Table C15-1 lists the formerOSHA permissible exposure levels (PELs), the proposed PELs, the PELs establishedin the final rule, and the CAS and HS numbers for these substances. OSHAis proposing to revise existing TWA and/or STEL limits for six substances,retain a PEL for four substances currently listed on Table Z-2, and addlimits for four substances not currently listed on OSHA's Z tables. Forone previously unregulated substance, chromyl chloride, OSHA has concludedthat a separate 6(b) rulemaking is appropriate. For one substance OSHAis not establishing an exposure limit at this time.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M003</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">insert illustration(s) 01323-1325</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>The following discussion addresses some general aspects of carcinogenicity,together with the methodology used by OSHA in previous rulemakings to assesscarcinogenic hazards. Two representative substances are reviewed in termsof their effects, dose-response considerations, and quantitative risk assessmentsto evaluate the decrease in risk of developing cancer that is expectedafter revising or establishing PELs for these substances. In this section,quantitative risk models that are widely accepted by the scientific communityare used as a means of estimating cancer risks. The multistage model, whichis the model primarily used by OSHA, is preferred over other models becauseit is based on a more plausible biological mechanism of cancer than theother models. Description of the Health Effects Cancer is a life-threatening and particularly insidious disease that isbrought about by the invasion of organ systems by abnormal tissue growth.The abnormal issue is comprised of cells that have been altered in sucha way as to cause unrestricted cell growth. As this unrestricted growthprogresses, the abnormal tissue begins to interfere with the vital functionsof normal organ systems. In the absence of medical intervention, most formsof cancer are ultimately lethal. In some instances (e.g., colon cancer,breast cancer), life can be prolonged through chemotherapy, radiation treatment,surgery, or some combination of these; however, the quality of life ofthe victims of cancer is usually severely affected. In other instances,such as lung cancer, there is little hope of survival, even when aggressivetreatment strategies are employed. In past rulemakings on occupationalcarcinogens (see, for example, Benzene, Ethylene Oxide, Asbestos, and Formaldehyde),OSHA has held that malignant disease constitutes material impairment ofhealth and functional capacity. An increased risk of developing cancer has been associated with occupationalor environmental exposure to a number of chemical substances. The developmentof chemically induced cancer in humans and animals is a complex and multistepprocess that is not completely understood. It is currently believed thatthe mechanism by which cancer develops requires at least two stages: initiationand promotion. Initiation occurs when chemicals interact either directlyor indirectly with DNA to cause a heritable mutation. Alterations in DNAstructure may cause an incorrect reading of the DNA sequence during replicationand result in more altered cells, which may eventually be expressed asa tumor. There is a correlation between substances that are mutagenic in<T3>in vitro </T3>test systems and their ability to cause cancer. Althoughgenotoxic assays are not capable of predicting carcinogenic potential withcertainty, such assays are useful for the preliminary identification ofsubstances that may have the potential to cause cancer. The second stage in the carcinogenic process is promotion. Promotion isconsidered to be the likely mechanism of action when there is no evidencethat a substance interacts with genetic material (e.g., when <T3>in vitro </T3>mutagenicity assays are negative). Peroxisome proliferation,immunosuppression, and hormonal alterations are examples of promotionalevents; these events facilitate the unrestricted multiplication of initiatedcells, leading to the development of cancer. When a substance or its metabolitepossesses both initiation and promotion capabilities, it is consideredto be a complete carcinogen (i.e., exposure to the substance alone is sufficientto cause cancer). Examples of such substances that OSHA has recently regulatedinclude asbestos, benzene, ethylene oxide, and formaldehyde. In all of OSHA's past rulemakings for carcinogens, the Agency has useda weight-of-evidence approach to assess the carcinogenic potential of chemicalsubstances. This approach involves examining all available human epidemiologicstudies, clinical and case studies, animal studies, mutagenicity studies,and metabolic studies, combined with a quantitative assessment of cancerrisk, to make determinations regarding the potential that occupationalexposure to a substance increases the risk of cancer. OSHA relies mostheavily on epidemiologic studies of worker populations and well-conductedanimal bioassays to make these determinations. OSHA's overall approachto promulgating regulations for carcinogens has been upheld in a numberof court decisions. The following discussion summarizes how epidemiologic and animal studiesare used to assess cancer risk.<T3>Epidemiology studies. </T3>Epidemiological studies that include detailedexposure data provide the best evidence for describing a causal relationshipbetween exposure to a substance and the onset of cancer in humans. Epidemiologicevidence has been relied on heavily in OSHA's decisions to promulgate standardsfor the carcinogens benzene, asbestos, and arsenic. At a minimum, positiveepidemiologic studies provide qualitative proof of a causal relationshipbetween exposure to a substance and the development of cancer. A generallack of quantitative exposure data and the long latencies between onsetof exposure and appearance of disease may make it difficult to derive quantitativedose-response relationships from epidemiological studies. However, theability of such studies to link exposures to carcinogens to cancer in humansoutweighs these limitations.Because of the long latency periods associated with chemically inducedcancer in humans, these studies cannot be used to detect disease untilafter irreparable harm has been done. To protect workers or other humanpopulations, therefore, it is necessary to assess the risk of such effectsbefore they occur. The data used for this purpose derive from animal bioassays;these data are used to predict potential human responses and to infer acausal relationship between exposure to a substance and the onset of disease.<T3>Animal data. </T3>Animal studies frequently provide the best dose-responsedata for chemically induced cancer. When relying on such studies, assumptionsmust be made in order to extrapolate from animal bioassay data to humans;the most important of these are that physiologic, pharmacokinetic, andbiochemical parameters are similar between mammalian species. To the extentthat adequate metabolic data are available, such data may be used to refinethe extrapolation from animals to humans. Despite the need to make suchassumptions, it is widely accepted that animals are acceptable surrogatesfor estimating potential cancer risks in humans. This confidence derivesfrom the observation, after many years of conducting bioassay studies,that there appears to be a reasonable concordance between carcinogeniceffects in animals and these effects in humans.Dose-Response and Quantitative Assessment of RiskUnlike other chemically induced toxic effects discussed in this preamble,a large body of scientific knowledge has accumulated regarding the mechanismsby which carcinogens act and the quantitative relationship between doseand biological response. As a result of these investigations, several mathematicalapproaches have been developed that permit estimates to be made of thecancer risk that is associated with exposure to low doses of carcinogenicsubstances.Since the dominant view of the carcinogenic process holds that most cancerinitiators cause irreversible damage to DNA, there is reason to assumethat the dose-response of most carcinogens will follow a linear, nonthresholdrelationship. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP 1985/Ex.1-1128) recommends the use of models that incorporate low-dose linearitywhen the data are limited and uncertainty exists regarding the mechanismsof carcinogenic action. In conducting risk assessments for prior rulemakings,OSHA has generally relied on the linearized multistage model.The multistage model used to assess cancer risks associated with exposureto substances in this group is GLOBAL83, a model developed by K.S. Crumpand colleagues. If P(d) represents the lifetime risk of cancer at dosed, and A(d) is the extra risk over the background rate at dose d, thenthe multistage model has the following form:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L0,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,40</C> <H1>A(d)=1^exp[^(q</H1><T2>1</T2>d+q<T2>2</T2>d2+. . .+q<T2>k</T2>dk)]<ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">q<T2>i</T2>andgreater;0</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">i=1,2,3, . . .,k</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">and A(d)=[P(d^P(0)]/[1^P(0)]</ITAG>For a unique set of q<T2>i</T2>, this function will adequately describe (or fit) the experimentallyderived data. How well the model describes the data may be mathematicallydetermined by what are termed goodness-of-fit tests. Once the model isfit to the data, the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and the 95-percentupper-confidence limit (UCL) of A(d) are calculated using the 95-percentupper-confidence limit on parameter q<T2>1</T2> (q<T2>1</T2>*). The MLE is the point estimate of A(d), and is therefore consideredthe best estimate of extra risk at dose d.Dr. Nathan J. Karch, President of Karch Associates and an expert in riskassessment, testified on the appropriateness of using the linearized multistagemodel to estimate occupational cancer risk:<ITAG tagnum="21">The multistage model and the program upon which it is based [GLOBAL83]involves a number of assumptions that are considered unlikely to underestimaterisk. At lower doses, the risk is assumed to be linear in dose, and nothreshold is assumed to exist * * *. The risk was assumed to be independentof background rates of cancer * * *.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I recognize with growing knowledge of the complexity of various possiblemechanisms for cancer induction, that several aspects of the model havecome under increasing investigation * * *. Despite what may appear to beconservative assumptions in the use of animal data with the multistagemodel * * * the multistage model is not likely to be overly conservativeat most of the exposures contemplated by this rulemaking. Since the proposedPELs are similar to experimental doses in animals in many cases, the riskestimates from the multistage model tend to be less conservative unless[the PELs] are very high in relation to experimental doses. Moreover, athigh doses the risk estimates produced by GLOBAL are similar to those generatedby the other commonly used models (Tr. p. 13-50).</ITAG>OSHA asked Dr. Karch to evaluate the scientific literature on the substancesin this group to determine whether the data for each substance were suitablefor estimating quantitative cancer risk using the multistage model. Dr.Karch found the data to be suitable for the following substances: acrylamide,amitrole, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, styrene, o-toluidine, p-toluidine,and vinyl bromide (Ex. 85- Tr. pp. 13-50). (Dr. Karch also found the dataadequate to perform quantitative assessments for nickel sulfide roastingand beryllium compounds; these assessments were not included in OSHA'sNPRM since no revision of the PELs for these materials was proposed). Forthe remaining substances examined by Dr. Karch, the data were judged tobe unsuitable for use with the multistage model, and, as such, it was impossibleto estimate quantitative cancer risk associated with exposure to thesesubstances.<ITAG tagnum="21">An analysis that we perform[ed on] extrapolations from annual datausing the multistage model in previous OSHA rulemakings on benzene, ethyleneoxide and formaldehyde disclosed that the best, meaning maximum likelihoodestimates, from the multistage model were similar and not above the rangeof estimates from epidemiologic data available * * * [on] workers (Tr.pp. 13-5 to 13-53).</ITAG>For those substances for which data were suitable for estimating quantitativecancer risks, OSHA relied on these estimates, in part, for making its significantrisk findings. OSHA has discussed its approach for making significant riskdeterminations in a number of rulemakings dealing with carcinogens. Thisapproach has been upheld by several courts of appeals. Although not discussedin detail here, the same methodology is being followed in this rulemaking.(See Arsenic, 48 <T3>FR </T3>1816, 1901-1902 (Jan. 14, 1983), upheld <T3>ASARCO </T3>v. <T3>OSHA</T3>, 746 F.2d 483 (9th Cir., 1984); Benzene, 52 <T3>FR </T3>34507 (September 11, 1987); Ethylene Oxide, 49 <T3>FR </T3>25763 (June 22, 1984), <T3>Public Citizen </T3>v. <T3>Tyson</T3>, 796 F.2d 1479 (D.C.

Cir., 1988).)The Supreme Court, in its <T3>Benzene </T3>decision, indicated when a reasonable person might considera risk significant and take steps to decrease it. The Court stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">It is the Agency's responsibility to determine in the first instancewhat it considers to be a ``significant'' risk. Some risks are plainlyacceptable and others are plainly unacceptable. If, for example, the oddsare one in a billion that a person will die from cancer by taking a drinkof chlorinated water, the risk clearly could not be considered significant.On the other hand, if the odds are one in a thousand that regular inhalationof gasoline vapors that are 2% benzene will be fatal a reasonable personmight well consider the risk significant and take the appropriate stepsto decrease or eliminate it. (<T3>I.U.D. </T3>v. <T3>A.P.I.</T3>, 448 U.S. at 655).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Court stated that ``while the Agency must support its findingsthat a certain level of risk exists with substantial evidence, we recognizethat its determination that a particular level of risk is `significant'will be based largely on policy considerations.'' The Court added thatthe significant risk determination required by the OSH Act is ``not a mathematicalstraitjacket,'' and that ``OSHA is not required to support its findingswith anything approaching scientific certainty.'' The Court ruled that``a reviewing court [is] to give OSHA some leeway where its findings mustbe made on the frontiers of scientific knowledge [and that * * *] the Agencyis free to use conservative assumptions in interpreting the data with respectto carcinogens, risking error on the side of overprotection rather thanunderprotection'' (448 U.S. at 655, 656).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As part of the overall significant risk determination, OSHA considersa number of factors. These include the type of the risk presented, thequality of the underlying data, the reasonableness of the risk assessments,the statistical significance of the findings and the significance of risk(see, for example, Arsenic, 48 FR 1864, January 14, 1983).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">OSHA pointed out that guidance for the Agency in evaluating significantrisk is provided by an examination of occupational risk rates and legislativeintent. For example, in the high-risk occupations of firefighting, andmining and quarrying, the average risk of death from all causes of occupationalinjury or an acute occupationally related illness from a lifetime of employment(45 years) is 27.45 and 20.16 per 1,000 employees respectively. Typicaloccupational risk of death in occupations of average risk are 2.7 per 1,000for all service employment. Typical lifetime occupational risks of deathin occupations of relatively low risk are 0.48 per 1,000 in electric equipmentand 0.07 per 1,000 in retail clothing. These rates are derived from 1979and 1980 Bureau of Labor Statistics data from employers with 11 or moreemployees adjusted to 45 years of employment for 46 weeks per year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Congress passed the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 becauseof a determination that occupational safety and health risks were too high.Based on this it is clear that Congress gave OSHA authority to reduce risksof average or above average magnitude when feasible. Further the SupremeCourt stated that ``if the odds are one in a thousand that regular inhalationof gasoline vapors that are 2% benzene will be fatal a reasonable personmight well take the appropriate steps to decrease or eliminate it'' (448U.S. at 656).</ITAG>In this final rule, OSHA is using the general approach and guidance describedabove for making significant risk determinations for carcinogens.The following sections discuss the carcinogenicity evidence for the chemicalslisted in Table C15-1. A brief discussion of the data and a quantitativerisk assessment (where appropriate) are included to demonstrate the reductionin cancer risk that could result from lowering the current OSHA PELs orestablishing new limits for these potential carcinogens.<ITAG tagnum="71">ACRYLAMIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 79-06-1; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>2</T2>=CHCONH<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1008</ITAG>The former OSHA 8-hour TWA permissible exposure limit for acrylamide was0.3 mg/m3, with a skin notation, and the Agency proposed a revised PELof 0.03 mg/m3, with a skin notation, for this substance, based on evidenceof its carcinogenicity in animals. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A) concursthat these limits are appropriate for acrylamide. The ACGIH recommendsa TLV of 0.03 mg/m3 for this substance (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 12). Thefinal rule promulgates an 8-hour TWA PEL of 0.03 mg/m3, with a skin notation,for acrylamide.Acrylamide is a white solid and is widely used as a reactive monomer orintermediate in organic synthesis, and polyacrylamide is a polymer thatis used in the manufacture of a host of products, including adhesives,mining chemicals, fibers, pharmaceuticals, animal feed, paper sizing, moldedparts, textiles, and coagulant aids (American Cyanamid Company, Ex. 94:ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 12). Chronic exposure to acrylamide has been associatedwith neurotoxic effects in animals and humans; in cats, the no-effect doselevel for neurotoxic effects ranges from 0.3 to 1.0 mg/kg/day (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 12). Neuropathic effects caused by exposure to acrylamide are dose-relatedand have been seen in rats, cats, and monkeys. Observed effects in humansincluded muscular weakening, ataxia, incoordination, tremors, and hallucinations.Acrylamide can be absorbed through the skin in sufficient quantities tobe systemically toxic; the dermal LDLo in rabbits is 1000 mg/kg (RTECS1988).Tests on the mutagenicity of acrylamide have produced conflicting results(ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 12). However, acrylamide is associated with reproductiveeffects; based on a drinking water study by Smith, Zenick, Preston et al.(1986/Ex. 1-1123), OSHA concluded that acrylamide causes dominant lethalityin the male rat (53 FR 21191).Two studies are available that demonstrate the carcinogenicity of acrylamide:Johnson, Gorzinsky, Bodner et al. (1986/Ex. 1-825) and Bull, Robinson,Laurie et al. (1984/Ex. 1-252). OSHA described both of these studies inthe preamble to the proposed rule (53 FR 21191); they are briefly summarizedhere. In the Bull et al. (1984/Ex. 1-252) study, acrylamide was testedas a skin tumor initiator in female Sencar mice; 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate(TPA) was used as a promoter. The authors administered six doses rangingfrom 0 to 50 mg/kg body weight over a two-week period. A dose-related increasein tumor incidence was observed for all routes of exposure tested, includingtopical, gastric intubation, and intraperitoneal injection. The same authors(Bull, Robinson, Laurie et al. 1986/Ex. 1-252) noted a dose-related increasein lung adenomas in A/J mice administered acrylamide either by gastricintubation or intraperitoneal injection.The second study was performed by Johnson et al. (1986/Ex. 1-825) on maleand female Fischer 344 rats given 0 to 2.0 mg/kg/day acrylamide in drinkingwater for a period of two years. During the last four months of this study,mortality from cancer was observed at a statistically significant ratein rats exposed at the highest dose level; in addition, tumor incidenceincreased in animals of both sexes in the highest dose group. In females,tumors of the mammary gland, central nervous system thyroid gland, oraltissues, uterus, and clitoral gland were seen, while males developed tumorsof the central nervous system, thyroid, adrenal gland, and scrotum (Johnson,Gorzinsky, Bodner et al. 1986/Ex. 1-825). Peripheral nerve degenerationwas also seen in female rats exposed at the 2-mg/kg/day level (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 13).OSHA received comments on the proposed limit for acrylamide from NIOSHand from one other rulemaking participant. Linda Dulak, Toxicology ProgramManager for the American Cyanamid Company, submitted a detailed critiqueof OSHA's discussion (53 FR 21191) of acrylamide's carcinogenicity (Ex.94). According to Dr. Dulak: (1) The Johnson et al. (1986/Ex. 1-825) studydescribed above is ``inconclusive'' with regard to acrylamide's carcinogenicity;(2) the Bull et al. (1984/Ex. 1-252) study demonstrates only that acrylamideis not a ``complete'' carcinogen; (3) OSHA has not demonstrated that therisk of exposure to acrylamide at the former PEL of 0.3 mg/m3 is significant;and (4) OSHA has not demonstrated that it is feasible, either technologicallyor economically, to achieve the proposed 0.03-mg/m3 limit (Ex. 94). Theparagraphs below discuss each of these points in turn.Dr. Dulak believes that the results of the Johnson et al. (1986/Ex. 1-825)study should be regarded as ``inconclusive'' because (1) the presence ofa vital infection in the animals of all dose groups ``complicates the evaluationof the data''; (2) the highest dose administered was toxic to female rats;and (3) there were high background incidences of tumors among the controls(Ex. 94, p. 6). In addition, American Cyanamid states that the Bull etal. (1984/Ex. 1-252) study demonstrates only that acrylamide is not a completecarcinogen because animals administered acrylamide alone did not developskin tumors (Ex. 94, p. 8). Dr. Dulak reported that American Cyanamid iscurrently conducting a second carcinogencity study designed to clarifythe questions that arose during the Johnson et al. (1986/Ex. 1-825) study,and preliminary review suggests that these results will differ significantlyfrom those of the early study (Ex. 94, pp. 6-8). Dr. Dulak notes that theACGIH is planning to review the expanded toxicological data base for acrylamidein the fall of 1988 and that the Food and Drug Administration and the ScienceAdvisory Board of EPA are preparing to review the second American Cyanamidstudy when it becomes available (Exs. 3-961 and 8-76; Ex. 94, pp. 2-3).OSHA's response to Dr. Dulak's comments follows.First, as regards the Bull et al. (1984/Ex. 1-252) study, prudent public-healthpolicy dictates that all carcinogens, rather than only complete carcinogens,be regulated to levels that will provide worker protection. Second, OSHAnotes that the authors of the Bull et al. (1984/Ex. 1-252) study are ofthe opinion that the potency of acrylamide as a tumor initiator is equalto that of ethyl carbamate, a widely recognized tumorigen (Klaasen, Amdur,and Doull 1986/Ex. 1-99, p. 123); in addition, these authors demonstratedthat mice of a different strain (ie., A/J mice) developed lung adenomaswhen given acrylamide by gastric intubation or intraperitoneal injection.Third, OSHA finds the Bull et al. (1984/Ex. 1-252) study, which showeda dose-related increase in skin tumors in one strain of mouse by threedifferent routes of exposure and the development of lung tumors in anotherstrain of mouse by two routes of administration, convincing evidence ofacrylamide's carcinogenicity. OSHA looks forward to reviewing both theresults of American Cyanamid's second study and the ACGIH TLV Committee'scomments on acrylamide when these become available. However, the risk demonstratedby OSHA's risk assessment for acrylamide indicates that delaying regulatoryaction until additional research has been done would be inappropriate;further, it is the Agency's experience that research results are oftennot published for several years and that the deliberations of the ACGIHCommittee are often time-consuming. OSHA finds it inappropriate to delayaction when the best available evidence at present indicates a significantrisk at the former PEL. Further, OSHA notes that the ACGIH was sufficientlypersuaded of acrylamide's carcinogenicity by the findings of the Bull etal. (1984/Ex. 1-252) and Johnson et al. (1986/Ex. 1-825) studies to assignthis substance an A2 (suspected human carcinogen) designation. The InternationalAgency for Research on Cancer (IARC) was also convinced by the evidencepresented in these studies; IARC judged that the evidence for the carcinogenicityof acrylamide in animals was sufficient (IARC 1986). However, in lightof the ongoing research being conducted by American Cyanamid, OSHA willconsider new evidence as it becomes available and will revise its limitif this action appears to be warranted.In response to Dr. Dulak's third point (that, in American Cyanamid's view,OSHA has not demonstrated that risk at the former PEL of 0.3 mg/m3 is significant),OSHA points to the results of the Agency's quantitative risk assessment,which show that the maximum likelihood estimate of the risk at the formerPEL of 0.3 mg/m3 is 10 cancer deaths per 1,000 workers exposed at thatlevel over their working lifetimes (Table C15-1).<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert illustration 0 1342</ITAG>American Cyanamid believes that both the recent epidemiological findingsof Sobel, Bond, Parsons, and Brenner (1986, as cited in Ex. 94) in a cohortmortality study of Dow Chemical Company acrylamide-exposed workers andadditional results from a more recent mortality study (Collins et al. 1987/Ex.3-961) of American Cyanamid's workers show that ``acrylamide is not carcinogenicto people'' (Ex. 94, pp. 9-10).Dr. Dulak discussed the Collins et al. study (1987/Ex. 3-961, AppendixV) at length in posthearing comment:<ITAG tagnum="21">It was determined that the study was large enough to detect the increasedrisk of cancer which OSHA has indicated would occur at present exposurelimits. These findings, therefore, indicate that OSHA has overestimatedthe risk of cancer among acrylamide workers at the present PEL (Ex. 94,p. 9).</ITAG>OSHA does not agree that its quantitative risk assessment is inconsistentwith the findings of the Collins et al. (1987) study. These investigatorsreported that the average cumulative exposures (defined as mg/m\3\-years,the product of airborne concentration and duration of exposure) for eachof the four subcohort plants included in the study ranged from 0.07 to1.54 mg/m\3\-years, with an overall average of 1.0 mg/m\3\-years. Thiscumulative exposure corresponds to a 45-year exposure to 0.02 mg/m\3\;at this level of exposure, OSHA's risk assessment shows that the excesslifetime cancer risk is less than one death per 1,000 workers. Thus, atthe levels and durations of exposure experienced by the cohort studiedby Collins et al. (1987), OSHA's risk assessment suggests that only oneor two exposure-related excess cancer deaths would be expected among the2,293 exposed employees; clearly, such a small excess cancer death rate,which represents an increase of only 3 percent over background rates forall neoplasms, would not have been detected by this study. OSHA finds thatthe results presented by Collins et al. (1987) are not inconsistent withthe results of OSHA's quantitative risk assessment. OSHA therefore reaffirmsin this final rule that it is appropriate to treat acrylamide as a potentialoccupational carcinogen.In response to American Cyanamid's final point, which relates to the technologicaland economic feasibility of achieving the final rule's 0.03-mg/m\3\ 8-hourTWA level, OSHA notes the following. First, with very few exceptions, theAgency's final Regulatory Impact Assessment (Section VII) has determinedthat the controls necessary to achieve compliance with the limits proposedin this rulemaking are both technologically and economically feasible.This is clearly the case for firms, such as American Cyanamid, in the ChemicalManufacturing sector, SIC 28. Second, the EPA (1986b) study submitted byAmerican Cyanamid (Ex. 94), entitled <T3>Assessment of Airborne Exposure and Dermal Contact to Acrylamide DuringChemical Grouting Operations, </T3>showed that most worker exposures wereconsistently below the 0.03-mg/m\3\ level at the present time. Third, aNIOSH study (Hills and Greife 1986, as cited in Ex. 94) of facilities engagedin acrylamide monomer manufacturing reported considerable variability inexposure levels between the four plants surveyed; the observed variabilitywas due in part to differences in housekeeping practices, age and maintenanceof equipment, and use of engineering controls and natural dilution ventilation.NIOSH recommended that both frequent washing of the production area andventilation be used to reduce airborne exposures to acrylamide. OSHA believesthat it is technologically feasible for affected facilities to achievecompliance with the level promulgated by this final rule (see the TechnologicalFeasibility section of this preamble). The Agency is therefore settinga revised 8-hour TWA exposure limit of 0.03 mg/m\3\ for acrylamide, witha skin notation, based on the significant risk of cancer posed to workersexposed to this substance in the workplace. OSHA concludes that this effectrepresents a material impairment of health and functional capacity, andthe Agency concludes that the 0.03-mg/m\3\ PEL will substantially reducethis significant occupational risk.<ITAG tagnum="71">AMITROLE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 61-82-5; Chemical Formula: C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>4</T2>N<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1020</ITAG>OSHA had no former PEL for amitrole; the Agency proposed a TWA limit of0.2 mg/m\3\, which is also the limit recommended by the ACGIH (1986/Ex.1-3, p. 25) on the basis of positive carcinogenicity studies conductedin rats and mice. OSHA is establishing these limits in the final rule.NIOSH recommends a 10-hour TWA of 0.3 mg/m\3\ for amitrole, which is acrystalline solid; however, NIOSH specifically concurred with the limitfor this substance being established by the final rule (Ex. 8-47, TableN6A). Amitrole is used as a herbicide and plant growth regulator.Amitrole is a potent antithyroid agent and has been shown to cause tumors,particularly of the thyroid and pituitary glands, in experimental animals(ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 25). Its tumor-producing activity is thought tobe related to its goitrogenic effects, which cause an increase in thyroid-stimulatinghormone (TSH). Other antithyroid agents that cause TSH stimulation, suchas propylthiouracil, have also been shown to produce thyroid tumors (Guyton1981/Ex. 1-1002). Amitrole has not been shown to be mutagenic in the Amesbacterial mutation assay, a dominant lethal test in male mice, or in assaysthat measure recessive sex-linked lethal mutations in <T3>Drosophila melanogaster </T3>(ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 25).An excess incidence of tumors has been reported to occur among pesticideworkers exposed to amitrole alone or in combination with phenoxy herbicides.Although these studies indicate the possible association of increased tumorincidence with exposure to amitrole, confounding factors, such as smokingand concurrent exposure to other pesticides, complicate the interpretationof these data. The Swedish National Board of Occupational Safety and Health ordered anepidemiological evaluation to assess the incidence of cancer among railroadworkers exposed to herbicides (Axelson and Sundell 1974/Ex. 1-812). Amitrolewas among the pesticides utilized by these workers. Cohorts were separatedinto groups according to whether they were exposed to amitrole and combinationsof other herbicides, phenoxy acids and combinations of other herbicides,or other herbicides alone. A statistically significant increase in theincidence of total tumors and lung tumors was found among workers exposedto amitrole and combinations of other herbicides. Smoking frequency amongmembers of this group was reported to be similar to the frequency of smokingin the general Swedish population. In a 1980 follow-up to the Axelson and Sundell (1974/Ex. 1-812) study,Axelson and co-workers (Ex. 1-242) combined data from the earlier studywith data on workers exposed from 1972 to 1978. Cohorts were divided intothe following exposure groups: amitrole alone, phenoxy acids alone, andamitrole and phenoxy acids combined. The reanalyzed data did not show astatistically significant increase in cancer incidence among the workersexposed to amitrole alone; however, the incidence of tumors among workersexposed to amitrole and phenoxy acids together was significantly increased(Axelson, Sundell, Andersson et al. 1980/Ex. 1-242). Amitrole has been found to be carcinogenic in laboratory animals followingdietary exposure to relatively high doses. Attempts to induce tumors bydermal application and subcutaneous injection have been unsuccessful. Studiesinvestigating the carcinogenic potential of amitrole in laboratory animalsare reviewed below. The effects of lifetime exposure to amitrole were investigated in rats,mice, and hamsters fed diets containing 1, 10, or 100 ppm amitrole (Steinhoff,Weber, Mohr, and Boehme 1983/Ex. 1-208). There was a significant increasein the incidence of thyroid tumors in male and female rats and in the incidenceof pituitary tumors in female rats exposed to 100 ppm. An excess incidenceof tumors was not found in male or female rats exposed to 1 or 10 ppm.The results of this experiment are presented in Table C15-3. Tumor inductionwas not observed in male or female mice or hamsters. Another study reportednegative results for rats fed diets containing 10, 50, or 100 ppm amitrole(Jukes and Schaffer 1960/Ex. 1-213). Dermal applications of 0.1 or 10 mg of amitrole produced no increased incidenceof tumors in mice (IARC 1982a/Ex. 1-1112). In contrast to the negative results obtained in mice following lifetimedietary exposure to 1, 10, or 100 ppm amitrole (Steinhoff, Weber, Mohr,and Boehme 1983/Ex. 1-208), positive results were observed in male andfemale mice following dietary exposure to higher levels (2192 ppm) of amitrolefor one year (Innes, Ulland, Valerio et al. 1969/Ex. 1-270). Carcinomasof the thyroid were observed in 89 percent (64/72) of the exposed animals(tumor incidence in controls was not reported). <G/><ITAG tagnum="7">insert illus 0 1349A </ITAG>Positive results were also observed in mice exposed to 1 percent (10,000ppm) amitrole in the diet in a lifetime study (exposure for four weeksfollowed by one week with no exposure) (Feinstein, Fry, and Staffeld 1978a/Ex.1-281). Liver tumors developed in 100 percent of the exposed mice; however,the incidence of tumors in unexposed controls was not reported. A smallnumber of thyroid tumors was also reported. The authors hypothesized thatthe reason more thyroid tumors were not seen was because the animals diedof the high toxic doses before such tumors were expressed.Chronic dietary administration of amitrole in dogs (10, 50, 100, or 500ppm) and in rainbow trout (1200 or 4800 ppm) did not result in the developmentof tumors (IARC 1982a/Ex. 1-1112), but these experiments were not longenough to allow for evaluation of the carcinogenicity of the chemical.<T3>Risk estimate for amitrole. </T3>The study by Steinhoff et al. (1983/Ex.1-208) provides sufficient information to estimate quantitatively the excesscancer risk associated with exposure to amitrole in the workplace. Thelinearized multistage model was chosen to estimate risk. The incidenceof malignant thyroid tumors in female rats was used because these tumorsdemonstrate a clear monotonic response. Female rats were assumed to weigh250 g and to consume 25 g of food per day. Human risks were estimated atexposure levels corresponding to the proposed PEL of 0.2 mg/m\3\, as wellas for exposure levels of 0.4 mg/m\3\ and 1.0 mg/m\3\. OSHA has revisedthe risk estimates presented in the NPRM on amitrole to correct an overestimatein the calculation of lifetime dose (Ex. 110). The revised excess estimatedcancer risk, in terms of excess deaths per 1,000 employees is shown inTable C15-4.<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert illus 1351A</ITAG>Exposure to 0.2 mg/m\3\ of amitrole for an occupational lifetime (45 years)is associated with an estimated 3 excess cancer deaths per 1,000 employees(0.3 percent). This rate is based on the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE).The 95-percent upper-bound estimate of risk corresponding to this doseis about 4 excess cancer deaths per 1,000 workers. By comparison, the maximumlikelihood estimates of risk for lifetime exposure to 0.4 mg/m\3\ or 1.0mg/m\3\ are 5 or 13 excess deaths per 1,000 employees, respectively.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A) concurred with OSHA's 0.2-mg/m\3\ TWA limitfor amitrole. Two other rulemaking participants commented on OSHA's assessment(Ex. 3-894; Tr. pp. 3-13 to 3-14). The American Industrial Health Council(AIHC) (Ex. 3-894) urged OSHA to use a different risk assessment procedurefor amitrole that incorporates information on the mechanism by which amitroleinduces thyroid tumors:<ITAG tagnum="21">Where, as in the case of amitrole, the data indicate that the tumorsin the experimental animals are in endocrine sensitive tissue and the mechanismis a secondary hormonal action, a risk assessment procedure incorporatingthese mechanistic data should be used (Ex. 3-894, p.

In fact, theEPA has proposed using a new threshold risk assessment method for evaluatingthyroid carcinogens (Tr. pp. 3-13 to 3-14). </ITAG>OSHA recognizes the possibility that a threshold effect level may existfor the development of tumors induced by this special class of substancesthat act on endocrine-sensitive tissues. OSHA notes that EPA's preliminaryfindings and proposed threshold risk assessment model are still under reviewby the Science Advisory Board, and the Agency eagerly awaits EPA's finalconclusions on this issue. OSHA points out, however, that amitrole hasproduced liver tumors in mice (Innes, Ulland, Valerio et al. 1969/Ex. 1-270;Feinstein, Fry, and Staffeld 1978a/Ex. 1-281) andimum likelihood estimate(MLE). The 95-percent upper-bound estimate of risk corresponding to thisdose is about 4 excess cancer deaths per 1,000 workers. By comparison,the maximum likelihood estimates of risk for lifetime exposure to 0.4 mg/m\3\or 1.0 mg/m\3\ are 5 or 13 excess deaths per 1,000 employees, respectively.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A) concurred with OSHA's 0.2-mg/m\3\ TWA limitfor amitrole.

OSHA notes that EPA's preliminaryfindings and proposed threshold risk assessment model are still under reviewby the Science Advisory Board, and the Agency eagerly awaits EPA's finalconclusions on this issue. OSHA points out, however, that amitrole hasproduced liver tumors in mice (Innes, Ulland, Valerio et al. 1969/Ex. 1-270;Feinstein, Fry, and Staffeld 1978a/Ex. 1-281) and, in one instance (Feinstein,Fry, and Staffeld 1978a/Ex. 1-281), the liver tumors appeared at an earlierage and at a higher incidence than did thyroid tumors. It is not clearfrom the present data that the mechanism for the development of these livertumors is the same as that for thyroid tumors. OSHA also notes that theproposed 0.2-mg/m\3\ PEL is, according to the ACGIH's calculations, onlya factor of 10 lower than the demonstrated effect level for amitrole-inducedeffects of thyroid function; even assuming that amitrole-induced carcinogenesisfollows a dose-threshold pattern, use of a tenfold safety margin when therisk involved is related to a disease as serious as cancer cannot be viewedas unreasonable. Occupational exposure to amitrole has been shown to be associated withan increased incidence of thyroid and pituitary tumors in experimentalanimals. Although human studies have not demonstrated conclusively thatamitrole is carcinogenic, the studies by Axelson and Sundell (1974/Ex.1-812) and Axelson, Sundell, Andersson et al. (1980/Ex. 1-242) provideevidence that amitrole may increase the risk of cancer among exposed workers.The Agency concludes that the adverse effects resulting from exposure toamitrole constitute material impairment of health and functional capacity.OSHA's risk assessment, based on the animal data, shows that this significantexcess cancer risk can be substantially reduced for employees who are currentlyexposed above the final rule's 0.2-mg/m\3\ limit. Therefore, OSHA is establishinga 0.2-mg/m\3\ TWA exposure limit for amitrole. <ITAG tagnum="71">ASPHALT FUMES </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 8052-42-4; Chemical formula: None </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Extensive evidence was submitted to the record regarding the proposed PELfor asphalt fume. Because of the conflicting nature of some of the evidenceand the complexity of the issues raised, OSHA has not yet been able toreach a final conclusion. Therefore, OSHA is temporarily delaying a finaldecision regarding the establishment of a separate PEL for asphalt fume;however, OSHA will make this final decision in a reasonable period of time.<ITAG tagnum="71">BERYLLIUM AND COMPOUNDS </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS No.: 7440-41-7 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

OSHAis retaining these limits in the final rule. The ACGIH has a TLV-TWA forberyllium of 0.002 mg/m\3\. NIOSH (1977o; Baier 1977b/Ex. 1-831) recommendsa ceiling limit of 0.5 ug/m\3\ (0.0005 mg/m\3\). Beryllium is a hard, brittle,gray-white metal. The ACGIH recommendation is based on human evidence describing nonmalignantrespiratory disease and berylliosis associated with exposure to beryllium.Because of the uncertainty regarding the concentrations of beryllium necessaryto produce chronic respiratory disease, and because of the serious natureof the disease, the ACGIH set a TLV-TWA of 0.002 mg/m\3\. At the time of publication of NIOSH's criteria document on beryllium (NIOSH1972a, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 56), NIOSH judged the evidenceon beryllium-related cancer to be equivocal. In testimony at OSHA's 1977hearing on a standard for beryllium, however, NIOSH presented additionalepidemiologic and animal evidence indicating that beryllium is carcinogenic.In particular, NIOSH (1977o; Baier 1977b/Ex. 1-831) cited the studies ofBayliss and Wagoner (1977) and Mancuso (1977), which showed significantincreases in bronchogenic cancer among beryllium-exposed workers. NIOSHtherefore recommended at the 1977 hearing that exposure to beryllium notexceed the reliable limit of detection of 0.5 ug/m\3\ (NIOSH 1977o; Baier1977b/Ex. 1-831). George M. Talley and Michael C. Garcia, Industrial Hygienists for the LosAlamos National Laboratory (Ex. 3-1095), commented that beryllium shouldnot be included in the group of potential carcinogens in this rulemakingbecause OSHA is not revising its limits for beryllium on the basis of carcinogenicity.As discussed in other sections of this preamble, OSHA's classificationof substances in this preamble is not meant to have regulatory implicationsbut to facilitate generic rulemaking. OSHA also notes, as do Mr. Talleyand Mr. Garcia, that the ACGIH has designated beryllium as a potential(A2) human carcinogen. Representatives of the International Chemical Workers Union (Tr. p. 9-217)and the AFL-CIO (Ex. 194) urged OSHA to issue a standard for berylliumbased on the NIOSH REL. As explained in the proposal and in Section IIIof this preamble, however, OSHA has used its priority-setting authorityto focus this rulemaking on substances selected for inclusion on the basisof certain decision rules. Beryllium is a substance with an extensive rulemakinghistory, in that OSHA has previously issued an NPRM and developed an extensiverecord for beryllium. The Agency determined that, because of this extensiveprior history, beryllium presents issues that are too complex for a decisionat this time. The ACGIH TLV of 0.002 mg/m3 (TWA) was judged in the NPRM to be less stringentthan OSHA's existing PELs. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B) did not concur withOSHA's proposal to retain the existing PELs. As OSHA explained in the NPRM,the NIOSH REL is based on analytical and sampling limits of detection,an approach to limit-setting that does not necessarily satisfy OSHA's requirementsregarding significant risk and feasibility. In the final rule, OSHA isretaining the Agency's PELs of 0.002 mg/m3 TWA, 0.005 mg/m3 as a 30-minuteSTEL, and 0.025 mg/m3 as a ceiling for beryllium and compounds. <ITAG tagnum="71">CARBON TETRACHLORIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 56-23-5; Chemical Formula: CC1<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

Carbon tetrachloride is classifiedas a probable human carcinogen by EPA (Group B2) and IARC (Group 2B), andas a suspected human carcinogen by the ACGIH (Category A2), based on positivecarcinogenicity studies in rats, mice, and hamsters. In the final rule,OSHA is establishing a 2-ppm 8-hour TWA limit for carbon tetrachloride.Carbon tetrachloride is a heavy, mobile liquid with a sweet odor. In humans, there have been three case reports of liver tumors developingafter carbon tetrachloride exposure (Tracy and Sherlock 1968/Ex. 1-152;Johnstone 1948/Ex. 1-817; Simler, Maurer, and Mandard 1964/Ex. 1-225).In each case, the patient has been acutely overexposed to carbon tetracholoride,leading to nausea, stomach pains, and signs of severe liver damage. Blair, Decoufle, and Grauman (1979/Ex. 1-150) studied causes of death in330 laundry and dry cleaning workers potentially exposed to carbon tetrachloride,as well as to trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. Causes of deathbased on death certificates were compared to the age, sex, race, and cause-specificdistribution of U.S. deaths from the same time period. The proportionatemortality ratio (PMR) for all malignant neoplasms was 128, which was statisticallysignificant, indicating that the study group had a 28-percent higher proportionof total deaths due to cancer compared with the U.S. general population.The excess cancer deaths were due to liver, lung, and cervical cancer andleukemia. Although the excess lung and cervical cancer may reflect socioeconomicdifferences among these workers, the excess liver cancer seen in this studyis consistent with findings in animal studies on carbon tetrachloride.In animals, carbon tetrachloride has produced hepatocellular carcinomasin all species evaluated (rats, mice, and hamsters). Male rats were given47 or 94 mg/kg carbon tetrachloride and females were given 80 or 159 mg/kgby gavage for 78 weeks (NCI 1976a/Ex. 1-119; NCI 1976b/Ex. 1-168; NCI 1977b/Ex.1-169). The incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas was increased in animalsexposed to carbon tetrachloride as compared with pooled colony controlsbut was statistically significant only for low-dose females. The lowerincidence of carcinomas in female rats at the high dose (1/49) comparedto the low dose (4/49) was attributed by the authors to the increased lethalitythat occurred among these rats before tumors could be expressed.In this same study, mice of both sexes received 1250 or 2500 mg/kg carbontetrachloride by gavage. Hepatocellular carcinomas were found in 49/49low-dose and 47/48 high-dose males (compared with 5/77 in the control males)and in 40/40 low-dose and 43/45 high-dose females (compared with 1/80 inthe control females) (NCI 1976a/Ex. 1-119; NCI 1976b/Ex. 1-168; NCI 1977b/Ex.1-169).Edwards, Heston, and Dalton (1942/Ex. 1-68) administered carbon tetrachlorideby gavage (64 mg/mouse administered 46 times over four months) to a mousestrain known to have a low incidence of spontaneous hepatomas. The incidenceof hepatomas was 52 percent (28/54) for males and 32 percent (6/19) forfemales. Previous hepatoma incidence data for untreated mice of this strainwere 2/71 for males and 0/81 for females. Carbon tetrachloride administeredby gavage has also been shown to produce neoplastic changes in the liversof four additional strains of mice (Andervont 1958/Ex. 1-81; Edwards 1941/Ex. 1-86; Eschenbrenner and Miller 1943/Ex. 1-113).Della Porta, Terracini, and Shubik (1961/Ex. 1-136) gave weekly gavagetreatments of 10 to 20 ug to hamsters for 30 weeks, and the animals wereobserved for an additional 25 weeks. All 10 hamsters dying or killed betweenweeks 43 and 55 had liver cell carcinomas, in comparison with 0/254 inhistorical controls.<T3>Risk estimate for carbon tetrachloride. </T3>Three data sets have sufficientdose-response information to allow quantitative risk estimation: the ratand mouse bioassay data (NCI 1976a/Ex. 1-119; NCI 1976b/Ex. 1-168; NCI1977b/Ex. 1-169) and the Edwards, Heston, and Dalton (1942/Ex. 1-68) mousedata. To increase sample sizes, the data were pooled for male and femaleanimals in each of the three studies. (In the NPRM, OSHA erroneously indicatedthat four data sets were pooled; see Ex. 110.) The estimated risk presentedin Table C15-5 is the geometric mean of the risk calculated from each ofthe three data sets. <G/><ITAG tagnum="7">insert illus 1361A</ITAG>Inhalation risk was calculated assuming an air intake of 20 m\3\ per 24-hourday and a 40-percent absorption rate for humans (EPA 1984a/Ex. 1-1130).All four studies suggest that a common biological mechanism, cell deathand regeneration, occurs and leads to the development of the same tumortype.Table C15-5 presents the estimates of lifetime human risk from carbon tetrachlorideexposure, calculated by the linearized multistage model (GLOBAL83), atthe final rule's 2-ppm limit, the ACGIH limit of 5 ppm, and the former10-ppm OSHA PEL. Both the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) and the (95-percentupper-confidence limits of human risk are given, as well as the correspondingexpected number of excess cancer deaths per 1,000 workers exposed overa working lifetime. Based on this risk estimate, the MLE at the former OSHA limit of 10 ppmis 17.9 excess deaths per 1,000 exposed workers, clearly indicating thata significant cancer risk exists at the former PEL.Risk at the current ACGIH limit of 5 ppm is estimated to be 9.2 excessdeaths per 1,000 workers exposed over their working lifetimes. At the finalrule's limit of 2 ppm, residual risk continues to be significant, accordingto the Supreme Court's guidance in the <T3>Benzene </T3>decision and the analysis presented in the introductionto this section; the risk predicted at 2 ppm is 3.7 excess deaths per 1,000workers exposed over their working lifetimes. However, risk at the 2-ppmlimit is substantially reduced compared with risk at the former OSHA PELof 10 ppm. The estimate shows that approximately 14 cancer deaths per 1,000workers would potentially be avoided over a lifetime by reducing the limitto 2 ppm.Both NIOSH (Ex. 193) and the AFL-CIO (Ex. 194) supported OSHA's proposed2-ppm 60-minute ceiling PEL and believed that carbon tetrachloride shouldbe designated as a potential carcinogen. The Dow Chemical Company (Ex.3-741), however, stated that, for a number of reasons, it believes thatthe cancer risk from exposure to carbon tetrachloride has been overestimated.First, Dow argues that carbon tetrachloride enhances the occurrence ofnaturally forming liver tumors by causing increased cell death and turnover.Because clear threshold effect levels have been demonstrated for livertoxicity, Dow believes that a threshold-type response would be expectedfor carcinogenic effects ``since liver toxicity appears to be a precursorto carcinogenic activity'' (Ex. 3-741, p. 34). The Halogenated SolventsIndustry Alliance (Ex. 8-89) also expressed the opinion that OSHA overstatedthe potential cancer risk by using a linear, threshold model. Dow (Ex.3-741) concludes that a level of 50 ppm (the threshold for liver toxicityobserved in six-month inhalation studies in monkeys) represents the thresholdconcentration for human toxicity and carcinogenicity from exposure to carbontetrachloride.In support of its position, Dow included a review of toxicity data by J.M.Norris of Dow Chemical (Ex. 3-741, Appendix A). Mr. Norris cites studiesthat suggest that species sensitivity to liver toxicity is related to cytochromeP-450 content in liver and that rodents have greater unit P-450 activityand are more sensitive to carbon tetrachloride-induced liver toxicity thanare Rhesus monkeys. Since the unit P-450 activity of Rhesus monkeys iscomparable to that of humans, Mr. Norris concludes that ``the monkey maybe the appropriate animal for extrapolation to man'' (Ex. 3-741, AppendixA, p. 10).After reviewing the evidence presented by Mr. Norris, OSHA is unpersuadedthat the 50-ppm no-effect level observed in monkeys should be used to establisha PEL to protect workers from the significant cancer risk associated withexposure to carbon tetrachloride. The monkey data cited by Dow and Mr.Norris are results from a study of only six months' duration, and onlyone or two monkeys were tested at dose levels near the no-observed-effectlevel. Mr. Norris acknowledged that these limitations warrant the use ofa safety factor to derive an adequate exposure limit; applying an appropriatesafety factor to the 50-ppm NOEL would yield a PEL no higher, and perhapswell below, the final rule's 2-ppm limit, given the seriousness of thetoxicologic endpoint (carcinogenicity). OSHA concludes that the approachit has used to assess cancer risk (i.e., combining data from several animalstudies to estimate risk with a widely used dose-response model) providesbetter information on which to base a revised PEL than do the results ofa single short-term, small-sample animal study.Based on the evidence presented above and the quantitative estimates ofcarbon tetrachloride-related cancer risk, OSHA concludes that occupationalexposure to carbon tetrachloride at the former 10-ppm PEL presents a significantrisk of cancer to workers (13.9 cancer deaths per 1,000 workers). OSHA'srisk assessment shows that reducing this limit to 2 ppm will substantiallyreduce this risk (3.7 deaths per 1,000 workers). The Agency concludes thatcancer represents a material impairment of health and functional capacity.Accordingly, OSHA is revising its limits for carbon tetrachloride to asingle limit of 2 ppm; however, in the final rule, OSHA is establishingthis limit as an 8-hour TWA. OSHA has determined that a TWA limit is moreappropriate for carbon tetrachloride since low-level exposure to carbontetrachloride presents a chronic, rather than an acute, health hazard.OSHA also believes that establishing a TWA limit will simplify the developmentof compliance and exposure monitoring strategies for employers, since an8-hour TWA limit is more conventional than a 60-minute limit. Therefore,in the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 2-ppm 8-hour TWA PEL for carbontetrachloride.<ITAG tagnum="71">CHLOROFORM</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 67-66-3; Chemical Formula: CHCl<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1086</ITAG>The former OSHA PEL for chloroform was 50 ppm as a ceiling limit. OSHAproposed to revise this limit to 2 ppm, measured over a 60-minute period.This limit was based on the NIOSH (1977p, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 130) REL, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A) has indicated its concurrencewith the proposed limit. In the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 2-ppmlimit for chloroform, but is expressing this PEL as an 8-hour TWA limit.The ACGIH has established a TLV-TWA of 10 ppm and assigned chloroform anA2 designation. Chloroform is a clear, colorless, nonflammable, volatileliquid with a pleasant odor.Chloroform is considered by the ACGIH, the United States EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA), and the International Agency for Research on Cancer(IARC) as a probable carcinogen in humans. Chloroform is given an overallweight-of-evidence classification of B2 by the EPA and a classificationof 2B by IARC. These classifications are based on these organization'sdetermination that there is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicityof chloroform in animals and insufficient evidence in humans. The followingdiscussion is based on information from the EPA <T3>Health Assessment Document for Chloroform </T3>(EPA 1984f/Ex.1-216)./It is currently believed that the carcinogenicity of chloroform resultsfrom the formation of reactive metabolites, such as phosgene, that bindto cellular macromolecules. Although there is some evidence to suggestthat chloroform is weakly mutagenic, the results of most mutagenicity testsare negative. In humans, there are no epidemiological studies that evaluate populationsexposed only to chloroform, although there are several studies that examinepopulations exposed to chloroform in chlorinated drinking water. However,because chloroform is not the only potential carcinogen present in chlorinatedwater, the epidemiological data are considered inadequate to use as thebasis for a quantitative risk assessment. Thus, a causal relationship betweencancer and chloroform exposure cannot be determined based on epidemiologicalstudies alone, although these studies can be used to provide general supportfor findings in animal studies. A case-controlled study indicated a significant association between coloncancer and exposure to chlorinated drinking water contaminated with organicmaterial (Young, Kanarek, and Tsiatis 1981/Ex. 1-118). Significant positiveassociations were also found for chloroform levels in drinking water andthe incidence of morality due to cancer of the bladder, rectum, and largeintestine (Hogan, Chi, Hoel, and Mitchell 1979/Ex. 1-159). Similar resultsalso have been found by others (Cantor, Hoover, Mason, and McCabe 1978/Ex.1-50;and Gottlieb, Carr, and Morris 1981/Ex. 1-72). However, although thesestudies suggest an association between exposure to chloroform and an increasedrisk of cancer, a definite causal relationship between the developmentof colon and bladder cancer and exposure to chloroform cannot be determinedsolely from these studies. In animals, several long-term studies provide strong evidence for the carcinogenicactivity of chloroform. Chloroform has been shown to produce statisticallysignificant increases in renal epithelial tumors in male rats and hepatocelluluarcarcinomas in several strains of mice. The carcinogenic activity of chloroformin these studies is specific to the kidney and liver. The carinogenic activity of chloroform was investigated in rates exposedto chloroform by gavage for 78 weeks (NCI 1976a/Ex. 1-119). Male rats wereadministered doses of 90 or 180 mg/kg/day, and female rats were administereddoses of 100 or 200 mg/kg/day. A statistically significant dose-relatedincrease in renal epithelial tumors was observed in treated male rats comparedwith untreated, matched controls; these tumors were described as carcinomasand adenomas. No increase in the incidence of tumors was observed in chloroform-treatedfemale rats. In this same study, the carcinogenicity of chloroform was evaluated inmice exposed chronically to chloroform by gavage (NCI 1976a/Ex. 1-119).Male mice were exposed to doses of 138 or 277 mg/kg/day and females to238 or 477 mg/kg/day for 78 weeks. There were significant dose-relatedincreases in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in chloroform-treatedmale and female mice. The increase of tumors in male mice for low and highdoses was 36 percent and 98 percent, respectively. For female mice, theincreases were 80 percent for the low dose and 95 percent for the highdose of chloroform.  The carcinogenic potential of chloroform in mice was further investigatedin two additional studies (Roe, Palmer, and Worden 1979/Ex. 1-108; Jorgenson,Meierhenry, Rushbrook et al. 1985/Ex. 1-117). Doses of 17, 60, or 100 mg/kg/daywere administered to four different strains of male and female mice (C57BL,CBA, CF/1, and ICI) by gavage for 80 weeks (Roe, Palmer, and Worden 1979/Ex.1-108).The incidence of kidney tumors, described as hypernephromas, was significantlyelevated in the ICI strains. Moderate to severe renal changes were observedin the male mice of the other strains, but no significant increase in renaltumors was reported. Tumors were not observed in female mice. The carcinogenicity of chloroform administered in drinking water was investigatedin male rats and female mice (Jorgenson, Meierhenry, Rushbrook et al. 1985/Ex.1-117). Animals were treated with drinking water containing chloroformconcentrations of 200, 400, 900, or 1800 mg/L for 104 weeks. There wasa marked increase in the number of kidney tumors (described as tubularcell adenomas and adenocarcinomas) in rats. However, the incidence of tumorsin female mice was not signficantly increased. <T3>Risk estimate for chloroform. </T3>The Jorgenson et al. (1985/Ex. 1-117)rat study, which demonstrated a statistically significant increase in theincidence of renal tumors in male rats, was the data set used for the quantitativerisk estimation. (In the NPRM, OSHA inadvertently identified the NCI (1976a/Ex.1-119) study as forming the basis for risk assessment; see Ex. 110.) Althoughthere are no data concerning the carcinogenicity of chloroform followinginhalation exposure, the risk from inhaled chloroform is considered tobe equivalent to the risk from ingested chloroform. The linearized multistage,one hit, and Weibull models were used. The maximum likelihood estimatesof excess cancers over an occupational lifetime for a population of 1,000and the 95-percent upper-bound estimates are summarized in Table C15/6.The Weibull model is similar to the logit and probit models. However, byusing only one data set, the logit, probit, and multihit models failedto converge.<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert Illus. 0 1371A</ITAG>The results of the data analysis presented here are similar to the resultsof other models described by the EPA (1984f/Ex. 1-216) for chloroform.These three models clearly demonstrate, based on the MLE estimates, thata significant cancer risk exists at the former PEL of 50 ppm. The risksestimated to exist at the former PEL are of the same order of magnitudeas the risks determined by OSHA to be associated with other carcinogensthat OSHA has regulated (e.g., benzene, ethylene oxide). Some commenters(Exs. 3-685, 3-741, 3-958, 8-89, and L3-1262) stated that OSHA's risk assessmentapproach for chloroform overstated the risk by not accounting for certainaspects of the mechanism by which chloroform induces cancer. Dow Chemical(Ex. 3-741, p. 45), Hoffmann-LaRoche (Ex. L3-1262), and the American PaperInstitute (Ex. 3-685) presented evidence that the mouse liver tumors resultingfrom chloroform exposure arise secondarily to organ toxicity, which isa threshold phenomenon. As such, they argue that the use of linearized,non-threshold model will overstate cancer risk. Theodore J. Berger, AssistantVice President and Director of Corporate Environmental and Safety Affairsat Hoffmann-LaRoche, pointed out that the ACIGH TLV of 10 ppm for chloroformwas based on this consideration, and that the 10-ppm level was one-fifththe level at which organ injury has been observed (in rats). On the issue of the carcinogenic mechanism of chloroform, rulemaking participants(Exs. 3-685, 3-341, and L3-1262) and the EPA (1984f/Ex. 1-216) cite evidencethat suggest that increased cell death brought about by the formation ofreactive metabolities may be one mechanism by which chloroform has causedcancer in animals, particularly in the liver. The EPA (1984f/Ex. 1-216)also cites evidence that chloroform metabolites may deplete glutahione,which results in less effective cellular detoxification. In addition, agenotoxic mechanism cannot be entirely ruled out, although the data areequivocal; chloroform has produced positive results in the micronucleustest and host-mediated mutagenicity assay in the mouse; mutations in yeast;abnormal sperm morphology in mice; and sister chromatid exchange in humanlymphocytes and mouse marrow (EPA 1984f/Ex. 1-216). Richard Bull commented on EPA's 1984 <T3>Health Assessment Document on Chloroform </T3>(1984f/Ex. 1-216) onbehalf of the American Paper Institute (Ex. 3-685, Appedix B). AlthoughDr. Bull concluded that chloroform produces liver tumors in mice by causingorgan toxicity and cell damage, he also states that this mechanism didnot necessarily explain the kidney tumors observed in rats: <ITAG tagnum="21">[T]here is strong evidence that chloroform acts by producing celldamage in the already initiated liver of B6C3F1 mice. There is a similarcase to the made in terms of renal tumors in ICI mice. A less convincingcase can be made in the Osborne-Mendel rat, since there is no data to indicatea relationship between renal damage and carcinogenic response in this strain.In addition, there is no evidence that there are spontaneously initiatedcells in the kidney of this strain of rat. The Jorgenson et al. (1985/Ex.1-117)study indicated that the spontaneous rate for renal tubular adenomas andadenocarcinomas was 4/301 animals or slightly more than 1 percent (Ex.3-685, Appendix B, p. 8). </ITAG>Dr. Bull also stated that an ``an acceptable conservative approach [forassessing cancer risk for chloroform] would be to utilize the multistagemodel on the development of renal tumors in the rat because the case hasyet to be made that nongenotoxic mechanisms may have been involved in theinduction of these tumors * * *'' (Ex. 3-685, Appendix B; Ex. 1-0000, p.8). Thus, based on the evidence presented by EPA (1984f/Ex. 1-216) andthe comments on EPA's document by Dr. Bull, OSHA concludes that its useof the Jorgenson et al. (1985/Ex. 1-117) rat kidney data and multistagemodel is a reasonable approach for estimating the risk of cancer associatedwith exposure to chloroform. Furthermore, OSHA concludes that, even ifone were to accept both that chloroform increases cancer risk via a cell-deathmechanism, and that a threshold does for this effect exists, the 10-ppmTLV recommended by the ACIGH provides an inadequate margin (fivefold) ofprotection against this life-threatening disease. Dow Chemical Company (Ex. 3-741) and the American Paper Institute (Ex.3-685) also commented that, because humans metabolize chloroform to a lesserdegree than do rodents, quantitative risk assessments should consider suchdifferences. Dow submitted a discussion (Ex. 3-958) of the preliminaryresults of an assessment based on the use of a physiologically based pharmacokineticmodel (PB-PK) similar to that developed by Andersen et al. (1987) for methylenechloride. In this assessment, the researchers reported that the estimatedcancer risk for chloroform was one to two orders of magnitude lower thanthe risks estimated using the multistage model. However, since this workis currently underway, details of the assessment are not available. Dow Chemical also applied EPA's (1984f/Ex. 1-216) approach to the rat datafrom the Jorgenson et al. (1985/Ex. 1-117) study (Ex. 3-741, pp. 45-47).This approach uses metabolic data to express the active dose in units ofaverage mg metabolite produced per day per liter of tissue; this methodcontrasts with OSHA's approach of using applied dose for the risk assessment.Dow's MLE estimate of lifetime occupational cancer risk associated withexposure to 2 ppm is 0.17 deaths per 1,000 workers (upper-confidence limitof 0.46/1,000), based on the amount of chloroform metabolized per unitvolume of kidney tissue. The estimate based on chloroform metabolism inthe liver is 0.27/1,000 (upper-confidence limit of 0.74/1,000). OSHA doesnot believe that these estimates, which account for interspecies differencesin chloroform metabolism, are substantially different from OSHA's estimates,which are based on the use of applied dose; Dow's MLE estimate based onmetabolism in the kidney is not quite half of OSHA's MLE estimate, andDow's MLE estimate based on liver metabolism is the same as OSHA's. Thesefindings give OSHA greater confidence in the estimates of chloroform-relatedcancer risk presented in Table C15-6 above.The AFL-CIO (Ex. 194) supported OSHA's proposed PEL for chloroform. However,the New Jersey Department of Public Health (Ex. 144) urged OSHA to seta limit for chloroform based on EPA's IRIS data. The use of such an approachfor setting exposure limits is discussed in Section VI.A of the preamble.Based on the evidence presented above, OSHA concludes that a significantrisk of cancer, which OSHA considers a material impairment of health andfunctional capacity, exists at the former PEL of 50 ppm, with estimatedrisks ranging from 22 to 34 excess deaths per 1,000 workers. The SupremeCourt indicates that a reasonable person ``might well consider a risk of1.0 per 1,000 significant, and take steps to decrease or eliminate thatrisk'' (<T3>I.U.D.</T3> v. <T3>A.P.I.,</T3> 448 U.S. 655) (see the discussion in Section VI.A of thispreamble). Based on OSHA's risk assessment, significant risk of cancerremains at the ACGIH TLV of 10 ppm (1.6 deaths per 1,000 workers). OSHAalso finds that revising the PEL to 2 ppm will substantially reduce thisrisk by from 96 to 99 percent. Therefore, OSHA is establishing a 2-ppmlimit as the PEL for chloroform. However, in the final rule, OSHA is establishingthis limit as an 8-hour TWA limit, rather than a 60-minute limit as proposed.OSHA has determined that a TWA limit is more appropriate for chloroformsince low-level exposure to chloroform presents a chronic, rather thanacute, health hazard. OSHA also believes that establishing a TWA limitwill simplify the development of compliance and exposure-monitoring strategiesfor employers, since an 8-hour TWA limit is more conventional than a 60-minutelimit. Therefore, in the final rule, OSHA is establishing a 2-ppm 8-hourTWA PEL for chloroform.<ITAG tagnum="71">CHROMIC ACID, CHROMATES; ZINC CHROMATES</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: Varies with compound</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1092; 1436</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for chromic acid and chromates is a ceiling limitof 0.1 mg/m3 measured as CrO<T2>3</T2>. The Agency did not propose to revise this limit. The ACGIHhas established a TLV-TWA of 0.05 mg/m3 as Cr(VI) for both the solubleand insoluble forms of chromate (except zinc chromate), and has designatedinsoluble chromates as confirmed human carcinogens (A1). (It should benoted that the 0.05-mg/m3 limit, expressed as Cr(VI), approximates 0.01mg/m3 measured as CrO<T2/>.) NIOSH (1975b/Ex. 1-258) has recommended that exposure to thenoncarcinogenic forms of chromium (VI) be limited to 0.025 mg Cr(VI)/m3as a 10-hour TWA and 0.05 mg Cr(VI)/m3 as a 15-minute ceiling. For thecarcinogenic (i.e., insoluble) forms of chromium (VI), NIOSH recommendsa 10-hour TWA limit of 0.001 mg Cr(VI)/m3.The ACGIH recommendation for both soluble (noncarcinogenic) and insoluble(carcinogenic) forms of Cr(VI) is based largely on reports by Bloomfieldand Blum (1928/Ex. 1-822) and by the Federal Security Agency of the U.S.Public Health Service (Federal Security Agency 1953, as cited in ACGIH1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 140) that demonstrate nasal irritation and some evidenceof liver enlargement and kidney dysfunction among chromate workers exposedto 0.06 to 0.07 mg Cr(VI)/m3. The ACGIH also cites a report by Mancusoand Hueper (1951/Ex. 1-215) of excess lung cancer among chromate workersexposed to 0.01 to 0.15 mg/m3 soluble chromate and 0.1 to 0.58 mg/m3 insolublechromate. Animal data cited by the ACGIH indicate that insoluble chromatesalts were likely to have been responsible for the increased incidenceof cancer seen in the Mancuso and Hueper (1951/Ex. 1-215) study. The ACGIH(1986/Ex. 1-3) concluded that the 0.05-mg/m3 TLV-TWA would protect workersfrom chromium-induced nasal irritation and possible liver or kidney damage,and, in the case of the insoluble chromates, would provide an adequatemargin of safety from respiratory cancer.NIOSH (1975a/Ex. 1-185) cited several studies showing inflammation andulceration of the nasal cavity at short-term exposure levels greater than0.1 mg CrO<T2>3</T2>/m3. In its criteria document on chromic acid (NIOSH 1973e/Ex.1-264), NIOSH recommended that the current OSHA ceiling limit (0.1 mg CrO<T2>3</T2>/m3) be supplemented with a 0.05-mg CrO<T2>3</T2>/m3 10-hour TWA limit. In its criteria document on chromium (VI),NIOSH (1975b/Ex. 1-258) reaffirmed these limits but extended their applicationto all forms of noncarcinogenic chromate. Thus, the 0.1-mg CrO<T2>3</T2>/m3 ceiling limit corresponds to a 0.05-mg Cr(VI)/m3 ceilinglimit, and the 0.05-mg CrO<T2>3</T2>/m3 TWA limit corresponds to a 0.025-mg Cr(VI)/m3 TWA. For thecarcinogenic (insoluble) forms of Cr(VI), NIOSH recommends the lowest detectablelevel, which is 0.001 mg Cr(VI)/m3 as a 10-hour TWA.Zinc chromate is an insoluble, carcinogenic form of chromate. Accordingly,the current OSHA limit for chromic acid and chromates applies, as doesthe NIOSH limit of 0.001 mg/m3 for carcinogenic chromates. The ACGIH (1986/Ex.1-3) reviewed several small epidemiologic studies of zinc chromate workers,all of which reported excesses of lung cancer. Because of the consistencyof this evidence, the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) classified zinc chromate asa confirmed human carcinogen (Al) and reduced the TLV to 0.05 mg Cr(VI)m3.xzxEvaluation of the alternate recommendations is complicated by the differentvalence states of chromium compounds, the different methods of measurement(CrO<T2>3</T2> or Cr(VI)), and differences in defining these substances thatpresent a cancer hazard (soluble vs. insoluble or valence state). The 0.05-ppmTWA-TLV is less restrictive than the current 0.05-ppm ceiling limit (asCr(VI)), and would not be considered a revised PEL. In the NPRM, OSHA proposedthat the existing PEL of 0.1 mg/m\3\ (measured as CrO<T2>3</T2>) be maintained. In the NPRM OSHA stated that it would considerwhether to place these substances on its regulatory agenda for future considerationfor section 6(b) rulemaking, rather than making any changes as part ofthis rulemaking. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B) concurred that the chromatesshould be part of a separate 6(b) rulemaking, and both the AFL-CIO (Ex.194) and the UAW (Tr pp. 7-65 to 7-67) agreed that a comprehensive standardwould be appropriate for chromates. No other comments were received onthis issue. Therefore, because of the complexities of the scientific issuesregarding the carcinogenicity of the various forms of chromates, OSHA isnot at this time revising its current PEL for chromic acid or chromates,but will continue to evaluate the need for a separate 6(b) rulemaking forthese substances.<ITAG tagnum="71">CHROMYL CHLORIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 14977-61-8; Chemical Formula: CrO<T2>2</T2>Cl<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S.

The ACGIH recommendedthat a TWA of 0.025 ppm be established, based on this substance's carcinogenicpotential (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 141). The evidence in humans is consideredsufficient for the carcinogenicity of chromium and chromium compounds,and these have been given a Group 1 classification by the InternationalAgency for Research on Cancer (IARC). As discussed above in connectionwith chromic acid, chromates, and zinc chromates, the chromium compoundspresent several important issues that require detailed analysis and canmost appropriately be handled in an individual section 6(b) rulemaking.NIOSH concurred with this approach (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B), and no othercomments on chromyl chloride were received. OSHA intends to commence workon this rulemaking as priorities permit.<ITAG tagnum="71">DIMETHYL SULFATE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 77-78-1; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>2</T2>SO<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1142</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for dimethyl sulfate was 1 ppm TWA, with a skin notation.The ACGIH considers this substance a suspected human carcinogen and hasgiven it a classification of A2 (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 212). The ACGIH'sTLV-TWA for this substance is 0.1 ppm with a skin notation. OSHA proposed,and the final rule establishes, a 0.1-ppm TWA PEL, with a skin notation,for dimethyl sulfate, which is an oily, colorless liquid with a faint,onion-like odor. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A) concurs with the selectionof this limit and considers dimethyl sulfate to be a potential human carcinogen.Dimethyl sulfate is commonly used in the manufacture of many organic chemicals.It has been shown to be carcinogenic in rats by inhalation exposure, subcutaneousinjection, and prenatal exposure. The rat is the only animal species inwhich the carcinogensis of dimethyl sulfate has been tested (IARC 1982c,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, Appendix A).The carcinogenic activity of dimethyl sulfate was investigated in malerats chronically exposed to subcutaneous injections of 8 or 16 mg/kg bodyweight per week (Druckrey, Preussman, Nashed, and Ivanovic 1966/Ex. 1-245).Local sarcomas with metastases to the lung and regional lymph nodes wereobserved at both dose levels. A single subcutaneous injection of dimethylsulfate (50 mg/kg) also produced local sarcomas with metastases to thelung (Druckrey, Kruse, Preussman et al. 1970/Ex. 1-246). However, tumorsdid not develop following chronic weekly intravenous injections of dimethylsulfate (2 or 4 mg/kg) (Druckrey, Kruse, Preussman et al. 1970/Ex. 1-246).Control data were not reported for either of these studies.The carcinogenic potential of dimethyl sulfate exposure by inhalation wasalso evaluated in male rats (Druckrey, Kruse, Preussman et al 1970/Ex.1-246). Animals were exposed to approximately 3 or 10 ppm dimethyl sulfatefor one hour per day, five times weekly, for 130 days. Malignant tumorsdeveloped in 15 percent (3/20) of the rats exposed at 3 ppm and in 18 percent(5/27) of the rats exposed at 10 ppm.Pregnant rats were exposed to a single intravenous injection of dimethylsulfate (20 mg/kg body weight) on day 15 of gestation and the incidenceof malignant tumors in the offspring was investigated for one year. Tumorswere reported in 7/59 of the offspring. However, the incidence of tumorsin the control group was not indicated. The results of this study are complicatedbecause several rats died (number of deaths not specified) from the acutetoxic effects of dimethyl sulfate, and the incidence of tumors in the controlgroup was not reported.There is little information available regarding the carcinogenicity ofdimethyl sulfate in humans. A case study of workers exposed to dimethylsulfate reported that three workers developed bronchial cancer (Druckrey,Preussman, Nashed, and Ivanovic 1966/Ex. 1-245). However, an epidemiologicalstudy by the E.I. du Pont de Nemours Company (1975, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 213) demonstrated no increase in the incidence of respiratory canceramong workers exposed to dimethyl sulfate.OSHA considered the possibility of performing a quantitative risk assessmentfor dimethyl sulfate and concluded that the studies described above didnot have sufficient dose-response data to provide an adequate basis forsuch a risk assessment (see Ex. 85). Dimethyl sulfate induces malignanttumors in animals both by inhalation and ingestion, and there is thus sufficientevidence in animals to predict that workers exposed to dimethyl sulfateare at significant risk of developing cancer, which OSHA considers to bea material impairment of health; exposures at levels only three times theformer PEL (1 ppm) resulted in a significant number of tumors. No comments,other than those from NIOSH were received on dimethyl sulfate. OSHA concludesthat reducing the former limit to 0.1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA with a skinnotation will substantially reduce the significant risk of cancer mortalityassociated with exposure to dimethyl sulfate.<ITAG tagnum="71">2-NITROPROPANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 79-46-9; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>CH(NO<T2>2</T2>)CH<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1291</ITAG>OSHA's former limit for 2-nitropropane (2-NP) was 25 ppm; OSHA proposeda limit of 10 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, and the final rule establishes thislimit. The ACGIH classifies 2-nitropropane as a suspected human carcinogen(A2). NIOSH recommends that 2-nitropropane exposure be reduced to the lowestfeasible limit. 2-Nitropropane is used as a chemical intermediate, a solvent,and a component in paint, ink, and varnishes (Fiala, Czenniak, Castonguayet al. 1987/Ex. 1-248). 2-Nitropropane is a colorless liquid.In rats and chimpanzees, 2-NP is metabolized by microsomal enzymes in theliver to acetone, low levels of isopropanol, and nitrite (Mueller, Coulston,and Korte 1983/Ex. 1-247). Methemoglobin formation is associated with themetabolism of nitropropane and has been reported in cats exposed to 280ppm of 2-NP for seven hours. Sensitivity to the toxic effects of 2-NP inanimals varies by species (Dequidt, Vasseur, and Potencier 1972/Ex. 1-813;ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 441).The mechanisms of carcinogenicity of 2-NP are thought to involve the releaseof nitrite and the formation of a reactive azoxy intermediate that canreact with cellular macromolecules (Williams and Weisburger 1986/Ex. 1-65).In mutagenicity tests, 2-NP increased the frequency of mutations in allstrains of <T3>Salmonella typhimurium </T3>with and without metabolic activation.Positive mutagenicity results were reported in <T3>Salmonella typhimurium </T3>strains TA100, TA1535, and TA98 by Lofroth,Nilsson, and Anderson (1981, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 441) andSpeck, Meyer, Zeiger, and Rosenkranz (1982/Ex. 1-290). 2-NP was not shownto be mutagenic in the mouse micronucleus test (Hite and Skaggs 1979/Ex.1-280).Acute exposures to 2-NP from occupational accidents have been reportedto cause severe liver toxicity and subsequent death in humans (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 441). However, the available epidemiology data on the chronic healtheffects of occupational exposure to 2-NP do not contain sufficient dose-responsedata to use as a basis for quantitative risk estimation. An unpublishedretrospective mortality study of 1,481 potentially exposed workers froma nitropropane production plant found no increase in liver cancer or liverdisease mortality. However, lack of exposure data, the small number ofworkers with long exposures (greater than 15 years), and a short latencyperiod make interpretation of the results of this study difficult (Millerand Temple 1979, and Bolender 1983, both as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 441).There are two studies that report high incidences of liver tumors in malerats exposed to 2-NP by gavage and inhalation. Fiala et al. (1987/Ex. 1-248)administered, by gavage, 1 mmo1/kg body weight (approximately 27 mg pertreatment per 300-gram rat) of 2-NP in a 10-percent aqueous Emulphor EL-620vehicle to male Sprague-Dawley rats three times weekly for 16 weeks. Dosingwas discontinued after 16 weeks because of excessive mortality in the treatedrats. Seventy-seven weeks from the first treatment, the surviving ratswere sacrificed and subjected to necropsy. All (100 percent) of the treatedrats examined had developed hepatocarcinomas (Fiala, Czenniak, Castonguayet al. 1987/Ex. 1-248).The results of the Fiala et al. (1987/Ex. 1-248) study support the earlierpositive results reported by Lewis, Ulrich, and Busey (1979/Ex. 1-826).In the Lewis et al. (1979/Ex. 1-826) study, male Sprague-Dawley rats andmale New Zealand White rabbits were exposed via inhalation to 27 ppm or207 ppm of 2-NP for seven hours/day, five days/week for six months. Atthe end of six months, all 10 rats in the high-dose group exhibited hepatocellularcarcinomas and neoplastic nodules. No exposure-related lesions were seenin the rats exposed to 27 ppm, and no exposure-related lesions were observedin any of the rabbits.One high-dose and two low-dose studies reported negative results for ratsexposed to 2-NP vapors. Griffin, Benitz, Coulston, and Rosenblum (1978/Ex.1-243) reported no hepatic carcinomas in male and female rats exposed to200 ppm of 2-NP by inhalation using a protocol similar to that describedby Lewis et al. (1979/Ex. 1-826). Although no hepatic carcinomas were observed,the following effects (generally occurring more extensively in males) wereseen: Increased liver weights (both sexes); hepatic nodules; hepatocellularnecrosis; and peripheral compression.Two low-dose studies (Griffin, Coulston, and Stein 1980/Ex. 1-268; Griffin,Stein, and Coulston 1981/Ex. 1-279) also produced negative results. Maleand female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed by inhalation to 25 ppm of2-NP for seven hours/day, five days/week for 22 months. No pathologicalchanges associated with exposure to 2-NP were seen. Although the results of both the Lewis et al. (1979/Ex. 1-826) and theFiala et al. (1987/Ex. 1-248) studies show statistically significant increasesin liver carcinomas, neither study provides sufficient dose-response informationto use as a basis to quantify the excess cancer risk to humans exposedto 2-NP. Both studies were terminated before the natural lifetime expectancyof the controls, so it is not possible to determine a background incidenceof cancer risk. No historical information is provided on tumor incidencefor these animals.  2-Nitropropane produced a high incidence of liver tumors in male rats bytwo routes of administration: inhalation and ingestion. Its ability tocause mutations in <T3>Salmonella typhimurium </T3>further supports the premise that 2-NPis a potential human carcinogen. OSHA considered whether to perform a quantitativerisk assessment on 2-NP, and concludes that the studies described abovedo not contain sufficient dose-response data to use as the basis for quantitativerisk estimation using standardized risk assessment models. However, twostudies (Fiala, Czenniak, Castonguay et al. 1987/Ex. 1-248; Lewis, Ulrich,and Busey 1979/Ex. 1-826) demonstrate that exposure to 2-NP, either bygavage or inhalation, produced hepatocarcinomas in rats. In addition, thissubstance produced positive results in two mutagenic assays (Lofroth, Nilsson,and Andersson 1981, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 441; Speck, Meyer,Zeiger, and Rosenkranz 1982/Ex. 1-290). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B) wasof the opinion that this evidence warranted a separate 6(b) rulemaking.OSHA is establishing an 8-hour PEL for 2-NP of 10 ppm. The Agency concludesthat a reduction in the PEL is necessary to protect exposed workers fromthe significant risk of cancer potentially associated with exposure to2-NP at the former PEL. The Agency has also concluded that the effectsassociated with exposure to 2-NP constitute material impairments of health.<ITAG tagnum="71">PERCHLOROETHYLENE (TETRACHLOROETHYLENE) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 127-18-4; Chemical Formula: CCl<T2>2</T2>-CCl<T2>2</T2> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1308</ITAG>OSHA's former permissible exposure limits for perchloroethylene (tetrachloroethylene)were 100 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, 200 ppm as a STEL not to be exceeded formore than five minutes in any three-hour period, and 300 ppm as a ceiling.On the basis of the chemical's narcotic effects in humans, the Agency proposeda revised PEL of 50 ppm TWA and a 15-minute STEL of 200 ppm for perchloroethylene;these are the limits recommended by the ACGIH (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 464).NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B) did not concur with the proposed limits andrecommended that exposures be maintained at the lowest feasible limit andthat this chemical be classified as a potential occupational carcinogen.OSHA has evaluated the health evidence for this substance and has determinedthat a further reduction in the PEL to 25 ppm as a TWA is warranted, andthe Agency is establishing this limit in the final rule. Perchloroethyleneis a clear, colorless, nonflammable liquid with an etheral odor. Perchloroethylene is widely used as a solvent in the dry cleaning industryand in industrial degreasing operations. The narcotic effects associatedwith exposure to high levels of this chemical are well documented. A workerexposed to an estimated concentration of 1470 ppm perchloroethylene andStoddard solvent for 3.5 hours lost consciousness (Stewart, Erley, Schaffer,and Gay 1961/Ex. 1-807). The most comprehensive studies of the effectsof prolonged exposure to perchloroethylene vapors on human volunteers wereconducted by Stewart and colleagues (Stewart, Hake, LeBrun et al. 1974/Ex.1-970; Stewart, Hake, Wu et al. 1977/Ex. 1-971); these investigators concludedthat prolonged exposure to 200 ppm results in early signs of CNS depression,while no response was elicited in men or women exposed repeatedly to 100ppm for seven hours/day, except that performance on the Flanagan coordinationtest was significantly decreased in some exposed subjects (Stewart, Hake,Wu et al. 1977/Ex. 1-971, p. 28). Based on these findings, the Agency concluded that its former PEL permittedworkers to be exposed to a significant risk of CNS effects. In additionto examining the evidence for the chemical's narcotic effects, OSHA hasreviewed a number of studies on the carcinogenicity of perchloroethylene.These investigations are summarized below. In a 1977 gavage bioassay for carcinogenicity, perchloroethylene provedto be a liver carcinogen in mice but not in rats (NCI 1977c, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 464). In 1986, the NTP conducted an inhalation bioassayof perchloroethylene (NTP 1986b/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 4), in which groupsof 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to perchloroethylenefor six hours/day, five days/week, for two years. The exposure concentrationswere 0, 200, or 400 ppm for rats and 0, 100, or 200 ppm for mice. Maleand female rats exposed to either 200 or 400 ppm developed statisticallysignificant increases in mononuclear cell leukemias. According to the NTPreport (NTP 1986b/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 4), the increased incidences of leukemiaswere responsible for the early deaths observed in male and female ratsexposed to perchloroethylene. At autopsy, most of the leukemias were determinedto be in an advanced and probably fatal stage. Because of the effect ofthe leukemias on the early mortality of the exposed rats, a life-tableanalysis was used to test for the statistical significance of the findings;this analysis revealed that the increased incidence of leukemia was statisticallysignificant in both low- and high-dose male rats and in low-dose femalerats, and was marginally significant (p = 0.053) in high-dose female rats.Male rats also developed a significant increase in renal tubular cell adenomasand carcinomas. Perchloroethylene induced a significantly increased incidenceof hepatocellular carcinomas at both dose levels in mice of both sexes.The NTP Peer Review Panel concluded that there was ``clear evidence ofcarcinogenicity of tetrachloroethylene'' (perchloroethylene) in male ratsand in male and female mice, and ``some evidence'' in female rats (Ex.8-31, Appendix 4; Ex. 1-0000, p. 11). In addition, a number of human studies were submitted to the rulemakingrecord that implicate perchloroethylene as a potential carcinogen (Ex.8-31). Among these was a study by Brown and Kaplan (1987/Ex. 8-31, Appendix6), which reported a statistically significant elevation in urinary tractcancer deaths among 1,690 dry cleaning workers exposed to perchloroethyleneand other petroleum solvents. However, a subcohort of workers who usedperchloroethylene as the primary solvent showed no increase in bladdercancer mortality. Brown and Kaplan concluded that ``confounding exposureto petroleum solvents complicates any conclusions regarding the associationbetween * * * [perchloroethylene] and cancer of the urinary tract'' (Brownand Kaplan 1987/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 6, p. 540). Katz and Jowett (1981/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 9) studied the mortality patternof 671 female dry cleaning workers for the period 1963 through 1977. Elevatedincidences of cancers of the kidney and genitals were reported, along witha smaller excess of bladder and skin cancers and lymphosarcomas. The authorsconcluded that, although results obtained with the methodology used (proportionatemortality ratios) require careful interpretation, ``this study raises thepossibility that exposure to dry cleaning fluids may increase the riskof certain cancers'' (Katz and Jowett 1981/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 9, p. 510).The dry cleaning fluids used by members of the cohort included carbon tetrachloride,trichloroethylene, and perchloroethylene. Steinhagen et al. (1983/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 8) reported a significant excessof liver cancer among male workers in the laundry and dry cleaning industryin New Jersey. This study was a retrospective case-control study. The livercancer cases were concentrated among individuals who processed clothesand were exposed to chemicals. The report did not identify the solventsin use (Steinhagen, Slade, Altman, and Bill 1983/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 8).Duh and Asal (1984/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 7) examined the mortality experienceof 440 dry cleaning workers in Oklahoma for the period 1975 through 1981.Elevated standardized mortality odds ratios (SMORs) were found for bothlung cancer (SMOR=1.7) and kidney cancer (SMOR=3.8) (Duh and Asal 1984/Ex.8-31, Appendix 7). Eric Frumin of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU)submitted a quantitative risk assessment conducted by Dr. Dale Hattis ofthe Center for Technology Policy and Industrial Development at the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology (Hattis 1986/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 11-A). This workwas conducted in 1986 for the National Institute for Environmental HealthSciences. Dr. Hattis used a pharmacokinetic model that incorporated species-specificrates of formation for the metabolites of perchlorethylene. Using the ratleukemia and mouse liver tumor data from the NTP (1986b/Ex. 8-31, Appendix4) bioassay, Dr. Hattis obtained a ``best estimate'' of the lifetime cancerrisk (for workers exposed at the former 100-ppm OSHA limit for 45 yearsto perchloroethylene) of 45 deaths per 1,000 workers. The plausible upperlimit at this level of exposure was 650 per 1,000 workers. The best-estimatelifetime risks associated with 45 years of exposure to 50 or 10 ppm ofperchloroethylene were 25 and 6.4 deaths per 1,000 workers, respectively(the upper-confidence limits were 420 and 110 deaths per 1,000 workers,respectively). The ACTWU asserted that the studies reviewed above provide``overwhelming'' evidence that perchloroethylene is a potential human carcinogen,and urged OSHA to establish a PEL lower than the proposed 50-ppm limit.In its posthearing comments, the Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance(HSIA) (Ex. 186) discussed several aspects of the data on perchlorethyleneto support its contention that perchloroethylene should not be considereda probable human carcinogen. Specifically, the HSIA pointed out the following:andbullet; Brown and Kaplan (1987/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 6) found no increasedevidence of cancer among a subcohort of workers exposed only to perchloroethyleneand not to other dry cleaning solvents. andbullet; Both EPA and IARC have determined the human evidence on the carcinogenicityof perchloroethylene to be ``inadequate.''andbullet; The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciencesconcluded that the results of the NCI gavage study (NCI 1977c) should beinterpreted with caution because of the large doses administered, earlymortality of the treated animals, and observed nephrotoxicity. andbullet; Regarding the NTP inhalation bioassay (NTP 1986b), the EPA ScienceAdvisory Board (SAB) determined that the incidence of rat leukemia wasnot related to perchloroethylene exposure, and that the development ofmale rat kidney tumors was brought about by a mechanism unique to malerats. andbullet; The EPA SAB stated that the mouse liver tumors observed in boththe gavage (NCI 1977c) and inhalation (NTP 1986b) bioassays arose as aresult of perchloroethylene-induced peroxisomal proliferation, a mechanismspecific to rodents. OSHA does not agree with the HSIA's interpretation of the meaning of thepoints raised by this group. First, the authors of the Brown and Kaplan(1987/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 6) study themselves pointed to the difficultyof establishing a definitive link between a particular solvent and an increasedincidence of cancer in workers in the dry cleaning industry. For example,in the case of the group exposed to perchloroethylene only, the numberof workers in the cohort was so small that even two or three exposure-relateddeaths in the perchloroethylene-only group would have caused a drasticswing in the SMR for bladder cancer in this subcohort. Thus, OSHA doesnot find that this study demonstrates the noncarcinogenicity of perchloroethylene.As to the HSIA's second point, that neither the EPA nor IARC found theevidence for the carcinogenicity of perchloroethylene in humans adequate,OSHA notes that such evidence exists only for a handful of carcinogens(e.g., asbestos, benzene, vinyl chloride, arsenic), and that the overwhelmingnumber of substances recognized as posing carcinogenic risks to workershave been determined to be carcinogenic on the basis of results in animalsonly. OSHA also believes that the regulation of many substances that havebeen designated as potential human carcinogens on the basis of clear evidenceof their carcinogenicity in animals has undoubtedly contributed to thelack of evidence in humans by preventing overexposures to these substancesin the workplace, and thus preventing cancer among these workers. Therefore,OSHA believes it appropriate and prudent to reduce workplace exposuresto substances that have caused cancer in animals, especially when the animalstudies are well-designed and carefully conducted bioassays. The HSIA's third point, that the NCI gavage bioassay (NCI 1977c) has limitations,is irrelevant in the context of this discussion because OSHA is not relyingon this bioassay to establish an appropriate limit for perchloroethylene.The fourth point raised by the HSIA was that the Science Advisory Boardof the EPA has questioned the relevance for human cancer risk of some ofthe tumors seen in the NTP (1986b/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 4) inhalation bioassay.OSHA believes that an explanation of the nature of the SAB's concern willdemonstrate that an interpretation of the meaning of these data is a matterof professional judgment on which expert scientists themselves can differ.The SAB noted that there is some uncertainty regarding the significanceof the leukemias observed in the perchloroethylene-exposed rats in theNTP (1986b/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 4) inhalation bioassay becasue the controlrats in <T3>another</T3> NTP bioassay (NTP 1986c, the bioassay for methylene chloride)showed the same incidence of leukemias as the perchloroethylene-exposedrats (Ex. 186, pp. 6-7). However, OSHA points out that the independentpeer review panel appointed by the NTP to evaluate the strength of theevidence for the carcinogenicity of perchloroethylene also considered theappropriateness of including the rat leukemia data when weighing the evidencefor the carcinogenicity of perchloroethylene; the NTP panel concluded thatthe NTP (1986b/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 4) bioassay presented ``clear evidence''of perchloro-ethylene's carcinogenicity in male rats (Ex. 8-31, Appendix4, pp. 14-15). Thus, different scientists or groups of experts may interpretthe same data differently; in this case, OSHA is not prepared to dismissout-of-hand the leukemia data, given that leukemia contributed significantlyto excess mortality in the perchloroethylene-exposed groups (NTP 1986b/Ex.8-31, Appendix 4). The HSIA also questioned the relevance of the kidneytumors in male rats found in the NTP (1986b) bioassay. OSHA agrees withthe SAB that these tumors may not be good predictors of human risk; however,the Hattis (1986/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 11-A) risk assessment did not use therat kidney tumor data, and, in addition, OSHA is not relying on these findingsto set the final rule's limit for perchloroethylene. On the HSIA's fifth point, the significance of rat liver tumors as predictorsof human cancer risk, OSHA notes that the SAB did not believe it appropriateto disregard the findings in the recent NTP (1986b/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 4)bioassay of perchloroethylene-dose-related increases in the incidence ofliver tumors in mice. In a letter dated to EPA Administrator Lee Thomasin March 1988 (Ex. 186D), the SAB concluded:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Board's consensus on the significance of mouse liver tumors isthat mechanistic explanations are not sufficiently well developed and validatedat this time to change EPA's present approach expressed in its risk assessmentguidelines for carcino-genicity. It concludes that the generation of mouseliver tumors by chemicals is an important predictor of potential risksto humans (Ex. 186D, p. 2).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Based on the expert opinion of the NTP Peer Review panel and the EPASAB, OSHA finds that the NCI (1986b/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 4) inhalation bioassayrat leukemia and mouse liver tumor data, which form the basis for the perchloroethylenequantitative risk assessment performed by Dr. Hattis (1986/Ex. 8-31, Appendix11-A), should be regarded at this time as being relevant to the determinationof potential human cancer risk from exposure to perchloroethylene in theworkplace. The use of the rat leukemia data for the risk assessment may,however, add additional uncertainty to the risk estimates.When EPA's Science Advisory Board considered perchloroethylene in Januaryof 1987 (Ex./186C), it designated this substance as a Category C substance(i.e., a possible human carcinogen). However, in a letter to EPA AdministratorLee Thomas in March of 1988 (Ex. 186D), the SAB concluded that the overallweight of evidence for perchloroethylene ``lies on the continuum betweencategories B2 [probable human carcinogen] and C.'' The SAB also statedthat<ITAG tagnum="20">the distinction between the B2 and C categories can be an arbitrarydistinction on a continuum of weight of evidence. The ``black-white interpretation''* * * is indeed troubling * * *.

In many instances,this appearance of safety results from not yet having the results fromwell-designed bioassays such as those conducted by the National ToxicologyProgram.</ITAG>OSHA agrees with the SAB that perchloroethylene is a substance that meetsseveral of the criteria regarded by the SAB as meriting regulatory action.First, current exposures to perchloroethylene are high, often reachingthe levels permitted by OSHA's existing PEL of 100 ppm. Second, severalhundred thousand employees are regularly exposed to this widely used solvent.Third, the Hattis (1986/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 11-A) quantitative risk assessmentsuggests that a high cancer risk may be associated with exposure to perchloroethyleneat OSHA's former or proposed PELs, indicating that exposures should bereduced to levels below the proposed 50-ppm level. Finally, the evidencefor the carcinogenicity of perchloroethylene, which is briefly summarizedbelow, is convincing.The NTP (1986b/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 4) has concluded that perchloroethyleneis carcinogenic by inhalation in both rats and mice. Based predominantlyon the animal data, NIOSH has also concluded that perchoroethylene is apotential human carcinogen; NIOSH judged the evidence for perchloroethylene'scarcinogenicity sufficient to warrant a separate 6(b) rulemaking (Ex. 8-47,Table N6B). In 1987, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)also classified perchloroethylene as a Category 2B carcinogen (i.e., asubstance for which the evidence in animals is sufficient). The EPA's SABhas determined that perchloroethylene is a Category C carcinogen (i.e.,a possible human carcinogen, and a carcinogen in animals). In addition,a number of human studies suggest elevated cancer risks, particularly ofthe kidney and bladder, among workers exposed to perchloroethylene andother solvents in dry cleaning facilities. Based on a review of all ofthe available evidence on perchloroethylene, including the testimony andbriefs submitted by the parties, OSHA has determined that perchloroethyleneis a potential human carcinogen that presents a significant risk of materialhealth impairment to workers exposed to it in their places of work. Thisview was shared by several parties commenting in the record, includingthe Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (Ex. 192), the AFL-CIO(Ex. 194), the American Public Health Association (Ex. 151), and NIOSH(Ex. 8-47).The risk assessment conducted by Hattis (1986/Ex. 8-31, Appendix 11-A)estimates that there is an excess lifetime cancer mortality risk of 45deaths per 1,000 workers exposed for 45 years to the current 100-ppm TWAPEL. Clearly, this high risk of mortality represents a significant risk.At the proposed level of 50 ppm, Dr. Hattis estimated the excess lifetimerisk to be 27 deaths per 1,000 workers. OSHA concludes that this assessmentand the underlying evidence clearly indicate that a further reduction inthe PEL is necessary.OSHA's analysis of the technological feasibility of reducing perchloroethyleneexposures in affected industries, particularly in the dry cleaning industry,demonstrates that a PEL of 25 ppm is achievable using engineering and workpractice controls; however, OSHA does not believe that information in therecord at the present time demonstrates that it is feasible to reduce exposuresto lower levels (see Section VII). In the dry cleaning industry, newerequipment, such as dry-to-dry dry cleaning machines, can achieve 25 ppmwith engineering and work practice controls. This is true of smaller aswell as larger operations.The industry is gradually replacing older equipment with newer equipment,and a significant percentage of operations, including smaller operations,have installed such equipment. According to the industry, dry cleaningequipment is replaced at approximately 10-year intervals.OSHA is providing a four-year phase-in period for the industry to comeinto compliance with the new levels through the use of engineering controls.Accordingly, OSHA believes that both smaller and larger dry cleaning operationscan achieve the new 25-ppm TWA level in the ordinary course of the equipmentreplacement schedule. Consequently, the economic impact of the change tonew equipment would not be great even for smaller operations.In addition, use of older equipment in good condition results in employeeexposure levels not much above the new 25-ppm PEL. Industry estimates indicatethat levels of approximately 40 ppm can be attained. During the four-yearinterval noted in this regulation, reasonably priced retrofits for olderequipment may be developed that can be used to achieve the 25-ppm PEL.OSHA is, of course, sympathetic to the circumstances of small businesses.If, after three years following publication of this regulation, it appearsthat there will be significant economic impacts for small dry cleaningoperations attempting to convert to new equipment or retrofit within thefour years permitted by the standard, OSHA will consider extending theperiod for smaller dry cleaning operations to achieve compliance usingengineering and work practice controls. If that situation develops, OSHAbelieves that a trade association petition bringing the facts to OSHA'sattention would be appropriate. OSHA would, at that time, evaluate theavailable information and make a decision based on all the informationobtainable.OSHA is establishing in the final rule a revised 8-hour TWA PEL of 25 ppmfor perchloroethylene. OSHA concludes that the revised limit will substantiallyreduce the significant risk of material impairment of health presentedby exposure to this substance at the Agency's former PEL of 100 ppm.<ITAG tagnum="71">o-TOLUIDINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 95-53-4; Chemical Formula CH<T2>3</T2>C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>NH<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1399</ITAG>OSHA's former 8-hour TWA for o-toluidine was 5 ppm, with a skin notation.OSHA proposed to revise this limit to 2 ppm as an 8-hour TWA, with a skinnotation. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A) concurs with the selection of thislimit and notes that o-toluidine meets the OSHA definition of a potentialhuman carcinogen. The ACGIH identifies o-toluidine as a suspected humancarcinogen and has accordingly placed it in the A2 category (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 586). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC 1982b,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 586) classifies o-toluidine as a probablecarcinogen (category 2A) based on sufficient evidence of its carcinogenicityin rats and mice following oral administration (IARC 1982b, as cited inACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 586). IARC judged the evidence inadequate to establisho-toluidine's carcinogenicity in humans. In the final rule, OSHA has determinedthat it is appropriate to retain both the existing 5-ppm exposure limitand the skin notation for this substance. o-Toluidine is a light yellowliquid that rapidly darkens on exposure to air and light.o-Toluidine is mutagenic in short-term tests, inducing sister chromatidexchanges and unscheduled DNA synthesis in mammalian cells in <T3>in vitro </T3>and chromosomal anomalies in yeast. o-Toluidine was negativein the micronucleus test in mice <T3>in vivo, </T3>but induced cell transformations in the BHK (baby hamsterkidney) assay. IARC considers these data to be sufficient evidence of o-toluidine'sactivity in short-term tests (IARC 1982b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 586).There are a number of studies that report an excess of bladder tumors indyestuff workers exposed to o-toluidine and other chemicals; however, thereare no studies that examine a population of workers exposed to o-toluidinealone. Workers exposed to toluene, o-nitrotoluene, o-toluidine, and 4,4-methylenebis (2-methylaniline) in manufacturing were observed to have an excessof bladder tumors. However, the concurrent exposures of these workers tothese other potential carcinogens make these data inappropriate for usein the quantitative assessment of o-toluidine's carcinogenic risk in humanpopulations. A few reports of bladder tumors in persons exposed primarilyto o-toluidine have been reported, but insufficient follow-up time andincomplete data have prevented the establishment of a clear quantitativeassociation between o-toluidine exposure and cancer in humans. For thisreason, IARC considers the data from human studies inadequate to establishan association between exposure to o-toluidine and cancer (IARC 1982b,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 586).o-Toluidine has been determined to be carcinogenic in rats and mice followingoral administration. In rats, statistically significant increases in subcutaneousfibromas, fibrosarcomas, and cancers of the urinary bladder have been reported.Studies in mice have resulted in statistically significant increases inhemangiosarcomas and hepatocellular carcinomas.The National Cancer Institute (NCI 1979c, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 586) conducted long-term carcinogenicity studies with o-toluidine inrats and mice. Both of these studies were positive for carcinogenicity.The mouse study used groups of 50 female and 50 male B6C3F1 mice fed o-toluidinehydrochloride in the diet at levels of 1000 ppm or 3000 ppm for 102 to103 weeks. There was no excess mortality in the tested animals. At the3000-ppm dose level, there was a statistically significant increase inhemangiosarcomas at all sites in males and a statistically significantincrease in hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas in females.The National Cancer Institute also conducted a two-year feeding study with50 male and 50 female Fischer 344 rats. There was a dose-related trendin mortality (which was not caused by cancer); all the males in the high-dosegroup died by 100 weeks. However, the females at both dose levels wereobserved to have significant increases in transitional-cell carcinomasor papillomas of the urinary bladder, and the high-dose females developedfibroadenomas of the mammary gland. The males at both dose levels showedsignificant increases in fibromas of the subcutaneous tissue and mesotheliomasin multiple organs (NCI 1979c, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 586).The high mortality in the males complicates the interpretation of theselatter findings.Weisburger, Russfield, Homburger et al. (1978/Ex. 1-535) reported positivefindings for o-toluidine in long-term feeding studies in rats and mice.The study in rats was conducted with two groups of 25 male CD rats fedo-toluidine in the diet via one of two regimens: 8000 ppm for three monthsand then 4000 ppm for an additional 15 months; or 16,000 ppm for threemonths and then 8000 ppm for an additional 15 months. Statistically significantincreases in the incidence of subcutaneous fibromas and fibrosarcomas wereobserved in both dose groups. In addition, there was a nonstatisticallysignificant increase in the incidence of transitional-cell carcinomas ofthe urinary bladder in these animals.Weisburger, Russfield, Homburger et al. (1978/Ex. 1-535) also reportedthe results of a long-term study in mice. Groups of 25 males and 25 femaleCD-1 mice were fed diets containing o-toluidine at two dose levels: 16,000ppm for three months and then 8000 ppm for an additional 15 months; or32,000 ppm for three months and then 8000 ppm for an additional 15 months.There was a statistically significant, dose-related increase in the incidencesof vascular tumors (hemangiosarcomas and hemangiomas of the abdominal viscera)in both sexes of treated mice, compared with results in control mice.<T3>Risk estimate for o-toluidine.</T3> Four of these carcinogenicity studiesof o-toluidine have yielded sufficient and adequate data for quantitativerisk estimation: the two NCI studies (NCI 1979c, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 586) and the two Weisburger et al. (1978/Ex. 1-535) studies. OSHAhas used the NCI (1979c) study in rats as the basis for its quantitativerisk assessment because it provides the most appropriate data. Table C15-7presents the Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLEs) of excess deaths per 1,000employees predicted to result from exposure to o-toluidine at the currentOSHA PEL of 5 ppm and at the proposed PEL of 2 ppm. These data were calculatedusing a multistage model, GLOBAL83.<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert illus 0 1408B</ITAG>Table C15-7 shows an excess MLE estimate of risk of 1.4 per 10,000 workersexposed over their working lifetimes at the current PEL. This risk wouldbe reduced to 0.5 per 10,000 exposed workers after promulgation of thefinal rule's limit of 2 ppm. This level of risk is lower than the levelsOSHA has regulated for some carcinogens, such as ethylene oxide, arsenic,and benzene. George M. Talley and Michael C. Garcia, Industrial Hygienistsfor the Los Alamos National Laboratory, commented that OSHA's risk assessmentdoes not support a reduction in the PEL for o-toluidine (Ex. 3-1095).Lawrence Hecker of Abbott Laboratories (Tr. pp. 9-149) commented that OSHA'sskin notation for o-toluidine is not supported by the available evidence.As described in Section VI.C.18 of the preamble regarding OSHA's generalpolicy for establishing skin notations in this rulemaking, OSHA has determinedthat removal of an existing skin notation is not warranted unless humandata are available that demonstrate the absence of a significant healthrisk from dermal contact with the hazardous substance in question. No suchdata exist for o-toluidine; therefore, OSHA is retaining the skin notationfor o-toluidine in the final rule.OSHA has concluded that further reduction in the exposure limit for o-toluidinewould require a detailed analysis of the levels at which significant riskis eliminated. Both because of the scope of this rulemaking and becausethere were few comments on this issue, OSHA has not directed its limitedresources to conduct a detailed analysis of this issue at this time. Accordingly,OSHA has concluded that it is appropriate to retain both the existing 5-ppmPEL and the skin notation for o-toluidine in this proceeding. OSHA is notmaking any final determination on either the general policy issue or whatits conclusion might be in a single-substance rulemaking involving extensivepublic comment and detailed analysis.<ITAG tagnum="71">p-TOLUIDINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 106-49-0; Chemical Formula: CH<T2>3</T2>C<T2>6</T2>H<T2>4</T2>NH<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1400</ITAG>OSHA had no former PEL for p-toluidine. OSHA proposed establishing a 2-ppmPEL, with a skin notation, and these limits are established in the finalrule. The ACGIH considers this substance a suspected human carcinogen andhas given it a classification of A2 (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3). p-Toluidine isa white solid.One study investigates the carcinogenic potential of lifetime exposureto p-toluidine in experimental animals (Weisburger, Russfield, Homburgeret al. 1978/Ex. 1-535). Male and female mice were exposed to p-toluidinein the diet for a total of 18 months. During the first six months of theexperiment, mice were exposed to 1000 or 2000 mg p-toluidine/kg diet. Asa result of the weight loss that occurred in mice exposed to the 2000 mg/kgdiet dose, the concentrations of p-toluidine were reduced to 500 and 1000mg/kg diet during the last 12 months of exposure. The rate of food consumptionby the animals was not reported and was assumed to be 3 g/day. Thus, theaverage doses of p-toluidine received during the 18-month exposure werecalculated to be 80 and 160 mg/kg body weight per day (Weisburger, Russfield,Homburger et al. 1978/Ex. 1-535).For both the low and high dietary doses of p-toluidine, a significant increasein the incidence of hepatomas was observed. The incidence of tumors inthe control, 80, and 160 mg/kg/day groups were 3/38, 10/38, and 12/35,respectively. The same study (Weisburger, Russfield, Homburger et al. 1978/Ex.1-535) showed negative results in male rats exposed to two doses of p-toluidinein the diet for 18 months (1000- and 2000-mg/kg diet).<T3>Risk estimate for p-toluidine. </T3>To assess the quantitative riskof p-toluidine's carcinogenicity. OSHA used the Weisburger et al. (1978/Ex.1-535) data which, despite some limitations (e.g., changes in dose levelsduring the experiment and the absence of data concerning the amount offood animals consumed during the exposure period), were considered adequatefor risk assessment purposes.The maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of excess cancers per 1,000 workersover an occupational lifetime and the 95-percent upper-bound estimateswere obtained by using a linearized multistage model (GLOBAL83). Thesevalues are summarized in Table C15-8. This table shows the number of cancerdeaths potentially associated with working lifetime exposure to 20, 5,or 2 ppm p-toluidine.<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">insert illus. 0 1412A</ITAG>OSHA concludes, as Table C15-8 shows, that workers exposed to p-toluidine,which was formerly not regulated by OSHA, are at significant risk of developmenthepatomas; an effect that the Agency considers a material impairment ofhealth. For example, the MLE at 20 ppm is 112 excess cancer deaths per1,000 workers exposed over a working lifetime. Promulgating a PEL of 2ppm will substantially reduce this significant risk. According to thisscenario, a 90-percent reduction in excess cancer deaths will be achievedby establishing the 2-ppm limit. The risks existing at the former uncontrolledlevel are clearly significant. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B) judged the evidenceon p-toluidine sufficient to warrant a separate 6(b) rulemaking. OSHA isestablishing an 8-hour TWA limit of 2 ppm for p-toluidine in the finalrule; a skin notation is included to protect against percutaneous absorptionof this substance.<ITAG tagnum="71">VINYL BROMIDE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 593-60-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>3</T2>Br</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1025</ITAG>OSHA had no former PEL for vinyl bromide. Based on the ACGIH recommendation,OSHA proposed a 5-ppm TWA PEL; this limit is established in the final rule.NIOSH has no REL for vinyl bromide. The ACGIH places vinyl bromide on itsA2 list of industrial substances suspected of having carcinogenic potentialin humans. Vinyl bromide is a colorless gas with a characteristic odorand is used as an intermediate in organic synthesis and in the manufactureof polymers, copolymers, and flame retardants. Its principal use is asa flame retardant.Henschler and Hoos (1982/Ex. 1-818) believe that vinyl bromide undergoesthe same mechanism of biotransformation as its structural analog, vinylchloride, a recognized human carcinogen that has been regulated by OSHAin a section 6(b) rulemaking. The microsomal oxidation of vinyl bromideleads to epoxide formation, which results, in turn, in the formation ofa reactive intermediate. This intermediate has that potential to form covalentbonds with DNA to produce a mutagenic response. Vinyl bromide has beenreported to be mutagenic in <T3>Salmonella typhimurium </T3>and <T3>tradescantia </T3>(IARC 1979a/Ex. 1-1125; NIOSH/OSHA 1978/Ex. 1-1119).No epidemiological studies have been conducted on populations exposed tovinyl bromide. Benya, Busey, Dorato, and Berteau (1982/Ex. 1-244) reporteda positive carcinogenic response in an inhalation study of rats exposedto vinyl bromide vapor; this study is important because inhalation is amajor mode of occupational exposure. The results of the Van Duuren (1977/Ex.1-284) study were equivocal (described below), in that female Swiss albinomice were exposed dermally or by subcutaneous injection either to vinylbromide in acetone or to polymerized vinyl bromide in an aqueous latexsolution.Benya et al. (1982/Ex. 1-244) exposed male and female Sprague-Dawley ratsto 0, 9.7, 52, 247, or 1235 ppm vinyl bromide by inhalation for six hoursdaily, five days per week, for two years. The incidence of angiosarcomas,primarily of the liver, was found to be statistically significant in alldose groups tested except controls. It should be noted that a closely relatedchemical analog, vinyl chloride, also causes liver angiosarcoma in humansand animals. The combined incidences of hepatic angiosarcomas in the treatedmale and female rats were 1/288, 17/240, 86/240, 122/240, and 84/240 fortheir respective dose levels. One female rat in the control group developedan hepatic angiosarcoma. Table C15-9 summarizes the incidence of angiosarcomain control and treated rats.<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">insert illus 0 1415A</ITAG>Van Duuren (1977/Ex. 1-284) injected a group of female ICR/Ha Swiss miceonce weekly for 48 weeks with 0.05 ml of commerical polymerized vinyl bromideaqueous latex suspension; the animals were observed for 420 days. Nineteenof the 30 mice developed sarcomas at the site of injection. Animals ina positive control group that had been injected with b-propriolactone (0.3mg/.05 ml trioctanoin) developed 18 sarcomas and three squamous cell carcinomas(in 30 mice). No tumors developed in untreated controls or in controlsinjected with trioctanoin, an organic solvent, alone (Van Duuren 1977/Ex.1-284).In another injection study by the same author, a group of female IRC/HaSwiss mice were treated with 25 mg vinyl bromide per animal in 0.05 mltrioctanoin once weekly for 48 weeks. The mice were observed for 420 days.One control group was given a weekly injection of trioctanoin alone andthe other control group was untreated. No local tumors were seen in anyof the test groups, although pathological examination of the animals appearsto have been incomplete (Van Duuren 1977/Ex. 1-284).Application of vinyl bromide to the skin of female ICR/Ha Swiss mice ata dose of 15 mg per animal administered in 0.1 m1 of acetone three timesweekly for 420 days resulted in no tumors. When this solution was appliedonce and was followed by an application of phorbol myristyl acetate (PMA)three times weekly, one of 30 mice developed a skin papilloma at 412 days,one control treated with PMA developed a tumor after 44 days, and no untreatedcontrols developed tumors (Van Duuren 1977/Ex. 1-284).In another dermal study, a dose of 0.1 m1 of polymerized vinyl bromidein an aqueous latex suspension was applied three times weekly to the skinof female ICR/Ha Swiss mice for 420 days. No skin tumors developed. Whenthis solution was applied once, followed by an application of PMA threetimes weekly, one of 30 mice developed a skin tumor at 175 days. No untreatedcontrols developed skin tumors (Van Duuren 1977/Ex. 1-284).<T3>Risk estimate for vinyl bromide. </T3> The Benya et al. (1982/Ex. 1-244)study was a well-designed and -conducted study that yielded sufficientinformation for quantitative risk estimation. The route of administrationused in the study, inhalation, is directly applicable to occupational exposure,and the incidence of hepatic angiosarcoma was significant. Angiosarcomais a rare and malignant neoplasm that has a very low background incidencein animals and humans. Therefore, its appearance in the exposed rats supportsthe premise that vinyl bromide is potentially carcinogenic in humans. Also,it is the same tumor that is associated with the exposure of workers andanimals to vinyl chloride, a recognized human carcinogen and a compoundwhose structure is similar to that of vinyl bromide. To estimate excess cancer risk over background incidence for a chemical,experimental data (experimental doses and corresponding responses) areused to define various parameters of an assumed response model. At lowdoses, the slope of this dose-response curve is referred to as q<T2>1</T2>. The 95-percent upper-bound confidence limit for this slopeis referred to as q<T2>1</T2>* or the chemical's potency. q<T2>1</T2> and q<T2>1</T2>* are then used to determine the respective maximum likelihoodestimate (MLE) of risk and the 95-percent upper-bound confidence limit(UCL) on risk associated with a given lifetime occupational exposure. Anonthreshold, linearized multistage model (GLOBAL83) was chosen to estimatethe risk potentially associated with exposure to vinyl bromide becausethe scientific rationale for this model is biologically the most plausible.Additionally, the choice of a nonthreshold model is consistent with currentmethodologies when positive mutagenicity data are available (<T3>Guidelines for Carcinogenic Risk Assessment, </T3>EPA 1984d). Since both male and female rats responded equally to vinyl bromide treatment,data from the two groups were combined by calculating the geometric meansof the risk estimates derived from the male and female response data (Anderson1983/Ex. 1-1009). The high-dose data for each test group were dropped,since their inclusion makes the dose-response curve nonmonotonic and precludesproper fitting of the linearized multistage risk model (EPA 1984d). Since cancer risk modeling assumes lifetime exposure, adjustments weremade to fit the animal data to this criterion. The adjustments made forthe data in the Benya et al. (1982/Ex. 1-244) study were: multiplying doseby \5/7\ to adjust for days of exposure per week and by \6/24\ to adjustfor hours of exposure per day. These adjusted doses were then changed tohuman equivalent doses. Three hypothetical occupational exposure limits, 5 ppm, 20 ppm, and 250ppm, were used to calculate the maximum likelihood estimates of risk ofdeveloping angiosarcoma of the liver. Five ppm has been the ACGIH limitsince 1978. Twenty ppm was chosen as an intermediate exposure level, and250 ppm was the ACGIH TLV before the ACGIH reduced it in 1978. These occupationaldose levels were also adjusted for lifetime exposure. The adjustments madewere: multiplying dose by \5/7\ to adjust for days worked per week, by\50/52\ to adjust for vacation time, by \8/24\ to adjust for hours of exposureper day, and by \45/70\ to adjust for work years per lifetime. Because inhalation is the primary route of exposure to vinyl bromide inoccupational settings, the occupational dose was calculated assuming thatair intake in humans is 20 m\3\ per 24-hour day (Anderson 1983/Ex. 1-1009).The fraction of vinyl bromide absorbed was assumed to be 100 percent, becauseno absorption rate data were available for vinyl bromide. Because the logp (lipid solubility) value for vinyl bromide (1.52) is similar to thatfor vinyl chloride (1.38), OSHA assumed that the absorption rates of thesetwo compounds would also be similar. The absorption rate for vinyl chlorideused in risk estimations is assumed to be 100 percent (IRIS 1988). The MLE shown in Table C15-10 for an occupational exposure to 250 ppm ofvinyl bromide is 870 excess deaths per 1,000 workers. According to thelinearized multistage risk model, 870 of 1,000 workers exposed over theirworking lifetimes to vinyl bromide at 250 ppm are at risk of developingangiosarcoma. The MLE for an occupational exposure to 5 ppm of vinyl bromideis 0.04; this indicates that, at the proposed PEL, 40 workers per 1,000exposed to this substance over their occupational lifetimes are at riskof developing angiosarcoma. <G/><ITAG tagnum="7">insert illus 0 1421A</ITAG>NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6B) believes that the limit for vinyl bromide shouldbe determined in a full section 6(b) rulemaking. The International ChemicalWorkers Union (Tr. p. 216) and the Workers Institute for Safety and Health(Ex. 116) were both of the opinion that the residual cancer risk remainingat the proposed 5-ppm PEL is excessive, and that a further reduction inthe PEL is warranted. OSHA agrees with these commenters that significantrisk has not been eliminated at the 5-ppm level. However, as explainedin Section III of this preamble, the broad scope of this rulemaking preventedthe Agency from making detailed analyses of risk and feasibility for alternativePELs. As priorities indicate and resources permit in the future, OSHA mayconsider the need for a further reduction in the PEL for vinyl bromide.Table C15-10 shows that workers exposed to this substance, which was formerlynot regulated by OSHA, are clearly at significant risk of developing hepaticangiosarcomas, the same rare type of tumor associated with exposure tovinyl chloride, a structurally similar substance. OSHA determined in itsprior rulemaking on vinyl chloride that this disease constitutes a materialimpairment of health and functional capacity. Promulgating a PEL of 5 ppmwill not eliminate this significant risk, because, as Table C15-10 shows,the MLE estimate of residual risk at 5 ppm is 40 excess deaths per 1,000exposed workers. Thus, residual risk at 5 ppm is clearly significant. Atthe present time, OSHA concludes that establishing a PEL of 5 ppm TWA willsubstantially reduce the significant risk of cancer potentially associatedwith exposure at the uncontrolled levels formerly permitted in the absenceof an OSHA limit for this substance. <ITAG tagnum="71">VINYL CYCLOHEXENE DIOXIDE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 106-87-6; Chemical Formula: C<T2>8</T2>H<T2>12</T2>O<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1426</ITAG>OSHA had no former PEL for vinyl cyclohexene dioxide (VCD). OSHA proposedestablishing a 10-ppm TWA PEL, with a skin notation, for VCD, and thislimit is established in the final rule. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A) agreesthat this limit is appropriate and notes its determination that VCD isa potential human carcinogen. The ACGIH classifies VCD as a suspected humancarcinogen (A2). Vinyl cyclohexene dioxide is a colorless liquid used asa chemical intermediate and as a monomer in the manufacture of polyglycolscontaining unreacted epoxy groups (Hine, Rowe, White, Darmer, and Youngblood1981/Ex. 1-976). It is also used as a reactive diluent for other diepoxidesand certain epoxy resins (IARC 1976). Turchi, Bonatti, Citti et al. (1981/Ex. 1-282) assayed the mutagenicityof VCD and several other epoxides using the TA100 strain of <T3>S. typhimurium</T3> and V79 Chinese hamster cells; these authors alsoinvestigated the alkylating properties of these chemicals. VCD tested positivein both the <T3>S. typhimurium </T3>test (point mutation) and the V79 Chinese hamstercell test (both point mutation and chromosome aberration), and had an intermediatealkylating capacity relative to other epoxide compounds tested. There are no data concerning the adverse health effects of VCD in humans.There are no reports as a result of industrial experience that reveal carcinogeniceffects in workers caused by VCD exposure (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3). Four studies have reported the development of skin tumors in mice exposeddermally to VCD (Hendry, Homer, and Rose 1951/Ex. 1-250; Kotin and Falk1963/Ex. 1-287; Weil, Condra, Haun, and Streigel 1963/Ex. 1-257; and VanDuuren, Nelson, Orris, Palmes, and Schmitt 1963/Ex. 1-288). The study ofVan Duuren et al. (1963/Ex. 1-288) included controls and is thus particularlywell suited for an evaluation of VCD's carcinogenic potential.These authors painted 30 male Swiss ICR/Ha mice with 0.1 ml of a 10-percentsolution of VCD in benzene three times per week (approximately 100 mg ofsolution per application). Two negative controls were used; one set of150 mice was treated with benzene alone and another set of 207 mice wasnot treated with anything. Fourteen of the 30 VCD-treated mice developedskin tumors after an undefined length of time (mean survival time was 326days). The incidences of skin tumors in the controls were 11/150 and 13/207for the benzene-treated and untreated mice, respectively. The incidenceof skin tumors in the VCD-treated mice was significantly greater than theincidence observed in either of the controls (Van Duuren, Nelson, Orris,Palmes, and Schmitt 1963/Ex. 1-288). The study of Van Duuren et al. (1963/Ex. 1-288) demonstrates the carcinogenicityof VCD in experimental animals. OSHA considered the possibility of conductinga quantitative risk assessment for VCD, and the Agency concluded that thedose-response data in this study are unsuitable for quantitative risk assessmentpurposes because the VCD was administered in a solution of benzene, whichis itself regulated as a carcinogen and classified as such by several authorities(IARC, NTP, NIOSH, and ACGIH). Even though the Van Duuren et al. (1963/Ex.1-288) study included a control for the independent carcinogenic effectsof benzene, the possibility of a synergistic or additive effect of benzeneon VCD cannot be completely ruled out. Vinyl cyclohexene dioxide has been shown to be carcinogenic by dermal applicationin mice, and four studies have confirmed these effects. Based on theseanimal studies showing VCD's carcinogenicity, OSHA concludes that exposedemployees are at significant risk of cancer potentially associated withexposure to VCD at the uncontrolled levels formerly permitted by the absenceof an OSHA limit. The Agency considers this effect a material impairmentof health. No comments, other than NIOSH's, were received pertaining toVCD. The Agency concludes that promulgation of a 10-ppm 8-hour-TWA PEL,with a skin notation, will substantially reduce the significant occupationalrisk confronting VCD-exposed employees. Conclusions for This Group of SubstancesThe Supreme Court in <T3>I.U.D. </T3>v. <T3>A.P.I. </T3>(<T3>supra,</T3> the <T3>Benzene </T3>decision) gave OSHA directions as to its decisional process;that case involved a carcinogen. OSHA is using the Supreme Court's guidancewithin the context of this present broader rulemaking. OSHA is also usingthe approach it has taken in the regulation of arsenic, benzene, EtO, asbestos,and formaldehyde; this approach has been upheld in the Courts of Appeals(see the introduction to this section). In the current rulemaking, OSHAhas considered or performed quantitative risk assessments for each of the17 chemicals discussed in this section; when less detailed dose-responsedata were available, OSHA performed qualitative appraisals of the significanceof the risk. The risk assessments follow the approach OSHA has used inprior rulemakings for carcinogens, a process that has repeatedly been upheldby the courts. The risk assessment review process in this broader rulemakinghas necessarily been more limited than is the case for single-substancerulemakings. OSHA conducted its significant risk analyses using the principles suggestedby the Supreme Court and adopted in its carcinogen rulemakings subsequentto <T3>I.U.D. </T3>v. <T3>A.P.I. </T3>OSHA has established new or revised exposure limits basedon these analyses when they demonstrated that significant risk existedat the former PEL. In some cases, it was not possible for OSHA to conduct quantitative estimatesof cancer risk at the level of detail the Agency has formerly used. Inthese cases, OSHA believes that it has adequately justified the limitsestablished in the final rule; without this latitude, the Agency wouldindeed be in the ``mathematical straitjacket'' alluded to by the Courtin the <T3>Benzene </T3>decision.In sum, where OSHA has concluded that there was sufficient evidence ofpotential carcinogenicity to meet the Agency's legal requirements, theAgency has established an exposure level based on the potential risk ofoccupational cancer. OSHA detemined in several prior rulemakings that thisdisease constitutes a material impairment of health and functional capacity.In the future, depending on priorities and resources, OSHA will furtherreview the data to determine whether a second-stage rulemaking based oncarcinogenicity is appropriate for some of the chemicals where a significantcancer risk appears to remain at the limits promulgated today. Overall, OSHA believes its analyses of the new or revised limits for carcinogenicchemicals meet the Agency's legal requirements. Accordingly, OSHA concludesthat these limits will lead to substantial reductions in the significantrisk currently confronting workers exposed to these substances. <ITAG tagnum="81">16. Substances for Which Current ACGIH TLVs Are Less Stringent ThanExisting OSHA PELs</ITAG>IntroductionAs discussed in Section IV.D of this preamble, OSHA used either the ACGIHor NIOSH limits as a starting point in this rulemaking. There are 14 substancesfor which the ACGIH has increased its recommended TLVs since the time thatOSHA adopted the 1968 TLVs under the authority of section 6(a) of the Act.These substances are listed in Table C16-1, along with their former, proposed,and final rule PELs, CAS numbers, and HS numbers. Evaluating the protectivenessand appropriateness of exposure limits that are less stringent than theirformer Z-table limits represents a special case in this rulemaking. OSHAhas previously stated (see 50 FR 51120, December 13, 1985) the principlesto be followed before the Agency raises an exposure limit. This issue isdiscussed below.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s)0 1429-1430</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>In 1978, OSHA issued a cotton dust standard; this standard did not go intoeffect in any of the nontextile industries. However, although the new standard'sPEL for cotton dust did not apply in these segments, the cotton dust limiton Table Z-1 continued to apply to them. In 1983, OSHA determined thatit would better effectuate the purposes of the Act to exclude the knittingand other nontextile industries from coverage by the Z-table limit forcotton dust. In revoking the Z-table limit, OSHA stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">When it [the Agency] proposes to eliminate a class [of operationsor industry sectors] from either a 6(a) or 6(b) standard on health grounds,the evidence must affirmatively indicate that significant risk is unlikelyto exist for that class at exposures likely to exist after the standardhas been eliminated * * *. OSHA must be able to support with substantialevidence any change it is propounding (50 FR 51120 <T3>et seq.</T3>, December 13, 1985).</ITAG>Accordingly, the Agency must be able to show that exposed workers willnot be placed at increased risk of the health effects at issue even <T3>after</T3> the limit in question has been raised or revoked. In conformancewith this interpretation, OSHA has carefully examined the bases underlyingthe adoption of increased exposure limits by the ACGIH. After reviewingthe available data for these substances, OSHA has made a determinationthat adequate evidence does not exist to increase the permissible exposurelimits for any of these substances. For the 14 substances in this group,OSHA finds that the available toxicological data are insufficient to meetthe increased burden of proof appropriate when the raising of an exposurelimit is under consideration. For these substances, OSHA is therefore notrevising its PELs at this time.The following discussion summarizes OSHA's analyses and findings for eachof the 14 substances in this group.<ITAG tagnum="71">CAMPHOR (SYNTHETIC)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 76-22-2; Chemical Formula: C<T2>10</T2>H<T2>16</T2>O</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1063</ITAG>In the NPRM (53 FR 21029), OSHA inadvertently indicated that its currentlimit for synthetic camphor is 2 ppm as an 8-hour TWA; however, the limitpreviously listed in 29 CFR 1910.1000, Table Z-1 (which is shown on TableZ-1-A of this final rule) was 2 mg/m3, or approximately 0.3 ppm. The ACGIHTLVs for camphor are a 2-ppm (12-mg/m3) TWA with a 3-ppm (18-mg/m3) STEL.This misrepresentation of the Agency's existing limit made the ACGIH limitsappear more protective by comparison, and thus OSHA erroneously proposedto revise the PEL upward, an action that would constitute a relaxing ofthe current 2-mg/m3 TWA PEL. Consequently, OSHA has reconsidered its discussionof the evidence on synthetic camphor. In the final rule, OSHA is retainingits 2-mg/m3 (0.3-ppm) TWA PEL; NIOSH's comments (Ex. 8-47) on the proposalsupport this decision. Synthetic camphor is a colorless or white crystallinesubstance with an aromatic odor.Synthetic camphor is known to cause severe injuries in animals exposedfor prolonged periods by inhalation to a level of 6 mg/m3. Exposure maycause convulsions, congestion, changes in the gastrointestinal tract, anddamage to the kidneys and brain (Flury and Zernik 1931b/Ex. 1-996). Animalbioassays showed that camphor was not carcinogenic in rats injected subcutaneously;however, when the cancer promoter, croton oil, was concurrently appliedto the skin of mice, 2 of 110 treated mice developed carcinomas (Graffi,Vlamynck, Hoffman, and Schultz 1953/Ex. 1-903).In humans, there are reports of industrial exposure to camphor that resultedin coma, dyspnea, and headache; one fatality from inhalation of the vaporhas been noted (Flury and Zernik 1931b/Ex. 1-996).The basis for ACGIH adopting the 2-ppm TLV-TWA and 3-ppm TLV-STEL is areport by Gronka, Bobkoski, Tomchick and Rakow (1969/Ex. 1-1043), whichevaluated airborne exposures and the health status of six employees ina synthetic-camphor-processing plant. The authors reported that exposurefor up to 10 months did not produce eye or nasal irritation if concentrationsof camphor were maintained at or below 2 ppm. The investigators recommendedthat the former TLV of 2 mg/m3 be revised to 2 ppm (12 mg/m3).The health status of the six employees was determined before the plantinstalled local ventilation and improved handling procedures; at that time,camphor concentrations ranged from 24 to 43 mg/m3. Four of the six employeesexamined showed inflammation of the nose and throat, and one reported havingoccasional numbness in the fingers. After process improvements were installed,only two of the employees were still working in the camphor-processingarea; the remaining four had been away from direct contact with camphor.OSHA concludes that the results of this study provide an inadequate basisfor increasing the 2-mg/m3 PEL to 12 mg/m3 (2 ppm). The small number ofemployees examined by Gronka et al. (1969/Ex. 1-1043) and the lack of comprehensivemedical examinations after exposures declined to 2 ppm provide no assurancethat long-term exposure to 2 ppm is not associated with adverse healtheffects. In addition, the animal study conducted by Flury and Zernik (1931b/Ex.1-996) demonstrated severe effects in animals exposed for prolonged periodsto a level one-half that found in the plant studied by Gronka et al. (1969/Ex.1-1043). Therefore, OSHA concludes that establishing the 2-ppm (12-mg/m3)limit is unwarranted, and the Agency is retaining its 2-mg/m3 (0.3-ppm)limit for synthetic camphor in the final rule. No comments, other thanthose made by NIOSH, were submitted to the record.<ITAG tagnum="71">COPPER (FUME)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-50-8; Chemical Formula: Cu</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1101</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for copper fume is 0.1 mg/m\3\ as an 8-hour TWA.Since OSHA adopted this limit in 1971, the ACGIH has increased the recommendedTLV to 0.2 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA. The ACGIH's previously recommended TLVof 0.1 mg/m\3\ was based on a personal communication (Whitman 1957 and1962, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 146) that reported that the tasteperception of welders was altered when they were exposed to copper fumeat levels ranging from 1 to 3 mg/m3 for short periods but that exposureto from 0.02 to 0.4 mg/m3 did not cause such complaints (ACGIH 1966/Ex.1-13). At the time, the ACGIH judged the 0.1-mg/m3 TLV to be ``sufficientlylow to provide freedom from irritation from the fume by a reasonable margin''(ACGIH 1966/Ex. 1-13). NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs that OSHA's 0.1=mg/m\3\limit is appropriate. Copper is a reddish-colored metal.In 1972, the ACGIH received a personal communication from a member of theU.K. Industrial Hygiene Unit, Her Majesty's Factory Inspectorate (Luxon1972, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 146) reporting that employeesexposed to copper fume at levels up to 0.4 mg/m3 during welding and coppermetal refining operations experienced no ill effects from exposure. Basedon this additional evidence, the ACGIH increased its TLV for copper fumeto 0.2 mg/m3 in 1975.Commenters to the docket urged OSHA to revise the PEL for copper fume tothe ACGIH limit. BP America (Ex. 8-57; Tr. pp. 9-126 to 9-127) argued thatthe Agency should increase its PEL even though the only basis for doingso was a personal communication to the ACGIH TLV Committee. In responseto these commenters, OSHA reiterates the position described in the introductionto this section (i.e., that the Agency must demonstrate that exposed workerswill not be placed at increased risk even <T3>after </T3>the limit has been raised). Because the personal communicationon which the ACGIH has based its increased limit cannot be examined todetermine information of this type, OSHA cannot consider raising the limitat this time.OSHA concludes that the evidence cited by the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3) in supportof the increase in its TLV-TWA for copper fume is not sufficient to supportan increase in OSHA's PEL for this substance. OSHA reasons that the ACGIH'saction was based largely on a personal communication, which makes it impossiblefor the Agency to evaluate the evidence appropriately.<ITAG tagnum="71">1,1-DICHLOROETHANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-34-3; Chemical Formula: Ch<T2>3</T2>CHCl<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.R. No. 1126</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for 1,1-dichloroethane, which is a hepatotoxin,is 100 ppm TWA. The ACGIH TLV-TWA is 200 ppm, with a 250-ppm STEL: NIOSHhas no REL for this substance. The previous ACGIH TLV of 100 ppm was basedon the observation that 1,1-dichlorethane has an acute toxicity approximatelyhalf that of carbon tetrachloride and a chronic toxicity somewhat lessthan that of carbon tetrachloride (for which a TLV of 10 ppm had been set).In 1973, the ACGIH adopted the higher 200-ppm TLV based on unpublisheddata from the Dow Chemical Company (AIHA 1971, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 184) showing that rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and dogs exhibitedno gross or microscopic organ pathology after exposure to 500 or 1000 ppmof 1,1-dichloroethane for six months. The ACGIH cited no human data insupport of its increase in the TLV. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concursthat OSHA's 100-ppm 8-hour TWA is appropriate. OSHA received no other commentson 1,1-dichloroethane.Because no human toxicity data are available for 1,1-dichloroethane andbecause the Dow data are unpublished and thus not available for scrutiny,OSHA concludes that the evidence for this substance is insufficient towarrant increasing the PEL at this time.<ITAG tagnum="71">FLUORINE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7782-41-4; Chemical Formula: F</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1179</ITAG>OSHA's current PEL for fluorine is 0.1 ppm; NIOSH has no REL for fluorine.In 1973, the ACGIH revised its TLV to 1 ppm and, subsequent to that change,adopted a TLV-STEL of 2 ppm. OSHA proposed these ACGIH limits of 1 ppmTWA and 2 ppm STEL; however, the final rule retains the Agency's existing0.1-ppm TWA limit. Fluorine is a pale yellow gas with a pungent irritatingodor.The ACGIH's previous 0.1-ppm TLV, which was adopted by OSHA in 1971, wasbased on a 30-day inhalation study in rats and dogs (Stokinger 1949b, ascited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 274) in which no consistent pulmonary,renal, or blood effects were observed following exposure to 0.5 ppm. TheACGIH believed that a TLV of 0.1 ppm would ``provide a working environmentof probable safety from the effects of F<T2>2</T2>'' (ACGIH 1966/Ex. 1-13). Subsequently, the ACGIH reviewed aseven-year study (Lyon 1962/Ex. 1-639) of 61 workers exposed to fluorineconcentrations ``far in excess of 0.1 ppm'' (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 2274),whichreported a lack of significant medical findings. This evidence, along withmore recent animal evidence (Keplinger and Suissa 1968/Ex. 1-342) suggestingthat animals were not as sensitive to fluorine as was reported by Stokinger(1949b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 274), led the ACGIH to increaseits TLV to 1 ppm. The STEL of 2 ppm was supported by a study (Ricca 1970/Ex.1-357) in which human volunteers repeatedly exposed to 10 ppm reportedonly slight-irritation.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N2) submitted extensive comments to the record criticizingthe ACGIH's reasoning in raising the limit for fluorine. NIOSH concluded:<ITAG tagnum="21">[T]here is no data existing to support raising the limit. The Lyon(1962/Ex. 1-639) study is severely limited and a review of the actual paperindicates [that] it has far less value than reported in the ACGIH documentation.All the animal data is, in fact, consistent with the original exposuredata on which the 0.1-ppm level was based (Ex. 8-47, p. 3).</ITAG>OSHA agrees with NIOSH and has determined that it is not appropriate, ashad originally been proposed by the Agency, to increase the limit for fluorineat this time. OSHA concludes that the human and animal evidence is inadequateto support an increase in the 8-hour TWA for this substance from 0.1 ppmto 1 ppm. OSHA is therefore retaining its PEL of 0.1 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.<ITAG tagnum="71">HEXACHLOROETHANE</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 67-72-1: Chemical Formula: CCl<T2>3</T2>CCl<T2>3</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1197</ITAG>OSHA's current PEL for hexachloroethane is a 1-ppm TWA, with a skin notation,which was adopted from the 1968 ACGIH TLV. The NIOSH REL for this substanceis the lowest feasible level, based on hexachloroethane's potential carcinogenicity.Hexachloroethane is a nonflammable white solid. The basis for the 1-ppm TLV was to prevent the ``serious injury potentialto several organ systems'' shown by animal studies (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 301). Subsequently, the ACGIH revised its TLV upward to 10 ppm based,in part, on a study by Weeks, Angerhofer, Bishop et al. (1979/Ex. 1-400)that reported no adverse effects among several animal species exposed dailyto 15- or 48-ppm concentrations of hexachloroethane. The ACGIH also citedan NCI study (NCI 1978b/Ex. 1-949), in which ``extremely heavy dosages. . . administered continuously for a long period of time'' resulted inthe development of hepatocellular tumors in mice but not in rats. The 10-ppmTLV was further supported by a personal communication of a TLV Committeemember who reported that no ill effects occurred among workers ``who handledthe material with few precautions'' during World War II (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 301). No exposure data were supplied to support this personal communication.In 1978, NIOSH reviewed the results of an NCI (1978b/Ex. 1-949) bioassayin which hexachloroethane was administered by gavage to mice and rats.Both male and female mice exhibited an excess incidence of hepatocellularcarcinoma, but rats did not. NCI concluded that early mortality may haveobscured detection of a carcinogenic effect in rats (NCI 1978b/Ex. 1-949).Toxic kidney damage was also found in mice and rats treated with hexachloroethane.Based on this evidence, NIOSH (<T3>Chloroethanes: Review of Toxicity,</T3> Current Intelligence Bulletin27, NIOSH 1978r) has recommended that exposure to hexachloroethane be maintainedat the lowest detectable level. Several participants (Exs. 3-678, 116, 144, and 194; Tr. pp. 9-149, 9-218)commented on hexachloroethane. The New Jersey Department of Health (Ex.144) discussed the use of ERA's IRIS system to determine limits (OSHA'sdiscussion of this approach is presented in Section V1.A of this preamble).The Workers Institute of Safety and Health (WISH) (Ex. 116; Tr. p. 9-218)and the AFL-CIO (Ex. 194) stated that the ACGIH's increase in the limitfor hexachloroethane reflects an inappropriate use of safety factors; WISHwas also of the opinion that OSHA should have performed a quantitativerisk assessment for hexachloroethane. In response to WISH, OSHA notes:(1) That the Agency is not following the ACGIH's move to a higher limitfor hexachloroethane; and (2) that OSHA performed risk assessments onlyfor those substances classified in the carcinogen section of this preamble.Lawrence Hecker, Corporate Director of Industrial Hygiene and Toxicologyfor Abbott Laboratories (Ex. 3-678; Tr. p. 9-1149) stated that the skinnotation should not be retained for hexachloroethane because this materialis not systematically toxic via dermal absorption. However, in accordancewith the Agency's policy on skin notations (see Section VI.C.18 of thispreamble), OSHA is retaining a skin notation for hexachloroethane in thefinal rule.OSHA concludes that the evidence relied on by the ACGIH is not adequateto support raising the PEL at this time. The human evidence cited by theACGIH is anecdotal and lacks the exposure data necessary to permit OSHAto assess whether significant risk is absent (and likely to remain so)at the 10-ppm exposure level. In addition, OSHA is concerned, as is NIOSH(Ex. 8-47, Table N6A), about the development of tumors in hexachloroethane-exposedmice demonstrated in the NCI (1978b/Ex. 1-949) study. OSHA therefore retainsits PEL of 1 ppm TWA, with a skin notation, and concludes that increasingthe PEL for hexachloroethane would increase the significant risk of cancerpotentially associated with exposure to this substance.<ITAG tagnum="71">NICKEL CARBONYL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 13463-39-3; Chemical Formula: Ni(CO)<T2>4</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1284</ITAG>The current OSHA PEL and the NIOSH recommended limit for nickel carbonylis 0.001 ppm TWA, as Ni. Nickel carbonyl is a gaseous compound at ordinarypressure or a colorless, highly volatile liquid, with a musty odor. In1976, the ACGIH increased its TLV for nickel carbonyl from 0.001 to 0.05ppm. The ACGIH's former 0.001-ppm TLV was based primarily on the high incidenceof nasal and lung cancer among workers exposed to nickel carbonyl duringwork in nickel refinery operations. In addition, the ACGIH cited evidence(Sunderman, West, and Kincaid 1959/Ex. 1-384) that rats exposed to nickelcarbonyl developed lung tumors that metastasized to the kidneys. At thetime, the ACGIH (1966/Ex. 1-13) noted that these tumors were not of a typegenerally associated with exposure to environmental agents.In its 1976 documentation for the 0.05-ppm TLV for nickel carbonyl, theACGIH cited the work of Doll, Morgan, and Speizer (1970/Ex. 1-821), whoevaluated the exposures of nickel refinery workers in whom cancers hadbeen found. Doll and associates (1970/Ex. 1-821) found that there had beenno exposures to nickel carbonyl in the facility, and this finding led theACGIH to conclude that nickel carbonyl was not the causative agent of thecancers reported among the refinery workers in the earlier studies it hadrelied on to set the 0.001-ppm TLV. A report that no excess nasal or lungtumors had occurred among workers exposed over a 50-year period in a nickelrefinery in Wales (Renzoni, personal communication, 1975, as cited in <T3>Documentation of the Threshold Limit Values for Substances in WorkroomAir, </T3>3rd ed., ACGIH 1976) appeared to the ACHIH to corroborate Dollet al.'s (1970/Ex. 1-821) results. The ACGIH concluded that the TLV fornickel carbonyl should be raised based on the acute, systemic effects ofthis substance, and that carcinogenicity was not an appropriate basis forlimit-setting (ACGIH 1976). In the 1986 <T3>Documentation </T3> for the 0.05-ppm TLV for nickel carbonyl, the ACGIH(Ex. 1-3) concluded that, ``although the evidence that nickel carbonylis carcinogenic to humans is inconclusive, this recommended TLV (i.e.,one set at 0.05 ppm) is also adequate to minimize any potential carcinogeniceffects'' (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 424).OSHA received comments on nickel carbonyl from NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A)and from Inco United States, Inc. and Inco Limited (Exs. 3-915 and 167).Inco urged OSHA to adjust the PEL for nickel carbonyl to 0.05 ppm and alsostated that the limit for this substance should not be enforced until anadequate sampling and analytical method has been developed. On this issueof the health basis for an increase in the PEL, OSHA notes that Inco, likethe ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3), believes that it is appropriate to increase thislimit on the sole basis of results of negative epidemiological studiesand a personal communication attesting to the absence of a ``significantpositive association with risk'' in a Welsh refinery. However, as describedin the introduction to this section, OSHA must meet a more stringent testbefore raising a limit. In addition, the interpretation of negative studiesin humans is complicated by a host of factors (see Section V1.A of thispreamble).As to Inco's second point, OSHA notes that it has an in-house samplingand analytical method for nickel carbonyl that is available from the Agencyon request. In addition, the limit for nickel carbonyl at issue is thelimit that was assigned to this substance in 1971, at the time the Agencywas established. OSHA is not required to perform feasibility analyses onits existing limits, and the Agency is unaware of any unusual compliancedifficulties with this substance.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N6A) concurs that retention of OSHA's limit is appropriatebecause NIOSH regards nickel carbonyl as a potential occupational carcinogen.Thus, OSHA finds the evidence discussed by the ACGIH insufficient to warrantan increase in the limit; some of this evidence is in the form of a personalcommunication. The Agency concludes that increasing the limit for thissubstance would increase the significant risk for exposed workers. In thefinal rule, OSHA is therefore retaining the existing PEL for nickel carbonylof 0.001 ppm as an 8-hour TWA.<ITAG tagnum="71">RHODIUM COMPOUNDS (METAL FUME; SOLUBLE AND INSOLUBLE SALTS)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-16-6: Chemical Formula: Rh</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1347; 1348</ITAG>The current OSHA PEL for rhodium metal fume and insoluble salts is 0.1mg/m3 as Rh; the current PEL for soluble rhodium compounds is 0.001 mg/m3as Rh. Rhodium is a silvery white, hard, ductile, and malleable metal.The ACGIH recommends a 1-mg/m3 TLV for rhodium metal and insoluble saltsand a 0.01-mg/m3 TLV for soluble rhodium salts. The current OSHA PELs forrhodium compounds (i.e., the 1968 ACGIH TLVs) were based on the then-existingTLVs for platinum because of concern that exposure to rhodium might beassociated with respiratory sensitization effects. This concern was prevalentbecause rhodium belongs to the platinum family of metals and because thetoxicologic data on rhodium that were formerly available were ``meager''(ACGIH 1966/Ex. 1-13).The ACGIH's decision to increase the TLVs for rhodium compounds was basedprimarily on a personal communication to the TLV Committee (Johnson, Mattheyand Co., Ltd. 1981b, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 512). This communicationindicated that, in a major precious metals refinery, ``procedures whichwere abandoned for the refining of platinum because of cases of sensitizationhave been carried out for a year with analogous rhodium compounds withoutany problems'' (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 512). In addition, the ACGIH notedthat none of the substances in the platinum group was known to producerespiratory effects similar to those of platinum. The ACGIH reported thatrhodium exhibited ``slight'' carcinogenic activity in mice (ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3). After considering all of this evidence, the ACGIH judged the previoiusTLVs to be inappropriate and increased them tenfold.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs that OSHA should retain its PELs forthese substances. No other comments on rhodium were received. OSHA concludesthat the evidence adduced by the ACGIH is not sufficient to meet the standardof proof the Agency must achieve before it can raise an exposure limit.This conclusion is based on that fact that the ACGIH relied heavily ona personal communication when making its decision, and no exposure or otherdata are available to support the ACGIH's action. Thus OSHA is unable toadequately evaluate the toxicologic evidence pertaining to the rhodiumcompounds and retains the existing PELs for rhodium metal fume and insolublesalts (0.1 mg/m\3\ TWA) and rhodium soluble salts (0.001 mg/m\3\ TWA).<ITAG tagnum="71">SILICA, AMORPHOUS_DIATOMACEOUS EARTH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 68855-54-9; Chemical Formula: Si0<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1352</ITAG>OSHA's current limit for amorphous silica is 20 mppcf, which is equivalentto 6 mg/m\3\ TWA (ACGIH 1984), measured as total dust. The ACGIH has establisheda limit for this dust (measured as total dust) of 10 mg/m\3\ (8-hour TLV-TWA).Amorphous silica (diatomaceous earth) is composed of the skeletons of prehistoricplants known as diatoms. These skeletons are largely noncrystalline, althoughdiatomaceous earth can contain varying amounts of crystalline quartz, whichhas led, in the opinion of the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 520), to conflictingresults in studies of the pulmonary effects of exposure to this colorlessto gray, odorless powder.Cooper and Cralley (1958-Ex. 1-1145) reported ``doubtful'' linear-nodularchanges in the lungs of workers exposed only to amorphous (noncrystalline)silica for five years or more. Other studies (Vigliani and Mottura 1948/Ex.1-534; Gardner 1942, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 520) either foundmild silicosis only or no evidence of serious lung pathology in diatomiteworkers. Kovalevich (1957, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 520) reportedsilicosis in diatomite workers, but intratracheal instillation of diatomaceousearth dust in animals caused evidence of fibrosis (Gardner 1942, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 520) and silicosis (Kovalevich 1957, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 520). Another study (Tebbens and Beard 1957/Ex.1-531) exposed guinea pigs to this substance at an average concentrationof 60 mg/m\3\ for 37 to 50 weeks and found both accumulations of dust-ladenmacrophages and alveolar epithelialization but no fibrosis.In setting its limit for diatomaceous earth, the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p.520) assumed that this substance itself is either ``weakly fibrogenic ornonfibrogenic,'' and thus that those studies discussed above that reportadverse pulmonary effects actually involved exposure to diatomaceous earthhaving an unmeasured but significant crystalline quartz content. Basedon this reasoning, the ACGIH considers amorphous silica (diatomaceous earth)to have low biological activity.OSHA received few comments on its proposal to retain the 6-mg/m\3\ PELfor diatomaceous earth. The Synthetic Amorphous Silica and Silicates IndustryAssociation (SASSI) (Ex. 1-630) requested that OSHA revise its entry for``silica, amorphous, diatomaceous earth'' to ``silica, crystalline, diatomaceousearth'' to reflect the fact that diatomaceous earth frequently containscrystalline silica. OSHA intends the PEL for crystalline quartz of 0.1mg/m\3\ to apply to diatomaceous earth containing more than 1 percent crystallinesilica. For clarification, OSHA has added the designation ``containingless than 1 percent crystalline silica'' to the entry for diatomaceousearth on Table Z-1-A of the final rule, for which the 6-mg/m\3\ limit isapplicable.SASSI also suggested that the crystalline silica PEL apply to any silicatescontaining more than 0.1 percent, rather than 1 percent, crystalline silicabecause of recent concerns regarding the potential carcinogenicity of silica.As discussed in the section on crystalline silica (see Section VI.C.6),OSHA has not made a final determination on the carcinogenicity of silica;therefore, at this time, OSHA will apply the limits for silicates to thosematerials containing less than 1 percent silica.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) concurred with the 6-mg/m3 TWA PEL for diatomaceous earth,provided the silica content does not exceed 1 percent. Chevron Corporation(Ex. 3-896) also agreed with OSHA's proposal. Both Chevron (Ex. 3-896)and SASSI (Ex. 3-630) agreed that the former mppcf limit should be revisedto a limit expressed as mg/m3, since the use of mppcf units is outdated.OSHA is retaining an 8-hour TWA of 6 mg/m3 (equivalent to 20 mppcf) forthis form of silica. OSHA finds that the health evidence for this substanceis not sufficiently persuasive to permit an increase in the limit at thepresent time. The Agency is revising the units in which its permissibleexposure limit for diatomaceous earth is expressed; this change is beingmade to facilitate the accurate monitoring of employee exposures and doesnot represent a change in the value of the limit.<ITAG tagnum="71">SILICA, AMORPHOUS, PRECIPITATED AND GEL</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"> CAS: None; Chemical Formula: SiO<T2>2</T2></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1353</ITAG>OSHA currently has a limit of 20 mppcf (which is equivalent to a limitof 6 mg/m3) for amorphous silica. The ACGIH recommends a TLV-TWA of 10mg/m3 measured as total dust containing less than 1 percent quartz. OSHAis retaining the current PEL in the final rule but is expressing this limitin milligrams per cubic meter; NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs withthe Agency's decision. There are numerous methods of producing precipitatedsilica; those that apply heat to siliceous products produce airborne duststhat are less toxic than quartz dust because the particles are generallysheathed in a molecular layer of amorphous silica (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 521).Studies of laboratory animals have shown no fibrosis after intratrachealand intraperitoneal injection of precipitated silica or silica gel (Klosterkotter1954/Ex. 1-1156; Klosterkotter 1958/Ex. 1-1039). Schepers and colleaguesreported in 1957 that rats exposed for one year and guinea pigs and rabbitsexposed for two years to a concentration of 126 mg/m3 of precipitated amorphoussilica displayed no pulmonary fibrosis; the effects of exposure were limitedto macrophage accumulations and mild proliferation of reticulin fibers(Schepers, Durkan, Delahant et al. 1957/Ex. 1-755).In a study of human exposures to precipitated amorphous silica, Wilsonand associates reported no ill effects in 165 workers exposed for an averageof 8.6 years (Wilson, Stevens, Lovejoy et al. 1981/Ex. 1-1177).The ACGIH considers the precipitated and gel forms of amorphous silicato have low biological activity, based on the evidence discussed above.PPG Industries (Ex. 3-1158) commented that an unpublished NIOSH study (Groth,Kommineni, Stettler et al. 1979, as cited by H.E. Stokinger in<T3> Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology,</T3> 3rd rev. ed., Vol.2B, pp. 3011-3014) showed that rats, guinea pigs, and monkeys developedaccumulations of macrophages in the lungs following exposure to precipitatedsilica. In addition, the presence of collagen was seen in ``very few''monkeys; by comparison, collagen was not seen in any animal exposed tosilica gel but was seen in significant amounts in monkeys exposed to fumedsilica. PPG remarked that the findings in animals exposed to precipitatedsilica showed ``no evidence for effects * * * which are inconsistent withthe ACGIH criteria for nuisance particulates'' (Ex. 3-1158). PPG urgedOSHA to adopt a 10-mg/m3 PEL for precipitated silica based on this observation.SASSI (Ex. 3-630) also requested that OSHA adopt either a 10-mg/m3 totaldust limit or a 5-mg/m3 respirable dust limit for precipitated silica,based on the recommendation of ASTM's E34.16 Committee.After reviewing these comments, OSHA concludes that the available evidencedoes not meet the criteria described earlier in this section for determiningthat an increase in the present PEL is warranted. OSHA notes that, in thestudy cited by PPG, there was collagen formation only in a few animalsexposed to precipitated silica. Furthermore, the report by Wilson et al.(1981/Ex. 1-1177) involved only a relatively small number of employeeswho had been exposed for fewer than 10 years. Accordingly, OSHA is retainingits current PEL of 6 mg/m3 (equivalent to 20 mppcf) at the present time.However, to facilitate the accurate monitoring of employee exposures, theAgency is changing the units in which its permissible exposure limit foramorphous silica is expressed.<ITAG tagnum="71">SILVER (METAL DUST AND FUME)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-22-4; Chemical Formula: Ag</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1362</ITAG>The current OSHA standard for silver metal and soluble compounds (includingthe metal dust and fume) is 0.01 mg/m3, as Ag. NIOSH has no REL for thissubstance, but the ACGIH has established a 0.1-mg/m3 TLV for silver metaldust and fume. NIOSH concurs with OSHA's decision not to increase the limitfor silver (Ex. 8-47). Silver is a hard, brilliant, white, ductile, malleablemetal.The previous TLV of 0.01 mg/m3, which was established for all forms ofsilver, was designed to protect workers against developing argyria. Thiscondition arises from the accumulation of silver in the body and resultsin an unsightly, widespread blue-grey discoloration of the skin that canpersist for long periods of time. The skin of exposed workers may alsobecome black and have a metallic luster. Argyria may manifest in the conjunctivaof the eye, which may be affected sufficiently to cause lens and visualdisturbances.In arriving at the previous TLV of 0.01 mg/m3 for silver, the ACGIH reliedon a publication by Pillsbury and Hill (1939, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 529), which stated that an accumulated intake of from 1 to 5 gramsof silver would lead to generalized argyria. Assuming a 20-year exposureduration, a 10-m3/day respiratory volume, and a 50-percent body retention,the ACGIH estimated that exposure to 0.05 mg/m3 was sufficient to causeargyria. The former TLV of 0.01 mg/m3 thus appeared to incorporate a safetyfactor to account for the uncertainties involved in using this approachto develop a TLV. The ACGIH's current TLV of 0.1 mg/m3 for silver metaldust and fume was determined in a similar fashion, except that the ACGIHassumed a lower percent retention and apparently did not incorporate asafety margin (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3).OSHA received several comments on its proposal to retain the existing limitfor silver (Ex. 8-47, 8-57, 3-876, 46, and 105; Tr. pp. 9-126 to 9-127).The American Mining Congress (Ex. 3-876) stated that argyria, the blue-greydiscoloration of the skin caused by exposure to silver, is caused onlyby exposure to the soluble silver salts and not by metallic silver. BPAmerica, a company that operates a silver smelting and refining operationin Utah, is also of the opinion that OSHA should increase its limit forsilver (metal, dust, and fumes) because, although argyria ``can be cosmeticallyunpleasant, it is not known to result in any adverse health consequences''(Ex. 8-57).OSHA responds to these commenters as follows. First, OSHA does not agreethat having one's skin discolored, on a semipermanent basis, is a ``minor''effect. On the contrary, OSHA believes that argyria causes emotional stress,acute personal discomfort, and feelings of insecurity, all of which aresymptoms of severe psychological distress.In addition, although the American Mining Congress is certain that onlythe soluble forms cause argyria, OSHA notes that Wolf Wagner, Manager ofIndustrial Hygiene for BP America, expressed uncertainty on this pointat the hearing; he reported that argyria is ``most likely due to a solublesilver rather than an insoluble silver'' (Ex. 8-57; Tr. pp. 9-126 to 9-127).OSHA agrees that considerable uncertainty surrounds the issues of the causativeagents of argyria and the specific level at which this effect occurs. Asthe ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 529) reports:<ITAG tagnum="21">The concentration of silver in the air which will result in generalizedargyria is not known with certainty.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Thus, OSHA concludes that the evidence needed to raise the limit forsilver is lacking. OSHA is therefore retaining its former limit for silver(metal, dust, and fume) of 0.01 mg/m3 as an 8-hour TWA.<ITAG tagnum="71">TETRAETHYL LEAD (TEL)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 78-00-2; Chemical Formula: (C<T2>2</T2>H<T2>5</T2>)<T2>4</T2>Pb</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1386</ITAG>OSHA's current 8-hour limit for tetraethyl lead is 0.075 mg/m3, measuredas lead, with a skin notation; NIOSH has no REL for this substance. TheACGIH is now recommending that worker exposure to TEL not exceed 0.1 mg/m3TWA; the ACGIH also recommends a skin notation. Tetraethyl lead is a colorlessliquid, which may be dyed red, orange, or blue, and has a slightly mustyodor.The previous TLV of 0.075 mg/m3 was based almost exclusively on a personalcommunication from the Medical Department of the Ethyl Corporation, whichstated that a level of 0.075 mg/m3 ``is a good guideline for an allowableair concentration of TEL'' (ACGIH 1966/Ex. 1-13). The ACGIH documentationfor the 0.075-mg/m3 TLV also pointed out that the ability of tetraethyllead to penetrate the skin ``makes reliance on the airborne concentrationimpractical in many situations,'' and that urinary lead levels are a morereliable indicator of exposure than blood lead levels (ACGIH 1966/Ex. 1-13).In its documentation for the 0.1-mg/m\3\ TLV, the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 563) again cited the communication from the Ethyl Corporation. In addition,the organization cited a personal communication from Linch (1968, as citedin ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 563), who reported that an improved analyticalprocedure for measuring airborne concentrations of tetraethyl lead hadbeen used to determine the relationship between airborne tetraethyl leadlevels and urinary lead levels. He reported that urinary lead concentrationwas not significantly elevated ``above a high normal'' value (0.15 mg/L)when the airborne TEL level was 121 andCx.18;g/m\3\ (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3,p. 563). As a result of this communication, the ACGIH adopted a revisedTLV of 0.1 mg/m\3\ in 1970. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs that OSHA should retain its existinglimit for TEL; no other comments on this substance were submitted.OSHA does not find the evidence presented by the ACGIH to be sufficientlycomprehensive or detailed to permit significant risk to be ruled out atthe 0.1-ppm level. The Agency is also reluctant to increase the PEL forTEL in light of this substance's ability to be absorbed percutaneously.OSHA is therefore retaining the existing PEL of 0.075 mg/m\3\, measuredas Pb and with a skin notation, for tetraethyl lead. <ITAG tagnum="71">TETRAMETHYL LEAD (TML)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 75-74-1; Chemical Formula: (CH<T2>3</T2>)<T2>4</T2>Pb</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1388</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for tetramethyl lead (TML) is 0.075 mg/m\3\ TWA,with a skin notation, while the ACGIH has recommended a TLV of 0.15 mg/m\3\,measured as Pb and with a skin notation. There is no NIOSH REL for TML.Tetraethyl lead is a colorless liquid, which may be dyed blue, orange,or red; it has a slight musty odor. In establishing the previous TLV of 0.15 mg/m\3\, the ACGIH cited the workof de Treville, Wheeler, and Sterling (1962/Ex. 1-310), who reported thattetramethyl lead is about three times more volatile than tetraethyl leadand thus results in airborne TML levels that are about three times higherthan those for TEL. Despite the heavier TML exposure of employees, urinarylead levels were not significantly different from the urinary lead levelsof employees exposed to TEL. The ACGIH concluded that a 0.075-mg/m\3\ TLVfor TML, identical to the TLV recommended at the time for TEL, should furnishan adequate margin of safety. The revised TLV of 0.15 mg/m\3\ was basedon a personal communication by Linch (1968, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.1-3, p. 563), who reported that exposure to 0.179 mg/m\3\ tetramethyl leadwas not associated with a significant increase in urinary lead levels.NIOSH concurs (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) that the retention of the Agency's 0.075-mg/m\3\limit is appropriate, and no other comments on TML were received. Basedon the same reasoning as that described above in connection with tetraethyllead, OSHA is not increasing its existing TWA limit for TML; the skin notationfor TML is also retained. <ITAG tagnum="71">URANIUM (SOLUBLE COMPOUNDS)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">CAS: 7440-61-1; Chemical Formula: U</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">H.S. No. 1419</ITAG>The current OSHA limit for soluble uranium compounds is 0.05 mg/m\3\ TWA,measured as uranium. NIOSH has no REL for soluble uranium compounds. Since1968, the ACGIH has increased its TLV for soluble uranium from 0.05 mg/m\3\to 0.2 mg/m\3\, with a 0.6-mg/m\3\ STEL. The previous TLV of 0.05 mg/m\3\was based on animal studies relating exposure level and duration to theresulting tissue concentration of uranium and on other chronic animal studiesshowing the kidney to be the most sensitive target organ. In 1968, theACGIH's<T3> List of Intended Changes</T3> included a TLV of 0.2 mg/m\3\ for allforms of uranium, and this value was dropped by the ACGIH in 1969. Thebasis for adopting the 0.2-mg/m\3\ TLV for soluble uranium compounds wasa study by Wing, Heatherton, and Quigley (1963, as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex.p. 617) reporting no adverse effects from radiation exposure over a 25-yearperiod. Although no data were discussed in the ACGIH (1986/Ex. 1-3)<T3> Documentation</T3> regarding typical exposure levels at the plantsstudied, the documentation does mention that seven accidental, brief exposuresto soluble uranium compounds at levels two- to fivefold the former TLVof 0.05 mg/m\3\ did not result in physiologic changes or significant bodyburden. Allied Signal, Inc. (Ex. 3-1084) is of the opinion that OSHA's limit forthe soluble compounds of uranium is ``unrealistically low based on NRC(Nuclear Regulatory Commission) and industry experience.'' This companystates that the fact that soluble uranium ``exits the body quite rapidly''means that it does not produce radiation-induced cancer. OSHA finds thatthis evidence is not sufficiently detailed to use as a basis for raisingits limit for these compounds, and NIOSH (Ex. 8-47, Table N1) concurs.OSHA does not find this evidence adequate to meet the Agency's more stringentstandard of proof for relaxing an existing exposure limit. In addition,OSHA notes that the 25-year period of observation in the Wing et al. (1963,as cited in ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 617) study is not long enough to ruleout the occurrence of some forms of radiation-induced cancer and, further,that the power of this study to detect health effects occurring in a smallpercentage of the population was very limited. OSHA is accordingly notraising its current PEL for the soluble uranium compounds. <ITAG tagnum="81">17. Substances for Which OSHA is Establishing Short-Term ExposureLimits </ITAG>IntroductionOSHA is establishing a short-term exposure limit (STEL) for a total of116 substances; these substances are listed in Table C17-1.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M004</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">insert illustration(s) 0 1462-1465</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>When OSHA adopted the ACGIH TLVs in 1971, the ACGIH had not establishedthe short-term TLV category; as a consequence, none of the substances onOSHA's Z-1 table have STELs. (Some of the substances on OSHA's currentZ-2 tables, whose limits derive from standards established by the AmericanNational Standards Institute rather than the ACGIH, have ``acceptable ceilingconcentrations'' that act, in effect, as short-term exposure limits.)The ACGIH defines a STEL as <ITAG tagnum="20">a 15-minute time-weighted average exposure which should not be exceededat any time during a work day even if the eight-hour time-weighted averageis within the TLV. Exposures at the STEL should not be longer than 15 minutesand should not be repeated more than four times per day. There should beat least 60 minutes between successive exposures at the STEL. An averagingperiod other than 15 minutes may be recommended when this is warrantedby observed biological effects (ACGIH 1987/Ex. 1-16).</ITAG>Basis UnderWhich ACGIH Established STELsThe ACGIH establishes STELs for substances that cause a wide variety ofacute effects; these effects include irritation, narcosis, lung damage,systemic effects, and organic poisoning. The ACGIH first considered addingSTELs to the TLV-TWAs for some substances in 1971 when it appointed a subcommitteeto study the appropriateness of adding such exposure limits to its TLVlist.In 1973, this subcommittee recommended that the ACGIH establish STELs asa third category (along with TLV-TWAs and TLV-ceilings) of exposure limits.The STEL was defined as the maximum concentration to which workers canbe exposed continuously <T3>for a period of up to 15 minutes</T3> without suffering from1. Intolerable irritation,2. Chronic or irreversible tissue change, or3. Narcosis of sufficient degree to increase accident proneness, impairself-rescue, or materially reduce work efficiency (<T3>Supplemental Documentation to the Fourth Edition of the Documentationof the Threshold Limit Values,</T3> ACGIH 1984).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The ACGIH stipulated that no more than four such excursions per daywere permissible, with at least 60 minutes between exposure periods, andthat the daily TLV-TWA could not be exceeded.In 1974, the ACGIH agreed by consensus that 425 of the 520 compounds inits 1973 list should have STELs assigned to them, but these were not infact published until 1976, when ``Tentative Values'' for STELs were listedin the organization's annual booklet. The 1987-1988 ACGIH TLV booklet statesthat the TLV-STEL is ``the concentration to which workers can be exposedcontinuously for a short period of time without suffering from (1) irritation,(2) chronic or irreversible tissue damage, or (3) narcosis of sufficientdegree to increase the likelihood of accidental injury, impair self-rescueor materially reduce work efficiency . . . provided that the daily TLV-TWAis not exceeded.''In 1982, the ACGIH qualified the conditions under which STELs are recommendedto ``only [those situations] where toxic effects have been reported fromhigh short-term exposures in either humans or animals.'' Since that time,the ACGIH has re-examined the toxicological data and subsequently deletedthe STELs for 297 substances because of insufficient evidence that adverseeffects result from acute exposures. The most recent (1988-1989) editionof the <T3>Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices</T3> (ACGIH1988b) proposes deletion of the short-term limit for an additional 18 substances.The ACGIH has stressed that STELs are set on physiological grounds ratherthan in response to sampling and analytical limitations (ACGIH 1984).Separate from the STEL category, the ACGIH in the 1970s established a fourthlimit, a general ``excursion factor'' that should always be observed implicitlybut is not specifically assigned to each chemical. The ``excursion limit''recommended by the ACGIH is defined as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Short-term exposures should exceed three times the TLV-TWA for nomore than a total of 30 minutes during a work day and under no circumstancesshould they exceed five times the TLV-TWA, provided that the TLV-TWA isnot exceeded (ACGIH 1987).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The basis for this excursion limit is that any process having emissionsthat display a variability greater than would be permitted by this excursionfactor is not under good industrial hygiene control, and the ACGIH believesthat, in such cases, efforts should be made to restore control (ACGIH 1986x).Where a specific STEL exists for a substance, the specific STEL takes precedenceover the general excursion limit (ACGIH 1987). Thus <T3>all</T3> ACGIH TLV-TWAs have implicit excursion limits, but only afew substances (i.e., those for which specific toxicological evidence indicatesthat a STEL is necessary) have explicit STELs.Basis for Short-Term Limits Being Promulgated by OSHAThe STELs being promulgated by OSHA in this rulemaking, which parallelthose STELs remaining in the ACGIH's most recent list (ACGIH 1987-1988)are thus limits for substances where there is toxicological evidence ofrecognized acute effects resulting from short-term exposure. The healtheffects associated with short-term exposures for some of these substancesare shown in Table C17-2.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 009</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">INSERT ILLUSTRATION(S) 01469-1477</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>OSHA received comments on the issue of STELs from many rulemaking participants(Exs. 3-217, 3-623, 3-678, 3-868, 3-891, 3-902, 3-904, 3-905, 3-1008, 3-1012,3-1053, 3-1057, 3-1099, and 3-1246; Tr. p. 3-333; Tr. pp. 10-12 to 10-14;Tr. p. 11-231), who expressed the opinion that STELs and ceiling limitsshould only be established when a toxicologic basis exists that demonstratethe need for a short-term limit. Many of these rulemaking participantsurged OSHA not to establish STELs for substances in this rulemaking, inview of the fact that the ACGIH is still evaluating the basis for its TLV-STELsand recently deleted the TLV-STELs for a number of substances.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) also discussed the basis under which short-term limits(called ``ceilings'' by NIOSH) are appropriate:<ITAG tagnum="21">Ceiling values are intended to minimize toxic effects related to thepeak exposure. Ceiling values are necessary when there are immediate acuteresponses to an air contaminant independent of the total daily dose orwhen chronic effects are dose-rate response related. Ceiling values arealso used to minimize the total daily dose when there is intermittent occupationalexposure, e.g., ethylene oxide (Ex. 8-47).</ITAG>The Workers' Institute for Safety and Health (WISH) had a similar viewof the need for short-term limits, and expressed the belief that OSHA shouldadopt some guidelines for decisionmaking in this area (Ex. 116).In the final rule, OSHA finds that the STELs and ceilings being establishedreflect the concerns of rulemaking participants that short-term limitsbe promulgated when a toxicologic basis exists for the short-term limit.In general, OSHA is establishing STELs or ceiling limits when the toxicologicevidence for a particular substance indicates that the 8-hour TWA PEL alonewould be insufficient to protect employees from experiencing adverse effectsrelated to short-term exposure to elevated concentrations of that substance.In making these determinations, OSHA has considered the record evidenceon specific short-term limits that were proposed (see discussions for individualsubstances).In addition, for substances for which the ACGIH has recently proposed deletingSTELs (ACGIH 1988b), OSHA has reevaluated the toxicologic basis for theSTELs proposed in the NPRM. Both as a result of this analysis and in responseto the record evidence on specific substances, OSHA is not establishingshort-term limits, as originally proposed, for the following substances:<ITAG tagnum="15">Acetic acid</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">sec-Butyl alcohol</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Camphor (synthetic)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">2-Chloro-6-trichloromethyl pyridine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chlorodifluoromethane</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">o-Chlorotoluene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Chlorpyrifos</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Clopidol</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Crufomate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Cyclonite</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Fluorine</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Oil mist</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Perchloroethylene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Phosphorus oxychloride</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Picloram</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Picric acid</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Propionic acid</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Tantalum</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Vinylidene chloride</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Zinc stearate</ITAG>For the remaining substances for which STELs or ceiling limits were proposed,OSHA has determined that the toxicologic evidence demonstrates that a short-termlimit is necessary to provide employee protection that would not otherwisebe provided by an 8-hour TWA limit alone.WISH (Ex. 116, p. 20) suggested that OSHA adopt a ``generic STEL'' applicableto all substances regulated by OSHA, similar to the general excursion limitrecommended by the ACGIH. Another commenter, the Chemical ManufacturersAssociation (CMA) (Tr. pp. 10-12 to 10-14), was not in favor of such aprovision because in CMA's view, a general excursion limit relates to statisticalvariability in sampling data rather than to toxicological factors.In the final rule, OSHA has not established a general excursion limit thatapplies to all regulated substances. However, there are workplace situationswhere OSHA believes that worker protection requires the implementationof a STEL. For example, OSHA believes that the severity of the health effectcaused by exposure and the pattern of exposure prevalent in operationsinvolving a given substance are both factors that should be consideredwhen determining whether a short-term limit is appropriate. OSHA concludesthat, in these instances, promulgating a STEL is a necessary and appropriatemeasure for ensuring that workplace conditions will be maintained undera sufficient degree of control to ensure that workers are protected fromexperiencing serious exposure-related health effects.<ITAG tagnum="81">18. Substances for Which OSHA Is Adding Skin Designations</ITAG>For 49 substances included in this rulemaking, OSHA is adding skin designationsin recognition of the capacity of these substances to be absorbed throughthe skin in sufficient quantities to cause systemic toxicity. Table C18-1shows all of the substances for which the Agency is establishing skin notations.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M003</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 0 1483-1485</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>The ACGIH began to include skin designations for the chemicals in its listfor the first time in 1961 (Stokinger 1962/Ex. 1-998). At that time, theorganization stated that:<ITAG tagnum="21">This notation is to be interpreted simply as an indicator that skinabsorption may contribute to the overall intake from exposure in additionto that from inhalation. It refers mainly to absorption from liquid contamination(Stokinger 1962/Ex. 1-998).</ITAG>The ACGIH has expanded on its reasoning since the 1960s, and the prefaceto the most recent <T3>Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices for 1987-1988</T3>(ACGIH 1987/Ex. 1-16) explains that the skin designation is designedto call attention to the need for ``appropriate measures for the preventionof cutaneous absorption so that the threshold limit is not invalidated''(ACGIH 1987/Ex. 1-16, p. 7). Thus, a skin notation warns that exposurevia the cutaneous route, including absorption through the eyes or mucousmembranes by either inhalation or direct contact, may contribute substantiallyto an employee's overall exposure and cause systemic toxicity. The ACGIH has a policy of using a dermal LD<T2>50</T2> of 2 g/kg as a general cutoff for determining when to classifya substance as sufficiently absorbable to present a hazard via the percutaneousroute; that is, substances having a single-dose dermal LD<T2>50</T2> of less than 2 g/kg receive a skin notation, while those withdermal LD<T2>50</T2>s above this cutoff do not (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3, p. 332). The<T3>Documentation </T3>(ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3) contains no cutoff value forchronic dermal exposures (i.e., for toxicity resulting from repeated applicationsof substances to the skin).OSHA proposed to include as paragraph 3[2] of the standard the followinglanguage regarding the use of skin notations:<ITAG tagnum="21">[2]. An employee's skin exposure to materials listed in the TableZ-4 with an ``S'' Notation shall be limited through the use of gloves,coveralls, goggles, or other appropriate personal protection equipmentor method necessary to prevent possible skin absorption.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The NPRM explained further that a skin designation is employed ``wherethe substance may be absorbed through the skin'' or ``where skin contactcould damage or irritate the skin.'' In addition, the NPRM mentioned thatboth engineering controls and work practices may be used to limit skinexposure, but that the hierarchy of controls, i.e., a preference for engineeringcontrols, would not be enforced in the case of skin notations.A number or rulemaking participants (Exs. 8-44, 8-64, 3-661, 3-678, 3-683,3-877, 3-891, 3-1008, and 3-1053; Tr. 8/1/88, pp. 304-305, 337; Tr. 8/9/88,pp. 136, 148) objected to the skin notation language contained in the Summaryand Explanation section (Section VII) of the NPRM and urged OSHA to enunciatea clear and consistent policy on the use of the skin designations.

In this rulemaking, OSHA's decision logic for establishingskin notations derives from the Agency's Hazard Communication Standard(29 CFR 1910.1200). Appendix A of that regulation defines, in measurableterms, the possible health effects that may occur in the workplace as aresult of chemical exposures. These definitions set forth quantitativeguidelines for determining if chemicals are ``highly toxic'' or merely``toxic'' by the dermal route of exposure. A chemical is considered <T3>highly toxic </T3>via skin absorption if<ITAG tagnum="20">. . . [it] has a median lethal dose (LD</ITAG><T2>50</T2>) of 200 milligrams or less per kilogram of body weight whenadministered by continuous contact for 24 hours (or less if death occurswithin 24 hours) with the bare skin of albino rabbits weighing betweentwo and three kilograms each.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">It is considered <T3>toxic </T3>via skin absorption if<ITAG tagnum="20">. . . [it] has a median lethal dose (LD</ITAG><T2>50</T2>) of more than 200 milligrams per kilogram but not more than1,000 milligrams per kilogram of body weight when administered by continuouscontact for 24 hours (or less if death occurs within 24 hours) with thebare skin of albino rabbits weighing between two and three kilograms each.Accordingly, OSHA has determined that a skin notation is necessary forsubstances that have median lethal dose (LD<T2>50</T2>) values in rabbits on single-dose applications of less than1000 mg/kg. In addition, in very rare cases where available data (for anyspecies) indicate that dermal contact results in a systemic dose that isequivalent to or greater than the dose that would be permitted by the PELvia inhalation, OSHA believes that a skin designation is warranted. Inaddition to this animal evidence, OSHA believes that the availability ofhuman data demonstrating that systemic injury has occurred as a resultof skin absorption is sufficient evidence that a skin notation is warranted.OSHA has followed these guidelines in establishing skin designations inthis rulemaking. As a consequence, the skin designations proposed in theNPRM for eight substances have been deleted in the final rule because theAgency found in its subsequent review of the record that the substancesfailed to meet the requisite animal and/or human criteria, thus demonstratingan absence of significant risk as a result of percutaneous absorption:<ITAG tagnum="15">Allyl glycidyl ether;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Captafol;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">2-N-Dibutylaminoethanol;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Diethylene triamine;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Hexachlorobutadiene;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Propyl alcohol;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1,2-Propylene glycol dinitrate; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1,2,3-Trichloropropane.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The evidence that OSHA finds acceptable in humans is, of course, impossibleto quantify in terms of laboratory measurements. For example, much of theinformation on the dermal toxicity of substances in humans is anecdotaland derives from accidental poisonings. Nevertheless, OSHA believes thatsuch evidence should constitute a sufficient basis for the establishmentof a skin designation. In addition, OSHA has added skin designations to a number of substanceswhere none were originally proposed if commenters submitted evidence tothe record that supported these additions. These substances are:<ITAG tagnum="15">Acrylic acid;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Carbon disulfide;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Catechol;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Disulfoton;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Isophorone diisocyanate;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Mercury (aryl and inorganic);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Methacrylic acid; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Sodium azide.</ITAG>Substances for which the ACGIH Has Deleted theSkin NotationFor four substances, the ACGIH has deleted the skin notations that appearedin the 1968 edition of the <T3>Documentation </T3>and that were subsequently adopted by OSHA underthe Section 6(a) mechanism in 1971. Table C18-2 shows these chemicals<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert Illus 01491A</ITAG>OSHA is retaining the skin notations for these four substances (DDT, dipropyleneglycol methyl ether, hexachloroethane, and paraquat). The Agency believesthat deletion of these designations would consititute an increase in thelevel of exposure permitted and would thus decrease the extent of workerprotection provided by OSHA. In accordance with principles establishedby OSHA (see the preamble for the final revisions to the cotton dust standard,50 <T3>FR </T3>51120 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Agency must demonstrate, on the basis of human data,that deleting these skin designations, which were established under the6(a) mechanism, will not pose a significant risk to exposed workers. Thediscussion below describes the ACGIH's reasons for recommending deletionof these notations. The evidence on which the ACGIH based its decision to delete skin notationsfor the four chemicals in question is primarily animal evidence. For DDTand hexachloroethane, the ACGIH deleted the skin designation based on therelatively low dermal toxicity demonstrated by these substances in animalstudies. OSHA concludes, however, that the absence of significant riskto humans via dermal absorption has not been sufficiently shown for eitherDDT or hexachloroethane. In the case of the latter substance, there areno human data with which to demonstrate an absence of risk, and to decreasethe amount of protection provided by the existing limit would not be appropriate.For the two remaining substances in this group, paraquat and dipropyleneglycol methyl ether (DPGME), the skin notation was deleted because theACGIH believes that the substance does not, in the case of paraquat, ``penetratethe unbroken or uninjured skin'' or believes, as in the case of DPGME,that the substance is ``practically nontoxic . . . by the dermal routefor rabbits'' (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3). However, OSHA notes that at high dosesparaquat does ``injure and break down dermal barriers'' and gain entryto the body. The <T3>Documentation</T3> records the case of a 44-year-old man who died ofrespiratory insufficiency after he was poisoned by the percutaneous absorptionof an acutely toxic quantity of undiluted paraquat (ACGIH 1986/Ex. 1-3).Therefore OSHA is retaining the skin notation for paraquat. In addition, the Agency notes that DPGME, applied essentially accordingto the method prescribed by Draize et al., was absorbed in sufficient quantitiesthrough rabbit skin to result in transient narcosis (<T3>Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology, </T3>Vol. 2C, p. 3990, Claytonand Clayton 1982). However, topical administration of only 10 mg/kg DPGMEfive times per week for 13 weeks to shaved rabbit skin caused six deathsamong seven animals (<T3>Chemical Hazards of the Workplace, </T3>2nd ed., p. 221, Proctor, Hughes,and Fischman 1988). In light of this evidence, OSHA believes that deletingthe skin notation for DPGME would be inappropriate, since the absence ofsignificant risk in humans cannot be clearly demonstrated. Consequently,OSHA is retaining the skin notation for this substance. In accordance with the principles stated in the cotton dust preamble (50<T3>FR </T3>51120), OSHA does not find the evidence adduced by the ACGIHsufficient to provide a basis for the deletion of the skin notations forthis group of four substances. The Agency concludes that deleting the skinnotation from the limits for DDT, dipropylene glycol methyl ether, hexachloroethane,and paraquat will not ensure that workers are protected against the significantrisk potentially posed by percutaneous absorption of these substances.D.

Introduction and Executive Summary<ITAG tagnum="81">Introduction</ITAG>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is amending itsexisting air contaminant standards at 29 CFR 1910.1000, Tables Z-1, Z-2,and Z-3. The amendments provide more protective permissible exposure limits(PELS) for about 230 substances, and set new exposure limits for 165 substancescurrently not regulated by OSHA. The PELs include time-weighted averagelimits, short term exposure limits, ceiling limits, and, in some cases,skin designations. No changes are being made to the PELs for 30 substances.<T3>Background. </T3>Congress enacted the Occupational Safety and HealthAct of 1970 (the Act) to achieve several goals, one of which was to protectworkers from occupational health hazards. Congress acknowledged the roleof occupational exposure in the development of diseases, and addressedin the Act the need to quickly establish minimum health standards to controlexposure to hazardous substances. To accomplish Congress' intent, OSHAadopted initial exposure limits for approximately 430 chemicals. Four hundredof these exposure limits were based on the recommendations of the AmericanConference of Governmnental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and 21 werefrom the American Standards Association (now called the American NationalStandards Institute). The list of exposure limits was to be updated, improved,and expanded as new knowledge and techniques were developed. To date OSHAhas promulgated extensive health standards for only 24 individual chemicals.The rulemaking under consideration here would set exposure limits for about430 chemicals based on the 1987-88 Threshold Limit Values of the ACGIH,and recommendations of the National Institute for Occupational Safety andHealth (NIOSH) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.The OSH Act requires the Agency to consider the feasibility of proposedand final standards. Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13197) requires thata regulatory analysis be conducted for any rule having major economic consequenceson the national economy, individual industries, geographical regions, orlevels of government. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.)similarly requires OSHA to consider the impact of the proposed and finalregulations on small entities. This analysis covers these requirements.<T3>Approach. </T3>Because this rulemaking involves about 430 chemicals,OSHA has prepared the regulatory impact analysis in two phases. Phase Iinvolved the use of a number of secondary data bases to collect informationon the chemicals to be regulated and the industries in which they are used.These data bases provided information on the toxicity and health effectsof exposure to the chemicals, and current information on engineering controlsin use and emergency response procedures. Two data bases provided informationon employee exposures. The 1982 National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES)was based on a sample of about 4,500 businesses. The data base developedfrom this survey contains an estimate of the number of persons occupationallyexposed to hazardous substances by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC).The second data base was OSHA's Integrated Management Information System(IMIS). The IMIS contains the results of air samples taken since 1979 byOSHA industrial hygienists in the course of compliance inspections. Boththe NOES and IMIS data bases provided valuable information on the natureand extent of employee exposures to the substances to be regulated; however,they did not provide complete information on all substances. Supplementaryinformation was obtained from industrial hygienists and engineers. Theseexperts identified exposure controls in use and the number and size ofplants most likely to be affected by this rulemaking. These sources haveprovided OSHA with a substantial body of information on chemical use, exposuresand controls.Phase II of the data collection effort involved a sampling survey of about5,700 firms in industries where chemical exposures were believed to posepotential problems. The survey, conducted during the first part of 1988,gathered data on chemicals, processes, exposures and controls currentlyin use. These additional data have permitted OSHA to refine the Phase Ipreliminary estimates of technical and economic feasibility. In addition,site visits to 90 firms were conducted to verify the data collected onchemicals, processes, controls, and employee exposures.OSHA has used contractors to assist in these data collection efforts. Threecontractors have supplied expert knowledge on the industries affected andthe engineering controls needed to reach the proposed exposure levels.These contractors are Kearney/Centaur Division of A.T. Kearney, MeridianResearch, and CONSAD. Fu Associates provided data base management supportduring all phases of the project. Washington Consulting Group designedthe sample for the surveyed firms and KCA Research conducted the telephoneinterviews of these firms.<ITAG tagnum="81">Employee Exposure and Benefits</ITAG>Revising OSHA's Z-Table limits for hazardous substances is expected toresult in reduced risk of chemically-related disease among exposed employees.Exposure to substances included in the rulemaking has been associated witha variety of adverse health effects, including impairment of organ systemfunctions, mucous membrane irritation, neuropathy, narcosis, allergic sensitization,respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.Using data from OSHA's IMIS system and information collected from the surveyof about 5,700 establishments, OSHA estimates that over 21 million employeesare potentially exposed to hazardous substances in the workplace. OSHAalso estimates that over four and one-half million employees are currentlyexposed above the proposed exposure limits for these substances. TableB-1 summarizes OSHA's estimates of the number of workers currently at riskof adverse health effects. OSHA estimates that promulgation of the finalrule's exposure limits will result in a potential reduction of over 55,000work-related illness cases per year, over 23,000 lost-workday illness casesper year, and almost 520,000 lost workdays due to illness per year. OSHA'sestimate is that industry compliance with the final rule's exposure limitswill result in a reduction of an average of 683 fatalities annually thatare caused by exposure to substances that cause cancer, respiratory disease,cardiovascular disease, or liver or kidney disease.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) O 1503</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Nonregulatory Alternatives</ITAG>OSHA believes that there are no nonregulatory alternatives that adequatelyprotect most workers from the adverse health effects associated with exposureto the chemicals under consideration. OSHA believes that the tort liabilitylaws and Workers' Compensation do not provide adequate worker protectiondue to market imperfections. Some employers have not complied with thestandards recommended by professional organizations. The deleterious healtheffects resulting from continued high levels of exposure to hazardous substancesrequire a regulatory solution, and the OSH Act requires the Agency to protectworkers' health.<ITAG tagnum="81">Technological Feasibility</ITAG>Consistent with OSHA regulations and policy, engineering controls and workpractices are preferred over personal protective equipment to control employeeexposures to airborne contaminants.Engineering controls involve the use of a local exhaust ventilation, generalventilation, isolation of the worker and enclosure of the source of emissions,process modifications, equipment modifications, and substitution of non-hazardousor less hazardous chemicals. These methods may be used alone or in combination,depending upon the industrial processes involved. These controls are widelyused and will effectively control exposures either by themselves, or coupledwith changes in work practices.Perhaps the most widely used technique for controlling chemical exposureis the use of ventilation. General ventilation uses the movement of airwithin the general work space to displace or dilute the contaminant withfresh outside air. General ventilation may not be the preferred controlmethod, however, due to the large volumes of air movement required. Localexhaust ventilation uses much smaller volume of air and controls emissionsat the point or source from which contaminants are generated.Isolation involves placing a physical barrier between the hazardous operationand the worker. Many modern, automated manufacturing processes are nowfully enclosed in ventilated cabinets. The effectiveness of such a controltechnique depends on the frequency with which the workers have to enterthe enclosure during normal operations. In other situations, the worker,rather than the process or machine, can be placed in an enclosure havinga controlled atmosphere. Many processes which involve potential chemicalexposures are operated remotely by operators from air-conditioned boothsisolated from the hazardous materials.Substitution refers to the replacement of a toxic chemical in a particularprocess or work area with another, less toxic or non-toxic product. Properlyapplied, substitution can be a very effective control technique. However,care must be taken to ensure that the proposed substitute performs in asimilar manner to the product being replaced. In addition, it is essentialthat the substitute be carefully evaluated to ensure that in controllingone hazard, another different hazard is not inadvertently introduced. Thesubstitute must also be compatible with existing manufacturing equipmentand processes.The success of these engineering control techniques will depend on thephysical properties of the chemicals and emissions encountered (boilingpoint, vapor pressure, etc.) and the process operating conditions. In somecases, particularly with cleaning solvents, substitution may provide thequickest and most effective means of reducing exposure. In other situations,a major effort may be required to alter processes or install or expandlocal or general dilution ventilation.OSHA has found that engineering controls and improved work practices areavailable to reduce exposure levels to the new levels in almost all circumstances.Standard controls have been adapted in numerous situations to solve situation-specificproblems in all of the industry sectors affected. Detailed industry-specificillustrations of this point are presented in the Technological FeasibilityChapter of this Feasibility and Regulatory Analysis. OSHA does recognize,however, that in some circumstances, respiratory protection may be necessaryto complement engineering controls and that respiratory protection mayalso be necessary to achieve compliance in some specific operations insome industries.<ITAG tagnum="81">Costs of Compliance </ITAG>Costs of compliance with the proposed rulemaking would result from industryactions to lower workers' chemical exposures to the levels promulgatedin the final rule. The 1988 sample survey of almost 5,700 firms was drawnfrom a universe of over one million firms potentially affected by the rule.Table B-5 at the end of this section presents a list of industries includedin the analysis. Survey respondents verified the number of work stations and workers relatedto each process, the process location and configuration, the controls alreadyin place, and potential chemical exposures above new proposed levels. Processcontrols in place were compared to a list of control designs needed tolimit exposures to the new, lower levels. Where the required controls werenot reported to be in place, a compliance cost per work station was assigned.Process control costs were summed per establishment and certain maintenanceworkers were assigned a respirator cost. Costs for the surveyed establishmentswere then weighted (by SIC and size) to represent compliance costs forthe universe of affected plants. The survey found that over 500,000 establishments (of the 1,101,600 establishmentscovered by the survey) reported using the chemicals being regulated. Ofthis number, 131,005 would incur some costs to comply with the new limits.The total estimated annualized capital plus annual operating costs are$787.98 million. Table B-2 presents the annual cost by industry sectorand the average per plant annual cost for large and small (fewer than 20employees) plants.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 0 _ 1507</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>Among all industry sectors the average annual cost per affected establishmentwill be $6,000.<ITAG tagnum="81">Economic Impact</ITAG>OSHA prepared two estimates of the economic effects of this regulationon potentially affected firms. The two estimates were based upon No Cost-Passthrough(``worst case'') and Total Cost-Passthrough (``best case'') scenarios.In the first scenario it was assumed that all compliance costs would beabsorbed by firms in the form of reduced profits. Table B-3 contains asummary of this ``worst case'' analysis. Under this scenario, the estimatedaverage percent reduction in profits for all affected firms was less thanone percent. The estimated reduction in profit of 2.3 percent for SIC 30Rubber and Plastics was the highest among all industries. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 0 _ 1509</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>In the second scenario it was assumed that all compliance costs would bepassed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. The potential priceincrease for an industry sector at the two-digit SIC level was estimatedby dividing the sector's compliance cost by its total sales. In this scenario,there would be little impact on market prices; none of the estimated priceincreases exceeded one-half of one percent (see Table B-4).<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 0 _ 1510</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>Based on this analysis, OSHA concludes that the final standard is economicallyfeasible for each sector. The impact on prices is slight and, even in theworst cases, the reductions in profitability are small.<ITAG tagnum="81">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-353, 94 Stat.1664) [5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], OSHA has made a preliminary assessment ofhow this rulemaking will affect large and small establishments. The resultsof this preliminary assessment indicate that some small establishmentsmay experience some adverse impact. The smaller profit margins of somesmall establishments may make it difficult for them to absorb increasesin compliance costs. An important ameliorating factor for each affectedfirm will be its ability to pass through additional costs to the consumer.The ability of individual firms to do this will be dependent upon productdemand elasticities. It is expected that all impacted firms will be ableto pass through some portion of their increased costs.<ITAG tagnum="81">Environmental Impact</ITAG>The standard has been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of theNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the Council on EnvironmentalQuality NEPA regulations, and the Department of Labor's NEPA complianceprocedures and is not anticipated to have significant impact on the externalenvironment.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) ) _ 1512 _ 1513</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">C. Survey of Affected Industries</ITAG>Chemicals and other hazardous substances are present to some degree inall industries. However, some industry sectors use chemicals more extensivelythan others and have controls in place which do not always reduce workers'exposures below permissible exposure levels. This chapter presents an overviewof those industries which OSHA believes may experience costs and benefitsas a result of this rulemaking. In order to estimate and quantify the potentialimpact of the rule, a sample survey of about 5,700 establishments was conductedduring the first part of 1988. The results of the survey provided the basisfor the cost and benefit estimates presented in this Feasibility and RegulatoryAnalyses.Table C-1 at the end of this chapter shows establishment and employmentdata for the industries where OSHA expects costs and benefits. In orderto determine which industries to include in the sample survey, OSHA reliedprimarily on two data sources: 1) the NIOSH National Occupational ExposureSurvey (NOES) of 1982 and supplementary information from the NIOSH 1972survey; and 2) data in the OSHA Integrated Management Information System(IMIS). The 1982 NOES data base contains a sample of the number of personsexposed by substance and industry from almost 4,500 businesses in 98 differentgeographic areas in the United States. OSHA's IMIS contains the resultsof exposure samples taken since 1979 by industrial hygienists during thecourse of compliance inspections. Using these two data bases, industrieswhich are likely to use the substances in this rulemaking at levels whichmight exceed the proposed exposure limits were identified.As a check on this list of industries, OSHA contracted with about one dozenindustrial hygienists and chemical engineers to review the list. Basedon their professional knowledge, these experts verified the industrieswith potential exposure problems. The final list of industries selectedfor the sample survey included over 30 two-, three-, and four-digit SICswhere it is believed that chemical exposures potentially exceed the newor revised levels.Industry sectors not included in the survey are those where OSHA believesthere is little potential chemical exposure or where existing exposuresare well controlled. Industries which were not surveyed for these reasonsincluded finance, real estate, insurance and most service and retail tradesectors. The construction industry was also excluded and will be the subjectof a separate rulemaking action. Industries such as mining and certaintransportation sectors were not included since other agencies have safetyand health enforcement jurisdiction. Certain industry sectors includingtextile, apparel, food and tobacco products are expected to incur somecosts as a result of this rulemaking, but these were not included in thesample survey. The reasons for not including these sectors in the surveywere restraints on the sample size, relatively low hazardous substanceexposure levels, and the availability of adequate information on the engineeringcontrols currently in use in these industries.Industrial hygienists and engineers under contract to OSHA also identifiedthe processes used in the industries surveyed, and the chemicals used inthose processes. Expected levels of exposure and the number of employeespotentially exposed were estimated. The list of processes and chemicalsdetermined to be in common use in each industry sector was subsequentlyverified in the sample survey.Establishments to be surveyed were selected based on a statistical sampleof all establishments in the surveyed industry sectors. For each SIC, establishmentswere selected from four size categories.<ITAG tagnum="14">(a) 0-19 employees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(b) 20-99 employees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(c) 100-249 employees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(d) 250 or more employees</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This permitted analysis of the effects of the rulemaking by establishmentemployment size.About 5,000 completed responses were required to obtain statistically validresults. The field survey was conducted by KCA Research using Computer-AssistedTelephone Interviewing (CATI). Trained interviewers requested data fromeach establishment regarding production employment, chemical usage, andexposure guidelines in use. Respondents were asked to verify the presenceor absence of chemicals and processes believed to be found in establishmentsin their industry, and were asked to volunteer information on other chemicalsnot included on the interviewers' ``prompt'' list of chemicals in use.For each chemical present, the respondent was asked about amounts used,employee exposure levels, and processes where used. For each process, therespondent was asked questions concerning its configuration, frequencyof use, and the types of controls and personal protective equipment inuse. This information was used to develop the estimates of costs and benefitspresented in this RIA.Supplement 1 contains a technical summary of the survey and Supplement4 contains tabulations of the survey results. (Survey results include someresponses from SIC 44_Water Transportation and SIC 46_Pipelines. Thesewere included prior to a determination that the SICs included industriesnot within the scope of this rulemaking, or where other agencies have jurisdiction.)The results generally corroborated the preliminary assessments of potentialindustry exposures and overexposure to chemicals and provided a generalpicture of workers' exposure in these industries. In the sample of about5,700 firms, over one-half reported chemicals being used in the workplace.Most of the firms which reported no chemical usage were small administrativeor distribution units of multi-plant companies. Among the firms surveyedwhich use chemicals, almost one-third use specific exposure standards astargets for maintaining workers' exposure. The OSHA PELs are used by 59percent of firms with specific exposure standards, ACGIH TLVs are usedby 22 percent and the NIOSH RELs by one percent. Table C-2 shows the distributionof adopted exposure standards by surveyed industry groups. Over one-thirdof all firms reported that they have a hazard communication training program;however, less than one-half of the firms using chemicals reported havinga hazard communication program (see Table C-3).<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 1518-1519</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>Some commenters objected to the use of the telephone survey method in lieuof written responses [see, for example, Exs. 3-750, 3-877 and 3-747]. Theystated that the questions were too diverse and complex to be answered bya single person, and that the use of the CATI techniques necessitated simplifiedresponses to questions. As preparation for the survey, OSHA sent a letter to each potential respondentapproximately two weeks in advance of the initial phone contact. The letterdescribed the nature of the project, the topics to be covered by the surveyand a response card to be returned to the survey contractor listing thename of the person best able to answer the questions. When requested, acopy of the survey questionnaire was provided. With this advance preparation,OSHA believes that respondents were able to accurately and completely answerthe questions. While all firms were encouraged to complete the survey overthe telephone so that the responses could be entered on the computer duringthe interview, some firms refused to do so and also failed to return thewritten survey forms. Overall, the survey achieved a 60 percent completionratio (the ratio of completed questionnaires to total sample cases drawn,both in and out of scope). OSHA believes that the use of the CATI techniquegreatly improved the response rate to the survey. Previous OSHA surveyshave had completion ratios as low as 30 percent. To reduce the burden on respondents, process and chemical lists were usedto prompt respondents. Two commenters [Ex. 3-625, Ex. 3-750] stated thatthe lists were incomplete and thereby biased the final data. However, oneof these [Ex. 3-750) correctly stated that ``. . . responders were alsoasked to volunteer additional processes or chemicals present in their plants.''Since respondents did indeed volunteer ``Other'' chemicals, OSHA believesthat the use of the prompt ``Other'' improved the final data instead ofbiasing it. The Inter-Industry Wood Dust Coordinating Committee commentedthat the survey did not include wood dust and processes specifically relatedto wood dust exposure, as prompts [Ex. 3-750]. However, respondents replied,in many instances, that there was exposure to ``nuisance particulates''.OSHA used these responses as surrogates for responses on wood dust. However,the Agency concluded that the costs in the Preliminary Regulatory ImpactAnalysis understated ``the extent of new controls that would be neededin order to comply with the proposed wood dust standard'' [Ex. 38A]. InSICs 24 and 25, the number of work stations where wood dust is found, thepercent of work stations which would be out of compliance with the proposedlevels, and unit costs for controlling exposure were revised to supplementthe survey results, and the recalculated costs of compliance were providedto interested parties and entered into the docket [Ex. 38A]. Commenters also objected to the inclusion of non-production facilitiesin the survey [Ex. 3-1196, Ex. 3-877, Tr. 8/15/88, p. 105]. The samplesurvey was designed to represent the universe of facilities in each SIC.There are always a certain number of facilities in each SIC which are headquarters,distribution centers, or sales offices. Where workers at these facilitieshave no exposure to chemicals, there is no cost to control exposure andno benefits to accrue from lowered exposure levels. Inclusion of thesefacilities is statistically correct in order to represent that portionof the facilities in an SIC which would incur no cost. The survey sample was statistically designed to include a higher proportionof larger establishments (20 or more employees) because of the wider variationin costs expected for large firms to comply. The American Mining Congress[Ex. 3-976] expressed concern about ``the underrepresentation of smallcompanies'' in SICs 32 and 33, while the American Iron and Steel Institute[Ex. 3-1123] commented that average costs for large firms are not representativeof costs for large steel facilities in SIC 33. OSHA believes that the genericnature of this rulemaking allows a greater latitude in grouping industriesin order to estimate ``average'' costs, and that the higher proportionof large firms surveyed has provided a more valid estimate of the averagecosts. Small firms were not underrepresented. Rather, firms in the largesize classes were ``oversampled'' using accepted statistical techniques.Based on the survey, OSHA estimates that over 60 percent of productionworkers in most of the industries surveyed are potentially exposed to chemicalsand about 10-15 percent of these would be overexposed at the levels proposedin this rulemaking. Chapter D presents OSHA's estimates of the benefitsoccurring from a reduction in the number of employees exposed to thesechemicals. The industry profiles that follow present economic information on industrysectors expected to be affected by the rulemaking. Most but not all ofthese industries were included in the samply survey. Table C-1, presentedat the end of the chapter, contains employment and establishment data foreach industry profiled. The number of establishments in that table wasproduced from 1985 Dun and Bradstreet data, to be consistent with the employmentand economic impact data used in this chapter and in Chapter H. Table C-4 shows the number of establishments estimated from the 1988 samplesurvey as compared to the number in the 1986-87 Dun and Bradstreet (D andamp;B) file from which the sample was selected. In general, the estimated numberof establishments from the survey is lower than the number in the originalD andamp; B file. Survey telephone contracts found that some sampled firmswere either out of business, out of the scope of the survey (wrong SIC),or listed more than once on the file.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 1524</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>It is possible to compare these survey establishment counts by comparingthem to two alternative governmental sources: 1985 County Business Patternsfrom the U.S. Department of Commerce and 1987 ES-202 data from the Bureauof Labor Statistics (BLS), U.S. Department of Labor. Table C-4 also providesthese governmental establishment counts.   In general, these two databases showed fewer establishments than eitherthe survey or the D andamp; B file. Some of these differences are due tothe way an ``establishment'' is defined. D andamp; B may split one establishmentat a particular address into several establishments based on the variousactivities performed there; ES-202 and County Business Patterns may categorizethe same establishment as one unit. Also, many state and federally-runestablishments are included in the D andamp; B file in the SIC related totheir primary activity, rather than as governmental units, which wouldbe the ES-202 and County Business Pattern classification.  There is no concensus among experts as to which source provides the mostaccurate establishment counts. Based on this comparison and other qualitychecks, OSHA believes that the survey has provided a sound basis for estimatingthe economic impact of this rulemaking.SIC 20_Food and Kindred Products  This major industry group includes establishments that manufacture or processfood and beverages for human consumption as well as certain related productssuch as ice, chewing gum, vegetable and animal fats and oils, and preparedanimal feeds [1, pp. 59 to 69]. This industry group was not included inthe sample survey. Rather, industry data, costs and economic impact wereestimated by experts familiar with this industry sector.  Employment and establishment data are shown in Table C-1. The total 1985value of SIC 20 shipments ($301.6 billion) was 13 percent of the valueof all manufacturing industry shipments; this represented the largest shareof any two-digit manufacturing industry. The most important industry withinSIC 20 is meat products, accounting for 22 percent of the value of shipments,followed by beverages and dairy products, accounting for 14 percent each[2, Vol 1:8].  In 1985, 1.6 million workers in over 29,000 establishments were employedin SIC 20. About 70 percent of these are production workers [Table C-1].Employment has declined since 1979. The largest employer is the meat productsindustry, with 23 percent of the workforce in 1986, followed by preservedfruits and vegetables (15 percent) and beverages (13 percent). Meat andmiscellaneous food products both experienced 1986 employment levels slightlyabove the 1979 peak [5]. The largest number of food products establishmentsare in the manufacturing or processing of miscellaneous foods and meatproducts (17 percent and 16 percent, respectively).  Establishments in SIC 20 are similar in size to those in the manufacturingindustry as a whole, although there is a smaller concentration of verylarge establishments. Mean establishment size is 55 workers.  Most recent growth by large food processors has been through business acquisitionsrather than internal expansion. The food and beverage sector is becomingmore concentrated and efficient. In most food industries for which dataare available, concentration is moderate, with the largest four firms havinga 30 percent share of sales. Exceptions can be found in cereal breakfastfoods, where the four-firm concentration ratio is just over 75 percent,and in soft drinks, where it is 88 percent [3, pp. 33-1 to 39-39].  In the next few years, most food and beverage producers will benefit fromincreases in disposable income, favorable trends in consumer purchasingpatterns, and continued low commodity prices. Decreased operating costsand expenses have resulted in a 6 percent increase in (revenue) incomein 1985-86 for large food and beverage processors, despite sales gainsof only a little more than 1 percent [3, p. 39-1].  In 1985, the median rate of return on assets in the food and kindred productsindustry was 5.1 percent; this was the third lowest for the 20 two-digitmanufacturing industry group. The highest rates of return were registeredby the cookie and cracker industry and the blended and prepared flour industry(11.8 percent and 11.1 percent, respectively), followed by the flavoringextracts industry (9.2 percent). At the other extreme, the wine and brandyindustry registered a ^0.9 percent rate of return on assets in 1985, withan average rate of under 0.1 percent for the 1984-86 period. The cheeseand rice milling industries also have relatively low rates or return onassets (2.2 percent) [6].  OSHA received docket comments pertaining to several four-digit SICs (2011,2013, 2016, 2017, and 2074) falling within the Food and Kindred Productsindustrial classification. Most comments addressed the use of three substancesincluded in this rulemaking_carbon disulfide, ammonia, and chlorine_inthe meat products sector (SIC 2013).  Commenters noted that firms in SIC 2013 produce hot dogs, luncheon meats,and boneless hams; production of these processed meats uses 3.6 billionpounds of meat and 0.9 billion pounds of poultry annually. Ten percentof all meat production goes into the production of processed meats; forsome meats, the share is larger: 83 percent of all ham is processed intoboneless hams [Exs. 3-421, 3-898]. Most of the meat used in processed meatis trimmings, which are not suitable for use in other meats. An estimated65 percent of all processed meats are dependent on cellulosic materialsfor their manufacture [Ex. 3-421]. The production of casings of this typeinvolves the use of carbon disulfide, and, according to commenters, achievingthe proposed limit of 1 ppm for this substance would have created issuesof technological and economic feasibility (discussed in greater detailin the Technological Feasibility chapter, below). In the final rule, thelimits for carbon disulfide are 4 ppm as an 8-hour TWA and 12 ppm as aSTEL; these limits should ameliorate any feasibility problems. In addition,the final rule has increased PEL and STEL limits for both ammonia (35 ppmSTEL only) and chlorine (0.5 ppm TWA, 1.0 ppm STEL) which should furtherreduce the economic impact on this industry sector.  OSHA received many comments addressing the proposed 4-mg/m3 TWA limit forgrain dust (wheat, oats, and barley) in facilities classified in SIC 204,Grain Mill Products [Exs. 3-63, 3-110, 3-237, 3-299, 3-405, 3-752, and3-755]. Comments were received from the owners of flour mills, rice mills,and feed mills. The National Feed and Grain Association (NFGA) [Ex. 3-752]estimated that the number of feed mills that use wheat, oats, or barleyto produce feed is 1,260 facilities, or about 14 percent of all feed mills.The NFGA arrived at this estimate by assuming that feed mills use oats,wheat, and barley in proportion to the total U.S. usage of these grainsas compared with the usage of other feed grains [Ex. 3-752]. (Estimatesof the number of feed mills is difficult because feed mills are often classifiedin other industrial classifications if the major portion of their salesis generated by non-feed-mill activities, such as grain elevator operationsor sales of farm supplies.) The NFGA characterized its estimate of 1,260potentially affected feed mills as ``conservative'' [Ex. 3-752]. Commentersto the record from the Grain Mill Products segment of SIC 20 stated unanimouslythat achievement of the proposed 4 mg/m3 limit for grain dust was not feasiblein affected grain mills [Exs. 3-63, 3-110, 3-237, 3-299, 3-405, 3-752,and 3-755]. This issue is discussed further in the Technological Feasibilitychapter. Because OSHA has revised the PEL for grain dust to 10 mg/m3 inthe final rule, most of the problems with technological feasibility raisedby these commenters are likely to have been mitigated.  A comment to the record [Ex. 3-1080] from the National Cotton Council ofAmerica (NCCA) stated that cottonseed oil mills (SIC 2074) will be adverselyimpacted by the proposed rule. These mills process cottonseed and its variouscomponents for use in animal feed, edible oil, and cellulose products;their concerns are with the proposed limits for n-hexane and hexane insomers,vegetable oil mist, and grain dust. According to the NCCA, there are 50operating cottonseed mills in the United States, and most of these aresmall, rural businesses without in-house industrial hygiene capabilitiy.The NCCA anticipates that its members will have difficulty measuring theproposed levels for these substances [Ex. 3-1080, p. 1]. The NCCA's commentsare discussed in greater detail in Chapter F, Technological Feasibility.SIC 21_Tobacco Manufactures  Establishments in the tobacco manufactures industry produce cigarettes(SIC 211), cigars (SIC 212), chewing and smoking tobacco, and snuff (SIC213), or they engage in tobacco stemming and redrying (SIC 214) [1, p.70]. The major worker exposures in these industries are to particulatesnot otherwise regulated during the initial handling of tobacco and to chemicalsthat have been used to treat the tobacco. This industry was not includedin the sample survey.Data on employment and establishments for SIC 21 are shown in Table C-1.In 1985, the value of tobacco manufacturing shipments was $18.5 billion,slightly more than 6 percent of the value of shipments for all manufacturing[2, Vol. 1:8]. SIC 21 has less than 0.3 percent of the total employmentor establishments in manufacturing [7, pp. 10, 15]. Three-quarters of theemployees in this industry are production workers. The cigarette industryis the most important component of SIC 21, accounting for more than 80percent of the value of shipments [2, Vol. 1:8] and 70 pecent of employmentfor this sector, but only 9 percent of establishments [7, p. 15].Establishments in SIC 21 are large, with a mean size of 296 employees,compared to 55 for all manufacturing. More than half of the establishmentsin this two-digit SIC have fewer than 20 employees [Table C-1]; and morethan 17 percent have 250 or more employees. The cigarette industry is especiallyhighly concentrated, with a mean establishment size of 2,430 employees.Eleven establishments in the cigarette industry employ 1,000 or more workers,and 99.8 percent of all cigarette manufacturing employees work in theselarge establishments. Mean establishment sizes in other tobacco industriesrange from 80 to 135 employees [7, pp. 10, 15]. Employment in the tobaccoproducts industry has declined every year since 1976 (except in 1981),with a total decline in employment of more than 23 percent over the lastdecade [5].Most tobacco firms remain profitable because input costs have been relativelystable and prices have increased faster than consumption has declined.The major tobacco companies are continuing to reduce their vulnerabilitythrough mergers and diversification [3, pp. 40-1 to 40-7]. Thus, profitabilityin the tobacco manufactures industry is good. The 1985 median rate of returnon assets (7.7 percent) was the fifth highest median rate of return onassets among firms in the 20 manufacturing industry groups [6].OSHA received no comments or testimony on the tobacco manufacturing sectorin the course of this rulemaking.SIC 22_Textile Mill ProductsSIC 22 includes those establishments that perform any of the followingsix operations: (1) Preparation of fiber and subsequent manufacturing ofyarn, thread, braids, twine and cordage; (2) manufacturing broadwoven fabrics,narrow woven fabrics, knit fabrics, and carpets and rugs from yarn; (3)dyeing and finishing fiber, yarn, fabrics and knit apparel; (4) coating,waterproofing, or otherwise treating fabrics; (5) the integrated manufacturingof knit apparel and other finished articles from yarn; and (6) the manufactureof felt goods, lace goods, nonwoven fabrics, and miscellaneous textiles[1, p. 85].According to the Department of Commerce, in 1986, shipments for the textileindustry increased 4 percent. The value of shipments in 1985 ($53.3 billion)has increased 6 percent since 1981. Employment, however, remained on along-term downward trend, although the 1986 drop was marginal. An upwardtrend in output and relatively high operating rates helped to keep thedrop in employment to a minimum. Also, average hours worked, which increasedin the second half of 1985, continued to rise in 1986 [3, p. 41-1].Table C-1 presents data on the number of establishments and employmentin SIC 22. Similar to other manufacturing industries, the mean establishmentsize in SIC 22 was 64 employees. Between 1981 and 1985, SIC 22 experienceda 15 percent decrease in employment. In 1985, almost 86 percent of thetotal number of employees were production workers [5]. The median rateof return on assets in the textile mill products industry was 5.6 percentin 1985 [6].No commenters provided additional information on this industry, and itwas not included in the 1988 sample survey.SIC 23_Apparel and Other ProductsSIC 23 is referred to as the ``cutting-up and needle trades,'' and includesestablishments producing clothing and fabricating products by cutting andsewing purchased woven or knot textile fabrics and related materials. Thesematerials may include leather, rubberized fabrics, plastics, and furs.In addition, establishments that manufacture clothing by cutting and joiningmaterials are included [1, p. 97].SIC 23 includes three types of apparel establishments: (1) The regularor inside factories, which perform the usual manufacturing functions withintheir own plant; (2) contract factories, which manufacture apparel frommaterials owned by others; and (3) apparel jobbers, which buy raw materials,design and prepare samples, arrange for the manufacture of clothing fromtheir materials, and sell the finished product [1, p. 97]. According toU.S. Department of Commerce estimates, the 1987 value of shipments forSIC 23 experienced a growth rate of 5 percent over 1986 values [4, p. 45-1].Between 1980 and 1985, SIC 23 was among the top ten SICs to experiencethe greatest employment decline. Due to large inventories at both retailand wholesale levels, and low consumer demand, there were decreases inboth shipments and employment in 1985. In several geographic areas, plantswere forced to close. The drop in employment has been attributed to therecent rise of imports into the U.S. market and to improvements in industryefficiency through streamlined operations and increased productivity [3,p. 42-2].The apparel industry is a major employer of women and minorities, employingmore than 6 percent of the manufacturing workforce in plants. Due to intensecompetition in the industry, profits and wages are lower in this industrythan in most other manufacturing industries. The price of labor is thesingle most important cost component in the industry, which accounts forthe sensitivity that employment levels have to industry growth levels.Production workers make up 85 percent of the apparel work force. Typically,as inventory levels grow, production slows down and employment drops [3,p. 42-2].In 1986, current-dollar shipments in the apparel industry expanded in valueby 3 percent. An increase in consumer demand was the major factor contributingto the upturn. Output levels began to regain former levels of output, andthe falling rate of employment of about 1 percent was well below the 3.1percent annual rate of decline during the 1980-1986 period [3. p. 42-2].Table C-1 presents employment and establishment data for SIC 23 for 1985.During the period of 1981 through 1985, SIC 23 experienced a 10 percentdecrease in employment. Almost 84 percent of the total number of employeeswere production workers [5]. In 1985, the median rate of return on assetsin this SIC was 6.3 percent [6]. This sector was not included in the samplesurvey. Beginning with SIC 24_Lumber and Wood Products, all the remainingmajor manufacturing SIC groups were included in the 1988 survey unlessotherwise noted in the text.SIC 24_Lumber and Wood ProductsThis industry produces logs, pickets and fences, mining timbers, railroadties, poles and pulpwood. SIC 24 includes establishments that cut timberand pulpwood, merchant sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, cooperage stockmills, planing mills, and plywood mills and veneer mills engaged in producinglumber and wood basic materials; and establishments that manufacture finishedarticles made entirely or mainly of wood or related materials [1, p. 107].According to U.S. Department of Commerce estimates, the logging industry'stimber harvest in 1987 was an estimated $9.1 billion, compared with $8.8billion in 1986. [4, p. 5-2].The Department of Commerce reports that a strong expansion of the marketfor wood products took place in 1985 due to gains in housing and nonresidentialconstruction activities. Although domestic demand for softwood lumber wasstrong, Canadian imports displaced American products and contributed toan oversupply, depressing prices. These lower prices lowered U.S. lumberproducer profit margins and induced industrywide efforts to restrict importsof lower priced Canadian softwood lumber. In addition to the oversupply,accelerated harvesting to avoid pest damage forced inventories to go upand prices to fall further [3, p. 4-1].In 1986, similar trends continued in the domestic market for wood products.This was due to a 6 percent rise in housing starts, continued growth inhome remodeling and renovation, and strong demand from furniture marketsand other end users. However, lower-priced softwood lumber imports fromCanada continued to squeeze profits in 1986 [3, p. 4-1]. The Canadian softwood lumber prices brought about a trade agreement onDecember 30, 1986 between the United States and Canada, in which Canadaagreed to set a 15 percent export tax on its softwood lumber. Canadiansoftwood lumber prices in the United States have risen 3 to 4 percent andimports have decreased about 3 to 4 percent. Since the agreement, Canada'smarket share has dropped from 33 percent to 28 percent. U.S. company earningshave increased despite a drop in housing starts. It is expected that thetrade agreement will keep Canadian softwood prices up and continue to aidthe domestic softwood lumber market [8]. Table C-1 presents employment and establishment data for SIC 24 for 1985,as well as for the three individual three-digit industry groups which weresurveyed. In 1985, the mean establishment size in SIC 24 was 19 employees,significantly smaller than the average size in other manufacturing sectors.The median rate of return on assets in the SIC was 7.3 percent [6]. The National Kitchen Cabinet Association stated that the Dun and Bradstreetsampling frame used for the survey seriously underestimated the numberof establishments [Ex. 80L]. Dun and Bradstreet estimated the number ofestablishments in SIC 24 as 36,710 [6]. The Department of Commerce in the1985 County Business Patterns estimated the number to be 32,205 [7]. Inmaking cost estimates for the Inter-Industry Wood Dust Coordinating Committee,National Economic Research Associates (NERA) assumed that there were only26,485 establishments (using the 1982 Census of Manufacturers) [Ex. 3-748].Thus, OSHA believes that the Dun and Bradstreet data used for the surveydo not underestimate the total number of establishments. Additionally, OSHA does not differ significantly from NERA on the totalnumber of employees in SIC 24. OSHA used the Labstat Database of the U.S.Department of Labor to conclude that 697,000 persons were employed in 1985[5]. NERA estimated that the industry employed 691,656 workers in 1986.Thus it appears that NERA accepts OSHA's estimate relating to the numberof employees. SIC 242_Sawmills and Planing Mills This SIC includes sawmills and planing mills, hardwood dimension and flooringmills, and special product sawmills. The U.S. Department of Commerce reportedthat in 1985, SIC 242 employed 26 percent of all employees and represented21 percent of all establishments in SIC 24 [7]. The value of shipmentsfrom 1981 to 1985 rose 10 percent in SIC 2421 and 45 percent in SIC 2426[4]. The Department of Commerce also reported that employment declined14 percent in sawmills and rose 3 percent in hardwood dimension and flooringover the same time period. Production workers represent 87 percent of allemployees in this industry. Special product sawmills (SIC 249) includefacilities that produce shakes and shingles; approximately 290 firms useWestern red cedar [9]. Firms in this sector were not included in the 1988 sample survey. OSHArelied on Dun and Bradstreet data to estimate the number of establishmentsin SIC 242. The National Dimension Manufacturers Association quoted the1982 Census of Manufactures by stating that 789 establishments were inSIC 2426, of which 306 had 20 or more employees [Ex. 3-1160]. The Departmentof Commerce stated that there were 714 establishments in 1984, of which320 had 20 or more employees [7]. Similarly the Census of Manufacturesestimated the employment at 29,100 workers in 1987, while County BusinessPatterns estimated 26,841 in 1984. The difference in these estimates appearsto be minor and largely associated with the difference in time and methodsof data collection. SIC 243_Millwork, Veneer and Plywood This SIC includes establishments that manufacture fabricated wood millwork,covered with materials such as metal and plastics. According to the U.S.Department of Commerce, the value of shipments for SIC 243 was $16.7 billionin 1985, which represents 31 percent of the value of shipments for SIC24 [3]. The value of shipments in SIC 243 increased 27 percent since 1981.In 1985, the number of employees in SIC 243 was about 37 percent of SIC24. The number of employees in SIC 243 increased by 18 percent from 1981to 1985 [5]. Average hourly earnings dropped about 17 percent during thatsame time period. The number of establishments in SIC 243 in 1985 was about38 percent of all establishments in SIC 24 [5]. In SIC 243, the 1988 survey identified more than twice as many small firms(fewer than 20 production workers) as large firms. In the small firms,maintenance work is performed for the most part by production workers.By contrast, in large firms, maintenance work is predominantly performedby dedicated maintenance workers. The manufacturers classified in SIC 243 usually have one to three basicprocesses, with potential exposure to one to three substances. Thirty-ninepercent of these processes involve exposure to chemicals or substanceson an intermittent short-term basis (up to 30 minutes) with large firmstending to have more long-term exposures. Twenty-nine percent of the firmsin this SIC reported the adoption of internal exposure standards. Of thosesmall firms with internal exposure standards, most have adopted OSHA PELs.Nearly 71 percent of the large firms with standards reported using theOSHA PELS; the balance indicated that they rely on ACGIH TLVs or otherstandards. Employee monitoring had been performed at 17 percent of theprocesses. The survey found that about 29 percent of the processes in SIC 243 aretotally enclosed and 8 percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilationis used most frequently to control exposures at processes not enclosed.Nearly 72 percent of the firms with chemical exposures have respiratorsfor employee use, with a higher percentage of small firms reporting thepresence of respirators than large firms. The combined data on exposurelevels and methods of exposure control indicate that many plants whichare estimated to incur some cost of compliance have overexposures in allprocesses at that plant. Survey respondents in SIC 243 identified the presence of 35 different substancesin SIC 243. Particulates not otherwise regulated were estimated to occurmost frequently at a total of 8,956 processes. Particulates not otherwiseregulated were identified in bleaching, coating/spraying/finishing/layup,cutting/sawing/planing, drying/baking, gluing/hot pressing, sanding/polishing/grinding,and metal working (rolling, milling, shaping). The final rule does notchange the existing limit on these particulates. Wood dust exposures occurin cutting/sawing/planing and sanding/polishing/grinding. SIC 244_Wood ContainersThis SIC represents manufacturers of wood containers, including wood palletsand skids. The pallet industry is the third largest consumer of lumberin the United States, after the construction and furniture industries [Ex.3-1125]. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, more than 70 percentof the establishments in SIC 244 employ 20 or fewer people [7]. SIC 244accounts for 6 percent of the establishments and employment in SIC 24.The total value of shipments in pallets and skids in 1987 was $1.5 billion,thus continuing the industry's third year of economic expansion [4, p.5-9]. The number of establishments producing pallets and skids rose morethan 67 percent from 1982 to 1986 [3, p. 4-10]. The National Wooden Palletand Container Association (NWPCA) quoted the U.S. Forest Service's 1985estimate of 2,340 firms in SIC 244 [Ex. 3-899]. The 1984 County BusinessPatterns estimated 2,103 establishments [7]. The number of employees quotedby the NWPCA was 44,600, somewhat higher than Labstat's estimate of 40,500.However, County Business Patterns estimated 38,478. Labstat estimated 40,500employees in this industry in 1986 [5]. Hourly earnings of employees inpallets and skids rose 3 percent in 1986 to $6.32. This SIC was not includedin the 1987 survey. SIC 245_Wood Buildings and Mobile HomesThis SIC includes manufacturers of wood buildings and mobile homes. The1985 value of shipments for SIC 245 ($6.0 billion) represented 11 percentof the total value of shipments for SIC 24 [3]. The value of shipmentsin SIC 245 increased 6 percent from 1981 to 1985. In 1985, the number ofemployees in SIC 245 was 10.5 percent of SIC 24. Almost 77 percent of theseemployees are production workers. The number of establishments in SIC 245in 1985 was 4.4 percent of all establishments in SIC 24 [5]. In SIC 245, the survey identified about as many small firms (fewer than20 production workers) as large firms. In the small firms, maintenancework is generally performed by production workers. In large firms maintenancework is mostly performed by dedicated maintenance workers. The manufacturers classified in SIC 245 usually have one to three basicprocesses, with potential exposure to one to three substances. Thirty percentof these processes involve exposure to these chemicals or substances onan intermittent short-term basis (up to 30 minutes) with large firms tendingto have more long-term exposures. Almost thirty-seven percent of the firmsin this SIC reported the adoption of internal exposure standards. Amongsmall firms with internal exposure standards, most have adopted OSHA PELs.Nearly 67 percent of the large firms with standards reported using theOSHA PELs; the balance indicated that they rely on ACGIH TLVs. Employeemonitoring had been performed at 40 percent of the processes. The survey found that about 16 percent of the processes are totally enclosedand 16 percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilation is usedmost frequently to control exposures at processes not enclosed. Nearly78 percent of the firms with chemical exposures have respirators for employeeuse, with a higher percentage of large firms reporting the presence ofrespirators than small firms. The combined data on exposure levels andmethods of exposure control indicate that many plants which are estimatedto incur some cost of compliance have overexposures in all processes atthat plant. Survey respondents in SIC 245 identified the presence of 10 different substances.Particulates not otherwise regulated were estimated to occur the most frequentlyat a total of 703 processes. The final rule retains the existing limitfor these particulars. Toluene, the second most frequently used chemical,was identified in coating/spraying/finishing/layup, gluing/hot pressing,and sanding/polishing/grinding. Wood dust occurs in cutting/sawing/planingand sanding/polishing/grinding operations. SIC 249_Miscellaneous Wood ProductsThis SIC covers miscellaneous wood products, and includes four four-digitSICs. SIC 249 represented 12 percent of the value of shipments for SIC24 in 1985 [4]. The value of shipments in SIC 249 ($6.6 billion) increasedalmost 24 percent over 1981. In 1985, the number of employees in SIC 249was about 15 percent of SIC 24. From 1981 to 1985, the number of employeesin SIC 249 decreased by 4 percent. The number of establishments in SIC249 in 1985 was about 14 percent of all establishments in SIC 24 [5].SIC 2491 includes establishments that treat wood, sawed or planed in otherestablishments, with creosote or other preservatives to prevent decay andto protect against fire and insects. This industry also includes facilitiesthat cut, treat, and sell poles, posts, and pilings. The Department ofCommerce reports that during 1985 there was increased use of treated woodfor home improvement projects, such as new decks and all-weather wood foundations.The market for railroad ties in 1985 was strong, as railroads replacedworn out ties. In 1986, however, sales of railroad ties declined. About30 percent of total treated wood shipments are lumber and plywood [3, p.4-14]. The Department of Commerce estimated that in 1986, the value ofshipments in this industry increased by 7 percent [4, p. 5-15]. SIC 2491represents 23 percent of the value of shipments for SIC 249. Employmentrose in 1986 by 2.7 percent [3, p. 4-14]. The number of employees in SIC2491 was almost 16 percent of SIC 249 and SIC 2491 represents almost 11percent of all establishments in SIC 249 [6].In SIC 249, the survey identified three times as many small firms (fewerthan 20 production workers) as large firms. In the small firms, maintenancework is performed for the most part by production workers or a dedicatedmaintenance staff. Large firms primarily use dedicated maintenance workersto perform maintenance duties. The manufacturers classified in SIC 249 usually have one to four basicprocesses, with potential exposure to one of four substances. Thirty-fourpercent of the processes in this SIC involve exposure to these chemicalsor substances on an intermittent short-term basis (up to 30 minutes), withlarge firms tending to have more long-term exposures. Forty-three percentof the firms in this SIC reported the adoption of internal exposure standards.Of these, most small firms have adopted OSHA PELs. Nearly 83 percent ofthe large firms with standards reported using the OSHA PELs; the balanceindicated that they rely on ACGIH TLVs. Employee monitoring had been performedat 11 percent of the processes. The survey found that about 22 percent of the processes are totally enclosedand 11 percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilation is usedmost frequently to control exposures at processes not enclosed. Roughly48 percent of the firms with chemical exposures have respirators for employeeuse, with a higher percentage of large firms reporting the presence ofrespirators than small firms. The combined data on exposure levels andmethods of exposure control indicate that many plants which are estimatedto incur some cost of compliance have overexposures in all processes atthat plant. Survey respondents identified the presence of 25 different substances inSIC 249. Particulates not otherwise regulated were estimated to occur mostfrequently at a total of 1,678 processes. Particulates were identifiedin coating/spraying/finishing/layup, cutting/sawing/planing, drying/baking,gluing/hot pressing, sanding/polishing/grinding, stamping/shaping/molding/pressing,and assembly. Wood dust exposures occur in cutting/sawing/planing and sanding/polishing/grinding.SIC 25_Furniture and FixturesManufacturers of household, office, public building, and restaurant furnitureand office and store fixtures are included in SIC 25 [1, p. 114]. The U.S.Department of Commerce states that producers of furniture and fixturesrecently have benefited from lower real interest rates, a reduction inthe value of the dollar versus other major currencies, and changes in thetax laws [3]. In addition, the U.S. furniture industry is undergoing consolidation;big firms are becoming larger and accounting for a greater share of themarket. The remaining smaller firms are finding it more difficult to compete,given the rapid increase in low-priced imports. Moreover, new manufacturingtechnologies require large capital investments and large volume, neitherof which are readily available to small firms [3, p. 44-2].For the industry, the value of shipments in 1985 increased by 31 percentover the level in 1981. In household furniture, the value of shipmentsfor 1987 increased an estimated 7 percent following a growth of 5.4 percentin 1986 [4, p. 47-2]. Although furniture manufacturers anticipate strongerdemand in the future, these manufacturers remain uncertain as to the durationand extent of increased demand. Therefore, rather than hiring additionalworkers, producers have increased the average number of hours worked bycurrent employees. This trend was evident in the wood and metal furnitureplants, where average overtime hours increased 16 percent and 24 percent,respectively, in the first half of 1986 [3, p. 44-21].Table C-1 presents employment and establishment data for SIC 25 for 1985.Almost 80 percent of the total number of employees working in SIC 25 wereproduction workers and the median rate of return on assets in the furnitureindustry was 7.3 percent in 1985.In SIC 25, the survey detected twice as many small firms (fewer than 20production workers) as large firms. In small firms, maintenance work isperformed for the most part by production workers, whereas large firmsprimarily use dedicated maintenance workers.The manufacturers classified in SIC 25 usually have one to four basic processes,with potential exposure to as many as six substances. Twenty-four percentof these processes involve exposure to these chemicals or substances onan intermittent short term basis (up to 30 minutes), with large firms tendingto have more long-term exposures. Fifty-four percent of the firms in thisSIC reported the adoption of internal exposure standards. Among small firmswith internal exposure standards, most use the OSHA PELs. About 66 percentof the large firms with standards reported using the OSHA PELs; the remainderindicated that they rely on ACGIH TLVs. Employee monitoring had been performedat 19 percent of the processes.The survey found that about 25 percent of the processes are totally enclosedand 3 percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilation is used mostfrequently to control exposures at processes not enclosed. Nearly 78 percentof the firms with exposures provide respirators for employee use, witha higher percentage of small firms reporting the presence of respiratorsthan large firms. The combined data on exposure levels and methods of exposurecontrol indicate that many plants which are estimated to incur some costof compliance do not have overexposures in all processes at that plant.Survey respondents identified the presence of 36 different substances inSIC 25. Particulates not otherwise regulated were estimated to occur mostfrequently at a total of 3,433 processes. Toluene, the second most frequentlyused chemical, was identified at processes in coating/spraying/finishing/layup,drying/baking, gluing/hot pressing, drilling/boring and sanding/polishing/grinding.Wood dust exposures occur in cutting/sawing/planing, drilling/boring, andsanding/polishing/grinding.SIC 26_Paper and Allied ProductsEstablishments in this industry process fiber from trees, wastepaper, andother fibrous materials, into end products that are used by both consumersand industry [1, p. 100]. Based on U.S. Department of Commerce estimates,the paper and allied products industry experienced an increase of 16 percentin the value of shipments from 1981 to 1985, and over 10 percent between1985 and 1986 [3]. Net profits for 27 paper industry firms were reportedto have averaged nearly 60 percent higher in the first six months of 1987than in the first half of 1986 [4, p. 6-1].The industry's overall demand patterns are closely linked to rates of changein GNP. In 1985, for example, real growth for the industry was judged tobe flat, trailing that of the GNP. The largest fluctuations in the industry'sshipments have occurred in products geared specifically for commercial-industrialuse, which are tied to the annual rate of business activity [3, p. 5-1].Table C-1 presents employment and establishment data for SIC 26 for 1985.From 1981 to 1985, employment declined by approximately 2 percent. Almost76 percent of the total number of employees were production workers [5].In 1985, the median rate of return on assets was 7.4 percent [6].Within SIC 26, there are six, three-digit SIC groups. SIC 261 includesmanufacturers of pulp from wood or other materials. The Department of Commercereports that U.S. market pulp prices dropped nearly 10 percent in the firstsix months of 1985. By the end of 1985, however, producers' pulp mill inventorieshad dropped, helping to stabilize pulp prices. About one-fourth of allmarket pulp companies either shut down some of their mills in 1985 or curtailedproduction to reduce the oversupply in the market. In 1986, the industryexperienced increased productivity, higher prices and improved worldwidedemand. For SIC 261, the value of shipments in 1987 increased by 2.7 percentover 1986. SIC 261 represents 3.5 percent of the value of shipments forSIC 26 [3, p. 5-2].SIC 262 includes manufacturers of paper from wood pulp and other fiberpulp, and manufacturers of converted paper products. SIC 263 includes manufacturersof paperboard. SIC 262 represents 11 percent of the value of shipmentsfor SIC 26. The value of shipments decreased by 3.6 percent. The numberof employees in SIC 263 was less than 1 percent of SIC 26 [5].SIC 264 includes manufacturers of coated or laminated flexible materialsused for packaging purposes. In this sector, the value of shipments, whichrepresents 36 percent of the value of shipments for SIC 26, increased by17 percent during the same period. The number of employees in SIC 264 was34 percent of SIC 26 [5]. SIC 265 includes manufacturers of setup paperboardboxes from purchased paperboard. Corrugated boxes have taken the placeof wooden shipping containers, pallets, and metal drums in the U.S. packagingmarket in recent years [3, p. 5-6]. Similarly, consumption of folding boxescontinued steadily in 1985. This pattern continued in 1986 with shipmentsof corrugated boxes increasing 5.5 percent and 3 percent for folding boxes.Several important nondurable end users of folding cartons, such as producersof beverages, dry food, textiles, sporting goods and toys, hardware, candy,and cosmetics, showed significant declines in real growth in 1985, whilethe market for boxed paper goods either grew slightly or remained fairlylevel [3, p. 5-9].Manufacturers of sanitary food containers, such as paperboard milk cartonsand paper serving and eating utensils, are also included in SIC 265. Thisindustry has been strongly influenced by the shift to plastic containers.Having experienced two successive years of decline, the industry increasedthe value of shipments by 2 percent in 1986. Since 1983, the most rapidgrowth area within the sanitary food container industry has been asepticpackaging. This is specially treated paperboard combined with plastic filmand aluminum foil.  The value of shipments for SIC 265 increased by 16 percent from 1981 to1985. This three-digit SIC represents 24 percent of the value of shipmentsfor all of SIC 26. In 1985, the number of employees in SIC 265 was 29 percentof SIC 26 [5]. SIC 266 includes manufacturers of building paper and buildingboard from wood pulp and other fibrous materials. Trends in employmentand value of shipments have followed overall trends in SIC 26. In SIC 26, the survey identified half as many small firms (fewer than 20production workers) as large firms. In small firms, maintenance work isperformed largely by production workers, although some firms use outsidecontractors. Large firms generally use a separate maintenance staff toperform maintenance duties. The manufacturers classified in SIC 26 usually have one to six basic processes,with potential exposure to as many as seven chemicals or substances. Twenty-ninepercent of these processes involve exposure to these chemicals or substanceson an intermittent short-term basis (up to 30 minutes), with large firmstending to have more long-term exposures. Firms in this SIC are equallydivided between those adopting no internal exposure standards and thoseadopting OSHA PELs. Among small firms with internal exposure standards,all have adopted OSHA PELs. Nearly 81 percent of the large firms with standardsreported adopting the OSHA PELs; the balance indicated that they rely onACGIH TLVs. Employee monitoring had been performed at 36 percent of theprocesses. The survey found that about 25 percent of the processes are totally enclosedand 4 percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilation is used mostfrequently to control exposures at processes not enclosed. Approximately42 percent of the firms with chemical exposures have respirators for employeeuse, with a higher percentage of small firms reporting the presence ofrespirators than large firms. The combined data on exposure levels andmethods of exposure control indicate that many plants which are estimatedto incur some cost of compliance have overexposures in all processes atthat plant.  Survey respondents indentified the presence of 46 different chemicals orsubstances in SIC 26. Particulate not otherwise classified occurred themost frequently at a total of 1,753 processs. Cellulose was identifiedat 664 processes. The final rule retains the existing limits for both particulatesnot otherwise regulated and cellulose. Wood dust exposures occurred incutting/sawing/planing.SIC 27_Printing, Publishing, and Allied Industries This industry is divided into a publishing sector, a printing sector anda sector of related services. The publishing sector includes newspaperpublishing (SIC 271), periodical publishing (SIC 272), book publishing(SIC 2731), miscellaneous publishing (SIC 274) and greeting card publishing(SIC 277). The printing sector includes commercial printing (SIC 275),book printing (SIC 2732), and printing trade services (SIC 279). The relatedservices sector includes manifold business forms (SIC 276) and blankbooksand bookbinding (SIC 278) [1, pp. 106-110]. There were approximately 84,279 establishments in the printing and publishingbusiness in 1985. The majority of these firms (84.1 percent) had fewerthan 20 employees, and the mean establishment size was 17 employees. Thefirms in SIC 27 had 1.4 million employees and 789,000 production workers[Table C-1]. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the value ofshipments for all printing and publishing establishments in 1986 ($118.6billion) was 5.2 percent of the value of shipments for all manufacturingindustries. Most of the value of shipments in SIC 27 is from the commercialprinting sector (32.1 percent) [4]. In 1985, the median rate of returnon assets was 8.2 percent for the printing and publishing industry [6].Foreign trade has not been a major concern for this industry in the past,but imports are beginning to increase at a steady rate. The respectivevalues of imports and exports were very close in 1987, with $1.6 billionin imports and $1.5 billion in exports [3, p. 29-2]. The newspaper industry has improved its performance after several yearsof slow growth. The value of shipments for SIC 271 was $29.2 billion in1986. Total employment rose an estimated 2.2 percent in 1986 to 420,000employees, but production employment remained virtually unchanged at 151,900employees. Sales revenues increased by 8.9 percent, from $14.8 billionin 1986 to $16.2 billion in 1987. Advertising revenues rose slightly, butmost of this gain was due to rate increases and growth in classified advolume. Total net worth increased by 14.2 percent from 1986 to 1987 [10].The periodical industry has experienced moderate growth in both advertisingreceipts and circulation. Advertising revenue increased about 4 percentin 1987, while circulation revenues increased slightly due to the increasein subscriptions for consumer magazines. There was another large increasein the number of new publications entering the market; over 250 new periodicalswere published in 1987 [3, p. 29-6]. The value of shipments of the periodicalindustry was $15.7 billion in 1986, an increase of 3.1 percent over the1985 figure of $15.2 billion. The total number of employees in the periodicalindustry increased in 1986 (98,100 employees), while the number of productionworkers decreased (14,200 employees). The periodical industry has the lowestratio of production workers to total employees (14.5 percent) within SIC27.  The commercial printing industry (SIC 275) has been very profitable overthe last decade. The 1987 value of shipments ($40.9 billion) increased7.5 percent over the 1986 value of shipments ($38.0 billion). Between 1980and 1985, the value of shipments increased by 11.5 percent compounded annually.Total employment and production employment have also been increasing substantiallyfrom 1986 to 1987 (3.7 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively). The outlookfor this industry is steady growth [3, pp. 29-12 to 29-14].Both book publishing and printing showed strong gains over the last severalyears. Value of shipments and total employment increased by 5.5 percentand 0.7 percent, respectively, from 1985 to 1986. Spurred by the increasein school enrollment, sales of textbooks were projected to reach 29 percentof total industry sales in 1988. Book printing usually follows the pathof book publishing, increasing substantially when book publishing has astrong year [3, pp. 29-9 to 29-13].Miscellaneous publishing and printing consists of newsletters, catalogs,directories, greeting cards, and business forms. This industry has seensteady gains due in part to the success of mail-order catalogs, telephonedirectories, and newsletters [3, pp. 29-13 to 29-19].In this SIC, the survey identified six times as many small firms (fewerthan 20 production workers) as large firms. In the small firms, approximatelytwo-thirds of maintenance work is performed by production workers. Outsidecontractors do approximately one-fourth of maintenance work, and maintenancestaff and other sources make up the remainder. Large firms divide maintenancework about equally between a dedicated maintenance staff, production workers,and outside contractors.The manufacturers classified in this SIC usually have one to three basicprocesses, with potential exposure to as many as six chemicals. Employeesare exposed to these chemicals on an intermittent short term basis (upto 30 minutes) or continuously (up to 8 hours per day) with large firmstending to have more long-term exposures. Small firms generally have nointernal exposure standards; when they do, the OSHA PELs are followed aboutfifteen percent of the time. Over one-half of large firms reported usingthe OSHA PELs; the balance indicated that they have no standards or theyrely on ACGIH TLVs or NIOSH RELs. Air monitoring data were provided forabout one-tenth of the processes found in all plants, and for about one-thirdof the processes found in large firms.The survey found that about two-thirds of the processes are totally enclosedand less than one percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilationand general dilution are used most frequently to control exposures at processesnot enclosed or outdoors. In less than five percent of the firms with chemicalexposures, production workers use respirators with a higher percentageof large firms using respirators than small firms.Survey respondents identified isopropyl alcohol, stoddard solvent, andmethyl alcohol among the chemicals most prevalent in this SIC. These areused in lithographic printing and platemaking and letterpress printingwhich were the processes most frequently listed by respondents. Toluene,xylene, and trichloroethylene were also identified in the survey. A largecommercial printer, R.R. Donnelly and Sons, confirmed the presence of toluenein press operations and expressed concern over the ability to meet theproposed levels, especially during cleaning [Ex. 3-916].SIC 28_Chemicals and Allied ProductsSIC 28 includes establishments that produce basic chemicals, and establishmentsthat manufacture products using chemical processes. There are three generalclasses of products: (1) basic chemicals, such as acids, alkalies, salts,and organic chemicals; (2) chemical products to be used in further manufacturing,such as synthetic fibers, plastics materials, dry colors, and pigments;and (3) finished chemical products to be used for consumption, such asdrugs, cosmetics, and soaps; or to be used as materials or supplies inother industries, such as paints, fertilizers, and explosives [1, p. 132].The chemical and allied products industries have experienced small butsteady growth over the recent past. Total shipments by the chemical industryincreased approximately 3.1 percent in 1987, following a 3.5 percent gainin 1986 [3]. Chemical prices have been stable since 1982, due to steadyor declining energy costs. Like many other U.S. industries, various sectorswithin the chemical industry are undergoing structural changes, such asmergers, plant closings, sale of plants, and other adjustments. This industryemploys approximately 5 percent of all industry workers, but more than10 percent of all U.S. scientists and engineers. SIC 28 experienced a 6percent decline in employment between 1981 and 1985. In 1985, 55.4 percentof the total number of employees in SIC 28 were production workers. Thevalue of shipments increased 8.9 percent during the 1981 to 1985 time period.The median rate of return on assets in the chemical industry was 6.3 percent[6].Within SIC 28, there are eight, three-digit SICs, which are described below.SIC 281_Industrial Inorganic ChemicalsThis SIC includes establishments that manufacture basic industrial inorganicchemicals. SIC 281 represented 10.3 percent of the value of shipments ofSIC 28 in 1985 [2]. The value of shipments increased 12.9 percent since1981, and employment declined by 12 percent. Production workers equaledalmost 51 percent of all workers. The number of establishments in SIC 281was 14.5 percent of all establishments in SIC 28 [Table C-1].SIC 281 is subdivided into four groups. Examples of the products of eachfour-digit SIC are given below.<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>SIC 2812 Products</T3>_Chlorine, soda ash, caustic potash, causticsoda, washing soda, and sodium bicarbonate.<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>SIC 2813 Products</T3>_Oxygen, acetylene, argon, carbon dioxide, andhydrogen.<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>SIC 2816 Products</T3>_Color pigments, iron colors, iron oxide, leadoxide pigments, mineral colors, titanium pigments, and zinc oxide pigments.<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>SIC 2819 Products</T3>_Sulfuric, hydrochloric, and hydrofluoric acids.In SIC 281, the survey identified three times as many small firms (fewerthan 20 production workers) as large firms. In the small firms, maintenancework is performed for the most part by production workers, although somefirms employ dedicated maintenance workers. Large firms predominantly employworkers specifically for maintenance duties.The manufacturers classified in this SIC usually have one to two basicprocesses, with potential exposure to as many as six substances. Fifty-twopercent of these processes involve exposure to chemicals or substanceson an intermittent short-term basis (up to 30 minutes), with large firmstending to have longer-term exposures. Most firms in SIC 281 reported theadoption of OSHA PELs as their internal standards. Employee monitoringhad been performed at 67 percent of the processes. The survey found thatabout 32 percent of the processes are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilationis used most frequently to control exposures at processes not enclosed.About 24 percent of the firms with chemical exposures have respiratorsfor employee use, with a higher percentage of small firms reporting thepresence of respirators than large firms. The combined data on exposurelevels and methods of exposure control indicate that most plants whichare estimated to incur some cost of compliance do not have overexposuresin all processes at that plant.Survey respondents identified the presence of 58 different substances inSIC 281. Carbon dioxide was estimated to occur the most frequently at atotal of 292 processes. Carbon dioxide was identified in recovery/reprocessing,packaging/bagging, loading/offloading/receiving/handling, process inspection,reaction/fermentation, and separation. Another common substance, sodiumhydroxide, was identified in boilers.SIC 282_Plastics Materials and SyntheticsThis SIC includes manufacturers of plastics materials and synthetic resins,synthetic rubbers, and cellulosic and other manmade fibers. Plastics makeup a variety of products which are used in diverse markets. Packaging andconstruction account for over 50 percent of consumption, with the remaindergoing into the transportation, electronics, and medical industries [3].SIC 282 represents almost 17 percent of the value of shipments of SIC 28.The value of shipments in SIC 282 increased 9.2 percent over the period1981 to 1985 [2]. Industry shipments of plastics in 1986 gained 6.3 percentas volume rose in response to slightly increased demand for materials.However, declining prices of plastic materials held shipments to a 2 percentincrease [3, p. 14-1].Table C-1 gives employment and establishment data for this segment. Thenumber of employees in SIC 282 in 1985 was almost 16 percent of SIC 28and the number of establishments was 8 percent of all establishments inthat SIC. In 1985, employment in SIC 282 declined by 12 percent, and productionworkers equaled 66.5 percent of all workers [5].SIC 282 is subdivided into four groups. Examples of the products from eachof these four-digit SICs are given below.<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>SIC 2821 Products</T3>_Cellulose plastics materials, phenolic and othertar acid resins, acrylic resins, polyethylene resins, coumarone-indeneand petroleum polymer resins, and casein plastics.<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>SIC 2822 Products</T3>_Copolymers of butadiene and styrene, or butadieneand acrylonitrile, and polybutadienes.<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>SIC 2823 Products</T3>_Cellulose, rayon, and triacetate fibers.<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>SIC 2824 Products</T3>_Fibers of acrylic, acrylonitrile, polyvinylester, and nylon.In SIC 282, the survey identified twice as many small firms (fewer than20 production workers) as large firms. In small firms, maintenance workis either performed by production workers or dedicated maintenance workers.Large firms primarily employ workers specifically for maintenance duties. The manufacturers classified in SIC 282 usually have one to six basic processes,with numerous firms having exposures to as many as six different substances.Forty-five percent of these processes involve exposure to these chemicalsor substances on an intermittant short-term basis (up to 30 minutes), withlarge firms tending to have more short-term exposures. Most firms in thisSIC have adopted OSHA PELs as their internal standards. Of the small firmswith internal exposure standards, most have adopted OSHA PELs or ACGIHTLVs. About 49 percent of large firms reported using OSHA PELs, with 36percent reporting the adoption of ACGIH TLVs.  The survey found that about 33 percent of the processes are totally enclosedand 24 percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilation is usedmost frequently to control exposures at processes not enclosed. More than28 percent of the firms with chemical exposures have respirators, withan equal percentage of small and large firms reporting the availabilityof respirators for employee use. The combined data on exposure levels andmethods of exposure control indicate that many plants which are estimatedto have some cost of compliance have overexposures in some, but not all,processes in the plant.  Survey respondents identified the presence of 53 different substances inSIC 282. Styrene was estimated to occur the most frequently at a totalof 209 processes. Styrene was identified in recovery/reprocessing/reclamation,drying/baking, separation, blending/mixing/formulating, packaging/bagging,extrusion, crushing/grinding/calcining, loading/offloading/receiving/handling,and reaction/fermentation. Another common substance in SIC 282 was isopropylalcohol, which occurred in eight different processes.  SIC 283_Drugs  This group includes establishments that manufacture, fabricate, or processmedicinal chemicals and pharmaceutical products. The value of shipmentsin SIC 283 has increased 40 percent from 1981 to 1985 [2]. SIC 283 represents16 percent of the value of shipments of SIC 28 and almost 20 percent ofthe number of employees. The U.S. Department of Commerce estimated thatthe pharmaceutical industry experienced a 6.3 percent increase in the valueof shipments in 1986. However, after adjusting for price changes, thisgrowth rate was closer to 1.8 percent. Productivity also increased in 1986,growing by approximately 2.6 percent [3, p. 17-1].  As seen in Table C-1, the number of establishments in SIC 283 was almost12 percent of all establishments in SIC 28. Employment increased by 3 percentsince 1981, and production workers equaled approximately 46 percent ofall workers in SIC 283. Agar, vitamins, antibiotics, vaccines, and virusesare examples of the products of this SIC.  In SIC 283, the survey identified three times as many small firms (fewerthan 20 production workers) as large firms. In the small firms, maintenancework is generally performed by either dedicated maintenance workers orby general production workers. In large firms, most maintenance work isperformed by workers specifically employed for maintenance duties.  The manufacturers classified in SIC 283 usually have one to five basicprocesses, with potential exposure to one to three substances. Fifty percentof all employees are exposed to these chemicals or substances on an intermittentbasis (up to 30 minutes), with small firms tending to have more long-termexposures. Among small firms with exposure standards, most have adoptedOSHA PELs. Among large firms, a significant percentage have adopted ACGIHTLVs, although most still rely on OSHA PELs. Employee monitoring had beenperformed at 34 percent of the processes.  The survey found that about 53 percent of the processes are totally enclosedand 4 percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilation is used mostfrequently to control exposures at processes not enclosed. In 21 percentof the firms with chemical exposures, respirators were available for employeeuse, with a higher percentage of large firms reporting the presence ofrespirators than small firms. The combined data on exposure levels andmethods of exposure control indicate that very few plants which are estimatedto incur some cost of compliance have overexposures at all processes inthat plant.  Survey respondents identified the presence of 40 different substances inSIC 283. Isopropyl alcohol was estimated to occur the most frequently ata total of 577 processes. Isopropyl alcohol was identified in boilers,coating/spraying/finishing/layup, drying/baking, blending/mixing/formulating,packaging/bagging, loading/offloading/receiving/handling, reaction/fermentation,and separation.  SIC 284_Soaps, Cleaners, and Toilet Goods  This SIC includes manufacturers of detergents, emulsifiers, cosmetics,and producers of glycerin. SIC 284 represents 15 percent of the value ofshipments of SIC 28 [3]. The value of shipments in SIC 284 increased 20percent from 1981 to 1985 [2]. In 1986, the value of shipments was estimatedat $31 billion, which represents about a 4 percent increase over 1985 values[3, p. 16-1].  The number of employees in this SIC was almost 15 percent of SIC 28 andthe number of establishments was almost 22 percent. In 1985, employmentin SIC 284 had increased by 1 percent since 1981, and production workersequaled approximately 63 percent of all workers in SIC 284 [5].  There are four subgroups within SIC 284. Examples of the products producedby each four-digit SIC are given below. <ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>SIC 2841 Products</T3>_Soap, synthetic organic detergents, inorganicalkaline detergents, and crude and refined glycerin from vegetable andanimal fats and oils.  <ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>SIC 2842 Products</T3>_Household, institutional, and industrial plantdisinfectants, nonpersonal deodorants, dry cleaning preparations, householdbleaches, and other sanitation products.  <ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>SIC 2843 Products</T3>_Textile and leather finishing agents, solubleoil and greases.  <ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>SIC 2844 Products</T3>_Perfumes, cosmetics, home permanent kits, shampoos,shaving products, and talcum powder. In SIC 284, the survey identified twice as many small firms (fewer than20 production workers) as large firms. Maintenance work in small firmsis basically performed by production workers, while dedicated maintenanceworkers and in some firms production workers, handle this task in largefirms.  The manufacturers classified in SIC 284 usually have one to three basicprocesses, with potential exposure to one to eight substances. Fifty percentof all employees are exposed to these chemicals or substances on an intermittentbasis (up to 30 minutes), with large firms tending to have more long-termexposures. Most firms in this SIC have adopted OSHA PELs. Employee monitoringhad been performed at 26 percent of the processes.  The survey found that roughly 38 percent of the processes are totally enclosedand 9 percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilation is used mostfrequently to control exposures at processes not enclosed. Nearly 44 percentof the firms with chemical exposures have respirators for employee use,with a higher percentage of large firms reporting the presence of respiratorsthan small firms. The combined data on exposure levels and methods of controlindicate that very few plants which are estimated to incur some cost ofcompliance have overexposures at all processes at that plant.  Survey respondents identified the presence of 52 different substances inSIC 284. Sodium hydroxide was estimated to occur most frequently at a totalof 452 processes. Sodium hydroxide was identified in drying/baking, blending/mixing/formulating,packaging/bagging, loading/offloading/receiving/handling, reaction/fermentation,and separation.  SIC 285_Paints and Allied Products  This SIC includes manufacturers of paints and allied paint products suchas varnishes, shellacs, and paint removers. The paint industry grew byabout 5.3 percent in 1986, compared to 1985's decline of 2.9 percent [3,p. 15-1]. Estimated shipments for 1986 were $11.1 billion, of which architecturalcoatings accounted for about 41 percent, followed by product coatings (35percent) and specialty products (24 percent) [3, p. 15-2].  SIC 285 represents about 6 percent of the value of shipments of SIC 28.The value of shipments increased almost 26 percent from 1981 to 1985 [2].The number of employees in SIC 285 was 6 percent of SIC 28 and the numberof establishments was 9 percent. In SIC 285, the survey identified three-fourths as many small firms (fewerthan 20 production workers) as large firms. In small firms, maintenancework is either performed by production workers or dedicated maintenanceworkers. Large firms predominantly use workers dedicated to maintenanceduties.The manufacturers classified in SIC 285 usually have one to five basicprocesses, with numerous firms having potential exposures to as many asseven different substances. About 40 percent of the employees are exposedto these chemicals or substances on an intermittent short-term basis (upto 30 minutes), with large firms tending to have longer-term exposures.Most firms in this SIC have adopted OSHA PELs or ACGIH TLVs as their internalstandard; about 58 percent of the firms reported using OSHA PELs and 19percent reported the adoption of ACGIH TLVs.The survey found that about 34 percent of the processes are totally enclosedand 11 percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilation is usedmost frequently to control exposures at processes not enclosed. About 17percent of the firms with chemical exposures have respirators for employeeuse, with a higher percentage of large firms reporting the presence ofrespirators. The combined data on exposure levels and methods of exposurecontrol indicate that most plants which are estimated to incur some costof compliance have overexposures in some, but not all, processes at thatplant.Survey respondents identified the presence of 39 different substances inSIC 285. Stoddard solvent was estimated to occur most frequently at a totalof 941 processes. Stoddard solvent was identified in recovery/reprocessing/reclamation,coating/spraying/finishing/layup, drying/baking, blending/mixing/formulating,packaging/bagging, crushing/grinding/calcining, loading/offloading/receiving/handling,reaction/fermentation, and separation. Another common substance in thisSIC was ethylene glycol, which occurred in seven processes.SIC 286_Industrial Organic ChemicalsThis SIC includes manufacturers of a variety of industrial organic chemicals.Industry shipments of organic chemicals increased approximately 2 percentover 1985, which was the same level of growth experienced in the previousyear [3]. In 1985, the value of shipments for SIC 286 was $41.8 million,representing 21 percent of the value of shipments of SIC 28 [2]. The numberof employees in SIC 286 was almost 11 percent of SIC 28 and the numberof establishments was approximately 7 percent. Employment in SIC 286 increasedby 10 percent, and production workers equaled 51 percent of all workers[Table C-1].There are three subgroups in SIC 286. Examples of products for each four-digitSIC are given below.<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>SIC 2861 Products</T3>_Hardwood and softwood distillation products,wood and gum naval stores, charcoal, natural dyestuffs and natural tanningmaterials.<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>SIC 2865 Products</T3>_Toluene, benzene, synthetic organic dyes andpigments.<ITAG tagnum="15"/><T3>SIC 2869 Products</T3>_Alcohols, caprolactam, and ethylene glycol.In SIC 286, the survey identified three-fourths as many small firms (fewerthan 20 production workers) as large firms. Small firms primarily use productionworkers to perform maintenance tasks. Large firms, on the other hand, primarilyuse dedicated maintenance workers to perform maintenance duties. Some smalland large firms use outside contractors.The manufacturers classified in this SIC usually have two to four basicprocesses, with potential exposure to as many as six substances. Fifty-sixpercent of the employees are exposed to these chemicals or substances onan intermittent short-term basis (up to 30 minutes), with large firms tendingto have longer-term exposure. Most firms in SIC 286 have adopted OSHA PELsor ACGIH TLVs as their internal standards. Employee monitoring had beenperformed at 78 percent of the processes.The survey found that about 34 percent of the processes are totally enclosedand that nearly 38 percent of the processes are located outdoors. Localexhaust ventilation is used most frequently to control exposures at processesnot enclosed. Roughly 34 percent of the firms with chemical exposures haverespirators for employee use, with a higher percentage of large firms reportingthe presence of respirators than small firms. The combined data on exposurelevels and methods of exposure control indicate that very few plants whichare estimated to incur some cost of compliance have overexposures in allprocesses at that plant.Survey respondents identified the presence of 57 different substances inSIC 286. Particulates not otherwise regulated and ethylene glycol wereestimated to occur most frequently at a total of 222 and 184 processes,respectively. OSHA has retained the existing limit for particulates nototherwise regulated.SIC 287_Agricultural ChemicalsThis SIC includes establishments that manufacture agricultural chemicalsand pesticides. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the 1985value of shipments of SIC 287 ($14.8 billion) represents 7.5 percent ofthe value of shipments of SIC 28 [2]. The value of shipments in SIC 287decreased 9.6 percent from 1981 to 1985. Employment in SIC 287 represented5 percent of SIC 28, but has declined by 16 percent since 1981. The numberof establishments in SIC 287 was approximately 9 percent of all establishmentsin SIC 28 and production workers account for approximately 62 percent oftotal employment [Table C-1].SIC 2873 includes manufacturers of nitrogenous and mixed fertilizers. Thevalue of shipments of nitrogenous fertilizers in 1986 was $2.82 billion,a decrease over 1985 shipments [3, p. 13-1].SIC 2874 includes manufacturers of phosphatic fertilizers, such as phosphoricacid, made from phosphate rock. The value of shipments of phosphatic fertilizersin 1986 was $3.71 billion, which represents a decrease over 1985 shipments[3, p. 13-3]. Ammonia and phosphoric acid are two substances with potentialexposure problems that are produced and/or used in SIC 2874.SIC 2875 includes establishments that mix fertilizers from purchased fertilizermaterials. SIC 2879 includes formulators and preparers of ready-to-useagricultural and household pest control chemicals, such as fungicides,insecticides, and herbicides.In SIC 287, the survey detected more than twice as many small firms (fewerthan 20 production workers) as large firms. In small firms, maintenancework is mostly performed by production workers or dedicated maintenanceworkers. Large firms primarily employ workers specifically for maintenanceduties, although some large firms use outside contractors.The manufacturers classified in SIC 287 usually have two to four basicprocesses, with numerous firms having potential exposures to as many asfive different substances. Thirty-three percent of the processes involveexposure to these chemicals or substances on an intermittent short-termbasis (up to 30 minutes), with large firms tending to have longer-termexposures. Thirty-nine percent of the firms in this SIC reported the adoptionof an internal exposure standard. Twenty-three percent of the small firmsreported the adoption of an internal exposure standard. Nearly 45 percentof the large firms with standards reported using the OSHA PELs; the remainderindicated that they use ACGIH TLVs. The survey found that about 43 percentof the processes are totally enclosed and about 37 percent are locatedoutdoors. Local exhaust ventilation is used most frequently to controlexposures at processes not enclosed. About 42 percent of the firms withchemical exposures have respirators for employee use, with a higher percentageof small firms than large firms reporting the presence of respirators.The combined data on exposure levels and methods of exposure control indicatethat most plants which are estimated to incur some cost of compliance donot have overexposures at all processes in that plant.Survey respondents identified the presence of 32 different substances.Ammonia and particulates not otherwise regulated were estimated to occurthe most frequently in a total of 344 and 334 processes, respectively.Ammonia was identified in drying/baking, blending/mixing/formulating, packaging/bagging,crushing/grinding/calcining, loading/offloading/receiving/handling, reaction/fermentation,and separation.SIC 289_Miscellaneous Chemical ProductsThis group includes manufacturers of miscellaneous chemical products. For1985, SIC 289 represented 7 percent ($14.6 billion) of the value of shipmentsof SIC 28 [2]. From 1981 to 1985, the value of shipments in SIC 289 increased18.3 percent. The number of employees in SIC 289 was almost 10 percentof SIC 28 and has remained unchanged since 1981. The number of establishmentsin SIC 289 was approximately 19 percent of all establishments in SIC 28.Production workers equalled approximately 62 percent of all workers [TableC-1].SIC 2891 includes manufacturers of industrial and household adhesives andsealants. Industry shipments for adhesives and sealants in 1986 amountedto $4.2 billion, of which about 60 percent were by synthetic resins andrubber-based adhesives; 20 percent by sealant and caulking compounds; andthe remaining 20 percent by natural-based adhesives and miscellaneous compounds[3, p. 15-3].SIC 2892 includes manufacturers of explosives, such as TNT (trinitrotoluene).Ethylene glycol dinitrate is one of the products of this SIC which mayhave potential exposure problems.SIC 2893 includes manufacturers of printing ink and SIC 2895 includes manufacturersof carbon black. SIC 2899 includes manufacturers of miscellaneous chemicalproducts, not elsewhere classified. Among these three SICs, ethylene glycol,nitrotoluene, hexylene glycol, trimellitic anhydride, and coal dust areall substances with suspected exposure problems that are either producedor used in these sectors.In SIC 289, the survey identified less than half as many small firms (fewerthan 20 production workers) as large firms. In the small firms, maintenancework is performed largely by production workers, whereas large firms primarilyrely on a separate maintenance staff.The manufacturers classified in SIC 289 usually have one to four basicprocesses, with potential exposure to one to five substances. Forty-sevenpercent of all employees are exposed to these chemicals or substances onan intermittent basis (up to 30 minutes), with large firms tending to havemore long-term exposures. Sixty-five percent of the firms in this SIC reportedthe adoption of internal exposure standards. Roughly 48 percent of thesmall firms and 36 percent of the large firms with standards have adoptedOSHA PELs. Employee monitoring had been performed at 67 percent of theprocesses.The survey found that nearly 29 percent of the processes are totally enclosedand 12 percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilation is usedmost frequently to control exposures at processes not enclosed. Almost28 percent of the firms with chemical exposures have respirators for employeeuse, with a higher percentage of large firms reporting the presence ofrespirators than small firms. The combined data on exposure levels andmethods of exposure control indicate that very few plants which are estimatedto incur some cost of compliance have overexposures at all processes inthat plant.Survey respondents identified the presence of 50 different substances inSIC 289. Toluene was estimated to occur the most frequently at a totalof 661 processes. Toluene was identified in packaging/bagging, blending/mixing/formulating,crushing/grinding/calcining, loading/offloading/receiving/handling, andreaction/fermentation.SIC 29_Petroleum and Related IndustriesThis industry is divided into petroleum refiners and producers of otherrelated products. Petroleum refineries (SIC 2911) produce fuels (such asgasoline, kerosene, and distillate and residual fuel oils) as well as lubricantsand chemical feedstocks. These products are produced through straight distillationof crude oil, redistillation of unfinished petroleum derivatives, cracking,or other processes. Other producers in this sector manufacture asphaltand tar products for paving and roofing (SIC 295) and other lubricatingoils, greases, and petroleum and coal products (SIC 299) [1, pp. 127-128].The 1985 value of shipments for SIC 29 ($179.1 billion) was 7.9 percentof the value of shipments for all manufacturing industries. Petroleum refiningdominates SIC 29, accounting for 94 percent of this sector's value of shipments[3, pp. 10-8 to 10-14].The number and size distribution of establishments in SIC 29 are shownin Table C-1, as is total employment. Relative to value of output, SIC29 has few establishments and low employment, accounting for less than1 percent of all manufacturing establishments and employment [7,     pp.10, 30].About 40 percent of the establishments in SIC 29 are petroleum refineries[10], which are large and extremely capital intensive. Production is highlyautomated; enclosed processes are used throughout. Mean employment sizeis 105 employees. By contrast, plants in the other industries within SIC29 are relatively small and less capital intensive, and processes are generallynot automated. Mean establishment size in the rest of SIC 29 is 19 employees.The real value of petroleum product shipments, consumption of petroleumproducts, petroleum refining capacity, and employment in SIC 29 all peakedbetween 1977 and 1981. There has been an upturn since 1985, resulting principallyfrom a sharp decline in crude oil prices in the first half of 1986, whichstimulated demand for refinery products [3, pp. 10-1 and 10-2]. Demandfor petroleum products is expected to grow only slightly in the short run.In the past, trends have been strongly influenced by sharp fluctuationsin the price of crude oil [3, pp. 10-3 and 10-4]. In general, low pricesfor crude oil translate into increased activity for domestic refineries.The profitability of firms in SIC 29 is low. The median 1985 rate of returnon assets (4.4 percent) is the second lowest median return on assets amongall 20 two-digit manufacturing industries [6].Docket comments pertaining to this industry were concerned exclusivelywith one regulated substance, asphalt. Asphalt is manufactured in petroleumrefineries (SIC 2911) and is used to make paving materials (SIC 2951) androofing materials (SIC 2952). Many commenters [see, for example, Exs. 3-162;3-420B; 3-895; 3-240; 3-658; 8-5, 581, 3-493B; 3-294; 3-64; 3-22; 3-74;3-354; 3-966; Tr. 8/9/88, pp. 9-63, 9-65, 9-66, 9-79] provided informationon asphalt paving manufacturing, employee exposures, potential costs, andpossible impacts; other asphalt applications were not commented on in docketsubmissions.Information submitted by firms and trade groups concerned with the manufactureand application of hot-mix asphalt indicated that the manufacture of asphaltpaving material falls within SIC 2951, while the activity of paving fallswithin SIC 1611, Street and Highway Construction. Because the scope ofthis rulemaking is restricted exclusively to general industry, OSHA hasdetermined that it is most appropriate at this time to defer regulationof asphalt fumes until the Agency has had sufficient time to address thecomplex health issues associated with this substance and to analyze theimpact on the construction industry of establishing a PEL for this substance.In SIC 29, three out of four firms identified by the survey were smallfirms (firms with fewer than 20 production workers). In about half of thesmall firms, maintenance work is performed by production workers; the remainderof small firms employ maintenance workers more often than they use outsidecontractors for maintenance. Large firms most commonly have a dedicatedmaintenance staff.Most employee exposures are intermittent and short-term (up to 30 minutes);of the remaining employee exposures, most are for durations of from 4 to8 hours (for large firms), or of 1 to 8 hours (for small firms). A slightmajority of small firms use some internal exposure standards; most of thosethat do use internal exposure standards report using OSHA PELs or ACGIHTLVs. Almost 95 percent of larger firms report using internal exposurestandards; of these, most report using OSHA PELs, and about one-quarterreported using ACGIH TLVs. Air monitoring data were collected for overhalf of the processes in large plants, but for less than one-fourth ofthe processes in small plants.The survey found that about 30 percent of the processes are totally enclosedand almost two-thirds of plant processes are located outdoors. Productionworkers use respirators in over 25 percent of processes for firms reportingchemical exposures; however, small firms report a lower percentage of respiratoruse than do large firms.Survey respondents identified the presence of 68 different substances inSIC 29. Toluene was estimated to occur the most frequently at a total of175 processes; trichlororethylene was estimated to occur at a total of162 processes. Toluene was identified in batch process/coke productionand removal, blending/mixing/formulating, and process inspection. Trichloroethylenewas identified in blending/mixing/formulating, drying/baking, loading/offloadingand measurement.SIC 30_Rubber and Miscellaneous Plastics Products IndustryThis industry sector consists of establishments that manufacture a varietyof products from plastic resins and from natural, synthetic, and reclaimedrubber. Although plastic products account for the largest share of thevalue of shipments of this industry group, the industry also manufacturesa variety of rubber products, including tires, inner tubes, footwear, andbelting [1, pp. 129-132]. The value of shipments for 1985 was $71.3 billion.This industry is dominated by the miscellaneous plastic products sector(SIC 307 until 1987 and now SIC 308), which accounts for 81 percent ofthe establishments, 66 percent of the value of shipments, and 70 percentof the employment for the entire industry group [10]. The tire and innertube (SIC 301) sector and the miscellaneous rubber products (SIC 306) sectorare the other major components of this industry.Similar processes are used in manufacturing plastic and rubber products,with the nature and form of the final product determining the process morethan the product's components. A product's components, however, determinethe types of chemical exposures employees experience. Examples of particularlyserious types of exposures are those to the foaming agents that are usedin the production of foam rubber or plastic foams and to the styrene usedto produce polystyrene or in lamination processes.As shown in Table C-1, this industry sector is characterized by relativelysmall establishments; 61 percent of establishments have fewer than 20 employees,with an average of 43 employees per establishment. Employment in this industrygrew by 7 percent between 1981 and 1985, with growth in the tire and innertube and miscellaneous plastics product sectors outpacing declines in othersectors [4]. Firms in this industry have above-average profits for manufacturingindustries, with a 7.7 percent median rate of return on assets comparedwith a 7.0 percent median for all manufacturing firms [6].The only comments received by OSHA that were related to SIC 30, Rubberand Miscellaneous Plastics, concerned the Agency's proposed 50-ppm TWAand 100-ppm STEL limits for styrene [See, for example, Ex. 3-742; Tr. 8/8/88,pp. 95, 177, 178, 180]. Styrene is used in this sector to make a varietyof rubber and plastic products, including polyester resins, polystyrene,and a widely used form of artificial rubber. Commenters stated that a smallnumber of the facilities in this sector, i.e., those using styrene resinsin open-mold processes, would encounter technological problems in attemptingto comply with the proposed styrene limits [Ex. 3-742, pp. 34-36; Tr. 8/3/88,p. 5-95]. This issue is addressed in Chapter F_Technological Feasibility.Open-mold processes were described by these commenters as operations inwhich the styrene resin is applied directly to the surface of a mold (generallyby means of a spray gun) and is then rolled by hand to build up successivelayers of reinforced plastic. When the objects being molded are large,as is the case with boats or underground storage tanks, commenters explainedthat it is more difficult to position and use local exhaust ventilationeffectively [Ex. 3-742, p. 48]. Although most open-mold processes in thissector are involved in the manufacture of plastic bathroom fixtures (showers,tubs, hot tubs, and spas), makers of underground storage tanks and culturedmarble products also rely on the open-molding process.The Styrene Information and Research Council estimates that 265 facilitiesin this sector use this process to produce bathroom fixtures [Ex. 3-742,p. 105], and the Cultured Marble Institute estimates that a total of 1062facilities, employing 17,000 workers, manufacture cultured marble products[Tr. 8/3/88, pp. 5-77, 5-177, 5-180]. These firms, like other styrene-usingfirms in this SIC code, are generally small, privately held firms. TheCultured Marble Institute characterized the typical open-mold-process firmin this sector as a company that employs 17 persons and has annual salesof less than $1 million. The issues of technological feasibility that pertainto users of this process in SIC 30 are discussed in detail in the TechnologicalFeasibility chapter, below.In this SIC, over 60 percent of the firms identified by the survey weresmall firms (firms having fewer than 20 production workers.) In the smallfirms, maintenance work is most commonly performed by production workers,although about one-quarter of small firms use outside contractors for maintenancework, and one in seven has a dedicated maintenance staff. Over two-thirdsof large firms have dedicated maintenance staff; the remaining large firmsuse production workers for maintenance more often than they use outsidecontractors.Most firms reported using from one to four processes. In SIC 307 (miscellaneousplastics manufactuing), most firms reported using from one to three chemicals,with styrene the most prevalent; however, in rubber manufacturing (SICs301 to 306), almost half of the firms reported using 6 to 10 chemicals.Most employee exposures in small firms are intermittent and short-term(up to 30 minutes), and there are very few exposures for 4 hours or more.In large firms, by contrast, the majority of chemical exposures are for4 to 8 hours a day. In this SIC, most small fiial rubber. Commenters statedthat a small number of the facilities in this sector, i.e., those usingstyrene resins in open-mold processes, would encounter technological problemsin attempting to comply with the proposed styrene limits [Ex. 3-742, pp.34-36; Tr. 8/3/88, p. 5-95]. This issue is addressed in Chapter F_TechnologicalFeasibility.Open-mold processes were described by these commenters as operations inwhich the styrene resin is applied directly to the surface of a mold (generallyby means of a spray gun) and is then rolled by hand to build up successivelayers of reinforced plastic.

TheCultured Marble Institute characterized the typical open-mold-process firmin this sector as a company that employs 17 persons and has annual salesof less than $1 million. The issues of technological feasibility that pertainto users of this process in SIC 30 are discussed in detail in the TechnologicalFeasibility chapter, below.In this SIC, over 60 percent of the firms identified by the survey weresmall firms (firms having fewer than 20 production workers.) In the smallfirms, maintenance work is most commonly performed by production workers,although about one-quarter of small firms use outside contractors for maintenancework, and one in seven has a dedicated maintenance staff. Over two-thirdsof large firms have dedicated maintenance staff; the remaining large firmsuse production workers for maintenance more often than they use outsidecontractors.Most firms reported using from one to four processes. In SIC 307 (miscellaneousplastics manufactuing), most firms reported using from one to three chemicals,with styrene the most prevalent; however, in rubber manufacturing (SICs301 to 306), almost half of the firms reported using 6 to 10 chemicals.Most employee exposures in small firms are intermittent and short-term(up to 30 minutes), and there are very few exposures for 4 hours or more.In large firms, by contrast, the majority of chemical exposures are for4 to 8 hours a day. In this SIC, most small firms have internal exposurestandards; the majority of these reported using ACGIH TLVs. Large firmsmost commonly use OSHA PELs, but many use ACGIH TLVs or have no internalexposure standards. Air monitoring data were provided for about 40 percentof large firms and for approximately 13 percent of small firms.The survey found that about 37 percent of the processes are totally enclosed,and that very few processes are located outdoors. In one-third of the firmswith chemical exposures, production workers use respirators.Survey respondents identified the presence of 75 different substances inSIC 30. Ethylene glycol was estimated to occur the most frequently at atotal of 1,889 processes, including assembly, blending/mixing/formulating,calendaring/winding and coating/spraying. Methyl chloroform was estimatedto occur in 1,852 processes including blending/mixing/formulating, coating/spraying,and cutting/sawing/planing.SIC 31_Leather and Leather ProductsThe leather and leather products industry (SIC 31) consists of severalsectors such as leather tanning (SIC 311), boot and shoe cut stock (SIC313), non-rubber footwear (SIC 314), and luggage and leather goods (SICs315-319), [1, pp. 133-135]. Shipments of leather products increased in1987, while employment in the leather industry has been declining steadilyover the past several years [3, p. 46-1].Data on the number of establishments and employment for 1985 are shownin Table C-1. In 1985, there were approximately 3,940 establishments engagedin the production of leather and leather products. Over 64 percent of theseestablishments employed fewer than 20 workers. The largest employer isthe non-rubber footwear industry, with 58 percent of the workforce in 1986.Production workers make up 84 percent of the total workforce in SIC 31.According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the 1986 value of shipmentsfor leather and leather products ($7.8 billion) was down 8.8 percent from1985. The total represents 0.4 percent of the value of shipments for allmanufacturing industries. Non-rubber footwear (SIC 314) makes up most ofthe value of shipments in this industry, with 51 percent of the total value[2]. The median return on assets in 1985 for the leather and leather productindustry was 6.3 percent [6].The number of establishments in the leather tanning and finishing industry(SIC 311) has decreased by over 248 establishments, from 384 establishmentsin 1982 to 136 establishments in 1987. Employment has also decreased significantlywhile shipments increased to $2.0 billion in 1987 from $1.7 billion in1986. Since the leather tanning industry is highly dependent on the demandfrom the non-rubber footwear industry, it is not likely that the situationwill improve in the near future [3, pp. 46-1 and 46-2].The non-rubber footwear industry (SIC 314) had a small increase in thevalue of shipments in 1987 ($4.1 billion), while total employment and thenumber of production workers declined 3.0 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.This industry has suffered substantially since 1981 when an import restraintagreement with South Korea and Taiwan expired. Since then, import's shareof the domestic market has increased to over 81 percent in 1987, to anestimated 226 million pairs [3, pp. 46-5 to 46-10]. The miscellaneous luggage and leather goods industry (SICs 315-319) sawimprovements in production, employment, and shipments in 1987, reversinga past trend. Shipments were expected to increase 3.9 percent in 1987 to$1.9 billion. The estimated number of production workers also increasedin 1987, to 27,200 employees from 27,000 employees in 1986. Imports reachedover 52 percent of the domestic market in 1986 [3, pp. 46-10 to 46-14].In this SIC, the survey identified almost twice as many small firms (fewerthan 20 production workers) as large firms. In the small firms, a largeshare of maintenance work is performed by production workers, althoughone-fifth of the firms use outside contractors and one-fifth of the firmsemploy maintenance staffs. Large firms have a dedicated maintenance staffthat performs most of the maintenance work, while production workers andoutside contractors do the rest of the maintenance work. The manufacturers classified in this SIC usually have one to three basicprocesses, with potential exposure to seven to eight chemicals. Employeesare exposed to these chemicals on an intermitten short term basis (up to30 minutes) or continuously (up to 8 hours per day) with large firms tendingto have more long-term exposures. Small firms generally have no internalexposure standards. Around one-half of large firms reported using the OSHAPELs; the balance indicated that they have no standards. Air monitoringdata was being done at about one-half of the processes found in large plants.The survey found that over forty percent of the processes are totally enclosedand less than one percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilationis used most frequently to control exposures at processes not enclosedor outdoors. In one-tenth of the firms with chemical exposures, productionworkers use respirators, with a higher percentage of large firms usingrespirators than small firms. The combined data on exposure levels andmethods of exposure control indicate that overexposure is not occurringat many processes in this SIC. Survey respondents identified the presence of 42 different substances inSIC 31. N-hexane was estimated to occur the most frequently at a totalof 426 processes, primarily gluing/hot pressing. Toluene was estimatedto occur at a total of 319 processes including cleaning, coating/spraying,gluing/hot pressing, and stamping/shaping. SIC 32_Stone, Clay, and Glass Products This industry is made up of products such as cement (SIC 324), concrete(SIC 327), pottery (SIC 326), stone (SIC 328), glass (SICs 321-323), andstructural clay products (SIC 325). Since these products are primarilyused as construction materials, the industry is heavily dependent on theamount of new construction activity in a given year. There were 21,054 establishments in the stone, clay and glass industry(SIC 32) in 1985. Most of these firms (73.7 percent) employed fewer than20 workers in 1985. The mean establishment size was 28 employees. Totalemployment was 514,000 in 1986, a decrease of 1.1 percent over the 1985total employment figure of 520,000 [7]. Production employment also declinedfrom 1985 to 1986. In 1986, the value of shipments in SIC 32 ($57.3 billion) increased 3.9percent over the 1985 figure. The total value was 2.5 percent of the valueof shipments for all manufacturing industries. The value of shipments isevenly distributed over the entire industry, except for the concrete sector(SIC 327) with 36.4 percent of shipment [2]. The median rate of returnon assets for SIC 32 was 6.5 percent in 1985 [6]. The concrete industry (SIC 327) experienced a small decline in shipmentsin 1987 after considerable improvement in production, employment, and demandover the past years. The demand for concrete has increased substantiallysince 1982, when shipments were 23 percent below their current figure.Future demand for concrete depends mainly on non-residential building constructionactivity [3, pp. 2-7 to 2-8].The cement industry (SIC 324) experienced a decline in the value of shipments,from $4.1 billion in 1986 to $3.9 billion in 1987, a decrease of 3.3 percent.Consumption of cement also declined in 1987 by 1 percent, the first annualdecline since 1982. However, industry shipments were more than 26 percenthigher than the 1982 low point of 65 million tons. Total employment was19,500 in 1987. Production employment (14,500 employees in 1987) representedapproximately 74 percent of the workforce [3, pp. 2-4 to 2-6]. The glass industry (SICs 321-323) has experienced steady growth over thepast two years, mainly in production and shipments. The value of shipmentsfor the glass industry increased from $13.9 billion in 1985 to $14.6 billionin 1986. New product introductions have allowed the glass industry to makesubstantial gains in winning market share. Total employment and productionemployment declined for the glass industry (SICs 321-323) in 1986, butSIC 323 (products of purchased glass) did have increased in both totalemployment and production employment. The outlook for continued growthfor the glass industry is good [3, pp. 2-9 to 2-12]. Shipments of structural clay products and pottery (SICs 325-326) have increasedsubstantially over the past few years, from 5.1 billion bricks in 1982to 7.4 billion bricks in 1986. The 1986 value of shipments for SICs 325-326was $4.9 billion, an increase of 4.3 percent from 1985. The outlook forthe industry is for slow growth in the near future [3, pp. 2-12 to 2-13].The stone industry (SIC 328) had an increase of 1.3 percent in the valueof shipments in 1986. Total employment and production employment stayedvirtually the same [2]. In SIC 32, the survey identified over three times as many small firms (fewerthan 20 production workers) as large firms. In the small firms, over three-fourthsof maintenance work is performed by production workers, although some firmsto employ a maintenance staff. Large firms use a dedicated maintenancestaff for approximately two-thirds of the maintenance work, while one-fourthuse production workers. The remainder of firms use outside contractors.The manufacturers classified in this SIC usually have one to three basicprocesses, with potential exposures to as many as eight chemicals. Employeesare exposed to these chemicals on an intermittent short term basis (upto 30 minutes) or continuously (up to 8 hours per day), with large firmstending to have more long-term exposures. Small firms generally have nointernal exposure standards; when they do, the OSHA PELs are followed aboutseventy percent of the time. Approximately one-half of large firms reportedusing the OSHA PELs; the balance indicated that they have no standardsor they rely on ACGIH TLVs. Air monitoring data were provided for overone-half of the processes found in large plants.The survey found that about one-third of the processes are totally enclosedand around one-fifth are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilation andrespirators are used most frequently to control exposures at processesnot enclosed or outdoors. In almost one-half of the firms with chemicalexposures, production workers use respirators, with a higher percentageof large firms using respirators than small firms. The combined data onexposure level and methods of exposure control indicate that overexposureis not occurring at many processes in this industry.Survey respondents in this SIC identified blending/mixing/formulating,chipping/grinding, drilling/cutting/flame-jet lancing, polishing (surface)grinding, cutting/sawing/planing, casting, batch making, and bonding asthe processes used most often. Chemicals that were present in these processesincluded: acetone, ammonia, calcium oxide, furfuryl alcohol, graphite,magnesium oxide fume, and silica. The National Lime Association commentedon the presence of calcium hydroxide and calcium oxide in this industry[Ex. 3-890].SIC 33-Primary Metal IndustriesThe primary metal industry (SIC 33) is divided into two different sectors:nonferrous metals and foundries (SICs 333-336) and ferrous metals and foundries(SICs 331-332) [1, pp. 145-152]. This includes the basic iron and steelindustry, and the metals industry. Both sectors have been hurt in the recentpast by a decline in domestic consumption and the growing number of importsinto the United States. The future for these industries, however, looksbrighter due to an increase in orders, slowing imports, and a decreasein capacity [10]. These industries have had increases in prices, shipments,and profits in 1987 and 1988, helped by the fall in the value of the dollar.As seen in Table C-1, the number of establishments in SIC 33 in 1985 totaled10,101. The majority of these firms (55.3 percent) had fewer than 20 employeesin 1985. Total employment (808,000 employees in 1985) and production employment(612,000 in 1985) have declined over the last several years, while theaverage hourly wage of production workers ($12.76 in 1986) has increasedby 1.5 percent from 1985 to 1986 [7]. The mean establishment size was 80employees in 1985. However, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute(AISI), integrated steel mills are typically much larger, averaging 825workers [Ex. 3-1123, p. 14].Production in the steel mill products industry has declined over the pastfew years, from 92.5 million tons in 1984 to 83.0 million tons in 1987,a decline of 10.3 percent [3, p. 20-1]. The 1986 value of shipments ($105.6billion) in SIC 33 was 4.7 percent of the value of shipments for all manufacturingindustries [2]. The median rate of return on assets in 1985 was 5.5 percentfor the primary metal industry [6].In 1987, the industry had its first profitable year since 1982. The industryhas cut costs of production while prices have remained steady. In 1988,the industry experienced additional improvement; production was up 15 percentand shipments up 12 percent. Prices and profits rose considerably duringthe year, and the outlook for 1989 is good [11].The import situation has also improved for the domestic steel industry,due in part to the falling value of the dollar against major competitorssuch as Japan and Europe. Imports have been declining since their peakof 26.2 million tons in 1984. Imports as a percent of domestic consumptionfell to 22 percent in 1987, down from a peak of 26.4 percent in 1984. Exportsreached 1.1 million tons in 1987 [3, pp. 20-1 to 20-9]. Exports during1988 rose about 50 percent over the previous year.The ferrous castings industry (SIC 332) has shown a poor performance overthe past few years, but is starting to improve. The value of shipmentsfor SIC 332 has increased, from $10.3 billion in 1986 to $10.8 billionin 1987. The value of shipments for SIC 332 is forecast to increase 5.2percent in 1988, although this trend is not likely to continue in the future.Total employment and the number of production workers have also begun toincrease, by 2.3 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, from 1986 to 1987[3, pp. 20-6 to 20-7].Primary nonferrous metals can be classified in four categories: aluminum,zinc, lead, and copper. Aluminum industry shipments have increased steadilyin the past few years, with an 11.3 percent increase in 1987. Shipmentsare projected to continue rising through 1992 [3, pp. 21-8 to 21-11]. Pricesduring the last several years have continued to increase, from 53andCx.11;/poundin the last quarter of 1986 to 83andCx.11;/pound at the end of 1987 and $1.12/poundby the end of 1988 [12, 13].The zinc industry should have steady growth over the next few years, duemainly to an increase in consumption. The price of zinc has risen from38andCx.11;/pound in 1986 to 42.5andCx.11;/pound in 1987. Domestic consumptionincreased to 1.014 million metric tons in 1987. The value of shipmentsincreased by 1.4 percent in 1987, and is expected to increase by another1.6 percent in 1988. Total employment and the number of production workershas remained steady for the past several years [3, pp. 21-14 to 21-16].Consumption of primary lead products increased slightly over 3 percentin 1987-88 owing to increases in the replacement battery market. Automotiveproducts account for about 70 percent of all demand for lead. Changes inrecycling patterns due to EPA RCRA regulations may increase demand forprimary lead in the near future. The market in general has been growingat a steady 1 percent per year [3, pp. 21-6 to 21-8 and 14]. Prices haverisen in recent months to 42andCx.11;/pound [12] from 36.9andCx.11; in 1987.ASARCO, one of two primary lead producers in the U.S., is considering adoptingLondon Metal Exchange prices in lieu of its own pricing [4].The copper industry has been undergoing restructuring to remain competitivein the world market. Currently, there are seven operating copper smelters,compared to fourteen in 1970. This restructuring has forced the industryto decrease capacity and reduce employment [3, pp. 21-11 to 21-14]. Theprice of copper has increased from 66.1andCx.11;/pound in 1986 to 75.0andCx.11;/poundin 1987 due to a decline in inventories [3, pp. 21-11 to 21-14]. Current1988 cash prices for copper have risen to $1.64/pound [12]. The Peruviancopper fields are estimated to need an additional 30 days to return tofull production following the recent 54 day strike by miners [15] Thisshould allow the industry to turn a profit for the first time in severalyears. The copper smelting industry is likely to be impacted by the proposedrevision to the PEL for sulfur dioxide.In SIC 33, the survey identified slightly more small firms (fewer than20 production workers) than large firms. Maintenance work in the smallfirm is done primarily by production workers although some firms use adedicated maintenance staff. Large firms generally have maintenance workperformed by the maintenance staff, with the remainder of firms using productionworkers and outside contractors.The manufacturers classified in this SIC who reported chemical or processuse usually have one to four basic processes, with potential exposure toone to four chemicals. Employees are exposed to these chemicals on an intermittentshort term basis (up to 30 minutes) or continuously (up to 8 hours perday), with large firms tending to have more long-term exposures. Smallfirms generally have some internal exposure standards; when they do, theOSHA PELs are followed about three-fourths of the time. Over one-half oflarge firms reported using the OSHA PELs; the balance indicated that theyhave no standards or they rely on ACGIH TLVs. Air monitoring data wereprovided for approximately two-thirds of the processes found in large plants.The survey found that about one-fourth of the processes are totally enclosedand less than 3 percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilationand respirators are used most frequently to control exposures at processesnot enclosed or outdoors. In almost one-half of the firms with chemicalexposures, production workers use respirators, with a higher percentageof large firms using respirators than small firms. The combined data onexposure levels and methods of exposure control indicate that overexposuremay occur at less than one-tenth of processes in small firms and at aboutone-fifth of the process in large firms.Survey respondents in SIC 33 identified metal melting/pouring/casting asthe process most frequently used, with exposure to aluminum metals, carbonmonoxide, and copper fume reported most frequently. The American Cast MetalsAssociation confirmed the presence of most of the chemicals surveyed [Exs.3-673 and 3-675]. The American Iron and Steel Institute also commentedon several of the chemicals identified in the survey [See, for example,Ex. 3-1123].SIC 34_Fabricated Metal ProductsThe fabricated metal products industry (SIC 34) can be broken down intonine categories: metal cans and shipping containers (SIC 341); cutleryand hand tools (SIC 342); heating equipment (SIC 343); fabricated structuralmetal products (SIC 344); screw machine products, bolts, and washers (SIC345); forgings and stampings (SIC 346); plating and coating (SIC 347);small arms and ordnance (SIC 348); and miscellaneous wire and fabricatedproducts (SIC 349). SIC 34 excludes machinery and transportation equipment[1, pp. 153-166].The total number of establishments in the fabricated metal products industryin 1985 was 46,322. The majority of these firms (67.0 percent) have fewerthan 20 employees, a change of 0.2 percent since 1984. Total employmentin this industry has reached 1.5 million employees, an increase of 0.1percent since 1984 [7].The 1986 value of shipments for SIC 34 ($138.0 billion) represents a 1.1percent decrease over 1985. This was 6.1 percent of the value of shipmentsfor all manufacturing industries [2]. The median return on assets for thefabricated metal products industry in 1985 was 7.1 percent [2].Metal can (SIC 3411) shipments have been increasing steadily in the pastfew years, from 104.7 billion units in 1986 to 109.3 billion units in 1987,an increase of over 4.4 percent. This was due mainly to the increase insoft drink and beer cans being shipped. The value of shipments has alsoincreased, with a compound annual increase of 2.9 percent from 1980 to1985. Total employment in the metal cans industry has remained steady,with a slight increase expected in 1987. The number of production workershas increased slightly, with an increase of 0.3 percent from 1986 to 1987.Exports of metal cans have decreased substantially since 1984 when theyreached an all-time high of $56.5 million. Since that time they have decreasedto $36.2 million in 1987 [3, pp. 7-1 to 7.4].The fabricated structural metal industry (SIC 3441) produces structuralmetal components used primarily in the construction industry. Shipmentsof fabricated structural metal decreased slightly, from $9.0 billion in1986 to $8.9 billion in 1987. Total employment decreased slightly in 1987[3, pp. 2-3 to 2-5].The value of shipments in the screw machine products, bolts, and washersindustry (SIC 345) decreased slightly from 1986 to 1987, from $7.8 billionto $7.9 billion. Total employment increased from 94,000 in 1986 to 94,400in 1987. Since the automotive industry is the major customer for this industry,stable automotive sales are the key to economic health for this industrysector [3, pp. 26-1 to 26-6].In SIC 34, the survey identified over twice as many small firms (fewerthan 20 production workers) as large firms. In the small firms, about one-halfof the firms have maintenance work performed by production workers, theremaining firms using maintenance workers or outside contractors. Largefirms generally employ a maintenance staff to do the majority of maintenancework, although some firms use production workers and outside contractors.The manufacturers classified in this SIC usually have one to three basicprocesses, with potential exposure to one to four chemicals. Employeesare exposed to these chemicals on an intermittent short term basis (upto 30 minutes) or continuously (up to 8 hours per day) with large firmstending to have more long-term exposures. Small firms generally have nointernal exposure standards; when they do, the OSHA PELs are followed aboutone-half of the time. Over one-half of large firms reported using the OSHAPELs; the balance indicated that they have no standards or they rely onACGIH TLVs. Air monitoring data were provided for about one-half of theprocesses found in large plants.The survey found that about one-fourth of the processes are totally enclosedand around one-fifth are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilation andrespirators are used most frequently to control exposures at processesnot enclosed or outdoors. In over one-half of the firms with chemical exposures,production workers use respirators, with a higher percentage of large firmsusing respirators than small firms. The combined data on exposure levelsand methods of exposure control indicate that overexposure is not occurringat any processes in small firms and at less than one-tenth of the processesin large firms. Survey respondents in this SIC identified casting/painting, welding/soldering,polishing (surface)/grinding, and degreasing, as the processes most frequentlyused. Welding fumes, iron oxide, and isopropyl alcohol were the chemicalsidentified most often in the survey. OSHA has retained the existing limitfor iron oxide. No comments were received relative to processes and chemicalsin this SIC. SIC 35_Non-Electrical Machinery The non-electrical machinery industry (SIC 35) is made up of several differentsectors: engines and turbines (SIC 351); farm and garden machinery (SIC352); construction and related machinery (SIC 353); metal working machinery(SIC 354); special industry machinery (SIC 355); general industrial machinery(SIC 356); computer and office equipment (SIC 357); refrigeration and serviceindustry machinery (SIC 358); and miscellaneous machinery and equipment(SIC 359) [1, pp. 167-183]. As seen in Table C-1, the number of establishments in 1985 totaled 77,748.The majority of these (77.1 percent) had fewer than 20 employees in 1985.Total employment and production employment have decreased over the lastseveral years. The 1986 value of shipment ($208.5 billion) in SIC 35 was9.2 percent of the value of shipments for all manufacturing industries[2]. In 1985, the median rate of return on assets for SIC 35 was 7.5 percent[6]. The 1986 value of shipments for engines and turbines (SIC 351) was $14.1billion, a decrease of 5.5 percent of the 1985 value of shipments ($14.9billion). Both total employment and production employment decreased from1985 to 1986, by 8.8 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively. Major expansionsof electrical power generation capacity and hence, turbine manufacturehave been curtailed in recent years as cogeneration facilities are nowproviding additional power. Smaller units for these same cogeneration faciltieshave provided some additional sales [6]. The largest sector of SIC 351is internal combustion engines, n.e.c., with 77 percent of the value ofshipments in 1986. The farm and garden machinery industry has experienced some improvementin 1987. While the value of shipments for lawn and garden equipment increasedin 1987, the value of shipments for farm machinery and equipment ($7.0billion) declined to their lowest level since 1973. Total employment, whichexceeded 125,000 in 1981, dropped to around 67,000 in 1987. Productionemployment, which makes up approximately two-thirds of the work force,has also been declining since 1979. The prospects for lawn and garden equipmentappear much better, with steady increases in the value of shipments since1981. The 1987 value of shipments for lawn and garden equipment ($3.7 billion)was 4.2 percent greater than the 1986 value of shipments ($3.5 billion)[2]. This industry had a compound annual increase of 8.9 percent from 1980to 1985 in value of shipments. Total employment and production employmenthave remained fairly steady, with compound annual increases of 1.9 percentand 3.8 percent, respectively [3, pp. 25-1 to 25-3]. The construction and related machinery industry (SIC 353) has experienceda decline in recent years. The value of shipments for SIC 353 declinedby 6.2 percent, from $27.7 billion in 1985 to $25.9 billion in 1986. Bothtotal employment and production employment fell from 1985 to 1986, by 8.7percent and 11.7 percent, respectively [2]. The decline of the dollar valueof shipments must be viewed against a background of reorganization andprice cutting by American manufacturers resulting in leaner, more efficientorganizations that can make a profit at lower levels of sales. Significantmarket share has been regained [17]. Construction machinery makes up thelargest share of this industry, with approximately half of the total valueof shipments. The machine tool industry has had a major improvement in orders, and profitsduring 1988. ``Orders for all of 1988 climbed to about $3.5 billion, up66% from the $2.1 billion range for both 1986 and 1987'' [18]. The 1986value of shipments for metal working machinery (SIC 354) was $20.5 billion,an increase of 3.2 percent over 1985. Although shipments increased in thisindustry in 1986, both total employment and production employment fellduring the same time period [2]. This is a reflection of the downsizingand modernizing that has been undertaken in this industry. In the future,moderate sales improvements showed a positive impact on earnings [19].The largest sector within the metal-working industry is special dies, tools,jigs, and fixtures, with 38 percent of the value of shipments and 43 percentof the total workforce. Special industry machinery (SIC 355) has experienced stable growth in thepast, and this trend is likely to continue into the future. Industry shipmentsincreased approximately one percent, from $14.8 billion in 1985 to $14.9billion in 1986. Special industry machinery, n.e.c. (SIC 3559) is the largestsector within this industry, with 41.9 percent of the total value of shipmentsin 1986. Both total employment and production employment have been falling,by 5.0 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively, from 1985 to 1986. Productionemployees make up approximately 57.0 percent of the total workforce. The 1986 value of shipments for general industrial machiney, SIC 356, ($24.8billion) fell from the 1985 value of shipments ($25.3 billion) by an estimated2.4 percent. Employment and industry shipments are divided fairly evenlyover the entire industry, with pumps and pumping equipment (SIC 3561) andgeneral industrial machinery, n.e.c. (SIC 3569) being the largest sectors.Total employment declined by 4.1 percent, while the number of productionworkers fell by 5.8 percent [4]. The computer industry (SIC 357) has had stable demand for its productsin the U.S. market during 1986 and 1987. The value of shipments of officeand computing machines (SIC 357) decreased from $62.2 billion in 1985 to$58.8 billion in 1986, a decline of 5.5 percent reflecting strong pricecompetition. Electronic computing equipment (SIC 3573) is the largest segment,with 89 percent of the value of shipments. Total employment and the numberof production workers have declined since 1985 by 10.8 percent and 12.7percent, respectively. Imported computer equipment has made significantinroads into the domestic market, due mainly to the standardization ofproducts and the fall in the price of computer equipment [3, pp. 30-1 to30-11]. The dollar value of 1988 shipments is ahead of 1987 shipments [20]. The refrigeration and service machinery industry (SIC 358) had an annualrate of growth of 0.9 percent from 1985 to 1986, attributable to the increasein new residential construction. While total employment and the numberof production workers have increased, imports have also been steadily increasing[3, pp. 22-9 to 22-11]. It appears that the general industrial machinery industry (SIC 35) couldbe affected by several of the proposed revisions. The following substancesare used or generated by this industry: carbon dioxide, chlorine, chromiummetal, fibrous glass dust, furfuryl alcohol, iron oxide, manganese fumes,nitrogen dioxide, oil mist, sulfur dioxide, 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluorethane,triethylamine, tungsten, welding fumes, wood dust and asphalt fumes. Themajority of comments from the general industrial machinery industry dealwith the appropriateness of the PELs rather than technical or economicfeasibility. The Association of Reproduction Materials Manufacturers (ARMM) commentedon their opposition to the proposed revision for ammonia based on healtheffects and the inappropriateness of adopting ACGIH standards. ARMM isa trade group with 47 company members who supply materials and equipmentto over 5,000 commerical blueprinters [Ex. 8-29]. The International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration opposed the proposedstandard for ammonia based on health effects and economic feasibility.In the final rule, only a STEL of 35 ppm has been set for this substance.In this SIC, the survey identified over four times as many small firms(fewer than 20 production workers) as large firms. In the small firms,maintenance work is performed in large part by production workers, althoughsome firms employ dedicated maintenance staffs or use outside contractors.Large firms have the majority of maintenance work performed by a dedicatedmaintenance staff, with some use of production workers or outside contractors.The manufacturers classified in this SIC usually have from one to fourbasic processes, with potential exposure to one to four chemicals. Employeesin SIC 35 are exposed to these chemicals for varying amounts of time fromintermittent short term periods (up to 30 minutes) to continuously (upto 8 hours per day), with small firms having more intermittent short termexposures and large firms tending to have more long-term exposures. Smallfirms generally have no internal exposure standards; when they do, theOSHA PELs are followed about one-third of the time. Over one-half of largefirms reported using the OSHA PELs; the balance indicated that they haveno standards or they rely on ACGIH TLVs. Air monitoring data were providedfor about one-half of the processes found in large plants. The survey found that about one-fifth of the processes are totally enclosedand 5 percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilation, generaldilution ventilation and respirators are used most frequently to controlexposures at processes not enclosed or outdoors. In over one-half of thefirms with chemical exposures, production workers use respirators, withlarge firms and small firms using respirators at about the same rate. Survey respondents in this SIC identified polishing (surface)/grinding,coating/painting, and soldering as the processes which occur most frequently.Chemicals that were present most often were welding fumes, oil mist, andstoddard solvent. Comments from Caterpillar Incorporated and John Deereand Co. confirmed the presence of several of the survey chemicals in SIC35 such as chromium metal, iron oxide, oil mist, welding fumes, and 1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluorethane(Ex. 3-349]. In the final rule, OSHA has not revised the existing limitsfor chromium metal, iron oxide and oil mist.SIC 36_Electric and Electronic Equipment This industry is made up of several distinct sectors: electric distributingequipment (SIC 361); electrical industrial apparatus (SIC 362; householdappliances (SIC 363); electrical lighting and wiring equipment (SIC 364);radio and TV receiving equipment and communication equipment (SIC 365-366);electronic components and accessories (SIC 367); and miscellaneous electronicequipment (SIC 369) [1, pp. 194-195]. In 1985, the electric and electronic equipment industry employed about2.2 million workers. The majority of the firms had fewer than 20 employees.The value of shipments for all electric and electronic equipment establishmentsin 1986 was $196.2 billion. This was 8.7 percent of the value of shipmentsfor all manufacturing industries. Most of the value of shipments in SIC36 is from the communication equipment sector ($67.4 billion or 34.4 percent)[2]. The median return on assets for the electric and electronic equipmentindustry was 7.9 percent in 1985 [6]. The electric distributing equipment industry (SIC 361) had mixed performanceduring 1987. While the value of shipments increased for switchgear by 0.5percent, the value of shipments for transformers decreased by 6.6 percentfrom 1986 to 1987. Total employment and the number of production workershas remained fairly steady since the early 1980's [3, p. 28-4]. Motors and industrial controls (SIC 362) have had stable sales during thelast several years. Future growth is dependent upon the economy in generaland construction growth for any sizable increases in sales. Motors havesignificant import pressure; several domestic manufacturers have manufacturingfacilities in Mexico. Industrial controls are expected to grow by 2.5 percent[3, pp. 28-1 to 28-3].The household appliance industry (SIC 363) has had a steady increase inshipments since the early 1980's, from $16.8 billion in 1986 to $17.7 billionin 1987, an increase of 5.7 percent. The industry is optimistic about itsfuture, due mainly to increased residential construction and an anticipatedincrease in disposable income. Imports have not been a substantial factorin this industry (exports have not increased either). Total employmentand the number of production workers declined from 1980 to 1985 by 4.4percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. This decline in employment is dueto the recent number of acquisitions within the industry and the need tocut costs of production. In 1987, total employment and production employmentincreased slightly [3, pp. 47-8 to 47-11].The value of shipments for the electrical lighting and wiring industry(SIC 364) has been increasing steadily over the last decade, from 11,321in 1980 to 15,806 in 1985, an increase of 39.6 percent. However, totalemployment and the number of production workers have decreased slightly.Performance in this industry is related, in part, to activity in the constructionindustry. Since the electrical lighting and wiring industry depends onboth residential and non-residential construction, it is able to withstanda slowdown in one sector as long as the other sector is still active [3,pp. 4-1 to 4-4].The consumer electronics and communication equipment industry (SICs 365-366)has had mixed performance in the past. The communication equipment industryhas performed well, while the consumer electronics industry has not performedas well, due to import competition. Overall, the value of industry shipmentshas remained fairly stable, with shipments increasing in the communicationequipment industry and shipments decreasing in the consumer electronicindustry. Total employment and the number of production workers also followthis pattern, decreasing for consumer electronics and increasing for communication[3, pp. 31-1 to 31-8 and 32-1 to 32-6 and 47-7].The electronic components and accessories industry (SIC 367) is expectedto show record growth over the next few years. Industry shipments wereup 8.3 percent, from $43.9 billion in 1986 to $47.5 billion in 1987. Thiswas due, in part, to the strong performance of the defense electronicsindustry. The number of production workers and total employment have remainedfairly steady in 1986 and 1987. Imports are still increasing, but may beslowed due to the fall in the value of the dollar [2, pp. 32-1 to 32-4].In SIC 36, the survey estimated that almost 70 percent of the firms aresmall firms (fewer than 20 production workers). Maintenance work is usuallyperformed by production workers in the small firms and a dedicated maintenancestaff for the large firms.The manufacturers classified in this SIC usually have one to three processes,with potential exposure to one to six chemicals. Employees are exposedto these chemicals on an intermittent short term basis (up to 30 minutes)or continuously (up to 8 hours per day), with large firms tending to havemore long-term exposures. Small firms generally have no internal exposurestandards; when they do, the OSHA PELs are followed three-fourths of thetime. Almost two-thirds of large firms reported using the OSHA PELs; thebalance indicated that they use the ACGIH TLVs most frequently. Air monitoringdata were provided for almost one-half of the processes found in largeplants.The survey found that less than one-fifth of the processes were totallyenclosed and less than one percent located outdoors. General dilution andlocal exhaust ventilation are used about equally to control exposures atprocesses not enclosed or outdoors. In about one-quarter of the firms withchemical exposures, production workers use respirators, with a higher percentageof large firms using respirators than small firms. The combined data onexposure levels and methods of exposure indicate that overexposures mayoccur only in some processes in this industry.Survey respondents in this SIC identified coating/painting, polishing (surface)/grinding,processing, and degreasing as the processes which occur most frequently,and tin, stoddard solvent, and zinc oxide as the chemicals most frequentlyused. No comments addressed the processes or chemicals in this SIC.SIC 37_Transportation EquipmentThis industry sector includes establishments engaged in manufacturing equipmentfor land, sea, air, or space transportation and includes manufacturersof parts and accessories as well as complete vehicles.The major subdivisions within this sector are motor vehicles and motorvehicle equipment (SIC 371), aircraft and parts (SIC 372), ship and boatbuilding and repair (SIC 373), railroad equipment (SIC 374), motorcycles,bicycles and parts (SIC 375), guided missiles, space vehicles and parts(SIC 376), and miscellaneous transportation equipment (SIC 379). Establishmentsin the miscellaneous subdivision manufacture a broad range of products(e.g., from tanks to wheelbarrows) [1, pp. 196-201]. Because the manufactureof transportation equipment involves a wide range of industrial processes,establishments in this sector often include or involve foundries, electroplatingoperators, various types of hot metal work, welding, laminating, plasticmolding, and painting and coating. Workers may be exposed to many chemicalsused in these processes.Although the transportation equipment industry includes both very smalland very large establishments, it has an unusual number of very large establishmentsemploying thousands of employees. These very large establishments are mostlikely to be found in plants that produce final equipment on a mass-productionbasis (e.g., automobile plants, aircraft plants, tank assembly lines).However, as shown in Table C-1, 68 percent of all establishments have fewerthan 20 employees.The prosperity of the industry fluctuates with business cycles and withthe value of the dollar. Employment in this industry declined between 1981and 1982 but had recovered to the 1981 level by 1984 and had increasedanother 4 percent by 1985 [2].The record contains comments from businesses which use styrene in open-moldingprocesses to produce reinforced plastics products such as fiberglass boats,fiberglass car and truck bodies, and transportation equipment parts [Ex.3-742, pp. 34-36; Tr. 8/3/88, pp. 5-95, 5-119]. Commenters noted that controllingemployee exposures during the open molding of large components (e.g., boathulls and decks, recreational vehicles) is made costly and difficult bythe large sizes and bulky configurations of these products [Ex. 3-742,p. 48].The open-mold process in this sector is similar to that in other reinforcedplastics industries in that it involves the use of a styrene resin to makea mold, followed by the application of a fiberglass-styrene-catalyst mixturewith a spray or ``chopper'' gun, followed by manual rolling of the recentlyapplied surface. Workers bend over the mold to perform the layup operation,which requires rolling with a short- or long-handled roller. The roller,spray gun, and other tools used in this process all require repeated cleaningwith acetone in order to operate smoothly, and the workers themselves useacetone at frequent intervals to clean the styrene resin from their skin.The Styrene Information and Research Council (SIRC) estimates that thereare 625 reinforced plastic boatmakers in this sector that produce boatsunder 30 feet in length, and 125 facilities that manufacture larger boats[Ex. 3-742, p. 105]. These boatmakers are estimated to employ about 32,000production workers. However, SIRC estimates that no more than 20 percentof these employees engage in open molding or work in portions of thesefacilities where such molding in being done [Tr. 8/3/88, p. 5-100].Most boat builders are small firms, and many are family-owned enterpriseswith only one facility. Because the purchase of a recreational boat isa discretionary expense, the industry is relatively price-sensitive. Forexample, Jeff Napler, president of the National Marine Manufacturers Association,stated that the price elasticity of boat sales was approximately 2, i.e.,every 1-percent increase in price results in a 2-percent decline in sales[Tr. 8/3/88, pp. 5-168, 5-169]. The boat building industry is currentlyundergoing expansion and is enjoying relatively high profits [Tr. 8/10/88,pp. 10-144, 10-145]. Boat building is a labor-intensive industry, and firmsin this sector argue that automation is not an option, since many recreationalboats are custom designed [Tr. 8/10/88, pp. 10-144, 10-145].In this SIC, the survey identified twice as many small firms (fewer than20 production workers) as large firms. In the small firms, maintenancework is performed for the most part by production workers, although somefirms use outside contractors or have a dedicated maintenance staff. Largefirms divide maintenance work about equally between a dedicated maintenancestaff and production workers.The manufacturers classified in this SIC usually have two to four basicprocesses, with potential exposure to one to six chemicals being most common,though some firms report using up to ten chemicals. Employees are exposedto these chemicals on an intermittent short-term basis (up to 30 minutes)or continuously (up to 8 hours per day) with large firms tending to havemore long-term exposures. The majority of small firms use the OSHA PELs.Over 60 percent of large firms reported using the OSHA PELs; the balancehad no standards. Air monitoring data was being done for about one-halfof the processes found in large plants.The survey found that about 40 percent of the processes are totally enclosedand between 5 and 10 percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilationand respirators are used most frequently to control exposures at processesnot enclosed or outdoors. In over 70 percent of the firms with chemicalexposures, production workers use respirators, with a higher percentageof small firms using respirators than large firms. The combined data onexposure levels and methods of exposure control indicate that overexposuresmay occur at all processes in small firms and at about one-half of theprocesses in large firms.Survey respondents identified the presence of 68 different substances inSIC 37. Welding fumes was estimated to occur the most frequently at a totalof 3,508 processes, toluene at 3,191, and styrene at 2,541. Welding fumeswere identified in machining/grinding, welding/brazing, coating/spraying,and materials manufacture/fabrication. Toluene was identified in adhesivebinding, assembly, coating/spraying and cutting/sawing. Styrene was identifiedin injection molding, coating/spraying, sanding and assembly.SIC 38_Measuring, Analyzing and Controlling InstrumentsSIC 38 includes manufacturers of instruments used to measure, test, analyzeand control. It also includes optical instruments and lenses; surveyingand drafting instruments; hydrological, hydrographic, meteorological, andgeophysical equipment; search, detection, navigation, and guidance systemsand equipment; surgical, medical, and dental instruments, equipment, andsupplies; and watches and clocks [1, p. 243].The industries in this SIC rely heavily on research and development activities(Randamp;D) of other industries for sales of their products. According tothe U.S. Department of Commerce, increases in research and developmentexpenditures by industry and government in 1986 caused increases in salesof scientific and industrial instruments [2]. High tech firms, which representa large portion of SIC 38's product market, are the largest investors inresearch and development, where Randamp;D expenditures are measured as apercentage of gross sales. Firms producing semiconductors, computers andrelated equipment, office equipment, and software, among others, were majorsources of Randamp;D funds in 1986. The pharmaceutical and chemical industriesalso have relied on Randamp;D to a large extent. In addition, the declinein the price of oil, which raises profits by lowering production costs,is expected to further stimulate Randamp;D expenditures by the chemical industry[3, p. 33-1].Similarly, government outlays for Randamp;D increased in 1986 by more than9 percent in current dollars. Most of the Randamp;D expenditures, however,were for defense-related research. In addition, the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration (NASA) is expected to invest in new instrumentationfor the redesign of the space shuttle and other rocket systems [3, p. 33-4].According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the value of shipments in1985 ($61 billion) increased almost 26 percent since 1981 [2]. Between1981 and 1985, SIC 38 experienced a 1 percent loss in employment [3]. Ofall employees working in SIC 38, 54.4 percent were production workers [5].In 1985, the median rate of return on assets in this SIC was 7.3 percent[6].From 1981 to 1985, the value of shipments for SICs 383 and 384 experiencedgrowth, rising 60 and 54.3 percent, respectively. SIC 383 comprises 8 percentof the total value of shipments in SIC 38, while SIC 384 represents 23percent. In contrast, SIC 387 experienced a drop of 36 percent in the valueof shipments, representing only 1.5 percent of the total value of shipmentsin SIC 38 [6].In SIC 38, the survey identified nearly twice as many small firms (fewerthan 20 production workers) as large firms. In both small and large firms,maintenance work is performed predominantly by workers specifically employedto handle maintenance duties.The manufacturers classified in this SIC usually have two to six basicprocesses, with potential exposures to as many as six substances. Fourteenpercent of the processes involve exposure to these chemicals or substanceson a short-term basis (up to 30 minutes), with small firms tending to haveshorter-term exposures. Fifty percent of the firms in SIC 38 have reportedthe adoption of internal monitoring standards. Of those firms with standards,the most frequently reported were OSHA PELs. Employee monitoring had beenperformed at 32 percent of the processes. The survey found that about 49percent of the processes are totally enclosed and 10 percent of the processesare located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilation is used most frequentlyto control exposures at processes not enclosed. Nearly 45 percent of thefirms with chemical exposures have respirators for employee use, with ahigher percentage of small firms reporting the presence of respiratorsthan large firms. The combined data on exposure levels and methods of exposurecontrol indicate that many plants which are estimated to incur some costof compliance have overexposures in all processes at that plant.Survey respondents identified the presence of 30 different substances inSIC 38. Isopropyl alcohol was estimated to occur the most frequently ata total of 2,294 processes. Isopropyl alcohol was identified in blending/mixing/formulating,adhesive binding, recovery/reprocessing/reclamation, drying/baking, packaging/bagging,extrusion, loading/offloading/receiving/handling, reaction/fermentation,boilers, coating/spraying/finishing/layup, separation, and crushing/grinding/calcining.SIC 39_Miscellaneous Manufacturing IndustriesMiscellaneous industries included in SIC 39 reflect a diverse group ofproducers. Most of the industries in SIC 39 produce discretionary durableconsumer goods, some of which are luxury goods. Establishments that cannotbe grouped together at the three-digit level are included in SIC 399. Atthe three-digit level, miscellaneous manufacturing industries include producersof jewelry, silverware, and plated ware (SIC 391); musical instruments(SIC 393); toys and sporting goods (SIC 394); pens, pencils, office andart supplies (SIC 394); and costume jewelry and notions (SIC 396). A sixthcategory, miscellaneous manufactures (SIC 399), includes producers of broomsand brushes, signs and advertising displays, burial caskets, hard surfacefloor coverings, and manufacturing industries ``not elsewhere classified''[1, pp. 211-218].The number of establishments and employment in SIC 39 are shown in TableC-1. Nearly three-quarters (72 percent) of these employees are productionworkers.Establishments in SIC 39 are generally smaller than those in manufacturingas a whole, with higher proportions of employees concentrated in smallestablishments. The mean size of establishments is 11 employees, with 85percent of establishments having fewer than 20 employees, compared withless than 65 percent for manufacturing establishments as a whole. Relativelyfew establishments in SIC 39 have 100 or more employees [7].Miscellaneous manufactures (SIC 399) has the largest share (more than one-third)of the value of shipments for SIC 39 ($26.5 billion in 1985) [2, Vol. 1:8, 22, 24]. Substantial import competition, however, poses a threat tovarious subsectors. Imports account for nearly 60 percent of the new supplyof sporting and athletic goods and between one-quarter and three-eighthsof new supply in many other industries. The recent decline of the dollarhas tended to halt or reverse import penetration [3, pp. 45-2 to 45-11;46-10 to 46-13]; however, domestic production in SIC 39 will be affectedby the trend among doll and toy manufactures to move offshore [3, pp. 45-2to 45-11; 46-10 to 46-12].In terms of profitability, the majority of industries in SIC 39 are moreprofitable than most manufacturing industries. The median 1985 rate ofreturn on assets (8.0 percent) is the second highest median return on assetsof all two-digit manufacturing industries. Median rates of return for four-digitindustries within this sector range from 3.4 percent to 9.5 percent [6].In this SIC, the survey found that small firms (fewer than 20 productionworkers) comprise 85 percent of the total number of firms. In the smallfirms, maintenance work is performed for the most part by production workers,where large firms have a dedicated maintenance staff. The manufacturers classified in this SIC usually have two or three basicprocesses, with potential exposure to two chemicals. Employees in smallfirms are exposed to these chemicals about equally either on a short-termintermittent basis (up to 30 minutes) or continuously (up to 8 hours perday) with somewhat fewer employees exposed for periods between these twoextremes. Large firms have more long-term exposures. Small firms generallyeither have no internal exposure standards, or use the OSHA PELs, withsome using the ACGIH TLVs. About one-half of the large firms use the OSHAPELs; most of the balance indicated that they have no standards. Air monitoringdata were provided for one-fifth of the processes found in small firms,and over one-third in large firms.The survey found that about one-quarter of the processes are totally enclosedand 20 percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilation is usedmost frequently to control exposures at processes not enclosed or outdoors.In almost one-half of the firms with chemical exposures, production workersuse respirators, with a higher percentage of large firms using respiratorsthan small firms. The combined data on exposure levels and methods of exposurecontrol indicate that most firms will have no processes where overexposuresmay occur.Survey respondents in this SIC identified gluing/hot pressing, coating/spraying/finishing/layup,and cutting/sawing/planing as the processes most frequently used. Stoddardsolvent, toluene, particulates not otherwise regulated and styrene arethe substances encountered most often.The Casket Manufacturers Association of America (CMAA) [Ex. 8-78], representingfirms in SIC 3995, Burial Caskets, submitted information to the docketdescribing the manufacturing processes and material used by facilitiesin this four-digit sector. According to the CMAA, the primary materialsof construction of caskets are hardwood, metal, and cloth-covered board.Firms in the hardwood segment of this industry expressed concern that theproposed limit for hardwood of 1 mg/m\3\ would require the installationof controls and the imposition of compliance costs. (OSHA notes that thefinal rule's PEL for hardwood dust is 5 mg/m\3\.) The CMAA reports thatthere are about 20 companies that assemble hardwood caskets; two of thesefirms account for more than half of the total unit volume of production[Ex. 8-78]. Most firms in this segment have less than $5 million in annualsales, although larger firms have $15 million in sales annually [Ex. 8-78].According to Robert Morris Associates' financial data for SIC 3995, after-taxprofits in this sector are $7,900,000.No comments representing firms in SIC codes other than 3995 submitted industryprofile information to the docket; however, the sporting goods manufacturers(SIC 3949) submitted cost and feasibility data to OSHA, and these dataare discussed in the Technological Feasibility and Costs of Compliancechapters, below.SIC 40_Railroad TransportationSIC 40 includes establishments that provide line-haul railroad transportation,and switching and terminal establishments. General authority for the workingconditions at railroad operations is vested in the Federal Railroad Administration.For the most part, OSHA's standards apply only to off-track operationssuch as shops and servicing areas. The U.S. Department of Commerce estimatesthat in 1987, there were 23 individual Class I railroads (those with operatingrevenues of $88.5 million or more in 1986 dollars), which accounted forover 90 percent of the freight tonnage handled by the railroad industry[4]. The industry also includes about 480 smaller carriers, including shortlinesand switching and terminal companies. The 1987 operating revenue for therailroad industry was estimated at $26.5 billion, representing a gain of1.1 percent over 1986. Revenue ton-miles were estimated as 930 billion,which represents more than a 7 percent rate of growth [3, pp. 55-8]. Between1980 and 1985, the industries in SIC 40 experienced a serious economicdecline, as indicated by the fact that SIC 40 was the second slowest growingSIC (behind SIC 10, metal mining), and third highest in terms of employmentlosses behind SIC 33, primary metals and SIC 35, heavy machinery). Duringthis period, employment declined by approximately 27 percent [3, pp. 13-14].The median rate of return on assets in 1985 was 4.4 percent [6].In SIC 40, establishments generally employ dedicated maintenance workersor hire an outside firm to perform maintenance functions. The establishmentsin this SIC generally have one or two basic processes with potential exposureto two or three substances. Over 80 percent of the processes involve exposureto these chemicals or substances on an intermittent short-term basis (upto 30 minutes). Fifty percent of the establishments in SIC 40 have reportedthe adoption of an internal exposure standards. Among those establishmentswith internal standards, most use the ACGIH TLVs.The survey found that none of the interviewed establishments had totallyenclosed processes, but 85 percent were located outdoors. Of those establishmentswith ventilation systems, all were locally exhausted. None of the respondentsreported having respirators available in processes. The combined data onexposure levels and methods of exposure control indicate that many establishmentswhich are estimated to incur some cost of compliance have overexposuresin all processes at that establishment.Survey respondents identified the presence of 10 different substances inSIC 40. Methyl alcohol was estimated to occur the most frequently at atotal of 36 processes. Methyl alcohol was identified in maintenance activities.In addition, welding fumes occurred frequently in maintenance and weldingactivities.SIC 42_Motor Freight Transportation and WarehousingGrain elevators are classified in three different two-digit SIC codes:SIC 20, Food and Kindred Products; SIC 42, Motor Freight Transportationand Warehousing; and SIC 51, Wholesale Trade. Elevators falling withinSIC 42 are those whose primary income derives from the storage of grain.Rulemaking participants who commented on the feasibility of achieving OSHA'sproposed limit for grain dust in grain elevators did not designate SICcodes in their comments. The issue of grain dust exposure in grain elevatorsis discussed in connection with SIC 51, below. This SIC was not includedin the 1988 survey.SIC 45_Air TransportationThis SIC includes establishments that provide domestic and foreign transportationby aid and also those that operate airports and flying fields and provideterminal services. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), U.S. Departmentof Transportation, enforces rules and regulations governing the safetyand health of flight and cabin crew of aircraft in flight. In general,the FAA also has jurisdiction over airline maintenance and ground/supportpersonnel. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. airlineindustry consists of approximately 200 individual commercial air carriersoperating over 4,400 aircraft and employing over 435,000 people [3]. In1986, the industry served 418 million passengers and operated 7.4 billionfreight and express cargo ton-miles. Nine major carriers account for 90percent of all revenue passenger miles. (The U.S. Department of Commercedefines a major carrier as having annual revenues exceeding $1 billion,in 1982 dollars.) The remaining passenger revenue is shared by 16 carriersclassified as nationals (each with annual revenues between $75 millionand $1 billion in 1982 dollars), which account for about 12 percent, andby the regionals/commuters, which account for 4 percent. The U.S. Departmentof Commerce estimated the 1987 operating revenue for the airline industryas $55.6 billion, representing an annual growth rate of about 10 percent[3]. Revenue passenger miles were estimated as 435 billion, which representsa 3 perecent rate of growth [4, pp. 59-1]. In 1985, the median rate ofreturn on assets in this sector was 4.3 percent [6].In SIC 45, establishments generally employ dedicated maintenance workersto perform maintenance functions. The establishments in this SIC have upto five processes and as many as eight substances. Almost 60 percent ofthe processes involve potential exposure to these chemcials or substanceson an intermittent short-term basis (up to 30 minutes). Fifty percent ofthe establishments in SIC 45 have reported the adoption of internal exposurestandards. Among those establishments with internal standards, most useOSHA PELs.The survey found that one third of the interviewed establishments had totallyenclosed processes, but more than 65 percent were located outdoors. Ofthose establishments with ventilation systems, all were locally exhausted.More than 15 percent of the respondents reported having respirators foremployee use. The combined data on exposure levels and methods of exposurecontrol indicate that many establishments which are estimated to incursome cost of compliance have overexposures in all processes in the plant.Survey respondents in SIC 45 identified 10 different substances. Ethyleneglycol was estimated to occur the most frequently at 22 processes.SIC 47_Transportation ServicesSIC 47 includes establishments that furnish services related to transportation.Activities classified in SIC 47 include freight forwarding, arranging transportationfor passengers and freight, renting railroad cars, inspection and weighingservices; and freight car loading [1, pp. 280-281]. According to the U.S.Department of Commerce, between 1980 and 1985, SIC 47 was the third-fastestgrowing industry group, behind SIC 62 (Securities) and SIC 73 (BusinessServices) [3, pp. 13-14]. Between 1981 and 1985, SIC 47 experienced a 31percent increase in employment. Table C-1 presents employment and establishmentdata for SIC 47. The median return on assets in this SIC was 7.1 percent[6].In SIC 47, the survey identified more than eight times as many small firms(fewer than 20 production workers) as large firms. In the small firms maintenancework is predominantly performed by outside contractors. However in largefirms a high percentage of maintenance work is performed by productionworkers.The establishments classified in SIC 47 usually have one to four basicprocesses, with potential exposure to one to four substances. Ninety-fourpercent of the processes involve exposure to these chemicals or substanceson an intermittent short-term basis (up to 30 minutes). Fifty percent ofthe firms in this SIC reported the adoption of an internal exposure standard.Of those large firms with exposure standards, most rely on OSHA PELs. Amongsmall firms with exposure standards, most have adopted ACGIH TLVs. Internalmonitoring had been performed at 50 percent of the processes.The survey found that local exhaust ventilation is used most frequentlyto control exposures at processes not enclosed. Nearly 50 percent of theprocesses with chemical exposures have respirators for employee use, witha higher percentage of large firms reporting the presence of respiratorsthan small firms. The combined data on exposure levels and methods of exposurecontrol indicate that many establishments which are estimated to incursome cost of compliance have overexposures at all processes at that establishment.Survey respondents identified the presence of 5 different substances inSIC 47. Exposure to gasoline was estimated to occur most frequently ata total of 206 processes. Gasoline was identified in loading/offloading/receiving/handling.SIC 49_Electric, Gas and Sanitary ServicesSIC 49 includes establishments that generate, transmit, and/or distributeelectricity, gas, or steam. These establishments may be combinations ofany of these services, but also may include other types of services, suchas transportation, communications, refrigeration and pipelines for naturalgas. Water and irrigation systems, and sanitary systems that collect anddispose of garbage, sewage, and other wastes, also are included in thisSIC [1, p. 284].In recent years the utilities covered in SIC 49 have been affected by ongoingchanges in regulations regarding utility rates and competition. Some industrialcustomers have begun producing their own energy and utilities are now competingfor customers outside their service areas. This competition has forcedstructural change and diversification. Utilities have been forced to upgradetheir overall efficiency. With declining interest rates, regulators havebeen decreasing the allowed rate of return for utilities. This, too, hasled to intensified pressures on competition [21, p. 56]. The Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission is currently considering whether to allow utilitiesto open their power lines to other competing utilities. Users would begiven the choice of suppliers. With the decreasing rate of return and theincreasing competition, utilities have stepped up efficiency in order tooffset the impending drop in their profit margins [22, p. 48].Many of the industries in SICs 4911, 4931, 4932, and 4939 are representedby the national trade association, Edison Electric Institute (EEI). Ninety-sevenpercent of all customers serviced by the investor-owned segment of theindustry purchase electricity from EEI members. Members generate 76 percentof the country's electricity [Ex. 3-831].Table C-1 presents employment and establishment data for SIC 49 for 1985.Between 1981 and 1985, SIC 49 experienced a 6 percent growth in employment.In 1985, almost 80 percent of all employees were production workers [2].The median return on assets was 4.0 percent [6].Within this SIC, there are seven three-digit SICs, including establishmentsthat generate, transmit, or distribute electrical energy for sale and thatoperate crude petroleum and natural gas field properties; establishmentsthat transmit and/or store natural gas for sale; establishments that provideelectric or gas services in combination with other services, only if oneservice does not constitute 95 percent or more of revenues; establishmentsthat distribute water for sale for domestic, commercial, and industrialuse; establishments that collect and dispose of wastes conducted througha sewer system, including such treatment processes as may be provided;establishments that produce and/or distribute steam and heated or cooledair for sale; and establishments that operate water supply systems forthe purpose of irrigation [1, pp. 284-286]. In SIC 49, the survey identified nearly twice as many small firms (fewerthan 20 production workers) as large firms. In small firms, maintenancework is predominantly performed by production workers, although some firmsalso use dedicated maintenance workers or outside contractors. Large firmsmainly employ workers specifically for maintenance duties. The manufacturers classified in SIC 49 usually have one to four basic processes,with numerous firms having potential exposures to as many as six differentsubstances. Fifty-five percent of the processes involve exposure to thesechemicals or substances on an intermittent short-term basis (up to 30 minutes),with small firms tending to have more long-term exposures. Most firms inthis SIC have adopted OSHA PELs as their internal standard. Of the largefirms with internal exposure standards, most have adopted OSHA PELs orACGIH TLVs. However, 52 percent of small firms reported having an internalexposure standard. Employee monitoring had been performed at 16 percentof the processes. The survey found that about 25 percent of the processes are totally enclosedand 70 percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust and general ventilationare used frequently to control chemical exposures at processes. Nearly45 percent of the firms with chemical exposures have respirators for employeeuse, with a higher percentage of large firms than small firms reportingthe presence of respirators. The combined data on exposure levels and methodsof exposure control indicate that many plants which are estimated to incursome cost of compliance do not have overexposures in all processes at thatplant. Survey respondents identified the presence of 47 different substances inSIC 49. Chlorine was estimated to occur most frequently at a total of 2,196processes. Chlorine was identified in boilers, water treatment, handlingspills/leaks, incineration, maintenance activities, use of chemical additives,use of disinfectants and solvents, and water purification. SIC 50 and SIC 51_Wholesale TradeThe wholesale trade sector includes establishments engaged in the wholesaleselling of merchandise to retailers; industrial, commercial, institutional,farm, or business users, or to other wholesalers or firms that act as agentsor brokers in the wholesale buying or selling of merchandise. Wholesaletrade is divided into trade in durable goods (SIC 50) and in nondurablegoods (SIC 51). This analysis focuses only on a few of the wholesale tradeindustries (e.g., dealers in scrap and waste materials, SIC 5093; grain,SIC 5191; and paints, varnishes, and supplies, SIC 5198 [1, pp. 24, 250,255-257]. Wholesale trade sales ($1,375 billion in 1985) were fairly equally dividedbetween durable goods and nondurable goods_46 percent and 54 percent, respectively[3, p. 56-7]. Of the approximately 425,000 establishments in wholesaletrade, about five-eighths were in durable goods, and three-eighths werein nondurable goods. The specific four-digit industries studied for thisanalysis include about 11 percent of all wholesale trade establishments[2, pp. 59, 62, 64-65]. Table C-1 shows employment data at the four-digit level. Somewhat lessthan 60 percent of total employment in wholesale trade is in durable goods,while a little more than 40 percent is in nondurable goods. The specificfour-digit industries being analyzed here account for less than 9 percentof all employment in wholesale trade [7]. OSHA received no comments relating to SIC 50, Wholesale Trade, DurableGoods. However, in SIC 51, Wholesale Trade, Non-Durable Goods, OSHA receivedseveral comments. A large number of SIC 51 commenters submitted data and testimony directedat OSHA's proposed 4-mg/m3 TWA exposure limit for grain dust [see, forexample, Exs. 3-47, 3-58, 3-59, 3-65, 3-110, 3-281, 3-347, 3-387, 3-496,3-667, and 3-752]. Several of these commenters provided estimates of thenumber of grain elevators potentially affected by the proposed limit, whichpertains only to wheat, oat, and barley dusts. (Elevators used exclusivelyfor storage are classified in SIC 4221; those used principally for graincleaning and preparation fall within SIC 0723; and elevators that are usedprimarily in wholesale marketing operations are classified in SIC 5153,Wholesale Trade, Grain and Field Beans.) The National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) estimates that approximately87 percent of U.S. grain elevators handle oats, wheat, or barley, basedon USDA records for 1985 that show that this percentage of government-grain-storingelevators reported handling and storing grains of these types [Ex. 3-752];this yields an estimated total of 12,158 grain elevators that are potentiallyaffected by the proposed grain dust limit. The NGFA estimates that approximately49,063 full-time equivalent employees work in these elevators [Ex. 3-752].According to the NGFA, many of the smaller grain elevators have relativelylow profits:<ITAG tagnum="21">A January 1987 survey and analysis by [the] U.S. Department of Agricultureon cooperative grain elevators (Financial Profile of Cooperatives HandlingGrain: First Handlers, $1 Million to $4.9 Million in Sales. USDA, ACS ReportNo. 58, January 1987) indicates the average annual profits for small elevatorfacilities is only $38,272. This report indicated that 24.8 percent ofthese facilities currently have negative profits and another 23.1 percenthave profits of only $25,000 or less [Ex. 3-752, pp. 19-20].</ITAG>In these SICs 19 out of 20 firms identified by the survey were small firms(fewer than 20 production workers). In the small firms, maintenance workis usually performed by production workers, but over 40 percent of allsmall firms use either outside contractors or have a dedicated maintenancestaff. Large firms normally have a dedicated maintenance staff, but overone-quarter use production workers for maintenance and some use outsidecontractors. Of those firms providing chemical or process information, the majorityused from one to three chemicals in one or two processes. However, somefirms reported using up to 10 chemicals. Over half of all exposures areshort-term (up to 30 minutes), with the remaining exposures varying inlength from 1 to 8 hours. The majority of small firms have internal exposurestandards; most of these use OSHA PELs, but some use ACGIH TLVs. Almost90 percent of large firms reported using internal exposure standards, andwere about equally divided between those using OSHA PELs and those usingACGIH TLVs. Air monitoring was being done for approximately one-fifth ofthe processes found in large plants. The survey found that less than 20 percent of the processes are totallyenclosed and that over 50 percent of the processes are located outdoors.In almost 40 percent of the firms with chemical exposures, production workersuse respirators, with large firms reporting a higher percentage of usethan small firms. Survey respondents identified the presence of 80 chemicals in SICs 50 and51. Grain dust was estimated to occur the most frequently at a total of3,426 processes, including drying, packaging/repackaging, receiving andshipping, sorting and grinding. SIC 55_Automotive Dealers and Service Stations This industry sector includes retailers of transportation equipment forpersonal use (new and used automobiles) as well as recreational vehicles(boats, motor homes, and dune buggies); sellers of automobile parts andaccessories; and gasoline stations. Although this industry does not includeestablishments whose primary business is automotive repair, it does includerepair operations that are part of automobile dealerships or service stations.Only those retail outlets that earn more than 50 percent of their revenuesfrom gasoline or lubrication oil sales are included. Many car washes andconvenience stores that sell gasoline are excluded, as are traditionalfull-service gas stations that earn more than 50 percent of their revenuesfrom such activities as repairs, towing, or the sale of auto accessories[1, pp. 265-266]. According to one estimate, this sector includes only55 percent of all retail motor fuel outlets [23, pp. 6-13]. Although manyemployees are involved in selling, some are exposed to chemicals duringpainting or stripping or as a result of the indoor operation of enginesor the use of solvents. As shown in Table C-1, most establishments are relatively small (80 percenthave fewer than 20 employees). Only in one sector, new and used automobiledealerships, do more than half of the establishments have more than 19employees [10]. Even in this sector, however, 90 percent of the establishmentshave fewer than 100 employees [5]. Although the typical operation is relativelysmall, total employment is substantial because of the large number of establishments.New and used automobile dealerships account for 48 percent of total employment,gasoline service stations for 31 percent, and automobile and home supplystores for 16 percent. Although many firms own only a single establishment, large firms own asignificant portion of all establishments, which are operated as chainsunder leasing or franchising agreements.The profitability of firms in SEC 55 is below the national average, witha median return on assets of 5.9 percent in 1986; however, this rate ofreturn improved in 1986 as gasoline prices declined and new car sales increased[6].In the survey, the analysis of SIC 55 was combined with SIC 75, automobilesales and service. The results for the two sectors combined will be reportedhere. In these two SICs, 19 out of 20 firms identified by the survey weresmall firms (fewer than 20 production workers). About two-thirds of thesmall firms use production workers to perform maintenance work. Over 70percent of large firms have a dedicated maintenance staff; the remaininglarge firms are about equally divided between the use of outside contractorsand the use of production employees for maintenance.Of the firms reporting chemical or process use, most use from one to fivechemicals in one to four processes, but 10 percent report using up to 10chemicals. Employees are most commonly subject only to short-term exposures(up to 30 minutes) with less than one-fourth of firms reporting exposuresof from 4 to 8 hours' duration. In these sectors, a majority of small firmshave internal exposure standards. Those that use internal exposure standardsare evenly divided between the use of OSHA PELs and the use of ACGIH TLVs.Almost 90 percent of large firms reported using internal exposure standards,usually OSHA PELs. Air monitoring data was being done for less than 10percent of the processes found in large plants.The survey found that approximately 10 percent of processes are totallyenclosed and that less than 20 percent are located outdoors. In over 40percent of firms with chemical exposures, production workers use respirators,with large firms having a higher percentage of use than small firms.Survey respondents in SICs 55 and 75 identified the presence of 40 differentsubstances. Carbon monoxide was estimated to occur the most frequentlyat a total of 109,093 processes, including cleaning, confined space exposureand maintenance activities. Gasoline was estimated to occur at 24,548 processesand toluene at 23,629.SIC 72_Personal Services and SIC 73_Business ServicesThe personal services industry consists primarily of consumer services.SIC 721, laundry, cleaning and garment services has the highest potentialfor overexposure to chemicals. Other segments of SIC 72 include photographicstudios (SIC 722); beauty shops, barber shops and shoe repair (SIC 723-725);and funeral service and crematories (SIC 726) [1, pp. 298-300].As seen in Table C-1, the number of establishments in 1985 totaled 161,004.Almost all of these (96.9 percent) had fewer than 20 employees in 1985.The mean establishment size was 7 employees. The largest single segmentof this industry is SIC 7231, beauty shops, which totaled 53,165 firmsin 1986 [7]. Total employment (1,056,000 employees in 1985) has increasedover the last several years. In 1986, the value of sales was $39.4 billionin the personal services industry, a 6.6 percent increase over 1985 [7].The median rate of return on assets for the personal services industrywas 10.5 percent in 1985 [6].The dry cleaning industry is likely to be affected by the final rule'sPEL for perchloroethylene. According to the 1982 Census of Service Industries,there were 13,049 dry cleaning plants in the U.S. that used perchloroethylene,with total employment of 89,896 workers.The Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) commented onthe health risks associated with exposure to perchloroethylene. They alsocommented on the feasibility of reducing the exposure of perchloroethyleneto substantially less than the 50 ppm proposed standard. (OSHA notes that,in the final rule, the PEL for perchloroethylene has been reduced to 25ppm.) The International Fabricare Institute (IFI) supported the proposedrevision of the PEL for perchloroethylene to 50 ppm. They stated that approximately64 percent of the dry cleaning industry uses dry-to-dry equipment, andthat over the past four years about 95 percent of all new equipment soldhas been dry-to-dry equipment. The exposure to perchloroethylene is substantiallygreater when using transfer equipment versus dry-to-dry equipment [Ex.8-31]. In 1982 there were 6,738 dry-to-dry machines compared to 12,929dry-to-dry machines in 1988 [Ex. 3-671].The business services industry (SIC 73) consists of several different sectors.Among the sectors included are mailing, reproduction, and commercial artand photography (SIC 733); building cleaning and maintenance services (SIC734); and miscellaneous business services (SIC 739), such as photofinishinglaboratories and commercial testing laboratories [1, pp. 301-308].The number of establishments in the business services industry in 1985totaled 382,626. Almost all of these (90.5 percent) had fewer than 20 employeesin 1985. The mean establishment size was 12 workers. Total employment (4,457,000employees in 1985) has increased over the last several years (4,057,000employees in 1984) [4]. In 1986, the value of sales was $198.7 billionin the business services industry, a 9.2 percent increase over 1985 [7].The median rate of return on assets in SIC 73 was 11.1 percent in 1985[6].In these SICs, the survey identified over 20 times as many small firms(fewer than 20 production workers) as large firms. In the small firms,maintenance work is performed for the most part by production workers,although some firms use outside contractors and some firms employ maintenancestaffs. Large firms divide maintenance work about equally between a dedicatedmaintenance staff, production workers, and outside contractors.Employees are exposed to chemicals on an intermittent short term basis(up to 30 minutes) or continuously (up to 8 hours per day), with smallfirms tending to have more short-term and long-term exposures. Small firmsgenerally have no internal exposure standards; when they do, the OSHA PELsare followed about one-half of the time. Over three-fourths of large firmsreported using the OSHA PELs; the balance indicated that they have no standardsor they rely on ACGIH TLVs. Air monitoring was being conducted at aboutone-tenth of the process found in large plants.The survey found that about one-fourth of the processes are totally enclosedand less than 1 percent are located outdoors. Local exhaust ventilationand general dilution are used most frequently to control exposures at processesnot enclosed or outdoors. In one-tenth of the firms with chemical exposures,production workers use respirators, with a higher percentage of large firmsusing respirators than small firms. The combined data on exposure levelsand methods of exposure control indicate that overexposure is not occurringat any processes in small firms and at less than one percent of the processesin large firms.Survey respondents in this SIC identified eight major processes: permanents,dry cleaning, manicure/pedicure, coloring/dyeing, embalming, washing, exterminating,and photofinishing. Chemicals that were present in these processes included:acetic acid, acetone, calcium hydroxide, chlorine, chlorpyrifos, diazinon,ethylene glycol, glutaraldehyde, iron oxide, isopropyl alcohol, methylalcohol, methyl chloroform, perchloroethylene, naphtha, sodium hydroxide,toluene, trichloroethylene, xylene, and titanium dioxide.SIC 75_Automotive Repair, Services, and GaragesThis sector includes establishments that provide automotive repair, rental,leasing, and parking services to the general public, but excludes gasolinestations (SIC 55) and repair shops that are part of automobile dealershipsor that service commercial fleets [1, p. 309]. Employees may be exposedto engine emissions in parking garages or repair shops, to a variety ofchemical solvents (particularly in painting and stripping), and to dustfrom body work.Eighty-five percent of the establishments are automotive repair shops,which is the sector most likely to have significant chemical exposure,and they employ 61 percent of all industry workers [10]. As shown in TableC-1, SIC 75 is dominated by businesses employing fewer than 20 workers(97 percent), with a median return on assets of 9.2 percent in 1985. Theprofitability of automotive repair and service firms is high, althoughit varies by size and industry sector. Small firms (under $100,000 in assets)had returns of 18.3 percent in 1985, while large businesses (over $1,000,000)had returns of 3.9 percent. Paint shops (SIC 7535) were the most profitabletype of operation, while parking lots (SIC 7523) and parking structures(SIC 7525) registered significantly lower rates of return [6].No rulemaking participants submitted comments on this sector, and the resultsof the survey are reported under SIC 55.SIC 76_Miscellaneous RepairThis industry group includes a wide variety of repair services, differentiatedby object repaired and processes used. Industries of particular concerninclude reupholstery and furniture repair (SIC 7641) and welding (SIC 7692)[1, pp. 312-314]. Reupholstery and furniture repair workers may be exposedto wood dust during wood working, and to solvents; welders may be exposedto fumes.Nineteen percent of the 56,000 industry establishments in SIC 76 are inSIC 7641 and SIC 7692. These two industries account for approximately 14percent of all SIC 76 employment [7, pp. 81-82]. The industry is made up almost entirely of very small firms, and the sectorhas extremely low concentration. Mean business size is 5.5 employees: morethan 95 percent of all establishments have fewer than 20 employees, and65 percent of all workers are employed by establishments of this size.Only 0.2 percent of all miscellaneous repair establishments (with about6 percent of total employment) have 100 or more employees, and only 17establishments have 250 or more. The four-digit industries of concern areeven more completely dominated by small establishments, with a mean sizeof 4.8 employees in SIC 7641 and 3.4 employees in SIC 7692 [7, pp. 81-82].Despite a slight decline in 1981 and 1982, employment in SIC 76 has grownfairly steadily, increasing by 23 percent between 1979 and 1984 and by7 percent between 1984 and 1986. Miscellaneous repair firms have high profit rates. The median 1985 rateof return on assets in SIC 76 was 10.0 percent. This rate of return washigher than that of any two-digit manufacturing industry. The median ratesof return on assets in SIC 7641 and SIC 7692 are over 11 percent [6]. In this SIC, over 99 of 100 firms identified by the survey were small firms(fewer than 20 production workers). In the small firms, maintenance workis normally performed by production workers, with some use of dedicatedmaintenance workers or use of outside contractors. In the large firms,maintenance work is performed by either dedicated maintenance staff, productionemployees, or outside contractors, with a dedicated maintenance staff beingthe most common. Most firms reporting process or chemical use report using one to four chemicalsin one to three processes. For small firms, short-term exposures (up to30 minutes) are the most common, with the remaining exposures ranging from1 to 8 hours in length. In large firms, most exposures are for longer thanone hour. Over three-quarters of large firms in this sector report usinginternal exposure standards; over 55 percent reported using OSHA PELs.A majority of small firms reported having internal exposure standards;more use OSHA PELs than use ACGIH TLVs. Air monitoring data had been collectedfor 26 percent of the processes found in large plants. The survey found that just over one-quarter of the processes are totallyenclosed and that one-quarter are located outdoors. In over 50 percentof the firms with chemical exposures, production workers use respirators;large firms use respirators more commonly than do small firms. Welding fumes were identified most frequently by respondents in SIC 76in some 4,040 welding and brazing processes. No rulemaking participants submitted comments on this sector. SIC 80_Health Services The health services industry encompasses a broad range of medical, surgical,and other health services, both public and commercially owned. These servicesare provided by a variety of practitioners (e.g., physicians, dentists,osteopathic physicians, chiropractors, optometrists) at a variety of facilities(e.g., hospitals, nursing facilities, outpatient care facilities, medicallaboratories) [1, pp. 321-323]. Total expenditures on health care and medical services ($425 billion in1985) are very large, with 40 percent of this amount going to hospitalcare and 20 percent to physicians' services. Expenditures on nursing homecare, drugs and medical sundries, and dentists' services each accountedfor 6 to 8 percent of all health and medical services expenditures [3,p. 54-1]. Data on health care establishments are shown in Table C-1. Although thenumber of health service establishments (313,000) is very large, 85 percentof these are offices of licensed practitioners. No other three-digit sectorwithin the health services industry accounts for more than 4 percent ofhealth service establishments. Total health services employment is very large (6.3 million), with hospitalsaccounting for almost half (i.e., 48 percent) of this workforce. Becauseof their large numbers, practitioners' offices are next in percentage ofworkforce employed (24 percent), followed by nursing and personal carehomes (18 percent). Mean establishment sizes range from six or fewer employeesin practitioners' offices to 250 or more employees in hospitals. The overallmean size of establishments in this industry is 20 employees, with morethan 91 percent of these establishments having fewer than 20 employees,and approximately 22 percent of all SIC 80 employees working in establishmentsof this size. SIC 80 facilities with more than 250 employees employ morethan 50 percent of the workforce in this sector [7; 5]. The health and medical services industry has been expanding rapidly formore than a decade. A variety of factors have caused this increase, includingthe expansion of the elderly population and improved treatment for manyillnesses. In addition, between 1985 and 1986, the price for most medicalservices rose between 6 and 9 percent, compared with 1.5 percent increasein consumer prices. The implementation of Medicare's prospective paymentsystem is also causing major changes in the health care industry [3, pp.54-1, 2]. Hospital care costs have been a major target of cost-cutting measures,resulting in a decline in hospital admissions, a shortening of hospitalstays, and substantial industry restructuring, including increased mergersand acquisitions by large chains, vertical integration, diversificationof services offered, expanded professional peer review, and more businesslikeoperations. Major investor-owned nursing home chains also have experiencedrapid expansion and acquisition [3, pp. 54-1, 2]. For SIC 80 as a whole, the growth rate in expenditures averaged 12.6 percentper year from 1979 to 1984 and more than 9 percent for the next 3 years[3, p. 54-1]. Employment grew by 31 percent between 1979 and 1986, risingby 2 to 5 percent in each year [5]. The growth picture is fairly consistentacross three-digit industries, although expenditures on ``other professionalservices'' have shown the most rapid growth of any health service (16.3percent annually from 1979 to 1984). Expansion has been especially rapidin health maintenance organizations and home health care, both of whichhave the potential for reducing health costs and substituting, to somedegree, for hospital care [3, pp. 54-1 to 54-4]. The median rate of return on assets in health services (5.0 percent in1985) is relatively low compared with that in manufacturing industries,and hospitals have somewhat lower median rates of return than is the casefor health services as a whole. Several ``offices'' industries, on theother hand, have median rates of return higher than 13 percent. Medicaland dental laboratories have median rates of return that are above themedian for two-digit manufacturing industries [6]. In this SIC, nine out of ten firms identified by the survey were smallfirms (fewer than 20 production workers). The majority of small firms employoutside contractors for maintenance work. The majority of large firms usededicated maintenance workers. Of those firms reporting chemical or process use, over half report usingone or two chemicals in one or two processes. In this SIC, most employeeexposures are for less than 30 minutes in length; one-fourth of large firmsreport employee exposures of from 4 to 8 hours in duration. Approximatelyhalf of all small firms have no internal exposure standards and approximatelyhalf report using OSHA PELs. Over 60 percent of large firms report usingOSHA PELs, with only a limited number reporting use of ACGIH TLVs. Largefirms provided air monitoring data for slightly over one-third of all processesfound in their plants. The survey found that almost 50 percent of all processes are totally enclosedand that almost none are outdoors. One-quarter of all firms report usingrespirators, with large firms having somewhat greater respirator use thansmall firms. Survey respondent identified the presence of 73 different substances inSIC 80. Isopropyl alcohol was estimated to occur the most frequently ata total of 38,575 processes, including administration of anesthesia, laboratoryprocedures, making of dental appliances and sterilization. Aryl and inorganiccompounds of mercury were estimated to occur in a total of 25,197 processes,including preparation of dental amalgams and X-ray film processing.

Employee Exposures and Benefits  Employee exposures to the substances included in the scope of this rulemakingare associated with a wide variety of acute and chronic conditions andillnesses. These include sensory irritation, narcosis, organ system dysfunctionn,chronic respiratory disease, neurological impairment, allergic sensitization,and cancer. Since OSHA's adoption of existing Federal and consensus standardlimits in 1971, toxicologic evidence has become available that shows thatadverse health effects can occur as a consequence of exposure to many ofthe substances listed in OSHA's Z tables, and that such health effectsoccur even when exposures are maintained at the current Z-table limits.In addition, many substances that have come into widespread use or beenintroduced since 1971 have been shown to be potentially hazardous in theworkplace environment. OSHA thus believes that reducing worker exposuresto such substances by lowering existing exposure limits or by adding limitsfor previously unregulated substances will result in a significantly reducedrisk of illness to workers.  This chapter describes both the methodology used to identify workers potentiallyexposed to the hazardous substances included in this rulmaking and theexpected benefits to those workers resulting from lowering permissibleexposure levels. An important existing data base for identifying employeespotentially exposed to hazardous substances was OSHA's Integrated ManagementInformation System (IMIS). The IMIS data were used to project expectedbenefits resulting from lowering permissible exposure levels of the substancesbeing regulated.  The IMIS data base, however, was incomplete, and its information on somehazardous chemicals may be out of date. For example, IMIS contained researchinformation on about 160 substances among the approximately 430 substancescovered by the final rule. While the IMIS data base contains the resultsfor over 100,000 samples of substances currently regulated by OSHA , noplant-specific information was available for about 200 of the substancesincluded in this rulemaking but currently not being regulated by OSHA.To both correct this data gap and obtain additional information on employeeexposures, a nationwide survey was begun in January 1988, which was designedto collect worker exposure data from about 5,700 establishments nationwidein industries that are believed to be affected by this rulemaking. Thesurvey results include industry-sector-specific data on the extent of employeeexposures to hazardous materials and, unlike the IMIS data, provide specificinformation on the industrial processes in which these substances are used.While the sample survey confirmed potential exposures for many of the 160chemicals in the IMIS data base, it identified potential exposure problemsfor about 62 additional substances subject to this rulemaking. Thus, thebenefit estimates in this section are based upon employee exposures to212 of the 428 substances being regulated.  To assess the benefits of revising OSHA's Z tables, OSHA relied on boththe survey and IMIS data. The IMIS data were combined with raw survey datato estimate the extent to which employees are currently exposed to substancesincluded in this rulemaking. From this analysis, OSHA estimated the reductionin illness cases and disease-related fatalities associated with reducingexposure limits for these substances.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Description of Data Sources Used  </ITAG>To assess the quantitative benefits associated with this rulemaking, thefollowing data were used:  andbullet; The exposure limits for substances included in the rulemaking; andbullet; Employee exposure data for these substances;  andbullet; Employment data by four-digit SIC code for the base year 1985; andbullet; Annual illness and lost workday rates for the base year 1985;and  andbullet; Health effects information on the substances included in the rulemaking. Employee exposure data for about 160 substances were obtained from OSHA'sIntegrated Management Information System (IMIS). This data base containsexposure measurements obtained by OSHA compliance officers during the conductof thousands of health inspections. For each facility inspected, the IMISfile includes information on the number of employees at the facility, resultsof employee air monitoring for specific substances, and the number of employeespotentially exposed to each substance monitored. To perform the benefitsassessment, a summary IMIS file was created that contained the followinginformation:  andbullet; A list of substances for which personal 8-hour TWA samples weretaken, by four-digit SIC and facility inspected;  andbullet; The number of workers potentially exposed to each substance monitored,by four-digit SIC and facility;  andbullet; The number of employees at each facility inspected;  andbullet; The total number of personal 8-hour TWA samples obtained for eachsubstance, by four-digit SIC and facility; and  andbullet; The number of samples taken at each facility that showed concentrationsexceeding OSHA's limits.  Only those substances for which OSHA is reducing an existing 8-hour TWAlimit or adding a new 8-hour TWA limit were included in the analysis. Atotal of approximately 37,500 personal air sample results for about 160substances were appropriate for use in this analysis. This analysis doesnot estimate the benefits associated with reducing current ceiling limitsor adding new short-term exposure limits (STELs), either because the dataobtained from the IMIS did not include information on sample duration forceiling or peak measurements, or because OSHA was not able to relate theIMIS data on ceiling or peak measurements to the final short-term or ceilinglimits.  In addition to relying on the IMIS exposure data, OSHA completed a majortelephone interview survey of about 5,700 workplaces that are potentiallyaffected by the revision of OSHA's Z tables. Data from this survey provideinformation on substances that are used in a variety of industrial processesat the facilities surveyed, on the number of workers involved in thoseprocesses, and on whether personal exposure measurements taken at the processesexceeded OSHA, ACGIH, or NIOSH limits.  Employment data by four-digit SIC code were obtained from three data sources.For each four-digit SIC represented in the IMIS file, OSHA first reliedon 1985 data from the BLS LABSTAT data base [1]. Where data were unavailablefrom this source at the four-digit SIC level, OSHA relied on Dun andamp;Bradstreet's <T3>Market Identifiers</T3> file for 1985 [2]. Data from 1985 <T3>County Business Patterns </T3>[3] were used to obtain employment datafor four-digit SIC groups not represented in either the LABSTAT or theDun andamp; Bradstreet file.  Data on illness and lost workday rates were obtained from the 1985 LABSTATfile for all industries (at the three- and four-digit level) representedin the IMIS file. These data included rates per 100 employees for totalillness cases, lost-workday illness cases, and total number of lost workdays.<ITAG tagnum="81">Estimates of the Number of Potentially Exposed Employees</ITAG>Estimates of the number of employees potentially exposed to the substancesincluded in this analysis were derived from the IMIS data, OSHA's surveydata, and employment data bases. To conduct the analysis, OSHA used theIMIS and survey data separately to derive independent estimates of thenumber of workers potentially exposed and the number of workers exposedabove the limits for each substance. The estimates derived from these twodata sources were then combined to yield an overall assessment of the extentof employee exposure, by four digit SIC, to substances included in thisrulemaking. The following sections described how each of the data baseswas used to develop estimates of employee exposures, and how these estimateswere then combined.<T3>Estimates Derived From OSHA's IMIS Data Base. </T3>For each facilityinspected, the IMIS contained information on the number of employees atthe facility and the number of employees observed to be potentially exposedto each substance for which personal air samples were collected. For eachsubstance sampled within an industry (at the four-digit level), the estimatednumber of employees potentially exposed to that substance in the industrywas determined by the following formula:<G/><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus1648A</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"/><ITAG tagnum="20">where</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">P<T2>f</T2>=number of employees observed to be potentially exposed to thesubstance at a facility;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">E<T2>f</T2>=total number of employees at the facility;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">W=number of production workers in the industry in 1985; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">P=estimated number of employees potentially exposed to the substancein the industry.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The estimated number of workers currently exposed above the limitsfor each substance was calculated using the following formula:<G/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus. 1648B</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"/><ITAG tagnum="20">where</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">S<T2>f</T2>=number of samples that exceeded the limit for the substanceat all facilities in an industry sector;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">T<T2>f</T2>=total number of personal samples taken for the substance atall facilities in the industry sector;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">P=estimated number of employees potentially exposed to the substancein the industry sector; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Z=estimated number of workers in the industry sector currently exposedabove the limits for the substance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Estimates Derived From OSHA's Survey Data.</T3> Facilities participatingin OSHA's telephone survey provided the following information that wasuseful for estimating the extent of employee exposures to chemical substances:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The facility's four-digit SIC code;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The total number of production employees at the facility;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The number of employees involved in each process used atthe facility;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The substances used or present in each process;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The exposure limits used as internal targets or goals atthe facility (i.e., OSHA's current limits, ACGIH limits, NIOSH limits,or ``Other'' limits such as those from material safety data sheets or insurancecarriers); and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Whether employee exposures exceeded the targeted limits foreach process/chemical combination present at the facility.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To estimate the number of employees potentially exposed to a givensubstance in a four-digit SIC industry group, OSHA assumed that all employeeswho are involved with processes in which the substance is used or presentare potentially exposed.

In instances where the survey data yielded no information on whetheremployees are or are not exposed above the final rule limit for a substance,and no exposure data were available from IMIS on that substance, the numberof workers exposed above the final rule limit for that substance is unknown(this is indicated in Supplement 2 by a blank space). Since it is likelythat in some of these cases there are employees exposed above the finalrule limits, OSHA believes that it has not necessarily accounted for allemployees who are exposed above the final rule limits for the 212 substancesincluded in this analysis. Thus, OSHA believes that the number of overexposedemployees may be understated.Since the publication of the PRIA, OSHA has identified the chemical compositionof several generic and trade-name substances noted as being in use by surveyrespondents. The estimates of potential benefits presented in this finalRIA include employees exposures to substances contained in these genericand trade-name products.<T3>Approach for Combining Estimates Derived from the IMIS Data and SurveyData. </T3>To obtain an overall estimate of the extent of employee exposuresto substances used in each four-digit SIC industry group, OSHA combinedthe estimates derived separately from the IMIS and survey data. Table D-1illustrates how these estimates were combined to yield an overall estimateof the extent of employe exposures in SIC 2851. Where estimates for a givensubstance could be derived from one data set but not the other, the combinedassessment uses the available estimates without adjustment. Where estimatescould be derived from both data sets for the same substance, the combinedassessment is based on the average of the available estimates; this approachhas the effect of giving equal weight to estimates derived from eitherthe IMIS or survey data. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 002 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 1652-1653 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C  </ITAG>Estimates of both the number of employees potentially exposed and the numberexposed above the limits are presented, by substance and four-digit SICcode, in Supplement 2. This supplement also identifies, by four-digit SICcode, substances that are judged to present potential exposure problemsbut for which no IMIS or survey data were available. Aggregate estimates of the number of employees potentially exposed or exposedabove the final limits to any substance considered in the analysis arepresented by two-digit SIC code in Table D-2. Because an employee may beexposed to more than one substance in a given industry, aggregate estimatesof the size of the exposed population are presented as minimum and maximumestimates. Maximum estimates of the size of the exposed population assumethat no employee is exposed to more than one substance; minimum estimatesassume the greatest possible extent of multiple-chemical exposure. Forexample, if 200 employees are estimated to be exposed to acetone and 300employees are estimated to be exposed to toluene in a given industry, aminimum of 300 employees is estimated to be exposed to both substancesin the industry, and maximum of 500 employees is estimated to be exposedto either substance in the industry. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 002 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 1655-1656 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C  </ITAG>Employees exposed above the final limits are considered to be ``at risk''of adverse health effects. It should be noted that this presentation showsrisk reduction in employee-equivalent terms; while all (100 percent) ofthe workers currently exposed above the new limits would benefit from reducedrisk, the new lower limits would not eliminate all chemical exposure risk.An estimated five, ten, or twenty percent residual risk equivalent wouldremain at the new lower limits. Although not quantified, all employeescurrently exposed to hazardous substances at or below the recommended newlevels would experience this residual risk. To obtain an approximationof risk reduction at the revised exposure levels, OSHA estimated that 95,90, or 80 percent of the workers currently exposed above the limits (i.e.,the midpoint between the minimum and maximum estimates) will benefits fromreduced risk after their exposures are lowered to or below the final limits.The results of this analysis are also presented by two-digit SIC codesin Table D-2. The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) [Ex. 72] objected to the approachused by OSHA to obtain the combined assessment. The AISI illustrated thispoint with the following example: <ITAG tagnum="21">[T]he approach used by OSHA in obtaining [exposure estimates] . .. is not logical. If exposures to a substance are indicated in both theIMIS and survey results, the two numbers are averaged. If only one setreports exposures, then that set is used independently. Under this approach,the combined assessment for steelworkers exposed above the proposed standardfor titanium dioxide is listed as 54,510 (the figure derived from OSHA'sIMIS data alone) because no data was identified in this category in OSHA'stelephone survey. It is not clear why the survey does not report data ontitanium dioxide because according to OSHA the chemicals in the surveywere ``selected on the basis of . . . known exposure problems. . . .''If the survey had determined there were zero workers overexposed, thenthe combined assessment would have been reduced to 27,255_that is, 54,510divided by 2 [Ex. 72, p. 11]. </ITAG>OSHA believes that it has designed an approach that makes optimum use ofall of the exposure data available to the Agency. By using the averagingmethod described above, neither the survey data nor the IMIS data are givengreater weight. OSHA realizes, as AISI points out, that the estimate ofthe number of employees exposed to a given chemical in a given industrysector is sensitive because OSHA's methodology uses an averaging approach.However, OSHA believes that the alternative, i.e., reliance on one dataset as opposed to the other, is more disadvantageous because a vast amountof exposure information would have been ignored in the analysis. In addition,OSHA believes that making full use of both the IMIS and survey data minimizesany biases that may be inherent in the information contained in eitherdata set alone. Furthermore, OSHA believes that, by determining maximumand minimum estimates of numbers of exposed employees, uncertainties inthe analysis are appropriately recognized. Some commenters [Exs. 3-890, 8-10, 8-31, and 8-32; Tr. 4-257] providedalternative estimates of the number of employees exposed and overexposedto specific chemicals in specific industries. For example, Dr. Boyd ofthe Styrene Information Research Council (SIRC) reports that, in the reinforcedplastics industry segment, 30,000 workers are potentially exposed to styrene[Ex. 8-32, p.1], a figure smaller than that estimated by OSHA. Eric Frumin,Director of Occupational Safety and Health for the Amalgamated Clothingand Textile Workers Union (ACTWU), reports that OSHA's estimates severelyunderstate the number of workers potentially exposed to perchloroethylenein the dry cleaning industry [Ex. 8-31, pp. 21-23]. OSHA evaluated eachof these commenter's estimates to determine whether OSHA's aggregate benefitsestimates of exposed workers needed to be revised to reflect this new recordevidence. Because OSHA received comparatively few data on the number ofemployees exposed, when compared with the number of industry sectors andsubstances covered in this analysis, OSHA has determined that incorporatingthe estimates provided by commenters would not substantially alter OSHA'saggregate estimate of the benefits associated with revising the air contaminantlimits.<ITAG tagnum="81">Estimates of the Reduction in Illness Cases and Lost Workdays</ITAG>The BLS LABSTAT data base contains illness and lost-workday rates by SICcode. These rates are expressed as the annual number of illness cases ornumber of lost workdays per 100 full-time-equivalent employees. Reducingemployee exposures to hazardous substances to a level below that associatedwith adverse health effects will result in a decrease in the number ofillness cases and lost workdays.To assess the impact on illness and lost-workday rates of reducing employeeexposures, OSHA first examined the relationship between the percentageof workers estimated to be exposed above the final exposure limits forthe 160 substances represented in the IMIS data base and current illnessand lost-workday rates. This analysis was conducted at the three-digitSIC code level because of the lack of illness-rate data for some of thefour-digit SIC code groups. The results of this analysis are presentedgraphically in Figure D-1. Among three-digit industries for which OSHAhas found that no employees are currently exposed above the final limits,total illness case rates reported by the BLS for the same industry groupare usually less than 0.2 cases per 100 employees per year, and frequentlyare reported to be zero. In contrast, where OSHA has found that an industrygroup has more than 10 percent of its workforce exposed above the finallimits, total illness case rates above 0.2 case per 100 employees are frequentlyreported. In few instances does an industry group having 10 percent ormore of its workforce exposed above the final limits report a total illnesscase rate of zero. Among three-digit SIC code industry groups for whichOSHA has not found employee exposures above the final limits, 38 percentof the groups reported an illness rate of zero, 43 percent reported anillness rate of 0.1 to 0.2 case per 100 employees, and only 19 percentof the industry groups reported an illness rate greater than 0.2 case per100 employees (but none above 0.5 case per 100 employees). Given this distributionof illness rates across these particular industry groups, it is concludedthat industry groups in which employee exposures have been controlled toor below the final limits will have an illness rate approximating 0.1 caseper 100 employees. It is believed that total illness cases at the three-digitlevel will be reduced to no more than 0.1 case per 100 employees afterexposures are reduced to or below the final limits.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 1660A</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>OSHA performed a similar analysis that also indicates that the rate oflost-workday illness cases will decline to a base rate of 0.05 cases per100 employees and the annual rate of lost workdays will decline to 1 caseper 100 employees after employee exposures are reduced to or below thefinal limits.OSHA estimated the number of illness cases and lost workdays potentiallyavoided annually by applying current rates to the estimated number of productionworkers per three-digit SIC group; this yielded an estimate of the annualnumber of illness cases and lost workdays reported by each three-digitSIC code industry group. It was assumed that these industries would experienceillness rates of 0.1 cases per 100 employees, 0.05 lost-workday illnesscases per 100 employees, and 1 lost workday per 100 employees per year.Using this approach, OSHA estimated that promulgation of the final limitswill potentially avoid 55.365 illness cases per year, 23,346 lost-workdayillness cases per year, and 519,421 lost workdays caused by illnesses peryear. The movement to a 0.1 illness rate is presented as a best estimate supportedby OSHA's interpretation of the relationship between chemical exposurelevels and current industry illness rates. It may be argued, however, thatif a 0.1 illness rate were achieved, the reduction in illnesses could notbe credited exclusively to OSHA's rulemaking initiative, since some portionof the current BLS illness rate is made up of illnesses associated withexposures to hazardous agents or physical stress (e.g., radiation, noise,ergonomic stress).While no claim is made that this rulemaking action will reduce illnessesrelated to these causes, OSHA believes that the benefit estimates relatedto this final rule of over 55,000 illnesses, over 23,300 lost-workday illnesses,and over 519,000 lost workdays avoided each year are reasonable. This isbased on the finding that company records, upon which the BLS data arebased, rarely show chronic illnesses caused by exposures to toxic substances[4, 6]. The potential level of underreported illnesses in the BLS seriesis illustrated in a recent report by Landrigan and Markowitz [8]. UsingCalifornia physicians' reports of occupational illnesses, these author'sestimated an occupational illness rate among New York State employees thatwas more than twice the BLS illness rate [8].Mr. Frank T. Ryan, Vice President of the Rubber Manufacturers Association(RMA), addressed OSHA's use of the illness rate data, commenting that<ITAG tagnum="20">there may be confounding factors, such as exposure to other substances,work practices, and especially non-occupational considerations, which affectthe illness and lost workday rates. . . . Because this fundamental issueis not addressed in the calculations, the RIA does not derive meaningfulillness or lost workday data [Ex. 3-877, p. 22].</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Similarly, Peter Hernandez, Vice President for Employee Relationsof the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), commented that the PRIAprovided no basis for the assumption that including non-chemical-relatedillnesses in the calculation was offset by the underreporting of illnessesin the BLS statistic [Ex. 72].Landrigan and Markowitz [8] provided a breakout of illness causes in the1984 BLS statistics. They reported that about 30 percent of all illnesseswere caused by trauma or exposure to physical agents. As described above,they also reported that illness cases may be underreported by as much asa factor of 2. This was also reported in a recent article by Suruda andEmmett [9]. Therefore, the extent to which illness cases are underreportedfar outweighs the proportion of illness cases not attributed to chemicalexposures. As such, OSHA believes that inclusion of non-chemically relatedillnesses in the assessment does not result in an overestimate of the annualnumber of illness cases avoided by the final rule.Mr. Hernandez of the AISI also suggested that OSHA's estimates for theillness rates are overestimated because they include dermatitis cases.He noted that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Because dermatitis is among the most common reported illnesses andis not associated with the employee airborne exposures, we believe OSHA'sreliance on Bureau of Labor Statistic data overstates the benefits [Ex.72, p. 13].</ITAG>Although it is true that many of the reported cases of occupational illnessesare skin disorders, OSHA believes that reducing employee airborne exposureswill contribute to a reduction in the number of cases of dermatitis. Asa general rule, workplaces that have many cases of dermatitis are alsomore likely to use poor work practices and to be lacking in engineeringcontrols; such facilities will have higher airborne exposures. On the otherhand, a well-engineered facility with low airborne exposures generallyalso controls its employees' dermal exposures, and therefore has few, ifany, cases of dermatitis. Therefore, OSHA believes that promulgation ofthese exposure limits for air contaminants will encourage the use of improvedwork practices, which will, in turn, reduce the incidence of dermatitis.<ITAG tagnum="81">Estimates of the Number of Employees Potentially at Risk by Type ofHazard</ITAG>In addition to estimating the number of employees exposed to the substancesincluded in this analysis, OSHA also estimated the number of employeeswho are at risk of experiencing particular types of adverse health effects.To conduct this analysis, each substance included in the rulemaking wasassigned to a health hazard category; these assignments were based on theprimary health effects that provided the impetus for reducing a previouslimit or establishing a new limit for a particular substance. (The assignmentof substances to health effect categories is described in detail in SectionVI-C of the preamble.) It should be noted that, in some instances, substancesincluded in this rulemaking were grouped together in the preamble accordingto some basis other than a particular health effect; for example, severalsubstances were grouped together because the ACGIH-recommended limits werederived based on the structural analogy of the grouped substances withthat of other substances. For the benefits analysis described here, thesesubstances were reclassified according to the primary health effect associatedwith exposure to the analogous chemical.The number of employees estimated to be exposed to substances causing aparticular health effect in an industry group was calculated by summingthe number of employees exposed to all substances causing the same effect.Aggregate estimates across all affected industry sectors are presentedin Table D-3. This table provides estimates of employees potentially exposedto substances in each health group, as well as estimates of employees exposedabove the final limits for substances in each health group. Employees arefrequently at risk from a variety of adverse health effects as a resultof concurrent exposure to more than one toxic substance. Thus, the totalnumber of employees considered to be at risk from any type of illness (asestimated in Table D-3) cannot be summed because the sum would result indoublecounting. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illus 1666</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Estimates of the Number of Illness-Related Fatalities Avoided </ITAG>As discussed in the preceding section, OSHA has estimated the number ofemployees currently at risk of experiencing a variety of adverse healtheffects brought about by overexposures to the substance included in thisrulemaking. Many of these adverse effects, in particular, cancer, cardiovasculareffects, chronic respiratory disease, and chronic liver and kidney damage,result in lethal outcomes. OSHA also believes that employees who are excessivelyexposed to substances causing systemic organ damage, neurological impairment,or metabolic effects (i.e., cardiovascular disease through excessive formationof methemoglobin or carboxyhemoglobin, and neurological impairment throughcholinesterase inhibition) are at excess risk of incurring a fatal condition.To estimate the number of fatalities associated with excessive exposureto the 212 substances included in this analysis, OSHA relied on standardU.S. mortality rates and on published estimates of the proportion of fatalitiesthat are believed to be associated with occupational illnesses. These dataallowed OSHA to calculate cause-specific mortality rates that are attributableto occupational illnesses (i.e., mortality rates that represent the excessrisk of mortality from occupational disease). OSHA then applied these occupationallyrelated mortality rates to its estimates of the number of employees exposedto the substances of concern at levels above the final limits. OSHA's methodologyand estimates are presented in Table D-4, and are described in detail below.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 1668</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG><T3>Estimate of the Number of Cancer Fatalities. </T3>The U.S. NationalCenter for Health Statistics has published cause-specific U.S. mortalityrates for 1985 (the most recent data available) [5]. This source reportedthat the annual U.S. cancer death rate in 1985 was 193.3 per 100,000 residents.Based on a total resident U.S. population of 238,740,000 in 1985 [7, p.18], the number of cancer deaths that occurred in 1985 was 461,484. Landriganand Markowitz [8] reviewed several published estimates of the percentageof cancer deaths that are attributable to occupational related disease;these estimates range from less than 5 percent to 33 percent of all cancerdeaths. Landrigan and Markowitz believe that, as a best estimate, 10 percentof all cancer deaths have an occupational origin. Several commenters (Exs. 3-527 and 3-877) expressed the opinion that OSHAhad overestimated the number of occupationally induced cancers that wouldbe prevented by promulgation of the final rule's limits. Specifically,they criticized the study by Landrigan and Markowitz, who estimated that5 to 33 percent of cancer deaths and 1 to 3 percent of all deaths haveoccupational origins. To support this argument, Mr. Ryan, of the RMA, citedthe Doll-Peto study, which stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">On present knowledge, it is impossible to make any precise estimateof the proportion of the cancers today that are attributable to hazardsat work . . . and none of the estimates that have been made are claimedto be anything more than informed guesses. . . . </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> . . . Until objective, nationally representative studies are undertaken,a more realistic assessment of the role of occupational hazards can probablybe obtained by considering each type of cancer separately and estimatingfor each type the possible contribution of occupation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> . . . The proportion of cancer deaths that we have tentatively attributedto occupational causes is, therefore, about 17,000 out of 400,000; i.e.,about 4 percent of all U.S. cancer deaths (Ex. 3-877, pp. 23-24).</ITAG>At the informal hearing, Dr. Landrigan testified that his estimate that10 percent of all cancers are occupationally induced is reasonable:<ITAG tagnum="21">[T]he Doll-Peto estimate is low, for several reasons. First of all,they did not include in their estimate cancers which occurred in peopleover the age of 65. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Many occupational cancers don't develop in people until 20, 30, oreven 40 years after exposure has occurred. Therefore, to cut off attributionof cancer to occupational exposure at age 65 almost certainly reduces theproportion of all cancers which can be attributed to occupation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another factor . . . which . . . diminishes the accuracy of the Doll-Petoestimate is that they excluded from consideration certain categories ofcancer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I think that 10 percent is a reasonable middle-of-the-road estimate.If you like arithmetic manipulation, then that figure is the geometricmean . . . between the Doll-Peto estimate of 4 percent and the old Califanoestimate of 38 percent (Tr. p. 3-285).</ITAG>OSHA believes that Dr. Landrigan's assessment of the Doll and Peto studyis reasonable. Given the wide range in published estimates of the proportionof cancers that are occupationally related (4 to 33 percent), OSHA usedalternative estimates of five and ten percent in the PRIA; the assessmentfor this rule is based on the five percent estimate of all cancer deathsbeing occupationally related. Use of the five percent estimate is consistentwith OSHA's recent benefits analysis for the Hazard Communication standard.Using an occupational cancer death estimate of 5 percent and applying itto the estimated number of cancer deaths in 1985, OSHA estimates that 23,074occupationally related cancer deaths occurred in the United States in thatyear (Table D-4). As the next step, OSHA estimated the overall cancer death rate, both amongthe population that is occupationally exposed to chemicals and among theremainder of the population. In 1985, there were an average of 108,856,000persons employed [10, p. 8]. However, 25,469,200 of these were employedin industries or occupations in which there is a low risk of exposure totoxic substances, such as finance, insurance, real estate, and privatehouseholds [10, pp. 30, 84-88]. The remaining 83,386,800 persons are consideredto be occupationally exposed to chemicals in varying degrees. Many wouldhave only intermittent exposures at very low levels. Assuming that 5 percentof all cancer deaths are of occupational origin, OSHA calculated the annualcancer death rate attributed to occupational exposure by dividing the numberof cancer deaths attributable to occupational illness by the populationexposed, and multiplying that figure by 100,000. OSHA estimates that theannual cancer mortality rate attributable to occupational exposure to toxicsubstances is 27.7 per 100,000. OSHA then estimated that there are 496,832workers currently exposed above the final limits to the potential carcinogensincluded in this rulemaking for which data were available. Applying thework-related cancer death rates to this population, OSHA estimates that138 cancer fatalities occur each year among these workers, and that thesefatalities will be prevented by the final rule. In arriving at this estimate, two important offsetting arguments were considered.Because some of these workers may also be exposed to occupational carcinogensthat are not covered in this rulemaking (such as asbestos or benzene),the number of occupational cancer deaths attributed to the substances includedin this rulemaking may be overestimated. Offsetting this potential overestimateis the fact that the excess mortality rate of 27.7 per 100,000 workerswas developed on the basis of occupational exposures among all workers.However, the excess mortality rate experienced among workers with highaverage exposures to hazardous chemicals typically runs at least two tothree times higher than the national average rate. In consideration ofthis, OSHA believes that any overestimate of cancer fatalities avoidedattributed to regulated chemicals not covered under this rulemaking isoffset by the use of a mortality rate that understates the true excessmortality rate among workers with very high exposures to toxic chemicals.(Additional comments on excess mortality rate estimates are included inthe final section of this chapter.) An alternative analysis of the reduction in cancer mortality was conductedusing OSHA's quantitative risk assessments for the potential human carcinogensincluded in this rulemaking (the results of OSHA's risk assessments arepresented in the preamble to the final rule). This analysis is presentedin Table D-5. Using available data from the combined IMIS and 1988 survey,OSHA found that employees are currently exposed above the final limitsto four of the 17 potential carcinogens listed (acrylamide, carbon tetrachloride,chloroform, and perchloroethylene). Applying quantitative risk estimatesto the estimated number of workers currently overexposed to these foursubstances only, OSHA estimates that compliance with the final limits willavoid 11,519 cancer fatalities over the working lifetime of the population(i.e., 45 years). The average annual reduction in the number of cancerfatalities avoided over 45 years is estimated to be 256.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 1673</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>As noted, although OSHA has evaluated the cancer risk for 17 potentialcarcinogens, there were IMIS data, survey data, and quantitative risk assessments(all of which are necessary for benefits analysis) for only four of these.Lack of IMIS or survey data means that the substance has not been sampledby an OSHA compliance officer or that none of the survey participants indicatedthat the substance was used at their facilities. This does not mean thatno workers are currently exposed to these substances. Lacking a basis forestimating the extent of employee exposure, OSHA could not estimate theextent of reduction in cancer deaths attributable to the reduction in exposurelimits for these substances. To the extent that employee exposure to thesecarcinogens is reduced, further reductions in the number of cancer deathswill occur. <T3>Estimated Reduction in Occupational Deaths from Causes Other than Cancer.</T3>As shown in Table D-4, OSHA also estimated the number of occupationallyrelated fatalities that are expected to occur annually among employeesexposed to substances associated with adverse health effects other thancancer. To perform this analysis, OSHA relied on an estimate made by Landriganand Markowitz [7] that between 1 and 3 percent of all nonmalignant diseaseis of occupational origin. Using the 1- and 3-percent figures as alternativeassumptions and using the same methodology as that described above forcancer deaths, Table D-4 shows the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">_Between 13 and 40 deaths caused by respiratory disease are estimatedto occur each year among workers exposed to respiratory toxins coveredin this rulemaking;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Between 2 and 5 deaths are estimated to occur each year among workersexposed to liver toxins covered in this rulemaking; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">_Between 258 and 771 deaths are estimated to occur each year amongworkers exposed to systemic toxins, cardiovascular toxins, metabolic toxins,and neurological toxins covered in this rulemaking.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Summing these estimates, OSHA believes that between 411 and 954 non-cancer-relatedoccupational fatalities occur each year.

For example, if itis assumed that only half of the estimated number of cancer fatalitieswould be avoided (a conservative assumption, given that most PELs are beingreduced by more than a factor of 5), then the estimated annual number ofcancer fatalities avoided would be 69 rather than 138. The estimated totalannual number of avoidable deaths from all causes would range from 324to 885. This estimate is only about 7 to 17 percent less than the estimateof 411 to 954 avoidable deaths reported in the Table D-4. Since cancerfatalities avoided represent only a part of the benefits to be achievedthrough this rulemaking, changing the assumption on cancers avoided willnot result in a substantial change to the total number of avoidable fatalitiesattributable to revising the PELs. Furthermore, OSHA's alternative approach,which relies on the quantitative estimates of risk, identified a largernumber of cancers avoided each year (256). This latter method takes intoaccount the presence of residual risk at the revised PELs. AISI (Ex. 188, p. 43) also argued that OSHA overstated benefits estimatespresented in the PRIA because the effect of the Hazard Communication standardwas not considered. In that rulemaking, OSHA determined that the hazardcommunication standard could reduce occupation-related cancers by 20 percent.If the beneficial effects of the Hazard Communication standard are consideredin assessing the benefits associated with revising the PELS on Table Z,the maximum effect would be to reduce OSHA's estimate of cancer fatalitiesavoided by 20 percent (i.e., from 138 to 115). In sum, the combined estimate for the number of cancer and noncancer deathspotentially avoided each year by compliance with the new limits is between411 and 954 or an average of 683 fatalities avoided each year. OSHA considersthese to be reasonable estimates of the benefits associated with revisingthe PELs on Table Z.<T3>Additional Comments and an Alternative Method for Estimating ExcessMortality Rates.</T3> The analysis described above to estimate the numberof fatalities that are potentially preventable relies on published estimatesof the proportion of all U.S. fatalities that are believed to result fromoccupational illnesses. These estimates were used with U.S. cause-specificmortality rate figures to estimate the excess mortality rate among allU.S. workers, by cause of death (shown in Table D-4). In making these excess mortality rate estimates, OSHA applied the excessnumber of fatalities across the entire U.S. working population. Implicitin this approach is an assumption that all workers are at some risk offatality from all causes of death. In fact, only a portion of the workforceis at risk of fatality from each type of occupational illness. Deaths willoccur only among workers who are potentially exposed to carcinogens; noexcess deaths will occur among workers who are not so exposed. Similarly,not all workers are at risk of dying from occupationally related cardiovascularillnesses; only some portion of the workforce are at excess risk, and allfatalities resulting from occupationally related cardiovascular diseasewill occur among this subset of workers. Because OSHA's excess mortalityrate estimates presented earlier were derived by applying the estimatednumber of work-related fatalities across the entire U.S. workforce, excessmortality rate figures are likely to be substantially understated.To assess the magnitude of this bias, OSHA conducted an alternative analysisto estimate the number of work-related fatalities that are expected tooccur among workers exposed above the final limits. This alternative assessmentrelied on judgments regarding the general increase in mortality rates thatare frequently observed in epidemiologic studies that demonstrate a causalrelationship between exposure to toxic substances and excess disease mortality.The alternative assessment is presented in Table D-6. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 0 _ 1678</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>The overall U.S. cancer mortality rate for 1985 is 193.3 deaths per 100,000residents (Table D-6). Typically, when causal relationships between exposureand excess lung cancer mortality are found in epidemiologic investigations,the exposed cohort frequently shows a cancer mortality rate of 1.1 to 10times higher than the general population. For cancers that are more rarethan lung cancer, mortality rates among working populations may be 50 timeshigher than for the general population. An alternative estimate of thenumber of cancer fatalities expected to occur among the estimated 499,716workers exposed above the final limits for the potential carcinogens couldbe developed based on the assumption that the overall cancer fatality rateamong these workers is twice that of the U.S. population (i.e., 386.6 per100,000 workers versus 193.3 per 100,000 residents). The <T3>excess </T3>cancer mortality rate among these workers is thereforeassumed to be 193.3 per 100,000 workers (386.6 minus 193.3). Applying thisestimated excess cancer mortality rate to the 496,832 workers exposed abovethe final limits yields an estimated 960 cancer deaths occurring annuallythat are attributable to occupational exposure. For example, Duh and Asal[Ex. 8-31, App. 7] reported excess lung cancer death rates for drycleaningworkers of 1.7 times expected death rates, as well as kidney cancer deathrates of 3.8 times expected rates. Similarly, EPA [Ex. 1-1132] reportedstandard mortality ratios for lung cancer of generally between one andten for nickel refinery workers. This same approach could be used for estimatingnon-cancer-related fatalities assuming that the overall fatality rate amongworkers at risk from these illnesses is 1.3 times the corresponding U.S.mortality rate (mortality rates of 1.1 to 1.5 are frequently observed inepidemiologic studies demonstrating causal relationships between exposureand excess fatalities). This amounts to an <T3>excess </T3>mortality rate of 30 percent above the overall U.S. rate.Applying these excess mortality rate figures to the estimated worker populationsexposed above the final limits, OSHA estimates that, among these workers,140 deaths occur annually due to chronic pulmonary disease, 18 deaths occurannually due to liver disease, and 2,696 deaths occur annually due to cardiovascular,neurological, and renal diseases. In total, including cancer, OSHA estimatesthat 3,814 work-related fatalities (including those from cancer) may beoccurring each year among employees who are exposed above the limits tothe hazardous substances included in this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="73">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.

Assessment of Nonregulatory Alternatives<ITAG tagnum="81">Introduction </ITAG>The declared purpose of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of1970 is ``. . . to assure so far as possible every working man and womanin the Nation safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve ourhuman resources. . . .'' Thus, the Act requires the Secretary of Labor,when promulgating occupational safety and health standards for toxic materialsor harmful physical agents, to set the standard ``. . . that most adequatelyassures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence,that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functionalcapacity. . . .'' It is on the basis of this congressional directive thatOSHA has initiated regulatory actions to reduce the adverse health effectsassociated with occupational exposure to hazardous substances.<ITAG tagnum="81">Market Failure </ITAG>Economic theory suggests that the need for government regulation is greatlyreduced where private markets work efficiently and effectively to allocatehealth and safety resources. The theory typically assumes perfectly competitivelabor markets where workers, having perfect knowledge of job risks andbeing perfectly mobile among jobs, command wage premiums that fully compensatefor any risk of future harm. Thus, theoretically, the costs of occupationalinjury and illness are borne initially by the firms responsible for thehazardous workplace conditions and, ultimately, by the consumers who payhigher prices for the final goods and services produced by these firms.With all costs internalized, private employers have an incentive to reducehazards wherever the cost of hazard abatement is less than the cost ofthe expected injury or illness. The resultant level of safety and healthis considered ``efficient'' in the sense that it minimizes the sum of thecosts of hazard prevention and of injury or illness. Perfectly competitivelabor markets, however, do not exist for many industrial markets. OSHA,therefore, believes that it must take appropriate actions to provide greaterhealth protection for workers exposed to toxic substances.  Evidence indicates that market forces have not been effective in reducingexcessive occupational exposure to hazardous substances, thereby contributingto the consequent development of occupational diseases. In spite of thedanger associated with the inhalation or other exposure to hazardous substances,the social costs of production have not been internalized, in part, becauseof market imperfections and the existence of externalities. Consequently,the amount of protection that the private market will offer to workersdiffers from the socially desired level. First, evidence on occupational health hazards in general suggests thatin the absence of immediate or clear-cut danger, employees and employershave little incentive to seek or provide information on the potential long-termeffects of exposure. Employers faced with potentially high compensatorypayments may, in fact, have a disincentive to provide information to employees.When relevant information is provided, however, employers and employeesmight still find informed decisionmaking a difficult task, especially wherelong latency periods precede the development of chronic disabling disease.Moreover, if signs and symptoms are nonspecific_that is, if an illnesscould be job-related or could have other causes_employees and employersmay not link disease with such occupational exposure. Second, even if workers were fully informed of the health risks associatedwith exposure to hazardous substances, many face limited employment options.Nontransferability of occupational skills and high national unemploymentrates sharply reduce a worker's expectation of obtaining alternative employmentquickly or easily. A worker employed in a foundry, for example, could findit difficult to apply occupational skills to a new job in searching fora safer workplace. In many regions of the country, the practical choice for workers is notbetween a safe job and a better paying but more hazardous position, butsimply between employment and unemployment at the prevailing rates of payand risk. In addition to the fear of substantial income loss from prolongedperiods of unemployment, the high costs of relocation, the reluctance tobreak family and community ties, and the growth of institutional factorssuch as pension plans and seniority rights serve to elevate the cost ofjob transfer. Thus, especially where wages are more responsive to the demandsof more mobile workers who tend to be younger and perhaps less aware ofjob risks, hazard premiums for the average worker will not fully compensate.Where this is the case, labor market negotiations are unlikely to reflectaccurately the value that workers place on health. In addition to the market imperfections, externalities occur if employersand employees settle for an inefficiency low level of protection from hazardoussubstances. For the competitive market to function efficiently, only workersand their employers should be affected by the level of safety and healthprovided in market transactions. In the case of occupational safety andhealth, however, society shares part of the financial burden of occupationallyinduced diseases, including the costs of premature death, chronic illness,and disability. Those individuals who suffer from occupationally relatedillness are cared for and compensated by society through taxpayer supportof social programs, including welfare, Social Security, and Medicare. Thesecombined factors of labor market imperfections and the existence of externalitiescontribute to the failure of the market to supply healthful working conditionsin industries where hazardous substances exist.<ITAG tagnum="81">Tort Liability </ITAG>The use of liability under tort law is one nonregulatory alternative thathas been increasingly used in litigation concerning occupationally relatedillnesses. Prosser [1] describes a tort, in part, as a ``civil wrong, otherthan a breach of contract, for which the court will provide a remedy inthe form of an action for damages,'' although he says that ``a really satisfactorydefinition has yet to be found.'' If the tort system applies, it would allow a worker whose health has beenadversely affected by occupational exposure to a hazardous substance tosue and recover damages from the employer. Thus, if the tort system iseffectively applied, it might shift the liability of direct costs of occupationaldisease from the worker to the firm under certain specific circumstances.With very limited exceptions, however, the tort system is not a viablealternative in dealings between employees and their employers. All stateshave legislation providing that Workers' Compensation is either the exclusiveor principal remedy available to employees against their employers. Thus,under tort law, workers with an occupational disease caused by exposureto a hazardous substance can only file a product liability suit againsta third party manufacturer (e.g., Johns Manville), processor, distributor,sales firm, installer, agency, or contractor. It is often difficult, however,to demonstrate a direct link between an exposure to a hazardous substanceand the illness. In order to pursue litigation successfully, there must be specific knowledgeof the magnitude and duration of a worker's exposure to a hazardous substance,as well as the causal link between the disease and the occupational exposure.Usually, it is extremely difficult to isolate the role of occupationalexposures in causing the disease, especially if workers are exposed tomany toxic substances. This difficulty is further compounded by the longlatency periods that are frequently involved. In addition, the liable partymust be identifiable, but workers may have several employers over a workinglifetime. The burden of proof that an occupational exposure to a hazardoussubstance occurred, that a specific employer is the liable party, and thatthe exposure level was significant may prohibit the individual from initiatingthe suit.The costs associated with producing information and with litigation itselfmay be quite substantial. First, information is a public good, which meansthat once produced it can be transmitted inexpensively to any number ofindividuals without diminishing the quality or quantity of the information.It is therefore, difficult to control distribution once the informationis produced. A producer of information may find that information producedat great expense can be acquired freely by potential customers, and thatconsequently, the market for the information has virtually disappeared.As a result, public goods are typically underproduced relative to whatis considered economically efficient. This general undersupply of informationadversely affects workers' awareness of the cause of their illness andthus reduces the likelihood that they will pursue tort liability suits.Second, legal proceedings impose costs on both plaintiffs and defendants.In deciding whether to sue, the tort victim must be sure that the sizeof the claim will be large enough to cover legal expenses. In effect, theplaintiff is likely to face substantial transaction costs in the form ofa contingency fee, commonly 33 percent, plus additional legal expenses.The accused firm must also pay for its defense. The majority of occupational disease tort activity has involved workersexposed to asbestos. To date, approximately 100,000 individual plaintiffshave filed asbestos lawsuits in the country. These employees avoided theexclusive remedy of Worker's Compensation by suing suppliers of asbestosinstead of employers. A report prepared by the Research Triangle Instituteentitled. <T3>Tort Liability and Worker Health: An Examination of the Economic, Legal,and Scientific Issues Surrounding the Occupational Disease Protection Affordedby Tort Law </T3>[2], contains some data pertaining to legal costs andthe size of awards. One investigator, for example, found that an averageratio of legal costs to proceeds was 37 percent for a sample of cases.The data, however, do not separate legal fees paid by the defendants andplaintiffs. Insurance and liability costs are not borne in full by the specific employerresponsible for the risk involved. For firms that are insured, the premiumdetermination process is such that premiums only partially reflect changesin risk associated with changes in exposure to hazardous substances. Thislack of complete adjustment is the so-called ``moral hazard problem,''which is the risk that arises from the possible dishonesty or imprudenceof the insured. As the insured firm has paid an insurance company to assumesome of the risks, that firm has less reason to exercise the diligencenecessary to avoid losses. Transfer of risk is a fundamental source ofimperfection in markets.*<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>* For a general discussion of moral hazard as a source ofmarket failure, see Arrow [4] and Spence and Zechhauser [5]. For applicationsof this concept to employee health and safety, see Chelius [6], Rea [7],and Consad and General Research Corporation [8, Section 5.1].For firms that self-insure or carry liability insurance with a large deductible,the costs of a single claim may be fully borne by the firm. Very smallfirms, and large firms with a large number of claims, however, may failto meet the full costs by declaring bankruptcy. For example, the JohnsManville Corporation**<NOTE/> declared bankruptcy to avoid massive claims associated withasbestos-related disease. Although the firm experienced a sharp declinein the value of its stock, it is still in business, while its obligationto pay asbestos-related claims is in considerable doubt. Other asbestosproducers, including U.N.R. Industries, Inc. and Amatex Corporation, havefollowed the example of the Manville Corporation by filing for bankruptcy[9], further reducing the chances that their workers or others who contractasbestos-related diseases will collect Worker's Compensation or tort liabilityawards<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>** Johns Manville Corporation, formerly the world's largestasbestos manufacturer, filed for Chapter XI protection under the FederalBankruptcy Law in August 1982. The company was financially solvent whenit filed for bankruptcy but estimated that it would ultimately face a costof more than $2 billion to settle 52,000 asbestos-related claims. In themeantime, the company's assets have been frozen and successful plaintiffscannot collect awards [9].<ITAG tagnum="81">Workers' Compensation </ITAG>The Workers' Compensation system is a result of the perceived inadequaciesin liability or insurance systems to compel employers to prevent occupationaldisease or compensate workers fully for their losses. The system was designedto internalize some of the social costs of production, but in reality,it has fallen short of compensating workers adequately for occupationallyrelated disease. Thus, society shares the burden of occupationally relatedadverse health effects, premature mortality, excess morbidity, and disabilitythrough taxpayer support of social programs such as welfare, Social Securitydisability payments, and Medicare. Compensation tends to be inadequate, especially in permanent disabilitycases, in view of the expiration of benefit entitlements and the failureto adjust benefits for changes in a worker's expected earnings over time.As of January 1987, 8 states still restricted permanent disability benefitseither by specifying a maximum number of weeks for which benefits couldbe paid or by imposing a ceiling on dollar payments [10]. At present, time and dollar restrictions on benefit payments are even moreprevalent in the area of survivor benefits. The duration of survivor benefitsis often restricted to 10 years, and dollar maximums on survivor paymentsrange from $7,000 to $60,000. In addition, it should be noted that if theemployee dies quickly from the occupational illness and has no dependents,the employer need pay only nominal damages under Workers' Compensation(i.e., a $1,000 death benefit). Finally, in spite of current statutory protection, disability from occupationaldiseases represents a continuing, complex problem for Workers' Compensationprograms. Occupational diseases may take years to develop, and more thanone causal agent may be involved in their onset. Consequently, disabilitiesresulting from occupationally induced illness often are less clearly definedthan those from occupationally induced injury. As a result, Workers' Compensationis often a weak remedy in the case of occupational disease. For example,as recently as April 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an occupationaldisease case (<T3>Richard D. Bunker </T3>v. <T3>National Gypsum Co.</T3>) involving a worker who was diagnosed as havingasbestosis 23 years after the expiration of the 3-year time limit allowedby Indiana law for filing a compensation claim [11]. Indeed, there is someevidence indicating that the great majority of occupationally induced illnessesare never reported or compensated [12].The insurance premiums paid by a firm under the Workers' Compensation systemare generally not experience rated_that is, they do not reflect the individualfirm's job safety and health record. About 80 percent of all firms areineligible for experience rating because of their small size. Such firmsare class rated, and rate reductions are granted only if the experienceof the entire class improves. Even when firms have an experience rating,the premiums paid may not accurately reflect the true economic losses.Segregation of loss experience into classes is somewhat arbitrary, andan individual firm may be classified with other firms that have substantiallydifferent normal accident rates. An experience rating is generally basedon the benefits paid to workers, not on the firm's safety record. Thus,employers may have a greater incentive to reduce premiums by contestingclaims than by initiating safety measures. In summary, the Workers' Compensation system suffers from several defectsthat seriously reduce its effectiveness in providing incentives for firmsto create safe and healthful workplaces. The scheduled benefits are significantlyless than the actual losses to the injured workers, and recovery is oftenvery difficult in the case of occupational diseases. Thus, the existenceof a Workers' Compensation system limits an employer's liability significantlybelow the actual costs of the injury. In addition, premiums for individualfirms are unlikely to be specifically related to that firms's risk environment.The firm, therefore, does not receive the proper ``signals'' and consequentlyfails to invest sufficient resources in reducing workplace injuries andillnesses. The economic costs not borne by the employer are borne by theemployee or, as is often the case, by society through public insuranceand welfare programs. <ITAG tagnum="81">Standards of Other Organizations</ITAG>Traditionally, representatives of professional organizations have collectivelydeveloped voluntary guidelines to assist members in maintaining safe andhealthful working conditions for their employees. These guidelines arewidely disseminated among members of the organizations and, at times, havebeen adopted as guidelines by organizations beyond the initiating one aswell as by industry groups. In some cases they have become the <T3>de facto</T3> industry standard. Three professional organizations havedeveloped voluntary guidelines in the form of exposure limits for chemicalsubstances: The American National Standards Institute (ANSI); the AmericanIndustrial Hygiene Association (AIHA); and the American Conference of GovernmentalIndustrial Hygienists (ACGIH). ANSI has withdrawn its earlier hazardoussubstance standards and has stated it does not intend to publish any others.The AIHA has a rather limited list of recommended limits. However, theACGIH has published an extensive list of threshold limit values (TLVs)for many years. The ACGIH is recognized throughout the world for its members'expertise and contribution to industrial hygiene.In May 1971, OSHA adopted as Federal health standards the exposure limitsrecommended by ANSI and ACGIH for 425 chemicals. Since that time, advancesin scientific knowledge have demonstrated that those limits are not alwaysadequate to protect employee health. Consequently, the ACGIH, the professionalorganization which continues to develop TLVs, has changed its recommendationsyearly to reflect later information. However, adherence to the TLVs developedafter 1971 is purely voluntary. Except for imminent hazards, there is nosanction for failure to comply with the limits and many employers havenot adopted practices which would control employee exposure to these newlevels.In addition to professional organizations, international bodies such asthe European Economic Community, the International Labor Organization,and the World Health Organization have recommended exposure limits forsome hazardous substances. While these limits may not be as widely knownin the United States as those of U.S. professional organizations, theyare made available to the industrial hygiene community through professionaljournals and meetings. Within the U.S., the National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health (NIOSH) of the Department of Health and Human Serviceshas published recommended exposure limits (RELs) for a number of chemicals.These are publicized through NIOSH Current Intelligence Bulletins and otherpublications which are widely disseminated.Although the ACGIH TLVs and the NIOSH RELs are widely recognized by healthprofessionals and employers alike, OSHA has found that some employers arenot complying voluntarily with the newer TLVs, the RELs, or the standardsof other bodies. Chapter D discussed OSHA's estimates of the extent ofexposures in excess of the TLVs, and the adverse health effects resultingfrom such exposure. OSHA believes that significant numbers of employeesare exposed to chemicals at levels exceeding those recommended by otherorganizations, and that OSHA cannot rely on employers to comply voluntarilywith the recommendations. Therefore, OSHA concluded that this nonregulatoryalternative is not generating the optimal level of occupational health.<ITAG tagnum="81">Conclusion</ITAG>OSHA believes that there are no nonregulatory alternatives that adequatelyprotect workers from the adverse health effects associated with exposureto the chemicals regulated in this rulemaking. OSHA believes that tortliability laws and Workers' Compensation do not provide adequate workerprotection due to market imperfections. Some employers have not compliedwith the standards recommended by professional organizations. The deleterioushealth effects resulting from continued high levels of exposure to hazardoussubstances require a regulatory solution.The National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) has disagreed with OSHA'sconclusion that this rule is necessitated by a situation of market failure[Ex. 180A]. NGFA claims that OSHA ``ultimately rejects each of the alternativesbecause of what it characterizes as imperfections in the ability of eachof the alternatives to meet fully that alternative's theoretical objectives.''OSHA is not implying that nonregulatory alternatives are complete failures,but that they are not total successes. That they are partial failures isprecisely the situation that creates the need for OSHA. Because OSHA cannotwrite and enforce a unique set of regulations for each facility, the regulationsmust be written and enforced on an industry-wide basis. This does not implythat all firms have failed to adopt guidelines, but that some have andthat workers at these firms are potentially at risk.The rules will not impact on those entities which have already adoptedthe voluntary guidelines of ACGIH and NIOSH. What the rule will do is compelthose firms that have done little voluntarily, to act. Furthermore, firmswhich comply voluntarily can be at a competitive disadvantage in the shortrun. When some firms don't comply with voluntary standards, the pressurenot to comply increases on all firms. When all firms must comply with aregulation, none should be at a competitive advantage or disadvantage asa direct result of the regulation.NGFA also states that although none of the nonregulatory alternatives areperfect, imperfection is not justification for ``dismissing that alternativeas a failure,'' and that ``the relevant question is whether or not thesealternatives_on the whole_promote workplace safety, and to what extentthey do so.'' OSHA fully agrees with these statements. Certainly the alternatives,when followed, do promote workplace safety, but the extent to which theydo so may not be sufficient. The 1988 sample survey showed that, amongfirms where there are chemical exposures, 20 percent would not be in compliancewith the new standards and less than 15 percent of firms making or usinghazardous substances, did exposure monitoring. OSHA believes these factsreflect the market's failure to better control exposures to hazardous substances.The situation of imperfect information is also questioned by NGFA. Theycite the availability of information from various sources (news media,labor unions, local public interest organizations, plaintiffs' attorneys),stating ``all of whom_for their own reasons_aggressively spread the wordabout substances that may present occupational health risks.'' The commentsand testimony received for this rulemaking present an ideal example ofthe problems of information. First, the information is often presentedin a selective manner precisely because the presenters are working ``fortheir own reasons.'' The NGFA maintained in the hearing that there areno substantive hazardous exposure problems at grain elevators and has suedOSHA to try to prevent the hazard communication standard from informingtheir workers of any risk. Yet grain dust has been known to cause diseasesince at least 1713 and most, if not all, impartial expert organizationshave concluded it does cause disease. Second, the sheer volume of informationin some cases is overwhelming. Third, the highly technical nature of muchinformation makes analysis extremely difficult, except for the specialist.For example, the industrial structure of grain handling is segmented amongseveral major industry categories (SICs). Information from one subcategorycan be inadvertently misrepresented to apply to all grain handling facilities.The combination of these factors can make analysis of information, evenwhen it is available, very difficult or inconclusive.NGFA asserts that the tort system provides better recourse for employeesthan OSHA admits. As just discussed, the tort system provides only an imperfectremedy. The employees' damages are restricted under Workers' Compensationand it is difficult to prove causation. The only possible defendant isthe supplier, not the employer. This does not encourage employers to takeprecautions. The greatest problem with the tort system is that torts area retroactive remedy, after illness or death, whereas OSHA has a responsibilityto assure, to the extent feasible, that no employee will suffer materialimpairment of health or functional capacity prospectively. Although thethreat of a tort may help to prevent health damage to employees, it remainsmore a form of compensation for injuries suffered than a preventive measure.NGFA contends that, ``A profit-maximizing employer certainly will incorporatethose additional costs (insurance, hiring, training, goodwill) in its considerationof necessary safety measures.'' OSHA agrees that, in the ideal, employersand manufacturers would provide a high level of safety and health protectionto their employees. This is not, however, reflected everywhere in reality.Long-term implications of safety and health problems are often ignoredor underestimated in the pursuit of short-term profits.OSHA, therefore, does no agree with the NGFA's arguments and continuesto believe that there are no nonregulatory alternatives that adequatelyprotect workers from the adverse health effects associated with exposureto the chemicals regulated in this final standard.<ITAG tagnum="73">References</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1.

Technological Feasibility<ITAG tagnum="81">Feasibility Determination</ITAG>This chapter presents a technological feasibility analysis of industry'sability to meet OSHA's proposed permissible exposure limits (PELs) fora wide range of occupational health hazards. These PELs would include limitson airborne concentrations of substances, and in some instances, directcontact of the skin with the substance.The control of workplace exposures to toxic chemicals involves combininga variety of standard techniques to solve a situation-specific problem.OSHA believes that existing engineering controls are available to reduceexposure levels to the new levels.In reviewing the comments and hearing testimony on the technological feasibilityof achieving the PELs and other limits, OSHA has found that for the overwhelmingmajority of situations where air contaminants are encountered by workers,compliance can be achieved by applying known engineering control methodsand work practice improvements. It is recognized, however, that in somecircumstances, respiratory protection may be necessary.<ITAG tagnum="81">Types of Controls</ITAG>In general, three basic types of controls may be employed to reduce employeeexposures:andbullet; Engineering controlsandbullet; Work practices and administrative reformsandbullet; Personal protective equipmentConsistent with OSHA regulations and policy, this chapter examines thefeasibility of engineering controls and work practices to control employeeexposure, in preference to personal protective equipment.<T3>Engineering Controls. </T3>Engineering controls involve the use oflocal exhaust ventilation, general ventilation isolation of the workerand enclosure of the source of emissions process modifications equipmentmodifications and substitution of non-hazardous chemicals. These methodsmay be used alone or in combination of any two or more controls dependingupon the needs of a specific situation. Variations in situations usuallyresult from the type of process being used and the number of chemicalsin the air. However, these controls are considered standard techniqueswhich will effectively control these variables either by themselves, orcoupled with changes in work practices.<T3>Ventilation. </T3>Perhaps the most widely used technique for controllingchemical exposures is the use of ventilation. General ventilation usesthe movement of air within the general work space to displace or dilutethe contaminant with fresh outside air. General ventilation is not typicallythe preferred control method in most operations due to the large volumesof air movement required. Local exhaust ventilation uses much smaller volumesof air, exhausted from the point at which contaminants are generated toremove the contaminant at the source.<T3>Isolation. </T3>Isolation involves placing a physical barrier betweenthe hazardous operation and the worker. Many modern, automated manufacturingprocesses are now fully enclosed in ventilated cabinets. The effectivenessof such a control technique depends on the frequency with which the workershave to enter the enclosure during normal operations. In other situations,rather than placing the process or machine in an enclosure, the workermay be put into a controlled atmosphere enclosure. Many processes whichinvolve potential chemical exposures are operated remotely by operatorsin air conditioned booths.<T3>Substitution. </T3>Substitution refers to the replacement of a toxicchemical in a particular process or work area with another, less toxicproduct. Properly applied, substitution can be a very effective controltechnique. However, care must be taken to ensure that the proposed substituteperforms in a similar manner to the product being replaced. In addition,it is essential that the substitute be carefully evaluated to ensure thatin controlling one hazard, another different hazard is not inadvertentlyintroduced. The substitute must also be compatible with existing manufacturingequipment and processes.The success of these techniques will depend on the physical propertiesof the chemicals and emissions encountered (boiling point, vapor pressure,etc.) and the process operating conditions (temperature, pressure, etc.).In some cases, particularly with cleaning solvents, substitution may providethe quickest and most effective means of reducing exposure. In other situationswhere particular physical or chemical properties are required, major effortmay be required to alter processes or install or expand local or generaldilution ventilation. The extent to which engineering controls may be effectivelyused will vary from industry to industry, as well as plant to plant withinan industry.<T3>Work Practices and Administrative Reforms. </T3>Work practice controlsinclude housekeeping procedures, material handling or transfer procedures,leak detection programs, training and personal hygiene. In many cases,it is possible to bring about substantial reductions in employee exposuresby applying work practice controls.<T3>Personal Protective Equipment. </T3>Where it is impractical to applyengineering or work practice controls, or where their application willnot consistently reduce employee exposures below the proposed PELs, personalprotective equipment such as respirators, may be used to prevent and reduceexposures. <ITAG tagnum="81">Industry Engineering Controls</ITAG>To determine whether engineering controls and work practices can reduceemployee exposures to the proposed PELs, OSHA, through its contractors,examined typical work processes found in a cross section of industries.Using this list, industry experts identified which major processes hadpotential hazardous exposures and may require additional engineering controlsor different work practices in order to achieve the proposed PELs. To assesswhether these would be feasible for the processes within the industry group,records maintained by OSHA and NIOSH were searched to identify examplesof the successful application of controls to these processes. Based uponthe judgments of the industry experts, a determination was made as to theprobable feasibility of achieving the proposed PELs. A list of the processesand control measures is set out in Table V-4 at the end of this chapter.This chapter presents examples of feasible methods of controlling exposureto hazardous substances encountered in processes used in the SICs for whichcosts and benefits have been identified. Unit costs for these or similarcontrols were used as the basis for the cost projections in Chapter V.In addition, this chapter summarizes the docket entries regarding technologicalfeasibility.Information from commenters to the docket or statements at the hearingsindicate that for the vast majority of firms, the proposed PELs can bemet using engineering controls alone. In the few isolated cases it is recognizedthat respiratory protection must be added to engineering controls to assureworker safety.SIC 20_Food and Kindred ProductsA major air contaminant in the food processing industry is carbon dioxide(CO<T2>2</T2>). A milk products plant (SIC 2023) controlled carbon dioxideexposures by using a hood which fully enclosed the chiller-conveyor lineand exhausted air from the system to an exterior baghouse. Carbon dioxidelevels resulting from the use of dry ice were controlled at a meat packingplant (SICs 2011 and 2013) by a stainless steel exhaust hood. Similarly,a poultry dressing plant controlled carbon dioxide emissions by using aslotted hood exhaust ventilation system. A food processing plant (SIC 202)controlled carbon dioxide exposure by increasing the number of air changesin the packaging room. OSHA is adopting a limit of 10,000 ppm as an 8-hour TWA for CO<T2>2</T2> and is supplementing this limit with a 15-minute STEL of 30,000ppm. The Beer Institute [Ex. 49, 142, Tr. 8/9/88, p. 9-26] and the BrewingIndustry Safety Advisory Committee submitted comments to OSHA on carbondioxide. The industry argued at the public hearing and in docket submittalsthat the 8-hour TWA limit of 5,000 ppm for CO<T2>2</T2> was ``unnecessarily low and restrictive'' [Ex. 49, Tr. 8/9/88,p. 9-27]. According to the Beer Institute, the brewing industry ``is uniquerelative to carbon dioxide exposure and control . . . no other industryfaces the same engineering difficulties for controlling ambient carbondioxide as the brewing industry'' [Tr. 8/9/88]. No details explaining thesedifficulties were provided by these commenters.Monitoring data taken on employees in one brewery, together with a descriptionof the operations that cause the most exposures, are contained in a studyof cellar workers [Riley and Bromberger_Barnes, 1979]. The data includesamples taken over 14 eight-hour shifts. Eight-hour TWA exposures rangedfrom 0.5 percent (5,000 ppm) to 1.41 percent (14,100 ppm), with a meanof 1.08 percent (10,800 ppm). Data on ``maximum acute exposure'' were alsoprovided. The period of maximum acute exposure ranged from 2 minutes to240 minutes. Of the 14 samples, three exceeded a 3-percent (30,000 ppm)    15-minute STEL.Exposures result from a build-up of CO<T2>2</T2> in large fermentation tanks during the beer fermentation process.These tanks are sealed systems; the CO<T2>2</T2> is normally piped away. Two circumstances were identified bycommenters as causing CO<T2>2</T2> exposures. First, if excessive pressure builds up, an escapevalve blows. The concentration of CO<T2>2</T2> in the vicinity of such a blow-out was measured at 60 percent(600,000 ppm), although the level in the area fell to 12 percent (12,000ppm) within a few minutes. Such blow-outs are reportedly rare. The second,and routine source of CO<T2>2</T2> exposure is the opening of tank doors and the entry of workersinto the tank to flush out sludge that remains after the tank has beendrained. After opening the doors which are near the floor and open ontothe central corridor, the cellar worker leaves the area until most of theCO<T2>2</T2> has been ventilated. The principal exposures to CO<T2>2</T2> in the beer industry thus involve either upset conditions (ablow-out) or maintenance activities (entry into the tank to clean it).For both of these circumstances, OSHA routinely permits the use of respiratoryprotection. Exposures in the corridor (resulting from the opening of tankdoors) could be further controlled by the work practice of cracking thedoor and waiting longer before reentering the area or by adding local exhaustventilation to capture the CO<T2>2</T2> escaping from the doors.OSHA notes that commenters from the brewing industry supported the Agency'sproposed STEL for CO<T2>2</T2> of 30,000 ppm [Tr. 8/9/88, p. 9-31], and advocated an 8-hourTWA of 10,000 ppm. In adopting 10,000 ppm as the 8-hour TWA and addinga 15-minute STEL of 30,000 ppm, the Agency believes that feasibility problemsin this industry sector will be alleviated.Grain dust exposures in this sector occur during grain handling operationsin facilities that mill grain either for human use, e.g., flour mills andrice mills or, more commonly, for animal use, e.g., feed mills [Ex. 3-752,p. 10]. There is general agreement that the highest exposures in all typesof grain-handling facilities occur during grain receiving operations [Ex.3-752; Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-46]; the grain receiving process is the same,regardless of the type of facility in which it occurs. OSHA proposed alevel of 4 mg/m\3\ for grain dust; because of feasibility considerations,the final standard is 10 mg/m\3\.Many commenters stated that a PEL of 4 mg/m\3\ was not achievable, particularlyin older mills [Exs. 3-63, 3-110, 3-237, 3-299, 3-405, 3-752, 3-755; Tr.8/10/88, pp. 10-45/10-48; 10-50/10-54; 10-55/10-60; 10-61/10-70]. Industryrepresentatives stated that current employee exposures to grain dust inmills often exceeded the proposed limit [Tr. 8/10/88, pp. 10-63, 10-46;Ex. 180]. For example, David Bossman, representing the American Feed IndustryAssociation (AFIA), reported that ``just over half [of 69 samples takenin 10 mills by the AFIA] exceed the proposed PEL. The average exposurewas 10.9 milligrams per cubic meter'' [Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-46]. Mr. Bossmanalso stated that exposures in the bulk receiving areas of all 10 millssampled exceeded 4 mg/m\3\ and averaged 12.9 mg/m\3\ [Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-46].According to a 1984 study by the T.E. Stivers Organization, 15 of 20 representativemills visited ``had no dust control systems at all, and [the remaining]five had some dust control systems, but [these were] not comprehensivein scope'' [Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-63]. According to Gary Winsett, Presidentof Winsett Engineering, Inc., an independent engineering firm that specializesin the feed, grain, and related agribusiness industries: ``three separatecontrol systems would be required in the main work areas of each mill''to bring 13 of the 20 mills included in this 20-mill survey down to the4 mg/m3 level of control, and six of these 13 mills would require ``relativelyextensive dust control systems in the receiving areas'' to achieve the4 mg/m3 limit [Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-63]. In cases where such controls arein place, however, Mr. Winsett reported that exposures had been reducedconsiderably [Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-62]. In older mills, retrofitting hasbeen successful in reducing grain dust exposure levels. For example, JohnWolgemuth, Corporate Safety and Loss Control Manager for Agway, a farmsupply and food marketing cooperative owned by 102,000 farmer-members,described the results achieved in one mill in which additional exhausthoses had been installed. According to Mr. Wolgemuth, levels were reducedfrom above 15 mg/m3 to below the 10 mg/m3 level by retrofitting [Tr. 8/10/88,pp. 10-50/10-51].In an effort to obtain information on conditions in small, rural mills,OSHA reviewed the docket developed in connection with the Agency's recentgrain-handling standard [Docket H-0117]. A study performed by Dr. Buchanof Colorado State University reported that, in eight small grain elevatorsand feed mills in his state, 10 percent of exposure samples were abovethe 4 mg/m\3\ proposed limit (Attachment 1, Ex. 3-751, Docket H-0117).There are a variety of dust controls in use in grain mills at the presenttime. Dust collection systems, including pneumatic dust controls, are themost widely available and useful methods of controlling grain dust in millsin which dust is a problem [Ex. 3-752, p. 17; Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-62]. Adust collector typically consists of a motor-driven fan, which createsthe air flow necessary to capture dust particles and carry them throughduct work to a dust collector. These aspiration systems are an ``effectivemethod of controlling dust emissions. Aspiration of the leg consists ofa flow of air across the entire boot, which entrains the liberated dustand carries it up the up-leg to take-off points'' (52 <T3>FR </T3>49592, December 31, 1987). Depending on baseline levels ofexposure, several collectors may be needed in a mill.A second method of controlling dust that is becoming widely used is theapplication of oil mist to the grain to minimize dust generation. Thisoil mist, which consists of mineral oil, vegetable oil or some combinationof the two, is normally applied when the grain is received at the mill.Ralph Mourer, testifying for the AFIA, stated that oil suppression of dustis a promising control that he has just installed in his feed mills. Althoughhe has not yet had much experience with the system, he noted ``people I'vetalked [to] and discussed the system with are very pleased'' [Tr. 8/10/88,p. 10-78]. In an earlier study of grain handling facilities for OSHA, however,Arthur D. Little Inc. noted that there are some limitations to the useof this method:Mineral oil is not approved for use as an additive on food grades of grainby the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Vegetable oil may be an allowedadditive, but its use can cause the grain to adhere into masses in coldclimates. Further, there is concern that the oil will become rancid orcreate a commercially objectionable odor (Docket H-0117, ADL, p. VI-34).Scott Bjornsom from Hunter Grain in North Dakota also reported that oilsuppression cannot be used for malting barley ``because of the absorptionwith the water in the malt process'' [Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-85]. Despite somelimitations on its use, oil suppression appears to be an effective control.A third control method that can be used in facilities with high dust exposuresis the use of vacuum systems in place of manual sweeping or compressedair blowing during clean-up operations. A Canadian study [Farant and Moore,``Dust Exposures in the Canadian Grain Industry,'' <T3>American Industrial Hygiene Journal, </T3>March 1978] of grain elevatorsfound that many very high exposures to grain dust were a result of dustraised during housekeeping operations that involved brooms or blowers [Page193, Attachment to Ex. 3-751, Docket H-0117]; this study concluded that``the use of in-plant vacuum systems would reduce these exposures.'' Representativesof the AIFA reported that mills have switched to vacuum systems to controltheir employees' exposures during clean-up [Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-78].Industry representatives also described the filtration systems that arebeing installed on aspiration systems in feed mills; these systems arebeing installed in many areas of mills, expecially in the loading and unloadingareas, where the highest exposures to grain dust occur [Tr. 8/10/88, p.10-73]. In the past, unfiltered cyclones were in widespread use in feedmills [Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-84].To deal with the problem of grain dust in older mills, many owners arereplacing the old-fashioned wooden legs with ``good, tight, enclosed steellegs . . . [and in] old facilities . . . [that had] open grain drag conveyors. . . the conveying systems that used to be open have lids on them . .. to keep the dust where it belongs'' [Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-80]. Enclosureof this type is a standard and recommended industrial hygiene practicein all dusty environments.OSHA notes that much of the control and exposure data relied on by AFIArepresentatives at the hearing, such as the 1984 Stivers study of the representativegroup of 20 feed mills, predates the promulgation of OHHA's grain handlingfacility standard; the Agency believes that many facilities in this sectorare in the process of replacing outdated equipment, retrofitting existingequipment, and ``tightening up all connections'' throughout the mill [Tr.8/10/88, pp. 10-82/10-83]. This is confirmed by industry representatives,who reported that these efforts are being undertaken in response to theOSHA standard, their insurance companies' suggestions, and industry concernsabout dust levels [Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-73]; according to industry representatives,these controls have reduced fire risks [Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-74], improvedproductivity and quality, and led to better working conditions [Tr. 8/10/88,p. 10-81].OSHA's review of all of the evidence in the record indicates that 10 mg/m3is a feasible limit in the grain and feed mill sector. The final rule includesthis PEL as an 8-hour TWA; the Agency finds that the health evidence (seeSection XIC of the preamble to the final rule) demonstrates a significantrisk of material health impairment above this level. OSHA finds that feedmill employers will be able to achieve the 10 mg/m3 limit in cases whereexposures remain above 10 mg/m3 [see [Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-46] or where oldermills are involved [see Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-63] using any of a variety ofcontrols; oil mist suppression in feed mills, aspiration systems (withor without filtration), enclosure of open conveyors and other grain-handlingequipment, and the use of vacuuming in lieu of blowing or sweeping duringcleanup. For some mills that are close to this limit at the present time,OSHA believes that the general ``tightening up'' described by Mr. Wohlgemuth[Tr. 8/10/88, pp. 10-82 to 10-83] will be sufficient.The International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration (IIAR) argued thatthe proposed levels for ammonia (25 ppm TWA, 35 ppm STEL) would be viewedas a nuisance because most people cannot detect the odor of ammonia at35 ppm. As such, employees would neglect proper control measures [Ex. 113].David G. Kramer of Kahn's and Company [Ex. 113] stated that ``No one inour plants is exposed to continuous exposure to 35 ppm ammonia concentrations''.One control approach for ammonia gas encountered in poultry processing(SICs 2016 and 2017) required the appropriate placement of cut-off valvesto freezer coils and the use of an alarm detection system to monitor ambientair conditions.Ammonia-based refrigeration systems are commonly used in the meat productsindustry. Commenters expressed concern that ``ammonia based refrigerationsystems . . . are subject to occasional leaks which may result in short-termhigh level exposures'' [Exs. 3-897, 3-750]. The situation referred to bythese commenters is an intermittent maintenance or upset condition, forwhich OSHA permits the use of respirators. In addition, a representativeof the Food and Allied Services Trade Department of the AFL-CIO statedthat two companies, Wilson Foods and Morrell, evacuate the workplaces ifammonia levels reach 25 ppm as a ceiling [Tr. 8/4/88, p. 311]. In addition,a representative of the Food and Allied Services Trade Department of theAFL-CIO stated that two companies, Wilson Foods and Morrell, evacuate theworkplace if ammonia levels reach 25 ppm as a ceiling [Tr. 8/4/88, p. 311].OSHA concludes that there is no issue of technical feasibility in regardto the proposed STEL of 35 ppm for ammonia and the 35 ppm STEL is retainedin the final rule.Chlorine is used extensively as an antibacterial agent in meat productsplants to comply with USDA sanitation and microbiological contaminationrequirements. Commenters did not raise the issue of technical feasibilityin regard to the proposed chlorine standard itself. Commenters did, however,express concern that a 0.5 ppm STEL for chlorine may be too stringent toallow compliance with USDA regulations [Exs. 3-756, 3-897], although nodata to support this concern were provided. Responding to these concerns,OSHA has established a 0.5 ppm PEL and 1 ppm STEL for chlorine in the finalrule.Carbon disulfide itself is not used in the meat products industry, althoughit is a key solvent used in the manufacture of cellulosic food casings,which are used in the manufacture of processed meats. Suppliers of cellulosicfood casings stated that a carbon disulfide standard of 1 ppm cannot bemet in the production of such casings [Exs. 3-421, 3-633, and 3-896]; ifthis were the case, according to these commenters, domestic supplies ofcellulosic casings would cease. Foreign supplies would gradually penetrateand supply the market for cellulosic food casings [Tr. 8/2/88, pp. 4-209,and 4-261]. OSHA concludes that there is no apparent issue of technicalfeasibility of the proposed carbon disulfide standard in SIC 20. However,the TWA for this substance has been increased to 4 ppm, in part, in considerationof the potential industrial displacement effect.The National Cotton Council of America (NCCA) submitted a comment to theeffect that the approximately 50 cotton mills in SIC 2074 would be adverselyaffected by the proposed limit for n-hexane and other hexane isomers, vegetableoil mist, and grain dust [Ex. 3-1080]. NCCA stated that its members wouldhave difficulty measuring airborne concentrations of these substances becausecottonseed mills are small, rural business without in-house industrialhygiene capability. OSHA notes, however, that methods are readily availableto measure these airborne contaminants; an appendix to the final rule containsinformation on appropriate sampling methods for these substances. The Agencyhas responded to industry concerns by dropping its proposed 10 mg/m3 STELfor oil mist but retaining the 5 mg/mg\3\ TWA.Sulfur dioxide (SO<T2>2</T2>) exposures in the wet corn milling industry as a result fromsoaking of cleaned corn kernels in large vats (known as steep vats) for30 to 50 hours. The purpose of the steeping process is to soften the cornin preparation for further grinding, screening, and centrifugal operations.This steeping process takes place in a dilute sulfur dioxide solution (sulfurousacid) [Tr. 8/15/88, pp. 9-10]. Worker exposures occur when sulfur dioxideis released from solution in the steeping tanks. The principal controlsavailable to reduce exposures to sulfur dioxide are local exhaust ventilation,the use of isolated control rooms, process enclosure achieved by the useof closed stainless steel tanks, enclosed screening systems, and generalautomation [Tr. 8/15/88, pp. 8-77 to 8-78].Exposure data for this segment of SIC 20 are sparse, except for data froma study conducted by the CRA in five of its member plants in 1977 in connectionwith the Agency's earlier SO<T2>2</T2> rulemaking. Eight-hour TWA samples were taken on 213 workersexposed to SO<T2>2</T2> in wet corn milling and on a group of 344 non-SO<T2>2</T2>-exposed workers from other parts of the plant [Ex. 65, Tab 9].(The ``background'' SO<T2>2</T2> level even for the controls, however, was determined to be 0.33ppm (8-hour TWA).) The median exposure in the SO<T2>2</T2> group was 2 ppm; 15 percent of all workers were exposed above5 ppm. No STEL measurements were taken. Exposures (8-hour TWAs) rangedfrom 0.1 to 10.8 ppm. According to industry sources, these results ``representworst-case'' exposures because they were obtained during the winter months,when the plants' windows and doors were closed [Ex. 65, Tab 9, p. 7]. Morerecent exposure data, described at the hearing as ``non-systematic'' andvariable in ``sampling efforts, methods and results,'' were summarizedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">While many plants report 1987-88 personal sampling results in therange of 2 ppm, even plants in that category are not below 2 ppm consistently,and a large number of employees are still exposed in the range of 4 to5 ppm.</ITAG>Industry representatives at the hearing indicated that opening the doorsand windows even when there was only a 5-mph breeze outside increased theeffectiveness of in-plant ventilation by a factor of five [Ex. 65, Attach.D, pp. 2392-2397]. In addition, testimony indicates that the higher 8-hourTWA readings and those above 10 ppm were caused by ``emergencies,'' ``pipesbreaking, or the process getting out of control, the tank . . . [overflowing]as a pump seal breaks, or something of that sort'' [Ex. 65, Attach. D,pp. 2314, 2315, 2319]. Testimony also indicates that many of the samplingresults reported above were taken on maintenance workers, who are personneldedicated to maintenance functions [Tr. 8/8/88, p. 8-85].Industry representatives reported that major improvements in SO<T2>2</T2> exposures could be achieved:<ITAG tagnum="21">Plants vary widely in age, the degree of natural ventilation available,the degree to which their process is entirely closed, the location andsource of the sulfur dioxide they use in steeping, the amount of localexhaust equipment already in place, the extent to which control rooms isolatethe operator from the process, and various other factors [Ex. 65, Attach.F, pp. 35, 37].</ITAG>Some equipment, such as the ``steeps'' or soaking tanks, are more than40 years old; some of these tanks are still the wooden staved steeps ofyears ago [Ex. 65, Attach. D, p. 2324]. One company has milling plantsthat range from 30 to 97 years in age [Ex. 65, Attach. D, p. 2324]. Spokesmenreported that the industry's efforts to modernize plants has not resultedin appreciably lower employee SO<T2>2</T2> exposures because improvements in engineering controls, i.e.,ventilation, have not kept up with increased production [Ex. 65, Tab 13,p. 7]. An OSHA-sponsored study performed by JRB Associates for the previousSO<T2>2</T2> rulemaking found that plants in this sector could achieve the2-ppm TWA and 5-ppm STEL with the expenditure of a relatively small amountof money [Ex. 65, Attach. D, pp. 2322-2324].There are no sampling data in the record relating to the 5-ppm STEL forSO<T2>2</T2>, because the CRA-sponsored exposure survey undertaken in 1977contained no STEL sampling results. The recent record [Ex. 65, Tab 13,p. 7] states simply that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Short term exposures, especially for maintenance job functions, canbe considerably higher than 4 to 5 ppm [Ex. 65, Tab 13, p. 7].</ITAG>OSHA notes, however that the wet corn milling process is a steady-stateprocess:<ITAG tagnum="21">The process . . . is rather level as far as the [SO<T2>2</T2>] concentration is concerned with the exception of emergencies,pipes breaking, or the process getting out of control . . . (Ex. 65, Attach,D, p. 2314-2315) . . . [except] for maintenance emergency problems, theexposure to sulfur dioxide in the process is fairly constant.</ITAG>OSHA finds that the 2-ppm 8-hour TWA and the 5 ppm 15-minute STEL for sulfurdioxide are technologically feasible in the wet corn-milling process.<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) In 1977, 50 percent of all SO<T2>2</T2>-exposed employees had exposures at or below 2 ppm; because thesampling results for dedicated maintenance employees are contained in thesenumbers, the actual percentage is greater than 50 percent for non-maintenanceworkers;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Most of the sampling results from the high end of the 0.8 to 10.8ppm range of exposures cited by the CRA occurred during process upset ormaintenance operations;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The 1977 CRA sampling results were ``worst case,'' so the numberof overexposed employees is overstated; respirators are permitted in theseoperations;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Because most exposures are already below 2 ppm, little in theway of additional control will be needed (note that opening the windowsincreased the efficiency of ventilation by a factor of 5, indicating thatadditional make-up air would do the same);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) STEL exposures are not a problem because the wet milling process,except when it is not being adequately controlled, is characterized, accordingto industry representatives, by relatively constant, non-fluctuating ambientconcentrations of SO<T2>2</T2>. Because most exposures are already below 2 ppm and the overwhelmingmajority are now at or below 5 ppm, the STEL has essentially been achievedin this sector. That is, in a steady-state exposure environment where 8-hourTWA exposures are below 5 ppm, 5 ppm STEL exposures are not a problem.In wet corn milling, short-term exposures are a problem only in maintenanceand emergency operations; in both cases, respirators are both permittedand encouraged by OSHA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) Where exposures are above 2 ppm, they are only slightly above2 ppm. Minor upgrades in ventilation and some modernization of the oldestequipment will reduce exposures below 2 ppm.</ITAG>SIC 21_Tobacco ProductsTobacco dust and residual pesticide dusts created during cutting and shreddingoperations have been reduced through the use of local exhaust ventilation.This has also been used to control emissions of ethyl alcohol-based chemicalflavorings during blending operations.There were no comments submitted to the docket for this sector.SIC 22_Textile Mill ProductsTextiles are dyed at various stages in their manufacture, including unspunfibers, unwoven yarn, and finished fabric. Workers who prepare fabricsfrom unspun fibers are of particular concern, since they could be potentiallyexposed to dyes contained on dusts generated during manufacture. In addition,some dyes possess much poorer fastness to wet treatment than do others;persons who launder such clothing are potentially exposed to the dyes.Stringent control measures and work practices can prevent such exposure.Several generally acceptable practices for the control of hazardous materialscan be used wherever there is the potential for exposure. For example,pressure failure alarms for closed systems and exhaust ventilation canrapidly indicate a system failure that might result in the release of substantialquantities of dyes. Continuous flow indicators, such as water or oil manometersproperly mounted at the juncture of a fume hood and duct throat and markedto indicate acceptable airflow, will give a readily observable indicationof decreased efficiency in the ventilation system for the hood. Wet methods,vacuum cleaning, or other methods that do not lead to redispersion of settleddust should be used for plant maintenance and sanitation. Dry sweepingor blowing with compressed air should be prohibited.Evidence presented in the docket suggest that controls necessary to meetthe proposed standards have already been installed at many facilities.The American Textile Manufacturers Institute, Inc. (ATMI), representing85 percent of the industry's manufacturing capacity, reported that ``membercompanies generally try to meet the ACGIH TLVs for both those chemicalswhich are regulated by PELs and those which are not. Because the ACGIHTLVs are annually reviewed and revised, ATMI's member companies believecompliance with these voluntary standards has led to safer and healthierworkplaces for their employees'' [Ex. 3-434].The National Cotton Council of America [Ex. 3-1080] reported that ``Textilemanufacturers generally try to use the existing ACGIH TLVs as guidelinesfor good practice to provide a safer and healthier workplace for theiremployees.'' Their comments state that some of the levels are difficultto attain, but are said to be feasible.SIC 23_ApparelChemical exposures in the apparel industry occur principally as a resultof three exposure sources: spot cleaning, dry cleaning and contact withtreated fabrics.Spot cleaning and dry cleaning operations exposures to perchloroethylenecan be controlled with the use of local exhaust ventilation and generalventilation. Work practice improvements help reduce solvent exposure duringtransfer operations. Routine scheduled maintenance can be used to detectand control leaks from door gaskets and seals. Contact dermatitis is reducedthrough the use of disposable gloves and adherence to a personal hygieneprogram.A detailed discussion of perchloroethylene is presented in SIC 72.SIC 24_Lumber and Wood The primary worker exposure in the lumber and wood industry is wood dust.For the operation of large equipment (e.g. in debarking and sawmill activities),the operator can be placed in an enclosed control booth, or in the caseof moving equipment (e.g. cherry pickers, loaders and cranes), the operatorcan be located in an enclosed cab. In both cases, air would be filteredand conditioned. In the case of felting or matting process lines, or suchequipment as belt sanders, the equipment can be enclosed or hooded andvented to a baghouse. For smaller equipment, such as variety saws, tenoners,and dovetailers, hoods or various types of negative pressure (or combinationsof positive and negative pressure) local ventilation devices can be usedto control wood dust. In the case of hand-held sanders, a vacuum systemcan sometimes be applied to the process. Some other wood dust generatingequipment can also be enclosed (e.g. planers), but this is generally donefor noise control.The technical feasibility of a 5 mg/m3 PEL for wood dust was challenged,indirectly, by only one commenter to the record. The American FurnitureManufacturers Association [Ex. 3-917], after speaking of the general technicalfeasibility of the proposed standard and the difficulty of controllingwood dust around some machines, stated: ``Other machines are so complicated(such as multiple spindle boring machines and multiple spindle carvers)that no effective collection system has yet been defined.'' OSHA disagreesand concludes that exposures on these machines can be controlled. Includedin the documentation of the site visits conducted for this rulemaking [Ex.11] is at least one case of a multiple head boring machine which was equippedwith local exahust ventilation and a multiple spindle ``trim, bore anddowel'' machine also equipped with local exhaust ventilation. TWA exposuresto wood dust for the operators of these machines were 1.0 and 0.4 mg/m3,respectively.Vast numbers of commenters expressed their support for a 5 mg/m3 PEL forwood dust without any question of technological feasibility. A few examplesfollow. Appalachian Hardwood Manufacturers, Inc. [Ex. 3-626] stated that,although they felt it would be expensive, ``To bring all our mills intocompliance with a five milligram per cubic meter standard would be technicallyfeasible.'' Monadnock Forest Products, Inc. [Ex. 127, Attachment C andTr. 8/12/88, p. 216] states that ``5 mg/m3 is technically feasible butdue to cost it should be phased in over a number of years.'' The NationalDimension Manufacturers Association [Ex. 3-1160] commented: ``Achievementof a 5 mg/m3 permissible exposure limit [for wood dust] is believed tobe technically feasible. . . .'' Others at the hearings supporting theadoption of the 5 mg/m3 level included David Smith of Willamette Industries[Tr. 8/12/88, p. 369] and Charles Carey of Ross Associates [Tr. 8/12/88,p. 411]. Whirlpool Corporation [Ex. 3-824] provided exposure data for asanding work station, before and after the installation of control equipment.Exposures before the ventilation equipment was installed ranged from 13.0to 29.6 mg/m3. With the equipment in place, exposures ranged from 0.88to 3.16 mg/m3.Two surveys cited by Mr. Scott Schneider of the Workers' Institute forSafety and Heath [Tr. 8/15/88, p. 6 and Ex. 115, Attachment A] also supportthe feasibility of the 5 mg/m3 PEL. A 1986 OSHA Health Response Team surveyshowed that ``two thirds of the personal samples were below two milligramsper cubic meter and over 40 percent were below one.'' Twelve of the 23plants in a 1985 survey by Haliday Associates in Ontario, Canada, had noexposures over five milligrams per cubic meter and two of the plants, oneof which was a furniture plant, had no exposures above one milligram percubic meter.Exposure data from the Clayton Environmental Consultants' study for theInter-Industry Wood Dust Coordinating Committee was cited by Mr. MichaelCoffman at the informal public hearings [Tr. 8/12/88, p. 99]. Mr. Coffmanstated: ``Within SIC code 24, we collected a total of 676 dust measurements.Eight percent of these were found to exceed five milligrams per cubic meter;30 percent exceeded one milligram per cubic meter. Within SIC Code 25,107 total dust measurements were collected. Fifteen percent of these exceededfive milligrams per cubic meter, 40 percent exceeding one milligram percubic meter. Within SIC Code 26, a total of 19 measurements were collected,five percent exceeding both one and five milligrams per cubic meter.''Exposure data presented by machine type in the Clayton study [Ex. 127A],and shown below in Table F-1, provide clear evidence that the 5 mg/m\3\level can be attained for many machines by using local exhaust ventilation.These data demonstrate that exposures of operators at these machines canbe uniformly controlled. Table F-2 presents data showing the effectivenessof ventilation and air-conditioned booths for other machines.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) O 1722</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C  </ITAG>A number of commenters also estimated what their costs of compliance wouldbe if a 5 mg/m\3\ standard were adopted (specific examples are addressedin Chapter G). Estimating the costs implies the technical feasibility ofmeeting the standard. All of the foregoing is evidence that control ofwood dust at or below 5 mg/m\3\ is technologically feasible. Washington State has adopted exposure limits of 2.5 mg/m\3\ for westernred cedar and 5 mg/m\3\ for other woods. According to Mr. Stephen Cantof the Occupational Health Program for the State of Washington, ``. . .in our process of adopting this specific wood dust standard the industrypresented absolutely no comment in terms of concerns regarding the limits''[Tr. 7/29/88, p. 102]. Mr. Cant also states: ``. . . Industry has beencomfortable with [these] limits in the northwest. We find that they can,in fact, in most cases comply with those limits, . . . .'' A study conducted by the University of Washington Department of EnvironmentalHealth [Ex. 127H] provides recommendations on achieving the 2.5 mg percubic meter level, as well as some exposure data. The report notes thataverage exposures for shake saw operators in the mills surveyed were 1.63mg/m\3\. The range of exposures for other mill workers (splittermen, deckhands and packers) ranged from 0.22 to 2.7 mg/m3. Shingle saw operatorswere the only workers routinely exposed at levels above the 2.5 mg/m\3\limit, with average exposures of 3.84 mg/m\3\. From this study: ``The Washingtonexposure levels can be compared to levels in Canadian sawmills after tenyears of a Canadian regulatory limit of 2.5 mg/m\3\. Cedar dust levelswere studied in Canadian sawmills in 1985 by a researcher named Vedal.Total dust exposure in observed Canadian mills ranged from undetectableto 6.0 mg/m\3\ averaged over an 8-hour work day, with an average dust exposureof 0.21 mg/m\3\. Only 10 percent of workers were exposed to more than 1.0mg/m\3\, and of these only 3.9 percent had exposures greater than 2.0 mg/m\3\TWA.'' Included in the University of Washington report are a number ofspecific designs for local ventilation, baffles for shake and shingle sawsand general recommendations on housecleaning. SIC 25_Furniture The feasibility of the standard for wood dust in this SIC is discussedin conjunction with SIC 24, above. A review of processes in the metal office furniture manufacturing sector(SIC 2522), shows that air contaminants from the coating process have beencontrolled. Prefabricated sheet components for file cabinets are prewashedand coated with polyester or acrylic on a high speed conveyor line. Theapplication process includes manual spraying of cabinets with airless atomizingsprayers and electrostatic spray guns on reciprocators. Manual sprayingoperations are performed in downdraft booths. Filtered fresh air is suppliedthrough the open top of the booths and removed at the bottom through awater curtain by exhaust fans mounted on the roof of the booth. Spray headersin exhaust plenums clear paint mist from the air stream. Automatic spraybooths contain electrostatic spray guns and side draft ventilation. Furthermore,organic solvent vapors in the paint mixing and storage room are controlledby equipping each drum with a heavy barrel cover, an integral agitator,sealed pipe openings, and a closeable access line. Masco Corporation [Ex. 3-682]: ``Methodologies for control of solventsfrom finishes in the woodworking industry are limited. . . . OSHA thereforehas presented no feasible methodology for the woodworking component ofthe furniture industry to control solvent or potential gaseous air toxics.''OSHA concludes that control is feasible. The control for such potentialexposures is, in almost all applications of lacquers, varnishes, sealersand stains, a form of local exhaust ventilation control commonly referredto as a spray booth. Spray booths are in wide use in the furniture industry and were seen inuse at several of the plants on the site visits conducted for this rulemakinganalysis [Ex. 11]. In each case the exposures were far below the PELs,and in several cases the solvent levels were not detectable. A NIOSH study [TA 79-047-825] recommends that the exhaust opening in apainting room should be located as close to the painting operation as possibleto take advantage of spot ventilation. The exhaust opening location shouldbe such that overspray is directed into the opening. The exhaust outletshould be placed so that all the air used for ventilation passes throughthe zone of contamination. The air flow should direct all contaminantsaway from the painter's breathing zone and into the exhaust outlet. Most welding in furniture manufacturing occurs in a fixed location whereexposures to the various components of welding fumes can best be controlledwith adequate local ventilation. Numerous manufacturers have availablelocal exhaust systems and source collection/filtration systems that willcontrol welding fumes. These systems typically consist of a fan and eithera fixed hood or a jointed, flexible arm, up to fifteen feet in length,at the end of which is a small hood. The flexible arm allows the exhaustsystem to cover a large work area. Such systems operate at air volumesof 400 to 1000 cfm and can be exhausted to an existing centralized ventilationsystem, to the vicinity of general shop ventilation (e.g., a roof fan)or directly to the outside. A wide variety of off-the-shelf local exhaustsystems and collection filtration systems are available, including portablemodels. Custom ventilation systems can also be installed. SIC 26_Paper and Allied ProductsPulp mills occur primarily in SIC 2611, but can also be present as partof the operations in SICs 2621 and 2631. High control costs could potentiallybe incurred because of the larger quantities of chemicals used in breakingdown pulp to form cellulose and the reactions that occur in the digestingprocess between these chemicals and the substances contained in the woodfiber. Large quantities of chemicals such as chlorine and sodium hydroxideare also used in the bleaching operations. The digesting and bleachingoperations are also very extensive. Large quantities of pulp are generallyproduced from wood in these mills either for captive use or for shipmentto paper and paperboard mills. The type of controls that would be usedinclude ventilation, enclosure and/or process change, but less likely thelatter. Various engineering controls have been used by the paper mill industryto prevent the mixing of toxic chemicals in sewer lines. Tanks containingthe hazardous chemicals have been isolated and surrounded by dikes. Dischargelines have been re-routed to prevent accidental mixing. OSHA believes thatfeasible controls are available.Wood dust can be generated in some processes in pulp mills in SICs 2611,2621, and 2631. Workers may be exposed to wood dust from debarking andchipping operations, as well as in the wood yard. Exposures to equipmentoperators in the wood yard can be controlled by installing enclosed, air-conditionedcabs on the equipment. Debarker operators are frequently protected by isolutionin air-conditioned booths. Exposure data for debarkers included in theClayton study of the Inter-Industry Wood Dust Coordinating Committee showonly 2 of 21 measurements above the 5 mg/m\3\ level. Data for chippers,also from the Clayton study, suggest that controls are rarely needed forchippers: Only one of the 13 exposure measurements for chippers that hadno controls in place was in excess of 5 mg/m\3\. Based on all of the above,OSHA concludes that controls are feasible for this industry.SIC 27_Printing and PublishingThe technological feasibility for the proposed standards for toluene waschallenged by R.R. Donnelley and Sons (Ex. 3-916). ``Donnelley believesthat compliance with the proposed 150 ppm ceiling will be infeasible duringcertain press operations and especially during cleaning.'' Donnelley furtherstate that ``if the 100 ppm standard is achieved at great cost throughgeneral ventilation improvements, compliance with the 150 ppm 15-minuteceiling would be impossible without the use of local ventilation or respirators.''The main concern of this discussion becomes apparent by the following remarks.``If, as proposed by the regulation, respirators cannot be used six monthsafter the effective date of the regulation, local ventilation is the onlyoption. Given the number of presses in service at Donnelley's plants .. . the proposed 150 ppm ceiling will require, at a minimum, a maze ofventilation equipment which can be expected to cost millions of dollars.''These statements reflect the costliness of achieving the proposed standardsfor toluene in this firm but acknowledge that engineering controls arefeasible. The commenter apparently misunderstood the discussion (<T4>Federal Register</T4>, Vol. 3, 6/7/88, pp. 21241, 2), on the proposedlength of time for firms to achieve compliance under the hierarchy of controls.OSHA also believes that there are substitute solvents available such asethanol, ethyl acetate or nitroethane that could be used in cleaning operationsor water-based inks not requiring major solvent use that could enable printingfirms to achieve compliance with the final PELs. In addition, OSHA believesthat engineering controls in the form of local exhaust ventilation aretechnologically feasible for press applications in the printing industry.Site visits and monitoring were conducted to two printing establishments(Ex. 11_Firms 14, 45). One was a letterpress and lithographic operationand the other was a ``quick-print'' shop. In neither case were there overexposuresto any of the following chemicals in use: Antimony and compounds, dipropyleneglycol methyl ether, ethylene glycol vapor, hexane isomers (other thann-hexane), n-hexane, naphtha, potassium hydroxide, propylene glycol monomethylether, sodium hydroxide, stoddard solvent (mineral spirits), tetrachloroethylene,and inorganic tin compounds (except oxides).SIC 28_Chemicals and Allied ProductsIn its research on technological feasibility, OSHA found the followingexamples of controls currently in use:andbullet; The plastic materials and resins manufacturing sector (SIC 2821)used a tank with a hinged cover and fixed ductwork as an exhaust when dumpingdye and additives into hot methanol.andbullet; Dust exposure during the bag opening operation in paint manufacturing(SIC 2851) was controlled by modifying the hood to increase dust capture.Likewise, a new dust collection system (collection hoods) with increasedcapture velocity was installed for use in the bagging and packaging ofpesticides (SIC 287).andbullet; Pharmaceutical manufacturers (SIC 2824) addressed the problemof nuisance dust particles by fitting vacuum crescents and elephant trunkson point sources, by fitting chutes with covers, and by placing vacuumattachments on receiving drum covers. Additionally, monitoring was performedfrom an outside room.andbullet; In order to reduce employee exposure to sulfur dioxide while producingsulfur dioxide gas (SIC 2819), sample collection units were enclosed andattached to a fume collection system. Sample waste was recycled to preventopen exposure in process areas. Electronic spent acid interface detectorswere installed to eliminate the need for employee visual inspection ofintermittently pulled samples.andbullet; To control TDI exposure in urethane foam manufacturing (SIC 2822),the bun conveyor was enclosed and exhausted. Employee exposure was limitedto the startup and finish procedures when installing and removing bun support.A mechanism was designed to support the bun, which eliminated the needfor it to be done manually.In addition, OSHA looked at controls used in paint manufacturing processes.The production of paints (SIC 2851) is a batch procedure which involvesthe following steps: prebatching, mixing, dispersing, tinting and shading,filling, and storage or shipping. When prebatching or mixing, an employeewill slit a bag of dry pigment with a knife and either scoop out the contentsfor weighing or dump the pigment into the mixer. In some cases, pigmentsare received in a slurry form and are piped directly into the mixer. Solventsand other raw materials are added into the mixer. Once combined, the mixtureis in a paste or slurry form. This mixture is then thoroughly dispersedin a roller, ball, or sand mill or a high-speed disperser all of whichare generally closed processes. The paste is transferred to a storage tankwhere thinning or other agents are added. The paint is later drawn off,filtered and packaged in cans or drums. Airborne dust exposures to componentsin dry pigments occur during the prebatching and mixing operations whenthe bags of pigments are opened and dumped. Exposure to chemicals in drypigments can also occur from pigment spillage and empty bag flatteningand disposal. Once the batch is in solution in the mixer, there are nofurther dust emission points. Exposure to solvents can occur during additionof these ingredients to the mixing tanks, during any leaks or spills, andduring packaging.Local exhaust ventilation would be used to control exposures to dusts andfumes in the paint production processes. Pigment dust exposures at thedumping station can be controlled with the use of a vented enclosure keptunder negative pressure by a ventilation system. Empty bags would be manuallyejected through a side opening into a large plastic disposal bag to mimimizedust generation during bag flattening and disposal. Exposures to solvents would be minimized with the use of portable hoodsattached to flexible ductwork. These ventilation hoods could be placedover the liquid dumping process and also the packaging operation if thepercentage and volatility of the solvents would result in exposures. Observations and judgments proffered by various chemical industry representativesand associations indicate general compliance with the PELs. Such statementsindicating widespread compliance demonstrate the existence of availableand practicable control methods for a number of chemicals and processes.Technological feasibility in SIC 28 for most of the proposed PELs is notchallenged in the record. Comments received from ARCO [Ex. 3-740] state:``In general, the petrochemical industry has been using the ACGIH TLVsas the primary workplace exposure guideline for years.'' This statementimplies that most of the PELs are not only feasible but are currently beingmet. Dr. Isadore Rosenthal has stated on behalf of Rohm and Haas Company that``experience and data tell us that it is feasible for our company to achievethe ACGIH TLV workplace exposures. This takes time to accomplish, however,and therefore a phased in approach to controls is necessary. The periodof time in which a firm has to achieve exposure controls should begin onlyafter OSHA has certified a feasible analytical method'' for determinationof exposure [Tr. 8/1/88, pp. 15-16]. The Polyurethane Manufacturers Association (PMA), in expressing supportfor the proposed PEL for 4,4andmin16;-methylene bis(2-chloroaniline), alsodiscussed the feasibility of achieving the proposed level of control [Ex.3-683]. PMA stated that ``. . . the various control technologies and personalprotective equipment for these various situations [where exposures occur]is recognized in the industry. . .'' . Representatives of the PMA alsotestified that they believe the industry can comply [Tr. 8/9/88, pp. 83and 91]. Feasibility of controlling exposures to talc dust was indicated by theremarks of the R.T. Vanderbilt Company [Ex. 3-108]: ``We would agree withthe ACGIH that dust control has all but eliminated the excess death ratesin the talc industry. We also support the 2 mg/m3 respirable talc duststandard.'' Vanderbilt apparently foresees no difficulty in controllingtalc dust at the new PEL. The feasibility of the proposed 50 ppm PEL for styrene was asserted bythe Dow Chemical Company in its comments to the record [Ex. 3-741]: ``Dowmanufactures styrene and uses styrene in several processes including themanufacture of styrene polymers and polyester resins. These operationscan be controlled to reduce exposures below the proposed PEL of 50 ppmand, in fact, most Dow operations already operate at less than 50 ppm.''The Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance (HSIA) expressed some concernabout the feasibility of the proposed 2 ppm 60-minute STEL for carbon tetrachloride[Exs. 3-873, 8-86, 186], but did not identify specific areas where compliancemight be infeasible. HSIA also stated ``Since carbon tetrachloride is generallyused as a process solvent or raw material, workplace exposures are quitelow, generally, we believe, below the ACGIH TLV of 5 ppm.'' Dow Chemicalidentified specific tasks and operations such as sampling, loading andunloading, and maintenance where they felt that compliance might be difficultor impossible [Ex. 3-741]. Similar concerns were raised about the feasibility of the proposed 2 ppmSTEL for chloroform. HSIA anticipated ``that non-chemical industry users.. . would find a 2-ppm limit infeasible in some cases'' [Ex. 3-873, 8-86,186]. The only tasks or processes specifically mentioned in the recordas potential problem areas for carbon tetrachloride and chloroform aresampling, loading and unloading, and maintenance [Dow Chemical Company,Ex. 3-741]. These three tasks were named by Dow as problem areas for ethylenedichloride, as well. Hoffman-LaRoche Corporation stated that ``. . . one of the most significantproblems associated with the use of chloroform is its high vapor pressurewhich makes it extremely difficult to contain during processing. Althoughcompliance with the ACGIH TLV of 10 ppm would be difficult to achieve,the proposed NIOSH REL of 2 ppm would, in our opinion, be technologicallyinfeasible'' [Ex. 3-749]. Chloroform is manufactured in a gas phase reaction at temperatures rangingfrom 350 to 750 anddegrees;C. The major use of chloroform, production ofchlorofluoromethanes, also involves reactions carried out at elevated temperaturesand pressures. These reactions must be performed in a completely closedsystem, so routine exposures should be minimal. Given the nature of theproduction process and the primary use of chloroform, together with theabsence of comments from other manufacturers regarding exposures duringprocessing, OSHA concludes that the 2 ppm PEL is technologically feasible.OSHA recognizes that brief exposure levels of over 2 ppm can be encounteredduring loading and unloading operations of carbon tetrachloride and chloroform.However, OSHA concludes that the 8-hour TWA PELs of 2 ppm for chloroformand carbon tetrachloride are feasible. Reduction of emissions from tankcar and tank wagon openings can be achieved with the use of engineeringcontrols such as vapor recovery systems. Workers should be exposed onlyfor extremely brief periods when attaching or disconnecting lines duringloading or unloading operations. Training in and use of proper work practices,in conjunction with proper maintenance or replacement of valves and couplingscan reduce both levels and duration of exposures. The laboratory analysis of samples should be performed under a hood. Overexposuresduring the collection of samples can be prevented by the installation ofsampling boxes if adjustments in work practices are insufficient. BecauseOSHA allows the use of respirators to prevent overexposures during maintenanceactivities, feasibility of engineering controls is not a problem for theseintermittent activities. The Vinyl Institute [Ex. 3-624] asserted that modifications would be requiredto the tank farm vent controls in ``a typical EDC/VCM [ethylene dichloride/vinylchloride monomer] plant . . . to comply with the proposed regulation forEDC.'' OSHA concludes that significant exposures will not occur under ordinaryconditions in a tank farm because workers are not normally stationed there.The Vinyl Institute also asserted that increased down time of plants wouldbe necessary to clean process equipment of EDC before maintenance workcould be performed on that equipment. Because OSHA allows the use of personalprotective equipment for maintenance activities, no additional down timeor problem of feasibility from this standpoint should be encountered. The Dow Chemical Company [Ex. 3-741] and the Chemical Manufacturers Association[Ex. 3-874] asserted that the 1 ppm TWA for ethylene dichloride may notbe feasible in maintenance, sampling, and loading. OSHA believes that thereare engineering controls which can control exposures at these specificoperations. However, if engineering and work practice controls cannot reduceexposures to the new PEL, respirators would be allowed. The feasibility of controlling exposures to carbon disulfide in rayon manufacturingwas questioned by the North American Rayon Corporation [Ex. 3-415] andthe Inter-Industry Committee on Carbon Disulfide [Ex. 3-174]. The overexposuresare said to occur only when ``the windows and hoods are raised to allowaccess to the machine.'' The three tasks for which opening the hoods arenecessary are for changing spinerettes, for removing filament bundles andto meet product line changes [BASF Corporation, Fibers Division, Exs. 3-674,125]. BASF claims that in these areas, ambient workroom air cannot be reducedto 1 ppm as a TWA or 10 ppm as a STEL [Ex. 125]. Rayburn H. Dean, BASFGroup Vice President, stated that at other times and in all other areasof the plant, exposures are below 1 ppm, although he refused to providemonitoring data on the grounds that it is proprietary [Tr. 8/2/88, pp.157-159]. Mr. Dean also explaind that, referring to the cutting area, ``Wehave some TV monitoring there so that fewer people are in that area. Whenthey are, we have installed this special air conditioned room that youmade reference to earlier, down in the spinning room'' [Tr. 8/2/88, p.151]. Manufacturers already have ``NIOSH approved respirators that mustbe used'' any time there is a short-term excursion above 20 ppm. [Tr. 8/2/88,p. 136]. ``The respirator is the only control available in these threeroutine operations, to prevent consistent and repeated exposure of theworkers to carbon disulfide'' [Ex. 125]. OSHA realizes the complexity ofthis process situation and concludes that the use of respirators duringthe three aforementioned situations will permit the highest level of protectionto workers. Dow Chemical [Ex. 3-741] and the Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance[Ex. 3-873] questioned the feasibility of the proposed trichloroethylene(TCE) PEL of 25 ppm in degreasing operations. OSHA concludes that exposuresin degreasing can be controlled at the final level of 50 ppm and that exposuredata support this position. Both commenters provided information whichindicated that, in 1974, 37 percent of open-top degreasers using TCE couldmaintain 25 ppm and a European estimate from 1980 stated that 50 percentof open-top degreasers and 60-65 percent of closed degreasers could meeta 25 ppm standard. OSHA believes that a considerable amount of overexposurein degreasing is due to inadequate engineering controls or insufficientattention paid to the problem of solvent ``carryout.'' The addition ofcontrols such as chillers, lip exhaust, drying tunnels and covers willreduce personal and ambient exposure levels. Control of chlorine exposures to the proposed 0.5 ppm ceiling was expectedby Dow Chemical Company [Ex. 3-741] to require increased use of respiratorsby employees engaged in some tasks. Referring to the current PEL of a 1ppm ceiling, Dow stated: ``We have been able to achieve this degree ofcontrol in our Cl<T2>2</T2> plants and in the majority of our normal work situations sothat respiratory protection is needed only in a limited number of short-termsituations.'' Only one area where these situations occur was mentioned:magnesium production. A NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation [No. 75-113-249]found a median exposure level of 0.16 ppm for 19 operators's breathingzone samples in a magnesium extraction and chlorination operation. A secondNIOSH report [No. 79-40-1381] found a median of 0.2 ppm for 54 samplestaken at a chlorine production facility. Only 17 percent of these samplesexceeded 0.5 ppm. OSHA concludes that these studies, and the fact thattechnological infeasibility was not claimed for any specific operations,indicate technological feasibility of a 0.5 ppm TWA PEL and 1.0 ppm STELfor chlorine and that few, if any, additional measures will be necessaryto meet these limits. The manufacturers of cellulose acetate, Tennessee Eastman and Hoechst-Celanese,asserted that the proposed PEL of 250 ppm for acetone is not technologicallyfeasible by means of engineering controls [Exs. 128, 149, 8-54]. Four employeecategories were specifically identified in testimony as situations wherecompliance by engineering controls would be infeasible: filtration workers,dope operators, spinning machine operators and doffers, and parts washing.While the manufacturers stressed the importance of using acetone as theprocess solvent, substitute solvents, such as ethyl acetate, could be foundfor parts washing. In activities such as parts washing, the solvent cannotaffect fiber quality, but need only dissolve the cellulose acetate. Filtration workers at a Kingsport, Tennessee plant dress four or five presseseach twelve hour work day [Tr. 8/4/88, p. 142]. According to Mr. JosephMorton of Tennessee Eastman, ``Each press dressing requires about 45 minutesto remove dirty filter media and 45 minutes to apply clean filter media.''Assuming that exposures are significant only during the removal of dirtyfilter media, this would amount to three to four hours of exposure per12-hour shift. Mr. Morton also observes that ``exposure levels of filtrationworkers frequently are in the range of 500 to 700 parts per million'' [Tr.8/4/88, p. 142]. Exposure monitoring data submitted by the Chemical ManufacturersAssociation Ketones Program Panel showed filtration workers exposed acrossa wide range of levels: Four of the 25 samples were in the range 500-750ppm, 12 of the 25 were 250-500 ppm, and the remaining 9 were below 250ppm. These data clearly suggest that exposure of filtration workers canbe controlled at levels below 750 ppm. Because these samples were takenfor the same job title at the same facility, they suggest that the widerange of exposures are due to work practices rather than differences incontrols or tasks. According to the testimony of Mr. Morton, the dope operators are exposedto acetone for about four hours per shift. The primary responsibility ofdope operators is to wash the filter cloths in acetone. This exposure generallyresults in 8-hour TWA levels of 250 to 500 ppm [Tr. 8/4/88, p. 145]. Thepossibility of using ethyl acetate in place of acetone should be consideredfor this function, also. Monitoring results provided by the CMA show thatmost dope operators at the facility where the samples were taken are exposedat levels below 250 ppm. Eleven of the 17 samples were less than 250 ppmand 4 were between 250 and 500 ppm. Again, these samples were taken forthe same job at the same facility, suggesting that differences in workpractices provide a primary reason for the different levels of exposures.OSHA concludes that improvement to the existing engineering controls andcareful attention to work practices would be sufficient to protect thedope operators from overexposure to acetone. Spinning machine workers can be looked at in three groups: Doffers, acetateyarn spinning machine operators, and tow spinning machine operators. Five8-hour TWA exposure measurements for doffers were provided by the CMA.Four were in the range 250-500 ppm and one was over 500 ppm. Only one ofthe 20 samples for yarn spinning machine operators was under 250 ppm. Theremaining 19 were between 250 and 750 ppm. Exposure measurements for towspinning machine operators were split evenly below 250 ppm (26 of 50 samples)and in excess of 250 ppm. Both Tennessee Eastman and Hoechst-Celanese statedthat additional engineering controls are not feasible to further protectthese operators. ge Additional local ventilation would cause the fibersto become entangled and complete enclosure would prevent necessary accessto the equipment, as well as allowing the possibility of unsafe levelsof acetone to build up in the enclosed areas. ``. . .The proposed PEL of250 ppm [for acetone] is neither technologically nor economically feasible''according to the Chemical Manufacturers Association Ketones Programs Panel(the ``Panel'') [Ex. 98-15].  Based on the evidence submitted OSHA concludes that a PEL of 750 ppm foracetone is not only technically feasible, but is currently being met.The technological feasibility of the proposed 0.1 mg/m3 ceiling limit forexposures to nitroglycerin (NG) and ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN) isdisputed by the Institute of Makers of Explosives (IME) [Ex. 3-749 andEx. 190]. In this document, the Institute stated: ``Reducing workplacelevels of NG and EGDN to the proposed ceiling . . . through the applicationof administrative controls, engineering controls and/or personal protectiveequipment <T3>is not feasible'' </T3>(IME's emphasis).A number of arguments are presented to support this position. First, ``Administrativecontrols (limiting the duration of a worker's exposure) are applicablefor reducing . . . time-weighted averages, but not to the exposure levelsbased on short-term exposure limits or ceiling limits.'' Engineering controlsare considered infeasible primarily because of safety concerns, such asthe collection of explosive materials in local exhaust ventilation ductworkand the dangers of enclosing equipment. IME stated that general ductworkdilution ventilation has been effective in meeting the current 0.2 ppmceiling limits for NG and EGDN. An attempt has been made to estimate thecost and feasibility of engineering controls, but it was concluded that``. . . the system had a less than 50% probability of successfully attaininga level of 0.01 ppm (0.1 mg/m3).''On the feasibility of using personal protective equipment to comply withthe proposed standards, IME contended that ``Air purifying respiratorsare not generally suitable for use in NG/EGDN-containing atmospheres, andat least one manufacturer, Mine Safety Appliances, specifically warns againsttheir use in such atmospheres.'' [Ex. 3-749]. NIOSH does not approve theuse of canister or cartridge respirators for NG/EGDN because the odor thresholdis above the PEL. This means that a worker could be overexposed while wearinga respirator and not be aware of it.A self-contained breathing apparatus is not considered usable for long-termuse because of its weight. Thus, air-line respirators are the single remainingalternative means of achieving compliance. However, the IME contended:``Air-line respirators are not feasible because the air lines restrictemployee movement, thereby compromising several areas of operations safetyas well as the ease of evacuation in the event of emergencies. In addition,lines trailing behind workers would hinder compliance with the long-standingindustry standards for reducing to a minimum level all foreign items whichmight be accidentally introduced to the production equipment and product.''[Ex. 3-749] No studies could be found concerning safety aspects of airline respirators. The lack of studies, compliants, or incidents involvingsafety problems with air lines despite very common and widespread use,leads to a conclusion that there are no significant problems.The IME concluded that ``. . . airborne concentrations of NG/EGDN havealready been reduced to the practical minimum. Industry hygienists haveconcluded that reducing airborne concentrations would not decrease workerexposure and any further reductions must be accomplished through the implementationof improved personal hygiene and other workplace practices. The . . . industrycannot undergo further reductions without dramatically altering the manufacturingprocess. . . .''OSHA recognizes the unique difficulties which arise from attempts to controlexposures in the explosives industry, but <T3>does </T3>believe that the final limits can be met through a combinationof equipment improvements and respiratory protection. The Institute ofMakers of Explosives leaves open the possibility that exposures might befurther reduced by process and/or equipment improvements. If compliancecannot be achieved via engineering controls or process improvements, thenair-supplied respirators could be employed. Quick-release couplings onthe air lines would eliminate problems relating to ease of evacuation inemergencies.American Cyanamid Company suggested that the proposed standard of 0.03mg/m3 for acrylamide is not technologically feasible. To support this position,Cyanamid reports that ``NIOSH surveyed the acrylamide monomer manufacturingfacilities recently and found that exposure levels were above the 0.03mg/m3 level in all facilities'' [Ex. 3-961 and Tr. 8/11/88. p. 57]. Whileexposures above the proposed level may have been found at all of Cyanamid'sfacilities, all of the personal exposure readings at one of the four facilitiessurveyed were less than 0.012 mg/m3. All of the area samples at two ofthe four facilities were less than 0.15 mg/m3. The conclusions of the NIOSHHazard Study are that exposure levels were most dependent on the facilityor location where the employee works rather than his job duties and thatthe primary difference in exposure levels between facilities was due tothe background acrylamide air level (see <T3>Applied Industrial Hygiene, </T3>Vol. 1, No. 3, September 1986. ``Evaluationof Occupational Acrylamide Exposures,'' Bruce Hills and A.L. Griefe, ACGIH,Cincinnati, pp. 148-152). The plant at which the highest exposure levelswere measured, the only facility which manufactured dry acrylamide, hassince closed. The range of personal exposure measurements at the remainingthree facilities was 0.001-0.132 milligrams per cubic meter. Based on thedata and conclusions of the NIOSH field studies described in the HazardEvaluation, OSHA concludes that the PEL for acrylamide of 0.03 mg/m3 istechnologically feasible.U.S. Borax submitted information regarding expenditures they have madeon environmental controls to reduce exposures to borates. Since 1970, theyhave spent $7.5 million at the Boron, California, facility. Although someof these expenses have been related to the mining operation under the jurisdictionof the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), the remainder arerelated to operations which are of concern to OSHA. The range of dust levelsin the fusing department has been reduced to 0.63-50.54 mg/m3  and in theshipping department to 0.25-15.56 mg/m3 [Ex. 3-744]. It is not clear whetherfurther reductions could be achieved, and U.S. Borax does not address thisissue. Part of U.S. Borax' efforts to control dust related to paving someareas to reduce background dust levels. This effort has apparently beenat least partially successful, as evidenced by the minimum values in therange of exposures presented above. It appears that the 10 mg/m3 PEL levelfor borates should/might be achievable under most circumstances. Furtherreduction in borate dust levels might be achieved through the installationof additional engineering controls such as dust collection systems forbagging and packaging, additional dust collection systems at critical releasepoints and further reduction of background dust levels. If additional reductionsdo not achieve the required levels, the use of respirators will be necessaryto protect workers.SIC 29_Petroleum RefiningIn order to assure the quality of petroleum products and determine qualityof waste streams, petroleum refiners must sample their process streamsperiodically. As with maintenance, workers that sample process streamsare at risk of being in close contact with a variety of chemicals. Controlsfor this operation involve sampling boxes that vent gases and vapors awayfrom the operator and/or shield the operator from accidentally splashedor spilled material.Process stream samples are taken to the laboratory to determine if theirqualities lie within acceptable limits. As laboratory workers perform analyses,they can be exposed to various organic and inorganic chemicals if appropriateengineering controls are not in place or if proper procedures are not used.Exposure controls include exhaust fans and laboratory ventilation hoods.In general, this industry has extensive control technology in place forthe primary processing equipment. Closed processes with few exposed workersare predominant due to the requirements of process operation at elevatedtemperatures and pressures.SIC 30_Miscellaneous Plastic ProductsThe Styrene Information and Research Council (SIRC) identified open-moldingprocesses (i.e., processes in which styrene, frequently in combinationwith fibrous glass, is sprayed or rolled into a mold manually) as the typeof process most likely to have difficulty meeting the proposed PEL forstyrene [Ex. 3-742, p. 3 and Tr. 8/3/88, p. 5-94]. In SIC 3079, open-moldingprocesses were identified as being used in the production of undergroundstorage tanks, lavatory castings, tubs and spas, and cultured marble products[Ex. 3-742, p. 105 and Tr. 8/3/88, p. 5-181]. Other products that are madeusing open-molding processes include bridges for military vessels, [Tr.8/3/88, p. 5-188], planters [Ex. 3-742, Attachment 2, p. 15], benches [Tr.8/3/88, p. 5-195], and chimney stacks [Tr. 8/3/88, p. 5-188].Worker exposures to styrene occur principally in two process steps in theopen-molding process: gel-coating and lamination [Ex. 3-742, Attachment2, pp. 17-19 and Tr. 8/3/88, pp. 5-131 to 5-133]. Gel-coat is a pigmentedresin of polyester resin-based paint. The application of gel-goat is similarto the application of paint and is normally done using an air atomizeror airless spraygun. Lamination may be applied using either hand layupor hand sprayup. In hand layup, workers place a layer of fiberglass mattingdirectly onto the mold and secure the fiberglass with a layer of resin,which is normally applied with rollers or brushes. In the sprayup process,a chopper gun chops fiberglass roving into pieces and sprays resin at thesame time, so the two converge and are sprayed onto the mold simultaneously.The most extensive data source on exposures to styrene in this industrysector is a study conducted by the State of California's Division of OccupationalSafety and Health (DOSH) [Ex. 3-742, Attachment 2]. This study reportedthe results of an in-depth industrial hygiene survey of styrene and otherhazardous workplace exposures in the fiberglass/reinforced plastics industry.A total of 141 workplaces were inspected, and 379 of the 2600 workers employedin these workplaces were sampled over a full workshift [Ex. 3-742, Attachment2]. The report also recommends the best control measures to minimize hazardousexposures; the focus of the study was on large open-mold sprayup/layupoperations, because earlier research had shown that these open-moldingoperations had the highest exposures of all operations in these workplaces[Ex. 3-742, Attachment 2]. Styrene exposures (8-hour TWAs) at these processesranged from 0.2 to 288 ppm; the 8-hour TWA arithmetic mean and the medianfor these sample results were 43.0 ppm and 34.0 ppm, respectively [Ex.3-742, Attachment 2]. In a comparison of worker exposure levels by industry, the California OSHAstudy showed that the geometric mean exposure levels were highest in tub/showermanufacturing facilities (53.6 ppm), followed by camper manufacturing facilities(41.0 ppm), spa manufacturing facilities (25.8 ppm), miscellaneous manufacturingfacilities (22.0 ppm), and tank manufacturing facilities (12.7 ppm). Operationsranked according to percentage of styrene exposures above 100 ppm as an8-hour TWA (the former OSHA limit) were: tub/shower manufacturing (19 percent);spa manufacturing (11 percent); camper manufacturing (6 percent); miscellaneousplastics manufacturing (4 percent); and boat and tank manufacturing (none).The industrial hygienists who conducted this study initially believed thatworking on large molds, such as those involved in making boats (see discussionfor SIC 37) or tanks, would result in the highest styrene exposure levels,because the mold almost surrounds the worker, making a kind of confinedspace. Workers engaged in boat and tank manufacturing, however, had thelowest overall exposure levels, while workers in the tub/shower and spamanufacturing sectors had more workers exposed above 100 ppm. A partialexplanation for these differences in styrene exposure levels in variousindustry sectors is caused by differences in work production rates accordingto California OSHA. In boat manufacturing, for example, sprayup operationsare performed at a slow and intermittent rate while tub/shower manufacturingis conducted at an assembly-line pace [Ex. 3-742, Attachment 2]. Industryrepresentatives also believe that production volume plays a large rolein determining styrene exposure levels. Jack Winnick, general manager ofGold Shield Fiberglass in Fontana, California, testified that plants inWestern Europe can achieve much lower PELs than can plants in the UnitedStates because ``[t]he volume of resin throughput and products producedis a mere fraction of the throughput in U.S. facilities . . .'' [Tr. 8/3/88,p. 5-114]. California OSHA found, however, that the factor determining whether ornot 50 ppm TWA is currently being reached in facilities producing reinforcedplastics products is the degree to which effective controls have been implemented.The California OSHA researchers and Diane Factor of the AFL-CIO both reportedthat, in all cases where companies had implemented effective control measures,employee styrene exposure levels were below 50 ppm [Ex. 3-742, Attachment2, and Tr. 8/4/88, p. 6-64]. There is some question regarding the representativeness of the Californiastudies of conditions found elsewhere in the nation. First, SIRC notesthat winter climates in the northern-tier states may present additionalproblems in achieving the proposed PELs [Ex. 181A, p. 38]. Furthermore,the findings of the California study were qualified by its authors as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">This study was conducted in a CAL/OSHA compliance mode: This representstwo problems: (1) industrial hygienists do not have the luxury of makingfrequent visits to any one site, and (2) employees have an understandabledesire to minimize actual exposures by various means . . . in order toavoid CAL/OSHA citations and fines [Ex. 3-742, Attachment 2, p. 31]. </ITAG>OSHA appreciates the critiques of the CAL/OSHA study. OSHA found that employerswould need to employ a flexible compliance strategy during manual layup/sprayupoperations to achieve the proposed limits in boat-building facilities (seeTechnological Feasibility discussion for SIC 37). The California studyindicates that employee exposures to styrene during manual layup/sprayupoperations in facilities in SIC 30 are even higher than those for boat-buildingfacilities. Thus, there is uncertainty about the technical feasibilityof achieving the 50-ppm TWA and 100-ppm STEL limits exclusively by implementingengineering and work practice controls during manual layup/sprayup operationsin SIC 30. Respirators as well as engineering and work practice controlsmay be necessary to achieve these limits in some operations. OSHA concludes,however, that for most operations in SIC 30 where styrene is used, therevised TWA and STEL limits are technologicaly feasible. Daniel Boyd, representing the SIRC, also commented that the mixtures formuladescribed in 1910.1000(d)(2)(i) would necessitate reducing employee exposuresto well below 50 ppm. He stated that: <ITAG tagnum="21">Since the reinforced plastics environment consists of a number ofchemical constituents, the allowed exposure to these various chemicalsmust be calculated through the mixture formula. . . . OSHA's applicationof the mixture formula will require limits well below 50 ppm for styreneand [the proposed PEL of] 250 ppm for acetone [Tr. 8/3/88, p. 5-97]. </ITAG>The SIRC thus argued that, with the mixtures formula, ``OSHA has proposeda rule [for styrene] that would impose an exposure level lower than ithas accounted for in its feasibility analysis'' [Ex. 181A, p. 44]. OSHA does not agree with the SIRC that the mixtures formula requirementwill have a substantial impact on the ability of employers to comply withthe 50 ppm PEL for styrene. Traditionally, OSHA does not apply the mixturesformula in most cases where multiple exposures occur. According to OSHA's<T3>Field Operations Manual (FOM):</T3> <ITAG tagnum="21">The use of . . . [the mixtures formula] requires that the exposureshave an additive effect on the same body organ or system. Caution mustbe used in applying the additive formula, and prior consultation with theRegional Administrator is required (OSHA FOM, Chapter IV, Section 6(e)(i)).</ITAG>Thus, in the case of styrene and acetone, which are both used in the reinforcedplastics industry, OSHA does not believe that the mixture formula rulespecified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of the final rule would necessarily apply,because styrene is principally a narcotic agent that acts on the centralnervous system and acetone is primarily an irritant that acts on the eyesand respiratory passages at concentrations at or below the final PEL. Thesesubstances therefore cannot be considered as having an additive effect.Consequently, OSHA has based its feasibility assessment for styrene andacetone in the reinforced plastics industry on the availability of theengineering and work practice controls necessary to achieve the PELs forthese substances individually. Carbon disulfide is a solvent used in the production of cellulosic foodcasings. It is reacted with cellulose to make xanthate and is slowly releasedduring subsequent steps of production. The process currently used is theonly known process for producing cellulosic food casing, and carbon disulfideis the only known solvent for this process [Ex. 8-45].The feasibility of controlling exposures to carbon disulfide in the manufacturingof cellulosic food casings was questioned by representatives of the producersof these products, Viskase Corporation and Teepak, Incorporated [Exs. 33,162, 3-753, 8-19, 8-45, Tr. 8/2/88, pp. 4-201-217]. These commenters notedthat, in three specific operations, it is necessary to open the machineryto perform manual operations, (unloading the baratte, aligning strandsin the cabinet, and manual puncturing of the casings). When unloading thebaratte, manual raking is required because of the light and sticky characteristicsof xanthate, the parent compound. Operator access is required to keep thestrands of product properly aligned within the extrusion apparatus (or``cabinet''). Manual puncturing of the casings is required downstream ofthe extrusion nozzles [Ex. 8-45]. Personnel performing all three of theseoperations must open the process machinery while performing these tasks;currently, personnel wear air-supplied hoods to protect against the carbondisulfide excursions above 20 ppm associated with the operations [Tr. 8/2/88,p. 4-228]. Operator access is essential to assure casing quality [Ex. 162].An engineering study conducted in one of Viskase's plants concluded that``it is highly unlikely that the 1 ppm [level] could be obtained at [these]three * * * routine operator tasks,'' even if ``the most extreme measurethat can be visualized as an effort to reduce the concentration'' was employed[Ex. 8-45[. Teepak stated that ``no one * * * has developed a system orknows of any engineering controls that . . . [are] capable of reducingCS<T2>2</T2> levels in the casing industry to the 1 ppm level proposed byOSHA,'' adding that Teepak had recently redesigned and rebuilt much ofits plant using the best available technology [Ex. 162]. Commenters repeatedlystressed [Exs. 33, 162, Tr. 8/2/88, pp. 4-201 to 4-217] that feasibilitywas a problem only for these manual operations; thus, OSHA concludes thatthe use of respirators as well as engineering controls and work practices,may be necessary for unloading xanthate from the baratte, aligning strandsin the extrusion cabinet, and manual puncturing of casings at the extrusionnozzles unless OSHA can demonstrate that engineering controls and workpractices alone can achieve the PEL at the 8-hour TWA limit for carbondisulfide.  The Polyurethane Manufacturers Association (PMA) stated that the 0.02 ppmPEL for 4,4'-methylene bis (2-chloroaniline) (MBOCA) is technologicallyfeasible and is already being achieved in many facilities [Ex. 3-683].MBOCA is used as a fixative in producing castable polyurethane. The chemicalis no longer produced in this country, but is still widely used to producecastable polyurethane products. PMA [Ex. 3-683] also stated that no substitutefor MBOCA has been found that matches its physical properties and processingcharacteristics at a competitive price.  According to PMA, worker exposures to MBOCA occur chiefly during transferoperations. PMA stated that ``once the melted MBOCA is mixed with prepolymer,there is no risk of employee exposure to MBOCA'' [Ex. 3-683]. The industryhas developed a number of methods to control employee exposure to MBOCAduring transfer operations, including the use of isolated rooms, laboratoryhoods or glove boxes, and vacuum transfer systems that carry MBOCA fromdrums to the melters in closed, automated systems. PMA also stated that``based upon considerable workplace monitoring [conducted] since the 1970s,it is apparent that an employer who observes the recognized industry practicesfor the use of MBOCA and who monitors the results . . . will feasibly complywith the proposed TWA level [of 0.02 ppm]'' [Ex. 3-683]. Therefore, OSHAconcludes, based on the proven effectiveness of currently available technologythat a PEL of 0.02 ppm for MBOCA is technologically feasible.SIC 31._Leather and Leather Products During a site visit performed by OSHA to a shoe production facility [Ex.11_Firm 7], an overexposure to 2-butanone at the outer sole cementing operationwas found. A small exhaust system used at the operation had inadequateair movement to reduce exposure. The exposure exceeded the current PELof 200 ppm, as well as the proposed STEL of 300 ppm. The length of theexposure was 3.5 hours. The total cost for local exhaust ventilation tothe five affected work stations, as estimated by Clayton EnvironmentalConsultants, would be $20,000. This cost figure is based upon a flanged4 foot by 12 foot exhaust hood with a capture velocity of 100 feet perminute (fpm). The flow rate is estimated to be 775 cubic feet per minute(cfm) per work station. By employing these control measures, worker exposuresto 2-butanone, as well as to solvents in general, will be reduced.  The site visit firms did not have toluene overexposure. In general, tolueneexposures can be decreased by revising standard work practices to reducethe contact time between leather and toluene.SIC 32_Stone, Clay and Glass Products In batch mixing of raw materials for glass production (SICs 321 and 322),OSHA found that drysweeping and/or the use of compressed air for cleaningmay contribute substantially to the employees overall exposures. By substitutingvacuum cleaning systems, worker exposure can be reduced. The Brick Institute of America (BIA) stated that limited success has beenachieved by member companies in controlling clay and shale dust exposures.Despite the companies' efforts, employees are still required to wear respiratorsin some areas of the plants. Although local exhaust ventilation has beeninstalled at work station, the nature of the job requires workers to leavethe area of their work station. Furthermore, the moisture content of theraw materials ``creates substantial maintenance problems for the controlequipment.'' The BIA concludes ``. . . it simply is not possible to reducedust levels any further using known technology'' [Ex. 130]. OSHA conducted site visits to manufacturers of both cement blocks [Ex.11_Firms 2, 4] and a manufacturer of unglazed floor tiles [Ex. 11_Firm12]. These firms have processes analogous to brick manufacture. No overexposureswere found. In addition to good housekeeping measures, one of the principlemeans of controlling dust exposure was the use of wet materials. Dry materialhoppers were located outside the building or in locations above the workfloor. Mixers were generally fully automated. Workers who were requiredto work inside the mixer (after proper lockout procedures) using pneumatichammers to remove hardened materials, used local exhaust tubes, and worerespirators. OSHA concludes it is technologically feasible to control dustexposure in this industry.SIC 33_Primary Metals IndustriesThe American Iron and Steel Institute [Exs. 3-1123, 72, 129, 188] statedthat the proposed PELs were not technologically feasible if retrofittingwere required, and that most operations produce intermittent exposureswhere respiratory protection equipment is more appropriate. The AISI providedno support for their statement that retrofitting is not technologicallyfeasible, merely stating that some controls can only be installed whena plant is built or modernized. However, they provided several examplesof the cost of such retrofits, stating that the costs rendered the retrofitsinfeasible. This, however, does not support a finding that the technologydoes not exist to control the exposures. During site visits, OSHA observed a wide variety of controls in place inthis industry. How effective these controls are cannot be known for certain.When AISI agreed to assist OSHA in arranging site visits in this industry,they stipulated that the OSHA contractors could collect no air samplesduring the site visits. AISI submitted exposure data for different operations,but provided only the lowest and highest values for each chemical in eachoperation [Ex. 129]. When ranges are used, it is not possible to discernwhere most samples fall to assess potential feasibility. Where the highestvalue for a chemical is at or below the new PEL, the new PEL is clearlyfeasible. This is true in a number of cases, and demonstrates that controlsare available which will maintain exposures below the new PEL for thosechemicals. The exposure data does indicate that the STEL for sulfur dioxidecannot be regularly achieved with engineering and work practice controlsin blast furnace operations and at sulfur plants. In addition, there issome evidence that the ceiling limit for carbon monoxide cannot be regularlyachieved with engineering and work practice controls at blast furnace operations,vessel blowing, basic oxygen furnaces, and sinter plants. There is no evidenceto the contrary in the record for these two substances. OSHA, therefore,will permit flexibility in the use of respirators for these operations.The burden of proof will not be on the employer to demonstrate that compliancewith engineering and work practice controls are infeasible in a complianceaction for exposure to the STEL for sulfur dioxide and the ceiling forcarbon monoxide at these operations. AISI also provided a list of occupations and the related duties where exposuresare intermittent. Many of these would be considered cleaning and maintenance[Ex. 72]. Where exposures are brief and intermittent, or where they arerelated to cleaning and maintenance, respiratory protection may be theappropriate control technology in accord with OSHA's traditional policies.SIC 331_Basic Steel Products OSHA, through its contractors, has conducted site visits of various operationsassociated with steel manufacturing. During these visits, OSHA observedthat engineering controls were in use. Due to a pre-visit stipulation ofthe American Iron and Steel Institute, OSHA was not able to monitor exposuresat any of these operations. In a site visit to a sintering plant, OSHA observed the application ofa hood and local exhaust at the end of the sintering conveyor, a transferpoint for sintered material. Also, at the same plant, local exhaust pipingon the pug mills and the sinter air cooler was in place. The emissionsfrom these sources were directed to a centralized baghouse [Ex. 120_Firm28].At hot strip production facilities [Ex. 129_Firms 29, 31], workers controllingthe rolling process were positioned in air conditioned control stationsor pulpits. Workers engaged in the coiling and marking area were providedwith dilution ventilation.At Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) facilities [Ex. 129_Firms 37, 38] emissionsgenerated during desulfurization, deslagging and oxygen injection werevented to an electrostatic precipitator and/or baghouse. BOFs also emitcarbon monoxide as a byproduct. Some BOF processes use this as a meansof controlling the metallurgical reaction. This is controlled through theexhaust system. Continuous CO monitors are used to alert workers to peakor emergency conditions. During a visit to an electric arc furnace operation [Ex. 129_Firm 39],emission control equipment was an integral part of the furnace's rotatingroof. Contaminant generation during this operation was vented to an electrostaticprecipitator. The building in which this process was conducted had beenmodified to incorporate roof level hoods and ducts that carried escapingcontaminants to a centralized baghouse. At a coke oven gas processing facility [Ex. 129_Firm 32], operations werecarried out in enclosed vessels or process equipment (similar to thosefound in chemical processing facilities) that provide protection from continuousdirect exposure. OSHA believes that compliance with the proposed PELs canbe achieved since exposures are primarily the result of fugitive emissionsand operational upsets. At a blast furnace operation [Ex. 129_Firm 27] which was visited, the firmindicated its concern over the proposed PELs for carbon monoxide, sulfurdioxide, and calcium oxide. (Iron oxides were also generated in these operationsbut it was not clear that exposures to iron oxide were problematic. Thefinal rule retains the existing limit for iron oxide). Blast furnaces operateunder positive pressure and extremely rigorous conditions. These conditionsdo have a severe effect on the refractory lining of the furnace wall. Overtime contaminant release, particularly carbon monoxide, will occur. Thusblast furnaces of older design or furnaces reaching the end of their lifecycle will tend to have greater emissions of air contaminants. During thetapping of the furnace, workers are exposed to iron oxides, carbon monoxide,sulfur dioxide, and calcium oxide as hot metal pours into the transfercar via runners on the floor. In one site, these runners were covered toreduce emissions. Workers typically move between areas of high exposure in the manufacturingarea, and areas of low exposure in air-conditioned or heated control roomsor ``shanties.'' Exposures are intermittent. Processes at which they workalso have episodic periods of air contaminant emission. This dual variabilitysuggests that respiratory protection may be needed to control worker exposureto such metallurgical air contaminants as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide,iron oxide, and calcium oxide. SIC 332_Iron and Steel FoundriesOSHA conducted a site visit to a gray iron foundry [Ex. 11_Firm 13] engagedin the manufacturing of gray and ductile iron castings. Exposure sampleswere taken in the grinding process. The result of the sampling disclosedan exposure level of 39.0 mg/m\3\ TWA for iron oxide which is above boththe current and final PEL of 10 mg/m\3\ TWA. Clayton Environmental Consultants recommended a number of actions thatcan be taken to reduce iron oxide dust levels. A mechanical shakeout andautomatic sand handling system complete with dust collection can be implementedto substantially reduce dust levels. The mechanical shakeout would consistof a 16 square foot enclosure in which the molds and castings can be manipulatedand then brought back out for further processing. The existing muller hoodshould be maintained or upgraded to produce 900 CFM of local exhaust ventilation.It was also recommended that dust collection and make-up air systems wouldbe needed to replace exhausted air. For this purpose, make-up air shouldbe ducted for release near the work station and workers should be providedwith movable diffusers or a means of controlling airflow at the work station.The purchase of a rider-type sweeper was also recommended as a means tocontrol dust levels. Clayton also recommended controls to reduce grinding exposures. Local exhaustventilation can be installed on pedestal grinders. Grinders of this typeshould be exhausted at 1,000 CFM assuming 16 inch wheel diameters. Forhand-held grinders, a 2 foot by 3 foot ventilated table/bench is the recommendedcontrol. A 200 CFM/foot\2\ of grinding bench area exhaust rate is the estimatedrequirement for this application. Additional controls applicable to foundries were found during OSHA's reviewof this industry. These controls either individually or in combinationshould generally control exposures to the final PELs. andbullet; The arc air process in steel foundries (SICs 3324, 3325) was usedduring the processing of steel castings to control fumes. In order to ventilatethe arc air booths, fumes were exhausted through the back of the boothand fresh air was supplied from above and behind the operator. andbullet; Steel foundries (SICs 3324, 3325) used an overhead canopy hoodduring the induction melting of steel to control fumes. The hood consistedof sheet metal barriers extending down from the roof to the top of thehot metal ladle monorail. Thermal drafts carried the fumes upward intothe hood where they were exhausted by ventilators. Mancooler fans behindthe workers pushed some fumes under the hood. andbullet; Emissions during the oxy-acetylene torch cutoff of risers fromsteel castings was encountered in iron and steel foundries (SIC 332). Castingswere cut in a specially designed booth with a rear exhaust flow and a frontalair supply flow. Air pressure from the cutting nozzle of the torch wasdirected toward the rear exhaust port for effective dust and fume control.andbullet; Fume control of a sandwich-type innoculation in iron foundries(SICs 3321, 3322) was achieved through the use of a commercially availablecanopy hood. The fume-laden air was exhausted through mobile duct workand cleaned by a fabric collector before being discharged into the surroundingenvironment. The hood tilted with the furnace so that it always was directlyover the ladle for fume capture. andbullet; Fume, dust, and gas control from the melting of iron (SICs 3321,3322) in an arc furnace was achieved by the installation of a hood. Theexhausts collected by the hood were filtered by cloth filters before beingreleased into the external environment. andbullet; Control of dust and gas emissions from phenolic urethane coldbox core-making in iron foundries (SIC 3321, 3322) included local exhaustventilation which provided negative pressure at the core box. Parting linegaskets, blow seals, and stripper pin o-rings were regularly maintainedfor emission control. Exhaust outlets captured excessive dust. andbullet; In an iron foundry (SICs 3321, 3322), hot combustion gases wereexhausted and flowed through an after burner, cooled, and then passed througha dust collector. Tapping emissions were captured by a canopy hood. Generalventilation was provided by mancooler fans. The UAW [Ex. 197] listed additional feasible control measures in foundryand other metallurgical operations. These include: (a) adequate make-up air; (b) supplied air islands for operator stations (laminar flow, down draftmake up air supply units); (c) tempered (cooled) make up air to reduce the need for high velocityair for heat stress relief; (d) process arrangement to remove loose sand from castings after shakeoutbefore they are finished; (e) maintenance of enclosures and exhaust volume for sand handling equipmentto prevent emission of dust; (f) reduction of silica burn-in on castings to reduce exposures at cleaningand finishing operations; (g) use of wet methods. SIC 333/334_Primary and Secondary Non-Ferrous MetalsIn its review of technological feasibility in the non-ferrous metals industry,OSHA identified the following examples of engineering control and workpractice measures:andbullet; Control of emissions from aluminum ore handling and storage (SIC3334) was addressed with an unloader which uses movable vacuum nozzlesto remove alumina and coke from barges. The ore was moved on an enclosedconveyor which was equipped with air exhaust hoods at loading and transferpoints. The operator can be situated in an air conditioned cab.andbullet; Reduction of alumina dust emissions during ship unloading (SIC3334) was achieved by automating and controlling operations from an enclosedcontrol booth. Furthermore, mixing operations were hooded and exhausted.andbullet; During anode rodding in prebake plants during primary aluminumproduction (SIC 3334), spent butt remover, butt crushers, cast iron remover,and shot cleaner were exhausted to a bag filter dust collector. Use ofinduction furnaces and exhaust hooding reduced metal fume exposure duringmelting. Hoods and slotted hoods were also used. The operator can maintaincontrols from an enclosed console.andbullet; Control of air emissions during potline operations of aluminumsmelters (SIC 3334) was achieved through the use of potroom ventilationand automated processes such as the use of hooding which consists of curvedand ribbed shields, the employment of a dual draft system, and an exhaustsystem which leads to a dry scrubber. Other control methods included hoodingwith rigid air-operated doors which exhausted the emissions through airtakeoffs to an expanding duct exhaust manifold which, in turn, was exhaustedby a fan. Furthermore, computer-controlled systems existed which couldautomatically perform production functions without requiring workers toopen pots or hood shields above pots.andbullet; The mercury cell process may be used in aluminum smeltering (SIC3334) to produce chlorine gas from brine water. To reduce chlorine gasexposure as a result of this production, the diameter of the brine headerwas increased to accommodate the gas phase above the liquid phase; thenumber of cells in the system was increased; the pH of the brine was adjusted;the compressor controls were modified to accommodate surges in pressure;inlet box covers were replaced with better covers; and the brine feed nozzleflange was modified.andbullet; Several engineering controls have been recommended for coppersmelting locations (SICs 3331, 3341). A preventive maintenance programcan be developed and implemented to insure that ventilation and conveyorsystems are operating properly. Dead beds can be installed in chutes tobreak the fall of material and reduce the level of dust generated. Pneumaticaerators can be installed to eliminate the need for manual air lancingin bins and chutes. Industrial vacuum systems can be used.andbullet; Collection hoods can be installed at each conveyor transfer pointat copper smelter sites (SICs 3331, 3341) to control copper particulate.Primary copper smelting conveyor skirting can be properly adjusted, andfingers installed at discharge points. Inspection doors should not be leftopen, and the lunchroom/breakroom should be located outside of the reclaimbuilding. General measures throughout copper smelting plants (SICs 3331,3341) to control copper dust emissions included: using local exhaust ventilationfor localized sources, and general exhaust ventilation for areas with unidentifiablesources; enclosing conveyor belts and transfer points; enclosing the airconveying system for the transfer of flue dusts; enclosing workers' operatingvehicles; installing secondary hoods on converters; prohibiting the blowingout of converters while on stack; performing preventive maintenance onballoon flues; not allowing converters to remain rolled out for extendedperiods of time; and providing cleaning rooms with filtered, tempered,positive pressure air. When hauling slag from the metal smelting operation,slag can be granulated after skimming with high velocity water; a chemicaldust suppression system can be used when crushing any cooled slag; andthe slag crew can ride downwind from fumes. Further engineering controlsinclude constructing pulpits for operators; close-coupling the ventilationsystem to the Larry car; using dead beds in calcine loading; enclosinga portion of the building to block wind; and vacuuming the superstructureof the Larry car and any spills.andbullet; Controls used to decrease exposures to arsenic, dust and sulfurdioxide at primary copper and lead smelters (SICs 3331, 3332) includedupgrading the present ventilation systems; operating electric furnacesat negative pressure; eliminating air lancing as a method of removing concentratesfrom receiving hoppers; using pneumatic aerators or belt wipes; using wettechniques in storage; reclaiming concentrates; and improving general housekeeping.andbullet; Exposures to lead, cadmium, and arsenic at lead and copper smelters(SICs 3331, 3332) were reduced by the replacement of old sintering machineswith ones equipped with dust and fume controls and by placing a cover overthe charge hole when slag was not being charged into the reverberatoryfurnace.andbullet; Use of a multipurpose crane with an enclosed cab reduced operatorexposures to air emissions at carbon bake plants (SIC 3334). The cab wassupplied with filtered conditioned air. The crane was equipped with a vacuumsystem which could aspirate cake from ovens and separate fines.andbullet; Controls for exposure to soluble platinum salts in precious metalrefining (SIC 3339) included local exhaust ventilation used in jaw crusherand recovery sampling, maintenance of a closed system in refinery throughuse of glove box filters, the use of borohydrate solution to wash downspills and reduce salts tIndustrial vacuum systems can be used.andbullet; Collection hoods can be installed at each conveyor transfer pointat copper smelter sites (SICs 3331, 3341) to control copper particulate.Primary copper smelting conveyor skirting can be properly adjusted, andfingers installed at discharge points. Inspection doors should not be leftopen, and the lunchroom/breakroom should be located outside of the reclaimbuilding.

Asarco, Inc., questioned the technological feasibility of achieving theproposed PELs for sulfur dioxide. In its written statement to the docket[Tr. 8/15/88, pp. 120-124], Asarco provided several examples of the natureof engineering controls that have been installed at its plants. ``Asarco'scopper smelter in Hayden, Arizona, has been modernized with the installationof an Inco flash smelting furnace, as well as the installation of controldevices, such as secondary converter hoods. Additional controls, includingsecondary converter hoods with an air current design have also been installedin Asarco's copper smelter at El Paso, Texas.'' Asarco maintains ``despitethese controls, however, SO<T2>2</T2> concentrations for a number of job classifications at Asarco'scopper smelters exceed or may exceed the proposed TWA of 2 ppm. Morever,it appears that most smelter jobs in molten areas would frequently exceedthe proposed STEL of 5 ppm, because of the episodic nature of smeltingoperations. Asarco is not aware of any combination of engineering and workpractice controls that can feasibly reduce exposures to the levels requiredby the standard.'' Magma Copper Company, in written testimony [Tr. 8/12/88] has also expressedconcern on [Ex. 3-91, pp. 92-105] the achievement of the proposed standardsfor SO<T2>2</T2>. Magma is in the process of installing new emission controlsat its smelter at a cost of $132,000,000. The elements of this retrofitinclude ``a new state of the art Outokumpu flash furnace obviating threeexisting reverberatory furnaces. The retrofit has also an improved convertergas handling system as well as a new secondary gas collection system. Thesmelter has local ventilation to all areas that have historically beensources of SO<T2>2</T2> emissions, and as such, the smelter should have limited problemswith fugitive emissions. . . .'' ``Additionally, the converters have twoseparate local ventilation systems. The primary system collects the highestconcentration of SO<T2>2</T2> and supplies an acid plant. The secondary local ventilationsystem collects gases during some phases of the converter roll out operation.''Magma has stated that the flash furnace ``was placed on line in July ofthis year'' and ``start-up is estimated to be completed with normal operationsin place by November 1, 1988. Therefore, a comprehensive survey of ournew engineering control system is not feasible at present.'' However, Magmahas estimated from past data and ``for various configurations'' that the5 ppm STEL ``is not likely to be met.'' Asarco has also submitted as an attachment to its written statement a portionof its 1977 post-hearing brief that discusses the problems of SO<T2>2</T2> control. In it, Asarco refers to the report ``EnvironmentalConditions in U.S. Copper Smelters'' by Willian L. Wagner of NIOSH as evidenceof the need to use respirators. Quoting from the report, Asarco cites,``In most smelters the use of respirators is essential on charge floorsof reverberating furnaces, in the green feed galleries, tripper decks abovethese furnaces or any areas above these furnaces. In these areas, the SO<T2>2</T2> concentrations varied from non-detectable levels to many hundredsof parts per million. . . .'' In addition, Asarco also relies on the testimonyof Mr. Wagner at the 1977 hearings in which he addressed the then-proposed``ceiling limit'' of 10 ppm, ``for most parts of the smelter.'' ``Thereare a number of areas where you could get concentrations of sulfur dioxidefor periods of time greater than 10 parts per million.'' According to Mr.Wagner, concentrations exceeding 10 ppm could easily last 15 to 20 min.As this discussion indicates, there are many engineering and work practicecontrols available to reduce exposure to SO<T2>2</T2> and the other contaminants present. They will frequently beable to control exposure to 2 ppm. However, for some operations, feasibleengineering controls may not be available. OSHA will accept the use ofrespirators in conjunction with engineering controls unless OSHA can demonstratethat engineering controls and work practices alone can achieve the 2 ppmPEL. Brief peak exposures will occur over 5 ppm in several areas of a lead orcopper smelter. Good work practices will curtail many of these. However,respirators may be appropriate in smelters along with other controls tocontrol peak exposures unless OSHA can demonstrate that engineering controlsand work practices alone can achieve a 5 ppm STEL. SIS 336_Non-Ferrous Foundries Fumes were controlled during the casting of bronze in foundries (SIC 3362)through the use of enclosing hoods. A mobile hood exhausted the ladle atall hot metal transfer points. Flexible ducting connected the hood to atraveling exhaust carriage. SIC 339_Miscellaneous Primary Metals Products Manufacturers improved dust control using closed screw conveyors in thetransport and manufacture of iron powder (SIC 3399). Open conveyor beltswere changed to a closed screw conveyor system. Duct work was totally replaced.Local exhaust was provided for the rotary screens. New baghouses and electrostaticprecipitators were also installed. OSHA visited a manufacturer of metalalloy powders [Ex. 145, Attachment A]. Although overexposures to the currentPELs were not found, a reduction to the new PELs would result in overexposures.To reduce cobalt dust exposures below the 0.05 mg/m\3\ level, additionalmonitoring should be conducted to verify the need for engineering controls.The following measures were recommended and determined to be necessary:(1) Use of an exhausted booth for developmental screening, (2) routingair discharged from the dust collector associated with the vortex classiferto the outdoors or into the plant's main dust collection system, (3) providingexhaust ducts to be connected to atomizer drums during cleanout periods,and (4) discontinue the practice of dry-sweeping the floors and eitheracquire a vacuum sweeper truck or use the central vacuum system more extensively.SIC 34_Fabricated Metal ProductsControl of copper dust at a cookware manufacturing plant (SIC 3469) wasaddressed by unclogging the ventilation system, repositioning cooling fans,and instituting weekly ventilation system inspection and maintenance programs.A plating shop (SIC 3471) uses extensive local exhaust ventilation to controlworker exposure. Each part to be plated undergoes some surface pretreatment.This can consist of shot-peening, abrasive blasting, degreasing, wax ortape masking and other treatments. Parts are manually placed into the tankusing an overhead hoist for large parts.The tanks are set on top of concrete ducts. The floors of the shop andthe aisles between the tanks are reinforced concrete, however the areaaround the perimeter of the tank is open to the basement and covered bysteel grating. The ducts are connected to a fan on the roof of the building.The largest of the hard chrome tanks, holding over 1000 gallons of platingsolution, has a two sided lateral exhaust ventilation system. The sloton each side consists of a series of seven slots. The slots are set backfrom the edge of the tank but an overhanging hood extends to the edge ofthe tank. A second tank has both a two sided slot ventilation system anda cover. This two piece cover is hinged to a ventilation manifold and extendsbeyond the front and rear edges of the tank.Arc welding is performed in many SICs as an auxiliary process and in severalindustries such as fabricated structural metals (SIC 3441), as the principalprocess requiring engineering control. During the welding process, temperaturesare sufficiently high to vaporize some of the base material of the electrodeand produce large quantities of fumes containing the elements in the electrodeand the base metal. Thus welders and other workers in the vicinity areexposed to mixtures of fume-sized particulates and both irritant and toxicgases which in combination may have additive or synergistic physiologicaleffects.Differences in worker exposure are attributable to a variety of factorsincluding type of welding helmet worn, position of the welding operator,the work environment, arc time, and the availability and performance ofventilation equipment. Arc time varies greatly due to differences in workschedules, set up times, and the sizes, shapes and types of tasks. Taskscan vary from short-term repairs conducted irregularly to full time productionwelding.During arc time the fume is generated within or close to the worker's breathingzone. Background fume concentrations could also be significant if a largenumber of welders are working or the work is being performed in a relativelyconfined space.Because of the numerous factors that can influence exposure levels duringwelding, three different types of controls can be used for various weldingsituations. The controls include: (1) Local exhaust ventilation for weldingin shops; (2) ambient air cleaning devices to minimize background fumeconcentrations; and (3) a portable blower for use in confined areas.Local exhaust ventilation configurations include: a welding bench witha backdraft hood for small to medium work pieces; a fixed close-capturehood placed at the back of a work rest table; a portable close-capturesystem including electrostatic precipitator; or an exhaust hose incorporatedinto the structure of the welding gun.Ambient air cleaning devices are designed to lower background welding fumeswhich escape collection by the local exhaust system. The ambient air cleaneris expected to surpass general dilution ventilation systems in terms ofboth fume removal and cost.A portable blower system works by exhausting fumes from a confined spacethrough a large flexible tube.No commenter questioned technological feasibility for this industry.SIC 35_MachineryIn addition to techniques for weld fume control mentioned above, in themanufacture of pumps, employee exposure to welding fumes was controlled(SIC 3561) through the use of an air lux fume eliminator.In the milling of tungsten carbide tools (SIC 354), the placement of localexhaust ventilation controlled cobalt exposures during the transfer ofcarbide.Oil mist is used in the SIC during the manufacturing of parts on screwmachines or other machine parts. There is a wide assortment of engineeringand work practice controls to reduce exposure to oil mist [Tr. 8/5/88,p. 7-53]. Since OSHA is retaining the existing PEL of oil mist, OSHA concludesthat the PEL is technologically feasible.In farm equipment manufacturing and repair (SIC 3523), paint mist was controlledthrough sophisticated application techniques as applied to downdraft spraybooths. The use of heated paint in the painting of hay stack wagons allowedthe airless atomization to take place at relatively low paint pressures.This resulted in low droplet velocity with little rebound.In the manufacture of machinery, degreasing operations using refined petroleumsolvents are prevalent. The AFL-CIO [Ex. 194] and UAW [Ex. 197] noted additionalfeasible measures for control of exposure to refined petroleum solvents(RPS) such as VMP naptha:(1) Spray application of liquids containing RPS should be permitted onlyin exhaust ventilated enclosures such as spray booths.(2) Articles coated with liquids containing RPS should be kept in containersequipped with local exhaust ventilation to prevent evaporation of RPS intowork room air.(3) Equipment for bulk transfer of RPS should be equipped with vapor capturesystems.(4) Exhaust ventilation should not recirculate RPS vapors into workroomair.(5) Cleaning of floors with RPS should not be permitted.(6) Where spray booths are cleaned with RPS, ventilation should be maintainedduring cleaning.(7) Quantities of RPS used and surface area coated with RPS containingliquids should be kept to a minimum.(8) Splashing of RPS containing liquids or creating of puddles on flooror other surfaces should not be permitted.(9) Open surface tanks containing RPS should be equipped with covers andlocal exhaust ventilation. Covers should be closed when not in use. Specialattention should be paid to preventing forced expulsion of vapors duringaddition of materials and entrainment of vapors when articles are addedto or removed from open surface tanks.(10) Open buckets of RPS should not be permitted. Containers for RPS shouldbe equipped with self closing covers. Rags or other material soaking inRPS should be kept in closed containers.(11) Procedures for response to spills and leaks, including criteria forevacuation of personnel not essential to safe cleanup, should be devised.(12) Skin contact should be prevented by redesign of operations to eliminatedipping of hand into RPS containing liquids, minimizing splashing or mistcontact and wetting of skin and clothing. Gloves and impervious clothingshould be supplied where wetting of skin and clothing can't be prevented.No commenters challenged the technological feasibility of meeting the proposedPELs in this industry.SIC 36_Electric and Electronic EquipmentElectric lamp manufacturers (SIC 3641) have reduced mercury vapor in lightingplants. Glass pellets used as starters for fluorescent lamps were flamesealed after mercury had been injected into them. Overhead suction velocityof the exhaust system was increased to reduce mercury overexposure. Also,as a special vacuum cleaner was employed to clean the turntable.The use of styrene for open mold fiberglass operations in the manufactureof household refrigeration equipment (SIC 3632) is similar to the use inSIC 37_Transportation Equipment. Thus, respirators may be required to augmentengineering controls during manual layup/sprayup operations, as discussedin SIC 37, below.Technological feasibility was not addressed by commenters to the docketin this sector.SIC 37_Transportation EquipmentThe Styrene Information Research Council (SIRC) identified manual layupand sprayup processes as operations in this sector that would not be ableto meet either the 50-ppm PEL or the 100-ppm ceiling that the Agency hasproposed as limits for styrene [Exs. 187, 3-742; Tr. 3/8/80, p. 5-94].The open-molding process is primarily used in this sector to make fiberglassboats and fiberglass car and truck bodies (especially bodies for recreationalvehicles). The feasibility issue that is raised relates to production operationsthat involve the spraying of large volumes of resin containing styreneon large surfaces where volatilization occurs [Ex. 198, Tr. 8/3/88, p.5-95]. The single most extensive data source on exposures to styrene is a studyconducted by the State of California's Division of Occupational Safetyand Health (DOSH) [Ex. 3-742, Attachment 2]. This study reported the resultsof an in-depth industrial hygiene survey of styrene and other hazardousexposures in the fiberglass/reinforced plastics industry. A total of 141workplaces were inspected, and 379 of the 2,600 workers employed in theseworkplaces were sampled over a full workshift [Ex. 3-742, Attachment 2].The report also recommended the best control measures to minimize hazardousexposures; the focus of the study was on large open-mold sprayup/layupoperations because earlier research had shown that these open-molding operationshad the highest exposures of all operations in these workplaces [Ex. 3-742,Attachment 2]. Styrene exposures (8-hour TWAs) at these processes rangedfrom 0.2 to 288 ppm. The overall arithmetic and geometric means for thesesample results were 43.0 ppm and 34.0 ppm, respectively [Ex. 3-742, Attachment2], but exposures in some industries and for some processes were substantiallyhigher. The range of exposures in boat-building facilities was found to be 3.4to 90.8 ppm (92 workers sampled); for workers in the recreational vehicle(camper) segment, this range was 7.3 to 130.3 ppm (48 workers sampled).Because few firms in the recreational vehicle and boat-building segmentsof this industry had adequate and effective ventilation controls, the Californiastudy concluded ``that feasible engineering controls exist to reduce exposuresto levels recommended by ACGIH and NIOSH of [a] 50-ppm TWA and [a] 100-ppmexcursion limit for styrene'' [Ex. 3-742, Attachment 2, p. 36].During the course of this rulemaking, OSHA conducted site visits to twoboat-making facilities that use the open-mold process to build fiberglassboats [Exs. M-20, M-21]. These two sites were characterized by the industryas a facility that used traditional ventilation to control chemical exposures,and a facility that represented the ``best available technology.'' In bothfacilities, both the full-shift and the excursion exposures of the gel-coatoperators were below the proposed levels. However, the layup and sprayupprocesses in the traditional facility were conducted in an open area thatwas ventilated only with general dilution ventilation. In this plant, laminationemployees' styrene exposures ranged from 61.9 to 341.5 ppm as 8-hour TWAsand from 98.7 to 311.0 ppm as 15-minute STELs [Ex. M-21]. In the ``bestavailable technology'' facility, three-sided booths were used for the laminationoperations. Here the lamination employees' exposures ranged from 36.7 to93.8 ppm as 8-hour TWAs, with only one in three exposures below 60 ppm,and from 64.0 to 199.0 ppm as 15-minute STELs [Ex. M-20]. The additionalcontrol measures that are available, such as increasing the face velocityof exhaust equipment, may not enable this facility to reduce the exposuresof its lamination workers from their current levels (ranging between 36.7to 93.8 ppm) to levels within the proposed limits without interfering substantiallywith the correct consistency of the resin. The extensive exposure and control data reported in the California studyindicate that current styrene exposures are within, or can be controlledto, the Agency's proposed limits in some industries and occupations. Thesedata, together with OSHA's on-site observations, are considerably lesscertain when it comes to the feasibility of the proposed limits for thelarge-volume open-mold processes necessary to produce boats and campers(as well as other large molded products in other industries). The California data (Ex. 3-742, Attach. 2] and the OSHA data [Exs. M-20,M-21] showed somewhat different patterns of exposure. Whereas all industryand occupational subgroups of the California data had at least a substantialminority of exposures below 50 ppm, only one exposure observation for laminationin either facility visited by OSHA was below 60 ppm. The maximum 8-hourTWA for boat building observed in the California study was 90.8 ppm, andthe large-mold boat manufacturers were described as having low averageexposures [Ex. 3-742, Attachment 2]. At the facilities visited by OSHA,on the other hand, the maximum exposure was 341.5 ppm. The large-scale open-mold processes were described in the California studyas ``intermittent,'' and the authors attributed the lower-than-expectedstyrene exposures to this characteristic [Ex. 3-742, Attachment 2]. SIRCnotes that additional feasibility problems may arise in extreme environments,and that northern-tier states, where many boat builders are located, havewinter climates that are quite different from that of California [Ex. 181A,p. 38]. A report submitted to the docket by the Wisconsin Department ofIndustry (Ex. HSP) concludes that many of the existing boat-building plantsin Wisconsin will be physically unable to accommodate the complex controlsneeded to reduce employee exposures to styrene to below the 50-ppm TWAand the 100-ppm STEL (Ex. HSP). Since the plants visited by OSHA were inthe Midwest, regional differences may help to explain the discrepant findings.The authors of the Cal/OSHA study qualified their findings as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">This study was conducted in a CAL/OSHA compliance mode: This representstwo problems: (1) industrial hygienists do not have the luxury of makingfrequent visits to any one site, and (2) employees have an understandabledesire to minimize actual exposures by various means . . . in order toavoid CAL/OSHA citations and fines [Ex. 3-742, Attachment 2, p. 31].</ITAG>The California study notes that these factors may well have contributedto the relatively low mean exposures found in the study. However, OSHAnotes that industrial hygienists were present in the plants long enoughto demonstrate that high exposures can be controlled. OSHA concludes that, in many operations within SIC 37, the proposed limitsfor styrene are feasible with the use of engineering and work practicecontrols. However, the record evidence demonstrates considerable uncertaintyabout the technical feasibility of achieving the 50 ppm TWA and 100 ppmSTEL exclusively by means of engineering controls and work practices duringmanual sprayup/layup operations in this sector. Accordingly, OSHA concludesthat the use of respirators as well as engineering and work practice controlsmay be necessary to achieve these limits in these manual operations, unlessOSHA can demonstrate that engineering and work practice controls alonecan achieve the PEL. OSHA also received some comments regarding the feasibility of achievingthe proposed 0.2 ppm PEL for MEKP in boat manufacturing facilities. RobertSchumacker, a certified industrial hygienist representing a group of sixmanufacturing companies (including the U.S. Marine Corporation), statedthat information is lacking as to what concentrations of MEKP currentlyexist in the workplace, how to measure MEKP in the occupational environment,and the feasibility of engineering controls for reducing exposure to MEKP[Ex. 3-1172, Attachment; Exs. 8-86, 151]. The National Marine ManufacturersAssociation [Ex. 181] expressed similar opinions. OSHA believes that the record contains substantial information demonstratingthat the final rule's PEL of 0.7 ppm for MEKP is technologically feasiblein boat manufacturing facilities. The record contains several NIOSH healthhazard evaluations and technical assistance surveys conducted in workplaceswhere MEKP was used as a reaction catalyst in operations similar to thosein boat building, including manual layup and sprayup operations (NIOSH:HE-79-132-673; TA-76-66; and HE-78-3-555). At three sites surveyed, allpersonal and area samples were below the proposed 0.7 ppm level. The NMMA[Ex. 181] reviewed these and other NIOSH reports (NIOSH: HE-79-092-629;HE-79-012-809) and noted that NIOSH recommended a number of engineeringmethods to reduce employee exposures to MEKP. These methods, which weresupported by NMMA, included:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Preventive maintenance on a scheduled basis for cleaning and changingfilters on spray booths; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Improvements in general dilution ventilation; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Release of residual pressure from an MEKP container through the spraygun under local ventilation rather than through the pop-off valve. </ITAG>OSHA also conducted two site visits to boat-building facilities in whichMEKP was used [Exs. 136B]. One plant was a high-volume facility that produced24 boats per day, while the other plant produced two to three boats perday. At both of these facilities, MEKP samples taken on gel coat and laminationworkers were below the final rule's 0.7 ppm limit. In regard to sampling and analytical methods for MEKP, OSHA notes thatNIOSH has published a method (PECA or 3508) for this substance, and OSHAhas developed an in-house method that is available from the Agency on request;the OSHA method was used successfully on the two site visits to MEKP-usingfacilities conducted for this rulemaking. Therefore, based on the informationcontained in the record and summarized above, OSHA finds that the 0.7 ppmPEL for MEKP is technologically feasible in transportation facilities.SIC 38_InstrumentsMany fluxing agents are used in soldering and brazing operations duringinstrument manufacture. In most cases, these fluxes give off acid or alkalifumes when heated that can irritate the skin. Conducting soldering andbrazing operations in well-ventilated areas and use of protective clothingand gloves is recommended.For many soldering and brazing operations, general dilution ventilationwill control fumes and vapors; that is, enough fresh air is added to thecontaminated air that hazardous concentrations do not develop.Local exhaust ventilation is the most effective means of control for airbornecontaminants produced by the soldering or brazing process. Local exhaustventilation can be provided by several types of equipment: freely movablehoods, fixed enclosures (booths), and down-draft benches.A freely movable hood consists of a movable hood attached to a fan. Thefan draws air from the work space and exhausts it outdoors, either directlyor through a dust collection system. The hoods are normally constructedso that they can be moved into place by the solderer. The air handlingsystem should move air at least 100 feet per minute across the solderingsite at even the most remote point from the exhaust opening. It is importantthat the exhaust hood be placed as near as possible to the work being done.As such, the proper functioning of a freely movable hood is dependent upongood work practices of the solderer. In some instances soldering or brazing operations carried out in a fixedlocation can be provided with a fixed enclosure. This is a structure builtaround the soldering or brazing operation which has a top and at leasttwo sides. A means for drawing air through the work area is provided sothat the work space is flushed continuously with fresh air.Within such an enclosure, work should be arranged and conducted in sucha way that the fresh air enters the enclosure through the worker's breathingzone and then through the work space in which the contaminants are produced.For most fixed enclosure, the air should move at least 100 feet per minuteacross the entrance to the enclosure.A third type of level exhaust ventilation system is the down-draft benchor table. The soldering or brazing is performed on a bench or table whichhas an open grid as the work surface. Air is drawn downward through thegrid, into the duct work, and then exhausted.The Health Industry Manufacturers Association (HIMA) expressed supportfor ``the phased-in period of compliance, which would allow the use ofengineering controls, work practices, and respirators for a period of fouryears while employers evaluate and reduce/eliminate potential exposuresto these substances in the workplace'' [Ex. 3-910]. They raised no technologicalfeasibility issue.  SIC 39_Miscellaneous ManufacturingIn the manufacture of hard surface floor coverings (SIC 3996), processesinclude pre-weighing and blending raw materials, followed by mixing andgelling of the composition in internal batch mixers of the Banbury typeor by continuous mixing operations carried out in mixers of the extrudertype.Potential worker exposures may result from dusts of the raw materials asthey are handled (automatically or manually) prior to and during chargingof the mixer. Fumes and dusts can emanate from leaks on the mixer and fromhot, freshly mixed material as it is discharged. The types of exposures depend on the substances used. Applicable exposurecontrols include local exhaust ventilation at the mixer doors and overconveyor transfer points. The use of good working practices is extremelyeffective in controlling exposures during the opening of the mixers andthe pouring of materials.OSHA received one comment related to the issue of technological feasibilityin the Sporting and Athletic Goods sector (SIC 3949). Robert Sigler, presidentof S.R. Smith, Inc., a manufacturer of diving boards, stands, and otherreinforced plastics accessories for swimming pools, commented that hisplant ``will face severe economic hardship and possible closure'' if theproposed 50 ppm limit for styrene is retained. Mr. Sigler believes thiswould be the case because ``the entire layout of our manufacturing areaand the entire ventilation system would have to be completely strippedand replaced'' [Ex. 3-380].OSHA has evaluated the technological feasibility of achieving compliancewith a 50 ppm limit for styrene in reinforced plastics operations in severalsectors (recreational boat manufacture, cultured marble tubs and showers,and underground storage tanks). Manufacture of fiberglass burial vaults(SIC 3995) is similar to these also. There is a considerable similarityamong these various reinforced plastics operations: all involve the useof a styrene resin that is reinforced with fiberglass and applied by ``choppergun'' and all involve manual layup and rolling. Thus, although the sizeand shape of the piece being built may vary, the exposure problems encounteredby operators in these facilities are similar in nature. OSHA has determinedthat employers whose employees perform manual layup and rollup in reinforcedplastics operations may need to use a combination of engineering controls,work practices and personal protective equipment to achieve the proposedstyrene limit. OSHA's reasoning on this issue can be found in the previousdiscussion, under SIC 37, Transportation Equipment, and SIC 30, Rubberand Plastic Products.The Casket Manufacturers Association of America (CMAA) submitted informationto the record on the technological feasibility of achieving compliancewith the Agency's proposed hardwood dust standard of 1 mg/m3 [Ex. 8-78].The CMAA reported that finishing operations, particularly machine and handsanding of ``white'' wood caskets, often are associated with dust ``levels3-5 times higher than those in the furniture industry. . .'' [Ex. 8-78].In support of this position, the CMAA submitted two sets of exposure results:9 results from samples taken specifically for this rulemaking, and 24 sampleresults described as ``historical'' and drawn from a variety of sources[Ex. 8-78].Results from the CMAA's recent analysis ranged from 0.8 to 72 mg/m3; howeversampling times ranged from 90 minutes to 390 minutes. Seven of these ninerecent samples showed results below 5 mg/m3. Results from the historicalset of samples ranged from 0.42 to 29 mg/m3; sampling periods were evenshorter than those for the recent set, ranging from 55 to 133 minutes [Ex.8-78].The data provided by the CMAA are not adequate to draw firm conclusionsabout the feasibility of achieving compliance with a 5 mg/m3 standard forhardwood dust in the hardwood casket manufacturing segment. For example,these data cannot be used to evaluate employees' full-shift exposures becausethey do not represent 8-hour sampling periods. In addition, no job descriptionsor task analyses are presented, and thus no deductions can be drawn aboutexposures for the unsampled portion of the day. In addition, no detailsare provided about the specific type of wood involved in casket making,beyond stating that it is a hardwood.However, OSHA believes that the final rule's 5 mg/m3 PEL for wood dustis already being achieved in hardwood casket making. The Agency's reasoningis as follows. First, OSHA believes that the results gathered by the CMAAfor this rulemaking are more representative than the historical samplingdata because they are more recent and generally involved longer samplingperiods. Second, OSHA believes that these results reflect wood dust levelsduring hand or machine finishing operations because it is these operationsthat the CMAA is concerned about from the technological feasibility perspective.Third, an analysis of these recent results shows that, even using the worst-caseassumption that employee exposures continue at the reported levels forthe entire work shift (a highly unlikely exposure scenario), 7 out of 9results would be below 5 mg/m3 as 8-hour TWAs. For example, the median8-hour TWA exposure level for this group of samples under this worst-casescenario would be 2.34 mg/m3.For these reasons, OSHA finds that hardwood casket manufacturers are alreadyachieving the final rule's PEL of 5 mg/m\3\ in almost all cases, even intheir dustiest operations (hand and machine finishing). Because Westernred cedar is not used to make caskets, the Agency concludes that no casketmakers will be affected by the final rule's 2.5 mg/m\3\ PEL for this allergenicwood dust. Thus OSHA finds no technological reasons for casket manufacturersto have difficulty complying with the final PEL for wood dust.<T3>SIC 42_Motor Freight Transportation and Warehousing</T3>Grain elevators whose primary income derives from the storage of grainare classified in SIC 42. Employees working in these elevators, have thesame kinds of exposures as workers in other types of elevators, which areclassified in SIC 51. OSHA's reasoning on the technological feasibilityof achieving the proposed grain dust limit in all grain elevators is discussedfully in the technological feasibility section for SIC 51, below.SICs 40, 45, 47_TransportationCleaning and coating operations are conducted in rail (SIC 40), and airtransport industries (SIC 45), as well as in transportation services (SIC47). These operations require the application of cleaning agents and/orthe sandblasting of particles prior to the application of paints or coating.Spraying processes are required for the application of both the cleaningagents and the paints and coatings. Rail car applications, for example, are generally performed within a largefacility, part of which is established as a spray room. The cars are rolledinto an enclosed spray area. In manual spray painting rooms, the operatoris required to enter and move about the enclosure during spraying. Automaticspray rooms (or booths) are similar but the pressurized spray guns areautomatically operated.Three major spray techniques are used to apply cleaning agents, coatingsor paints. These are: compressed air spraying (low-pressure spraying);airless spraying (high-pressure spraying); and electrostatic spraying.The compressed air spray gun atomizes a stream of liquid by impaction witha jet of air. Atomization may take place inside or external to the gun.The air stream and paint droplets intersect the prepared surface. The airlessspray gun atomizes the liquid by forcing it through a small orifice underhigh pressure. The resulting particulate cloud is impelled by the pressure-createdmomentum toward the surface. Electrostatic spray equipment is based uponthe attractive force between two oppositely charged objects. The liquidis atomized by compressed air, airless, or electrostatic techniques. Theparticles are given either positive or negative charge and the conductivesurface to be sprayed is grounded. In general, electrostatic spray techniquesresult in the lowest exposure levels, followed by airless and then compressedair spraying.In enclosed spray rooms, particulates enter the operator's breathing zonedue to backspray. Exhaust ventilation to control exposure can be designedusing down draft or a multiple sidedraft system. Worker positioning inrelation to the spray plume is also critical in minimizing exposures. Theseinclude minimized line pressure, changing and cleaning of filter banks,enclosure integrity and ventilation maintenance. Personal protective equipmentis also generally worn to insure the worker protection.The industry representatives did not challenge the technological feasibilityof the proposed PEL's. However, the Air Transport Association did objectto the six month compliance period established by OSHA because of the uniquecharacter of the industry and the time required to establish proper controls[Ex. 3-1122]. OSHA recognizes this difficulty but believes that the sixmonth/five year phase in period for complying with this rule, addressesthis objection.SIC 49_Electric, Gas, and Sanitary ServicesCoal-fed power plants present the potential for exposure to coal dust aswell as a number of other substances. Coal dust exposures potentially occurin the area where coal is fed into the furnaces. The coal is generallyfed into large hoppers off conveyors. Conveyors are filled by front-endloaders from the coal storage area. The operators of the front-end loadersare protected from coal dust exposure with the use of closed, air-conditionedcabs which provide purified breathing air. Evidence was presented by the Edison Electric Institute regarding technologicalfeasibility during intermittent exposures. Dr. Louis Hosek, representingEEI, argued that ``Many intermittent exposures occur in situations whereengineering controls are likely to be substantially less feasible, bothtechnologically and economically, than respirators, personal protectiveequipment, and work practices'' [Tr. 8/11/88, pp. 228, 229).This would clearly be the case in the tasks of cleaning the boilers andprecipitators at electric power plants. Installing engineering controlsto reduce exposures inside boilers would not be feasible. A power plantvisited for this rulemaking had installed deluge systems for the precipitatorsto wash down as much fly ash as possible before workers could enter thearea for cleaning or maintenance. Workers had to wear protective clothingand respirators when they cleaned the precipitator areas even after thewash system was employed [Ex. 11]. These tasks are occasional, performedmaybe four times each year as the opportunity arises when the boilers areshut down. The crews used to perform the cleaning are as large as is practicalso that the duration of the operation will be minimized. This is a maintenancesituation where engineering controls would not feasibly achieve the exposurelevel and supplementary respiratory use is appropriate under OSHA's traditionalpolicies.The Edison Electric Institute questioned whether OSHA had found that compliancewith the PEL for ozone was technologically feasible in the electric utilityindustry [Ex. 133, Tr.  8/11/88, pp. 232-233]. However, the Gulf PowerCompany, an electric utility, stated that, ``Normal operating procedureswould prevent exposure exceeding 0.3 ppm, since most operations occur inwell ventilated environments'' [Exs. 3-938, 3-1144]. Therefore, OSHA concludesthat the PEL for ozone is feasible.SICs 50 and 51_Wholesale Trade Some firms in this classification receive liquid chemicals in bulk quantitiesfrom a tank truck, store them and then redistribute them in smaller containers.Solvents, for example, emit considerable vapor when poured from one containerto another or when a container is being filled, displacing the air in it.Pouring and filling operations are often enclosed to minimize vapor losses(this helps to reduce product loss as well as prevent exposures). In addition,secondary vapor recovery is often incorporated, whereby vapors emittedat the transfer points are captured and returned through a separate circuitto the storage tank from which the volatile liquid is being removed. Grain dust exposures in this sector occur during grain handling operationsin wholesale grain elevators. The majority of commenters on the technologicalfeasibility of the proposed 4 mg/m\3\ PEL for grain dust (oats, wheat,and barley) maintained that this limit is not being met currently and cannotbe met with available engineering controls [Exs. 8-55, 3-77, 3-201, 3-343,3-347, 3-496, 3-1119, and 3-1196]. Typical of these comments is one fromthe Union Equity Coop Exchange, which stated that ``over $9 million hasbeen spent to install dust collection equipment in the facilities UnionEquity currently operates. Thousands of dollars are spent monthly to maintainand operate this equipment. Many of these systems are state-of-the-artdesign for functional operation. None of these systems would allow anyof our facilities to meet the proposed 4 mg/m\3\ exposure level'' [Ex.3-343, p. 2]. Edward X. Junia, Esq., representing the Andersons ManagementCorporation, was more specific: ``there are certain operations in everygrain-handling facility where there are no technically feasible engineeringcontrols to reach such a level. The regular unloading and cleaning of storagebins/buildings and the housekeeping activities required under other OSHAstandards are two areas where compliance through engineering methods isvirtually impossible'' [Ex. 3-77, p. 2]. OSHA does not agree that no controls are available to handle employee grainexposures during these operations. For example, in-plant vacuum systems(Farant and Moore, ``Dust Exposures in the Canadian Grain Industry,'' <T3>AIHAJ</T3> 1978, pp. 177-193) would reduce exposures during housekeepingand maintenance; this control method should be used in lieu of manual sweepingor compressed air cleaning, two housekeeping methods that are still widelyused in grain elevators (Ex. 3-751, Attachment, Docket H-0117). Employers owning elevators that are operated in connection with feed mills(SIC 20) have found that the use of aspirators with filtration systemsis highly effective in controlling grain dust during loading and unloadingoperations in receiving areas (Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-73). To deal with theproblem of grain dust in older mills, owners are replacing old-fashionedwooden legs with ``good, tight, enclosed steel legs . . . old facilities. . . that had open grain drag conveyors . . . have been replaced in manycases with enclosed-type conveyors . . . the conveying systems that usedto be open have lids on them . . . to keep the dust where it belongs''(Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-80). Such enclosure is recommended by industrial hygienistswhenever workers must work in dusty environments. For some facilities, oil suppression of dust may be a useful control measure.An oil mist, which consists of mineral oil, vegetable oil, or some combinationof the two, is normally applied when the grain is received at the mill.Ralph Mourer, testifying for the American Feed Industry Association, statedthat oil suppression of dust is a promising control that he has just installedin his feed mills. Although he has not yet had much experience with thesystem, he noted: ``[P]eople I've talked [to] and discussed the systemwith are very pleased'' [Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-78]. In an earlier study ofgrain-handling facilities for OSHA, however, Arthur D. Little, Inc., notedthat there are some limitations to this process: <ITAG tagnum="21">Mineral oil is not approved for use as an additive on food gradesof grain by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Vegetable oil may bean allowed additive, but its use can cause the grain to adhere into massesin cold climates. Further, there is concern that the oil will become rancidor create a commercially objectionable odor'' (Docket H-0117, ADL, p. VI-34).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Scott Bjornsom from Hunter Grain in North Dakota also reported thatoil suppression cannot be used for malting barley ``because of the absorptionwith the water in the malt process'' (Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-85). Despite somelimitations on its use in elevators, oil suppression appears to be an effectivecontrol for many elevators. OSHA notes that the grain dust exposures of employees working in grainelevators classified in SIC 51 are sometimes below the 10 mg/m\3\ (thegrain dust limit in the final rule) at the present time. A recent NIOSHstudy reports that only five percent of samples in the mills surveyed exceeded10 mg/m\3\ (Rankin et al. 1986), and a NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluation froma Cargill elevator showed many sampling results that were below 10 mg/m\3\or only slightly above this level (NIOSH HHE 76-13-316). These exposurelevels are being achieved despite the fact that most grain elevators donot now have pneumatic dust control systems (RIA for the Grain Handlingstandard). After considering the comments received on the proposed level, the controlsavailable to reduce exposures and the impact on certain segments of theindustry, OSHA has set the PEL for grain dust at 10 mg/m\3\. OSHA believes that the controls described above, which are being installedin many elevators at the present time in response to the recent promulgationof OSHA's grain-handling standard, the recommendations of insurers, andthe industry's concern for worker safety and health [Tr. 8/10/88, p. 10-73],are capable of achieving the 10 mg/m\3\ limit in those facilities and operationsthat are not now achieving this level. Industry representatives have reportedthat these systems have several additional benefits for employers; theyimprove productivity, have a positive effect on the quality of the grain,and create a better working environment [Tr. 8/10/88, pp. 10-80 and 10-81].Thus, OSHA concludes that a variety of control strategies are availableto employers operating grain elevators and these controls are installedin many elevators at the present time. The Agency finds that implementationof these controls will achieve the final rule's grain dust limit of 10mg/m\3\ in those elevators and areas that have not already achieved thislevel. SIC 72_Personal ServicesTo control dry cleaning emissions (SICs 7216, 7217), louvered wall fansand grilled ducts were installed to provide ventilation. Ceiling exhaustfans provided general ventilation. Natural ventilation was provided bythrough doors in the production area and by louvered panels along wallsin the plant. Forced ventilation was provided by ceiling mounted exhaustfans and evaporative coolers. A local exhaust system with a standard singlefloor pickup exhausted air through a carbon absorption unit to the outside.Gaskets in machinery doors and ductwork needed routine maintenance to preventdeterioration. Various cleaning machines, pressure filter extractors anddryers were used. Dryers and drying cabinets were provided with local exhaustventilation.In addition to the controls mentioned above, information has been reportedby the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) which indicatesthat exposure to perchloroethylene is reduced when using the unitary dry-to-dryequipment (10.7 ppm for operator) as opposed to transfer-type dual washer/dryerequipment (58.4 ppm for operator) [Tr. 8/5/88, pp. 159-186]. ACTWU estimatedthat over 100,000 workers are exposed to perchloroethylene on a routinebasis in the apparel cleaning industry. According to the 1982 Census ofService Industries, there were 13,049 dry cleaning plants in the U.S. thatused perchloroethylene, with total employment of 89,896 workers. ACTWUcalculated that approximately two-thirds of these workers are exposed inplants using transfer equipment, and one-third of these workers are exposedto perchloroethylene in plants using dry-to-dry equipment [Ex. 8-31]. TheACTWU also commented on the feasibility of reducing the exposure of perchloroethyleneto substantially less than the 50 ppm proposed standard. Mitchell Brathwaite,an industrial hygienist representing the ACTWU, stated that OSHA ``couldreasonably propose a much lower PEL. . . . For instance, NIOSH reportedthat [the] mean exposure for 80 percent of [the] plant[s] study [studied]were below 50 ppm. In fact, machine operators in these plants had meanexposures of 22 ppm'' [Tr. 8/5/88, p. 190].NIOSH determined that ``the `combination washer/dryer' machines significantlyreduce worker exposure to perchloroethylene when compared to exposuresfor separate or `scanter' equipment'' [Ex. 150]. Mr. Brathwaite furthercited that based on NIOSH data (the Ludwig study) and Mount Sinai Hospital'sDivision of Occupational Safety and Health Data, ``exposures could be reducedbelow ten ppm'' in the dry cleaning industry with the utilization of thedry-to-dry equipment [Tr. 8/5/88, pp. 203-204].The International Fabricare Institute (IFI) supported the proposed revisionof the PEL for perchloroethylene at 50 ppm. They stated that approximately64 percent of the dry cleaning industry uses dry-to-dry equipment, andthat over the past four years about 95 percent of all new equipment soldhas been dry-to-dry equipment [Ex. 3-671]. This indicates a continuingincrease from 1982 when 35 percent of the firms had dry transfer machines.Based on this trend and the belief that all machines purchased in the futurewill be of the dry transfer type, all equipment in the dry cleaning industrywill be dry-to-dry equipment. This will be accomplished through the normalreplacement cycle. The ACTWU [Exs. 153G, 192] reports that the machinerycensus in Michigan for the period 1983-1988 indicates ``there was a 34%increase in dry-to-dry machines, and an 11% decrease in transfer machinesduring this period. These data demonstrate vividly that replacement oftransfer equipment with dry-to-dry equipment is not only technically feasible,but is indeed the economic choice of employers.''According to the testimony of Mr. William Fisher, vice president of IFI,the ambient perchloroethylene concentration in the cleaning area of a drycleaning shop is approximately 20 to 30 ppm. The concentration decreasesto approximately 10 to 15 ppm in the finishing area (at a range of approximately15 to 20 feet from the cleaning area) to 1 to 3 ppm at the counter. ``Therecan be some variations in those numbers. However, Ludwig's study from NIOSHindicated the same numbers as did the Westinghouse Behavioral ResearchCenter study * * *'' [Tr. 8/5/88, p. 281]. The actual concentration towhich a person would be exposed is dependent upon the ambient environmentalconditions and the ventilation characteristics.Ludwig addressed the issue of engineering controls in dry cleaning facilities:<ITAG tagnum="21">The dryer is a closed system while in operation and the PCE-ladenair leaving the dryer is passed over a water-cooled condenser for solventrecovery before the air is reheated and recirculated through the tumbler.. . . The processing equipment, whether a combination unit or separatewashers and dryers, has interlock systems which insure that there is exhaustventilation pulling air into the machines and out through ducting wheneverthe doors are opened. The recommended air velocity in through the loadingdoor is an average of 100 feet per minute across the entire door opening.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An activated charcoal adsorber is often added to the control schemeto remove PCE from the air exhausted from the washer during loading andtransfer, and the dryer tumbler when the textiles are being aerated (deodorized),from the air intakes in the processing area, and from the vents of themuck cookers or stills. . . . The collection efficiency of the activatedcharcoal is extremely high (greater than 99%) up until breakthrough; however,if the adsorber becomes saturated, all PCE collected by the ventilationsystem will pass directly through the charcoal. It is for this reason thatthe adsorber should be vented to the outside of the building.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Local exhaust ventilation in the processing area is also ducted tothe adsorber. Ideally, the air intakes are between the level of the equipmentdoors and the worker's breathing zone. However, due to the mistaken notionthat since PCE vapors are heavier than air they collect on the floor, mostlocal exhaust intakes are at floor level; PCE vapors are likely to be foundin high concentrations near the floor only if there has been a spill. Alongwith reducing PCE levels in the processing area, the use of local exhaustwhen ducted to the adsorber tends to cool the charcoal bed, thereby increasingits adsorption efficiency. Another type of ventilation utilized in somefacilities is a low velocity fan 7andmin16; to 9andmin16; above the floor directedtoward the center of the processing area. This concept, when combined withgeneral room ventilation in which the fan is located on the wall or ceilingbehind the dry cleaning area, results in reduced employee exposures notonly to PCE but also to heat and humidity. A complete room air change every5 minutes is recommended. Engineering controls such as exhaust ventilationof process equipment vented to a charcoal adsorber, local exhaust in thedry cleaning area, fans, and general room ventilation all contribute tolower ambient PCE concentrations. Also important is an active maintenanceprogram. Typical sources of PCE vapor leaks are the button trap and thedoors of the washer, dryer, cooker, or dryer lint trap. Most of these localizedleaks are avoided by replacing door gaskets and adjusting the springs andhinges on the doors. Improperly seated air-inlet dampers on the dryer (usedduring aeration) and ducting are other potential sources of PCE emissions[Ex. 8-31, Appendix 13].</ITAG>Data compiled by NIOSH, the dry cleaning industry, the ACTWU, and independentinvestigators demonstrates that virtually all employers can achieve exposurelimits lower than the 50 ppm originally proposed by OSHA by using existing,readily available control technology. OSHA concludes, therefore, that a25 ppm standard for perchloroethylene is feasible.SIC 73_Business ServicesBlueprinting and photocopying firms (SIC 7332) control ammonia fumes fromblueprint duplication machines through use of local exhaust ventilation.The exhaust system is often built into large, high volume machines. Improvementsin work practices control exposures during transfer.The blueprint reproduction process uses ammonia to develop the image onthe finished reproduction. Some machines are designed to contain the ammoniaand its vapors; others are vented to the outside atmosphere. However, theodor of ammonia is present around the machines, especially where copiesexit the machine and are trimmed [Tr. 8/5/88, p. 216, p. 228, p. 236].Mr. Lucas Seeman, representing the Association of Reproduction MaterialsManufacturers, discussed a survey conducted in 1975-1976 of 75 blueprintingmaterials installations to determine levels of ammonia exposure found duringblueprint reproduction. This survey found that, ``the dominant part ofthis group was well under 25 ppm.'' Mr. Seeman stated that higher levelsmight occur ``at the export end of some of the machines where the paperis coming out'' [Tr. 8/5/88, pp. 228, 229]. OSHA concludes that local exhaustwould be sufficient to bring these ``export end'' work stations into compliancewith a 35 ppm STEL.SIC 55,75_Automotive Repair Shops, Dealers Exposure to carbon monoxide presents the major hazard in these industries.To control this in automobile engine reconditioning lines (SIC 7538), exhaustfans and flexible ducts which extend directly over the engines have beeninstalled. OSHA received no comments on the proposed rule from this sector.SIC 76_Miscellaneous Repair Services Many repair services involve welding. In addition to techniques suggestedin the discussion on welding and brazing in SICs 34 and 38, another controltechnique for welding fumes in SIC 7692 uses a ``smoke exhaust'' weldinggun which captures and removes fumes. These guns have some limitationsand are applicable to continuous or semicontinuous flux core or metal inertgas welding operations. Crossdraft airflow has also been suggested. Theuse of a portable fan is not recommended. OSHA concludes that it is feasibleto control exposures to the final levels. There were no docket comments on any aspect of this rulemaking for thissector. SIC 80_Health Services Many medical and dental practitioners perform surgery in outpatient clinicsand private offices outfitted for the procedure. Air contamination in anoperating room may consist of waste anesthetic, the propellants of differentsprays, scrubbing agents, cleansing agents, ethylmethacrylate (releasedfrom surgical cement) and the possible decomposition products of the volatileor gaseous agents. The magnitude of gas flow, type of flow circuit andscavenging of waste gases significantly influence the levels of waste gasesin the room air. Exposures are usually controlled by general dilution ventilation.Some clinics and offices, which are specifically designed for surgicaluse, may have local exhaust systems installed. Glutaraldehyde is used in a limited number of applications, rather thanas a general disinfectant. Specific applications include use as a disinfectingagent for respiratory therapy equipment, bronchoscopes, physical therapywhirlpool tubs, surgical instruments, anesthesia equipment parts, x-raytable-tops, dialyzers and dialysis treatment equipment. Presently thereare no safer disinfectants which are as effective as glutaraldehyde. Based on NIOSH Health Hazard Evaluations [1], OSHA concludes that the proposedceiling limit for glutaraldehyde of 0.8 mg/m\3\ (0.2 ppm) is technologicallyfeasible. NIOSH states that those facilities and areas where exposuresare below 0.2 ppm achieve these levels through the use of ventilation.NIOSH has found that through a combination of work practice improvementsand engineering controls, levels below 0.2 ppm can be achieved. Specificrecommendations include using increased dilution ventilation in whirlpoolrooms and x-ray rooms, along with the careful application of the glutaraldehydewith a long-handled brush, rather than a spray applicator. NIOSH also recommendsthe construction of a workstation (similar to a lab hood) for cleaningsurgical instruments and equipment parts. OSHA received no comments on the impact of the proposed rule on facilitiesin this sector. <ITAG tagnum="81">Personal Protective Equipment </ITAG>In the operations and processes included in Table F-4 reductions in exposurelimits can be achieved through engineering controls and work practice modifications.However, certain generic work activities are more problematical and mayrequire the use of personal protection equipment. OSHA recognizes in 29CFR 1910.1000(e), that respiratory protection can be an important adjunctto engineering controls. Because of specific task and process considerations,it may sometimes be necessary to augment engineering controls with theuse of respiratory protection.<ITAG tagnum="66">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M</ITAG>024<ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 1826 andamp; 1827 1800-1823</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="66">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Exterminating:</T3> Exposure of pesticide applicators cannot be controlledthrough engineering controls because their work does not take place ina fixed place of employment, but rather at a customer's facility.

Employees exposed to substances withthe ``Skin'' notation would be required to wear protective equipment, includinggloves, long sleeved shirts and coveralls.

In some cases the permeability of currently used materialsmay be inadequate and firms will have to change the specific product nowused to one offering greater protection. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 1826-1827</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C  </ITAG>Examples of these are:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Maintenance Activities in all SIC codes.</T3> In certain cases, itmay be more difficult to control exposures of plant maintenance personnelby using engineering controls.

Costs of Compliance Costs of compliance result from the purchase, installation, operation andmaintenance of equipment to maintain workers' exposures at or below thelevels specified in the final standard. Costs are related to the engineeringcontrols and personal protective equipment needed for specific processeswhich involve the use of hazardous substances. Given the large number ofsubstances being regulated, the cost assessment was required to examinea large number of processes over many industry segments. The approach neededto be generic in scope and specific in detail. OSHA has reviewed this approachand the resulting cost analysis and incorporated extensive public testimonyand voluminous docket submissions. The Agency concludes that the costspresented in this chapter accurately reflect industries' requirements forcompliance. Existing data sources and expert judgment were initially used to sort theapproximately 430 substances being regulated, by industry and by processwithin industry segments. Given the large number of substances being regulated,a process of orientation rather than a chemical-specific focus was recommended,since prescribed engineering controls can address worker exposure problemsto several chemicals, involving the same general process, simultaneously.The approach has proven to be efficient analytically and reduces the problemof double counting the costs of similar or the same engineering controlsfor separate chemicals involved in the same process or operation. OSHA had a large amount of exposure data in its Integrated Management InformationSystem (IMIS) and from NIOSH and other sources. But to improve the availableinformation on the use of substances, OSHA decided to engage in a nationwidefield survey of affected establishments. This survey, involving about 5,700establishments in both manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors, hasprovided valuable information on chemical usage by industry process andpotential worker exposures to these chemicals. Supplement 1 contains adescription of the sample survey design and a statistical evaluation ofthe data collected. In order to maximize the efficiency of this nationwide sample survey andlimit the number of required sample observations per SIC category, a considerableeffort was made to verify chemical by industry usage from existing datasources and to make best estimates of where likely or potential workerexposure problems (and consequently engineering costs) existed. For thepurposes of the statistical survey being conducted, the larger the suspectedpotential exposure/cost problem in a particular industry sector, the moreimportant it was to insure a large enough sample of firms in that sectorso as to reduce the standard error of the cost estimates. The following sections of this chapter outline the methodology adoptedto identify: <ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Chemicals by their industrial usage and employee exposures</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Processes involving known or suspected chemical exposuresand control costs </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Industry costs for the controls needed to reduce industryexposure levels. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Linking Hazardous Substances by Industry Use and Employee Exposure</ITAG>Figure G-1 presents a flow chart of the methodology used for identifyingchemicals by industry use and employee exposure. The first step in themethodology was an analysis of the chemicals for which OSHA proposes newexposure limits. The 1982 NIOSH National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES)and the OSHA IMIS data files were searched to determine the potential forworker exposure to each of the chemicals on the proposed list. The objectiveof this analysis was to create a subset of chemicals which are known tobe present in specific industries at exposure levels above the proposedlimits. These chemicals would then be considered to generate potentialcompliance costs within a specific industry sector. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 01830A </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>The 1982 NIOSH National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES) data (supplementedby results from NIOSH's 1972 survey) provided an estimate of the numberof workers potentially exposed to a specific chemical in a four-digit SIC.OSHA divided this estimate by the total number of employees in an industrysegment to get a percentage of workers potentially exposed to that chemical.If 5 percent or more of the workers were potentially exposed, that chemicalwas considered to present a potential cost within the four-digit SIC. Forexample, in SIC 3011, Tires and Innertubes Manufacturing, 1,532 personswere potentially at risk of exposure to n-hexane at the sample of plantsincluded in the NOES database. This represented 21.9 percent of all workerssampled in the four-digit industry sector and this chemical would havea potential cost impact depending upon current exposure levels. From the OSHA IMIS data, the severity of exposure within a four-digit SICwas estimated. OSHA compared the total number of monitored readings foreach chemical with the number of readings which exceeded the proposed limitsand calculated the percentage of all sample monitor readings which wereabove the proposed limits. If there were no readings which exceeded theproposed limits, the chemical was not considered to have a compliance costwithin the four-digit SIC. If 5 percent or more of the readings exceededthe proposed limits, then the chemical was identified as having a potentialcompliance cost within the four-digit SIC. For example, in SIC 2641, PaperCoating and Glazing, 22 samples were taken for n-hexane. Thirteen of these,or 59 percent, were above the proposed standard for n-hexane. This chemical,therefore, was believed to have a potential cost impact and questions regardingits use were included in the field survey. Chemicals with non-compliancepercentages between zero and 5 percent were evaluated individually by industrialhygienists to determine whether or not specific survey questions neededto be asked about their industrial usage. In addition to the IMIS and NOES databases, a survey of about one dozenindustrial hygienists was conducted. The purpose of this survey was toidentify any additional hazardous substances or industry sectors not identifiedin the IMIS or NOES databases with potential exposure problems at new recommendedlevels. For example, in SIC 2891, Adhesives and Sealants Manufacturing,the surveyed industrial hygienists reported that n-hexane overexposurescould exist under the proposed standard. (Overexposures in SIC 2891 werenot previously identified in the IMIS or NOES databases.) The information from all sources was combined to compile a preliminarylist of substances with potential compliance costs by four-digit SIC classification.To further refine the list of chemicals, a second group of six industrialhygienists, using personal industry knowledge and the information gatheredfrom the survey of the initial group of industrial hygienists, reviewedonce again the chemicals which appeared in the NOES and IMIS datasets.They also made chemical by industry use linkages when particular chemicalswere known to be present in certain SICs, but had not been identified inthe NOES and IMIS databases.Upon completion of the two-tier industrial hygienist review, a list ofchemicals believed to be present at exposure levels above the proposedstandard, within specific four-digit SIC industry sectors was finalized.This list identified those industry segments where potential compliancecosts would be incurred to achieve the proposed standards. The presenceof the identified chemicals was confirmed by survey respondents. The methodused during the survey listed likely chemicals and asked for any otherchemicals present.<ITAG tagnum="81">Industrial Processes and Control Costs</ITAG>The number of industrial processes, exposure levels, and exposure controlsin place varies greatly within industry segments. In order to efficientlystructure the statistical sample of surveyed firms, it was necessary tomake a best estimate of which industry segments were likely to experiencecompliance costs. As noted above, the survey was designed to limit thestandard error for potential high cost industry sectors. To concentratethe survey on the potential high cost sectors, a process orientation wasadopted which supplemented and refined the chemical use information. Thevalidity of this approach was confirmed in the review of docket materials.The vast majority of submissions that addressed industry costs linked processoperations with compliance cost. Industry sectors having few processesand chemicals and low potential exposure levels (and consequently low potentialcompliance costs) were included in OSHA's secondary data collection andevaluated by experts, but not included in the sample survey.A team of engineers and industrial hygienists analyzed each four-digitSIC to assess the process in which worker exposure to listed chemicalsoccur. Examples of industrial processes included grinding, mixing, spraying,degreasing, separation, bagging and loading. A list of potential cost chemicalsand related processes was then developed to identify potentially high impact(cost) industries. The presence of the identified processes was confirmedby survey respondents. The method used during the survey listed likelyprocesses and asked for other processes ongoing at the establishment. Ingeneral, an industry segment with a relatively large number of processesusing chemicals with suspected high exposure levels was sampled at thethree-digit industry level. Industries with fewer processes and low chemicalexposures were sampled at the two-digit level. (See Supplement 1 for amore detailed explanation of the survey design.)Approximately 5,700 respondents in the survey were asked to verify thechemicals used, manufactured or generated by process within their establishment.Thus, chemicals were linked to specific processes, process controls andworkers exposed at the process in the surveyed industries. Control methodsand costs were then assigned for each process where employee exposureswould exceed the proposed PELs.Controls were assigned to protect workers exposed to all chemicals in totalat a process. The controls were designed and costed to lower exposure tothe chemical(s) with the greatest change in the permissible exposure limit(PEL). It was the judgment of the experts involved that by assigning controlsfor the ``major'' chemicals, exposures for all other chemicals would becontrolled. Chemicals and/or processes not included in the proposed standard(e.g., those covered by separate 6(b) rulemaking) were excluded from thesurvey. Examples of chemicals not included in the survey are asbestos,formaldehyde and benzene.Survey information collected from each respondent included:<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Type of processes at the establishment;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Type and amount of chemical used, manufactured, or generatedin each process;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Number of work stations and workers related to the process;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Potential chemical exposure above the proposed standards(monitoring data, recorded overexposures) at the process;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Process location (indoors/outdoors), and configuration (size,full enclosure, partial enclosure);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Ventilation or other controls in place; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Economic and other characteristics of the plant.</ITAG>A computer algorithm was developed to assess survey data to determine ifpotential worker overexposure and therefore compliance costs occur foreach process at an establishment. Figure G-2 presents a general diagramof the computer logic adopted for use in the survey. The logic assessespotential overexposures on the basis of: actual reported monitoring data;statements that overexposures occur; and the particular process location,configuration, type and amount of chemical use and existing controls inplace.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 1837-1838</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>When a respondent provided actual monitoring data for a process that indicatedchemical exposures above the proposed standard, compliance costs were assignedto that process on the basis of prescribed controls for the given process.Where no monitoring data or reports of overexposure were available, thecomputer algorithm logic examined process and chemical characteristicsto determine if workers at the process were potentially exposed to chemicalsat levels over the proposed standard. The logic assessed the controls reportedto be in place at the process and compared them with a list of controlsthought necessary to control exposures in that process within the industry.When the required controls were reported to be in place, no compliancecost was assigned. When the required controls were not reported to be inplace, a compliance cost per work station was assigned. The computer algorithm determined that some processes within plants hadno overexposures and consequently no compliance costs. Zero compliancecosts resulted where no processes and/or chemicals were reported to occurat the establishment. Zero compliance costs also resulted when the respondenthad monitored a process using ACGIH or NIOSH standards and found no overexposures.When only very small quantities of chemicals were present in a process,none of which had a ``major'' proposed exposure limit changes, no overexposurewas determined and zero compliance costs were assigned. The major/minordesignation was based on the proposed change in the PEL (over or undera 50 percent decrease) as well as chemical characteristics such as form,particle size, and vapor pressure. Process configurations and location also were indications of compliance.Processes which were reported as completely enclosed with no worker entrywere assumed to be in compliance with the proposed standard (have no compliancecost). Outdoor loading/offloading processes or other outdoor/processeswith no chemicals with ``major'' proposed exposure limit changes were assumednot to require control equipment and costs. Zero compliance costs werealso assessed where processes which required control equipment reportedthat the prescribed equipment was currently in place. An example of a process which was assigned a cost of compliance to installengineering controls is a coating and spraying process in SIC 2511, WoodHousehold Furniture. The survey respondent reported that toluene, n-butylalcohol and xylene were used in this operation. The proposed standard fortoluene reduces the existing PEL by 50 percent. This reduction is consideredto require concerted exposure control and is considered a ``major'' proposedexposure limit change. Because workers were involved in the process andthe process was reported to be neither located outdoors nor fully enclosed,controls were assumed to be necessary to insure compliance with the proposedstandard. The control required for controlling exposures at this processwas determined to be local ventilation. The type of local ventilation prescribedin this case is a spray booth at an estimated cost of $3,070 annually perwork station. Because the respondent reported no local ventilation, thecost was assigned for the eight work stations reported, resulting in atotal estimated annual cost of $24,560 for this process at this site. Expert engineering and industrial hygiene judgment was used to determinewhich of the various controls would be necessary to control for exposuresby process in the affected industries. Engineering controls identifiedincluded exhaust ventilation (local and general), process enclosure, andprocess change. Some of all of these will be required by affected plantsfor compliance with the proposed exposure levels. In addition, personalprotective equipment such as respirators will be needed for intermittentmaintenance activities where engineering controls are not feasible. The engineers and industrial hygienists classified the approximately 180specific processes identified in the survey into about 30 process groupsfor the purpose of assessing required controls and estimating costs. Theseprocess groupings were based on similarities in the processes and levelsand types of exposures resulting from the processes. Factors used to groupprocesses include the chemicals generally involved in the process, typeand usual configuration of the equipment, usual workstation design, leveland route of exposure, industry group where the process exists and workertasks in relation to the equipment and exposure route. The process similaritiestranslated into likenesses in required controls such as type of ventilationhood, booth or enclosure, air flow rates, duct configuration and type andsize of filters or scrubbers. Organizations presenting process data tothe docket that varied from that derived by OSHA are referenced in thespecific industry descriptions in this chapter. The compliance cost frameworkis presented in Table G-1. This table presents the process groups, theindustries where the processes were identified, the general classificationof controls specified and work station unit costs for the required controlsassigned.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M004</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 1842-1845</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>The development of unit costs for each control configuration required thedevelopment of ``model'' control designs. Model control configurationswere selected to provide exposure control at ``typical'' process/work stationswithin the specified process group. This costing approach (``model'' configurationsfor ``typical'' work stations) required the differentiation of some processgroupings as major or minor. The major/minor differentiation addressesthe expected level of control required. The control designs were developed by engineers based on their experiencein industry and extensive secondary research on operations and exposuresituations in each industry sector. This research included an examinationof industry and industrial hygiene journals, engineering process reports,and texts. Included in the detailed cost calculations for the control configurationswere costs for enclosure construction, baffles, fans, ductwork, filters,scrubbers, baghouses, and all other equipment required for exposure control.All of the costs were developed on a per work station basis so that anaverage size did not need to be estimated for the process. Investment costswere assigned to each control design on the basis of engineering handbooksand supplier catalogs. Investment costs were annualized over the projectedlife of equipment (10 years) using a 10 percent cost of capital and addingannual operating and maintenance costs estimated at 10 percent of the capitalcost. Respirator costs for use by maintenance workers for intermittentactivities were considered annual costs and include the respirator purchaseas well as an estimated year's worth of cartridges and canisters. Process control costs were summed per establishment and any maintenanceworker respirator costs were included. A total annualized capital costand annual operating cost was developed for each establishment. Costs forthe survey establishment were then weighted (by SIC and size) to representcompliance costs for the universe of affected plants. The United Auto Workers (UAW) International Union contended that the OSHAanalysis ``establishes a far outer bound'' for the costs of compliancefor several reasons [Ex. 197]. Two reasons claimed by the UAW are thatthe survey failed to account for the current state of control of processunits and that not all process units would require the full applicationof the control schemes specified in the OSHA analysis. These potentialproblems were explicitly considered in developing the estimation methodand the method was designed to minimize the effects of these factors. Questionsin the survey <T3>did </T3>ask about the controls in place for every process. But themere presence of controls does not assure the ability to achieve proposedlevels. OSHA believes that the assignment of full control costs to uncontrolledprocesses, although not always necessary, is approximately offset by notcosting, in all situations, the upgrading of insufficient control systemsalready in place. The UAW also contended that ``OSHA has refused to collect readily availableexposure data which would have supported the feasibility of much lowerPELs.'' On the contrary, OSHA solicited exposure data in two ways, as wellas searching for data from public agencies. In addition to asking for datain the public hearings and for submission to the docket, every survey respondentwas asked to provide exposure data. In addition, data in OSHA's IMIS database,in NIOSH reports and in journal articles were used. The fourth point made by the UAW to support its position that costs wereoverestimated is that ``The ongoing replacement of plant and equipmenthas not been accounted for.'' OSHA did consider this factor where informationwas available which allowed a quantitative assessment of the effect itwould have on compliance, such as in dry cleaning, although it could notbe considered in all areas of industry. Finally, the UAW disapproves of the method by which unit costs were estimated,claiming that OSHA's approach ``degrades the value of the analysis by obstructinggeneralization. In addition, past cost estimates have been sensitive toa per cfm cost of ventilation. The present evaluation fails to presentsuch a cost.'' Estimation of costs on a per cfm basis was avoided becauseOSHA felt that better estimates could be made by estimating more detailedunit costs. Rather than having only one per cfm cost, the OSHA analysisuses 30 control scheme costs which are able to take into account differentcharacteristics of both the process equipment and the chemicals being controlled.OSHA believes that this method creates the ability to estimate costs muchmore accurately than a per cfm estimate would allow across the broad spectrumof industries and processes which this rule affects. The per cfm basisof cost estimation was not used because it would require much <T3>broader </T3>assumptions about average characteristics of control systemssuch as ductwork, baghouses, etc. OSHA views its method as an improvementon the previous methods because this method requires fewer generalizationsand assumptions and allows the inclusion of more information in estimatingcosts. <ITAG tagnum="81">Compliance Costs by Industry Sector </ITAG>Following the methodology described in the preceding section of this chapter,annual compliance costs were estimated by industry sector. The costs presentedfor the surveyed industries are based on the data collected from the about5,700 respondents. (For industries not included in the survey, expert judgmentand secondary sources were used for estimating costs.) Table F-4 (shownat the end of the chapter) presents the detailed breakdown of compliancecosts for each industry sector included in the survey. The table illustratesthe processes reported in the survey, the number of work stations by process,and the number of work stations determined to require the addition of compliancecontrols. The process and work station frequencies are weighted to reflectthe total universe of affected plants. A small percentage of respondents (less than 5 percent) actually providedmonitoring data during the survey. However, based on information from thesurvey, it was determined that about 86 percent of all establishments inthe surveyed industries (74 percent of those with hazardous substances)have no exposures in excess of the final standard and will not incur anycosts to comply with the standard. This conclusion was derived by comparingcontrols in place with controls deemed necessary to reduce exposures tothe regulated limits. Thus a cost was assigned if the existing ventilationsystem was estimated to be insufficient to control these chemicals at thenew levels. About 22 percent of establishments with hazardous substanceswill incur costs to provide engineering controls for processes within theplant. About 4 percent of the establishments with hazardous substanceswill be required to provide personal protective equipment only for maintenanceworkers whose intermittent operations cannot be controlled with engineeringcontrols. Table G-2 presents the total annualized capital and annual operating costfor compliance with the standard by industry. As shown, annual compliancecosts are estimated to total $788 million. Upon review and incorporationof all docket materials, OSHA believes that these costs are fully representativeof costs of compliance with the standard. These costs represent an estimateof compliance costs for large and small plants affected by the exposurelimit changes. Industries with some anticipated cost impact are identifiedbelow. Included in the industry description are data provided to OSHA duringtestimony at the public hearing and in the docket submissions.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 1850</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>In addition to review of submitted materials, OSHA also undertook a sitevisit survey of about 90 plants to examine and compare data collected bytelephone and in the field. Various statistical tests were performed onthe telephone survey and site visit data to detect biases in the cost algorithm[Supplement 1]. These analyses tested the hypothesis that the telephonesurvey did not systematically differ from the site visits in the numberof estimated firms out of compliance and the actual cost assigned to thosefirms. Using a 95 percent confidence interval, these tests revealed noaggregate bias in the assignment of costs by the telephone survey as comparedto the site visits.<T3>Food and Kindred Products (SIC 20).</T3> Costs are projected for alarge number of establishments in this sector. The prepared feeds and feedingredients, not elsewhere classified (SIC 2048), are estimated to accountfor a large percentage of the $33.5 million annual costs in SIC 20. Controlsmay be necessary for dust exposures and chemical fumigants.Two commenters provided detailed cost estimates for firms to achieve theAgency's proposed grain dust limit of 4 mg/m3: the National Grain and FeedAssociation (NGFA) [Ex. 3-752] and the National Feed Industry Association(NFIA) [Tr. 8/10/88, pp. 10-61_10-69].The National Grain and Feed Association provided alternative cost estimatesfor feed mills and for flour mills. These estimates were based on the followingassumptions:1. All affected facilities will need pneumatic dust control systems anddo not now have them;2. Only 13 percent of food mills handle wheat, oats, or barley, and thusonly 13 percent will be affected by the grain dust limits; and 3. The costs of pneumatic dust control systems are the same as those estimatedby Booz Allen in a 1984 study conducted for OSHA in connection with theAgency's grain handling standard (these costs were inflated by 15 percentto convert them from 1984 to 1988 dollars).Using these assumptions, the NGFA concluded that the capital costs of compliancefor all feed mills would be $213 million and for all flour mills wouldbe $81 million [Ex. 3-752]. If these costs are annualized using OSHA'sinterest-rate and life-of-equipment assumptions, annualized costs for feedmills (using a 10-percent operating cost figure) would be $56 million peryear, and annualized costs for flour mills would be $21 million per year.Average annualized costs per affected feed mill would be $44,000 per yearand per affected flour mill, $225,000 per year.The NFIA also provided estimates of the total costs of compliance for feedmills. The NFIA's costs were based on an evaluation of 20 existing feedmills; the NFIA, therefore, only attributed costs for pneumatic dust controlsystems to facilities that do not now have them. Thus, the NFIA study attemptsto take into account baseline controls; it reported that 5 of these 20mills had some level of dust control in place. The NFIA estimated thatthe capital costs of compliance for all feed mills would be $664.5 million[Tr. 8/10/88, pp. 10-61_10-69]. If OSHA's interest rate and life-of-equipmentassumptions are used and operating costs are assumed to be 10 percent ofcapital costs, annualized costs for all feed mills would be $175 millionper year. Average annualized costs per affected feed mill would be $22,000per year.OSHA's Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis (PRIA), published with theproposed rule, estimated costs for all facilities in SIC 20 to comply withthe proposed PELs; the grain dust portion of this overall cost was basedon the assumption that affected facilities would have to meet a 4-mg/m3PEL for grain dust. Based on health effects and economic feasibility considerations,the Agency has changed the grain dust levels to 10 mg/m3 TWA. OSHA's analysisshows that the great majority of employee exposures are at or below 10mg/m3, and thus, few additional controls will be needed to achieve thefinal rule's limit of 10 mg/m3. OSHA believes that the cost estimates forthis sector are conservative and probably overstate the costs that affectedemployers will be required to expend to achieve the 10 mg/m3 limit.Several comments were received from employers in SIC 201, Meat Products,who were concerned that the proposed limit of 1 ppm for carbon disulfidewould force the manufacturers of the cellulosic casings that are made infacilities classified in SIC 3089, Miscellaneous Plastics, to go out ofbusiness [Exs. 3-421, 3-659, 3-897; Tr. 8/2/88, pp. 4-209, 4-261]. In theopinion of these concerned meat packers and processors, the impact of thecarbon disulfide limit on firms in SIC 3089 would be so great that alldomestic supplies of the cellulosic casings needed by the meat packersand processors would disappear. These commenters were particularly concernedbecause there are no substitutes for cellulosic food casings except naturalcasings, which can only be used for cooked sausage and cannot be used withautomatic machinery [Ex. 3-897].The costs anticipated by the meat packers and processors were presentedin a study conducted by Wharton Economic Forecasting Associates (WEFA)[Ex. 3-659]. WEFA forecast a loss of 12,000 to 20,000 jobs in meat processingand 12,000 to 16,000 jobs in meat packing, and also projected an 8 and16 percent reduction in the price paid to farmers for cattle and hogs,respectively [Ex. 3-659].WEFA based its forecast on the following assumption: that processed meatsdependent on cellulosic casings would disappear from the marketplace altogether[Ex. 3-659]. OSHA finds this scenario unlikely, since the cost impactsin SIC 3089 are likely to be greatly reduced because the Agency has establisheda 4 ppm limit, rather than the proposed 1 ppm limit, for carbon disulfidein the final rule. Domestic production of casings should not cease or bedisrupted in a major way.OSHA concludes that the concerns of the meat packers and processors inSIC 201 have been addressed and their supplies of cellulosic food casingsshould not be disrupted.The National Cotton Council of America [Ex. 3-1080] expressed the concernsof its members over the difficulty small, rural cottonseed mills wouldhave in sampling their employees' exposures to hexane and grain dust. Asdiscussed above in the section on Technological Feasibility for SIC 20,OSHA determined that sampling and analytical methods are available forthese contaminants and that consultant industrial hygienists can be employedby mill owners on an as-needed basis. OSHA is aware that the services ofcompetent and experienced industrial hygienists can be obtained for feesbeginning at $300 per day and that laboratory fees for analysis range from$20 to $40 per sample, depending on the substance being analyzed. OSHAdoes not believe that costs of this magnitude will have a significant impacton cottonseed mills.Although carbon dioxide exposures in the beer industry were described as``unique'' [Tr. 8/9/88], the principal sources of exposure are blow-outsof safety valves, opening of tank doors, and entry into tanks for cleaning.For both blow-outs (an upset condition) and tank entry (a maintenance operation),OSHA permits the use of respiratory protection to meet the PEL. Exposuresresulting from opening tank doors can be reduced by implementing the workpractice of cracking the door and remaining out of the area for a few minutesto allow the CO<T2>2</T2> to dissipate. Since the final rule establishes an 8-hour TWAof 10,000 ppm, rather than the 5,000 ppm proposed, OSHA concludes thatthe cost estimates presented in the PRIA for SIC 20 do not need to be revisedand include all potential costs of compliance for breweries.The Corn Refiners Association (CRA) estimates that the wet corn millingindustry would incur $24,097,000 in capital costs, with annual operatingcosts of $6,244,000 million, to meet the proposed 2- and 5-ppm SO<T2>2</T2> standard. Of this, CRA estimates that $12,809,000 in capitalcosts and $3,266,000 in operating costs would be incurred to meet the 5-ppmSTEL, and $11,288,000 in capital costs and $2,878,000 in operating costswould be incurred to meet the 2-ppm PEL [Ex. 65, Tab 13, pp. 7-8].OSHA notes that 47 percent of CRA's estimated costs are attributed to meetinga STEL. However, the record indicates that short-term excursions do nottypically occur during normal operations; instead, they occur during maintenanceactivities and in emergency conditions. In these situations, the standardpractice in the industry is to use respiratory protection [Tr. 8/8/88,p. 8-90], as would be permitted by OSHA.Furthermore, OSHA's technological feasibility assessment shows that the2-ppm TWA and 5-ppm STEL can be achieved in all routine operations in thissector with the addition of a small amount of make-up air (or by openingthe windows in warmer months). Employers in this sector also need to reducethe number of process upsets and maintenance problems in their plants byinstituting manual leak detection programs, improving maintenance, replacingpump seals before they leak, and phasing out outdated process equipment.Evidence in the record reports that the volume of production and saleshas risen so quickly that control equipment has been unable to keep pace[Ex. 65, Tab 13, p. 7]; this sector should therefore not have difficultyabsorbing the negligible costs associated with the minimal control proceduresneeded for this sector to achieve compliance with the final rule's limitsfor SO<T2>2</T2>. CRA notes that its estimates of costs constitutes 18.3 percent of OSHA'stotal cost estimate for all chemicals in all parts of SIC 20. OSHA notesthat, generally, within a 2-digit SIC industry group, most industry sectorsare estimated to incur minimal costs to comply with the final rule, anda few industry sectors will incur higher costs. Thus, even assuming thatCRA's estimated costs are accurate, OSHA's aggregate estimate for SIC 20are not necessarily substantially understated. Thus, OSHA concludes thatthe cost estimates presented in the PRIA for SIC 20 do not need to be revisedbased on the record evidence pertaining to the potential costs of compliancefor wet corn milling. <T3>Tobacco Manufactures (SIC 21).</T3> The lowest cost of compliance inthe manufacturing sector is expected to occur in SIC 21, Tobacco Manufacturers,($20,000). It is estimated that very few plants will incur costs in thetobacco manufacturing industry. <T3>Textile Mill Products (SIC 22) and Apparel and Other Finished Products(SIC 23).</T3> These sectors have a large number of establishments whichmay incur compliance costs. The apparel industry is estimated to incurabout $31.7 million in annual compliance costs. Many of the affected establishmentsin SIC 23 may require controls for cleaning solvents such as perchloroethylene.The $29.5 million annual costs in the textile industry are estimated toresult from control of exposures to solvents, dyes and other substances.No differing cost estimates in opposition to OSHA's cost calculations werepresented in the docket or testimony. <T3>Lumber and Wood Products (SIC 24).</T3> The annual costs of compliancein the lumber and wood products industry are estimated to total $56.7 million.The compliance costs for this sector primarily reflect the cost of controlsrequired to lower exposures of wood dust to 5 mg/m3 (2.5 mg/m3 for Westernred cedar wood). The survey indicated that sanding and other ``dusty''processes would require controls to lower wood dust exposure. The largenumber of establishments that must engineer ventilation systems for wooddust control account for the substantial proportion of compliance coststo be incurred by small establishments in this sector. OSHA's estimates in the preliminary analysis were based on a standard of5 mg/m3 for softwood and 1 mg/m3 for hardwood, using survey responses forparticulates not otherwise regulated as a surrogate for wood dust. In determining the total cost of compliance for wood dust at the finalPEL of 5 mg/m3 (2.5 mg/m3 for Western red cedar), OSHA carefully considereddata presented in to the record by National Economic Research Associates(NERA), Clayton Environmental Consultants, the Workers' Institute for Safetyand Health (WISH), the Holliday report, and numerous other government,union, and industry respondents [Exs. 3-748, 8-127, 8-196, Tr. 8/18/88,p. 13-5, etc.]. Researchers from Clayton Environmental Consultants andNERA, on behalf of the Inter-Industry Wood Dust Coordinating Committee,performed a study on the impacts of the proposed air contaminants ruleon SICs 24 and 25 [Exs. 3-748, 8-127]. NERA concluded that it would costfirms in SICs 24 and 25 $266 million annually for a 5 mg/m3 standard forall woods. Under a 1 mg/m3 standard for all wood dust, NERA estimated thatcosts would exceed $1.9 billion annually and under the proposed standardof 5 mg/m3 for softwood and 1 mg/m3 for hardwood, annual compliance costswould be approximately $1.5 billion. NERA's estimate of $1.5 billion wasmore than four times higher than OSHA's August  1st estimate of $341 millionannually for a 5 mg/m3 softwood standard, 1 mg/m3 hardwood standard [Ex.38a]. Mark Berkman, repsesenting NERA, testified that the cost discrepanciesbetween the OSHA study and their estimates were due to the differencesin unit costs and in the number of work stations out of compliance in SICs24 and 25 [Tr. 8-12-88, p. 107, 111]. OSHA determined that annual unit costs of compliance per work station of$1,900 for cutting/sawing/planing, $2,200 for sanding/polishing and grinding,and $2,200 for drilling/boring are the best estimates currently availableto comply with the final standard. These unit costs are not significantlydifferent from the unit costs presented in the Clayton study. (The unitcost presented by NERA in one case does not accurately reflect the findingsof Clayton Environmental Consultants. Apparently the cost applied to the``belt sander'' in the NERA study was derived for ``sander, belt (widebelt)''in the Clayton study. However, the cost developed for ``sander, edge''would have been more appropriate. ``Edge sander'' was never identifiedin the NERA survey. The cost for the widebelt sander is $50,800, whilethat for the edge sander is $12,900. The capital cost for control on abelt sander developed for OSHA was $8,000.) In analyzing NERA's methodology, there were significant differences betweenOSHA's estimates of costs and work stations when compared to NERA's. NERA'smethodology begins by surveying ``industry experts'' (via the Inter-IndustryWood Dust Coordinating Committee) to derive the number of machines in typicalsmall and large establishments. In a number of industries, these expertsestimated that there would be many more machines than total employees.For example in SIC 2426, NERA's survey respondents estimated that therewould be 32 machines in a ``typical'' small plant (fewer than 20 totalemployees). NERA's next step was to multiply the number of machines ina typical plant by the percentage of machines out of compliance from theClayton study. This revealed an estimated number of machines out of compliancein a typical plant at the four-digit level for small and large firms. Thisestimate of machines out of compliance was then multiplied by the per machineunit cost to arrive at an average cost per typical plant. Finally, thisnumber was multiplied by the number of plants reported in the 1982 Censusof Manufactures for each four-digit SIC in order to arrive at an aggregatecost. OSHA believes that its methodology for deriving total work stations ismore accurate. OSHA used a telephone survey which requested informationabout work stations specifically at the plants being interviewed. However,NERA sent surveys to ``industry experts'' who were asked to describe a``typical plant''. NERA never explains the number or identity of respondentsin its survey. However, it is important to note that NERA received no responsesin numerous four-digit SICs (large plants in SICs 2429, 2491, 2515, 2517,2519, 2531, and 2541 and small plants in SICs 2436, 2451, 2452, 2491, 2512,2515, 2517, 2531, and 2541). For industries with no response rate, a weightedaverage cost was used as a surrogate. In the case of SIC 25, 10 of the16 size and industry categories were derived by using surrogates. Thusnon-surveyed industries such as mattresses and bedsprings were estimatedto have the same costs and work stations out of compliance as surveyedindustries with high wood-dust-generating processes such as wood and upholsteredfurniture. The cost surrogate used for these 10 categories in SIC 25 isthe third highest per plant cost, despite the fact that it was derivedwithout specific exposure data by Clayton or estimates of machines usedin a typical plant for these specific four-digit SICs. OSHA conculdes thatsuch extrapolation is based on less comprehensive data than the 1988 telephonesurvey. This widespread use of surrogates partly explains why total workstations has been overestimated by NERA. Additionally, OSHA concludes that NERA's survey estimates of total machinesis high, and therefore the number of machines out of compliance is overestimated.Including those four-digit SICs where surrogates are used (and thereforetotal estimated number of machines is implied), NERA assumed a total ofapproximately 800,000 machines in SICs 24 and 25. This estimate is roughlyequivalent to the number of employees in these two SICs. The statementby NERA that ``. . . workers (or work stations, assuming one worker perwork station)'' [Ex. 3-748, p. 13] implies that NERA does not find it unreasonablethat 800,000 wood-dust-generating machines are used continually by everyworker in SICs 24 and 25. OSHA concludes that its estimate of 300,000 totalwork stations (200,000 wood-dust-generating work stations) as derived fromthe 1988 telephone survey, is a more accurate estimate. OSHA's site visitsand survey indicate that there are far fewer work stations than workersin SICs 24 and 25. One cause for this difference is the amount of shiftwork performed, thus allowing one work station to be used by two or threeworkers in a single day. Another cause for this difference is the numberof technical, clerical, managerial, and maintenance staff, many of whomdo not work consistently around machines which generate substances regulatedunder this rulemaking. Thus OSHA has determined that its estimate of totalwork stations is an accurate assessment for firms in SICs 24 and 25.Next, it was necessary for OSHA to derive the percentage of wood-dust-generatingprocesses (sanding/polishing/grinding, cutting/sawing planing, and drilling/boring)out of compliance with the final standard in SICs 24, 25, and 26. OSHAcombined its monitoring data from site visits with Clayton's samples toestimate that 16 percent of the wood-dust-generating work stations (includingthose involving Western red cedar) would be out of compliance with thefinal standard. This percentage seems to be reasonably close to the 13.5percent figure for 5 mg/m3 from the OSHA Health Response Team Survey referencedby Scott Schneider of the Workers' Institute for Safety Health (WISH) [Tr.8/15/88, p. 13-5].Since a 2.5 mg/m3 standard was established for Western red cedar, OSHAperformed a separate analysis on compliance cost for this substance. OSHAbelieves that there are approximately 290 firms involved in the productionof shakes and shingles with Western red cedar in SIC 2429 [U.S. Departmentof Commerce, Office of the Census]. Studies on Western Red Cedar asthma[Ex. 82D, Captain James J. Edwards, Jr.] indicate that approximately 90percent of these firms operate in Washington State, where the permissibleexposure limit is currently 2.5 mg/m3. Data presented by Stephen Cant ofthe Washington Department of Labor andamp; Industry indicated that ``theycan, in fact, in most cases, comply with those limits, and that there arestudies that support, certainly I think, the 2.5 limit as regards allergenicwood dust with respect to Western red cedar.'' [Tr. 7/29/88, p. 2-103].However, studies performed by the University of Washington in 1987 indicatethat ``Labor and industries inspectors found a large number of mills outof compliance with the new regulatory standards.'' [Ex. 127.H] OSHA assumedthat compliance with the wood dust standard relative to Western red cedarin the shakes and shingles industry would not be significantly differentfrom compliance with the overall wood dust standard. OSHA concluded that16 percent of the work stations would be out of compliance with the finalstandard in the shakes and shingles industry.To derive the cost for wood dust in SIC 24, OSHA estimated that 142,000of the 215,000 total work stations are wood-dust-generating, and that 1,500involve Western red cedar. Sixteen percent, or 23,000, of the wood-dust-generatingwork stations were determined to exceed the final standard (240 for Westernred cedar). Wood dust thus accounted for $45 million of the $56 millionin SIC 24. For reasons explained above concerning the total number of workstations and work stations affected, OSHA concludes that NERA's estimateof $137.1 million for a 5 mg/m3 standard is an overestimate.In addition to wood dust, controls for exposures to solvents, wood preservatives,and other chemicals in coating processes are estimated to result in compliancecosts in SIC 24. Overall, about 68 percent of all establishments in SIC24 are estimated to incur compliance costs. OSHA thus concluded that theannual operating and annualized capital cost to comply with all standardswould be $56.6 million in SIC 24.<T3>Furniture and Fixtures (SIC 25). </T3>Annual costs of compliance inthe furniture and fixtures industry are estimated to total $21.1 million.Costs to control wood dust exposures at 5 mg/m3 wood (2.5 mg/m3 for Westernred cedar) during sanding, cutting, drilling, and other dusty processesare the major components of compliance costs in this sector. Establishmentswould also incur costs for control of exposures to coatings and solvents.The survey indicated that the furniture sectors which include metal working(SICs 2514, 2515, 2522, 2542, 2591 and 2599) would also require controlsfor welding fumes and various metal particulates resulting from grindingand other processes. OSHA believes that local exhaust ventilation willreduce exposures to permissible levels during welding operations.OSHA again believes that NERA overestimated the costs and the number ofwork stations used in its cost estimations for SIC 25. An explanation ofcost differences is provided in SIC 24. OSHA calculated 89,000 total workstations (57,000 at wood-dust-generating work stations) in the furnitureindustry, based on responses provided by the telephone survey. NERA's estimateof work stations, which relied heavily on surrogates, resulted in a significantoverestimate of the number of total work stations and work stations outof compliance with the OSHA standard. This overestimation of the totalnumber of work stations distorted NERA's cost estimates for SIC 25 ($128.9million for a 5mg/m3 standard).To derive the cost to control wood dust exposures in SIC 25, OSHA estimatedfrom the 1988 telephone survey that 57,000 of the 89,000 total work stationswould be wood-dust-generating. Sixteen percent, or 9,000, of the wood-dust-generatingwork stations were expected to exceed the final standard. Wood dust thusaccounted for $19 million of the compliance cost in SIC 25. OSHA believesthat its total cost estimate of $21.1 million is an accurate estimate ofthe actual cost of compliance for this sector.<T3>Paper and Allied Products (SIC 26).</T3> Annual costs in the paperand allied products industry are estimated to be $31.0 million. Much ofthe estimated costs in SIC 26 will be associated with the cost of controlsin large pulp mills and associated operations. Pulp mills are operatedseparately (those listed in SIC 2611) or as part of paper or paperboardmills (SIC 2621 and SIC 2631 respectively). Some of the cost of compliancein these operations would result from controlling the large quantitiesof chemicals used in breaking down the pulp to form cellulose and the reactionsthat occur in the digesting process. The digesting and bleaching operationsrequire ventilation or enclosure.A portion of the costs associated with SIC 26 relate to controlling exposuresto wood dust levels at 5 mg/m\3\ for wood dust (2.5 mg/m\3\ for Westernred cedar). Data presented on wood dust exposures by Clayton were derivedfrom only 2 site visits in SIC 26. NERA presented no cost estimates forthis industry. Thus OSHA retained its estimate that sixteen percent ofall wood-dust-generating work stations would be out of compliance withthe final standard in SIC 26. Data from the 1988 sample survey indicatedthat the total cost for this SIC would amount to an annual operating andannualized capital cost of compliance of approximately $31.0 million.<T3>Printing and Allied Industries (SIC 27).</T3> Compliance costs in theprinting industry sector (an estimated $33.8 billion) would result fromventilation requirements to control exposures to cleaning solvents andink spray generated within the printing process. A very large number ofsmall establishments are involved in printing and over 3,100 of them wouldbe affected by the revised standards. The survey indicated that a largenumber of small establishments currently lack exposure controls and provisionof these controls accounts for the high control costs in this sector. However,OSHA's field visits in this sector [Ex. 8-11] indicated that the unit costsinitially estimated for printing processes were somewhat high. The finalcost estimate was adjusted to reflect the information collected duringthe field site visits.<T3>Chemicals and Allied Products (SIC 28).</T3> Annual compliance costsin SIC 28 are estimated to total $35.5 million. Over 35 percent of thecosts in SIC 28 are estimated to occur in Paints and Allied Products Manufacturing(SIC 2851). The survey indicated that a large proportion of plants willrequire additional controls for a number of processes found in paint andpaint products manufacturing. There are many chemicals in this industrysegment which present exposure problems in a variety of both wet and dryprocesses, including reaction, separation, crushing, mixing, drying andbagging.According to U.S. Borax, the average annual operating costs for environmentalcontrols at Borax in SIC 2819, Industrial Inorganic Chemicals (NEC), isconsiderably higher than OSHA had predicted for a large plant. As an example,OSHA estimated operating costs of $18,000 per year for large plants inSIC 28. U.S. Borax estimated an average operating cost of $37,600 per year.[Tr. 8/9/88, 9-113.] It is not clear from the testimony or from submissionsto the docket [Ex. 3-744] which of the costs listed by Borax are associatedwith the mining and initial processing of the ore. These processes fallunder the jurisdiction of the Mine Safety and Health Administration. OSHAbelieves a significant portion of these costs estimated by Borax are associatedwith the mining operation rather than downstream activities. After reviewingthe rulemaking record, OSHA increased the TWA for all borates to 10 mg/m\3\and adjusted plant costs downward to reflect the change.Industry group SIC 282, Plastics Materials, Synthetic Resins and SyntheticRubber accounts for about 22 percent of compliance costs in this sector.Compliance costs are related to ventilation and other requirements to controlexposures to carbon disulfide, acetone and other emissions in the manufactureof rayon, cellulose acetate fibers and other plastics materials and syntheticrubber. The Vinyl Institute contended that a number of the processes foundin member companies would have to be modified at an estimated capital expenseof $10-25 million. The additional annual expense to maintain the requiredlevel of compliance was estimated by the Institute to be $4-5 million.The industry-wide estimated initial capital expense was estimated to be$160-400 million and annual expenses $60-80 million [Ex. 3-624]. The costestimates submitted by the Vinyl Institute included tank farm vent controlswhich OSHA, as explained in Chapter F (Technological Feasibility), concludeswould not be necessary. The remaining areas identified by the Instituteare loading/unloading operations and process sewer systems. While the costsare not presented in a disaggregated form, OSHA believes that the coststo bring these two areas into compliance would be only a fraction of theInstitute's total cost estimate and OSHA's estimated costs are more accurate.OSHA also notes that the final limits for several chemicals of interestto the Vinyl Institute (acetone, carbon disulfide) are less stringent thanthose proposed, which should mitigate cost problems for affected firms.In SIC 2823, Cellulosic Manmade Fibers, the Inter-Industry Committee onCarbon Disulfide asserts that ``the cost of making even small improvementsbelow the 20 ppm limit is significant_$16.6 million.'' These costs wouldbe for preventing the escape of carbon disulfide into the work area (processenclosures) and for increased ventilation [Ex. 3-747, p. 82). As explainedin the discussion of technological feasibility, OSHA believes that theevidence indicates the problem to be much less severe than is suggestedabove, and that most exposures are of short duration. The industry cancomply with the final carbon disulfide standard of 4 ppm by using respiratorsin a limited number of designated processes (see Chapter F, TechnologicalFeasibility) and adjusting work practices to control exposures. Costs forthis subsector are reflected in the total estimate for SIC 28. Also inSIC 2823, the manufacturers of cellulose acetate claim that compliancewith the acetone standard is not economically feasible at the three existingfacilities. Tennessee Eastman estimated that costs of compliance with theproposed standard of 250 ppm for acetone to be $11.2 million annually inits facility [Ex.     3-745]. Mr. Vernon G. Knight of Hoechst Celanese,estimated that the costs of compliance for its two facilities would total$40.2 million in capital costs [Ex.  3-745]. OSHA does not believe thatcosts of this magnitude will be incurred. OSHA has revised its originalproposal of 250 ppm for acetone. OSHA believes that a 750 ppm TWA and 1000ppm STEL is economically and technologically feasible, and the costs forthis sector have been reduced to reflect this change.For SIC 2892, Explosives, the Institute of Makers of Explosives mentions``a study conducted in one nitroglycerin/ethylene glycol dinitrate (NG/EGDN)manufacturing facility in which the concept of reducing workplace concentrationsto a 0.01 ppm (0.1     mg/m\3\) level was examined.'' This study indicatedthat the costs of engineering controls at this facility would exceed $4million (1979 dollars) in capital costs to achieve the proposed standardfor     NG/EGDN [Ex. 3-749, 190]. OSHA believes that the principal costfor SIC 2892 would be for air line respirators and this cost is includedin the total cost estimated for SIC 28.<T3>Petroleum Refining and Related Products (SIC 29).</T3> Although only13 percent of all facilities in SIC 29 are expected to be affected, nearly25 percent of the large refineries will incur costs. Of those firms withmore than 100 employees, almost 59 percent incurred some cost. Approximately90 percent of the $23.7 million annual costs in SIC 29 are expected tobe incurred by facilities in SIC 2911, Petroleum Refining. Most of thesecosts will be related to water treatment processes and sampling/qualitycontrol tasks because of a lack of controls in place in these two areas.In general, however, this industry has extensive control technology inplace for the primary processing equipment. Closed processes with few exposedworkers are predominant due to the requirements of process operation atelevated temperatures and pressures.Costs in SIC 2951, Paving and Roofing Materials, arise mainly from smallerblending and formulating operations which usually involve few employees.Packaging and loading/offloading processes account for the majority ofcosts in SIC 299, Miscellaneous Products of Petroleum and Coal. The remainderof costs in SIC 299 are attributable to the blending and formulating oflubricating oils and greases.<T3>Rubber and Miscellaneous Plastics Products (SIC 30).</T3> Annual costsof compliance in this industry sector are estimated to total about $111.1million. Controls were required for processes such as molding and vulcanizing.Worker exposure to chemical vapors require the addition of local ventilationto many processes. The miscellaneous plastic products industry (SIC 3079)accounts for over 20 percent of the annual costs in this sector. The costsin SIC 3079 result from the high proportion of small plants in this sectorwhich will incur costs of compliance. Controls are required in SIC 3079for many crushing and grinding operations used to prepare plastic materialfor hot processes.The Styrene Information and Research Council (SIRC) presented estimatesof the costs SIRC believes will be required to control styrene exposuresto a TWA of 50 ppm in selected segments of the miscellaneous plastics industry[Exs.   3-742, 34A, Tr. 8/3/88, pp. 117-130]. These costs estimates weredeveloped for SIRC by Arthur D. Little, Inc. (ADL) and represent a partialupdate of a large study done by ADL in 1980 on the costs and technicalfeasibility of styrene control. This updated study estimated costs forthe tub/shower, lavatory, hot tub/spa, and resin-applied-at-press segments.All of these segments are classified in SIC 308, Miscellaneous PlasticManufacturing. ADL estimated that total capital costs for these segmentsto comply with an 8-hour TWA of 50 ppm for styrene would be $1.169 billionand that operating costs would be $204.6 million per year [Ex. 34A, Table2]. Using OSHA's interest rate and life-of-equipment assumptions, the annualizedcosts for this sector, using these capital and operating costs, would be$395 million per year, a value in excess of the PRIA's total estimatedcosts of $75 million per year for all of SIC 30. ADL estimated that 19,230employees in these segments are exposed to styrene at levels above 50 ppm;according to ADL, there are a total of 48,885 employees in these segmentsat 1550 plants [Ex. 34A, Table 1]. OSHA finds several difficulties with the ADL study. First, ADL used theexposure data from its 1980 study for SIRC as the basis for estimatingwhat controls (and therefore costs) would be involved in achieving compliance;these exposure data showed considerably higher exposure levels (with oneexception) than more recent data, e.g., the Cal/OSHA study of styrene exposuresin this industry. ADL did use the Cal/OSHA data in one case (for the tub/showersegment), the only instance in which the Cal/OSHA exposure data were actually<T3>higher</T3> than the 1980 ADL data. Thus, ADL relied on the highestexposure data as a cost baseline, even when more recent data were available,and only used recent data when they were higher than the outdated data.This factor would contribute significantly to an overestimate of costs,especially since representatives of SIRC reported at the hearing that conditionsin the industry have improved considerably in the last 10 years [Tr. 8/4/88,p. 5-94]. Second, compared with other sources (SIRC's prehearing submittal, the Cal/OSHAstudy), ADL estimates that many more workers are overexposed to styrenein these reinforced plastics industry segments. For example, ADL [Table10, Ex. 34A] estimates that 20 percent of the workforce in the reinforcedplastics segments of concern is overexposed to styrene, while the Cal/OSHAstydy [Ex. 3-742, Attach. 2, p. 30] reports that only 22 percent of thegel coat/lamination workers (who constitute approximately 36 percent ofthis work force) are overexposed. Thus, ADL used an inflated estimate ofthe number of overexposed workers in these segments; this factor also contributessubstantially to an overestimation of costs. Third, ADL seriously underestimates the existing level of baseline controlin these segments. For example, ADL assumes that facilities have no controlsin place. However, as the Cal/OSHA study, SIRC testimony, and OSHA's sitevisits show, this is not the case. At the time of ADL's 1980 study, spraybooths may have been nonexistent in these facilities, but that is clearlynot the case today.Fourth, ADL underestimates the effectiveness of the methods available tocontrol exposure. For example, the Cal/OSHA study found that many facilitieswith only minimal levels of control were routinely achieving the 50-ppmlimit and that others that were exceeding 50 ppm could achieve complianceby adopting minor engineering improvements, implementing better/maintenanceprocedures, and instituting improved work practices [Ex. 3-742, Attach.2, pp. 20, 29-33]. Dr. Daniel Boyd, speaking for SIRC, testified to theeffectiveness of improved work practices (training workers to leave thespray booth when not involved in sprayup/layup operations, to positionthemselves properly during spray operations, etc.). Based on his experience,Dr. Boyd estimated that work practices alone could reduce employees' 8-hourexposures to styrene by 50 percent [Tr. 8/2/88, p. 5-106]. Fifth, ADL ignored control approaches based on substitution, preferringinstead to estimate that major revamping of ventilation systems and installationof local exhaust ventilation would be necessary in all facilities. OSHAis aware that other materials cannot be substituted for styrene in allapplications; however, a costing methodology that relies exclusively onengineering controls ignores the movement in this sector away from styreneand high-emitting resins. A series of methodological problems, which compoundeach other, seriously undermines the usefulness of the ADL study. The Agencybelieves it more appropriate to rely on OSHA's industrywide survey as asource of data and to use the cost algorithm as a method of evaluatingcosts in these sectors. OSHA therefore concludes that the costs reportedin the PRIA for SIC 30 are representative and reliable estimates.The limit of 4 ppm for carbon disulfide may not be achievable with engineeringcontrols in some operations performed during the manufacture of cellulosicfood casings (SIC 308). These operations include unloading xanthate fromthe baratte, aligning of casing strands in the extrusion cabinet, and puncturingcasings at the extrusion nozzle. Air-supplied hoods are currently usedby workers performing these operations, and OSHA finds that respiratorsare likely to continue to be needed in these three processes, which requirethe opening of process machinery. Because employers will be permitted touse respirators to achieve compliance during these three operations, OSHAconcludes that the cost estimates presented in the PRIA for SIC 30 accuratelyreflect costs for this industry.<T3>Leather and Leather Products (SIC 31). </T3>One of the lowest costsof compliance in the manufacturing sectors is expected to occur in SIC31, Leather and Leather Products ($2.4 million). In the leather and leatherproducts industry sector, most of the affected establishments produce manufacturedleather goods. The costs in this SIC are predominantly derived from gluingoperations.<T3>Stone, Clay, Glass and Concrete Product Manufacturing (SIC 32).</T3>The stone, clay, glass and concrete product industry is estimated to incurcompliance costs of about $22.5 million. A major part of the annual costsin this industry segment may occur in the concrete, gypsum and plasterproducts (SIC 327) industries. According to the survey, controls in thissector are primarily expected to control silica generated during largescale crushing, grinding and sizing operations. <T3>Primary Metal Manufacturing (SIC 33).</T3> The annual costs of compliancein primary metal manufacturing are estimated to total $71.0 million. Thecosts of compliance for this sector are heavily weighted by the cost ofcontrols required in large establishments in this segment. Blast furnaceestablishments and primary foundries have large numbers of hot processeswhich require controls. Control of emissions from these hot metal processesto the proposed levels will require large increases in the volume of airbeing moved through the ventilation systems. Additional costs will be incurredto increase capacities of scrubbers and baghouses to remove the contaminantsfrom the air.The $71.0 million estimate includes engineering controls for processeswhere none are currently in use, as well as additional control of somealready controlled proecesses. The controls for which costs have been estimatedare sufficient for essentially all of the facilities in this sector. However,this estimate may somewhat underestimate the compliance costs because itdoes not take into account the additional costs at a small number of verylarge facilities where these engineering controls may not be sufficient.This situation arises in SIC 3312 at the blast furnaces and basic oxygenfurnaces (BOFs) in the few (about 15) remaining integrated steel mills,which operate on a substantially larger scale than the other facilitiesin this sector. It is the scale of these approximately 15 operations (whichaccount for about 80 percent of domestic steel production) which requiresmore extensive controls than other facilities in this sector.Because engineering controls alone are likely to be insufficient to consistentlycontrol exposures to the proposed PELs around the blast furnaces and BOFsat the integrated mills, OSHA anticipates that respirators will be neededin addition to the engineering controls. Engineering controls could possiblybe installed to fully meet the proposed exposure levels, but the cost wouldlikely be prohibitive, about $10 million per facility. The estimated costof $71.0 million for this sector takes into account engineering controlssuch as improved air purification in control rooms and purified air showersat some work stations. These improvements would help to control exposures,but might not always be sufficient to meet the new standards. Thus, OSHAhas also included an annual cost of $7.41 million for respirators at theintegrated mills (included in the $71 million total estimate).<T3>Fabricated Metal Products Manufacturing (SIC 34). </T3>Plating andcoating establishments (SIC 347) and miscellaneous fabricated products(SIC 349) would account for a major portion of the $39.4 million annualcosts in SIC 34. Worker exposures in this industry sector result from chemicalsused in plating processes, solvents and coatings, metals and dusts. Thesurvey indicated that ventilation systems are not now present at many ofthe processes with chemical exposure.<T3>Machinery Except Electrical (SIC 35) and Electrical Machinery (SIC36). </T3>The machinery manufacturing sectors together are estimated toincur total annual compliance costs of $65.9 million. Machinery exceptelectrical accounts for $45.2 million of this total. The electrical machinerysector is estimated to require $20.7 million in annual compliance costs.Controls in these sectors would be required for exposures to metals, solventsand welding fumes. <T3>Transportation Equipment Manufacturing (SIC 37). </T3>Annual costsof compliance for SIC 37 are estimated at $49.8 million. Costs in the truckand car body and motor vehicle parts sectors (SICs 3711, 3713, 3714) wouldaccount for a large percentage of the costs in SIC 37. Controls may beneeded in order to control exposures to heavy metals, solvents, weldingfumes and a large variety of other chemicals at large scale hot processes.Additionally, costs in small plants in this sector will include complianceactivities to control exposures to styrene and other chemicals in smallboat construction, as well as trailer and recreational vehicle insulation.The Styrene Information Research Council (SIRC) presented the results ofa study by Arthur D. Little, Inc. (ADL) of the costs of meeting a 50-ppm,8-hour TWA for styrene in the boat-building industry [Exs. 3-742; 34A;Tr. 8/3/88, pp. 5-117 to 5-130]. The ADL study concluded that capital costsfor boat builders would be $714.3 million and operating costs would be$132.1 million per year [Ex. 34A, Table 2]. If these costs are annualizedusing OSHA's interest and life-of-equipment assumptions, annualized costsfor firms in this sector would be $249.2 million per year. OSHA's PRIAestimated a total annualized cost for all of SIC 37 (which includes manyother segments in addition to boat-building) of $47 million per year (53FR 21736). There is thus a substantial disagreement between ADL's chemical-and industry-specific estimate and OSHA's estimate for the entire sector.OSHA believes that ADL's estimates grossly overestimate costs for controllingstyrene in the boat-building sector. For example, ADL estimates that 50percent of all workers in this sector are exposed to styrene levels ofgreater than 50 ppm as 8-hour TWA's. However, Daniel Boyd, testifying forSIRC, estimated that not more than 20 percent of employees engaged in boatbuilding are directly exposed to styrene in the gel-coat and laminationprocesses; according to Dr. Boyd, the remainder of employees work in assemblyand shipping and have little direct exposure to styrene [Tr. 8/3/88, p.5-100]. OSHA's site visits to boat-building facilities in this sector [Exs.136A, 136B] confirm that no more than 20 percent of employees in boat buildingfacilities work in jobs having direct exposure to styrene. ADL also chose to use 1980 exposure data to construct an exposure baselinefor costs in this segment. OSHA finds that extensive exposure and controldata collected in the Cal/OSHA study [Ex. 3-742, Attach. 2] superior tothe 1980 ADL data because they are more recent, more extensive, specificallyrelated to control measures (both engineering and work practice), and reflectgood industrial hygiene practice (ADL, for example, calculates 8-hour TWAson the basis of 1- or 2-hour samples, while Cal/OSHA uses appropriate samplingtechniques). The Cal/OSHA study determined that the mean 8-hour TWA exposurefor gel-coat and lamination workers (who are the most heavily styrene-exposedemployees) were generally lower than reported by ADL. In addition to overestimating both exposure levels and the number of workersoverexposed, the ADL study [Ex. 33-742, Attach. 9, pp. 1-5] assumes thatan extensive system of engineering controls and work practices would berequired to achieve exposures of 50 ppm or less, i.e., ADL assumes a verylow (or nonexistent) baseline level of control. However, both the Cal/OSHAstudy and OSHA's site visits [Exs. 136A, 136B] show that most gel-coatapplication is being done today in a spray booth [Ex. 3-742, Attach. 2,p. 20], and that many gel-coat operators have 8-hour TWA exposures of lessthan 50 ppm. Further, based on the Agency's feasibility assessment for manual layupand sprayup operations within SIC 37, OSHA is permitting respirators tobe used during these operations to achieve the revised limits for styrene.Thus, it is unlikely that employers will incur substantial costs to implementengineering controls for manual layup and sprayup operations. Finally, ADL did not consider the impact of substitution of lower-emittingstyrene resins or of other, less hazardous substances in lieu of styreneon worker exposures. OSHA therefore concludes that the costs reflectedin the PRIA for SIC 37, which are based on data from the survey and estimatesdeveloped by the cost of algorithm, are an accurate representation of coststo firms in this sector. <T3>Instruments Manufacturing (SIC 38). </T3>Annual control costs in SIC38 are estimated to total $9.6 million. Exposures in this sector are toa large number of chemicals used within instruments and to various metalsand solvents. <T3>Miscellaneous Manufacturing (SIC 39). </T3>This industry accounts fora wide range of products, processes and chemical exposures. About halfof the establishments that would incur the $15.8 million annual cost inthe industry are believed to be included in SIC 3999, miscellaneous manufacturingnot elsewhere classified. The Casket Manufacturers Association of America (CMAA) commented that achievementof the proposed hardwood dust limit of 1 mg/m3 would impose prohibitivecosts on casket manufacturers [Ex. 8-78]. The CMAA presented estimatesof the costs it anticipates as a result of the proposed limit; these costswere derived by estimating per-machine ventilation costs, multiplying thisestimate by the number of machines per plant, and then multiplying by 18plants [Ex. 8-78]. The CMAA estimated costs from a zero (no control) baselineand from an incremental baseline [Ex. 8-78]. Because the use of a zero-costbaseline is not appropriate when estimating potential compliance costs,OSHA has focused on the CMAA's incremental costs. According to the CMAA,total costs for 18 companies to achieve a 1 mg/m3 limit for hardwood dustwould be $1.32 million, or $73,000 per plant. OSHA believes that the CMAA has seriously overestimated compliance costs.First, the final rule has adopted a 5 mg/m3 limit for wood dust (the 2.5mg/m3 Western red cedar dust limit does not affect casket manufacturersbecause they do not use this wood). Second, the CMAA estimates assume thatall machines in all facilities will need local exhaust ventilation, whenin fact only a few machines would need to be engineered since only hand-and machine-finishing operations present an exposure problem, accordingto the CMAA [Ex. 8-87]. Finally, the recent exposure data collected andsubmitted by the CMAA show that, even under a worst-case scenario, sevenof nine sample results were below the 5 mg/m3 limit (see detailed discussionfor SIC 39 in the Technological Feasibility section of the preamble). Theseexposure results demonstrate that most employees and operations are alreadybelow the final rule's 5 mg/m3 limit and will therefore incur no costs.Thus OSHA finds that the costs projected by the CMAA are unlikely to beincurred by hardwood casket manufacturers. The Agency's PRIA cost estimatesfor SIC 39 appear to be accurate and take into account costs of the magnitudelikely to be encountered by these manufacturers. One comment was received from a participant concerned about the costs ofachieving the proposed limit for styrene in the manufacturing of divingboards, a business that is classified in SIC 3949, Sporting and AthleticGoods (nec). This commenter [Ex. 3-380] was of the opinion that the equipmentchanges and plant restructuring required to comply with the proposed limitwould require a complete shut-down of affected facilities, and that thisclosure would result in such a substantial loss of revenue that economicfeasibility would become an issue [Ex. 3-380]. In response, OSHA notes that a review of the record evidence has shownthat the great majority of all exposure samples and reinforced plasticsfacilities potentially affected by the revised standard are already achievingcompliance with this limit or are very close to doing so (see discussionof Technological Feasibility for SICs 30 and 37). In those few cases wherecompliance is not presently being achieved, OSHA has determined that improvedwork practices, such as having employees leave the booth when not engagedin manual layup operations and having them stand downwind, and making minoradjustments in ventilation will achieve the final rule's PEL. Thus OSHAfinds that the cost impacts projected by this commenter [Ex. 3-380] arenot likely to be incurred by diving board manufacturers. <T3>Transportation and Utilities (SICs 40, 45, 47, and 49). </T3>The transportationand utilities sectors (SICs 40, 45, 47, and 49) include a large numberof establishments. However, operations at Railroad (SIC 40), and Air Transportestablishments (SIC 45) are subject to regulation by other Federal agenciesin addition to OSHA. Consequently, the number of establishments which wouldincur costs to comply with the final standard are limited. For railroads,OSHA's standards normally apply to off-track operations. The estimatedcost of compliance for SIC 40 is $1.1 million, while the cost for SIC 45is $3.7 million. <T3>Transportation Services Sector (SIC 47). </T3>The $3.8 million annualcosts in SIC 47 will primarily be incurred in SIC 4789, transportationservices not elsewhere classified. This sector includes establishmentswhich provide incidental services such as cleaning railroad ballast andother rail car maintenance.<T3>Electric, Gas and Sanitary Service Utilities (SIC 49). </T3>Annualcosts in the utilities sectors are estimated to total $38.0 million. Costswould result from installation and improvement of controls necessary foractivities such as boiler/furnace feed preparation in electric services,odorant addition by natural gas companies and water treatment and purificationof water supplies.Edison Electric Institute (EEI) estimates that in electric utility operationswhere exposures are intermittent in nature and limited in duration, engineeringcontrols to reduce exposure would likely cost one to two million dollarsper generating unit [Ex. 3-831]. However, intermittent activities suchas boiler and precipitator cleaning would not require the installationof engineering controls, so these costs would not be incurred. During theseintermittent activities, workers do have the option of wearing respirators.OSHA's cost estimate for SIC 49 does reflect costs to control exposuresto coal dust generated in material handling operations.The remaining cost estimate from EEI is $12-46 million per unit to modifythe approximately 428 positive pressure boilers currently operating inthe United States. EEI contends that if electric utilities lost their flexibilityin using personal protective equipment to meet the proposed PELs, the boilerswould have to be modified to reduce potential leaks of nitrogen dioxideand sulfur dioxide [Ex. 3-831]. OSHA believes that in most cases whereoverexposures might occur, they could be corrected by general ventilationor directed blowers and by correcting the most severe emission points.The prediction for such radical and costly modifications of power generatingequipment does not appear to be well grounded.The Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA) stated that coststo control ``exposure to emissions from combustion sources that are ductedto ambient air'' would be prohibitively costly [Ex. 3-739]. However, INGAAdid not provide any specific explanations as to possible errors in OSHA'scost analysis. Thus OSHA did not have any additional evidence with whichto compare its costs. After reviewing its methodology and survey data,OSHA concludes that the costs of compliance for the natural gas industrywere adequately represented.<T3>Wholesale Trade (SICs 50, 51). </T3>Costs in the wholesale trade sectors(SICs 50, 51), are estimated to total about $17.2 million annually. A largepercentage of the total number of establishments which would incur coststo comply with the final rule are in SIC 5093, Scrap and Waste Materials,wholesale.Several of the commenters who submitted data and information on the technologicalfeasibility of achieving the Agency's proposed grain dust standard of 4mg/m3 in SIC 5153, Wholesale Trade and Grain and Field Beans, also expressedconcern about the costs of compliance OSHA estimated for this sector inthe PRIA. The PRIA estimated that approximately 10 percent of the grainelevators classified in SIC 5153 would incur costs to meet the proposed4 mg/m3 PEL and that the average per-elevator annualized costs would be$6,000 per year (Ex. 33). OSHA's estimates were based on data derived fromthe survey and calculated using the cost algorithm.The National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) presented a different estimateof the compliance costs that owners of grain elevators in this SIC categorywould incur (Ex. 3-752) to reach the proposed 4 mg/m3 PEL. To derive itsestimates, the NGFA used the following assumptions:(1) All grain elevators processing wheat, oats, or barley will need pneumaticdust control systems and do not now have them;(2) Eighty-seven percent of all grain elevators process wheat, oats, orbarley;(3) The costs of pneumatic dust control systems are those estimated byBooz Allen in a study done for OSHA in connection with the Agency's grainhandling standard (inflated by 15 percent to convert them from 1984 to1988 dollars).Using these assumptions, the NGFA estimated total capital costs for allaffected grain elevators at $1.9 billion. If these costs are annualizedusing OSHA's interest and life-of-capital-equipment assumptions and includingan operating cost component calculated at 10 percent of capital costs,annualized costs would be $500 million per year, most of which reflectcosts for country elevators. If the NGFA's estimated capital costs areused as a starting point, the average annualized per-elevator cost wouldbe $41,125.OSHA finds that the NGFA's estimates seriously overstate potential compliancecosts for two principal reasons:(1) OSHA has determined, as described for SIC 51 in the Technological Feasibilitysection of the preamble, that the PEL established in the final rule willbe 10 mg/m3, rather than the proposed PEL of 4 mg/m\3\;(2) The NGFA overestimates the number of grain elevators potentially affectedby the new standard.OSHA believes that no more than 10 percent, rather than the 87 percentprojected by the NGFA, of all SIC 51 grain elevators will incur costs toachieve the 10 mg/m3 PEL, because most elevators are already achievingthis level. Data in the record show that:(1) Only 5 percent of 109 8-hour TWA samples taken in grain elevators inone study were above 10 mg/m3 [Rankin et al. 1986];(2) Fewer than 5 percent of 203 8-hour TWA samples from grain handlingfacilities characterized as ``small'' were above 10 mg/m<T9>3, Scrap and Waste Materials, wholesale.</T9>Several of the commenters who submitted data and information on the technologicalfeasibility of achieving the Agency's proposed grain dust standard of 4mg/m3 in SIC 5153, Wholesale Trade and Grain and Field Beans, also expressedconcern about the costs of compliance OSHA estimated for this sector inthe PRIA. The PRIA estimated that approximately 10 percent of the grainelevators classified in SIC 5153 would incur costs to meet the proposed4 mg/m3 PEL and that the average per-elevator annualized costs would be$6,000 per year (Ex. 33). OSHA's estimates were based on data derived fromthe survey and calculated using the cost algorithm.The National Grain and Feed Association (NGFA) presented a different estimateof the compliance costs that owners of grain elevators in this SIC categorywould incur (Ex. 3-752) to reach the proposed 4 mg/m3 PEL.

If these costs are annualizedusing OSHA's interest and life-of-capital-equipment assumptions and includingan operating cost component calculated at 10 percent of capital costs,annualized costs would be $500 million per year, most of which reflectcosts for country elevators. If the NGFA's estimated capital costs areused as a starting point, the average annualized per-elevator cost wouldbe $41,125.OSHA finds that the NGFA's estimates seriously overstate potential compliancecosts for two principal reasons:(1) OSHA has determined, as described for SIC 51 in the Technological Feasibilitysection of the preamble, that the PEL established in the final rule willbe 10 mg/m3, rather than the proposed PEL of 4 mg/m\3\;(2) The NGFA overestimates the number of grain elevators potentially affectedby the new standard.OSHA believes that no more than 10 percent, rather than the 87 percentprojected by the NGFA, of all SIC 51 grain elevators will incur costs toachieve the 10 mg/m3 PEL, because most elevators are already achievingthis level. Data in the record show that:(1) Only 5 percent of 109 8-hour TWA samples taken in grain elevators inone study were above 10 mg/m3 [Rankin et al. 1986];(2) Fewer than 5 percent of 203 8-hour TWA samples from grain handlingfacilities characterized as ``small'' were above 10 mg/m3 [Ex. 3-751, Attach.2 and Fig. 1, Docket H-0117];(3) Only 12 percent of all total dust samples taken at 6 elevators in 3states were above 10 mg/m3 [Ex. 3-751, Attach., Docket H-0117]; and (4) Only 6 percent of the employee full-shift exposures taken by NIOSHin a grain elevator were above 10 mg/m3 [NIOSH HHE 76-13-316].These data confirm that no more than 10 percent of all SIC 5153 elevatorswill be affected by the final standard. Further, these data make it clearthat controls will be needed only in those instances and areas where the10 mg/m3 is not already being achieved, and that the complete, facility-wideinstallation of pneumatic control systems envisioned by the NGFA to meeta 4 mg/m3 PEL will rarely, if ever, be required. OSHA has not reduced thecompliance costs included in the PRIA for this sector despite the increasein the PEL from 4 to 10 mg/m3; as such, costs are believed to be conservativeand may overstate actual expenditures needed to comply with the new level.<T3>Auto Dealers (SIC 55). </T3>The only retail trade sector expected toincur compliance costs, Auto Dealers (SIC 55) is estimated to incur $13.6million annually. These costs result from the potentially large numberof motor vehicle dealers (SIC 5511) which may incur compliance costs tocontrol exposures to paints, coatings and solvents during vehicle sprayand coating operations. The costs result from the installation of paintspray booths.<T3>Service Sectors (SICs 72, 73, 75, 76, and 80). </T3>The service sectors,SICs 72, 73, 75, 76 and 80 are estimated to total about $26.7 in annualcompliance costs. The major costs in these sectors would result from potentialcompliance activities in SIC 721, laundry, cleaning and garment services.Establishments in SIC 721 would incur annual operating and annualized capitalcosts to control exposures for dry cleaning operations. Because the limit for perchloroethylene was lowered from the proposed levelof 50 ppm to 25 ppm, the engineering control designed for dry cleaningwas reevaluated. OSHA reevaluated the control design used to project costin the preliminary regulatory impact analysis. The air flow rate to controlexposures at 25 ppm was increased, resulting in a unit cost increase of$910, making the revised unit cost $2,410. OSHA is aware of the improvementsin dry cleaning equipment, particularly the increasing use of dry-to-drymachines. Based on information provided by the International FabricareInstitute and the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union regardingreplacement rates for drycleaning machines, OSHA believes that virtuallyall machines in use will be dry-to-dry by 1992 [Ex. 3-671]. The averageperchloroethylene exposure associated with dry-to-dry machines is 23.9ppm. Thus, it is anticipated that the PEL will be met largely by the normalrate of retirement of existing equipment. Additional costs in the service sectors may result from control of solventchemicals in SIC 734, Building Services, control of welding fumes at WeldingRepair operations (SIC 7692), control of solvent and photographic chemicalsin Mailing, Reproduction, Commerical Art, Photography and StenographicServices (SIC 733), and local ventilation for exposure control in SIC 8071,Medical Laboratories. <ITAG tagnum="81">Per Plant Average Costs </ITAG>Table G-3 presents the estimated average per plant annual cost of complianceby industry sector. Costs shown in this Table are calculated only for thoseestablishments in a sector which would incur costs. Average per plant annualoperating and annualized capital costs for all affected establishmentsacross industry sectors are estimated at $6,000. The per plant cost forlarge plants is $13,000 and for small plants with fewer than 20 employees,$3,100.<ITAG tagnum="2"> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 1886A </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="66">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG> The highest costs on an average per plant basis are expected to occur inSIC 29.

Per plant costs in SIC29 are substantially higher than those in the next highest industry, SIC30, Rubber and Plastics. The $31,200 per plant costs in this industry resultfrom above average compliance costs estimated for exposure control in moldingand vulcanizing in large plants and crushing and grinding operations insmall plants. Although small establishments account for about 73 percent of the 131,005affected establishments, compliance costs for small establishments areexpected to account for only 36 percent of total industry compliance costs.<ITAG tagnum="66">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M </ITAG>019 <ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 01888-1906 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">References </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Dun and Bradstreet, Inc., 1985 Count of Establishments. (Database)</ITAG>H. Economic Impact, Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and Environmental ImpactAssessment <ITAG tagnum="81">Economic Impact </ITAG>The economic impacts discussed in this chapter have been estimated followingan analysis of data collected through a nationwide sample survey of about5,700 establishments. Two alternative polar assumptions were used in thisanalysis. andbullet; <T3>Perfectly Elastic Demand or Zero Cost-Passthrough: </T3>All compliancecosts are absorbed by the firm in the form of reduced profits. This assumptionis the ``worst case'' scenario, where the maximum reduction in pre-taxprofits to the firm (and industry) results. andbullet; <T3>Perfectly Inelastic Demand or Total Cost-Passthrough: </T3>All compliancecosts are passed on to the consumer sector in the form of higher prices.From the perspective of the firm, this is the ``best case'' scenario. Theresulting price increase would be the maximum theoretically possible. Two points should be noted. First, for the majority of industry sectors,neither assumed market structure would be accurate. In practice, the impactswill almost always produce a price increase smaller than the inelasticdemand projection and a reduction in profits smaller than that predictedunder perfectly elastic demand conditions. Second, increased firm productivitywould mitigate any adverse economic effects of the final standard. Productivityeffects would be related to reduced worker illness, absence and turnover.In addition, knowledge of improved workplace health conditions could resultin higher workforce morale and productivity. The firm would enjoy loweremployee training costs (due to the reduced turnover rate) and lower medicalbenefit and worker compensation claims. Overall productivity increaseswould be realized by firms that use a relatively fixed-factor productionprocess (i.e., low elasticities of substitution between labor and otherfactors of production). It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of theseproductivity and cost reducing effects. Any estimated economic costs ofcompliance would have to be adjusted downward to reflect these effects.Since data were not available to make any offset estimates, the economiceffects of the standard identified in this chapter are overstated. In addition, OSHA is allowing a phase-in period, up to five years, forengineering controls. Respirator use will be allowed during this period.Economic costs presented in this chapter will be overstated to the extentthat capital expenditures are delayed during the phase-in period. For this analysis, OSHA used a percentage reduction in profits approachto obtain estimates of the short-run economic impacts under the assumptionof perfect demand elasticity. These estimates were obtained by using thefollowing formula:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,aw,i1,22,25</C> <H1>Percentage Reduction = </H1><H1>New Profits^Old Profits</H1><H2>Old Profits </H2><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">where: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">New Profits = (Old Pre-tax Profits_Compliance Costs) andmultiply; (1^TaxRate), and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Old Profits = (Return on Sales)*(Total Sales). </ITAG>These calculations were performed at the two-digit SIC level for firmsin large and small size-class stratifications (above and below 20 employees).The data used to obtain these estimates was based on Dun and Bradstreetcompany files [1;2]. The potential impact on prices was used to estimate the market consequencesunder the second assumption of inelastic demand. Total sales values for1985 were used, the year for which the compliance costs were estimated.(Total sales represent the totality of production that leaves the establishment,whether it is sold to customers or sent to a parent company in a captivetransaction. For industries in the service and trade sectors, total salesdata were also used. The rate of return percentage for each industry sectorcorrected and transformed gross sales data into more accurate and relevantindustry profit estimates.) For a given firm-size class, the potential price increase was estimatedby dividing the total estimated compliance costs for a firm by the salesof that firm. These estimated price effects were then compared to recentindustry price series. The intent of this comparison was to evaluate theimpact of the compliance cost-generated price increase in light of recentindustry price increase experience. In this scenario, the potential for international trade implications ofthe standard was explored. It is anticipated that any international tradeeffects will not be significant given the small value of domestically producedgoods and services which are exported (about seven percent of GDP). Also,the U.S. dollar has recently experienced a sharp decline in value relativeto the yen and European Currencies. Between February 1985 and December1987, the trade-weighted value of the U.S. dollar fell 46 percent [3].This depreciation will likely overwhelm any potential adverse internationaleconomic effect of the standard. In Tables H-1 and H-2, the estimated domestic economic impacts are reportedfor the two polar methodologies. To derive the percentage change in profitsand the costs as a percent of sales, industry sales and rate of return(R.o.R) on sales data were obtained from Dun and Bradstreet. The totalsales data are the best estimates for industry sectors potentially impactedby the rule.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">insert illustration(s) 01911-1912 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG>Dun and Bradstreet provided OSHA with this information. The R.o.R. on saleswere obtained from summary statistics found in the Dun and Bradstreet IndustryNorms Database. <T3>Industry Effects. </T3>The estimated economic impact of the rule forfirms potentially affected is summarized in Table H-1. These estimatesrepresent the maximum industry impact within a market scenario where noneof the costs can be passed onto consumers, and there is no productivityoffset to costs. Data in Table H-1 indicate that the rule will not have a significant impacton profits in most industry sectors. The estimated average change in profitsis less than one percent; this amount of profit reduction should not representa significant economic burden. The most adversely affected industry sector is SIC 30, Rubber and Plastics,with an estimated 2.3 percent reduction in profits. The only other industrywith an impact greater than 2 percent is SIC 24, Lumber and Wood (2.2 percent).However, even in the worst case, OSHA believes the standard is economicallyfeasible. In reality, the reduction in profits will be less because partof the costs will be passed on to consumers, and because profitabilityin these industries since 1985 (the year for which the cost impact wasestimated) has improved [9]. Consumer effects were estimated using a ``full cost passthrough'' scenario.As demonstrated by the estimates summarized in Table H-2, the impacts onmarket prices will not be significant. No price increase would exceed one-halfof one percent. Changes of this magnitude are within general price movementsrecorded by producer price and other price indices.During the public hearing and comment period OSHA received comments concerningthe economic impact of the standard. Comments were primarily concernedwith the following industries and substances. <T3>SIC 20: </T3>The meat packing and processing industries (SICs 2011and 2013) expressed concern over the impact a carbon disulfide PEL of 1ppm would have on the cellulosic casings industry (SIC 3079). Industryrepresentatives in all three of these SICs believe that if OSHA sets aPEL which is economically difficult to meet, domestic production of themeat casings will dramatically decrease [Ex. 3-659; 3-756; 3-757; 3-898]*<NOTE/>. Although foreign markets already supply casings to the U.S.meat industry, this industry believes that foreign markets will not beable to absorb a dramatic change in demand for casings [Ex. 3-898; 3-897;3-756]. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>* All Exhibit [Ex.] numbers refer to the material in DocketH-020, the official record of this rulemaking. References to the transcriptsof the public hearings, available in the docket, are identified as ``Tr.''followed by the date of the hearing and the page numbers of the transcript.OSHA has decided to increase the PEL for carbon disulfide from the proposedlimit of 1 ppm to a standard of 4 ppm. Compliance with a 4 ppm PEL willbe easier for casing manufacturers. OSHA believes that domestic productionwill be unaffected by a carbon disulfide PEL of 4 ppm, particularly sincerespirators may be used in difficult to control operations.<T3>SIC 23: </T3>See SIC 72.<T3>SICs 24 and 25:</T3> The wood and furniture industries argued thatto comply with the proposed PEL of 5 mg/m3 for softwood and 1 mg/m3 forhardwood, the majority of establishments will have to engineer to 1 mg/m3for all wood dust since most establishments process both soft and hardwood. Most commenters concluded that they, as well as most members of theirindustry, would go out of business if they had to control wood dust exposuresto 1 mg/m3.Several industry organizations submitted comments and information concerningthe potential economic impact of these PELs on their industry [Ex. 3-626;3-627; 3-748; 3-899; 3-951; 3-627]. The U.S. Small Business Administration(SBA) believes ``it is likely that the wood dust PELs of 1 mg/m3 for hardwood dust and 5 mg/m3 for soft wood dust are not economically feasiblefor small facilities with fewer than 20 employees,'' and that a ``5 mg/m3standard . . . may be more economically feasible for affected industries''[Ex. 3-951]. This recommendation was supported by many comments from industry[Ex. 3-627; 3-768; 3-750; 3-917].OSHA's final rule establishes a 5 mg/m3 PEL for all wood dust except Westernred cedar, for which a 2.5 mg/m3 limit is established. OSHA believes thatthe 2.5 mg/m3 standard for this allergenic wood is feasible since 90% ofthe firms using Western red cedar are located in the state of Washingtonwhich has already adopted a 2.5 mg/m3 PEL.OSHA's estimated costs for compliance with the final PELs are significantlylower than those corresponding to the proposed PELs of 1 and 5 mg/m3. Theeconomic impact of the standard on these wood processing industries reflectsthis decrease in cost. These reduced costs amount to 2% of profits. (Theactual effects on profits will be even less since some costs will be passedon to consumers.)Industries in SIC 24 had strong domestic and foreign markets in 1987. Priceincreases averaged 5% over 1986. As a result of increasing prices, demand,and output, profits increased for firms in this industry. The 1988 U.S.Industrial Outlook predicted a 41% growth (in constant dollars) of shipmentsof wood products in 1988. These recent developments indicate that the economicimpact of complying with a 5 mg/m3 PEL for wood dust will be less thanthe impact presented in Table H-1 [9].In addition, furniture product shipments in SIC 251 increased 4.5% in 1987(constant dollars) [9]. This will make it easier for firms in this SICto absorb the costs imposed by this rule, and the economic impact willactually be less than that estimated by OSHA.<T3>SIC 30:</T3> Establishments in SIC 308 submitted comments and informationconcerning OSHA's proposed standard of 50 ppm for styrene. The StyreneInformation Research Council (SIRC) submitted cost and impact estimatesof the proposed PEL on SIC 30 and SIC 37 [Ex. 3-742]. OSHA has examinedthis information and, based on reasons outlined in the cost chapter ofthis document (Chpt. G), has determined that the survey performed for thisrulemaking provides the most accurate and up-to-date information on employeeexposures and cost of controls. The costs OSHA estimates are less than.44% of profits and are economically feasible. In addition, the value ofshipments of rubber and plastics products have been increasing since 1985(for which costs and impacts were estimated), and growth in shipments isprojected to be 2% in 1988 [9]. Increased profitability should offset theeconomic consequences of compliance.Comments were received from the manufacturers of cellulosic casings (SIC3079) concerning OSHA's proposed PEL of 1 ppm for carbon disulfide. Thereare three companies which currently produce these casings. A study of engineeringcontrols required to comply with this PEL, as well as the costs of thesecontrols, was submitted by industry [Ex. 8-45]. This study indicated highcosts to control to 1 ppm. OSHA has subsequently adopted a 4 ppm PEL forthe final rule. OSHA concludes that industry can comply with this level.(According to docket evidence, at least one company already operates at10 ppm or less [Ex. 3-945].) The costs are clearly feasible.<T3>SIC 33:</T3> Representatives of the American Iron and Steel Instituteindicated in their comments that because of the ``fragile financial condition''of the industry, capital investment for equipment such as engineering controlshas been limited [Ex. 72, pg. 32]. Representatives expressed concern overthe costs to comply with proposed OSHA PELs for several different substancesand the economic impact on competition with foreign steel producers [Ex.72, pg. 3, and pp. 33-34]. Although the dollar has recently depreciatedin value relative to the yen and European currencies, depreciation of thedollar relative to the value of currencies of steel-producing countrieshas been gradual [9]. It is likely that the dollar's depreciation willnot be as beneficial to the steel industry as it will for other industries.However, exports of steel-intensive products (excluding motor vehicles)has increased due to the dollar's depreciation (by June of 1987, the volumeof exports was 24% over the 1986 level) [9]. Although the steel industryis not growing rapidly, it is certainly not experiencing the downturn ofthe early 1980's, and the impact of compliance costs should not be as detrimentalas the industry predicted [Ex. 72].In addition, the PELs for iron oxide and aluminum metal dust, two substanceswhich constituted a significant part of the costs estimated for this industryin the 1987 proposal, will not be changed from the OSHA standard currentlyin effect. OSHA recognizes the special feasibility problems of complyingwith the proposed PELs for hazardous substance exposures in the steel industry,and is allowing the use of respirators in operations where carbon monoxideand sodium dioxide are present. These changes will substantially decreasecosts to the industry, and hence will lessen the economic impact.<T3>SIC 37:</T3> Styrene exposures in the manual layup/sprayup operationsin the boat building industry are difficult to control through engineeringmethods due to the nature of the operation and small space within whichthe styrene is applied [Ex. 3-742]. Evidence submitted to the docket suggeststypical exposures in this industry are below 50 ppm except in the layup/sprayupoperation [Ex. 3-742]. OSHA is permitting respirator use in these operationsin this industry in view of special compliance problems. The costs arelow (.24%) in relation to profits. OSHA concludes there will be no adverseeconomic impact on the industry.<T3>SIC 51:</T3> Concern was expressed by the National Grain and Feed Association(NGFA) on behalf of the grain elevator operators/grain handlers in SIC5153 and the National Cotton Council regarding the feasibility of the proposedPEL of 4 mg/m3 for grain dust [Ex. 3-752 and Ex. 3-1080]. For the finalrule, OSHA has established a PEL of 10 mg/m3. Most employee exposures areat or below 10 mg/m3, (see Chapt. G, pg. 19).OSHA's assessment of the economic impact of the proposal by two-digit SICwas criticized as being too general an approach for estimating the economicconsequences of the rule on industry subsectors [Ex. 3-752]. The economicimpact of the standard is based on the costs presented above in ChapterG. These costs are based on an industry survey conducted by OSHA for thisrulemaking which gathered data at the four digit level. However, the surveywas designed to be statistically meaningful at the cell level (two or threedigit SIC level). There would be more uncertainty at the four digit level.Much four digit data were in the record and OSHA developed more when requestedby participants. As discussed above, OSHA concludes that its cost estimatefor SIC 51 (which includes many grain elevators) is accurate. The costsdemonstrate economic feasibility even if all costs were borne by SIC 5153(grain elevators).<T3>SIC 72:</T3> In the proposed standard, OSHA indicated an intentionto change the PEL for perchloroethylene to 50 ppm. Employees are exposedto this chemical during a wet-to-dry industrial process used in the drycleaning, laundry, and garment sector (SIC 721). Comments received fromthe International Fabricare Institute indicated that by 1992, almost allmachines used by dry cleaners will be dry-to-dry, a process which has reducedexposures to perchloroethylene [Ex. 3-671]. OSHA believes that industrycan comply with a lower PEL of 25 ppm within the four year phase-in periodthrough the normal course of capital replacement as dry-to-dry processequipment is substituted for wet-to-dry process equipment.OSHA is sympathetic to the circumstances of the number of small businessesin this SIC. OSHA has stated in the Preamble discussion that a phase-inperiod, up to five years, will be allowed for engineering controls. Ifit appears that there will be a significant economic difficulty for smalldry cleaning operations to convert to new equipment or to retrofit withinthe time period permitted by the Standard, OSHA will consider extendingthe phase-in period for firms in this industry.<ITAG tagnum="81">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (P.L. 96-353, 94 Stat.1164 [5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.]), OSHA has assessed the impact of the rulemakingon large and small establishments. For this assessment, large establishmentsare defined as those with 20 or more employees and small establishmentsas those with 19 or fewer employees. The results of this assessment aresummarized in Table H-3.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) O 1921</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG>Industry sales and profit estimates were based on data from Dun and Bradstreetand the Department of Commerce 1982 Census of Manufactures [5], Wholesalers[6], Retailers [7] and Services [8]. Sales and profit data for selectedtransportation sector industries (SIC 40, 45, 47 and 49) were not availablefor use in this assessment. The information summarized in Table H-3 indicates that with three exceptionssmall firms will not have important adverse impacts. Data for small establishments in SIC 24 (Lumber and Wood), SIC 30 (Rubberand Plastics), and SIC 37 (Transportation Equipment Manufacturers), showthe potential for more significant changes in profits. In the case of SIC24, many small businessmen and their representatives testified and supportedthe final standard. This suggests that the impact will be manageable. It should be noted that these negative effects result in part from theextreme assumption of perfectly elastic demand. An important amelioratingfactor for each firm will be its ability to pass through additional coststo the consumer. The ability of individual firms to do this will be dependentupon product demand elasticities. It is expected that most impacted firmswill be able to pass through some portion of their increased costs.<ITAG tagnum="81">Environmental Impact Assessment </ITAG>This assessment has been prepared in accordance with provisions of theNational Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4325 et seq.) as wellas the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR Part1500), and DOL-NEPA Compliance Procedures (29 CFR Part 11).OSHA has reviewed the standard and the information contained in the secondarydata bases, as well, as the information submitted by the contractors' industryexperts and submissions by the public to the record during the course ofthis rulemaking, and has concluded that no significant environmental impactsare likely to occur as a result of this action. Two environments may be affected by an OSHA regulatory action: (1) Theworkplace environment; and (2) the general human environment external tothe workplace, including impacts on air and water pollution, solid waste,energy, and land use. Usually OSHA regulations have their most significantimpacts on the workplace environment since this environment is under theAgency's jurisdiction. Lower and new PELs will benefit the workplace environmentbecause they will reduce worker exposure to toxic substances. In most cases, the effects of previous OSHA regulations on the exterrnalenvironment have been negligible because of their limited scope and application.Similarly, there is no evidence to indicate that there would be any significantadverse impacts to the external environment as a result of this standard.As with other OSHA regulations in the past, however, there may be a potentialbenefit to the environment. The potential benefits and other impacts arebriefly summarized here. <T3>Air Pollution.</T3> Because of the nature of the emission standardsof the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR Part 61), many industryoperations already use engineering controls to reduce the amount of emissionsto the atmosphere. This practice is not expected to change as a resultof the rule. OSHA anticipates that controls already in place will continueto operate effectively in reducing emissions under the revised standard.Fourteen of the chemicals addressed in this standard have been recognizedby EPA as air pollutants. These are listed below:<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Beryllium</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Carbon Monoxide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Epichlorohydrin</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Ethylene dichloride</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Hexachlorocyclopentadiene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Mercury</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Methyl chloroform</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Nitrogen dioxide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Ozone</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Perchloroethylene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Sulfur dioxide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Toluene</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Trichloroethylene</ITAG><T3>Water Pollution. </T3>EPA regulates over 100 of the chemicals addressedin this standard under the Clean Water Act of 1977 (33 USC 1251 et seq.).EPA's effluent limitation guidelines (40 CFR Part 427) include (1) standardsof performance for all new point sources within specified categories and(2) pretreatment standards for new plants discharging to municipal sewersystems. These limitations would serve to prevent the discharge of effluentsinto the environment without prior treatment. Moreover, the Federal WaterPollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 required that wastewater effluentsbe treated by the best practicable technology (BPT) by December 31, 1977and that the best available technology (BAT) economically achievable beused by December 31, 1983. The EPA effluent limitations establish the degreeof effluent quality necessary to meet the BPT and BAT requirements. TheBAT and pretreatment standards would essentially mean no discharge of processwastewater to navigable waters and no discharge of incompatible pollutants.These requirements will not change as the result of this proposal and wherethey continue to be met, effluent quality will not be altered. <T3>Solid Waste Disposal. </T3>It does not appear that there would be anysignificant change in present waste disposal practices for over 80 chemicalsaddressed by this rule, or in the maintenance of waste disposal sites.EPA's national emissions standards will continue to provide for the controland maintenance of active and inactive disposal sites and require no visibleemissions from these sites. <T3>Energy And Land Use. </T3>The implementation of required engineeringcontrols could result in an increase in total energy requirements or costsfor general industry. This would be particularly true where controls arenot in place. Where general exhaust ventilation is used, there is the expenseof heating or cooling the replacement air brought in from the outside.These costs, plus the cost of vacuuming, where necessary, have been includedin the annual costs estimated in Chapter G. In terms of land use, OSHAdoes not project any significant impact on land use plans, policies orcontrols. OSHA does not anticipate any significant impact on the shortterm uses of man's environment or upon the maintenance of long-term productivity.<T3>Other Impacts. </T3>The standard could also have other impacts thatmay affect the external environment. The standard could encourage the furtheruse, research, and development of suitable substitutes for hazardous chemicals.This, in turn, would result in a positive environmental effect becausefewer hazardous chemicals would be used, emitted to the air, dischargedas wastewater effluent, or disposed of as solid waste. The magnitude orprobability of these impacts, however, is impossible to quantify. Overall, the projected impacts of the standard on the external environmentare not expected to be significant in view of EPA's regulation of air emissions,water effluents, and solid waste disposal methods. <ITAG tagnum="81">Summary </ITAG>Based on the data summarized in Tables H-1 and H-2 and historical information,and information submitted by the public during this rulemaking procedure,OSHA has concluded that the economic impacts of the standard are clearlyfeasible for industry sectors and subsectors. However, the estimates indicatethat some small establishments in SICs 24, 30, and 37 may experience agreater impact than larger entities. The rule is not expected to have anadverse effect on the environment. <ITAG tagnum="73">References </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. Industry Norms and Key Business Ratios.1985.

Survey Objectives Surveys are frequently designed to produce a set of estimates at a predefinedlevel of accuracy. This requires defining the set of quantities to be estimatedand specifying their levels of accuracy. Since many variables may ultimatelybe estimated from the survey, and since no single design can be optimalfor all estimates simultaneously, it is customary to define the most importantvariables for estimation. For this survey, the following variables wereidentified as those motivating the survey design:<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Cost to industry of the proposed set of new permissible exposurelimits (as a group); </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Number of workers potentially exposed to toxic substances;and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Number of workers affected by the proposed regulations.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Statistical theory dictates that responses be concentrated both ingroups which have the highest variability with respect to these variablesand in groups representing the majority of establishments in the population.No hard information relating to the variability of the variables mentionedabove by industry sector or other relevant breakdown was available at theoutset of the survey. Hence, the variability in the number of employeeswas used as a variability measure. Consistent with the notion that thevariability of numbers exposed as well as the variability of cost requiredto remedy an overexposure are highest in the largest companies, the samplewas designed to include a higher proportion of larger establishments. The sample was drawn so as to insure that the relative standard errors(RSE) estimates (the ratio of the sample standard error to the mean) waswithin predetermined bounds. The relative standard error is a measure ofthe accuracy of each estimate. A relative standard error of 5 percent meansthat the standard error of the estimate is equal to 5 percent of that estimate.This can be interpreted as saying that the estimate is within two standarderrors or 10 percent of the true value with 95 percent probability. Sincerisks were judged to be different in different sectors, OSHA selected a5 percent relative standard error in the industries using the most chemicals,7.5 percent in industries with moderate use of chemicals and 10 percentin the service sectors. A table of design specifications is included inSection A.5 below. 3. Sampling Frame Selection The Dun and Bradstreet (Dandamp;B) listing was chosen for the PEL surveysampling frame (a listing of establishments from which sample units areselected). This is a nationally based list, containing establishment namesas well as each establishment's address, telephone number, SIC code, andnumber of employees. The Dun and Bradstreet database is regularly refined(every six months) thus minimizing the probability of obtaining out ofbusiness or out of scope (e.g., wrong SIC code) establishments when usingthe frame. The Dandamp;B is a commercial listing and its use does not violateany confidentiality requirement associated with other frames availableto particular agencies in the government. 4. Stratification Thirty-four groupings of industries (estimation cells) were chosen to beexamined for the PEL study. The cell definitions were determined by groupingtogether industry sectors defined by Standard Industrial Classifications(SICs) which share similar processes and procedures. The cell definitionsused for the PEL survey are given in TABLE 1-1.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 003 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) O 1931-1933 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For each estimation cell, units on the Dun and Bradstreet samplingframe were classified into one of the four size classes listed below: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p8,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s10,xs62 </C> <H1> </H1><H1>Number of employees</H1> Size: <ITAG tagnum="2">1 <D>1 to 19. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">2 <D>20 to 99. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">3 <D>100 to 249. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">4 <D>250 and above.</D></ITAG></ITAG> For each size class stratum within a cell, the establishments on the framewere further identified by their four digit SIC classification (withinthe two or three digit sample cell). A separate systematic sample was thenselected in each estimation cell/size class stratum. This procedure wasaccomplished by first selecting one case at random in the size class fromthe first K units on the frame_where K is the reciprocal of the samplingfraction_and then selecting every Kth unit in the stratum thereafter. Note,from the size class definitions that establishments having zero employeeswere not included in this survey. Such units were assumed to be out ofthe scope of the survey. 5. Sample Size Determination and Allocation Within Strata The total number of establishments selected from the Dun and Bradstreetsampling frame was determined using two stages. The first stage was tocompute the target number of respondents for each estimation cell usingthe standard sample size formula. The required specifying a target relativestandard error (RSE) for the cell estimates. The RSE's for this surveywere set at the following levels: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp8,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s10,4 </C><T3>Relative standard error (percent) </T3><H1>  </H1><H1> </H1> SIC range: <ITAG tagnum="1">24 through 29 <D>5.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">30 through 39 <D>7.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">40 through 80 <D>10.0</D></ITAG></ITAG> The units were then allocated to size classes within the estimation cellsusing Neyman allocation. This method allocates based on the number of establishmentsin each stratum and on the stratum variability in the key design variable(in this case employment). Size class strata having a large number of establishmentson the frame or a high variability in employment (as defined by the populationvariance) received a greater number of sample units than other strata inthe sample. Because the larger size classes often have a high variabilityin employment, this allocation resulted in ``oversampling'' the largersize classes in a cell. The required number of cases for each stratum areshown in TABLE 1-2 in the column labeled ``Target Number of Respondents.''<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M 005 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 0 1936-1940 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C  </ITAG>The number of units actually selected from the Dandamp;B frame in each stratumwas based on the number of completed cases required for the stratum andon the expected response rate. Almost all sample surveys, especially voluntarysurveys, select some number of cases which do not result in a completedinterview. In some instances, these will be establishments which have goneout of business, are duplicate cases, or are companies not in the SIC categoryshown on the frame. Such cases are ``Out of Scope.'' Other establishments,though in scope, refuse to participate or are not reached in the samplingprotocol, defined here as a total of five telephone attempts. Experienceon surveys similar to the PEL survey indicated that a completion ratioof 50-60% was expected for this survey (the ratio of completed questionnairesto total cases which must be drawn_both in and out of scope). However,to be safe, a larger number of cases were selected and held in reservefrom the Dandamp;B frame so that, if additional sample units needed to beincluded to reach the target sample sizes, the cases could be easily obtained.In fact, for the vast majority of cells, a 60 percent completion ratiowas realized. The total number of establishments called in each of thesample strata are shown in TABLE 1-2 in the column labeled ``Total CasesCalled.'' In general, this number is equal to the target sample dividedby 0.60. The number of completed survey responses is shown in TABLE 1-2.6. Data Collection Methodology The data collection method chosen for the survey was Computer AssistedTelephone Interviewing (CATI). In this method the interviewer talks tothe respondent on the telephone while sitting in front of a computer screen.Each question to be asked appears on the screen in the proper sequence.CATI systems allow for the responses to be examined during the data collectionprocess. Answers that are out of the possible range of responses or whichare not consistent with other answers received earlier in the questionnairecan be immediately identified. Another advantage is that it frees the interviewerfrom using a hard copy questionnaire which requires skipping manually todifferent parts of the questionnaire based upon the responses. Finally,this method saves resources by creating a machine readable record of theresponses at the conclusion of the interview, thereby eliminating the needfor keypunching. 7. Establishment Count Comparison Comparison of the survey establishment count is designed to put into reliefboth consistencies and inconsistencies between the sample results comparedwith other existing databases. Table II-4 of the RIA compares the estimatednumber of establishments from the sample survey with the Dun and Bradstreet(Dandamp;B) establishment list (the sample frame), the establishment countfrom County Business Patterns (CBP) and the establishment count from theBureau of Labor Statistics ES-202 file. In general, the survey producedestablishment estimates in between the higher Dandamp;B counts and the lowerCBP and ES-202 establishment numbers.8. Variance Estimation As with any sample survey, quantification of sampling error of estimatesis an important function. Errors are quantified by computing the standarderror of each estimate produced from the survey. Under certain assumptions,the standard error can be used to make probability statements about estimates.For example, an interval approximately equal to two standard errors oneither side of an estimate is a 95 percent confidence interval. Such aninterval indicates the expected range into which the estimate would fall95 percent of the time, were the survey to be replicated many times. A replication technique was used to determine standard errors for the PELsurvey. Such techniques involve resampling the sample data multiple timesto calculate its variability. A replication method was chosen because oftwo characteristics of the survey. First, some of the estimates which wereplanned to be produced are nonlinear, such as the benchmarked estimatesdescribed above. Second, nonresponse adjustment was used to modify thefinal weights. In both of these situations, replication-type variance estimatorsare particularly useful.The PEL survey was designed using employment as a variability measure.The survey results are consistent with this design; those estimates moreclosely related to employment had lower relative standard errors. Hence,the RSE for the survey estimate for the total number of production workersover all industries was three percent, for the total number of workerspotentially exposed, four percent overall, and for the total number ofworkers overexposed, six percent overall. Compared to these estimates, the final cost estimates had considerablyhigher RSE's. This stems from the fact that many establishments were assigneda zero cost, while others in the same stratum were often assigned a verylarge cost. This ``all or none'' characteristic of the costing algorithmresulted in an increased RSE for this variable. Even so, for all industriescombined, the overall RSE for cost was 11 percent.9. Treatment of Non-Sampling Errors An important component to any survey effort is the treatment of nonsamplingerrors. Examples of such errors are: andbullet; Nonresponse bias_error introduced because some selected respondentseither do not respond at all (unit nonresponse) or do not respond to aparticular question (item nonresponse); andbullet; Response bias_error introduced due to the way questions are phrasedor the way respondents interpret what is being asked (this also includeserror due to deliberate misrepresentation of the answers to questions byrespondents). In the PEL survey, the nonresponse problem was dealt with using two standardmethodologies. For unit nonresponse, a mean imputation procedure was used.This procedure assumes that there is no fundamental difference betweenrespondents and nonrespondents and, therefore, usable cases can be reweightedto represent the entire universe. For item nonresponse, an imputation schemewhich uses related cases in the respondent group to estimate the missingdata was used. The situation for response bias was handled by obtaining information fromsite visits. OSHA conducted 90 site visits in a cross section of industries.A portion of these visits were performed on establishments which were alsoin the telephone survey. Data on key variables collected during the telephonesurvey were compared with information obtained from the site visits. Thisanalysis can be found in Supplement 3.<ITAG tagnum="81">9.1. Unit nonresponse adjustment </ITAG>To adjust the sample for those cases selected from the Dandamp;B frame whichwhere called but were out of scope (OOS), out of business (OOB), or inscope but unwilling to participate in the survey, the following approachwas used. andbullet; All solicited sample units were assigned a response code basedon the following categories:Code and Description <ITAG tagnum="15">03 Non-working telephone number </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">04 Incorrect SIC_out of scope </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">05 Out of Business (OOB) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">06 Not a business or wrong business </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">07 Duplicate record </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">08 Could not reach respondent after five attempts </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">09 Communication barrier </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">10 Initial refusal </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">11 Mid-interview refusal (did not answer initial chemical and processquestions) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">12 Completed interview (completed both initial chemical and processquestions) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">13 Other nonresponse. </ITAG>andbullet; All units having a response code equal to 08, 09, 10, 11, 12,or 13 were classified as viable sample units (in scope, in business). Sampleunits having a response code equal to 12 were classified as both viableand usable. A nonresponse adjustment weight was assigned to each usablerecord in the database, based on the ratio of viable to usable sample unitsin the record's cell and size stratum:<G/><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus 0 1946A</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"/><ITAG tagnum="20">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">i=number of estimation cell</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">j=number of the size class</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">I(V<T2>k</T2>)=l if the kth sample unit is viable,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">   =O otherwise;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">I(U<T2>k</T2>)=l if the kth sample unit is usable,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">   =O otherwise.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The use of this weight is equivalent to performing a mean imputationfor item nonresponse. The response rate may be defined as the number of usable cases dividedby the number of viables, and the completion rate as the number of usablesdivided by the total number of cases contacted. Using these definitions,the response and completion rates were as follows:<ITAG tagnum="26">Response rate=68.7%</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Completion rate=60.0%</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">9.2. Item nonresponse adjustment/imputation </ITAG>Often survey respondents do not know the answers to some questions or refuseto answer particular questions. In such cases, it is possible to fill inmissing values using an imputation scheme. The idea is to use informationfrom both the respondent (answers to other questions which they did supply)and information from other respondents (those answering the missing question)in order to estimate a reasonable response to the missing datum. The imputation method chosen for the PEL survey is a hybrid method whichcombines the concepts of a mean imputation and a ``hot-deck'' imputation.A mean imputation method replaces the missing values on a certain questionwith the mean value from those respondents answering that question. A hotdeck method attempts to find a respondent who matches the respondent havinga missing value (in terms of other survey characteristics) and uses thevalue of the ``twin'' to replace the missing value. The method used hereis a hybrid in the sense that it employs a mean imputation, but only overa small segment of the population which obviously matches the respondenthaving a missing value. In particular, the procedure examines three or four digit SIC subgroupswithin the estimation cell by size class. The mean values of the responsesto a particular question of interest in such sample subgroupings were usedto impute the missing values in that grouping. In the case of categoricalvariables (for example, YES/NO questions), a randomization scheme was usedrandomly supplied the appropriate set of responses to missing questionsbased on a probability distribution determined from those who responded.It should be noted that the values which were placed on the database werenot intended to be estimates of the missing responses. Rather, they aremeant to be substitute responses which allow the case to be used in thegeneration of survey estimates. In the aggregate, estimates produced usingimputed data make sense for use in aggregate estimates, but may not beuseful for the individual establishment. Care was taken in the imputationprogram to be sure that imputed responses were consistent with other answersfor the establishment of interest. Original responses to all questionswere retained on the sample record and all responses representing imputedvalues were identified.One set of questions which was not imputed for was whether monitoring forthe presence of certain toxic chemicals was done at the establishment.The data collected produced an estimate, for those establishments wherechemicals or processes were found, that 15.8 percent did monitoring, 71.9percent did not do monitoring, and 12.3 percent of respondents did notknow or refused to answer the question. Of those establishments that didmonitor, 25.6 percent provided the requested data.10. Survey InstrumentAs mentioned earlier, data collection for PEL survey was accomplished byComputer Assisted Telephone Interviewing. Prior to calling, a letter wassent to each selected establishment. This letter is shown in Exhibit 1-1.Also, a hard copy version of the PEL questionnaire is given in Exhibit1-2.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M012</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 1949-1960</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLIING CODE 4510-26-C </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Summary and Explanation of the Standard</ITAG>A. Scope and Selection of PELsOn the basis of all evidence, OSHA has concluded that the TLVs publishedby the ACGIH constitute the best available starting point for determiningthe substances included in this Rulemaking. Thus, the boundaries of thesubstances to be considered in this standard were established to includeall of the substances included in the   1987-88 ACGIH TLV listing. Therewas widespread support for OSHA's selection of these substances for regulationwhich increased the Agency's confidence that the substances selected forthis generic rulemaking are both necessary and appropriate. See also thediscussion in Section I.D. of the Proposal and IV. D. of this preamble.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) additionally recommended as a potential source the NordicExpert Group for Documentation of Occupational Exposure Limits. NIOSH stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">No single source should be expected to stand alone as a comprehensivelist of candidates for regulation. OSHA should construct its own comprehensivelist by drawing information from all available sources (Ex. 8-47, p. 20).</ITAG>OSHA agrees with NIOSH in general, although it determined that it was necessaryto select a single, comprehensive list as the starting point for considerationfor regulation.As described in the Proposal, the Agency used both the NIOSH RELs and ACGIHTLVs as starting points for establishing PEL's, and then carefully reviewedall of the literature, comments and testimony submitted in the course ofthis rulemaking. After careful review and evaluation of this body of informationon any given substance and in conformance with Agency policy and statutoryrequirements, OSHA then determined the appropriate PEL or PELs for eachsubstance.U.V. Henderson, Jr., Director of Environmental Affairs for the Texaco Company,endorsed OSHA's choice of regulatory candidates by stating: ``No substancesare included in the listings which should be excluded from the rulemaking''(Ex. 3-593). In this regard, NIOSH also expressed support for the inclusionof the proposed substances but urged OSHA to take further action ``immediatelyupon completion of this rulemaking . . . to establish PELs for all substancesthat are excluded from this rulemaking'' and for which NIOSH has made arecommendation to OSHA (Ex. 8-47, p. 19). NIOSH stated that OSHA shouldinitiate ``consolidated rulemaking . . . to adopt all NIOSH RELs pending(the initiation of) chemical-specific Section 6(b) rulemaking . . .'' (Ex.8-47, p. 17). In the future OSHA will review those RELs for which thereare not PELs. Based on that analysis, other priorities and resources, OSHAwill determine the need to develop PELs for these substances.For its discussion of health effects, OSHA grouped substances on the basisof the TLV documentation. The substances were divided into fifteen generichealth effects groups. These were: neuropathic effects, narcotic effects,sensory irritants, liver and kidney effects, ocular effects, adverse respiratoryeffects, cardiovascular effects, systemic effects, no observed effects,physical irritants and other effects, odor and taste effects, analogy,biochemical and metabolic effects, sensitizers, and carcinogenic effects.The OSHA analysis also considered three special categories concerned with:change only to the STEL; change regarding skin designation in the TLV;and situations where the TLV is greater than the existing PEL.OSHA is establishing these new limits for general industry only at thistime. In the future, consideration will be given to applying these limitsto construction, maritime and agriculture. To attempt to consider thesesectors in this rulemaking would have delayed this important process. Seealso the discussion in Section IV. F. of this Preamble.B. Start-Up ScheduleOSHA intends that the effective date of the new exposure limits shall beMarch 1, 1989, in conformance with provisions set forth in Section 6(b)(4)of the OSH Act.In addition, OSHA has set forth start-up dates for most of its health standardsacknowledging that it takes time for employers to evaluate exposures aswell as to purchase, install and make operable equipment to control suchexposures.In the case of this standard, OSHA has considered the need for start-updates to allow sufficient time to take into account the fact that manyemployers will have to evaluate and make operable controls for severaldifferent chemicals. This will undoubtedly require more time than wouldbe necessary for only one chemical.OSHA believes that September 1, 1989, is a reasonable time by which toevaluate exposures and come into compliance with any reasonable combinationof engineering, work practice and respirator control methods. OSHA standardsgenerally have had a period of approximately this length or shorter tocome into compliance with an exposure limit with any reasonable combinationof controls. See for example, the benzene standard, 29 CFR 1910.1028 (m)(2),52 FR 34460, 345676 (September 11, 1987) and the formaldehyde standard,29 CFR 1910.1048 (p)(2)(iv), 52 FR 46168, 46296 (December 4, 1987). OSHAexperience has indicated that the six-month period following the effectivedate is appropriate and sufficient to come into compliance with any reasonablecombination of controls.The proposed rule (53 FR 20960 et seq.) suggested six months from the publicationdate of the final regulation as a reasonable time for employers to evaluatethe exposures of their employees and to come into compliance using anycombination of respirators, work practices and engineering controls. Severalcommenters, such as the Texaco Company (Ex. 3-593) and the Synthetic OrganicChemical Manufacturers Association (SOCMA) (Ex. 3-891), indicated thatsuch an approach was appropriate. The Kerr McGee Corporation (Ex. 3-623)was more specific in its comments and contended that the initial  6-monthperiod should be extended to a 24-month period to allow industry sufficienttime to monitor and develop the necessary control measures. The AmericanPaper Institute (Ex. 3-685) was also of the opinion that an initial 6-monthcompliance period would be too short. OSHA believes that the September1, 1989, date is adequate based on all of the comments received and OSHA'spast experience.OSHA has generally provided a more extended period to come into complianceusing the hierarchy of controls contained in 29 CFR 1910.1000 (e), withits preference for engineering and work practice controls. It takes moretime, in general, to plan, purchase equipment, install and make operationalengineering controls than to implement other types of control strategies.Examples of representative start-up periods include: 1 to 10 years (dependingupon the sector) for the lead standard, 29 CFR 1910.1025 (e); 4 years forthe cotton dust standard, 29 CFR 1910.1043 (m); 2 years for the benzenestandard, 29 CFR 1910.1028 (m)(2)(ii); and 14 months for the formaldehydestandard, 29 CFR 1910.1048 (p)(2)(v). These dates have varied dependingupon OSHA estimates of the difficulties involved. OSHA's experience hasbeen that generally the times for these standards have been sufficient.In the Proposal, OSHA also estimated that all employers, including thosewho would have to control exposures for several different chemicals, couldachieve compliance within four years using the hierarchy of controls specifiedin 29 CFR 1910.1000 (e) (i.e., engineering controls, work practices, andif these are not feasible, personal protective equipment). Regarding thefour-year engineering controls implementation date schedule, OSHA receiveda number of comments. Generally industry supported the four-year period.NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) suggested that two years was a reasonable time for compliance,and a number of unions supported that period. The Fibre Box Association,however, recommended ten years (Ex. 3-823).In testimony July 15, 1988, related to the experience of the WashingtonState Occupational Safety and Health Administration with respect to updatingpermissible exposure limits, Stephen M. Cant stated (Ex. 20):<ITAG tagnum="21">Washington's PELs became effective thirty days after adoption anddid not include a lengthy phase-in for engineering controls. No protests,no complaints, and no observable difficulties have been encountered; however,use of good judgment is always critical to successful enforcement. Engineeringcontrols are not always feasible, although significant improvement, ifnot total control, is often obtained. In practical terms, longer interimtimes between implementation and full engineering control tends to occurwith lowered PELs and in some cases respirators provide the only controlor are used in combination with engineering.</ITAG>OSHA has evaluated the data from various industries regarding the timeneeded to come into compliance with the hierarchy of controls set forthin 1910.1000 (e), and has determined that it is feasible for employersin nearly all operations to achieve compliance using engineering controlsby December 31, 1992. OSHA's experience is that for substances of normaldifficulty, one to two years is sufficient. The longer approximately four-yearperiod takes into account that some employers will have to control severalsubstances and also considers those few substances where compliance maytake greater efforts for some employers. Because of the large number ofemployers and types of industry OSHA covers, OSHA does not believe a veryshort period similar to that used by the State of Washington would be feasible.For a very small number of specific operations (involving 4 substances_carbonmonoxide, carbon disulfide, sulfur dioxide and styrene_which are discussedin this preamble in Section VII.), OSHA has indicated that employers mayuse any combination of controls and that the burden of proof that the finalrule's limits can be achieved in these designated operations using engineeringcontrols will rest with the Secretary of Labor, rather than the employer.Since OSHA is in the process of reviewing regulations relating to the hierarchyof controls, it asked in the Proposal whether the phase-in period shouldbe based on the final decisions in that rulemaking. Most of those who commentedsupported fixed dates. The Dow Chemical Company (Ex. 3-741) urged the Agencynot to wait to set a start-up date for this rule. A few companies (Exs.3-669 and 3-527) suggested that the Agency delay the coming-into-complianceperiod until after publication of any new regulations on this subject;these commenters cited costs of compliance as a major concern.OSHA concludes that fixed compliance dates are, in general, more appropriate.The times set are reasonable. The additional protection for many workersis a very important goal. Only a small number of participants supportedthe alternate approach. However, OSHA is setting forth the possibilityof a one-year extension as discussed below.OSHA did not raise the issue of methods of compliance in this rulemaking.The exposure limits required after the Transitional Period, are to be achievedwith the then current hierarchy of controls set forth in 29 CFR 1910.1000(e).In a separate Rulemaking OSHA will be requesting public comment on methodsof compliance shortly. The results of that review may lead to change orno change in the OSHA hierarchy of controls as set forth in 29 CFR 1910.1000(e).As discussed, OSHA has concluded that 4 years is a reasonable period forcoming into compliance with the new exposure limit through the methodsof compliance set forth in 29 CFR 1910.1000 (e) with its preference forengineering and work practice controls. If, however, the rulemaking onmethods of compliance has not been completed and published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> by December 31, 1991, either with a determinationto modify or not to modify, then some added flexibility is appropriate.Accordingly para. 1910.1000 (f)(2)(ii) provides that if the methods ofcompliance rulemaking is completed by December 31, 1991, then compliancewith paragraph (e) to lower exposures to the new limits is to be achievedby December 31, 1992. If, however, the methods of compliance rulemakingis not completed by December 31, 1991, then compliance with paragraph (e)to the new limits is to be achieved by December 31, 1993.OSHA proposed that in the Transitional Period, the existing exposure limitsare to be achieved with the hierarchy of controls specified in 1910.1000(e). That has been the requirement since 1971. Participants did not objectto this provision. OSHA is maintaining this provision in the final standard.Between September 1, 1989, and December 31, 1992, the existing limits fromTables Z-1 (which have been placed in the Transitional Limits Columns ofTable Z-1-A), Z-2, and Z-3 are to be achieved by the hierarchy of controlsspecified in 1910.1000 (e). This is a protective approach and no evidencehas been presented to contradict it.C. Analytical MethodsIn the proposal, OSHA included an appendix of analytic methods. It requestedcomments on those methods and on other methods, OSHA identified seven substancesfor which it was not aware of acceptable analytical methods. OSHA requestedcomments on how it should handle substances with no analytical method.It suggested that one approach was to issue a new limit but stay enforcementuntil a new method was developed. OSHA received few comments on the methods it proposed, alternate methods,or the approach to be followed for those few substances where OSHA wasnot aware of a practical method. Both NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) and the Los AlamosNational Laboratory (Ex. 3-741) expressed concern about promulgating limitsfor substances without existing or adequate sampling and analytical methods,i.e., substances requiring special attention because of the lack or inadequacyof methods to measure them in airborne concentrations (53 Fr 20978). Forthe substances identified by OSHA as lacking an available method, Los Alamosrepresentatives stated that rulemaking ``should be delayed until adequateand validated procedures are developed'' (Ex. 3-1095). NIOSH agreed withOSHA that substances without existing or adequate sampling and analyticalmethods should receive special attention (Ex. 8-47). According to NIOSH,``it is important that NIOSH and OSHA work together on a method developmentscheme that will allow the appropriate validated methods to be developedin a prioritized fashion . . .''; however, NIOSH was not in favor of delayingthe implementation date of the final rule because of sampling and analyticaldeficiencies (Ex. 8-47). OSHA has reviewed the few comments and the methods identified. OSHA concludesthat, for all but the seven substances identified below, there is an adequatesampling and analytic method for enforcement purposes. For a few of the substances where OSHA believes there are adequate methods,NIOSH points out that there has not been extensive inter-laboratory crosschecking. This procedure (which is known by the technical term ``validation'')does improve analytic techniques but is not necessary for typical enforcementpurposes. Therefore, OSHA finds that it is appropriate to adopt PELs for all of thosesubstances identified in the Appendix of Section XI as having availablein-house sampling and analytical methods. Copies of information on thesemethods have been submitted to the docket for this rulemaking (Ex. 12)and are available to all parties. Industry and union participants havenot criticized these techniques. In the Proposal, OSHA identified seven substances as not having adequatesampling and analytic techniques for enforcement. OSHA subsequently wasinformed of reasonable techniques for two of these. However, it also determinedthat two other substances with inadequate sampling methods were not listedin the Proposal. The list of seven substances now includes aluminum alkyls,ethylidene norbornene, hexafluoracetone, mercury [alkyl compounds], oxygendifluoride, phenylphosphine and sulfur pentafluoride). OSHA believes it is appropriate to adopt PELs but stay enforcement of thesePELs until adequate sampling and analytical methods are available. At suchtime OSHA will publish in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> its determination that such methods exist (togetherwith a copy of the method), and indicate the proposed effective date forenforcement of the PEL for the substance in question. OSHA notes the overwhelming success of the private sector and the jointefforts of NIOSH and OSHA to develop sampling and analytical methods inthis area in the past. In 1971, at the time of the promulgation of OSHA'soriginal Z-Tables, sampling and analytical methods were available for onlya few of the hundreds of substances on these Tables. In the interveningyears, NIOSH, OSHA and the private sector have developed and tested hundredsof methods and have made these available to the industrial hygiene communityin several volumes of documented methods (<T3>OSHA Analytical Methods Manual </T3>and <T3>NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods</T3>). OSHA is confident that thetwo agencies and the private sector will work together to develop rapidlymethods for these substances. D. Content of Standard The present 29 CFR 1910.1000 contains three Tables and 5 paragraphs. TheTables Z-1, Z-2 and Z-3 express exposure limits for approximately 450 substancesin various formats. Paragraph (a) states how Table Z-1 is to be compliedwith, paragraph (b) how Z-2 is to be complied with and paragraph (c) howTable Z-3 is to be complied with. Paragraph (d) states the rule to be followed if there are exposures tomore than one substance covered by the standard. Paragraph (e) states thehierarchy of controls to be followed in achieving the limit. In OSHA's Proposal, it opened the rulemaking only to the appropriate exposurelimits for 260 substances already included in Tables Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3and 168 substances with no prior exposure limits. OSHA did not open anysubstantive issues as to Paragraphs 1910.1000 (a) through (e), or as tothe approximately 169 substances in Tables Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 for whichOSHA did not propose to consider changes. However, the need for formatchanges was recognized since there would be the need to integrate convenientlyfor the public both the old and new exposure limits. OSHA proposed a new Table Z-4 which included all of the 428 substanceswhich OSHA proposed to consider for new exposure limits. A new paragraph(d) was proposed to indicate how Table Z-4 was to be complied with includingTime-Weighted average (TWA), short term exposure limits (STEL), ceilinglimits and skin designations. The provisions of proposed paragraph (d)were opened for public comment. The other paragraphs were proposed onlyfor format changes so that the new limits could be incorporated withoutconfusion. The existing paragraph (d) was redesignated paragraph (f). There were a number of recommendations by the public on how the exposurelimits could be formatted so they would be more convenient for the publicto use. OSHA has carefully considered how to present the exposure limitsin a manner most convenient for the public. The format of this final standardand Tables reflects that effort. OSHA is deleting Table Z-1 and inserting Table Z-1-A. (The change in nomenclatureis designed to avoid confusion between the two Tables). For the convenienceof the public, Table Z-1-A includes every substance regulated by OSHA insubpart Z. Therefore, Table Z-1-A includes all new substances regulated for the firsttime in this rulemaking, all substances regulated before in Tables Z-1,Z-2, and Z-3 for which OSHA is promulgating new exposure limits and alsothose substances regulated before in Tables Z-1, Z-2, and Z-3 for whichOSHA considered changing exposure limits but concluded that the exposurelimit should remain unchanged. All of these exposure limts were substantivelyconsidered and were at issue in the rulemaking. They have been issued orreissued as section 6(b) standards. Secondly, Table Z-1-A includes several groups of substances which werenot considered for change or opened for comment in this rulemaking. Theyhave been placed in Table Z-1-A for the convenience of the public and reformattedbut no substantive changes have been made. These include 169 substanceswhich had been located in Tables Z-1, Z-2 and Z-3 which OSHA did not proposeto consider changes for and which are carried over substantively unchanged.For some of those substances located before in Tables Z-2 and Z-3, theformat of presentation could not fit into the columns of Table Z-1-A. Inthat case Table Z-1-A references the fact that those substances' limitsappear in Table Z-2 or Z-3. These substances which were not opened for rulemaking and which appearedbefore in Tables Z-1, Z-2, or Z-3 can be identified by having identicallimits in both the Transitional Limits Columns and the Final Rule LimitsColumns of Table Z-1-A. The identical nature of both limits may requireexamination of a cross reference to Table Z-2 or Z-3. All of these substanceswere originally issued as Section 6(a) standards. Also listed in Table Z-1-A are all substances which have individual standardsin Sections 1910.1001 through 1910.1048. In those cases the exposure limitis not listed in Table Z-1-A, but there is a cross reference to the sectionwhere the complete standard for that substance is located. There are also three substances (benzene, cotton dust and formaldehyde)which have single substance standards in 1910.1001 through 1910.1048, forwhich exposure limits in Tables Z-1 or Z-2 were retained for certain sectors,operations or circumstances not covered by the single substance standard.These limits are either presented directly in Table Z-1-A, or are crossreferenced to Table Z-2. An explanatory note indicates where these situationsapply. Through these formatting changes, all substances regulated in Subpart Zare listed in alphabetical order in Table Z-1-A. Also included (where possible)is a CAS number to help identify each substance. This formatting will facilitatethe use of these Z Tables. As discussed above, there will be a transition period. Until September1, 1989, the existing limits of Tables Z-1, Z-2 and Z-3 continue to apply.These are presented, or cross referenced in the Transitional Limits columnsof Table Z-1-A. The methods of compliance hierarchy, as set forth in Sec.1910.1000(e) applies to these limits. For substances where there has beenno change in limits, the methods of compliance specified in para. 1910.1000(e)have been applicable to achieve the limit specified since 1971 and willremain applicable without gap into future unless subsequently amended.The September 1, 1989, and December 30, 1992, dates do not affect the methodsof compliance or exposure limit for substances whose exposure limits havenot been changed. Substances which fit into the unchanged limits categorycan be recognized because the limits specified in both Transitional Limitscolumn and Final Rule Limits columns are the same. Between September 1, 1989, and December 31, 1992, two limits will be applicablefor substances which had an OSHA limit and for which OSHA changed the limitsin this Rulemaking. The methods of compliance hierarchy set forth in 1910.1000(e)will apply to the limits noted in the Transitional Limits columns. Theadditional protection to achieve the more protective limits noted in theFinal Rule Limits columns can be achieved using any reasonable controlmethods as set forth in para. (f)(2)(ii). An example may assist in explaining this requirement. Chemical A has alimit of 100 ppm in the Transitional Limits columns and 50 ppm in the FinalRule Limits columns. Between September 1, 1989, and December 30, 1992,100 ppm must be achieved with the hierarchy of controls specified in Para.1910.1000(e) with its preference for feasible engineering and work practicecontrols. During this period, the additional protection from 100 ppm downto 50 ppm must be achieved by any reasonable combination of engineeringcontrols, work practices and personal protective equipment as specifiedin para. 1910.1000(f)(2)(i). After December 30, 1992, the methods of compliance specified in para. 1910.1000(e)shall apply to the limits specified in the Final Rule Limits column forall substances with changed limits. The limits specified in the TransitionalLimits column shall no longer be applicable. New substances not previously regulated by OSHA have their exposure limitsappear only in the Final Rule Limits columns. For those substances, themethods of compliance specified in para. 1910.1000(f)(2)(i) apply betweenSeptember 1, 1989, and December 30, 1992, to achieve the airborne exposurelimits specified. After December 30, 1992, the methods of compliance specifiedin para. 1910.1000(e) apply. If no final rule has been published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> by December 31, 1991, amending or determiningnot to amend paragraph (e) of this section, then the permissible limitsspecified in the Final Rule Limits columns of Table Z-1-A shall be achievedby the methods of compliance specified by paragraph (e) of this sectioneffective December 31, 1993, and paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section shallremain in effect through December 30, 1993. As discussed above, some substances are listed in the Transitional Limitsor Final Rule Limits columns by cross reference to Table Z-2 or Z-3. Thosesubstances are considered to be in the Transitional Limits columns or FinalRule Limits columns just the same as if the exposure limits were presentedin those columns. Consequently, the methods of compliance apply the same,whether the exposure limit is listed directly or listed by cross referenceto Table Z-2 or Z-3. The operational language for Table Z-1 is in 29 CFR 1910.1000(a) (1988),for Z-2 is in 1910.1000(b) and Z-3 in 1910.1000(c). The language of eachwas not identical because they had different historical sources. It isand has always been OSHA's interpretation that the language, though slightlydifferent, had the same meaning. In this rulemaking the Table Z-1 has been integrated into the TransitionalLimits columns of Table Z-1-A. The operational language that had been in29 CFR 1910.1000(a) (1988) becomes paras. 1910.1000(a) (1) and (2). Paragraphs1910.1000 (b) and (c) are carried over. Some word changes are necessaryto these paragraphs to integrate Table Z-1-A into the regulatory frameworkand to cover the transitional period. These are just formal changes andno substantive changes in the regulations are intended by the formal changesin the language of paras. 1910.1000 (a)(1), (a)(2), (b) and (c). Paragraphs 1910.1000 (a)(3), (a)(4) and (a)(5) are new. Necessary explanationof them is given below. Paragraph 1910.1000(d) contains the computation formulas when employeesare exposed to more than one toxic substance at the same time and 1910.1000(e)is the hierarchy of controls. OSHA did not open the issue of whether substantivechanges should be made to these paragraphs in the proposal. A few commentswere received recommending substantive changes. OSHA has not consideredthem in this proceeding. This rulemaking is sufficiently broad so thatresources were not available to consider those recommendations and, ofcourse, no notice was given that OSHA was considering changes to theseparagraphs. Accordingly there are no substantive changes to these paragraphsand that was not an issue in the rulemaking. No changes at all are madeto para. (e). It is reprinted unchanged for the convenience of the public.OSHA is making only format changes to para. (d). Those are needed to incorporateTable Z-1-A. They also make clear OSHA's existing position that para. (d)applies to all of Subpart Z. See 53 FR 21241. The names of chemicals inthe example are changed to A, B, and C since the exposure limits for thenamed chemicals have been changed. This should prevent confusion. All ofpara. (d) is reprinted for the convenience of the public. It should benoted that paragraph (d) had been proposed to be redesignated as paragraph(f) in the Proposal. In the final rule that has not been necessary becauseof the change in format. In addition, since OSHA is proposing no changes to Part 1917, Marine Terminals,which references the existing Z-1, Z-2 and Z-3 Tables, the limits shownin the Transitional Limits columns of Table Z-1-A or the limits columnsof Z-2 and Z-3 will remain in effect for Marine Terminals. (OSHA in a follow-uprulemaking will consider adoption of new limits for the Construction andMaritime Industries.)For some substances, OSHA proposed using the 10-hour TWA given in the NIOSHRELs as a new PEL. It should be noted that NIOSH generally refers in itscriteria documents to airborne concentrations of a substance as a ``time-weightedaverage (TWA) exposure for up to a 10-hour work shift in a 40-hour workweek.'' OSHA has concluded that this is equivalent to the OSHA definitionof an 8-hour work shift for a 40-hour work week. OSHA received limitedcomments regarding this question. NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) provided the most detailedresponse explaining the history of the 10-hour TWA and why the same TWAREL was intended to be applied to 8-hour and 10-hour work days in a 40-hourwork week. NIOSH explained that the 10-hour REL originated during the energycrisis of the 1970s, when many employers began to use 10-hour/4-day workschedules to conserve energy (Ex. 8-47, p. 25). Thus, the 40-hour workweek rather than the length of a workday is, in NIOSH's view, the importanttime element in the (concentration) X (time) equation: any given REL canbe applied to either four 10-hour days or five 8-hour days without beingexceeded. NIOSH supports OSHA's proposal to apply 10-hour NIOSH RELs to8-hour days by stating: <ITAG tagnum="21">The action proposed by OSHA in this rulemaking relative to these RELsis consistent with that original intent (Ex. 8-47, p. 26).</ITAG>In this final rule, OSHA is therefore applying certain values derived from10-hour NIOSH RELs as 8-hour TWA PELs. NIOSH REL ceiling values are based on time intervals which range from instantaneousto 120 minutes. OSHA asked in the Proposal whether, for convenience ofenforcement fewer time limits could be used. There were a few commentswhich gave support to this possibility. After consideration of the record,OSHA has concluded that PELs based on REL ceilings of 10, 15 and 20 minutesshall be made 15-minute STEL's in order to achieve greater uniformity andsimplicity in the standard. However, OSHA has decided that the 30-minute,60-minute and 120-minute ceilings, if adopted, shall remain as specifiedsince those times are so different. The ceiling limits in Table Z-1-A are consistent with the ACGIH definition.If instantaneous measuring devices are available, then the ceiling limitshall not be exceeded in an instantaneous measurement. If instantaneousmeasuring devices are not available, then the exposure is to be measuredover a 15-minute period. Therefore, some of the ceiling limits are equivalentto STELs.OSHA proposed PELs for some substances where the basis for the proposalalso included a carcinogenicity designation (e.g., TLV with an A1 or A2designation; REL with a Ca designation). OSHA asked in the Proposal whethersuch chemicals should have a cancer designation included in the table.Some commenters (Exs. 3-741 and 3-891) indicated that OSHA's Hazard CommunicationStandard already requires employers to inform employees about the carcinogenichazards of any substances listed as carcinogens by IARC or NTP. Accordingto these respondents, identification of substances as carcinogens in theZ-Tables would therefore be duplicative and could cause confusion (Ex.3-891). Other commenters (Exc. 3-593, 3-1095, 8-16 and 8-47) favored theaddition of a cancer designation to carcinogenic substances included inthe Z Tables. For examples, the American Industrial Hygiene Association(AIHA) stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">AIHA would support the inclusion of a designation on carcinogenicity . . . provided that such designation reflects the weight of evidence forcarcinogenic effects . . . . (Ex. 8-16, p. 14).</ITAG>NIOSH (Ex. 8-47) concurred in recommending the inclusion of such a designationin the final rule's Z-Tables. OSHA has carefully reviewed the record evidence on this issue and has investigatedthe various evaluative criteria used by scientific and regulatory bodiesto determine the classification of a substance as a carcinogen. The Agencynotes that each organization has a different system and that the criteriaused rarely coincide. Thus, the ACGIH uses two designations, A1 and A2,to reflect the strength of the evidence for a substance's carcinogenicitywhile the EPA has 5 classifications that represent different kinds of evidence.OSHA believes that the inclusion of a cancer designation on the Z-Tableswould further complicate this already complex situation by adding yet anotherclassification system to those already in use. OSHA is also concerned thatadding cancer designation to the Z-Table limits would require frequentupdating and revision as additional substances are identified as carcinogensin the future. Therefore, OSHA has determined not to add a cancer designationto the Tables. Paragraphs 1910.1000 (a)(3), (a)(4) and (a)(5) are new. Paragraph (a)(3)requires an employer to maintain an employee's exposure below the TimeWeighted Average (TWA), Short Term Exposure Limit (STEL) and/or Ceilingspecified in the Final Rule Limits Columns of Table Z-1-A. Paragraph (a)(5)defines those limits. The language of these two paragraphs is consistentwith OSHA past practices and good industrial hygiene. The record of thisrulemaking supports the approach taken to the language. OSHA intends thislanguage to be interpreted consistent with similar language in 1910.1000(a)(1), (a)(2), (b) and (c). Paragraph (a)(4) puts limits on skin exposure. It states: <ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Skin Designation.</T3> To prevent or reduce skin absorption, an employee'sskin exposure to substances listed in Table Z-1-A with an X in the skincolumn under the Final Rule Limits column shall be prevented or reducedto the extent necessary under the circumstances through the use of gloves,coveralls, goggles or other appropriate personal protective equipment,engineering controls or work practices.</ITAG>This reflects both format and substantive changes from the language proposed.This preamble discussion also reflects a substantive change from the discussionin the proposal. The substantive changes are in response to many commentsin the record.The ACGIH gave skin designation to substances which could be absorbed throughthe skin. The proposal preamble stated that the skin notation was usedto indicate both substances absorbed through the skin and those which mightcause skin irritation. There was much public comment pointing out thatthe underlying documentation considered only skin absorption and not skinirritation. It also pointed out that the two concepts should not be confusedbecause a substance that could be absorbed might not irritate, and conversely.OSHA agrees with these comments and their reasoning. Accordingly a skindesignation for the final rule is only given to a substance which may beabsorbed through the skin.The use of skin designation does not indicate that the substance may irritatethe skin. Similarly, lack of a skin designation does not mean that thesubstance will not irritate the skin.The purpose of having the skin designation is to prevent the same toxiceffects that the chemical causes through inhalation. The inhalation limitis based on keeping exposure below the limit which will create a significantrisk of material impairment of health. If skin absorption is possible,an employee might be below the inhalation limit; however, the additionalbody burden through skin absorption may create the material impairmentwhich the limit attempts to reduce.The revised language permits compliance with personal protective equipmentsuch as gloves, goggles and coveralls, engineering controls or work practices.No specific hierarchy is stated. An employer must take appropriate actionsto prevent routine or regular exposures. However, except when there isthe reasonable possibility of slight, a severe reaction through absorption,the methods need not be such as to prevent the possibility of slight infrequentexposure. This language reflects comments in the record that preventingthe possibility of exposure is not always necessary to prevent materialimpairment of health.Many existing substances have a skin designation which is indicated inthe Transitional Limits columns. Para. (f)(2)(iii) states that they shallremain in effect until August 31, 1989. The skin designations in the FinalRule Limits columns take effect on September 1, 1989. This is sufficienttime for employers to institute control practices.Para. (f)(3)(iii) states that if any of the revised limits are stayed thenthe limits existing prior to this final rule remain effective until thestay is lifted. If a revised limit is vacated, then the limit existingprior to this final rule remains effective.Para. (f)(4) stays the enforcement of PELs for seven substances for whichOSHA is not aware of a practical sampling and analytic technique as ofNovember 10, 1988, the close of the record. When a suitable method becomesavailable OSHA will publish a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notifying the public of the method and settinga date ending the stay.E. State Plan ApplicabilityThe 25 states with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety and healthplans must adopt a comparable standard within six months of the publicationdate of this final standard. These States include: Alaska, Arizona, California,Connecticut, (for State and local government employees only), Hawaii, Indiana,Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, NewYork, (for state and local government employees only), North Carolina,Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia,Virgin Islands, Washington, Wyoming. Until such time as a State Standardis promulgated, Federal OSHA will provide interim enforcement assistance,as appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 1910</ITAG>Air contaminants, Occupational safety and health, Permissible exposurelimits, Health, Risk assessment.<T4>IX.

Appendix_Sampling and Analytical Methods</ITAG>The sampling and analytical methods for the substances listed in SectionII of this preamble are categorized into three groups: (1) Fully ValidatedMethods, (2) Other Methods, and (3) No Methods. These methods are indicatedin the tables in this Appendix. The first table details fully validatedmethods, other methods, substances for which there are no identified methods,and detection limits. The second table identifies the most recent NIOSHAnalytical methods.A. Fully Validated MethodsFully Validated methods were developed by either NIOSH or OSHA. The criteriaused in validating these procedures were developed independently by eachagency. There are some differences in validation protocol, but in generalsimilar testing procedures were followed. These methods are widely acceptedby the scientific community.B. Other MethodsMethods in this category have not been subjected to all of the testingprocedures required of fully validated methods. Some of these procedureshave been taken directly from scientific literature and may not have beenused by OSHA. Some are methods that were validated for a specific analyteand OSHA believes are applicable for similar analytes. OSHA has reviewedthese methods and has concluded that they are of adequate quality to beused for assessing exposures and for enforcement.C. No MethodsThese analytes do not have an adequate sampling method available at OSHA,nor has an appropriate method been found in the available scientific literature.D. Detection LimitsThe values listed under Detection Limits are the lowest air concentrationsthat can be monitored, based on recommended sample air volumes. Detectionlimits for the OSHA validated methods are determined during the evaluation.The detection limits listed for the in-home methods are the estimate ofOSHA. <ITAG tagnum="6">SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL METHOD</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLIONG CODE 4510-26-M023 </ITAG></ITAG><T4>Federal Register</T4> / Vol. 54, No. 12 / Thursday, January 19, 1989/ Presidential Documents<ITAG tagnum="4">Federal Register</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Vol. 54, No. 12 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Thursday, January 19, 1989</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3"/><ITAG tagnum="6">Title 3_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="7">The President</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">Presidential Determination No. 89-9 of December 22, 1988</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="41">Economic Assistance to Fiji</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Memorandum for the Secretary of State</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">By virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 614(a)(1) of theForeign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, I hereby:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(1) determine that it is important to the security interests of theUnited States to authorize the disbursement of Fiscal Year 1986 EconomicSupport and Development Assistance Health Funds for Fiji allocated beforethe May 14, 1987 military coup and to reinstate Fiji's eligibility forfuture allocations of economic assistance to Fiji, notwithstanding Section513 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs AppropriationsAct, 1989 (and successor provisions of substantially similar effect) and;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(2) authorize the furnishing of such assistance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">You are requested to report this Determination to the Congress immediately,and none of the assistance provided for herein shall be furnished untilafter such report has been made.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This Determination shall be published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4><ITAG tagnum="65">andPres;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="13">THE WHITE HOUSE,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Washington, December 22, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">[FR Doc. 89-1341</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Filed 1-17-89; 1:39 pm]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="50">Billing code 3195-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
