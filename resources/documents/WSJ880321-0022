Jacobs (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> TAXES GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is suing New York City and New York state for devising a way to tax federal aid to savings institutions.    The case makes New York state seem almost ungrateful for the way it responded to a federal law that pumped $675 million of Uncle Sam's funds into 21 troubled New York thrifts a few years ago.    The law, known as the Garn Act, authorized the FDIC to supply capital to troubled savings institutions that qualified for the aid. From 1982 to 1987, thrifts in New York received more than $675 million in aid under the law, which also was written to exempt recipients of the assistance from state and local taxes on their deposits.    But some in New York state's tax department interpreted the law to minimize the exemption period. New York City adopted the state's interpretation and collected $1.7 million of tax from the Bowery Savings Bank, according to a lawsuit the FDIC filed last week.    Among other things, the suit asks the federal district court in Manhattan to order the city to refund the money.    &quot;New York was the only state that attempted to collect the tax,&quot; said David G. Greene, an attorney at Thacher Proffitt andamp; Wood, a New York law firm representing the FDIC in the case.    At issue is the meaning of a phrase in the law that says the tax exemption is in effect &quot;during any period&quot; the institutions have outstanding net worth certificates issued to the FDIC for the assistance money. The state read the law to mean the exemption period began when the net worth certificates were issued.    Because the Bowery first received aid and issued the certificates in December 1982, it was subject to tax for 11 months of 1982, under the state's reading of the law. But the FDIC contends that Congress clearly intended the exemption to apply for the whole year.    New York state already has refunded money it collected under that interpretation of the federal law, Mr. Greene asserted, but the city refuses to do so.    The city didn't respond to requests for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
