The hotel and gambling concern said it will retain a majority stake in the partnership, called Sahara Casino Partners L.P., and will sell a portion of the partnership interests in an initial public offering. Paul Lowden, chairman and chief executive officer of Sahara Resorts, declined to say exactly what stake his company would retain in the partnership.    Mr. Lowden said proceeds from the offering will be used to pay off debt and for the $35 million renovation of the Sahara Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas that will include the addition of a 575-room tower.    Mr. Lowden said his company decided to form a limited partnership because of the tax advantages available to that type of entity.    In addition to the Sahara Hotel and Casino, Sahara Resorts owns and operates the Hacienda Resort Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. </TEXT></DOC>
