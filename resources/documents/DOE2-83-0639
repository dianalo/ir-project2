<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-83-0639 </DOCNO><TEXT>The design study for the TRIUMF Kaon Factory has recently been funded.A short discussion of the scientific motivation is given first, followedby a brief description of the 30 GeV synchrotron which is being proposed.There will be five rings altogether using the present TRIUMF 500 MeVcyclotron as an injector. If the project is funded in 1990 the acceleratorswould be completed in 1995 or so, and the experimental programme wouldstart a year later. 15 refs., 2 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
