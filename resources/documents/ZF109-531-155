Conte, the deputyassistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs.andP;  Conte also serves on theCIM steering committee.andP;  Kendall oversees both the steering committee and thegroup establishing long-term systems requirements.andM;In June, O'Keefe directed CIM requirements groups to look for interimstandard systems to serve departmentwide needs, if such systems can be found.andM;A likely candidate for both the interim and final finance management systemis the Army's Standard Financial System Redesign (STANFINS-R), a project thatnearly is complete after nine years of programming in which 2 million linesof Ada code have been produced.andM;In April, Maj.andP;  Gen.andP;  Albert Edmonds, the Air Force's assistant chief ofstaff for command, control, communications and computers, said the servicewill &quot;take advantage of STANFINS.&quot;andP;  Army officials have touted significantcost savings in STANFINS-R because of ADA's potential for decreased softwaremaintenance.andM;The Air Force canceled plans for a $60 m illion million financial system ofits own late last year in response to a directive by Kendall.andP;  STANFINS willbe the system that collects data from bases and installations and reports toArmy headquarters and other accounting authorities, officials have said.andM;In a recent interview, Jeffcoat said most STANFINS design work has beenfinished.andP;  Testing will begin this month and is scheduled to end in Novemberon the main body of the system, which Jeffcoat said does general and costaccounting.andP;  The first subsystem, which processes and tracks traveldisbursements and commercial accounts, was installed two years ago, he said.andM;Jeffcoat also said the CIM plan probably will result in more compelingchanges for financial management in DOD than the consolidation will cause.andO;In an interview last year, he expressed doubts that consolidation wouldamount to more than an &quot;organizational solution to a technical problem.&quot;andM;The 40-member consolidation team is working in Arlington, Va., and is knowninformally as the &quot;implementation group&quot; for the defense financial servicescenter.andP;  Mary Harden, a spokeswoman for the group, said it might choose adifferent name for the center someday.andM;Also unclear at this time, according to officials, is where the center willbe located or how much staff will be needed.andM;Existing organizations being consolidated by Conte's implementation group arethe Army Finance and Accounting Center in Indianapolis; Navy Accounting andFinance Center in Arlington, Va.; Navy Finance Center in Cleveland; Air ForceAccounting and Finance Center in Denver; Defense Logistics Agency FinanceCenter in Columbus, Ohio; and the Washington Headquarters Services Financeand Accounting Operations in the Pentagon.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
