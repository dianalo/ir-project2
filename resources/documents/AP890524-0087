(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   With Gov. George Deukmejian's signingof two bills today, California becomes the first state to banmilitary-style assault weapons.   The legislation the Republican governor planned to sign wouldban the manufacture and sale of more than 50 semiautomatic rifles,pistols and shotguns on Jan. 1.   Attempts to restrict such weapons had been blocked repeatedly bythe gun lobby, led by the National Rifle Association, until ashooting rampage at a Stockton school four months ago left fivechildren and the gunman dead.   The slayings by a deranged drifter carrying a semiautomaticAK-47 rifle rallied the public support needed to push the measurethrough.   Under the legislation, people who owned the listed weaponsbefore June 1 may keep them by obtaining permits. Otherwise, theguns can be possessed only with a special-needs permit, such asthose obtained by movie studios for machine guns.   Possession would be a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year injail and a $1,000 fine, or a felony, carrying up to three years inprison. The bills would also increase the penalties for crimes inwhich assault weapons are used.   The bills would allow the attorney general to go into court toadd similar guns to the list.</TEXT></DOC>
