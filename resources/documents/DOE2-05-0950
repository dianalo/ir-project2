When looking for ways to reduce energy consumption, one can suggestto cut the energy services such as lowering room temperatures, walkinginstead of driving a car, less light in the streets, and slower replacementof durable goods. Many such proposals make good sense and do not necessarylead to a lower quality of life, often the opposite/sup (1)/. However,in this paper we will not consider such cuttings in energy services,but rather look at the options for saving energy by improving the efficiencyof the technology used to provide the services. 10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
