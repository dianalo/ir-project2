(tutorial)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Bermar, Amy.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Design and manufacturing play the greatest role in bringing aproduct to market in most companies, but design engineers andmanufacturing engineers have different goals and separatelanguages.andP;  For any effort at concurrent engineering to besuccessful, the two groups must be helped to find common ground.andO;Learning to design for manufacturability, or produceability, issimplified by following a few guidelines that are applicable tomost industries.andP;  Minimize the number of parts used and make itobvious that those parts can be assembled in only one manner.andO;Design verifiability into the project.andP;  Avoid tight tolerancesthat can mount up on connected parts, exceeding allowedspecifications.andP;  Design in excessive capabilities to allow formanufacturing uncertainties.andP;  Minimize the need for manualassembly.andP;  Use common parts and materials.andP;  Design modularproducts that facilitate assembly.andP;  Provide easy access to theparts most likely to need service.andP;  Beyond these guidelines,ensure clear communication and ongoing contact among the variousdisciplines involved in the project.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     AnalysisManufacturingGuidelinesTutorial.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
