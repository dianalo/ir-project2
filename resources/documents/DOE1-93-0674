Five main topics are covered: 1) the autocrinemode of action of some beta IFNs which function as growth inhibitorsduring terminal differentiation of hematopoietic cells. 2) The molecularmechanisms by which IFN reduces c-myc expression. 3) The basis of escapefrom the IFN mediated c-myc inhibition detected in some leukemic cells.4) Antagonism between platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and IFN withregard to c-myc expression. 5) Cooperatoin between IFN and TNF in switchingoff the c-myc gene and reducing proliferation of transformed cells. Theauthors' overall study results suggest that the escape from a negativecontrol is an important step, not studied before in the development ofmalignant transformation. In parallel, their findings are optimisticfrom a therapeutical point of view as they offer the opportunity to identifythe leukemic clones which did not lose their antimitogenic sensitivitybased on the extensive molecular study which they provide.</TEXT></DOC>
