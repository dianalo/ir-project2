NSR regulations were and are established as a check point throughwhich plans for a source must pass. The equipment and processes of theseplans are compared to the standards for equipment and processes of an industrialcategory into which the plant falls. If all of the elements of the proposedprocess are in compliance with the guidelines of the NSR regulation, itis reasonable to predict that the environmental harm will be minimal forsuch a plant being built.The State of New Mexico seeks to establish NSR regulations that would allowthe State to issue permits to allow sources to construct or modify processesin areas where a NAAQS is being exceeded, without interfering with thecontinuing progress toward attaining the standard. The EPA approved theNew Mexico Control Strategy demonstrating attainment of the NAAQS (PartD SIP) on April 10, 1980 (45 FR 24509) with a condition that revisionsto permit regulations be submitted to EPA. The Governor of New Mexico (TheGovernor), in an May 20, 1980, letter to EPA, committed to continue (inthe meantime) the policy of not issuing permits to new or modified majorsources in all New Mexico nonattainment areas. The Governor submitted theadopted regulation to EPA on November 5, 1985, for incorporation into theSIP.This regulation (AQCR 709) applies to all the State of New Mexico withthe exception of Bernalillo County. In accordance with Section 74-2-4 ofthe State of New Mexico Air Quality Control Act, this county is authorizedto provide for the local administration and enforcement of the Act.The Clean Air Act (as amended August 1977) (Act) sets forth requirementsfor plans for nonattainment areas in Part D of the Act. Section 172 setsforth nonattainment plan provisions and section 173 sets forth permit requirements.The Act requires that EPA develop regulations to filfill the requirementsof the Act. The regulations that fulfill this requirement are found in40 CFR Part 51, Subpart I, Review of New Sources and Modifications. A StateImplementation Plan (SIP) satisfying sections 172(b)(6) and 173 of theAct is required to meet the conditions as set forth in 40 CFR 51.165(a).The State of New Mexico submitted a SIP revision in 1979 to fulfill thenonattainment area requirements of the Act. The SIP revision was conditionallyapproved. It had a shortcoming in that it did not have a NSR program fornonattainment areas. As a temporary substitution for this requirement,the Governor agreed to institute a construction ban on all new major sourcesand modifications until such time as a NSR permitting program for nonattainmentareas could be instituted and approved. EPA agreed to this. The State hasfulfilled the requirements of this deficiency by submitting the permittingprogram regulations for nonattainment areas in the form of New Mexico AQCR709.The sources to which New Mexico AQCR 709 apply are new and modified sourcesthat: (1) Are in a nonattainment area and would emit the nonattainmentpollutant in a specific amount (10 lb/hr or 25 tpy), or (2) are locatedwithin an attainment area, but their emissions would have a significantimpact on a neighboring nonattainment area. The nonattainment areas forNew Mexico are: (1) Grant County for sulfur dioxide (SO<T2>2</T2>) and total suspended particulates (TSP); and (2) BernalilloCounty for carbon monoxide (CO) and TSP. Pursuant to 74-2-4 of New Mexico'sAir Quality Control Act, Bernalillo County is authorized to administeran independent program, however, and AQCR 709 does not apply to BernalilloCounty.EPA reviewed AQCR 709 for compliance with the requirements of Title 40of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR), Part 51, and for compliancewith Part D of Title I of the Clean Air Act, as amended.\1\<NOTE/> This review is available at the EPA Region 6 address listedabove. The highlights of the review are given below.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Evaluation Report for New Mexico Air Quality Control Regulation709, Permits Nonattainment Areas, February 1988.New Mexico AQCR 709 applies to the same types of sources as New MexicoAQCR 702, the permitting regulation for sources in all areas of the state,which EPA approved as a SIP requirement in 1973 (38 FR 12704). New MexicoAQCR 702 is for sources in NAAQS attainment areas, whereas New Mexico 709is for sources in NAAQS nonattainment areas. Consequently, both regulationsrequire permits of new or modified sources with new or increased emissionsgreater than 10 pounds per hour or 25 tons per year or with emissions ofa hazardous pollutant.The baseline in AQCR 709 for calculating emission reduction credit foroffsets is the most stringent emission limitation applicable to the source,whether federal or state, including a federally enforceable permit whichis applicable and in effect at the time the application to construct isfiled. Where there is no emission limitation for the particular sourceof offsets in either a state AQCR or federally enforceable permit, actualemissions from which offset credit is obtained will form the baseline.Where the allowable emissions from the offsetting source are greater thanits potential to emit, the potential to emit forms the baseline. Shutdowncredits for offsetting are also allowed by AQCR 709 with the same restrictionscurrently found at 40 CFR 51.165(a)(3)(ii)(c) (formerly 40 CFR 51.18(J)(3)(ii)(c)).The regulation requires, as a general rule, an emission reduction (offset)that is at least 20 percent greater than the proposed new allowable emissions,allowing the requirement of EPA regulations for a net air quality benefitto be achieved. Provision is made for the excess to be either greater orlelss than 20 percent if circumstances indicate another amount is moreappropriate.New sources and modifications are required by AQCR 709 to meet and maintainthe Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER). Additionally, all major stationarysources owned or operated in the State by owners or operators of the proposednew source or modification must be in compliance with or on a complianceschedule for all applicable emission limitations.Section B.8 of AQCR 709 requires new sources and modifications to undergoperformance testing. The section allows a source to be exempted from thisrequirement, however, at the discretion of the Director of the New MexicoEnvironmental Improvement Division (NMEID). A source is further allowed,subject to approval of the NMEID, to propose its own type of performancetest. On its face, section H would allow New Mexico to waive or amend performancetesting required by NSPS and NESHAPS. Discussions with the staff of NMEID,however, indicate that the regulation was not adopted with such an intentand will not be administered in that fashion. Prior to EPA's final approvalof the regulation, however, it will be necessary for the State to supplementthe record with a written commital letter agreeing not to waive or amendNSPS or NESHAPS mandated performance testing.Section H of AQCR 709 contains a provision for banking of emission reductionsthat will be used as offset credits. The regulation contains requirementsto ensure the reductions are surplus, permanent, enforceable, and quantifiable.New Mexico contains only one area, Bernalillo County, which was grantedan extension until December 31, 1987, for attainment of the NAAQS for carbonmonoxide. Section 172(b)(11)(A) of the Clean Air Act requires nonattainmentarea permitting regulations for extension areas to contain a provisionrequiring proposed new major sources or major modifications to performalternate siting analysis. This analysis must demonstrate that the benefitsof locating the source of modification in the extension nonattainment areasignificantly outweigh the environmental cost. Under the provisions ofState law, Bernalillo County and the City of Albuquerque, through theirjoint Air Quality Control Board, have the sole authority to issue new andmodified source permits within the geographical limits of Bernalillo County.The nonattainment area permitting regulations for Albuquerque/BernalilloCounty will address alternate siting. AQCR 709 is not required to and doesnot contain such a provision.Proposed new major stationary sources or major modifications which wouldlocate in a nonattainment area and which could potentially degrade visibilityin Mandatory Federal Class I areas would be required by AQCR 709 to demonstrateconsistency with progress toward the national visibility goal. Sourcesmay take into account costs and time necessary for compliance, the energyand non-air quality environmental impacts of compliance and the usefullife of the source. The state regulation also contains a provision requiringnotification of the affected Federal Land Managers and for modeling ofthe environmental effects of the source or modification and associatedgrowth. The visibility protection regulations contained in AQCR 709 pertainonly to nonattainment area sources and are one element of a comprehensivevisibility protection plan.The definitions in AQCR 709 all either exactly or substantially correlatewith the federal definitions found in the CFR and the Clean Air Act. Thereis, however, no definition of volatile organic compound (VOC). Resolutionof this deficiency is addressed below.NM AQCR 709, section L(7), defines the term ``Building, structure, facility,or installation''. The Federal definition for ``Building, structure, facility,or installation'', 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(ii), was affected by a court decisionon January 17, 1984. On this date the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit(NRDC vs. EPA) reaffirmed the exclusion of the ``to and from'' vessel emissionsfrom the secondary emissions calculations (40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(viii)),but overturned the applicability exclusion for all dockside vessel emissionsthat could be attributable to stationary sources (i.e. marine terminals),and the court remanded the issue of whether dockside vessel emissions shouldbe included in primary emission calculations to the agency for furtherconsideration. EPA has not yet completed that consideration, but currentagency policy dictates that states not exempt dockside vessels from theirdefinitions of ``building, structure, facility, or installation.'' NewMexico's definition, at section L(7) of AQCR 709 does not exempt docksidevessels and is approvable.It is necessary that regulation 709 be in compliance with the Federal StackHeight and Dispersion Technique Regulations. The Governor of New Mexicosubmitted to EPA on August 15, 1986, a SIP revision for Stack Height andDisperson Technique Regulations. EPA proposed to approve the State StackHeight Regulations on September 25, 1987, (52 FR 36054), contingent uponNMEID resolving and correcting certain deficiencies. The State has incorporatedthe EPA comments and revised the regulation, and is in the process of adoptingand submitting it to EPA for final approval.The EPA's stack height regulations were challenged in <T3>NRDC v. Thomas,</T3> 838 F.2d 1224 (D.C. Cir. 1988). On January 22,1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued its decisionaffirming the regulations in large part, but remanding three provisionsto the EPA for reconsideration. These are:1. Grandfathering pre-October 11, 1983 within-formula stack height increasesfrom demonstration requirements (40 CFR 51.100(kk)(2));2. Dispersion credit for sources originally designed and constructed withmerged or multiflue stacks (40 CFR 51.100(hh)(2)(ii)(A); and3. Grandfathering pre-1979 use of the refined H + 1.5L formula (40 CFR51.100(ii)(2)).''Under this program, New Mexico will be issuing permits and establishingemission limitations that may be affected by the court ordered reconsiderationof the stack height regulations promulgated on July 8, 1985 (50 FR 27892).For this reason, the EPA requires that the State include the followingcaveat in all potentially affected permit approvals until the EPA completesits reconsideration of remanded portions of the regulations and promulgatesany necessary revisions:<ITAG tagnum="21">In approving this permit, New Mexico Environmental Improvement Divisionhas determined that the application complies with the applicable provisionsof the stack height regulations as revised by the EPA on July 8, 1985 (50FR 27892). Portions of the regulations have been remanded by a panel ofthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in <T3>NRDC v. Thomas,</T3> 838 F. 2d 1224 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Consequently,this permit may be subject to modification if and when the EPA revisesthe regulation in response to the court decision. This may result in revisedemission limitations or may affect other actions taken by the source ownersor operators.</ITAG>New Mexico must make an enforceable commitment to include this caveat inall affected permits before the EPA can take final action approving theNSR program.Before EPA finally approves the States NSR regulation, AQCR 709 shouldbe amended to address four potential problems. These, along with the State's``plantwide definition of source'', are discussed below:(1) 40 CFR 51.165(a)(3)(ii)(e) requires that the State's plan provide thatall emission reductions claimed as offset credit be federally enforceable.In States with dual permitting requirements, this means that such reductionsmust be reflected in preconstruction permits which are federally enforceable,as opposed to other types of permits, e.g., operating permits, which generallyare not. Section G(3) of AQCR 709, however, simply states that ``such reductionsshall be incorporated as modifications to pertinent permits.'' BecauseNew Mexico will not issue separate construction and operating permits underAQCR 709, its failure to specify that ``pertinent'' meant ``federally enforceable''appears reasonable. In an abundance of caution, however, and to eliminatethe possibility of confusion in the future, EPA suggests the State addthe words ``federally enforceable'' to the regulation between ``pertinent''and ``permits.''(2) New Mexico AQCR 709 has provisions for offset exemptions in SectionJ (Exemptions to D.4. and D.5.), number 1, part b. (resource recovery facilities).Attainment demonstrations to show attainment of the NAAQS do not existfor all pollutants in all nonattainment areas (secondary TSP and SO<T2>2</T2> for Grant County). Without an attainment demonstration therecan be no growth allowance, which is required for an offset exemption.A qualifying statement must be placed into the regulations that there canbe no exemption from the requirements of D.4 and D.5 for resource recoveryfacilities in nonattainment areas unless there exists a Federally approvedattainment demonstration and a Federally approved growth allowance forthat nonattainment area.(3) New Mexico AQCR 709, under Section H (Banking of Emission Reductions)must have language inserted to the effect that banked emissions shall betreated the same as all other emission reduction credits (ERCS).(4) The regulations must contain a defintion of Volatile Organic Compound(VOC). The EPA recommended definition of VOC is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Volatile Organic Compound (VOC)</T3>_Any organic compound which participatesin atmospheric photochemical reactions; that is, any organic compound otherthan those which the Administrator designates as having negligible photochemicalreactivity. </ITAG>With regard to Section L, Definition number 16, ``Major Stationary Source'':The State has selected the ``plantwide definition.'' On October 14, 1981,the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revised the new source review(NSR) regulations in 40 CFR Part 51 to give States the option of adoptingthe ``plantwide'' definition of stationary source in nonattainment areas(see 46 FR 50766). This definition provides that only physical or operationalchanges that result in a net increase in emissions at the entire plantrequire a NSR permit. For example, if a plant increased emissions at onepiece of process equipment but reduced emissions by the same amount atanother piece of process equipment at the plant there would be no net increasein emissions at the plant, and therefore no modification to the source.The plantwide definition is in contrast to the so-called ``dual'' definition(or a definitional structure like that in the 1979 offset ruling (44 FR3274), which has much the same effect as the dual definition); under thedual definition, the emissions from each physical or operational changeare guaged without regard to reductions elsewhere at the plant. In the October 1981 <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, EPA set forth its rationale for allowinguse of the plantwide definition (46 FR 50766-50769). In its view, allowinguse of the plantwide definition was a reasonable accomodation of the conflictinggoals of Part D of the Clean Air Act (Act); on the one hand, reasonablefurther progress (RFP) and timely attainment of national ambient air qualitystandards (NAAQS), and on the other, maximum State flexibility and economicgrowth. The EPA recognized that use of the plantwide definition would bringfewer plant modifications into the nonattainment permitting process, butemphasized that this generally would not interfere with RFP and timelyattainment primarily because the States under the demands of Part D eventuallywould have adequate State implementation plans (SIP's) in place. For instance,EPA stated: <ITAG tagnum="21">Since demonstration of attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS continuesto be required, deletion of the dual definition increases State flexibilitywithout interfering with timely attainment of the ambient standards andso is consistent with Part D (46 FR 50767 col. 2).</ITAG>The EPA added that in any event the use of a dual definition, by bringingmore plant modifications through the NSR Process or subjecting them tothe construction ban (40 CFR 52.24), may discourage replacement of older,dirtier processes and hence retard not only economic growth, but also progresstoward clean air. The EPA also pointed out that under the plantwide definitionnew equipment would still be subjected to any applicable new source performancestandard and that wholly new plants, as well as any modifications thatresulted in a significant net emissions increase, would still be subjectto NSR. Thus, EPA saw no significant disadvantage in the plantwide definitionfrom the environmental standpoint, as against the advantages from the standpointsof State flexibility and economic growth. It regarded the plantwide definitionas presenting, at the very worst, environmental risks that were manageablebecause of the independent impetus to create adequate Part D plans, andat the best the potential for air quality improvements driven by the marketplace. As a result, EPA ruled that a State wishing to adopt a plantwide definitiongenerally has complete discretion to do so, and it set only one restrictionon that discretion. If a State had specifically projected emission reductionsfrom its NSR program as a result of a dual or similar definition and hadrelied on those reductions in an attainment strategy that EPA later approved,then the State needed to revise its attainment strategy as necessary toaccommodate reduced NSR permitting under the plantwide definition (46 FR50767 col. 2, 50769 col. 1). In 1984, the Supreme Court upheld EPA's action as a reasonable accommodationof the conflicting purposes of Part D of the Act, and hence well withinEPA's broad discretion. <T3>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc.</T3> v. <T3>NRDC, Inc.,</T3> 104 S. Ct. 2778. Specifically, the Court agreed thatthe plantwide definition is fully consistent with the Act's goal of maximizingState flexibility and allowing reasonable economic growth. Likewise, theCourt recognized that EPA had advanced a reasonable explanation for itsconclusion that the plantwide definition serves the Act's environmentalobjectives as well (see 104 S. Ct. at 2792). The EPA today generally reaffirmsthe rationales stated in the 1981 rulemaking. Those rationales were leftundisturbed by the Supreme Court decision. Further, EPA has not receivedany empirical information since the 1981 rulemaking that would requirea departure from the basic reasoning in support of the plantwide definition.On November 5, 1985, the State of New Mexico submitted a SIP revision thatwould add a NSR program for nonattainment areas to the SIP. This programuses a plantwide definition of source. The EPA previously approved thePart D SIP for the relevant nonattainment areas on the basis of an attainmentdemonstration, and the State relied in that demonstration on the constructionban to avoid increases in emissions from new sources. The State, however,has adjusted its attainment strategy demonstration by accounting for anyincreases in emissions caused by the removal of the construction ban byrequesting an additional 20% emissions offset when sources are subjectto major NSR requirements. Therefore, EPA here proposes to approve theadoption of a plantwide definition in accordance with its 1981 action inasmuchas the State has modified its attainment plan to assure RFP and attainmentof the NAAQS on the original schedule approved in the plan. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action </ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve New Mexico AQCR 709.
