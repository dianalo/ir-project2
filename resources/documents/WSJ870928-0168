The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited the Philadelphia-based paper manufacturer for 203 alleged willful violations involving the failure to record workplace injuries during 1985 and 1986, and one improperly recorded injury. OSHA said it is conducting a full safety and health inspection at the Winslow facility, which produces sanitary paper for facial and toilet tissue.    OSHA defines a willful violation as one involving an employer's knowledge of workplace health or safety conditions that don't meet federal requirements, or awareness of a hazardous condition without making a reasonable effort to correct it.    The agency said the Winslow plant underreported such injuries as fractures, back injuries, hernias, strains and sprains.    The action is part of a recently stepped up OSHA campaign against employers' failure to report work-related injuries and illness. The agency says the records are necessary to help employers identify workplace hazards, and to help OSHA target inspections at high-hazard work sites.    In recent months, OSHA has accepted sizable penalty payments from Union Carbide Corp. and Chrysler Corp. to settle charges of record-keeping violations, and has proposed large fines against General Dynamics Corp., Caterpillar Inc., and Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s IBP Inc. unit. The proposed fine against IBP was a record $2.6 million.    Scott Paper has 15 working days to contest the charges and proposed fines before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. OSHA said the company has cooperated in the inquiry, indicating a willingness to correct the reporting problems as soon as possible.    In Philadelphia, Scott Paper said it hadn't had a chance to review the citations in detail, but it considers the proposed fines &quot;excessive.&quot; In a statement, Scott said it believes regulations weren't violated &quot;deliberately or intentionally.&quot;    The company emphasized that Scott employees requiring medical care always receive proper attention.    The Winslow mill is reviewing record-keeping practices to ensure &quot;strict compliance&quot; with OSHA standards, Scott said. The company said most of the record-keeping citations pertain to an alleged failure to record &quot;restricted work&quot; days, referring to days when employees return to work in a light-duty capacity. Also cited was an alleged failure to record certain minor injuries that require treatment such as prescription medication or multiple whirlpool treatments.    A Scott spokesman said that in the past five years, the Winslow mill has had two serious injuries in eight million man-hours, &quot;and both employees returned to work.&quot;    ---   Alfredo Corchado in Philadelphia contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
