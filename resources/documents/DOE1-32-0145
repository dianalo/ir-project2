There are eight sections in this book coveringthe following topics: theory of sputtering and molecular scattering,ion scattering and secondary ion emission, photon interactions with sputteredatoms and molecules, photon- and electron-induced desorption, energyflows in atom and molecule surface interactions, sputtering of clustersand large organic molecules, frozen gas sputtering and charge transferat surfaces, and surface and interface chemistry induced by energeticparticles.</TEXT></DOC>
