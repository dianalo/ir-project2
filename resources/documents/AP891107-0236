Two people were treated for injuries at a hospital.   Motorists said they were suddenly cloaked in darkness as a wallof mud ripped across all four lanes. The renowned highway, marked asState Route 1, links Los Angeles with Malibu, Oxnard and othernorthern coastal communities.   ``All of a sudden it got dark and my sister said, `My God it's alandslide,''' said Judy Lester, a passenger. ``We broke through thedirt, she steered very hard. We went into the side of the hill, dida 360 (-degree turn) and went in backwards. It just engulfed us.''   By late Tuesday, much of the debris had been cleared but thehighway remained closed. Fire officials said homes perched on thehill over the highway, with a panoramic view of the Pacific, were inno immediate danger from the slide.</TEXT></DOC>
