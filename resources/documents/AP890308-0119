In Bush's case, the opinion was solicited by the president andwas welcome _ the Lubbock man told him ``things are going justgreat,'' the president told the press on Tuesday. But the custom ofgiving the government a piece of one's mind is older than thecountry, and, more often than not, the petitions from thecountryside come bearing barbs.   Or splinters. When the construction industry blamed Jimmy Carterfor high interest rates, builders mailed him foot-long two-by-foursto drive home their protest. Read one: ``Please reread your 1976campaign speeches. It's amazing how much you've forgotten in fourshort years.''   The National Archives reached into its storehouses of governmentrecords to celebrate the practice of citizen telling government, ortelling government off. Among the examples on exhibit on thearchives' walls are some of those blunt two-by-fours addressed toCarter.   One lament that might sound familiar to Bush, as he replaces theold Reagan guard with new Bush faces, was the petition MaryKatherine Goodard wrote in 1789 in a failing attempt to remainpostmaster of Baltimore.   ``She hath been discharged without the smallest imputations ofany fault, and without any previous notice whatever,'' her petititonsaid. ``These are but poor rewards indeed for 14 years faithfulservices, performed in the worst of times.''   When the Bill of Rights gave the people the right ``to petitionthe government for a redress of grievances,'' the founding fatherswere only accepting the status quo. The people of America had beenseeking redress long before there was a Constitution.   In 1773, the governor of Connecticut protested to a member ofParliament the closing of the port of Boston in retaliation for theBoston Tea Party. He wrote, ``We are at a loss to conceive how thedestruction of the East India Company's tea could be a just orreasonable ground for punishing so severely thousands of innocentpeople.''   A century later, Annie Davis, a slave from northern Maryland,petitioned Abraham Lincoln with as urgent a question as everconfronts humanity: ``You will please let me know if we are free....''   And nearly a century after that, Earl Gideon put pencil to pad inhis cell in Bay County, Fla., and wrote a petition to the SupremeCourt that moved history.   Gideon was serving five years for breaking into a poolroom. ``Thequestion is very simple,'' he wrote. ``I requested the court toappoint me an attorney and the court refused.''   The Supreme Court agreed and established the right of poordefendants to be represented by lawyers, at the public expense ifneed be.   One of the biggest petitions ever to reach Washington remains asit was received in 1893 _ rolled up on two huge wooden spools. Itconsists of hundreds of sheets, taped together, bearing an estimated150,000 signatures, appealing for the establishment of a federalRoad Department ``for the purpose of promoting knowledge in the artof constructing and maintaining roads.''   Congress took the hint, creating the Office of Road Inquiry inthe Department of Agriculture. Must have pleased the petition'soriginator, a bicycle manufacturer, and his customers.   Few citizens petitioning their government ever did so with morecharm than a grade schooler from Fair Lawn, N.J., who wrote toPresident Ford after he pardoned President Nixon for the crimes ofWatergate:   ``Dear President Ford,   ``I think you are half right and half wrong.   ``Yours truly,   ``Anthony Ferreira.''</TEXT></DOC>
