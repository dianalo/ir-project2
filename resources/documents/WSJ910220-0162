Mrs.Allen's comment that &quot;an estimated 40% of surrogate mothersare on welfare&quot; is untrue. In the five largest surrogateprograms, fewer than 5% of the surrogates selected are at thepoverty level.   Nor is it accurate to say that no state has endorsed aregulatory scheme for surrogacy. New Hampshire, for example,has extensive preconception judicial steps to be followed. Infact, of the 15 states that have enacted legislationaddressing surrogacy, only four prohibit it. The otherseither allow it in some form, or say that surrogate contractsare unenforceable, but say nothing about one's ability toenter into such an arrangement.</LP><TEXT>   With respect to the contractual aspect of surrogacy,contrary to the author's unsupported allegations virtually nosurrogate contract requires amniocentesis (our contracts havenever had such a requirement), and the decision whether toterminate the pregnancy is the surrogate's alone.   Cases such as Anna Johnson's and Mary Beth Whitehead'snever would have occurred had there been adequate screening.Instead of banning surrogate contracts, legislatures shouldregulate the procedure. The worst of all worlds is tocriminalize surrogate programs, because then -- exactly ashappened with the Calverts -- desperate couples will seek outsurrogates on their own, and we will see far &quot;more&quot; problems.Of the approximately 2,000 births to surrogates there has&quot;never&quot; been a relinquishment problem where adequatescreening occurred prior to pregnancy.   The only &quot;tragedy&quot; about surrogacy is that people such asAndrew Kimbrell of the National Coalition Against Surrogacyespouse the hypocrisy that commercialized surrogacy is evil,while at the same time voicing no objection to surrogacywithout a fee. Whatever limited difficulties surroundsurrogacy are present regardless of whether the surrogate ispaid for her services or not. The fact is, surrogacy, whenhandled responsibly, is universally satisfying: to thesurrogate, who knows she has provided a gift of unimaginablevalue; to the couple, who can give their love to a child theyotherwise never would have had; and to the child, who neverwould have existed but for the arrangement.
