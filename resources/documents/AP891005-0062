Eight trains packed with 7,600 refugees arrived after anovernight journey from Prague, Czechoslovakia, where they hadsought refuge in hopes of following other East Germans who wereallowed to emigrate during the weekend.   ``Out of hell, finally!'' shouted one young man from a trainwindow as one of the trains pulled into this northern Bavarian townshortly after dawn today. Some of the refugees had spent 14 hourson board the trains.   In Poland, meanwhile, another 600 East Germans who sought asylumin the West German Embassy in Warsaw were told today they also willbe allowed to flee to West Germany, West German Foreign Ministryspokesman Juergen Chrobog announced.   When trains from Prague began arriving in Hof today, thousandsof refugees leaned out train windows cheering and clapping, whileothers burst into tears of joy. Relief workers handed out food andclean clothing.   East Germany agreed to allow the exodus from the West Germanembassies in Prague and Warsaw _ the second in five days _ onTuesday. It then tried to stop the refugee flood by closing itsborder with Czechoslovakia, the only nation where East Germanscould freely travel.   East Germany made the move to end the exodus of its young andskilled citizens before the hard-line Communist country celebratesits 40th anniversary this weekend.   In a face-saving move, the trains traveled from Prague back intoEast Germany before heading into West Germany so the government inEast Berlin could officially expel the refugees.   Many East Germans tried desperately to reach Prague and join theexodus, but 200 who made it there decided not to take the trains toWest Germany, instead accepting an offer from the East Berlingovernment to return home with a guarantee of emigration within sixmonths.   East Germany had made the offer last week in an effort to getthe refugees who had converged on the Prague and Warsaw embassiesto leave. It was not known why the 200 who accepted the offerbypassed an immediate opportunity to leave on the trains, butfamily considerations in East Germany may have played a role.   Despite the closed border with Czechoslovakia, another 20 EastGermans arrived at the Prague embassy after the trains had departedon Wednesday. They, too, were seeking asylum.   West German Embassy officials initially estimated the number ofrefugees in the embassy at 10,000-11,000 and said they would betraveling on 15 trains to Hof. Only eight trains arrived with 7,600.   In the East German city of Dresden, people fought runningbattles with police, overturned cars and smashed windows of themain ralroad station Wednesday night, witnesses said.   ``We want out! we want out!'' the would-be refugees screamed aspolice swinging truncheons charged to drive them back from the mainrailroad station.   ``An incredible amount of time passed before we could go throughDresden. I think there must have been some disturbances,'' said26-year-old refugee Guido Albrecht of Potsdam.   Witnesses said police also used a water cannon to try todisperse the crowd as the refugee trains passed through. They saidthe police broke up the demonstration after midnight.   British tourist Adrian Maitland said he saw police charge thecrowd several times from a hotel overlooking the railway station.   ``It looks like a battleground,'' he told the BritishBroadcasting Corp. by telephone. ``There are fire engines allaround. There are ambulances. I've seen youths being carried offwith blood streaming down their face.''   Police had also clashed with 5,000 would-be refugees in Dresdenon Tuesday night.   Thousands of East Germans had flocked to train stations andlined tracks in their homeland in hopes of joining the refugeesaboard what could be the last ``freedom trains'' to the West.   The trains' journey West was plagued by delays as policedispersed the crowds before the trains came through. Passengersarriving in Hof said they stopped for some time before goingthrough the Dresden.   ``Saying goodbye like that was indescribable feeling,'' oneyoung refugee said in Hof of the trip through his homeland.   As the first train rumbled into Hof at dawn, a deafening cheerrang out from hundreds of well-wishers who had spent hours waitingin freezing weather.   Interior Ministry official Horst Waffenschmidt told reportersthe trains' doors had been locked in Prague to prevent anyone elsefrom boarding.   On Sunday, 7,000 East Germans arrived in West Germany after EastGermany allowed those crowded in embassies in Prague and Warsaw toleave. Many said they had jumped onto the trains as they passedthrough East Germany.   The clampdown on travel was also likely to severely curb thenumber of East Germans going to reform-minded Hungary, whichspurred the exodus last month by allowing thousands of East Germansto pass through to the West. The shortest route to Hungary fromEast Germany is through Czechoslovakia.   East Germans were frantically trying other avenues to reach WestGermany.   In East Berlin, police Wednesday scuffled with 50 East Germanstrying to enter the U.S. Embassy, witnesses said. Eighteen othersmade it inside the compound Tuesday but agreed late Wednesday toleave with assurances their government will look favorable on theiremigration requests, diplomats said.</TEXT></DOC>
