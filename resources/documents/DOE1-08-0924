Mining andgeologic conditions under which mining equipment operates are analyzed.Reliability of the following equipment types is investigated: shearerloaders, powered supports, chain conveyors, pump stations and other auxiliaryequipment. The mean-time-to-repair and the mean-time-between-failuresof various equipment types are comparatively evaluated. Causes of failuresand elements with the lowest reliability are determined. Effects of generaloverhauls and repair on equipment service life and reliability are analyzed.Spare part manufacturing, spare part management in the Soviet coal industryand models of spare part management recommended for coal mines are evaluated.Statistical data on growth rates, supply and demand, prices and economicaspects of spare part consumption are also given.</TEXT></DOC>
