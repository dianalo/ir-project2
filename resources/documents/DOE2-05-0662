<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-05-0662 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors describe a comprehensive computer system, GENEUS, for extensiveDNA, RNA and protein sequence analysis. The analysis system is developedfor the DEC VAX/VMS computer and uses the EMBL Nucleic Acid SequenceData Library. Help information is available on-line on terminal screen.To speed up system handling, a qualifier oriented user communicationis employed. All results are stored on files making them accessible tothe computer editor. An information retrieval system for the EMBL NucleotideSequence Data Library is also described. A defined data-base interfaceallows connection to other analysis programs.</TEXT></DOC>
