The move came only days after the failure of a Caterpillareffort to restart long-stalled contract talks.</LP><TEXT>   The stage had been set for a wider labor action last week,when -- at the first talks held since negotiations collapsedin late autumn -- UAW representatives swiftly rejected a newproposal from the Peoria, Ill., construction-equipmentconcern. Caterpillar had labeled that bid its &quot;final offer.&quot;   Late Friday night, the 2,700 workers at Caterpillar'sengine division in Mossville, Ill., joined the strike, cedingtheir paychecks in favor of $100-a-week strike benefits fromthe union. The number of Caterpillar's total 16,000UAW-represented workers who have walked off now stands atnearly 11,000.   The union's latest move represents a potentially punishingtactic: Because many of the heavy truck engines the companymakes at the plant are custom-manufactured to fleet-owners'specifications, Caterpillar may have more difficulty shippingfrom stockpiled inventory, the way it has with equipment madeat other struck plants.   A Caterpillar spokesman said the company will seek tocontinue operations at Mossville using salaried personnel.Industry experts, however, consider it to have met with onlylimited success using such workers at other factories.   If the engine operation can't meet demand, customers willlikely turn to Caterpillar truck-engine competitors CumminsEngine Co. and closely held Detroit Diesel Corp.   To date, the troubled economy has represented a big factorin the contract fight. Caterpillar has been able to weatherthe lost production entailed by the strike better than itcould have in more robust times, because demand is so slackand pre-strike inventories were so deep.   As a result, the union's leaders have appeared unwillingto launch a complete shutdown of the company, but have raisedthe ante in increments.   At the struck plants, salaried Caterpillar employees &quot;havecertainly been turning some product out, but inventory hascome down both at the company level and the dealer level,&quot;said Dillon Read analyst Andrew J. Silver.   That &quot;doesn't represent an improvement in demand as muchas a decline in output,&quot; he noted. But &quot;as we move furtherinto 1992,&quot; he said, &quot;a seasonal pickup as well as a possiblecyclical recovery&quot; could make Caterpillar's current inventorylevels inadequate.   At that point, the strike, which began in early November,would begin to hurt Caterpillar much more.   Union leaders have suggested in the past that they mightopt for a &quot;rolling thunder&quot; technique, plaguing plants withshort-term strikes, then hitting another location. UAWofficials were unavailable to comment over the weekend.</TEXT></DOC>
