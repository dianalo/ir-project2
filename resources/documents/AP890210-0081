Sulfur dioxide causes acid rain.   Bush's half-day trip for meetings with Prime Minister BrianMulroney will be his first outside the United States as president.Officials of both countries portray the visit as a chance to getacquainted and set the agenda for future dealings.   Canadians believe Bush will do more than former President Reagandid about acid rain. In his speech to a joint session of CongressThursday night, Bush said, ``the time for action is now.''   He proposed spending $120 million in fiscal 1990 to curb acidrain, roughly $25 million more than was proposed by the Reaganadministration. He also called for timetables to be set for thecurbing of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, but didn'tannounce any deadlines.   The damage done in Canada by sulfur dioxide and other emissionsfrom the United States has been a sore point in relations for years.   William K. Reilly, chosen by Bush to head the EnvironmentalProtection Agency, attracted widespread attention in Canada when, athis nomination hearing in Washington, he said legislation to curbacid rain would be ``first out of the box'' for Bush.   Bush said in Washington on Thursday that his administration willhonor the U.S. commitment to Canada to spend $2.5 billion over fiveyears to develop technologies for cleaner coal production.   Mulroney is in the early months of his second term. HisProgressive Conservative Party won an election Nov. 21 foughtlargely on the free trade agreement he negotiated with the UnitedStates.   Parliament met briefly in December to clear the way for the pactto take effect Jan. 1, and will begin its regular business in Marchor April.   The trade deal phases out remaining tariffs over 10 years,establishes panels to resolve disputes and eases barriers toinvestment and trade in energy and services.   Opponents expressed fear that Canada would be overwhelmed by itsmore populous and economically powerful neighbor. Bush and Mulroneywill discuss application of the agreement, but their main topic fordiscussion is acid rain.   Mulroney had sought a treaty requiring both countries to reduceemissions of toxic fumes. Bush is not expected to be any more eagerfor a treaty than Reagan was, but his willingness to submitlegislation is considered a major step.   Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard said this week Canada wantsa timetable of six to eight years for reducing emissions.   President and Mrs. Bush will spend four hours in Ottawa beforegoing to their home in Kennebunkport, Maine. Mrs. Bush's activitieswill include a visit to a school and a tour of the new NationalGallery with Mila Mulroney, wife of the prime minister.</TEXT></DOC>
