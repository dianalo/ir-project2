The practice had become a minor fad, with the courageous orreckless flinging themselves off, for example, the Eiffel Tower andbouncing headfirst several times in midair.   The government issued its temporary ban last week after a thirddeath this year resulting from the fad.   Emmanuel Bottin, a 27-year-old Frenchman, was killed July 18when the elastic band attaching him to a bridge in the Alps snappedon the third bounce, dropping him into the rocks 100 feet below.   ``This is a new and dangerous physical activity,'' the FrenchInterior and Sports Ministries said in a joint statement late lastweek. ``Such an activity cannot continue without serious guaranteesfor the safety of the participants being required of organizers.''   There was no indication how long it would take to draw upregulations under which the sport could resume.</TEXT></DOC>
