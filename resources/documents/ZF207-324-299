ScheierandM;Three years ago, the management of McDonnell Aircraft Co. put the big chillon Jim Scheller's PC purchases.andM;Telling him they ''have no idea what they're using these computers for,'' amanagement team charged with overseeing spending chopped Scheller's PCacquisition budget by 60 percent and pledged to keep it flat for the next twoyears.andM;However, Scheller is beginning to thaw the corporate wallet with a tool moremicro managers are learning to use: cost-justification.andM;''Many of these [managers] were the PC cowboys of only a few years ago, whowould use their own money to buy a PC or sneak it in,'' said Leslie Fiering,manager of advanced technology with Bankers Trust Co. in New York.andM;But at companies like Northern Telecom Canada, where the installed base ofPCs has grown 40 percent over the last two years, executives are asking ''Whydid we bother?'' said Cindy Gordon, director of business productivity at theMississauga, Ontario, firm.andM;''Management steps in and says 'Wait a minute, kids, that was fun,' '' saidDean Meyer, president of a Ridgefield, Conn., management consulting firm.andP;  ''andO;'We bought all that stuff on good faith.andP;  Now prove to me it was worth itbefore I let you go any further.' ''andM;The easiest and most obvious answer is the ''hard dollar'' or tangiblesavings.andP;  For example, when the Paul Revere Insurance Group in Worcester,Mass., began planning a document-imaging system, a task force calculated thesavings on everything from clerks to manila folders, according to BrianSmith, director of the company's record-management systems.andM;The task force went on to interview workers such as those who evaluatemedical and financial records to decide who should get a policy.andP;  Thequestion: How much time do employees spend looking for the papers they needto make a decision?andP;  Including pay, benefits and other costs, the task forceestimated that the workers wasted 10 percent of their time on the paperchase.andM;But for a system expected to cost $2 million to $3 million just to get offthe ground, such ''productivity'' savings weren't enough, he said.andP;  ''Youhave to really analyze how you were impacting how the company doesbusiness,'' Smith added.andM;So, the task force went beyond that to estimate the competitive advantage ofissuing policies more quickly -- which would mean its agents get theircommissions more quickly and would more likely do business with Paul Revere.andM;Estimating the sales impact of a computerized order system is ''tricky,''Smith acknowledged, but he also recommended asking the marketing staff inone's company for an estimate.andM;When the marketing department comes up with a new product, he said,''Somebody makes a guess that we'll sell X amount of it.andP;  If I can reduce theprocess so [the customer] is getting the product faster -- how many morepolicies can they write? -- I think the sales people can come up withanswers.''andM;At McDonnell, in St. Louis, Scheller used a plan for quantifying''intangible'' benefits recommended by Meyer, the analyst.andP;  The three steps:identify how the PC changed a worker's behavior; determine why the new workmethod is better than the old one; and determine the dollar value of theimprovement.andM;For example, one worker was using a PC database to automatically send testdata from an engineering office to a testing lab, instead of sending theinformation in handwritten form.andP;  ''The user thought he was gettingtremendous savings in 200 man-hours per year,'' Scheller said.andM;But by using Meyer's analysis, the firm found the application actually letengineers perform more tests in a shorter time.andP;  That meant higher-qualitycomponents going into the fighter jets McDonell produces, fewer test flightsand fewer ''incidents,'' such as accidents or forced landings.andM;The real savings, he said, comprised hundreds of thousands of dollars peryear, or more than 20 times the savings in manpower the user thought he wasgetting.andP;  And when Scheller presented his findings to management last summer,''We got 30 percent more dollars using this business-based approach insteadof saying, 'It's going to save us so many man-hours.' ''andM;McDonnell's experience is typical of what other companies are finding: Thebest use for PCs may not be doing the same work with fewer people, but doingmore and better work with the same number of people.andM;For this reason, the new emphasis on cost-justification is ''not allnegative,'' argued Robert McDowell, a partner with Arthur Young andamp; Co., amanagement consulting firm in San Francisco.andP;  ''We're using it as a catalystto rethink what we're doing and possibly change the way we work for thebetter.''andO;</TEXT></DOC>
