Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Mastro on Tuesday sought apreliminary injunction to ``protect the membership from their ownleadership.''   The government wants liaison officers appointed and empowered to``discipline Teamsters corruption'' and appoint trustees forcorrupt locals.   But Teamsters attorney John R. Climaco asked U.S. District JudgeDavid Edelstein to give the union more time to counter ``what weconsider the false and shameful allegations by the government.''   Edelstein did not indicate when he would rule on the governmentrequest.   Last week the government, claiming the Teamsters were dominatedby the Mafia, filed a civil racketeering lawsuit seeking to placethe 1.6 million-member union under a court-appointed trustee whowould oversee `free and fair'' elections.   The lawsuit also sought to oust any member of the union's18-member executive board found to have committed or aided thecommission of racketeering activities.</TEXT></DOC>
