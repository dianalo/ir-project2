Marcos, president for 20 years, was forced into exile inFebruary 1986 and died in Hawaii on Sept. 28 at age 72. PresidentCorazon Aquino has refused to allow his body to be brought to thePhilippines.   The demonstrators had permission for an all-night rally outsideCamp Crame, but would not honor an agreement made by their leadersto disperse at dawn.   As the sun rose, the remaining loyalists locked arms and jeeredwhen military officers reminded them of the agreement and shouted``Go home! Go home!''   Two water cannons emerged from the main gate at about 6 a.m. andsprayed the Marcos loyalists. Soldiers and police chased groups ofthem down side streets and the fleeing protesters responded withstones.   No arrests were reported. Three news photographers sufferedminor injuries when they were struck by flying stones.   An estimated 15,000 protesters assembled late Friday at CampCrame, headquarters of the Philippine Constabulary, the militarynational police. The crowd had dwindled to a few thousand when theconfrontation began.   Demonstrators moved to Camp Crame after a day-long rally Fridayby more than 25,000 people capping a 250-mile march by Marcossupporters from Ilocos Norte, his native province, that took 11days.   It was the largest show of support for Marcos since 1986 andoccurred on the eve of Mrs. Aquino's departure for Canada and theUnited States, where she hopes to convince businessmen thePhilippines is a stable place to invest.   Vice President Salvador Laurel told reporters at the rally thatMrs. Aquino's refusal to allow Marcos to be buried in thePhilippines was the ``worst mistake'' of her administration.   Marcos had lived in Hawaii since a civilian-military uprisingdrove him from office. Mrs. Aquino has refused, on nationalsecurity grounds, to allow the return of his body or of his widowImelda and their three children.   During the rally, the crowd cheered wildly when Laurel asked:``Do you agree that Marcos' body must be allowed home?''   ``It is now very clear what the people want,'' he declared.``You are a very powerful force. The government must follow thepeoples' will. If not, you know what to do.''   Police gave permission for the rally to be held at a trafficcircle in suburban Quezon City, but refused to let the protestersmarch to military garrisons.   After the rally, marchers defied the order and headed towardCamp Crame, across a major highway from armed forces headquartersand the Defense Department.   About 200 police blocked the street leading to the camp, butprotesters pushed through police lines and swarmed around the gates.   Reporters saw some riot police raising fingers in the ``V''sign, symbol of the Marcos movement. Marcos supporters chanted``Thank you! Thank you!'' to the officers.   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, chief of the Manila regional defensecommand, agreed to let the protesters remain there until midnight.   Laurel and leaders of the New Society Movement, the Marcospolitical party, later negotiated a formal agreement with Biazonand Local Governments Secretary Luis Santos to let the protestersstay until 5:30 a.m.   In a statement broadcast by pro-Marcos radio station DZEC, thelate president's son, Ferdinand Jr., said the demonstration was areaction to the ``arrogance of the Aquino administration.''   ``I congratulate the marchers for their steadfast and courageousactions,'' the statement said. ``You show to the world although weare a moderate, patient people, we Filipinos will not compromiseprinciples.''   Camp Crame was the scene last week of protests by Constabularytroopers angered by government plans to replace the militarynational police with a civilian force.   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, commander of the PhilippineConstabulary, claimed opposition groups were recruiting troopersfor a new coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino.   The military went on full alert Tuesday and is to remain in astate of heightened readiness until she returns Nov. 13 from visitsto Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, New York, Dallas and Los Angeles.   Several coups have been attempted since Mrs. Aquino took office,but none has occurred during her frequent trips abroad.   Aides said Mrs. Aquino would seek increased investment, tradeand relief from the country's $28 billion foreign debt on the tripto Canada and the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
