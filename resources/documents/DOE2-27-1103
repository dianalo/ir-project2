<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-27-1103 </DOCNO><TEXT>The change of the crossing parameter (essentially the phase) between sequentialslow separatrix crossings is calculated for Hamiltonian systems withone degree of freedom. Combined with the previous separatrix crossinganalysis, these results reduce the dynamics of adiabatic systems withseparatrices to a map. This map determines whether a trajectory leavinga given separatrix lobe is ultimately captured by the other lobe. Averagingthese results over initial phase yields the reaction probability, whichdoes not asymptote to the fully phase-mixed result even for arbitrarilylong times between separatrix crossings.</TEXT></DOC>
