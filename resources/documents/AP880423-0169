(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Patty Nowakowski says she agreed to be asurrogate mother and gave birth to a boy and a girl, only to findthat the couple wanted just the girl.   Now the twins, not yet 3 weeks old, live separately because thecouple who hired her didn't want the boy. After some hesitation,she and her husband, Aaron, have decided to raise the boythemselves and have named him Arthur Jay.   Nowakowski, 27, told her story this week to a speciallegislative panel looking into surrogacy contracts.   ``I was not aware of how carelessly the program is run,'' thewoman said. ``When I entered into it, I thought it would be awonderful thing to do for someone else, to help them have a family.I never dreamed it would turn out this way.''   The babies were born under a $10,000 contract arranged by NoelKeane, a Dearborn attrney who specializes in surrogate birthagreements. Keane arranged Mary Beth Whitehead's surrogatepregnancy, which resulted in a protracted legal battle in NewJersey known as the ``Baby M'' case.   Keane said he did not know of a couple ever having rejected asurrogate baby because of its sex, and would not discuss thespecifics of the Nowakowski contract.   Nowakowski was given fertility drugs and became pregnant at thefirst artificial insemination last July.   She said she learned she was carrying twins, and underwent aprocedure to determine the sex of the babies. The test showed thatone baby was a boy, but the sex of the other could not bedetermined.   Two weeks before the twins were born, the other couple, whoalready had children, told her a doctor had recommended againstadding more children to their family because of the added stress.   ``They had decided they did not want the boy,'' Nowakowski saidin an interview Thursday with The Grand Rapids Press. But thecouple told her that if the other baby was a girl, they would takeher.   ``At that point, I did not know what to do. I was very angry,''Nowakowski said. ``It put us in a bad position.''   Nowakowski said she and her husband, who have three otherchildren, thought they would put up the babies for adoption if theywere both boys. When the babies were born in a Lansing hospital,the couple came and took the baby girl. The boy was sent to afoster home.   But that bothered Nowakowski, and she and her husband ended uptaking Arthur Jay home.   ``It didn't seem fair to him, that he was rejected by hisbiological father, then rejected again by his surrogate parents.How can you make a child enter the world as a product ofrejection?''</TEXT></DOC>
