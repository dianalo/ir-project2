Sterie Beza of the United States was expected to arrive today totake over as head of an IMF team examining Brazil's economy. He will replaceArgentina's Jose Fajgembaum, who was quoted Friday in the Rio daily Jornal doBrasil as saying Brazil must reform trade and tax laws if it hoped to reach along-term agreement with the fund. Collor accused Fajgembaum of meddling inBrazil's affairs. Some analysts said the incident could make it harder for thetwo sides to agree on a $2 billion standby loan.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  General News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MONETARY FUND NAMES NEW CHIEF FOR BRAZIL  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Foreign News in Brief  </MEMO><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910725  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  120  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday July 25, 199100207128,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
