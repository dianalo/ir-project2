After weeks of deliberations, House and Senate aides saidlawmakers agreed that the final version of the $291 billionfiscal 1992 defense authorization bill will include $3.3billion to complete construction and testing of the 15bombers already in the pipeline and to keep Northrop Corp.'sassembly line open.</LP><TEXT>   Although B-2 supporters managed to set aside another $1billion for possible construction of a single new B-2, thefinal language imposes tougher hurdles than ever before onspending that money. Specifically, congressional aides saidthat yesterday's agreement specifies that no new B-2s may bepurchased in the fiscal year ending next Sept. 30 until afterthe plane passes rigorous flight tests and the House andSenate specifically vote on the issue again. The House andSenate Armed Services committees are expected to releasedetails of the final bill today.   The Pentagon requested a total of $4.8 billion in B-2funding. Barely a few weeks ago, Pentagon officials and B-2supporters in the Senate predicted that the final bill wouldinclude money to purchase as many as three new B-2s withoutmany strings attached. Since then, however, questions aboutthe plane's cost and stealthiness have eroded support for itamong senators.   While President Bush has threatened to veto any defensebill that doesn't include money for new B-2s, someadministration officials yesterday indicated that the latestHouse-Senate agreement probably will be acceptable to theWhite House.   According to lawmakers and aides, highlights of the finalauthorization bill include:   -- More than $4.1 billion for a group of anti-missileresearch programs called the Strategic Defense Initiative,another of Mr. Bush's top defense priorities. The Pentagonrequested more than $5 billion for such programs, but theHouse earlier this year approved less than $3.5 billion.   -- $1 billion for humanitarian aide to the Soviet Union.But the bill leaves it up to the Bush administration whetherto actually spend the money.   -- More than $400 million to purchase additional F-117stealth fighters built by Lockheed Corp. But under pressurefrom the House members, the agreement also includes money fornew General Dynamics Corp. F-16 jets the Air Force haslobbied for instead.</TEXT></DOC>
