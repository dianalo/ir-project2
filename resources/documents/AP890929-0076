In Cape Town, a prosecutor said two white police riot squadmembers will be charged with assaulting anti-apartheid protestersas a result of allegations of brutality made by a dissidentmixed-race officer.   The Justice Department said Mangena Jeffrey Boesman, 36, washanged along with a mixed-race man sentenced in a separate killing.   Boesman, a black member of the outlawed African NationalCongress guerrilla movement, was convicted of the 1985 killing ofMellina Fass, a black teacher who apparently defied a schoolboycott called by anti-apartheid activists.   Mrs. Fass, who was in her 50s, had a gasoline-soaked tire placedaround her neck and set alight.   In nationwide unrest from 1984 to 1986, militant anti-apartheidactivists used the ``necklace'' to kill dozens of people theyconsidered collaborators with the white government.   The U.N. General Assembly, by a vote of 149-0 Thursday, calledon South Africa to commute the death sentence of Boesman and allother ``political prisoners.''   The United States and Britain abstained. U.S. Ambassador ThomasR. Pickering said Washington did not consider Boesman a politicalprisoner.   ``There can be no circumstances in which a violent murder suchas the one in this case ... could be considered a rightfulpolitical act,'' said Pickering.   The South African Lawyers for Human Rights, who oppose the deathpenalty, said they made unsuccessful appeals to the governmentThursday on behalf of Boesman and the man executed alongside him,Jacobus Freeman.   Thirty-nine people have been executed in South Africa this year,far fewer than in recent years when more than 100 people werehanged annually. More than 200 people, mostly black men, remain ondeath row.   About 40 prisoners have had their death sentences commuted thisyear and now are serving prison terms.   In the police case, Neil Rossouw, attorney general for the CapeTown region, said Maj. Charles Brazelle and Lt. D.J. Ross wouldappear in court Tuesday to plead to assault charges stemming from aSept. 5 confrontation between police and activists in themixed-race township of Mitchell's Plain.   Rossouw said Thursday he decided to prosecute afterinvestigating complaints by Lt. Gregory Rockman, who accused riotsquad members of acting like ``wild dogs'' and beating and whippingprotesters and bystanders.   Rockman went public with his allegations Sept. 6, the day ofsegregated parliamentary elections that excluded the black majority.   He has become a folk hero with many township youths, whosometimes chant his name at anti-government rallies.   Activists say 23 people were killed in election day violenceinstigated by police in black and mixed-race townships outside CapeTown.   Police initially denied responsibility for any deaths. However,they have opened an investigation and now say 19 people werekilled, including 10 who died in black-on-black factional fightingand nine in incidents where police may have been involved.   Rockman said he welcomed the decision to prosecute but calledfor a broader investigation into alleged police brutality. He saidthe Sept. 5 violence was ``only one of the complaints that I'vegot.''   Rockman, who met with Roussouw Thursday, has called for theresignation of Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and requested ameeting with President F.W. de Klerk.</TEXT></DOC>
