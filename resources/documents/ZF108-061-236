 BUt she's not worried.andO;She knows she can access an on-line database either at the company library orat her desk, using a modem and her PC.andM;Since her company uses one of the larger on-line database vendors, she knowsshe can get everything from the most technical information (just released ata scientific conference) to agricultural statistics, commodities marketinformation and that article in a year-old edition of a national newsmagazine about the popularity of tofu.andM;What's On-Line?andM;What's available through on-line databases?andP;  The information available variesfrom vendor to vendor, but in most cases you can find anything you wouldexpect to find in a well stocked library, and in many cases much more.andM;For example, Dialog, one of the major vendors, has a 96-page catalog ofavailable databases.andP;  They range from the highly technical (EuropeanDirectory of Agrochemical Products) to the financial (Merger and AcquisitionFilings) to information for everyman (Marquis Who's Who, Peterson's CollegeDatabase and yes, Everyman's Encyclopedia).andM;In a 1988 study, Market Intelligence Research Company (MIRC) outlined threebasic types of information available on line: bibliographic, numeric andfull-text.andP;  Bibliographic databases contain citations, abstracts andannotated versions of publications.andM;Numeric databases contain current information about stocks, bonds, interestrates, securities and the like.andP;  They are monitored for immediate use ratherthan for research purposes.andP;  Full-text databases contain the publication orreport in its entirety.andM;On-line database vendors also provide a host of other services as well.andO;Travel services like American Airlines' EAAst Saber, on-line games,electronic mail and bulletin board services are available from many of theseproviders.andP;  One database vendor even has shop-at-home services from majordepartment stores.andM;Who's Doing It?andM;MIRC predicts that on-line database use is going to migrate from the officeto the home as people get used to the service's benefits and decide they justcan't live without them.andM;At least on vendor, Prodigy, is banking on this trend.andP;  Prodigy has tailoredits database for the at-home user.andP;  It has information like weather, stockquotes and an on-line version of Consumer Reports.andP;  Services include bankingand shopping as well as games and other entertainment.andM;They predict that as today's short-on-time two-career family grows moreaffluent there will be a great demand for the type of timesaving servicesavailable through the Prodigy service and other on-line databases.andM;How Does It Work?andM;There are usually three parties involved when an on-line database is used.andO;First is the user.andP;  Second is the vendor or service provider whose mainframecomputer stores the actual database.andP;  Third is the publisher or informationprovider who prepares the information in the database.andP;  Sometimes a vendormay prepare a database on their own, performing both the service provider andinformation provider functions, but usually there are two separate companiesinvolved.andM;The information provider or publisher may taken an existing publication andprepare an abstract, citation or full-text version of it for the database.andO;The database is loaded on tape and sent to the vendor where it is loaded onthe computer.andP;  Updates to the database are also sent to the vendor on tape.andM;In certain situations, such as databases that are updated frequently or inreal-time, the publisher will have a direct electronic link to the vendor toprovide updates.andM;A gateway is another possibility.andP;  When a vendor provides a gateway it passesthe user along directly to the information providers' computers.andP;  AmericanAirline's EASsy Saber is an example of a service that is accessed through agateway.andM;Katherine Mulvey of Dialog says that when the vendor itself provides adatabase it is usually a support database.andP;  She gives Dialog's on-linenewsletter as an example of the kind of database a vendor might provide.andM;The role of the vendor is to provide convenience to the user, says Mulvey.andO;They allow users to use the same search techniques for any database theyprovide no matter who supplied the information.andP;  Vendors also provideproprietary software that makes accessing the database easier.andM;Mulvey reports that Dialog can be accessed with any good communicationssoftware with a break function.andP;  Their DialogLink software for IBM-PCs andcompatibles makes working with the databases just a little bit easier -- andlets users access the images that are available with some databases.andM;&quot;Accessing an on-line database takes only a local phone call for mostpeople,&quot; Mulvey says.andP;  That local call gives you access to a dedicated dataline.andP;  For many of the big vendors, that line is part of their proprietarynetwork.andP;  CompuServe has its own network, Dialog has DialNet and Mead DataCentral has Meadnet.andP;  Where these networks are not available other digitalnetworks like Tymnet or Telenet are used.andM;&quot;The network gives you a clean line,&quot; says Mulvey, and it links you directlywith the vendor's computers.andM;CompuServe's Kitty Munger Thomas uses her own company as an example of whathappens when you access a database.andP;  &quot;First you are prompted for a user IDand password.andP;  Then you see a message welcoming you to CompuServe InfoService, the time and date and the last time you logged on.andM;&quot;Then you see the &quot;What's New This Week&quot; menu, which is updated each week.andO;This week 11 stories are listed, including an announcement of a healthdatabase service and a change in customer service hours.&quot;andM;Next, the CompuServe &quot;top&quot; menu is displayed.andP;  This gives you a listing ofavailable topics including Communications, Reference, News, Weather, Sportsand the Electronic Mall (a shopping service).andM;There is a section called &quot;Find A Topic&quot; that lets you bypass the menus.andO;Just type in &quot;find,&quot; then the topic you want.andP;  &quot;For example,&quot; says Thomas,&quot;typing 'find stocks' will get you the stock tables.&quot;andP;  You can also getaround by choosing item numbers, the &quot;Go&quot; command or by following the menus.andM;Some of the products have search capability, says Thomas, but not all of themdo.andP;  &quot;Searching&quot; an on-line database lets you find every occurrence of a wordor phrase in a given publication, report or group of publications andreports.andP;  She points out that some of CompuServe's most popular services aretheir Electronic Mail and Forum bulletin boards which don't use the searchcapability.andM;CostandM;There are a number of costs involved in using an on-line database.andP;  First,there may be a charge for the vendor's proprietary software.andP;  This charge isusually small and may include instruction and some free connect-time.andP;  Next,there is a monthly subscription charge.andM;Then, each time you use the service you are charged per hour for connect time(for Mead Data Central's Nexis it's $20), per hour for using the data network($8 for Meadnet), per search depending on the databases used ($3 to $21 onNexis) and sometimes a per line charge for displaying what you have found onscreen and another rate for printing a hard-copy (usually a few cents or afraction of a cent per line).andM;One vendor that does not charge by connect-time is Prodigy.andP;  They charge aflat monthly fee of $9.95 which covers all charges.andP;  The Prodigy serviceincludes advertisements to offset costs.andM;The FutureandM;The future for on-line database looks bright.andP;  MIRC predicts there will be990,884 on-line databasse subscribers in 1990, a growth rate of 21.9% from1989.andP;  They expect revenues to increase by 24.3% in 1990, to $5.27 billion.andM;MIRC says there are three major trends that will affect the on-line databasemarket: CD-ROM; the education of end-users by vendors and info providers; andthe growth of the at-home market.andM;The CD-ROM, which stores large amounts of read-only information on a compactdisk, in many cases will be in direct competition with the on-line database.andO;MIRC believes that in time both technologies will coexist, each being usedfor the applications it best serves.andM;Legal database vendors have been successful teaching law school students howto use their databases -- and getting them hooked on the ease of on-lineresearch.andP;  MIRC predicts that this type of education will be applied to otherprofessions and educational levels to introduce more potential users to thetechnology.andM;MIRC also points to the growth of the personal computer industry, lowerdatabase costs and an increase of consumer-oriented information as factors inthe growth of at-home users of on-line databases.andP;  The recent trend towardat-home offices, complete with PC, fax machine and photocopier seems tosupport this prediction.andM;But all of these rest on the basic fact that people who use on-line databasesfind them helpful.andP;  On-line databases allow their users to save time whileincreasing knowledge.andP;  If you have superior information and you have itbefore the competition you have all but won the race.andP;  Like other officetools, on-line databases help people get ahead.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
