The largest sale was by Dr. Rudolph Nisi, chairman of theLos Angeles-based pharmaceutical research firm. He sold75,000 shares June 27 and 29 for a total $928,750, or $12.38a share. The shares represented 34% of his stake in thecompany, according to SEC filings.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, Medco's president, Manfred Mosk, has filed withthe SEC his intention to sell 40,000 shares, or 12% of hisholdings in the company, valued at $560,000.   The sales come at a time when Medco Research stock hasbeen buoyed by hopes for Federal Drug Administration approvalof the company's Adenoscan heart drug, takeover rumors and apositive article in Business Week magazine. Medco's sharesclosed yesterday at $14.125 bid in over-the-counter trading,at the higher end of its 52-week trading range of $6.88 to$20.25.   Neither Mr. Mosk nor Mr. Nisi could be reached forcomment, but Sanford Hillsberg, a director and one of Medco'stwo vice presidents, said, &quot;I don't view this as a bailout,but orderly liquidation.&quot;   Mr. Hillsberg, one of the three insider-sellers, sold45,000 shares in several sales in June, shares representing19% of his holdings, SEC filings show. &quot;I've never been morebullish on the company, but, on the other hand, if you haveall your eggs in one basket, it may be prudent to diversify,&quot;he said. He added that he chose last month to sell the sharesbecause he plans to exercise options to buy more Medco stockin December. Under SEC rules, he wouldn't be able to sellshares six months before and after an options exercise.   Hemant K. Shaw, analyst with HKS andamp; Co., Warren, N.J., saidthe company has generally been popular with the medicalcommunity because of the prospects for its cardiac drug. ButMedco hasn't been as popular with investors, he said, chieflybecause the company has never been in the black. Mr. Shaw,who said he once worked as a consultant to Medco, recommendsthe stock because of the likely success of Adenoscan.   The third insider-seller, Medco's former head of research,William C. Govier, sold 15,000 shares between June 4 and 8 atan average price of $14.22 each, or a total of $213,300. Heretains 88,628 shares, SEC filings show. The companydismissed Mr. Govier in May, but he is considered an insiderby the SEC for filing purposes because of his large stake inthe firm. Mr. Govier couldn't be reached for comment.                                                                                                          LOWER EXPECTATIONS: Eight insiders at Lowe's Cos. sold$1.5 million of stock in May and June, SEC filings show. Theinsiders trimmed their holdings in the North Wilkesboro,N.C., building-materials company by a total of 32,293 shares,according to SEC filings. For four insiders, who each soldless than 1,000 shares, the sales liquidated their entireholdings in the company.   The sales took place from May 18 through June 13 at anaverage price of $45.11. Lowe's share price has since fallensharply. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, thestock closed yesterday at $34.875, down 25 cents.   According to W. Cliff Oxford, spokesman for the company,an exceptionally strong 20% sales gain in the first quarter,which ended in April, led to unreal expectations by bothanalysts and stockholders. While sales in the current quarterare running 11% ahead the year-earlier period, he said, thatwon't be enough to meet analysts' earnings expectations, anda &quot;nervous&quot; market has penalized the company. He added thatthe insider selling was part of the &quot;normal course ofbusiness.&quot;   The largest sale was by Pietro Kulnych, a director. SECfilings show he sold 12,000 shares in May, 3% of hisholdings. (Mr. Kulnych has since sold another 3,000 shares,the company said, that aren't yet reflected in the SECfiles.) Mr. Kulnych couldn't be reached for comment.   Company president Leonard B. Herring sold 10,000 shares at$48.25 a share on June 1, SEC filings show. The salerepresented 2% of his holdings. Mr. Herring declined tocomment.                                                                                                          CASHING OUT: In one of the larger insider sales of stockreported to the SEC last week, Jack R. Daugherty, chairman ofCash America Investments Inc., a Fort Worth, Texas, owner andoperator of pawnshops, sold 20% of his stake. He received$1.1 million for the 65,000 shares, which were sold inseveral sales in June, the filings show.   Mr. Daugherty declined to comment, but a spokeswoman saidhe sold &quot;for personal reasons.&quot; Mr. Daugherty's sharesfetched an average price of $17.65. On the American StockExchange yesterday, Cash America shares closed at $17.25,unchanged.   ---   Anne Newman contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
