OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said a panel of eight ministersof the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries renewed theirintention to ``adhere very strictly'' in the April-June quarter toa November pact to slash production.   The meeting was the organization's first formal review of theoil market since the accord, which covers the first six months ofthe year.   The ministers addressed tactics for maintaining the surprisingstrength of the current market. There had been indications someministers ministers wanted to raise the production cap to keep oilprices from rising too fast.   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said, ``Everything isgoing very well. ... Everybody is satisfied with the current marketstability.''   Diego Tamariz, the Ecuadoran oil minister attending the talks asan observer, said the discussions centered on the market situationand long-term strategy.   Since the cartel agreed in November to slash production in thefirst half of this year, prices have rallied, unexpectedly reachingthis week the OPEC benchmark of $18 a barrel.   With firming prices, the ministers were already beginning toturn their attention to the output accord that will be hammered outin early June to cover the last half of the year.   The November arrangement called for the countries to limit theirproduction to a total of 18.5 million barrels a day, well under thelevel of last last year. It also set the target price of $18 abarrel.   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by thecartel reached $18.01 a barrel Tuesday. The price is up more than$5 a barrel since November.   The May contract price for West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark U.S. crude, was up 39 cents in early trading today to$20.59 cents a 42-gallon barrel after rising 29 cents Wednesday onthe New York Mercantile Exchange.   The price, the highest for the near-term contract since August1987, was lifted partly by concern about the oil tanker spill offAlaska on Friday.   Prices for West Texas Intermediate and North Sea Brent blend,the most widely traded international crudes, have climbed more thanthe Middle Eastern crudes offered by the OPEC countries.   The price surge has been linked to the reduction in OPECproduction as well as unforeseen accidents in producing regionsthat have clipped supply. Demand also has been stronger thanforecast.   Subroto said the monitoring committee would meet ``severaltimes, many times'' before the June meeeting.   Sabah indicated in a recent interview with the Middle EastEconomic Survey that he would like the daily output cap lifted to20 million barrels in the last six months of the year.   Asked Wednesday about the interview, he said, ``It is myposition, but we are reasonable people. We have to look at supplyand demand and decide on that basis. We're going to look at thefigures and then decide in June.''   Other ministers have been more cautious about urging changes inthe accord. Several have insisted that the cartel must wait to seehow the market acts in the April-June quarter, when pricesgenerally weaken as demand slips with the coming of warmer weatherin oil importing nations.   Indepednent oil exporting nations, including the Soviet Union,have agreed to help OPEC in the second quarter by trimming theirexports to a total of about 300,000 barrels a day.   Members of the monitoring committee are Algeria, Indonesia,Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.   Other OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar and theUnited Arab Emirates.</TEXT></DOC>
