Procedures are described forestimating masses of nuclei with N{ge}Z from the most general solutionof this difference equation subject to a chi{sup 2} minimization, usingthe recent atomic mass adjustment of Wapstra, Audi, and Hoekstra as aboundary condition. A judicious division of the input data in subsetsof neutron-rich and proton-rich nuclei had to be introduced to reducesystematic errors in long-range extrapolations. Approximately 5600 mass-excessvalues for nuclei with 2{le}Z{le}103, 4{le}N{le}157, and N{ge}Z (exceptN = Z odd for Aandless;40) have been calculated. The standard deviation forreproducing the known mass-excess values is {sigma}/sub m/{approx_equal}103keV.</TEXT></DOC>
