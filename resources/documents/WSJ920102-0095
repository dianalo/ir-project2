In court papers filed this week, the Office of ThriftSupervision disclosed that the thrift office issued asubpoena to Ernst andamp; Young last June, seeking work documentsinvolving 23 failed Sandamp;Ls that the Big Six firm advised oraudited. The thrifts include Lincoln Savings andamp; LoanAssociation, whose former chief, Charles Keating, wasconvicted recently of securities fraud in California; andSilverado Banking Savings andamp; Loan Association, one of whosedirectors was Neil Bush, the president's son.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The purpose of the investigation is to determine whetherErnst andamp; Young has participated in the violation of OTS rulesand regulations in connection with services it provided tothe 23 institutions designated in the subpoena,&quot; said theagency's filing in federal court here.   In June, Ernst andamp; Young filed a motion with the thriftoffice to quash the subpoena, which was denied. Since then,the firm has provided no documents, the thrift office said,and this week's court action sought to enforce the subpoena.If the investigation concludes that the firm violated therules, the OTS could file a civil suit against the firm.   Ernst andamp; Young said it plans to continue to fight thesubpoena. &quot;We believe the subpoena is invalid for a number ofreasons, and we plan to file a response,&quot; a spokesman forErnst andamp; Young said. Privately, at least one Ernst officialcontended that the OTS lacks jurisdiction, and that theissues involving the Sandamp;Ls were subject to a separate legalsettlement with the Resolution Trust Corp.   Last year, Ernst andamp; Young and the RTC agreed to settle anRTC suit for roughly $41 million over Ernst andamp; Young's role inthe failure of Lincoln Savings. The RTC disposes of failedSandamp;Ls and their assets, while the OTS regulates Sandamp;Ls.   The Securities and Exchange Commission separately hasfiled suit against several Ernst andamp; Young partners, allegingthat they borrowed from Republicbank Corp., a former Texasbanking company, while an audit was under way.</TEXT></DOC>
