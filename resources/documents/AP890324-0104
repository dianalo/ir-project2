Until that happens, there is little hope for fruitfulnegotiations on the nation's future, Mrs. Thatcher said in aninterview with the BBC's Africa service to be broadcast Saturday.   She is visiting Africa next week, but South Africa is not on theitinerary that includes Morocco, Nigeria, Malawi, and Zimbabwe.   ``I have made it quite clear that I could not go until somethingquite positive happens and Mr. Mandela is released,'' Mrs. Thatchersaid.   ``I think that there are chances of things improving enormouslyin South Africa once Mr. Mandela is released. It opens the way fornegotiations to start. But I could not go just at the moment untilthere are more signs of that happening.''   Asked what was the next likely stage of developments in SouthAfrica, she replied: ``I have indicated that if Mr. Mandela isreleased I think that negotiations would become possible with someof the other many leaders of black South Africans. Obviously theyare not a homogenous people any more than we are in Europe.''   She doubted it would be possible for tribal leaders to negotiateuntil Mandela was released.   At the same time, she said she could not consider meeting withthe African National Congress that Mandela leads until the guerrillaorganization renounced violence.   ``I think the government of South Africa would like arenunciation of violence. We did not quite get that, and I do nottalk to those who in fact pursue their ends by violent means.''   She continued: ``Look, we are trying to get a way through bysaying that Mr. Mandela should be released and should be free. Thisis part of the bargain, he should be free in fact to put his ownview but not ... free to exercise violence.   ``One tries to get a law-abiding country. Violence is anarchy.The rule of the gun and rule by force is not something I've had anysympathy with at all.''   Asked if she believed in one man, one vote in South Africa, Mrs.Thatcher said: ``I think you will have to have one person, one vote.That does not necessarily mean a unitary state.   ``They will have to work it out.''   Mrs. Thatcher's comments do not represent a new approach. ``She'ssaid this for a long time now,'' an aide said.   Mrs. Thatcher argues a moderate stance toward South Africa canachieve more than advocating sanctions, which she argues would hurtthe country's black majority more than the white-run government, andwould devastate economies of nearby black-ruled states that dependon South Africa's transport network to import and export goods.</TEXT></DOC>
