Super Calc 5; and thejust-announced Quattro Pro--have jointly proved the value of multipagemodeling and have made three-dimensionality an essential feature oftop-flight spreadsheet programs.andM;One little gun that has been focusing on three-dimensionality for some timeis FormalSoft, an erstwhile shareware firm.andP;  In the February 16, 1988, issueof PC Magazine, FormalSoft's QubeCalc, a 64-by-64-by-64 shareware worksheetwith some unusual data-slicing features, was awareded an Editor's Choicedesignation ina roundup of low-end spreadsheet programs (&quot;Spreadsheets forModest Proposals&quot;).andP;  Now, with ProQube, the company has plunged boldly intothe mainstream spreadsheet market.andM;Priced at $247.50, ProQube is a completely rewritten superset of QubeCalc.andO;FormalSoft has expanded the dimensions to 512 rows by 512 colums by 512pages, has beefed up the macro facilities, and has added a graphing module(from Media Cybernetics) in the form of a detachable TSR.andP;  The new product'sclaim to fame, however, is a set of View commands that instantly transposeand reorient three-dimensional data.andM;Picture a worksheet that tracks expense figures by time period for each ofseveral company divisions.andP;  The expense categories are in rows and theperiods in columns, and each page of the file has been supplied by aparticular division manager.andP;  With a simple ProQube View command, you caninstantly rearrange this information so that divisions are in columns andeach page covers a particular quarter.andP;  A different View command lets youflip the structure, placing the divisions in rows and the time periods incolumns and devoting each page to a single expense category.andM;Accomplishing these rearrangements in most spreadsheet programs would be anerror-prone process requiring extensive use of transposition commands.andP;  Formany users, it would be more trouble than it's worth.andP;  But with ProQube, therearranging is effortless and error-free.andM;ProQube invites you to think of your three-dimensional data as a sort ofRubik's Cube.andP;  When you begin working with a model, you are said to belooking at the front face of the cube.andP;  The View Right and View Top commandsrotate the cube 90 degrees, giving you the two transpositions describedabove.andM;The metaphor comes apart, however, when you ask to see the back, left, orbottom of the cube.andP;  Strictly speaking, the back face should have the samelayout as the front, but with the left-right order of the columns reversed.andO;Instead, ProQube's back face shows your data paged in the same way as itsfront face, but with the row data displayed in columns and vice versa.andP;  Theleft and bottom faces offer similarly shuffled versions of the right and topfaces.andM;Two other ProQube attractions are worth singling out.andP;  The first is apage-look-up function, which lets you create an array of look-up tables witheach table on its own page.andP;  The function uses the upper-left-corner cell ofeach page as an index value and accepts both column and row offset arguments.andO;This function has no direct counterpart in most other spreadsheet programs;it is handy for applications, such as determining payroll deductions, thatrequire choosing among multiple tables before looking up values.andM;The second attraction is an unusually rich application tool kit.andP;  Macros,which reside in separate disk files, can be recorded as well as createdthrough to any keys (including the function keys in all shift states), andcan be triggered by events in the spreadsheet.andP;  Thus, you can have a certainmacro run only when the user enters an out-of-bounds value in a specifiedcell.andM;This feature, combined with macro statements specifically tailored for userassistance (verbs that plant text windows on-screen and/or create custom helpand error messages), gives the ProQube programmer a leg up in developingapplications for the novice user.andM;These strengths aside, however, ProQube is beset with limitations.andP;  Becausepages extend only to 512 rows, users will be unable to import deep modelscreated in other programs.andP;  (dBASE files with more than 512 records are splitacross pages on import, but deep 1-2-3 files are simply truncated.)andO;Compatibility with other programs is incomplete; 1-2-3 macros are nottranslated, and a number of commands and navigational keystrokes differ fromthe industry standards in arbitrary ways.andM;ProQube's graph module is slightly more advanced than that of 1-2-3, Release2.2 (it includes a high-low type option and some 3-D perspective choices),but not enough to matter.andP;  And there are no data-query commands at all.andO;ProQube's brute-force recalc times, moreover, compare unfavorably with thoseof other spreadsheet programs.andM;ProQube offers analytical perspective that are difficult to achieve in otherspreadsheets.andP;  This fact, combined with the package's relatively low listprice, may justify acquiring ProQube as an adjunct to more-versatileprograms, such as 1-2-3 or SuperCalc.andP;  But for routine number-tracking tasksthat don't require its multiple-perspective talents, ProQube comes up short.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
