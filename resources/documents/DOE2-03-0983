Thestudy goes into the problems encountered with the legal reservation withregard to licensing and plan approval decisions. The basic types of actionof the executive are subdivided according to intent, i.e. assigned tothe supervisory or the planning intents, and are examined for a possiblescope of discretion opened up for the administration. The decisive questionin this context is the scope of action that may be given to the administrationby the legislation, and to what extent such 'freedom' will stand theacceptance test by the courts.
