<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-85-0995 </DOCNO><TEXT>A CW dye laser has been developed and investigated which can emit bothsingle- and dual-frequency radiation with an output power of about 1W. A simple frequency stabilization scheme using an external passiveFabry-Perot etalon has been implemented. The laser emission frequencydrift did not exceed 3 MHz/h. Electronic discrete-smooth frequency tuningwithin a band of 200 GHz was achieved through the use of galvanometersfor the rotation of the intracavity Fabry-Perot etalons. 16 references.</TEXT></DOC>
