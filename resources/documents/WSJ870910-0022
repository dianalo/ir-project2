Testifying before a Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee, New York lawyer Martin Pollner, the attorney for the scandal-plagued Bronx, N.Y., company currently in bankruptcy-law proceedings, disclosed that such profits were larger than previously indicated.    Mr. Pollner spelled out, for the first time, details of money received by Mr. Nofziger and James Jenkins, who are both former White House aides. The accounting also included lobbyist Mark Bragg, a business partner of Mr. Nofziger, and attorney Robert Wallach, a longtime friend of Attorney General Edwin Meese.    Testimony and documents released yesterday don't provide new information about Mr. Meese's dealings with Wedtech or its officials, which are under investigation by an independent prosecutor.    Mr. Pollner told the subcommittee that executives, lobbyists and consultants for the company, including Mr. Nofziger, &quot;unloaded&quot; approximately $10 million of Wedtech stock shortly before the company was disqualified from lucrative Small Business Administration contracts in 1986.    Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.), the subcommittee chairman, said the panel has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate whether the transactions may have violated insider-trading laws. Paul Perito, Mr. Nofziger's attorney, said any allegations of insider-trading violations are &quot;without a factual or legal basis&quot; and that the issue has been &quot;exhaustively reviewed&quot; by the independent prosecutor and found to be without merit.    Messrs. Jenkins, Bragg, and Wallach couldn't be reached for comment.    Overall, Mr. Pollner told the subcommittee that Wedtech's former management &quot;was cashing in to an astonishing extent&quot; on the company's federal contracts and public stock offerings. From 1983 to 1986, according to Mr. Pollner, management and other insiders received more than $24 million from the sale of Wedtech stock. And a &quot;large portion of those sales,&quot; he asserted, took place &quot;long after the time the company became insolvent.&quot;    The SBA's decision to remove Wedtech from federal contracts set aside for minority businesses sent the company's stock plummeting. Three separate federal grand juries are investigating the machine-making company's operations, more than 16 people have been indicted or pleaded guilty as a result of those inquiries, and additional charges are expected.    The subcommittee released the text of an undated memo, written after Mr. Nofziger left the government in January 1982, in which the former White House political director told Mr. Jenkins, a top aide to then-White House counselor Mr. Meese, that it was &quot;imperative&quot; for Wedtech to complete negotiations for an Army engine contract. In the memo Mr. Nofziger sought Mr. Jenkins's help in securing a letter of intent for a no-bid contract.    Mr. Nofziger has been indicted on charges of illegally lobbying Mr. Jenkins. Mr. Nofziger is contesting the charges and maintains he didn't violate any laws. </TEXT></DOC>
