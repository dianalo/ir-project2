Gen. Prosper Avril, making along-awaited address to this troubled nation, promised that hismilitary government would lay the foundation for democratic reformsbut offered no new policies.   Army officials, meanwhile, acknowledged for the first timeFriday that a military coup against Avril's fledgling regime hadbeen thwarted.   Avril's speech, broadcast to the nation on state television andradio, was the subject of widespread anticipation because it wasthe first by the new leader since he assumed power in a militarycoup one month ago.   But the speech lasted only 10 minutes and offered no new policyobjectives.   Avril emphasized that local elections should be held before thecountry could consider electing a new president.   He said Friday that he would propose that ``an independentelectoral council be established in the next few days to preparefor county, municipal and legislative elections ... to open the wayfor presidential elections in a serene atmosphere.''   Avril listed his government's objectives as creating jobs,fighting corruption, promoting investment and bringing an end toviolence.   ``The national interest demands that an end be put to theviolence and agitation which threaten national stability,'' he said.   Observers said they saw nothing new in Avril's remarks.   The new leader, who replaced ousted leader Lt. Gen. Henri Namphyin the Sept. 17 coup engineered by rank-and-file soldiers, did notmention a reported coup attempt against his government during theweekend that led to the arrest of 12 soldiers.   However, Defense and Interior Minister Col. Carl Dorsindilacknowledge the coup attempt Friday evening.   ``An attempted coup d' etat led by Sgt. Patrick Beauchard incollaboration with former Lt. Col. Samuel Jeremie was foiled,'' thecommunique read. ``The attempt was unmasked in time and certain oftheir accomplices were arrested.''   Earlier Friday, about 2,000 demonstrators marched from thecharred ruins of a slum church to protest a church order to expelan activist priest and called on the government to implement armyreforms.   The protesters, now in their second week of demonstrations, havebeen angered by the decision of the Roman Catholic Church'sSalesian Order to force the Rev. Jean Bertrand Aristide, Haiti'smost popular priest, to leave the country.   The demonstrators waved banners hailing Aristide as a``prophet'' and asked Avril to implement promised reforms,including bringing to justice any remaining Tonton Macoutes, thehated secret police that served the Duvalier regime for 29 years.   A massacre at Aristide's St. Jean Bosco church on Sept. 11 wascited by the rank-and-file soldiers as a reason for overthrowingNamphy. Thugs stormed the church during Mass, killed 12 people,wounded more than 70 others and burned down the building.   Aristide's Salesian Order superiors in Rome had ordered him toleave Haiti by Oct. 17. Friends of the priest said Aristide wasstill in Haiti on Friday and had not followed up on the transferorder to the St. Claire parish in Montreal, Canada.   Aristide advocates liberation theology, which encouragespolitical activism. The Haitian church hierarchy has accused thepriest of preaching violence and class struggle.</TEXT></DOC>
