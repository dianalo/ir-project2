Newly developed analyticalmethods for empirical force field determination make it possible to fillin the &quot;gaps&quot; which are always present in the existing experimental data.Also, there is never an experimental uncertainty, or an ambiguity ofvibrational frequency assignment to deal with. And, since so much &quot;experimentaldata&quot; can be generated, it is now possible to test various formulationsof model force fields and directly study the importance of various crossterms which are included by some investigators and ignored by others.Preliminary results for simple classes of molecules are presented. Allcalculations presented were performed with the aid of the SDSC SCS-40superminicomputer. Features of this new supermini are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
