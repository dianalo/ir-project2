Brock Adams is facing increasing pressure toresign.   After the allegations appeared Sunday in the SeattleTimes, Sen. Adams, a Democrat from Washington, deniedwrongdoing but said he wouldn't seek re-election in November.Nevertheless, a drumbeat for his resignation has continued.Just yesterday, the Tacoma News Tribune said he should eitherbegin to fight the charges vigorously or resign -- achallenge that followed calls from other newspapers and someof his own supporters for him to step down.</LP><TEXT>   In the nation's capital, however, politicians and women'sorganizations have been mostly silent. The women's groupshave long backed him politically because of his votingrecord, and Democratic politicians privately question whetherhis resignation might add more confusion to an alreadyvolatile race for his seat. Sen. Adams has said he intends tostay.   The Seattle Times story carried the accusations of eightwomen who weren't identified by name, but most of whom areknown in the state's political community. To add to theircredibility, most signed affidavits saying they woulddisclose their identities if their stories were challenged incourt. They accused the senator of misdeeds ranging from rapeto using drugs to make them more compliant with his sexualadvances.   In the face of these charges, even some of the senator'ssupporters have balked. Among those who have called for hisresignation are Judith Lonnquist, a Seattle attorney who is along-time Adams supporter and a member of his financecommittee.   &quot;I think he can no longer serve with distinction,&quot; Ms.Lonnquist said in an interview yesterday. &quot;It reflects veryseverely on his character, his credibility and hisintegrity.&quot;   Washington state newspapers have begun to editorializeagainst Sen. Adams. The Tacoma newspaper said, &quot;The senatorhas offered only evasions . . . and he depicted himself as avictim of a vague conspiracy. This won't do.&quot; On Tuesday, theBellevue Journal American called on Sen. Adams to resign,while the Spokane Spokesman-Review said, &quot;If Adams reallywants to serve women and all Washingtonians, a resignationwould be in order.&quot;   Karen Marchioro, head of the state Democratic party, saidthat state party leaders plan to discuss Sen. Adams's futureat a meeting this weekend in Ellensburg. &quot;There are people onboth sides of this issue,&quot; she said. &quot;Obviously, there's alot of concern.&quot;   In Washington, D.C., however, women's organizations aretorn about what to say about the accusations. Sen. Adams haslong been a defender of women's rights and women'slegislation. &quot;There is a certain bittersweet feeling in thewomen's community,&quot; said Harriett Woods, president of theNational Women's Political Caucus.   Whether the senator should resign &quot;is an issue that has tobe addressed by his constituents and his state party,&quot; sheasserted. But she added, &quot;From the viewpoint of exploitingwomen from a power position, very serious questions have beenraised and left hanging, and that's very disturbing.&quot;   The National Organization for Women is still consideringwhat to do. A NOW spokeswoman said, &quot;This issue is underadvisement, and our decision-making process has not reached aconclusion.&quot;   Republican opponents of Mr. Adams have been the mostoutspoken against him. Rep. Rod Chandler (R., Wash.), who waschallenging Sen. Adams for his Senate seat, has called forhim to resign. But most Democratic officials have beenreluctant to do the same, and there doesn't appear to be anymovement among his colleagues in the Senate to urge him toleave. Democrats note that if Mr. Adams were to resign morethan six months before the November elections, a specialelection would have to be held within 90 days, adding to theconfusion that already surrounds the election picture.</TEXT></DOC>
