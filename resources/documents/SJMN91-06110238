Santana suffered aheart attack in San Leandro while delivering a eulogy at the funeral of an oldfriend, Angelo Pandolfi.;    &quot;I lost two brothers,&quot; said a somber LouiePandolfi as he sat in the second row of the board chambers awaiting his secondmemorial of the week. Santana will be buried at 1:30 p.m. today at HolySepulchre Cemetery in Hayward.;    Fighting back tears, speakers encouragedSantana's friends to celebrate his life and follow his high-spirited examplerather than grieve too long over his departure.;    Still, Sheriff CharliePlummer said he'd miss Santana's trademark slap on the back and boominggreeting of &quot;Hey! My buddy!&quot;;    &quot;Charlie was spit on a hot stove -- he waseverywhere,&quot; Plummer said.;    &quot;Everywhere&quot; was shaking hands withconstituents through the windows of his car, hustling over to a Haywardalcohol treatment center to patch up a squabble with a neighbor or meeting thepope in the White House Rose Garden.;    And Santana was always  in the standsof the Coliseum when the A's were in town.;    &quot;He was the only season-ticketholder who purchased a year in advance,&quot; A's Vice President Andy Dolich toldan audience that knew, all too well, of Santana's incurable addiction tosports.;    But Santana's interest wasn't just on the play in the field. Oneof his closest friends -- and, by all accounts, he had plenty -- was AbeSouza, the peanut vendor. Earlier this month, Santana unveiled the muralenshrining the now-deceased Souza in the Coliseum's Hall of Fame.;    Gettingthat mural finished was a passion with Santana, Dolich said. &quot;I know thatpersonally because he called me every 15 minutes&quot; inquiring about the progressof the project.;    Santana's friends included senatorial hopefuls as well aspeanut sellers.;    Former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein came to speakof Santana's funny exploits as well as his unflagging work in her lastcampaign.;    &quot;There won't be many like him to follow,&quot; she said. &quot;If he was afriend, by God, he was a friend.&quot;;    If there was a common theme in thehourlong memorial, it was that Santana didn't distinguish between dignitariesand the downtrodden. All were included in his ever-expanding circle offamily.;    Lee Perez, a friend and aide, said he first met Santana when theformer Hayward councilman was elected a county supervisor in 1975. &quot;He was aswarm to me that day as the last day I talked to him.&quot;;    Perez said Santanaalso had a high-voltage temper. &quot;When he got angry, you got out of the way,&quot;he said. But the fury usually vanished, Perez said, as quickly as itappeared.;    &quot;His greatest joy was in his interaction with people,&quot; saidstate Sen. Nick Petris, an Oakland Democrat. &quot;He never forgot the people.&quot;;   Nor, speakers said, did Santana forget his roots.;    In a speech that wasstalled for several moments as he choked back tears, Petris recalled growingup in the same ethnically mixed West Oakland neighborhood as Santana. Familiesshared cultures as well as then-illegal home-brewed wines, Petris said.;   Most, he said, developed a deep patriotism that was evident in Santana's laterpolitical life.;    Santana brought himself national publicity several yearsago when he launched an all-out attack on Berkeley over that city's refusal topledge allegiance to the flag before city council meetings.;    &quot;He was intosymbols, he was into pictures,&quot; said county board President Mary King. Shegave Santana's wife, Doris, a neatly folded flag bearing the Alameda Countylogo that Santana helped design.;    King said she, too, hoped to keep alasting memory of Santana's life.;    Noting that the county faced a financialcrisis and soon would have to decide how to cut funds to needy socialprograms, the board president said, &quot;I'd like us to rededicate ourselves to bea little kinder to one another.;    &quot;Charlie was a man who knew no meanness.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ABBY COHN, Mercury News Oakland Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910419  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  866  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday April 19, 199100110238,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
