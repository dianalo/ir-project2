Introduction</ITAG>On January 27, 1989 (54 FR 4043), the Board, in Resolution No. 89-40, proposedto adopt a new short-form application to be used by insured institutionsto obtain approval of routine reorganizations involving the creation ofsavings and loan holding companies.\1\<NOTE/> Written comments were solicited by the Board with the commentperiod ending March 28, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Also on January 27, 1989, in Resolution No. 89-32, theBoard proposed certain amendments to its regulations to provide for theautomatic approval of such applications on an expedited basis providedthe proposed transaction satisfied certain specified conditions. Afterconsidering public comments on the proposed amendments, the Board adoptedfinal regulations at 12 CFR 574.7 (a)(2) and (a)(3) that provide for theautomatic approval of simple holding company reorganization applicationssubject to conditions substantially similar to those proposed by the Boardin January 1989.The Board invited commenters to address all aspects of the proposal, includingwhether certain information, documents, and certifications described inthe proposal should be required in the new short-form application or whethercertain individual items should be expanded, modified, or deleted in wholeor in part.The Board received a total of 3 comments in response to the proposal, allof which expressed support for the proposal. Of the comments received,two came from law firms that represent thrift institutions and one camefrom a national thrift trade organization. While each of the comments expressedsupport for the proposal, several suggested certain modifications in theinformation, documents, and certifications that should be required in thenew short-form application. After carefully considering the issues raisedby the commenters, the Board has determined to adopt the proposal withcertain modifications.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Routine Holding Company Reorganizations</ITAG>During the past several years, the Board's staff has processed and approveda large number of applications by insured institutions to reorganize intoholding company structures. As a result of its experience with simple reorganizationapplications, the Board is aware that such transactions usually do notpresent unusual structural issues or raise significant law or policy concerns.The reorganization is almost always accomplished through a reverse triangularmerger transaction whereby an interim institution chartered under federalor state law is merged into the insured institution and each share of stockof the insured institution is exchanged for one share of stock of the newholding company.\2\<NOTE/> Furthermore, the new holding company engages in no operationsprior to consummation of the reorganization, and its only significant assetimmediately after the transaction is its investment in the insured institutionsubsidiary. Shareholders of the insured institution generally have theopportunity to vote to approve or disapprove the reorganization and canexercise dissenters' rights of appraisal under applicable law if they donot vote in favor of the reorganization.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The shares of the new holding company issued to the formershareholders of the insured institution generally must be registered withthe Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') under the Securities Actof 1933, as amended. Nevertheless, the SEC staff, in recognition of thefact that a simple reorganization presents relatively minimal risk to shareholders,has adopted a streamlined and expedited registration procedure for suchtransactions. SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin andplusmin;50, which originallycovered bank holding company formations only but is now applied to savingsand loan holding company formations as well, permits a registrant to omitfrom the applicable registration statement audited financial statementsand detailed statistical disclosure as long as certain conditions are satisfied.In addition, Instruction G to SEC Form S-4, which is the form utilizedfor most holding company formations, provides for the automatic effectivenessof the registration statement on the twentieth day after filing.Because the reorganization involves the acquisition of control of an insuredinstitution by the new holding company, an application to obtain priorapproval must generally be filed pursuant to the Savings and Loan HoldingCompany Act of 1967 (the ``Holding Company Act'').\3\<NOTE/> If the transaction is not one of a relatively narrow groupthat qualifies as an ``exempt reorganization'',\4\<NOTE/> the appropriate application under current Board regulationsis Application H-(e)1.\5\<NOTE/> This application requires detailed and often voluminous informationon, among other things, the proposed transaction, the financial and managerialresources of the applicant, the current business of the applicant, andthe future prospects of the applicant. The application also requires thefiling of detailed financial statements on both an historical and a proforma basis and certain exhibits. The Board believes much of the informationrequired in Application H-(e)1 is not necessary to enable the Board tomake an informed decision on a simple reorganization application consistentwith its congresisonally mandated responsibility to investigate the qualificationsof a potential acquiror and prevent the acquisition of control of an insuredinstitution under circumstances that might result in injury to the insuredinstitution. <T3>See</T3> H.R. Rep. No. 997, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967). Therefore,the Board is adopting new Application H-(e)1-S to be used solely by insuredinstitutions seeking approval of simple reorganizations involving the creationof savings and loan holding companies.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Holding Company Act prohibits any company, directlyor indirectly, or acting in concert with one or more other persons, orthrough one or more subsidiaries, or through one or more transactions,from acquiring control of one or more insured institutions without firstreceiving prior written approval. 12 U.S.C. 1730a(e)(1)(B) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Puruant to 12 U.S.C. 1730a(e)(1)(B)(ii) and 12 CFR 574.3(c)(1)(ii),an acquisition of control of an insured institution is exempt from theprior application requirement if the proposed transaction involves solelythe acquisition of control of that institution by a newly formed companywhich is controlled by the same acquirors that have controlled the insuredinstitution for the immediately preceding three years and entails no othertransactions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ 12 CFR 574.6(a)(1).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Eligibility for use of Application   H-(e)1-S</ITAG>In order to be eligible to use Application H-(e)1-S, an insured institutionmust be proposing a holding company reorganization transaction that qualifiesfor automatic approval under 12 CFR 574.7 (a)(2) and (a)(3).\6\<NOTE/> These regulations provide for automatic approval of suchapplications 45 calendar days after filing, as long as each condition specifiedin the regulations is satisfied.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See </T3>footnote 1 <T3>supra</T3>.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
