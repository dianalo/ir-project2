Demmer, vicepresident of midrange systems, said at a recent briefing here.andM;The Model 400s can have up to two vector modules, which are single-boardvector processors that plug into the system's back plane, Demmer said.andM;A FORTRAN compiler will have automatic vectorization and automaticdecomposition capabilities, Demmer said.andP;  Existing FORTRAN applications willrun two to five times faster on the vector processors.andM;Sandia National Laboratories has several applications running on itsVAX-based Supernet system that could benefit from vectorization, said RobertA. Whiteside, program manager in the Scientific Computing Division at SandiaLivermore in California.andP;  Supernet allows the laboratory to harness the powerof a network of DEC VAXes and MicroVAXes, Sun Microsystems Inc. workstationsand Intel Corp. 310 PCs.andM;A Monte Carlo computation running on the network would be able to run fasteron the vector machine, Whiteside said.andP;  However, he said, some applications,such as a rocket plume simulator, had been off-loaded from Cray Research Inc.andO;supercomputers because they did not lend themselves well to vectorization.andM;Whiteside is saving much of his judgment of DEC's vector processor until thecompany releases specific information about the hardware.andP;  But cost could bethe factor that woud make the laboratory move some applications off the Crayand onto the VAX, he said, predicting that &quot;cost will be the issue for manysites.&quot;andM;DEC does not have any plans to expand beyond two vector processors, Demmersaid, adding that the company will determine if the buss structure cansupport performance at a level of many processors at 18 million instructionsper second.andM;&quot;This is not a direct step to a massively parallel system,&quot; Demmer said.andP;  &quot;Itclearly has potential in the future, but now massive parallelism is lim itedto a few applications.&quot;andM;DEC also does not plan to add vector processing to its RISC systems, Demmersaid, although &quot;time will determine if users have a need for vectorization inthose application areas.&quot;andM;&quot;Vector processing support is arguably the most important facet&quot; of DEC'srecent announcements, said Terry C. Shannon, an International Data Corp.andO;analyst in Framingham, Mass.andP;  &quot;Digital's VAX vector program announcement isthe first step in the firm's expected migration to a new hardwarearchitecture based on a 64-bit version of the Mips Computer Co. R6000 RISCprocessor.&quot;andM;The 6000 family will replace the entire 8000 family, Demmer said.andM;VAX 6200s and 6300s, which now are referred to as VAX 6000 Model 200s andModel 300s, will not support vector processors, but the 6000 family isdesigned to be upgradeable, so users can enhance their systems when needed,Demmer said.andM;The Model 400 system is a midrange symmetrical multiprocessing system thatDEC describes as having between 7 VAX units of processing (VUP) and 40 VUP.andO;A VUP is roughly comparable to what commonly is referred to as a VAX MIPS.andM;The system comes with up to 2.2 gigabytes of storage in the cabinet and up to58.2 gigabytes of local disk storage.andM;Scientific and compute-intensive applications, such as computational fluiddynamics and computational chemistry make up a $1.3 billion market, and themajority of that is in the federal market, said Bob Nilsson, DEC's manager ofcomputational scientific applications.andM;The two biggest scientific markets for the vector processor, Nilsson said,are computational physics and computational chemistry.andM;Aside from the scientific market are applications aimed at civilian agencies,Nilsson said.andM;In compute-intensive applications, DEC expects the vectorized VAX to captureabout 20 percent of the market, Nilsson said.andP;  That would mean doubling DEC'scurrent market share, he said.andM;The vectorized VAX should do well against other vector machines because &quot;fromthe first day we announce it, there will be a lot of software for it,&quot;Nilsson said.andP;  Some of the software already runs on the VAXes, but takes toolong to run.andM;&quot;VAXes are used in all scientific solutions now, so there are many softwaredevelopment tools,&quot; Nilsson said.andP;  All those tools will work with the vectorprocessor.andM;Most vector software already is developed on the VAX, even if it will be runon a different system, Nilsson said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
