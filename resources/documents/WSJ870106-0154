Topless and bottomless, the women danced and soldT-shirts, negligees and garters. One performer simultaneouslypainted her body and a canvas on stage, and then sold thecanvas for more than $500. In total, the club raised about$20,000. &quot;A lot of these girls had rough childhoods; theywanted to do that for children in need,&quot; says Barry Maroon,the club's manager. &quot;Kids,&quot; he adds, &quot;don't care where moneycomes from.&quot;   Maybe not. But some of the people who run the kids'charities do.   A dozen charities rejected the dancers' money -- includinghospitals and a group for mentally handicapped children --before a few takers were found.   &quot;Even the appearance of cooperation with evil helps thisevil to continue,&quot; warned Auxiliary Bishop F.B. Henry of theRoman Catholic diocese of London, Ontario, in a letter to theWindsor Star. &quot;The Christian has a serious duty to take astand against evil and to share in it as little as possible.&quot;He questioned whether the money was offered for &quot;the reliefof human misery&quot; or &quot;with some motive of self-exultation andhoping to foster by this act a wider acceptance by thecommunity.&quot;   Whatever the club's intention, many people have indeedsided with the strippers. Newspaper editorials have blastedthe charities, which one column accused of acting &quot;holierthan thou.&quot; Ken Laing, a radio talk-show host for CanadianBroadcasting Corp., says that four-fifths of his callers havesupported Jason's.   &quot;I have a problem with some of the people saying 'Look atwho wants to make a donation,'&quot; sniffs Marcel Lefebvre,president of the Unemployed Help Center, which accepted$2,000 from Jason's.   The public reaction surprised some charities. Windsorcivic leaders have long tried to cut down on the number ofstrip joints. &quot;We felt if we accepted the money it would havebeen political suicide,&quot; says Harvey Kessler, regionaldirector of the Canadian Hearing Society, which rejectedfunds.   Adds Tom Suffield, director of development for Windsor'sMetropolitan General Hospital Foundation: &quot;By not wanting togive the club any publicity, we wound up doing just that in abig way.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
