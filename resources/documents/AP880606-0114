They urged governments to plan for the trouble and to adoptpolicies that will lessen the effects.   In their report, an international group of scientists urgedcurbing coal-fired power stations that emit carbon dioxide, limitingthe use of other gases that create a greenhouse effect in theatmosphere and coordinating government preparations for weatherchanges.   ``We still don't know the magnitude or rapidity with which thechanges will occur,'' said Bert Bolin, a professor at StockholmUniversity, but it is clear that ``climatic problems will be part ofpeople's lives over the next century.''   The study was a follow-up to a 1985 conference of theInternational Council of Scientific Unions at Villach, Austria,which endorsed the theory that gases trap energy from the sun nearthe earth's surface.   ``We are entering a new phase. We told the world what scientistsbelieve will be the case. ... Now nations and politicians must startto think about the problems,'' said Bolin, who pioneered work on thegreenhouse effect and the depletion of the ozone layer.   Average temperatures will rise by at least 0.54-1.44 degreesFahrenheit per decade, and the increase may reach 9 degrees in thetropics and polar regions, the report said.   Warmer weather will melt polar ice packs in summer, raising thesea level by 8-60 inches over the next 50 years, it said.   At least 30 of the world's largest cities, including New York,``definitely will be affected,'' said Jill Jaeger of the BeijerInstitute of the Royal Institute of the Academy of Sciences, whowrote the report.   Even if emissions of ``greenhouse gases'' were stoppedimmediately, those released over the last 100 years would raise theaverage temperature by 0.9 degrees and sea levels by 4-4.8 inches,she said.   The study was sponsored by the World Meteorological Organizationand the U.N. Environment Program.   Predicting regional effects of the climate change is difficult,but the worldwide variance, ``will be considerably larger than hasbeen known in human history,'' Ms. Jaeger said.   In two dramatic examples, she said more powerful storms couldcause severe flooding in Bangladesh, threating 50 million people,and floods could wash over the Nile Basin, where 10 millionEgyptians live.   ``Roughly half of humanity lives close to the sea,'' she said,adding that the United States alone will have to spend up to $100billion to protect its eastern seaboard.   Among other effects predicted in the report are:   _Greater evaporation may endanger water supplies.   _Less rain could threaten farming in some areas while makingagriculture possible in others, leading to population shifts andprobable migration to cities.   _Warming of ice-bound seas could have military implications innorthern Europe, North America and Siberia: ``If these coastlinesbecome navigable, fundamental security readjustments will berequired.''   _Permafrost in northern Canada and Siberia will graduallydisappear.   _Patterns of fish migration will change, some trees will havereproduction problems and some animal species will become extinct.It was not specific about the species involved.   The report named the ``greenhouse gases'' as carbon dioxide,methane, chlorofluorocarbons, nitrous oxide and tropospheric ozone.   It urged limiting emissions of the dangerous gases; developmentof alternative energy sources to fossil fuels, including nuclearenergy; an end to deforestation, and planning dikes and otherdefenses in areas vulnerable to rising water levels.</TEXT></DOC>
