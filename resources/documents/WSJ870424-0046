Carried by the momentum from yesterday's sell-off, the dollar fell to 139.95 yen in the first hour of Tokyo trading, eclipsing the previous low of 140.60 yen April 14. Traders said that Japan's central bank was intervening in the market, trying to defend a floor of 140 for the beleaguered U.S. currency.    The dollar began falling after news of a sharp increase in the U.S. gross national product, which at second glance appeared to contain a bad omen for future growth.    &quot;Some stop-loss orders brought us down here, and with the GNP number, there's no reason to buy dollars,&quot; said Philip Brewster, general manager, treasury, at Royal Bank of Canada in Tokyo.    In the U.S., traders quickly saw through what at first looked like a better-than-expected U.S. economic report and sold the dollar aggressively, forcing it down 1% or more against most major currencies.    The sell-off came despite coordinated intervention by four major central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve. That suggested to some traders that negative sentiment about the dollar runs deeper than was previously thought. The traders speculated that another sharp slide by the dollar may be in the offing.    &quot;The train is still on a roll, and the dollar will continue to come down,&quot; Albert Soria, vice president, foreign exchange, at Swiss Bank Corp. in New York, said.    The Commerce Department reported yesterday that the U.S. economy grew at a 4.3% annual pace during the first quarter, far better than the 3% to 3 1/2% rate that was generally expected.    The growth rate, however, was partly due to a buildup of inventories.    &quot;With no strong domestic demand and no strong exporting, that'll hurt growth in the second quarter,&quot; a trader at a New York branch of a West German bank said.    Nevertheless, the dollar was generally expected to gain immediately after the report, but just the opposite happened, traders said.    &quot;When the number came out, I said, 'Hey, that's good for the dollar,'&quot; John Lynam, a foreign exchange vice president at Security Pacific National Bank in New York, said. &quot;And then I watched and watched, and it went lower and lower.&quot;    As the dollar continued sinking, more traders jumped in on the sell side, pushing it down to 140.65 Japanese yen in late New York trading. That was barely off its post-World War II low of 140.60 reached April 14, after a report that the U.S. trade deficit had widened. The dollar had stood at 142.18 yen late Wednesday.    The dollar also fell 1% to 1.8063 West German marks from 1.8245. The British pound climbed 0.9% to $1.6433 from $1.6283.    Jack Kessler, vice president, foreign exchange, at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, said the dollar's performance yesterday demonstrates just how negative the market attitude toward the U.S. currency is. &quot;The sentiment is unchanged; the mood is still to sell dollars,&quot; he said.    &quot;If the market were bullish,&quot; he said, &quot;we would've bought the dollar back up to 1.8350 (marks) and 143 yen on that (economic) news.&quot;    In overseas trading, the central banks of West Germany, Switzerland and Japan intervened to support the dollar against the yen as the U.S. currency began slipping before the Commerce Department report. In New York, the Fed was believed to be buying dollars after the report failed to support the dollar.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery soared $11 an ounce to $460.40 in heavy trading. Estimated volume was eight million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $459.85 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Thursday, April 23, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
