<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-47-0802 </DOCNO><TEXT>Samples of both the YBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O{sub 7} family of high-temperatureceramic superconductor and the layered set of bismuth based superconductors,described by the set of crystal structures Bi{sub 2}Sr{sub 2}Ca(n-1)CunO(2n+4+delta),were synthesized and characterized by x-ray diffraction, and temperaturedependent resistivity and thermoelectric-power measurements. Superconductivityin the yttrium-based materials is relatively insensitive to rare earthsubstitutions for the yttrium. Critical-current measurements on thesematerials reveal two characteristic critical current values. The intrinsiccritical current, determined by the suppression of the transition midpoint,is estimated to be greater than 10,000 A/sq cm at 77K. The critical currentdefined by the R=0 point is much less in bulk ceramics and limited byintercrystalline weak links. For the bismuth-based materials, two high-temperaturesuperconducting phases were observed with transition temperatures near80 and 110 K. Evidence from thermorelectric power measurements is presentedwhich shows both electron-like and hole-like carriers contribute to theelectrical transport in this family of ceramic superconductors. However,all of superconducting transitions observed involve with transition temperaturesnear 80 and 110 K. Evidence from thermoelectric power measurements ispresented which shows both electron-like and hole-like carriers contributeto the electrical transport in this family of ceramic supercondutors.However, all of the superconducting transitions observed involve hole-likestates.</TEXT></DOC>
