The Rosemead, Calif.-based utility said that the workers were decontaminated and that none of them were exposed to radiation above regulatory limits. It added that there were no injuries and there was &quot;no danger to the public.&quot;    The incident occurred when the workers attempted to open a valve that is normally closed in the plant's Unit 2 containment building, as part of a scheduled refueling of the unit. The valve developed a leak and sprayed the workmen. Southern California Edison said it stopped the leak and held the water in the containment building until it was pumped by plant systems into processing facilities. The company said there wasn't any release of radiation into the environment in excess of regulatory limits. </TEXT></DOC>
