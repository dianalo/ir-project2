The plan, filed in Houston bankruptcy court, wouldliquidate the failed bank holding company and two units,MCorp Financial and MCorp Management, closing the books onwhat once was one of Texas's biggest banking operations.Peter B. Bartholow, chief executive officer, said he expectsan initial cash distribution of at least $155 million to bemade available to senior creditors &quot;in the fourth quarter ofthis year.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But the pace and ultimate distributions of the proposalhinge almost entirely on the outcome of two lawsuitsoutstanding between MCorp and the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., which seized 20 of the company's 25 banks in 1989 andsold them to Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio. Apart from thelawsuits, MCorp and its affiliates list total assets of about$450 million, against claims totaling over $1 billion.   In a lawsuit in Houston federal court, the FDIC is seekingabout $200 million, charging, among other things, that MCorpimproperly siphoned assets away from member banks before thecollapse. MCorp is countersuing, alleging that the FDICillegally precipitated the failure of several otherwisesolvent banks. MCorp is seeking actual damages of $250million and &quot;contingent consequential&quot; damages of $1 billion.   Meanwhile, a related and in some areas overlapping lawsuitis coming to a head in Dallas federal court. In that case,U.S. District Judge Robert W. Porter has already ruled thatregulators &quot;flouted&quot; federal banking law in the MCorptakeover, and is preparing to assess damages. MCorp has askedfor as much as $327 million, plus interest.   In an interview, Mr. Bartholow struck a cautiouslyoptimistic note about the outlook for a favorable settlement.&quot;We do not have to win on all fronts to produce some level ofdistribution or recovery to stockholders, including commonstockholders,&quot; he said. Under such a scenario, he added,senior and subordinated creditors would receive 100 cents onthe dollar owed.   Mr. Bartholow said that another lawsuit, this one betweenMCorp and the Federal Reserve Board over whether theregulatory body can force the company to bail out ailing banksubsidiaries, is largely moot, since MCorp has been sellingoff its remaining banks.   Meanwhile, one of MCorp's most vocal creditors, StanfordN. Phelps of S.N. Phelps andamp; Co., hailed the reorganizationplan and predicted that the FDIC would soon settle itsdifferences with MCorp. The FDIC couldn't be reached forcomment.</TEXT></DOC>
