The measurements were madeat 25{sup 0}C using a network analyzer connected to a flat-ended coaxialprobe that was pressed against the freshly excised tissue samples. Themalignant tissues that were measured include: liver, lung, kidney, spleen,colon, muscle, and mammary. The normal tissues that were measured include:liver, kidney, colon, muscle, and mammary. In general, at all frequenciestested, both {sigma}and {epsilon}{epsilon}sub o/ were greater in malignanttissue than in normal tissue of the same type. For some tissues of thesame type, the differences in electrical properties from normal to malignantwere small (kidney), but for other tissues (mammary) the differenceswere large. For hyperthermia applications, frequency-selective heatingof malignant tissue surrounded by host normal tissue is calculated fromthe measured electrical properties for certain tissues.</TEXT></DOC>
