Empire said the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.'s recent action eliminating its secondary reserve fund will result in a $5 million pre-tax charge for the quarter. Empire added that it would have pre-tax charges in the range of $7 million to $10 million as a result of the recent rise in interest rates.    The savings institution earned $33 million, or $2.20 a share, on a pro-forma basis, in the year-earlier quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
