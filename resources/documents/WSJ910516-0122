The survey, prepared twice annually by the CorporateResources Group of Geneva, said Tehran was a special case,ranking as the most expensive city by far on a cost-of-livingindex comparison but the least expensive when factoring inblack-market exchange rates.   The early-March poll noted that currency changes andinflation combined to narrow the list's top-to-bottom gap.   Tokyo and Osaka remain the world's most expensive forexpatriates, followed by Helsinki; Libreville, Gabon;Brazzaville, Congo; Stockholm; Taipei; Oslo; and Tripoli,Libya. The second 10 are Geneva; Zurich; Abidjan, IvoryCoast; Copenhagen; Dakar, Senegal; Douala, Cameroon; Beijing;Tel Aviv; Belgrade, Yugoslavia; and London. Paris ranked 23,Rome 24, and New York -- the base index for the survey -- was34th.                                                                                                          LEBANON CLOSES MILITIA PORTS                                                                                                          Beirut closed the last two militia-run ports, which sprungup during the civil war, and took full control of seabornetrade for the first time in a decade. The move is intended tohelp Lebanon's treasury by rerouting trade to fivegovernment-run ports. Lebanon, which imports most of its foodand industrial goods, lost about $100 million a year incustoms duties to the militia ports.                                                                                                          BURMA REOPENS ALL COLLEGES                                                                                                          Burma's military government reopened all colleges anduniversities shuttered since a failed pro-democracy uprisingthree years ago. But the junta warned the institutions willbe closed if unrest begins anew. Students led the bloodynationwide street protests in 1988, and the army, whichseized power in a coup amid the turmoil, shut down allschools. Pre-college schools reopened a year later and someothers, such as medical and dental schools, reopened inJanuary.                                                                                                          EGYPTIAN GETS TOP ARAB POST                                                                                                          The Arab League completed Egypt's rehabilitation in theArab world by choosing Cairo's highest-ranking diplomat,Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid, to lead the 21-nationgroup as secretary-general for the next five years. Thediplomatic victory was clouded by Egypt's break with theeight-member Arab coalition that opposed Iraq's invasion ofKuwait. Egypt, a coalition leader, is withdrawing its forcesfrom Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, undercutting a March 6agreement for a joint security force.                                                                                                          HONG KONG TOBACCO TAX CUT                                                                                                          Hong Kong's Legislative Council cut in half to 100%,effective Saturday, a disputed tobacco tax that has beenblamed for a sharp acceleration in inflation. The new dutyhelped fuel March's 12.9% increase in consumer prices from ayear earlier. The alcohol and tobacco part of theconsumer-price index accounted for 1.8% of the overall growthand rose nearly 52% from February.                                                                                                          GERMANY PLANS TO DEPORT JEWS                                                                                                          Germany said 269 Soviet Jewish emigrants who fled toBerlin from Israel during the Persian Gulf war must bedeported, touching off a row fraught with Nazi-era memories.The Jews' travel documents allow a stay until mid-July. Buttheir Berlin attorney warned of an uproar damaging toGermany's reputation unless Bonn reverses its rejection ofBerlin's plea that the Jews, who fled after Iraqi missileshit Tel Aviv, be given residence permits on humanitariangrounds.                                                                                                          U.S., EC URGED TO PATCH IT UP                                                                                                          In an effort to mend badly frayed trade ties between theU.S. and the European Community, the head of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade has become part referee andpart peacemaker.   In a speech to the European Atlantic Group in London,Arthur Dunkel, the GATT chief, expressed both impatience andworry about the state of trans-Atlantic economic relations.Disagreements about farm subsidies wrecked trade talks lastDecember that were supposed to have concluded the broad,four-year Uruguay round of negotiations. That round has beenkept alive by GATT officials in Geneva, but it could fallapart again unless the Americans and Europeans manage topatch up their differences.   Of the posturing, Mr. Dunkel complained that &quot;traderelations are bedeviled by accusations, self-righteousness,mutual misunderstandings and the inability to distinguishspecial-interest pleading from the general public good.&quot;Neither side can claim purity of motives, he said, though&quot;both sides appear to believe they are speaking frompositions of rectitude.&quot;   GATT studies have faulted trade policies on both sides ofthe Atlantic, such as the U.S.'s trade barriers in textilesand agriculture, and the EC's Common Agriculture Policy,which subsidizes farming interests and locks out competitors.                                                                                                          POSTSCRIPTS . . .                                                                                                          Thousands of Iraqis lined up under armed guard forpassports and exit visas after President Saddam Husseinlifted a blanket ban on leaving the country, imposed beforethe Persian Gulf war. . . . Moscow today is to sign over toBonn its share in the Wismut AG uranium mines complex insouthern Germany, closed in January after supplying theKremlin's nuclear program. The Soviets are to have noresponsibility for a radioactive legacy that could take yearsand billions of dollars to clean up.</TEXT></DOC>
