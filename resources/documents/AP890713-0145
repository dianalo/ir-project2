Hereare sketches of the leaders and their priorities for the summit.      UNITED STATES   President Bush, 65, is attending his first economic summit. Hearrives with proposals on global pollution, a new strategy forresolving the Third World debt problem and recommendations to fostereconomic and democratic reforms in communist Eastern Europe.   The administration is hoping that these initiatives will allowBush to assume the leadership role in the Western alliance oneconomic and environmental matters in much the same way heestablished his leadership on military policy at the NATO summit inMay.   On the environment, Bush will also be seeking internationalcooperation in combating depletion of the ozone layer, globalwarming, deforestation and ocean dumping.   On debt, the administration will be pushing the plan unveiledMarch 10 by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, which stressesvoluntary forgiveness by commercial banks of a portion of the $1.2trillion in Third World debt. In return, the banks would receiveguarantees underwritten by international lending agencies that theremaining debt would be repaid.   While economic growth in the United States is slowing, mosteconomists believe the country will be able to avoid a recessionthis year. However, there is concern about an uptick in inflationthis year and worries as well that improvement in America's hugetrade deficit may have stalled out.   Given Bush's extensive international experience, he at leastwon't have the handicap that former President Ronald Reagan faced athis first economic summit. In 1981, the other world leaders viewedReagan as something of an oddity, an actor-turned-president withstrange ideas about supply-side economics.         BRITAIN   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, 63, is the most senior of thesummiteers, having celebrated her 10th year in office in May. Butshe goes to Paris with her Conservative Party government in trouble.   In June 15 elections for the European Parliament, theConservatives were routed by the opposition socialist Labor Party.It was Mrs. Thatcher's first defeat in a national election since shewon office.   And for the first time since she won a third consecutivefive-year term in the 1987 general election, Thatcher's personalapproval ratings are behind those of Labor leader Neil Kinnock (34percent versus 41 percent for Kinnock).   In Paris, Thatcher expects major debate on the resurgence ofinflation. British inflation has risen from an annual rate of 4.2percent a year ago to 8.3 percent, double the average for otherEuropean nations.   The high inflation, accompanied by steep increases in interestrates, has led to consumer unrest and rising union militancy. Therehave been simultaneous one-day strikes by railroad and London subwayworkers, mainly over pay.      FRANCE   Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, 72, ranks No. 2 inseniority behind Thatcher, having just been re-elected to a secondseven-year term last spring. He is still riding comfortably high inthe opinion polls as his conservative opposition flounders indivisive squabbles.   His biggest economic headache is the same one he has had sincefirst elected in May 1981 _ unemployment, which has been at or above10 percent for several years. The French trade deficit has also beenrising in recent months.   Mitterrand's top priority is debt. He has long cast himself aschampion of the downtrodden, debt-ridden Third World.   In May, Mitterrand unilaterally forgave 16 billion francs ($2.5billion) in public sector debt to Africa's 35 poorest countries. TheFrench are looking for other summit countries to match thatgenerosity.   On the issue of the debt burden being carried by larger ThirdWorld nations such as Brazil and Mexico, the French want to come upwith a package amalgamating the Brady plan with ideas put forward bythe Japanese and by Mitterrand last September.   All those plans generally call for forgving a portion of the bigdebtor countries' debts in exchange for guarantees that the restwill be paid.      JAPAN</TEXT><TEXT>   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, 66, is the newest leader at thesummit and the most besieged. He comes to Paris at a time when hisgovernment is shaken by an influence-peddling scandal and byallegations that he kept a number of paid mistresses.   Uno, then foreign minister, succeeded former Prime MinisterNoboru Takeshita a little over a month ago when Takeshita resignedin the wake of the bribery scandal. Now Uno is rumored to be nearresignation because of the sex scandal and his political party is atits lowest point in 34 years of rule.   In an effort to shore up his image as an international leader,Uno will pledge nearly $40 billion in new funds for debt relief andenvironmental assistance to developing nations, an impressivepackage which should deflect criticism that Japan, now the world'slargest creditor country, has not done enough to relieve thecrushing debt burden faced by the Third World.   But it remains to be seen whether the new assistance package andother Japanese initiatives would be enough to defuse Ono's worseningpolitical position back home.      WEST GERMANY   Despite a vibrant economy, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 59, head ofgovernment since October 1982, is another summit leader facing majorproblems at home. Kohl's ratings in opinion polls have sliddramatically in the past six months and some observers say he maynot win federal elections slated for December 1990.   In an effort to bolster his image, Kohl announced a major Cabinetshakeup in April. At the summit, West Germany is expected to cautionagainst doing anything that would unleash inflation.   West Germany, which is expected to post a growth rate of 3.5percent this year, recently boosted a key interest rate in an effortto guard against inflation. The move, however, displeased the Bushadministration, which believes the interest rate increase will slowGerman consumer demand and dampen the country's appetite forimported goods including U.S. products.   It is expected that both Kohl and Bush will press theirrespective sides of this dispute during the Paris summit.      ITALY   Italy is going though one of its recurring government crises. Thecoalition led by Premier Ciriaco De Mita, a Christian Democrat,resigned May 19 and negotiations to form a new government are stillunder way.   De Mita, 61, will represent Italy at the summit in his capacityas caretaker premier. This has not been an impediment in the past. Acaretaker Italian government hosted the economic summit in Venice in1987. De Mita has headed up the government since April 1988.   Italian officials are focusing on three issues at the summit _cleaning up the environment, fighting the drug epidemic and ThirdWorld debt. On the environment, Italy would like to see standardsestablished to measure performance by each country.   According to one forecast, Italy's economy is expected to grow ata healthy annual rate of 3.5 percent this year and slow onlymarginally in 1990. But the upbeat forecast on growth is clouded byconcern over inflation, which has been creeping up to an annual rateof 7 percent.      CANADA   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, 50, will be looking inParis for confirmation that inflation poses a threat on theinternational front. His government has insisted that interest ratesremain high to avert the threat of inflation, despite complaintsthat they could speed the start of a slowdown or even, in the worstforecasts, recession.   The Canadian inflation rate of 5 percent so far this year is thehighest in five years.   Mulroney is in the first year of his second term and has embarkedon a program intended to eventually bring the government's budgetdeficit under control. But other than his austerity message, criticssay his government is adrift in the second term without any majortheme after the big drive to win approval in 1988 for a free tradeagreement with the United States.   The environment has emerged as a hot topic in Canada, so Mulroneyis interested in pushing the environmental agenda at the summit inhopes that he can portray himself as a world leader on the issueback home.</TEXT></DOC>
