Six weeks ago, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesfailed in an attempt to work out an agreement with six non-cartelnations for cutting oil output to bolster world oil prices.   Now, industry analysts say the regular mid-year meeting willprobably have to face up to the issue of controlling its ownproduction quota system.   Currently, 12 of the cartel's 13 members are pledged to holdtheir output at 15.06 million barrels of crude oil a day. Iraq isthe only member that refused to go along with the pact, which wasextended last December and is due to expire June 30.   While the quotas were designed to support oil prices at $18 abarrel, prices have been hovering about $1.50 a barrel below thatlevel.   Nonetheless, analysts said they expected OPEC to extend thecurrent quotas through the second half of the year and focus onrelated internal issues.   These would include persuading Iraq to accept a quota anddefining oil production more strictly to discourage cheating.   Venezuela is leading one faction that would like to see outputcut at least marginally to get prices up nearer to $18, said FergusMacLeod, an analyst with the London investment firm Barclays deZoete Wedd Ltd.   But a group led by Saudi Arabia would like to see a smallincrease in quotas to match projections of higher demand in therest of the year, he said.   MacLeod said it would be difficult to see how the two campscould be reconciled, adding: ``The most likely outcome when theycan't agree is a rollover of the existing agreement.''   In New York, Paul Mlotok, an oil analyst with Salomon BrothersInc., said he did not expect any major changes, saying the meetingwould not be dramatic.   At Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in London, Peter Gignoux,managing director of the international energy department, said healso expects OPEC to focus on the tangential matters. ``OPEC willbe more introspective,'' he said.   Iraq does not abide by the quota agreement because it wants aproduction quota equal to that of Iran, with which it has been atwar since 1980.   Iran's quota is 2.369 million barrels a day. Iraq's quota undera previous agreement was 1.54 million barrels a day, but it isbelieved to be producing 2.65 million barrels daily now.   Some OPEC members have been accused of cheating by classifyingoil as condensate, which is an extremely light crude oil, or as oilto be used in their own refineries. Neither kind counts againstofficial quotas.   Kuwait claims that 2 million barrels of OPEC oil a day are notbeing properly counted, Mlotok said. ``It's significant,'' he said.   At the cartel's earlier special meeting in Vienna, the cartelmade its first major attempt to create a worldwide coalition of oilproducers to boost oil prices.   The non-OPEC members have not been invited to this week'smeeting, but Mexico might attend unofficially, said Fergus MacLeod,an analyst with the London investment firm Barclays de Zoete WeddLtd.   Venezuela, an aggressive promoter of the coalition approach, hasbeen working to expand the non-OPEC group and has persuadedTrinidad and Tobago to join it, MacLeod said.   At the end of the April 28-May 2 gathering, the OPEC ministersasked a committee of six members _ Saudi Arabia, Venezuela,Nigeria, Kuwait, Algeria, and Indonesia _ to continue negotiationswith non-OPEC nations.   ``I don't expect an agreement with non-OPEC although I expectongoing discussions,'' Mlotok said.   MacLeod said: ``Most in OPEC want to carry on talking tonon-OPEC countries in the hope that if there isn't an agreement tocut back now there might be in the spring of next year.''   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, led a minority group inblocking the proposal to jointly cut production, which was firstput forward by the non-OPEC group.   The final proposal called for OPEC to cut oil production by300,000 barrels a day during May and June, when oil pricestraditionally are weak, while the non-OPEC group would cut outputby 5 percent, or 183,000 barrels a day.   Saudi Arabia argued that OPEC and non-OPEC nations should cutproduction by the same amount of barrels a day and that the OPECcut should be borne equally by all OPEC members.   The non-OPEC group consisted of Mexico, Egypt, China, Angola,Oman and Malaysia. Colombia participated but would not have beenrequired to cut its output.</TEXT></DOC>
