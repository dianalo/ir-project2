Iran's decision to send back Ambassador Ali Ahani was prompted byFrench Ambassador Christian Graff's return to Tehran last month,said Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored inCyprus.   The late Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini urged onFeb. 14 that British writer Salman Rushdie be killed for blasphemingIslam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.'' Two Iranian clericsoffered a $5.2 million bounty for his death.   The 12-nation European Economic Community, along with Sweden andCanada called home their ambassadors in protest and Iran retaliatedin kind.   Iran later severed ties with Britain over the affair.   Rushdie, an Indian-born writer, lives in hiding in Britain underpolice protection.   The Iranian news agency said Khomeini's decree had drawn``worldwide support'' and ``the EC states had to eat humble pie andquietly started sending back their envoys to Tehran; the last to doso being West Germany and France.''   Despite Khomeini's death June 3, Iran's new leadership has saidthe decree against Rushdie still stands.   The French edition of Rushdie's book goes on sale in bookstoresWednesday and its Paris publisher said orders have been brisk.   ``I am not publishing this book to reignite a religious war butbecause a publisher must respect his obligations,'' said ChristianBourgois, head of Editions Christian Bourgois publishing company.   Of the 55 million people living in France, 2.5 million are Moslem.   The novel was first published in English last year and the Frenchedition has been postponed several times. Bourgois said the delaywas in the translation, which was completed last month.   ``Tens of thousands of copies have been ordered,'' Bourgois said,without elaborating on how large the first printing was.   The Ayatollah Mehdi Rouhani, Paris-based spiritual leader of theShiite community in Europe, condemned the plans to issue the book.   ``This book injures the feelings of millions of Moslems,'' hetold French TV. But he added he had also condemned Iran's deathsentence against Rushdie.</TEXT></DOC>
