The announcement was the strongest recent statement fromthe group, the Semiconductor Industry Association, whosemembers met yesterday in Washington. Chip industry executiveshave been saying privately for several weeks that sanctionsmay be necessary if Japan doesn't reach by year-end a goal ofbuying 20% of its chips from foreign makers.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Sanctions should be considered only after it is clear theobjectives of the agreement will not be met,&quot; the group said.It said it &quot;will seek sanctions if it becomes clear that theJapanese will not fulfill their commitments.&quot; Most chipexecutives don't think Japan will reach the goal, part of an18-month extension last year of a 1986 trade pact betweenJapan and the U.S.   Meanwhile, some industry executives are pushing formeasures beyond the threat of sanctions to retaliate againstwhat they see as closed markets in Japan and unreasonabletariffs in markets such as Europe.   Joseph Parkinson, chief executive officer of MicronTechnology Inc. and chairman of the chip association, said inan interview that he will propose a temporary blanket tariffof 14% on all chip imports &quot;that would come downcountry-by-country as they behave themselves.&quot;   Separately, the chip association's leading indicator rosein February, reflecting a continued resurgence in orders.   The group said the book-to-bill ratio increased to 1.12 to1 last month, from 1.09 to 1 in January. A rate of 1.12 meansthat for every $100 of products shipped, chip makers received$112 of new orders. The figures for both months arepreliminary.   The ratio has been recovering from a low of .94 to 1 inSeptember as chip orders improved. February's ratio is thehighest since April 1991, when it was 1.14 to 1.</TEXT></DOC>
