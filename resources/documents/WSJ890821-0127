William Gray (D., Pa.), people familiar with the situation said.    Attorney General Dick Thornburgh wouldn't confirm or deny whether prosecutors had sought telephone records from any reporters. But in an interview yesterday on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press,&quot; Mr. Thornburgh said that such demands wouldn't violate the First Amendment's protection of free expression and a free press. If prosecutors tried to force reporters to turn over telephone records, they &quot;would be well within constitutional bounds,&quot; Mr. Thornburgh said.    A spokesman for CBS in New York said the Justice Department hadn't subpoenaed any records from the network or its reporters. The spokesman said he didn't &quot;have any information&quot; on whether prosecutors had threatened to subpoena the records or to try to obtain them from the telephone company in Washington.    The attorney general has said that he will dismiss and criminally prosecute any officials found to have illegally leaked information about the investigation of Rep. Gray's office. But Thornburgh spokesman David Runkel has said that the department doesn't intend to prosecute reporters for publishing or broadcasting information on the Gray investigation.    The internal Justice Department investigation began about three months ago. A grand jury has been convened in Washington, and at least one top Thornburgh adviser, Mr. Runkel, has testified under subpoena. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has interviewed other senior department officials, according to law enforcement officials.    About a month ago, the Justice Department threatened CBS that prosecutors were prepared to subpoena telephone company records of telephone contacts between CBS reporter Rita Braver and department officials, according to a person familiar with the situation. The Justice Department said its goal was to identify the official or officials who had leaked information to Ms. Braver that led to her reporting in May that Rep. Gray was under criminal investigation, according to the same person.    It isn't known whether prosecutors ever attempted to obtain the records from the Washington telephone company, which is a unit of Bell Atlantic Co. Officials with Bell Atlantic couldn't be reached to comment. Ms. Braver wouldn't comment yesterday.    It's unlikely that the Justice Department has subpoenaed records from the phone company, because such a move would almost inevitably have come to the attention of CBS's lawyers, who would have objected publicly, lawyers said in interviews.    FBI agents questioned Rep. Gray on May 29 regarding a criminal investigation into congressional hiring practices. The next day, Ms. Braver, quoting Justice Department sources, reported that Rep. Gray's office was under investigation.    Law enforcement officials subsequently said that the FBI was investigating allegations of a no-show employee on Rep. Gray's payroll. After numerous press reports on the investigation, the Justice Department said it wasn't investigating Rep. Gray himself and that he had cooperated with FBI inquiries.    Rep. Gray, nevertheless, has charged that the Justice Department's investigation, combined with the apparent leak to CBS, indicated that there was a partisan attempt to hurt his reputation at a time he was seeking election as House whip, the No. 3 position in the House Democratic leadership. Mr. Gray won the post.    This spring there were also press reports, based on law enforcement sources, of criminal investigations of former House Speaker James Wright of Texas and former Whip Tony Coelho of California. Reps. Gray, Wright and Coelho have all denied any wrongdoing.    The Justice Department recently reversed a longstanding policy of not criminally prosecuting government officials who leak information primarily to disseminate it to the public. The purpose of the former policy was to protect government whistleblowers attempting to publicize official misconduct or waste. But this month, the Justice Department said the protection won't apply any longer to government employees who leak information obtained from criminal investigations. </TEXT></DOC>
