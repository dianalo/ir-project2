Cucumbers with thepesticide may have been shipped to four states, they said.   One case was reported in the Seattle area and one in the Rentonarea south of Seattle, state Department of Social and HealthServices spokesman Frank Mendizabal said Saturday, the day thealert was issued. He had no detail on the exact number of peopleinvolved.   Roger Lowell, district director for the federal Food and DrugAdministration in Seattle, said it is illegal to use aldicarb ongrowing food products. But its effect on health is generallytemporary, he said Sunday.   The thin cucumbers, 12 to 18 inches long and about 1{ inches indiameter, were grown in hothouses in northern California by BarnardHydroponic of Redding, and distributed by Blue Anchor Inc., ofSacramento, Lowell said.   They were distributed by wholesale channels to both independentand chain grocers in Washington and Oregon and maybe in northernCalifornia and Idaho, Lowell said.   One family's illness was reported about a week ago but couldn'tbe traced to the cucumbers, Lowell said. The second family fell illThursday, and laboratory tests confirmed ``high levels ofcontamination with aldicarb,'' he said.   In Oregon, there were no reports of illness, but state officialsalso issued a public health alert Saturday. It warned that possiblycontaminated cucumbers had been distributed to groceries andrestaurants throughout the state by United Grocers Inc. and PacificCoast Fruit Co., said Dalton Hobbs, public information officer forthe state agriculture department.   Bruce Barnard, an owner of Barnard Hydroponic, said Sunday thathe would not comment on the situation until he had had a chance totalk with FDA officials. There was no answer at Blue Anchor onSunday.   Symptoms of ingestion of aldicarb include nausea, vomiting anddiarrhea within one hour of eating, Lowell said. Other symptoms caninclude blurred vision, excessive sweating and muscle twitching.   Lowell said Sunday that officials are unaware of any permanenthealth damage, adding that the symptoms pass quickly, like the flu.In fact, he said, many people who may have gotten sick in the lastweek may have thought they were suffering from the flu.   Aldicarb is a treatment for soil before crops are grown and isused mostly for non-food crops such as cotton. Lowell said aldicarbis the same pesticide that contaminated watermelons distributedalong the West Coast two years ago.</TEXT></DOC>
