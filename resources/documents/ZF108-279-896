Williams, an AutoCADdealer in Hummelstown, Pa.andP;  &quot;Being able to connect to a server and maintainfiber-optic [speed] has been unimaginable for a desktop system.&quot;andM;Although users have tried to connect AutoCAD workstations via networksbefore, slower network speeds and the dedicated nature of workstations havestymied performance, Nettles said.andP;  With the SunRiver system, users canoutput a drawing from a plotter without tying up a terminal.andM;&quot;The ability to plot and still do work is a big benefit to this system, butwhat's better is its price,&quot; said Paul Ogne, a beta user and softwaredivision manager at QuenchPress Specialists Inc., a manufacturing company inRoebuck, S.C.andM;While a typical AutoCAD workstation can cost more than $10,000, the CADLightterminal and fiber-optic cabling costs $1,599.andP;  The PC LightCard is priced at$999, and the LightAdapter costs $699.andP;  CADMagic software costs $495.andM;SunRiver can be reached at (512) 835-8001.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
