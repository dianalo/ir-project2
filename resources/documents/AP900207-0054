She would like the show taken off the air, but will settle forit being moved from an after-school time slot.   ``It's an adult talk show and it airs when most adults are atwork and children are at home,'' she said.   Mrs. Beams heads a national grassroots movement against Rivera'sprogram, one of several such loose groupings that have arisen inrecent years to battle objectionable TV shows.   Last year a Michigan woman, Terry Rakolta, persuaded threecorporations to pull ads from Fox network's ``Married ... WithChildren,'' which Rakolta complained was full of gratuitous sexualinnuendo.   Other companies withdrew advertising from ``Saturday NightLive'' in response to complaints about an episode in which the wordpenis was repeatedly used.   Many viewers are complaining about ``Geraldo,'' and somestations are listening.   Rivera publicist Jeff Erdel said ``Geraldo'' is being carried by199 stations in all but a few network TV markets, up from 162stations a year ago. But 25 percent of the stations have let Riveraknow they're not happy with his show, Erdel said.   Rivera and the show's producers have pledged a return to ``moresubstantive issues'' in an effort to win back sponsors and viewers,but some stations are holding out on renewals.   ``We haven't quite decided about `Geraldo,''' said Joe Bell,program director of KDFW in Dallas, which lost numerous sponsorsfor the show after Mrs. Beams contacted them. She asked that theprogram be rescheduled from 4 p.m., but so far the station hasrefused.   In Augusta, Ga., WAGT moved ``Geraldo'' from 5 p.m. to 10 a.m.in September after sponsors pulled out because of viewercomplaints, led by Claire Tankersley.   Mrs. Tankersley said she boiled after her 4-year-old watched a``Geraldo'' show in which a prostitute graphically described beingsexually abused as a child.   ``I was so horrified and aghast that something like that wouldbe on at 5 p.m.,'' Mrs. Tankersley said. ``I'm not for censorship,but I just don't think that kids should be exposed.''   ``Sounds familiar,'' said Jeffrey Ulrich, program director ofWROC in Rochester, N.Y., which had so many complaints about``Geraldo'' last year that it canceled the program with threemonths left on the contract.   ``The opposition we were receiving on the show was tremendous.`Geraldo' really raised a stink here,'' Ulrich said.   KNSD in San Diego took ``Geraldo'' off the air last monthbecause advertisers withdrew, said station controller Jay Belbey.   Mrs. Beams started her campaign against ``Geraldo'' after seeinga show in which Rivera interviewed guests about bestiality.   ``He asked them if they had had sex with animals,'' she said.``I turned it off.''   Other shows that raised viewers' ire include:   _ ``Men in Lace Panties''   _ ``Kids Who Murder in the Name of Satan''   _ ``When the Other Woman is a Man''   _ ``Kiddie Porn Underground''   ``I don't think it's wrong that some of these issues areaddressed,'' said Ulrich. ``But it's the way `Geraldo' exploitedthem. Phil Donahue could cover them and you wouldn't get the samecomplaints. Geraldo's problem lies in his exaggeration andsensationalism.''   Last month, at the National Association of Television ProgramExecutives convention in New Orleans, Rivera and his producerscourted program directors with promises of a more substantive``Geraldo.''   Executive producer Martin M. Berman said the show ``went alittle wild'' during the November ratings period, when it wascompeting for viewers in 125 markets against ``The Oprah WinfreyShow.''   ``We were pandering, and I'm changing to preserve my ownreputation,'' Rivera recently told Electronic Media, an industrypublication.   Erdel pointed to a show last month about migrant farm workers asevidence of a reformed ``Geraldo.'' He said stations are showing``very strong support'' and advertisers are coming back.   ``That's all fine,'' said Ulrich. ``But I think he's going tohave a hard time getting program directors and station managers andviewers to believe `Geraldo' is going to be any different.''</TEXT></DOC>
