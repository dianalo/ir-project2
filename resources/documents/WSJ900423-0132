Company spokesman George Gravley said layoffs of officepersonnel &quot;could happen,&quot; but no layoffs of drivers areanticipated.</LP><TEXT>   In addition to mechanics and their helpers, those laid offincluded parts clerks, truck drivers and other serviceworkers, the company said. &quot;Obviously, we have a reduced workload because of the strike,&quot; Mr. Gravley said.   The action came as an often violent strike by 9,400Greyhound employees represented by the Amalgamated TransitUnion entered its eighth week. No resumption of negotiationson a new contract have been scheduled.   Mr. Gravley said hundreds of union maintenance workerscrossed the picket lines when the strike began March 2. Inaddition to 690 maintenance workers represented by theInternational Association of Machinists and AerospaceWorkers, which is not on strike against the company, 695 ofthe 1,475 ATU-represented maintenance workers also returnedto work.   The layoffs included 155 ATU members and 120 members ofthe machinists' union, said Mr. Gravley, who added thatGreyhound hoped to eventually call them back.   Since the strike began March 2, Greyhound has struggled tooperate with replacement drivers and union crossovers. Thecompany is running about 72% of the scheduled routes itoperated before the strike. Ridership has been hoveringbetween 50% and 60% of pre-strike levels, according to thecompany, which says it is approaching the &quot;break even&quot; pointin terms of revenue.   Union officials dispute that claim. &quot;Every indicatorpoints to financial disaster for Greyhound Lines Inc.,&quot; ATUPresident James La Sala said Friday. &quot;Greyhound management isnow at a crossroads. It can either negotiate a settlement tothis contract dispute or allow this country's only nationalbus system to slide into financial ruin.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
