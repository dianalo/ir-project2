In a regular annual review of the Turkish economy, the Paris-based group warned that the current annual inflation rate of almost 80% is putting the structural development of the economy at risk, because of its negative effect on capital investments.    The OECD encouraged the government to follow through on its chosen goal of restrictive fiscal and monetary policies. These goals are &quot;impressive and, if carried through for any length of time, are likely to damp real activity,&quot; the OECD said. It warned, however, that policy makers should still be prepared for additional tightening, especially on the fiscal policy front.    The OECD forecast that gross national product will expand at inflation-adjusted rates of 6.3% in 1988 and 5% in 1989, down from 7.4% in 1987.    The average inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index is forecast to jump to 68% in 1988 from 39% in 1987, mainly because of the spillover effect from last December's government-ordered price increases. But the growth-restraining measures adopted at the end of last year are expected to show results in cutting inflation later this year and next, when the rate is forecast to ease back to 47.5%.    The sharp increase in inflation also was linked to expansionary fiscal and monetary policies in 1986 and 1987. &quot;The root cause of the inflation problem must be seen in the rapidly rising government budget deficits,&quot; which were partly financed by the central bank, the report said. As a result, the overall government budget deficit, as measured by the public sector borrowing requirement, rose to 8.3% of GNP in 1987 from 4.5% the previous year.    The OECD warned, however, that new cuts in government spending will be difficult to implement and might have a negative effect on some essential government investments. Instead, it urged the government to put more emphasis on revenue-increasing measures, especially by attacking the widespread problem of tax evasion and avoidance.    The OECD noted that the restrictive policies it proposes will automatically have some negative side effects: The high cost of borrowing money increases inflationary pressures; the scarce liquidity leads to delaying tax payments, further aggravating the budget deficit; and the increase in the liquidity ratio for banks might indirectly limit the effect of monetary tightening.    But the OECD warned that &quot;none of these considerations should detract from the present need to pursue restrictive demand policies -- and to be prepared if necessary to take measures additional to those already enacted, particularly on the fiscal side.&quot;    The report said that while Turkey's current account deficit is &quot;modest,&quot; the government should try to trim it further, because of the sharp increase in foreign debt, now 57% of GNP.    The current account deficit was forecast to narrow slightly to $850 million in 1988 from $987 million in 1987, before widening again to $900 million in 1989.    Policy makers were further urged to abandon the policy of export promotion through currency depreciations and export subsidies. Instead, the report said, they should place more emphasis on structural improvements in the export industry, including widening the product range, improving product quality and increasing the number of market outlets.    A cut in inflation is also a prerequisite to attract much-needed foreign investment, the report said.    Inflation also has had a negative influence on the development of the financial markets. The OECD recommends a gradual liberalization of the financial markets and development of the market for private bond issues.    &quot;Properly functioning financial markets require a greater degree of stability in the policy environment than has been observed in recent years, if an excessive volatility of exchange and interest rates -- and hence of capital flows -- is to be avoided,&quot; the report said. </TEXT></DOC>
