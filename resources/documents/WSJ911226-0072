But when Iraqi helicopters strafedthis Shiite city in retaliation, nearby U.S. troops stoodpat, and allied radio went silent. &quot;I kept turning the dialand shouting, `Where is America now?'&quot; recalls Abbas, who hasreturned to a classroom thinned by mass killings. &quot;How canyou say Saddam is like Hitler, then leave him free to murderus?&quot;   Almost a year after the Gulf War began, Saddam Husseinwon't go away, nor will questions about how the war ended. InIraq's wintry north, Kurds are on the run again, driven fromtheir villages by sporadic shelling and Baghdad's blockade offuel supplies. In the southern marshes, the army still isstarving out fugitive Shiites in what a senior United Nationsofficial calls &quot;silent genocide.&quot; And in Baghdad, SaddamHussein has elevated his most brutal deputy in a move thatmay herald even fiercer crackdowns.</LP><TEXT>   Saddam Hussein's survival deflates President Bush'striumph in the Gulf, exposing him to Democrats' jibes. Thefailure to topple the Baghdad regime at its most vulnerablemoment last March also leaves the U.S. with few options inIraq, beyond the hope that sanctions will prompt a coup.&quot;There's still a commitment to get rid of Saddam,&quot; says adisgruntled Pentagon official. &quot;But Allah hasn't told us howto do it yet.&quot;   This paralysis has alienated potential U.S. allies inIraq, weakening the U.S. hand if and when Saddam Husseingoes. New evidence from both Iraq and the U.S. shows thedegree to which the U.S. urged revolt last March, with noclear notion of what to do if Iraqis took the U.S. at itsword. For those who rose up, U.S. talk of promoting democracyand human rights now rings hollow. Many Shiites are turninginstead to Iran, while Kurds decided Monday to try once againto cut a deal with Saddam Hussein.   &quot;The whole war and its aftermath is a story of mixedsignals, missed opportunities and the phenomenal decline inthe idealism of American foreign policy,&quot; concludes KananMakiya, a leading Iraqi dissident.   Such an outcome was far from the minds of policy plannersduring the Gulf crisis. As troops deployed along the Kuwaitifrontier, the allies bombarded Iraqis with radio broadcasts,leaflets and even missives in bottles that floated ashore inKuwait. The message: Iraqis had no chance of victory, and nohope for peace and prosperity, unless Saddam Hussein leftpower.   &quot;The Iraqi military and the Iraqi people should takematters into their own hands to force Saddam Hussein thedictator to step aside,&quot; Mr. Bush said on Feb. 15, in one ofmany such statements.   This campaign reached Iraqis through allied radio,including Voice of America, which presents news and U.S.policies abroad. Between Aug. 2 and the outbreak of war, VOAdoubled the hours of its Arabic service to more than 15 aday. The military also used modified C-130 aircraft to boostVOA's signal inside Iraq.   In a Feb. 14 VOA editorial (vetted by the State Departmentand introduced as &quot;reflecting the views of the U.S.government&quot;), Iraqis learned that their soldiers in Kuwaitwere surrendering in droves. &quot;But for Iraqi civilians,&quot; theeditorial said, &quot;there can be no sanctuary as long as Saddamremains in power.&quot;   Much more inflammatory was a shadowy station called Voiceof Free Iraq, which began broadcasting from Saudi Arabia onJan. 1. Staffed by Iraqi exiles, and cleverly mimicking themusical theme of state-run radio in Baghdad, the stationlambasted Saddam Hussein and made emotional appeals for hisoverthrow.   &quot;We talked a lot about people power -- individually youcan't do anything, but as a mass no one can defeat you,&quot; saysSami Faraj Ali, the radio's London correspondent. &quot;We toldthem that the whole world was behind them.&quot;   Mr. Ali and other Iraqis say they were paid by the Saudisand later flown to Jeddah, where they issued appeals such asthis, during the uprising's first week: &quot;Pound the den of thetyrant in Baghdad to ensure the emergence of a new Iraq, anIraq of pride, dignity and democracy.&quot; Mr. Ali says thoseworking for the radio &quot;assumed the allies would push toBaghdad, the same way they pushed to Berlin in World War II.&quot;   When the push never came, dispirited broadcasters saidthey had been recruited for the radio by Saudi intelligence.Reports from the U.S. added that the Saudis were, in turn,acting at the behest of the Central Intelligence Agency, aspart of a psychological warfare campaign authorized byPresident Bush. A CIA spokesman says &quot;as a matter of policywe don't comment on such allegations.&quot;   But the claims came as no surprise to officials at the BBCMonitoring Service near London. They had noted that Voice ofFree Iraq fit the pattern of stations in Latin America longsuspected of having CIA links: an unusually wide range offrequencies and hours of transmission, statements on behalfof no particular group, and concealment of its point oforigin. Richard Measham, a veteran manager at the BBCMonitoring Service, adds that the Saudis, almost alone amongMiddle East powers, &quot;don't go in&quot; for propaganda broadcastsaimed at their enemies.   One group that does is the psychological operations(psyops) arm of the U.S. military. &quot;Persuasion when we can,deception if we have to,&quot; is how Lt. Col. Bryan Karabaich, apsyops adviser to Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, explains theunit's technique. &quot;We deal in the truth, but we mold it, thesame way Marlboro cigarettes does.&quot;   In mid-January, U.S. aircraft began dropping 21 millionpropaganda leaflets over Kuwait and Iraq. Most of theleaflets warned of upcoming bomb runs and urged surrender.But the military also targeted civilians. One leafletpictured a dove and the words, &quot;Saddam is the cause of thewar and its sorrows. He must be stopped. Join with yourbrothers and demonstrate rejection of Saddam's brutalpolicies. There will be no peace with Saddam.&quot;   The intent, says Col. Karabaich, was to soften civiliansupport for the war. &quot;To do this, we had to build awillingness to do something against the power structure,&quot; hesays. This campaign worked beyond the military's own dreams.As the U.S. made good on its bomb threats, soldierssurrendered en masse. &quot;Words and deeds reinforced each otherfor a very powerful message,&quot; says Col. Charles Williamson,who directs psyops for the U.S. military.   But deeds no longer matched words once the war ended. WithBaghdad's radio knocked out, allied radio monopolized theairwaves. Many Iraqis rose up, anticipating U.S. support,only to find themselves on their own. &quot;We were careful not tocreate false expectations,&quot; says Col. Williamson. &quot;But to theextent that there were messages that enjoined both militaryand civilians not to follow Saddam, then I think you couldsay we contributed to it {the uprising}.&quot;   Washington also was caught off guard by the revolt.Alarmed by the rebels' Islamic fervor, and fearful thataiding them would force the U.S. to occupy Iraq, theadministration balked just as the Baghdad regime appeared toteeter. &quot;The Iraqi people alone have the responsibility andthe right to choose their own government -- without outsideinterference,&quot; declared a Voice of America editorial on March7, when the Shiites controlled almost all of southern Iraq.   To administration critics, this seemingly neutral stanceflashed a green light to Baghdad. &quot;You had this mantra beingrepeated in Washington: `We're not going to get involved inIraq's internal affairs',&quot; recalls Peter Galbraith, a SenateForeign Relations Committee staffer who visited Iraq inMarch. &quot;This was a clear signal to Saddam that he could killwhomever he needed to stay in power.&quot;   Baghdad quickly deployed helicopters against the poorlyarmed rebels -- violating the spirit of a cease-fireagreement -- and Republican Guards slipped out of Basra,under the noses of U.S. forces posted near main highways. Asone senior officer puts it: &quot;We had overwatch of the trafficbut we didn't interdict it.&quot;   Iraqis' expectations that the U.S. would intervene helpexplain why the Shiite city of An Nasiriyah was one of thefirst to rebel and the last to surrender. Units of the 18thAirborne Corps were posted just 10 miles from the city,closer to the fighting than any other allied troops. Butrebels reaching the U.S. lines were disarmed, and requestsfor weapons and access to ammunition depots were denied.Shiite and Kurdish leaders add that senior Iraqi officers onthe verge of defecting were scared off by the U.S. stance.   As reports of mass slaughter trickled out of Iraq,Pentagon officials drew up a plan for protecting the Shiiteswith a &quot;safe haven&quot; similar to the one which later shieldedKurds. But no one acted on it. &quot;The attitude was, `the war'sover, Kuwait's secured, let's get the hell out of Dodge,'&quot;says a Pentagon official familiar with the plan.   The administration has kept its distance from both Shiitesand Kurds ever since, even while threatening renewed militaryaction against Iraq over issues such as nuclear inspection.As each such face-off between the U.S. and Iraq flares andthen passes, a conspiracy theory has taken root in the mindsof Iraqis. &quot;We lost both ways,&quot; says Mr. Ali, the formerradio broadcaster. &quot;Iraq is destroyed and the system is leftas it is.&quot; He and others suspect that the U.S. secretly wantsto help Saddam Hussein survive because it fears Kurds andShiites gaining power.   Some Congressmen now advocate that the U.S. arm and trainrebels, as it did in Afghanistan. Iraqi exiles also wantrecognition of a provisional government they hope toestablish in January. But the administration resists suchsteps, for much the same reasons it stood pat in March. Itfears that toppling the Baghdad regime will &quot;Lebanize&quot; Iraqinto ethnic and religious enclaves, threatening U.S. alliessuch as Turkey and giving Iran an advantage. Many alsosuspect that only a major U.S. military incursion couldchange the Baghdad regime.   The administration still hopes for the elusive coup thatwill install another but less-brutal strongman from theminority but ruling Sunni Muslim sect to maintain centralcontrol. Toward this end, and also to deflect criticism thatit isn't doing anything, the administration recently reviewedplans for military aid should anyone in Baghdad attempt acoup.   Iraqi dissidents say this policy risks helping anotherunsavory dictator seize power. Instead, they say, the U.S.should think long term. &quot;The U.S. should stop playingrealpolitik with the Iraqi people, and start helping tocreate a credible opposition,&quot; says Mr. Makiya, thedissident, who has written about Iraq under the pen nameSamir Khalil. &quot;Shape them, teach them how to work. And givethem the kind of public attention that will legitimize theminside Iraq.&quot;   He says America's current stance shows a distrust ofArabs' capacity for democracy -- a suspicion supported by Mr.Bush's tepid stance toward reform in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.Iraq, Mr. Makiya points out, has a large, secular middleclass that could buttress democracy. Iraq's vast oil wealthalso means that &quot;it's got a built-in Marshall Plan,&quot; he says.&quot;So this won't cost the U.S. financially.&quot; And while theremay be sectarian bloodshed if Saddam Hussein goes, this givesIraqis an added reason to seek U.S. help, as a broker betweencompeting groups.   &quot;You have a population seeking to do politics on its ownfor the first time,&quot; he says. &quot;This is an infant experience.It needs nurturing.&quot;   So, too, do the slim hopes of Iraqis stuck inside theircountry. Because Saddam Hussein still defies United Nationsconditions for Iraqi oil sales, food and medicine are scarce.Iraqis who took part in the March revolt live in constantfear. Abbas, the schoolteacher in An Najaf, says he rarelyrisks listening to his short-wave anymore. But to practicehis languages, he reads Western literature. These days, hisfavorite author is the darkly metaphysical playwright SamuelBeckett.   &quot;We are waiting for Godot,&quot; Abbas says, referring toBeckett's play about tramps vainly awaiting deliverance.&quot;Godot represents the hope. From where and when he will come,we do not know. But alone we cannot do anything.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
