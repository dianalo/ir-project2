As an insurance-case-management professional active in the field for almost 20 years, I am concerned at the negative tone in the medical community's response.    The concept of case management stems from techniques developed by Workers' Compensation insurance professionals more than 30 years ago. Severely injured paralysis and amputee victims of industrial injuries were surviving in greater and greater numbers, and new techniques -- originally developed for the Veterans Administration -- were then available at facilities such as the Institute for Rehabilitation Medicine in New York and Rancho Los Amigos in Los Angeles.    By referring patients to these new programs, which used aggressive rehabilitation techniques to provide a higher level of independence, an additional benefit was gained. This process reduced the length of hospitalization by more than 50%. The highest quality, state-of-the-art medical care proved to be the most cost-effective, and this became an established process within the Workers' Compensation community.    As a member of the original case-management staff at Occidental Life Insurance Co. in the early 1970s, I assisted in adapting the techniques and technology of Workers' Compensation case-management to standard health care -- for both catastrophic injuries and illnesses. Here again the idea stemmed from the concept that high-quality medical care is the most cost-effective.    Now, with the tremendous increase in health-care costs causing employers to seek out any method of controlling this rapidly escalating area, case management has become a buzzword. My major concern is to differentiate the original process from all the cost-containment techniques that can be lumped into this category. At Cost Care, we carefully delineate our cost-containment programs, such as hospital utilization review and second surgical opinion, from case management so that the original intent can be maintained.    However, with the proliferation of so many case-management programs and companies using cost control as their major technique in the past few years, it is not difficult to understand why there would be such confusion and concern on the part of the medical community.
