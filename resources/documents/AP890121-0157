Only a few considered the emotional, but just as potent, power ofa presidential inauguration to incite euphoria about the future,whether justified or not.   Perhaps the most confounding event of the past week was themarket reaction to the Commerce Department news that the tradedeficit, the most visible symbol of declining U.S. economic might,surged to $12.51 billion in November, reflecting a 2.3 percent dropin exports and 4.2 percent rise in imports.   The report suggested the United States was losing the battle toexport more and import less, a struggle to avoid what someeconomists see as a looming financial crisis based on America'shabit of spending beyond its means.   It was the sort of news that in months past would have incited aheavy selloff in the dollar and sent investors fleeing fromsecurities denominated in the currency, namely stocks and bonds.News of a ballooning trade deficit was one of the elements thatplayed a role in the October 1987 stock market crash.   Instead, the dollar surged in hectic trading despite efforts bythe world's central banks to stem the rise by selling dollars on theopen market. Elsewhere, the stock market rallied to a post-crashhigh, interest rates eased and bond prices strengthened.   What happened?   Many strategists scrambling for answers now reasoned that thedollar had been undervalued in the first place. Some said moreimportant economic signs, such as strong corporate profits, lowinflation and a decline in borrowing, had overshadowed the marketneurosis over the trade deficit.   Others maintained the overall trade deficit was shrinking inrelation to the country's total economic output. A few even heraldedwhat they saw as the reincarnation of the historic bull market onWall Street.   Dollar traders theorized the trade deficit news meant the FederalReserve would tighten interest rates, a signal that they should buydollars. But securities traders theorized that the economy wasslowing and the Fed wouldn't have to tighten interest rates, so theybought stocks and bonds.   Suddenly, almost everybody was finding good news in the week thatGeorge Herbert Walker Bush would become the 41st president of theUnited States, only a few months after the markets worried about hisinflexible ban on new taxes, indicating an uncertain commitment toreducing the trade and budget deficits.   In the chorus of enthusiasm that historically accompanies apresidential inauguration, only a few economists raised skepticalhands.   ``What's happening in the financial markets is that everybody ispretending the deficits aren't that important,'' said Robert Brusca,chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International. ``Nobody'spaying any attention to the fundamentals because the attention hasdiverted to politics.''   In other major business and economic news this past week:   _The Labor Department said the rate of increase in consumerprices last year totaled 4.4 percent, matching the 1987 gain. Butprivate economists said mild increases in energy costs last yearmasked more serious inflation.   _The Commerce Department said housing construction dropped 8.2percent in 1988 to its lowest level in six years. But industryanalysts said the housing industry, one of the most sensitive toeconomic slowdowns, remained healthy.   _Chicago's freewheeling commodity exchanges acknowedged a majorfederal sting operation to investigate possible widespread fraud.FBI agents posing as brokers secretly taped conversations on tradingfloors and reportedly implicated more than 100 people.   _Texaco Inc. agreed to sell its 78 percent stake in Texaco CanadaInc. to Imperial Oil Ltd. of Canada for $3.24 billion, a key part ofthe No. 3 U.S. oil company's post-bankrutpcy restructuring.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for weekend editions Jan. 21-22</NOTE></DOC>
