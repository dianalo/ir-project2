<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-52-0637 </DOCNO><TEXT>The molecular orbitals of the nucleon(s) in nucleus-nucleus collisionsare dynamically defined as a linear combination of nucleon single-particleorbits (LCNO) in a rotating frame by using the coupled-reaction-channel(CRC) theory. Nucleon molecular orbitals and the promotions of nucleon,- especially due to the Landau-Zener radial coupling are discussed withthe method above mentioned.</TEXT></DOC>
