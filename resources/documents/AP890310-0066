LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The active ingredient in some commercialsunscreens can break down into a substance that causes cancer,according to a study that has prompted further testing to determinewhether there is any risk to users.   In tests by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 14 of 17sunscreens containing the sun-blocking agent padimate O, itself usedto prevent skin cancer from overexposure, were found to contain anewly discovered nitrosamine, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reportedThursday.   Nitrosamines are a class of compounds notorious for theircancer-causing ability. Roughly 90 percent of the 300 nitrosaminestested so far have been shown to cause cancer in animals.   ``We have a saying in this field _ guilty until proveninnocent,'' said Stephen S. Hecht, director of research at theAmerican Health Foundation in Valhalla, N.Y.   ``You just never know,'' he told the Post-Dispatch. ``Basically,any nitrosamine is cause for concern.''   But representatives of major health organizations and thesunscreen industry said people who want to protect themselves fromsun-caused skin cancers should continue to use commerciallyavailable sunscreens until more testing is done.   Scientists said testing so far has not established whether thenewly discovered nitrosamine is a strong enough carcinogen topresent any substantial risk to people who use sunscreens.   William Lijinsky, an authority on nitrosamines at the federallyowned Frederick Cancer Research Facility in Frederick, Md., said thenitrosamine, which goes by the initials NPABAO, probably was a``very weak carcinogen.''   ``Compounds of this structure would have a very low activity orare inactive,'' Lijinsky said.   Representatives of the American Dermatological Academy and theAmerican Cancer Society said they were unaware of the nitrosamine insunscreens. They said that until officials reviewed any informationthat sunscreens were harmful, the groups would continue to recommendthe use of sunscreens to protect against damage from the sun.   ``If you want to scare people into not using sunscreens, thepublic health implications are super,'' said Gerald McEwen, vicepresident of science for the Washington-based Cosmetics, Toiletriesand Fragrance Association.   Padimate O, the sun-blocking agent, is found in some, but notall, sunscreen products, he noted. The association collaborated withthe Food and Drug Administration to discover NPABAO in sunscreens,then communicated information about it industrywide.   McEwen stressed that nitrosamines were a large class of chemicalsfound widely in the natural environment and that most human exposureoccurred naturally, such as by eating vegetables and other foods.   But three other experts said that because NPABAO is probablycarcinogenic. The three are Hecht, of the private, non-profitAmerican Health Foundation; Richard N. Loeppky, a professor ofchemistry at the University of Missouri at Columbia; and John S.Wishnok, a biochemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,in Cambridge, Mass.   Nitrosamines first gained widespread notice in the 1970s. Theywere found in tobacco smoke and snuff, vegetables and processedmeats, alcoholic beverages, cosmetics, pesticides, baby-bottlenipples, synthetic grinding fluids, tire manufacturing plants andeven new cars.   The FDA has yet to determine the origin of the NPABAO, or whetherit is easily absorbed through the skin and into the bloodstream, assome other nitrosamines are.   Officials of the FDA have declined to identify the sunscreenbrands in the tests. Results of the tests were first reported in Mayat the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer in Omaha, Neb.</TEXT></DOC>
