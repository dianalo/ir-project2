The decision came Tuesday as the Democratic-controlled panelvoted 48-4 approval of a bill authorizing the Pentagon to spend$299 billion in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.   The committee also cut President Reagan's request for Star Warsanti-missile spending and his plan to put multiple-warhead MXmissiles on western railroads.   By a 46-6 vote, the committee approved the tentativeadministration plans to go ahead and sell Japan up to four of theNavy's $1.2 billion Aegis-class destroyers.   An elaborate array of sensors and radars connected with guns andmissiles makes the Aegis the Navy's most sophisticated system ofdefenses for surface ships.   Japan wants to buy the ships as part of the Japanese role inhelping defend vital sea lanes near the Soviet Union.   Some legislators have opposed the move, arguing that the Aegisweapons should remain in the U.S. Navy. Critics have pointed to thecase of Toshiba, a Japanese company which has admitted helping inthe illegal sale of sophisticated machinery to the Soviet Union tobuild quieter Soviet submarines.   But Pentagon officials say the Toshiba case involved a privatecompany and they argue that the Japanese government has protectedother U.S. technology.   The committee voted Tuesday to approve only $3.7 billion for theStrategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known.Reagan had sought $4.5 billion.   In addition, the panel voted to approve $500 million forresearch into putting the MX aboard trains, $300 million less thanReagan had sought. At the same time, the panel increased Reagan'srequest for spending on the single-warhead Midgetman missile from$200 million to $500 million.   The $299 billion figure for total Pentagon spending was set lastDecember during negotiations between the White House and Congressover the effort to cut federal budget deficits. The agreementeliminated the normal congressional fight over how much total moneyshould be allocated for the Defense Department.   The bill is expected to go to the House floor late in April. Theversion that eventually passes the House will have to be reconciledwith the separate Senate version of the same measure.   The Star Wars decision would result in a deep reduction fromoriginal plans. The $3.7 billion figure would put Star Warsspending next year at about the current level.   Pentagon budget plans last year called for seeking $6.2 billionin Star Wars money for fiscal 1989, but that was trimmed to $4.5billion by Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci as part of a packageof cuts he ordered in response to the December agreement.   The dispute over the Midgetman and the MX involves two nuclearweapons at the heart of a 7-year-old fight over Reagan's plans forbuilding up America's nuclear arsenal.   Congress has approved 50 MX weapons for deployment in land-basedsilos, but the Pentagon wants 50 more for deployment aboard trains.Meanwhile, the Pentagon has been lukewarm toward the Midgetman, aweapon that has been a favorite of congressional critics of the MX.   Carlucci told Congress last month that he thought the Midgetmanshould be eliminated, but said he had included $200 million at therequest of Congress so the program could be kept alive untilReagan's successor makes a decision next year.   Meantime, Carlucci said $800 million should be spent forresearch into the rail-based version of the 10-warhead MX.   The committee's research and development subcommittee said lastweek that each weapon should be given $500 million and thatsubcommittee decision was ratified Tuesday after severalunsuccessful attempts to change it.   The panel also voted 43-8 to spend $1.4 billion for a newTrident submarine instead of using the money for two moreAegis-class destroyers. That vote reversed a decision last week bythe seapower subommittee.   The Reagan administration has sought three Aegis warships fornext year, but the subcommittee increased that to five by killingthe Trident. The two extra ships would be deployed in Japan underU.S. control, protecting Japanese security while keeping the Aegissecrets in U.S. hands.   Congress has already approved 15 of the giant Tridentmissile-firing subs, which are the heart of America's nucleardeterrent force.</TEXT></DOC>
