ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associted Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Oliver North's lawyers argued Thursday thatformer President Reagan ``is without question a material witness''and should be ordered to testify in North's Iran-Contra trial.   ``In this country a president is up from the masses and when histime is over he goes back to the masses,'' said North attorneyBarry Simon. ``We are talking about a person who is retired frompublic office.''   North, a former National Security Council aide being tried on 12charges in connection with the Iran-Contra affair, had wantedReagan as the leadoff witness when the defense case opens Monday.U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said he will rule Friday,which is a day off for the jury.   Reagan, who has called North ``a national hero,'' would be thefirst ex-president to testify in response to a subpoena.   The Justice Department and Reagan's personal attorney arguedthat Gesell should quash the Reagan subpoena because North'slawyers had failed to show that the former president has anyinformation that bears on the case.   But Simon insisted that Reagan ``is without question a materialwitness'' in the case.   ``We have a right to subpoena, put his testimony on live beforethe jury and let them assess'' Reagan's credibility, Simon said. Hesaid that a taped question-and-answer session with Reagan, one ofthe suggestions for handling the former president's testimony,would not be fair to North since it would not be ``live for thejury.''   One of the charges against North is that he lied to AttorneyGeneral Edwin Meese III when he investigated the Iran-Contraaffair, a fact Simon noted by saying, ``We have for the first timea presidential fact-finding inquiry being the source of a criminalcharge.''   He also recalled testimony that Reagan had admonished aides notto disclose to Congress that the Saudi Arabian government hadcontributed millions of dollars for the Nicaraguan rebels.   The prosecution wound up its case Thursday with testimony from awitness who told of muttering ``Jeez, that can't be'' when he sawthe first evidence that Iranian arms sales profits had gone to helpthe Contra rebels.   John Richardson had been sent, along with Assistant AttorneyGeneral Bradford Reynolds, to search North's office in the WhiteHouse complex on Nov. 22, 1986 to clear up conflicts aboutshipments of U.S. arms to Iran.   ``We'd been there for some time,'' Richardson testified. ``Bradsort of gave me a nudge under the table, handed me the document andpointed to one paragraph.''   That paragraph described using $12 million in ``residual funds''from the sales ``to purchase critically needed supplies'' for theguerrillas fighting the Nicaraguan government.   ``I said something under my breath like `Jeez, that can't be,'''Richardson said. ``Brad shrugged and put it back in the documentshe was working on.''   Richardson, who was Meese's chief of staff, and Reynolds thenmet Meese and Assistant Attorney General Charles Cooper for lunch.   Asked about Meese's reaction to the memo, Richardson said, ``Hewas very surprised.''   And Cooper? ``Cooper said something like `you're kidding.'''   Three days after they found the document, then-President Reaganand Meese announced at a news conference that they had uncoveredthe money diversion. Earlier that month Reagan had admitted thatweapons had been sold to Iran in a failed attempt to free Americanhostages held in Lebanon.   National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter resigned and North,an aide, was fired at the time the use of the arms sales money wasannounced.   Richardson was the 29th and last prosecution witness in thetrial which began Jan. 31. The defense case is scheduled to openMonday.   Richardson's testimony and that of Cooper before him was anattempt by the prosecution to prove one of the 12 charges on whichNorth is being tried: that he lied to Meese, who was conducting afact-finding inquiry for the president.   At the time they found the damaging memorandum, Richardson said,North aide Robert Earl was wandering in and out of the office.   He and Reynolds ran into North as they went out to lunch, hesaid, and asked for files from 1985 on the Iran arms initiative.   ``He said, `Well, you should have them all. I'll make sure youhave them when you get back. I'll get them out,''' Richardson said.   Previous testimony has been that while they lunched with Meese,North continued the document shredding that had occupied him deepinto the night before.   After they returned to North's office to continue their reviewof documents, North remained at his desk, Richardson said. Theyheard him tell someone on the telephone that ``Both of ourgovernments are overreacting to this.'' Neither the other party northe other government were identified in court.   North also told them that ``soon, I'm going to be backcommanding a Marine battalion. Someone's going to have to take ahit for this,'' Richardson said.</TEXT></DOC>
