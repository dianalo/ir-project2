ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After four days of questioning prospectivejurors, the judge and lawyers in Oliver North's Iran-Contra trialare learning that even in this news hub there are people who don'tgive a darn about what's happening.   By the end of Friday's session, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.Gesell had declared 24 women and eight men ignorant enough ofNorth's 1987 congressional testimony to earn them a shot at being onthe jury. Twenty didn't pass that muster.   Gesell had wanted a panel of 50 from which the jury of 12 and sixalternates will be chosen, maybe next week. But Friday, he reducedthat target to 45. The panel will consist only of those who persuadethe judge and lawyers they did not watch North on television, hearhim on the radio or read about him in newspapers and magazines.   ``Have you heard of Colonel North?'' Gesell asked a nurse'sassistant. ``No,'' she said.   ``Have you read of Colonel North?'' he asked.   She said, no, she only read her horoscope.   ``Does `the Iran-Contra matter' carry any meaning for you?''   No, she said.   But Gesell dismissed the woman when she said she could not findthe defendant guilty because ``I wasn't there.''   A supervisor of banquet cleanup at a posh White House-area hotelsaid ``I'm the type of person who, once the news comes on, I switchit off.'' And when she was asked if she heard North testify ontelevision, she said, ``with due respect to Colonel North, I foundthe conversation boring and walked away.''   To that, North lawyer Brendan Sullivan responded: ``He doesn'tmind at all.''   North, at the defense table, smiled.   Those chosen Friday included a woman who said she doesn't payattention to news because it is ``depressing.''   ``I don't like the news,'' she said. And when her mother, whodoes, turns it on, she said, ``I go to my room and lock my door.''   Sullivan pressed her for her recollections of the six days inwhich North testified before the Iran-Contra investigativecommittees. At those joint hearings in the summer of 1987, theformer Marine lieutenant colonel detailed many of the activitiesthat are now charged to him as crimes.   ``He was on TV all day long, on all morning, all afternoon andrerun at night,'' Sullivan said.   ``It made me mad, he was on all the channels,'' the woman said.``I did not look at it at all. ... My mother probably did. I callher the `news media,''' she said.   One woman who publishes newsletters and the like said she wastrying to get her business going at that time and ``by the time theday was over and the news came on I was out walking my dog.''   But she did know that North had a blonde secretary, Fawn Hall, aboss named (John) Poindexter, that he was a God-fearing man and thathe had something to do with money and arms on an international scale.   ``I know people either are for him or against him,'' said thewoman whose office is on Capitol Hill. She was excused.   A female military personnel clerk at the Pentagon qualified aftertestifying ``I hate bad news.'' A legal secretary in the FederalTrade Commission didn't qualify because she saw the first fewminutes of North's testimony before changing the channel.</TEXT></DOC>
