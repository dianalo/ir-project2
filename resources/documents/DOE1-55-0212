Each of the gases included isrecognized to be important to the future state of global atmosphericchemistry and climate. Included as greenhouse gases are those of directradiative importance to climate, those that act as radiative precursors,and those of importance as intermediate constituents because of theirchemical activities. Knowns, unknowns and uncertainties for each gasare described. This document focuses on information relevant to understandingthe role of energy and atmospheric chemical and radiative processes inthe determination of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.</TEXT></DOC>
