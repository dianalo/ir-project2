 Whenhe chopped it into pieces, he found himself with hundreds of copies of thebroom, each performing the task as uncontrollably as the first.andM;In the same way, software developers are often hard-pressed to make even asingle computer do exactly what they want, but falling hardware prices nowmake it feasible to exploit multiprocessor architectures in the search forgreater performance.andM;And users will accept no less, for this is the only approach that can keep upthe current rates of improvement in the computer price/performance ratio.andO;&quot;We have really studied the question of theoretical limits to the singleCPU,&quot; said Bill Rash, director of strategic planning at Intel Corp.'sMicroprocessor and Peripherals Group in Santa Clara, Calif.andM;Rash estimates that the upper limits on single-chip performance are a 250MHzclock rate and approximaely 2.5 instructions per clock cycle, &quot;so there'smaybe another factor of 20 available from the single CPU,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;Long-range, however, we need a lot more than that, and parallelism is theway to get there.&quot;andP;  Several processors, whether sharing a single chip orspread across a campus, will have to cooperate in solving tomorrow'sproblems.andM;Rash makes it clear that software, not hardware, poses the major problemsinvolved in making best use of multiple processors.andP;  These architectures aretherefore the critical frontier for applications development, not just in thenext century, but now and through the rest of this decade.andM;There are many ways to combine the power of several processors; each approachsolves a different class of problem.andP;  This technical discussion exploresseveral current solutions, at both the low and high ends, and considers thesoftware challenges that they create.andM;Every variety of stored-program digital computer gets its power from theinteraction of three components.andP;  Memory holds both instructions and the datathat those instructions should manipulate.andP;  Data elements interact withmemory, retrieving instructions and data, and modifying data as directed bythe instruction elements.andM;A single stream of instructions, operating in a sequential process on asingle collection of data, represents a uniprocessor design, sometimes calledSISD (single instruction, single data).andP;  (See Figure 1.)andM;In many applications, however, every piece of data is subject to the sameseries of operations.andP;  A number might be squared, the square multiplied bytwo and the result subtracted from 10.andM;When many pieces of data pass through such a pipeline of operations, vectorprocessing is an effective technique.andP;  (See Figure 2.)andP;  This architecturelets developers overlap operations.andP;  In the mathematical example above, onedata item might be undergoing the subtraction step while the next one isbeing multiplied and the following item is still being squared.andP;  Resultsappear as quickly as the slowest sub-operation can produce them, rather thanat the speed of the overall computation.andM;Vector processing can be optimized if the programmer (or the compiler) canchoose from several ways of getting the same result.andP;  It is faster, forexample, to add a number to itself, then add the sum to itself, than tomultiply the number of four.andP;  Vectorizing compilers are filled with suchoptimizations.andM;But optimizations cannot merely be local; maximum performance also requiresattention to the overall structure of the problem.andP;  In this way, programmersuse &quot;busy&quot; as a verb: &quot;We do that to busy the adder,&quot; they might say, codingan operation as an addition because that part of the hardware would otherwisebe idle at that time.andM;Optimal performance with vector processing comes when there are relativelylong pipelines of operations--maximizing the benefits of overlap--and when asingle pipeline of operations is applied to a large collection ofdata--minimizing the time lost to pipeline reconfiguration.andP;  Traditionalsupercomputers such as the Cray are often configured for vector processing.andM;All in Fine ArrayandM;For greater flexibility, but at a higher cost in hardware, each data elementcan have direct access to memory in a so-called array processor.andP;  (See Figure3.)andP;  A single instruction stream is broadcast to all data elements, creatingSIMD (single instruction, multiple data) parallelism.andM;SIMD is the driving technology for the Connection Machine from ThinkingMachines Corp. of Cambridge, Mass.andP;  Individually, each of its thousands ofprocessors is relatively feeble--weaker than the processor in many videogames--but when combined in large numbers, they produce a powerfularchitecture.andP;  For example, two Connection Machines with 32,000 processorseach allow the Dow Jones News/Retrieval service to perform free-textsearching of more than 175 publications.andM;The Connection Machine uses dialects of mainstream languages, extended fordata parallelism.andP;  FORTRAN extensions are based on the draft ANSI FORTRAN 8xextensions to FORTRAN 77.andP;  These treat arrays as objects, associating aseparate processor (real or virtual) with each element in the array, andletting a single instruction operate on every element of the array instead ofusing loops to traverse the rows and columns.andM;A parallel dialect of C, called C*, takes advantaged of parallelism withminimal explicit code.andP;  For example, loops are automatically turned, whenpossible, into concurrent statements that execute in parallel.andP;  A paralleldialect of LISP, called *LISP, provides many ways to exploit parallelism inlist-oriented processing.andM;For high-end SIMD applications, the Connection Machine is one option; smallerrequirements can be met with the Data Transport Computer (DTC) fromWavetracer Inc. of Acton, Mass., which serves as a coprocessor to a standardPC, linked via a Small Computer Systems Interface connection.andP;  The machine isavailable with 4,096 to 16,384 processors, with prices starting at $98,000.andO;DTC software development is conducted using multiC, a data-parallel versionof C.andM;SIMD is more of a challenge for hardware than for software, and SIMDarchitectures demonstrate rapid and dramatic improvements compared withsoftware-intensive approaches to multiprocessing.andP;  Data gathered by DanSiewiorek, director of the Center for Dependable Systems at Carnegie MellonUniversity in Pittsburgh, suggest that SIMD machines will reach the level of1 million processors by the end of 1992.andP;  By contrast, the moresoftware-intensive multicomputer (described below) will use only about 1,000processors; shared-memory multiprocessors will typically use fewer than 100.andO;It remains to be seen what qualitative breakthroughs will come from suchquantitative growth.andM;The vector processor and array processor use custom hardware, withinstruction and data elements treated as separate building blocks.andP;  The PCrevolution, however, has come from highly integrated processors, such as the386, at ever-declining prices.andP;  Where a single 386 was once considered ahigh-end CPU, more and more users can now justify the cost of several suchchips attacking a single problem.andM;Each chip will have its own instruction and data elements; the remainingdesign decision is whether the chips shall each have separate memories (aloosely coupled multicomputer, as shown in Figure 4) or share access to asingle memory (a tightly coupled multiprocessor, as shown in Figure 5).andP;  Eachapproach has off-the-shelf examples in a growing variety of applications.andM;At the high end, the multicomputer architecture is exemplified by the iPSCmachines from Intel Scientific Computers, a Beaverton, Ore., subsidiary ofIntel.andP;  These machines combine multiple PC-class subsystems in a &quot;hypercube&quot;architecture that provides efficient communication between any twoprocessors.andP;  Each node might have 2M bytes to 8M bytes of memory in additionto its processor--a 286 in early iPSC models, then a 386, and now a RISC i860processor in the latest model, with a 32-processor i860 system deliveringalmost 2 billion floating-point math operations per second.andM;Prudential-Bache Securities uses an iPSC/2 configured with 32 386 processors,handling a typical query in 15 seconds, compared with times of six to 12minutes on a Digital Equipment Corp. VAX.andM;In a typical financial application such as portfolio valuation, each &quot;worker&quot;processor can execute any of several valuation algorithms, depending on thetype of security that is being priced.andP;  This is more flexible than SIMDarchitecture, where each node would have to execute the same instructions atthe same time, and it also permits a modular style of applicationsdevelopment.andP;  The iPSC machines support C and FORTRAN, as well as explicitlyparallel languages such as Ada and Linda.andM;Ada, in particular, is a strategic language for multicomputer architectures,because Ada's tasks can be easily allocated across typical multicomputer ormultiprocessor arrangements.andP;  Encore Computer Corp. in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,andO;has refined its parallel-processing version of Ada to a high degree.andM;For example, the U.S.andP;  Navy performed a simulation that ran 5.8 times fasterwith six processors than on a single-processor machine, indicatingtask-management overhead of only 3 percent, Encore officials said.andP;  Encore'smachine is a shared-memory multiprocessor, using multiple units of theMotorola 88000-series RISC chip set.andM;Another high-end Ada multiprocessor that also supports FORTRAN and C is theTC2000 from BBN Advanced Computers Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., based on anexpandable architecture called the Butterfly switch.andP;  This is heavy iron forthe most demanding real-time applications, with as many as 63 88000-seriesCPUs, a configuration that draws almost 34 kilowatts.andM;A more economical approach is offered by the QNX operating system fromQuantum Software Systems Ltd. in Kanata, Ontario.andP;  Individual PCs run QNX asa high-efficiency multitasking operating system, but over a LAN it creates amulticomputer architecture in which any machine can send tasks to any node.andM;The rapid real-time response of QNX lets networked systems share theirprocessing power while meeting the needs of local users; tasks such as wordprocessing proceed unimpaired, even while spare CPU cycles are aiding incomplicated graphics or supporting parallel Make operations to build and linkmulticomponent programs.andM;Like Encore, Quantum offers near-linear acceleration as more processorsbecome available.andP;  In a Quantum graphics demonstration audited by PC WeekLabs, in which each line of pixels was farmed out as a separate task, anetwork of 13 machines performed more than 12 times as fast as single AT (forcalculated overheads, like Encore's, of around 3 percent).andM;But a multicomputer approach may not require such close connection betweenprocessing nodes.andP;  They may not need to be in the same cabinet, and may noteven need to be running the same operating system.andP;  Such distributed orcooperative processing represents a near-term path for systems evolution,with software rapidly emerging to support these options.andM;Database servers such as Microsoft Corp.'s SQL Server are one example.andP;  AStructured Query Language (SQL) database server receives high-level queriesand returns, not the entire database, but a relation (an object much like atable of data) containing only those records that meet the specifiedconditions.andM;Centralizing ResourcesandM;This centralizes the hardware and software resources involved in optimized,high-performance searching, and also lets the central server enforcedata-integrity rules instead of trusting each application to do this on itsown.andP;  At the applications level, utilities such as DataLens from LotusDevelopment Corp. are beginning to integrate SQL server access into end-userenvironments; the dynamic data exchange (DDE) facilities of Windows and OS/2also permit flexible interaction with remote data via DDE gateways that aretransparent to the application, such as SQLSoft's SQL Softlink utility forWindows.andM;Distributed graphics offer another potential use of multiprocessing power,often using the X Window System protocol for network distributed graphicsdeveloped at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.andP;  Many advancedapplications, such as three-dimensional drafting and visualization, demandtremendous resources and produce results best interpreted as images.andP;  XWindows protocols allow a remote application (the X server) to manage userinteraction with the primary application (the X client) doing the actualwork.andM;The server and client can be running on different hardware, even underdifferent operating systems, so long as they both support the X Windowsprotocols for describing user-interface and graphics events to each other.andP;  Xis well-established in the Unix community and will soon be fully available onmainstream PCs under Quarterdeck Office Systems' Desqview/X.andM;Another path to cooperative performance is the remote procedure call (RPC),where an application appears to be running on a single machine, but parts ofthe program are transparently routed to other machines for execution.andP;  Like XWindows, this can distribute the power of high-end 486-class PCs across thework load of several users; unlike X Windows, however, the RPC provides thisbenefit for applications other than graphics.andM;Also as with X Windows, this approach requires sophisticated applicationsdevelopment, with applications components that reflect the strengths ofdifferent machines, operating systems and network protocols.andP;  On mainstreamPC networks, these techniques are supported by NetWare RPC, licensed byNovell Inc. from NetWise Inc.andM;Multicomputer and exotic multiprocessing solutions are ideal forexceptionally compute-intensive applications.andP;  For example, 3 percent of theapplications at Prudential-Bache made up 97 percent of the VAX-processingwork load, according to William Anderson, the company's executive vicepresident of information systems.andM;Those applications were therefore rehosted to the iPCS/2 for substantiallygreater overall performance, he said.andM;By contrast, however, many business buyers seek a machine that will run theirmainstream applications with higher performance, never bogging down themanner of an overloaded minicomputer, but instead adjusting the distributionof computing power to meet varying demands--and using off-the-shelf software.andO;This is the promise of the last multiprocessor architecture to be described,the tightly coupled shared-memory design.andM;Multiprocessors came to the mainstream with the announcement last fall ofCompaq Compute Corp.'s Systempro, with a dual-processor option supported bySCO MPX, a multiprocessor extension of SCO Unix System V from The Santa CruzOperation Inc.andP;  MPX modifies the core of the Unix operating system (theso-called kernel) to make the kernel recognize and use additional processors.andM;MPX takes an incremental approach: Low-level code such as device drivers willexecute on a &quot;default&quot; processor, typically the one with direct access to theI/O bus, unless the driver is specifically coded to run on multiple CPUs.andO;This ensures backward compatibility, but at the expense of performance,because the default processor becomes a bottleneck until code migration iscomplete.andM;Wyse Technology, in San Jose, Calif., took a bolder approach with a bottom-uprewrite of its kernel for Unix System V/386, released in January.andP;  Running onthe Wyse Series 9000i machines, this fully symmetric multiprocessingenvironment can use as many as eight 20MHz 386 or 25MHz 486 chips, allocatingthe highest-priority task to the next available processor with no specialrole for any processor in the system.andM;The result, however, is extraordinary: Independent tests by AIM Technology, asystems-evaluation consulting firm in Santa Clara, show the 386-based 9000idelivering 2.9 VAX mips per processor on a six-processor system, comparedwith only 1.9 VAX mips for the single processor of a Compaq 386/20 (alsounder Unix System V/386).andP;  AIM rates this Wyse configuration, as supportingup to 220 users without noticeable degradation of performance.andP;  At thatlevel, the configured cost of the system is only $727 per user.andP;  The 486delivers 2.6 times the raw performance, and is rated by AIM as supportingfour times as many users under typical conditions.andM;Wyse Solution for PCsandM;For PC-oriented companies, the Wyse multiprocessing Unix supports VP/ix forDOS emulation on character-based terminals; Wyse also bundles the XDOSTransformer from Hunter Systems Software Inc., supporting direct binarytranslations of DOS applications to Unix with substantially higherperformance.andP;  Wyse also includes XDOS demonstration versions of DataEase, adatabase manager from DataEase International Inc., as well as BorlandInternational Inc.'s Sprint word processor and Quattro Pro spreadsheet.andM;This strategy builds user acceptance of a growth path from MS-DOS throughUnix, with the two operating systems coexisting indefinitely oncost-effective multiuse systems.andP;  Supporting DOS, Unix and Xenix applicationswithout modification, the Wyse multiprocessing environment offers &quot;the bestblend of traditional minicomputer advantages with the open systemsflexibility of the Intel/Unix world,&quot; said Wain Ballard, account executive atWharton Automation Associates, a Philadelphia-based systems integrator.andP;  &quot;Ican switch machines, operating systems, applications--everything is open.&quot;andM;Long-range plans from Intel include multiple 386-class CPUs on a single chipby the end of this decade; Intel briefings project multiprocessing,notebook-sized machines by the year 2000, with processors handling typed,plain-English queries, even speech and handwriting recognition withvoice-synthesized spoken replies.andM;The multiprocessing architectures of today seem crude by comparison.andP;  Andsoftware, not hardware, will determine when multiprocessing reaches a statusof invisible integration with users' everyday needs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
