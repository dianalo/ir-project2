(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   United Mine Workers President RichardTrumka renewed his call Saturday for The Pittston Co. to help end acoal strike that has expanded into wildcat walkouts by more than20,000 miners in six states.   Coal fields in the region were mostly quiet Saturday, a day whenproduction slacks off at most mines before they close down forSunday. No new walkouts were reported.   In southern West Virginia, a labor group affiliated with theAFL-CIO put together a truck caravan Saturday to take food tostriking miners.   In a letter to Pittston Co. Chairman Paul Douglas, Trumkarejected Pittston's assertion that contract talks are at an impasse.   ``Impasse can only be reached after the parties have engaged infull good faith negotiations that leave each side with no moreflexibility on the issues at stake. That is not the case here,''Trumka wrote.   ``First, Pittston has not engaged in good faith negotiations.Secondly, the union continues to remain flexible on working out thedifferences between us.''   Pittston last week declared negotiations at an impasse, whichallowed it to implement its latest contract offer. Federal labor lawrequires UMW leaders to present that offer to their membership.   Pittston also restored benefit payments to about 1,500 retirees,widows and disabled miners. The company had cut off those benefitswhen its contract expired in February 1988.   Trumka told Douglas the gesture was appreciated, but said it wasnot enough. ``Pittston's actions are too little, too late,'' hewrote.   Douglas said he had not received the letter ``and nothing(Trumka) now says can change that situation.''   About 1,600 UMW members went on strike against the Pittston CoalGroup Inc., a subsidiary of The Pittston Co., in West Virginia andVirginia on April 5. Other miners began unauthorized walkouts Mondayin southern West Virginia in sympathy with the Pittston strikers.   By Saturday, the wildcat walkouts had idled about two-thirds ofWest Virginia's 24,000 miners and miners in Pennsylvania, Indiana,Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee.   The West Virginia Labor Solidarity Committee on Saturday droveseveral truckloads of food from Charleston to strikers in Logan andBeckley. The 50 committee members in the caravan also planned tojoin picket lines after delivering the food, said spokeswoman ElaineHarris.   The caravan was part of a nationwide call by the AFL-CIO to helpthe striking miners. Tractor-trailer trucks bearing food from unionmembers in Pennsylvania are expected to arrive next week, Harrissaid.   ``This is just the start,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
