So secretive that it once shredded computer packing boxesto prevent snoopy competitors from learning the brand name,O'Connor is also adept at reacting quickly when catastrophethrows markets out of whack.</LP><TEXT>   Its young staff, heavy on technical expertise and light onprevious trading experience, continually pioneers new ways touse complicated computer models to plan and execute big stockand currency options trades. Now, through an alliance withSwiss Bank Corp., O'Connor has joined the handful of powerfuloptions-trading operations that dominates global markets in&quot;derivative&quot; products -- or instruments whose values arebased on other securities, such as stocks, currencies andbonds.   The alliance's traders are feared and respected on optionsexchanges in Chicago, Philadelphia and New York and among bigbanks and institutions that trade in huge over-the-counteroptions markets. And other options traders can't mimicO'Connor's trades -- as they might, for example, the moves ofa New York brokerage house.   &quot;If O'Connor goes in and buys call options on a stock,they're probably not doing it because they think the stockwill be up five bucks tomorrow,&quot; says John Wolfe, a formerO'Connor employee who now is a trader for the Chicago Corp.,a regional brokerage firm. &quot;People have come to therealization that O'Connor is usually trading one marketagainst another. Their portfolio is so big and complicatedthat it's hard to tell why they do what they do.&quot;   Among other things, the O'Connor/Swiss Bank alliance --loosely known as SBC, which also is Swiss Bank Corp.'snickname -- tries to capitalize when markets, such as stocksand currencies, fall out of alignment.   Here's how it can work: On Nov. 18, the alliance'scomputer models showed that the Dow's 120-point drop theprevious Friday had weakened the dollar to artificially lowlevels, particularly against European currencies. AndySiciliano, the 30-year-old manager of SBC's world-widecurrency operation, knew that if stock prices held firm thatmorning, the dollar's value would rise.   For an early clue on how stock prices would behave, Mr.Siciliano looked to the trading pits at the Chicago Board ofTrade and Mercantile Exchange. The two Chicago exchangestrade options contracts based on indexes of leading stocks,and the Board of Trade's contracts begin trading 15 minutesbefore the New York Stock Exchange opens. (Options contractsare financial instruments that entitle, but don't obligate,their holders to buy or sell foreign currencies,interest-rate instruments and stocks.)   Mr. Siciliano hustled across SBC's basketball court-sizedtrading room, past octagonal pods staffed by young, jean-cladtraders to the office of Mickey Carusillo, his counterpart inO'Connor's stock-option division. There, Mr. Sicilianolearned that Mr. Carusillo's traders in the Board of Tradeand Merc pits were hearing that stock prices would openslightly higher.   This news gave Mr. Siciliano an edge over other currencyoptions traders around the world. He told his currencytraders to buy as many dollar options as possible, wageringthat the dollar's value would rise.   When the Big Board opened, stock prices were mostlyhigher, and the dollar's value surged. SBC made a big profiton its options trades, though Mr. Siciliano won't say howmuch. Other firms have options traders in both currency andstock-index trading pits. Why didn't they do the same thing?In many firms, Mr. Siciliano says, &quot;Currency traders justdon't talk to the equity guys.&quot;   O'Connor has capitalized on other crises in similarfashion, including tens of millions in currency-tradingprofits in the aftermath of the 1987 stock-market crash.After the 1989 mini-crash, its currency traders scored bywatching early quotes on the Tokyo stock market. And inJanuary, just after the Allied air strike on Iraq began, SBCtraders sold lots of currency and interest-rate options, ineffect wagering -- correctly, as it turned out -- thatoptions prices would sag if the air war went well.   SBC tries to interpret how political events will affectoptions markets, frequently hiring political consultants, asit did during the Soviet coup attempt. Yet SBC executiveslike to stress that their technical trading system is unlikethe &quot;directional&quot; techniques employed by commodity orcurrency traders who follow market trends.   &quot;Our approach is built around relative values,&quot; says DavidWeinberger, an SBC managing director who holds a math Ph.D.from Cornell University. &quot;That means `arbitrage': tradingthings against other things.&quot;   A few years ago, O'Connor executives wouldn't have beenwilling to discuss their trading approach. New employees havealways had to sign agreements promising not to divulgecompany secrets. Before this year, no newspaper reporter hadever seen O'Connor's 30,000-square-foot trading floor.Security is intense at the SBC alliance's headquarters in theChicago Board of Trade building, with its maze of windingcorridors sealed off at strategic intersections bycomputerized locks.   For the first time, however, employees trained inO'Connor's technology-intensive systems are servicingclients, which has created a new openness to outsiders. Inaddition to doing trades for its own account, the alliancewith Swiss Bank designs instruments to help multi-nationalcompanies and other institutions manage risks of fluctuatingcurrency and interest rates.   SBC has won raves for its approach to such complicatedproblems as how to manage exposure to constantly changinginterest rates, a must for any corporation with significantdebt.   Robert Kopprasch, managing director of Hyperion Capital, aNew York firm that manages mortgage-backed securitiesportfolios for institutional investors, says he was amazed bythe sophistication of a system the alliance devised to helphedge interest-rate risk. &quot;It models the yield curve, twistsit, does things instantaneously,&quot; he says. &quot;I remembersitting there looking at it and just saying `Wow.'&quot;   One specialty of both O'Connor and its alliance with SwissBank is making markets: that is, selling options contracts toothers on the floors of options exchanges and in the muchlarger &quot;interbank&quot; over-the-counter options market. The SBCalliance makes markets in options on foreign currencies andinterest-rate instruments, while O'Connor itself stillhandles options contracts on stocks.   The alliance is stronger in some areas than in others.While it controls a whopping 15% of the $6 trillion globalmarket in currency options, its share of interest-rateoptions is much smaller. (In currencies, SBC's maincompetitors include the First National Bank of Chicago, withwhom O'Connor used to have a trading partnership; French bankSociete Generale; Goldman Sachs subsidiary J. Aron; andCiticorp.)   Though attire at the Chicago headquarters is casual,pressure to succeed is intense. And about one of four newhires doesn't make it, says human services director DavidZyer. One reason the alliance doesn't like to hireexperienced traders is that they tend to want to trade ontheir own, and don't mesh well with SBC's teamorientedapproach.   This cooperative style has created some friction withoptions traders who used to work independently as traders forSwiss Bank. As part of the O'Connor/Swiss Bank partnership,much of the bank's options-trading operation was merged intothe new alliance. Many Swiss bank traders who previouslyworked in Swiss and European cities had to come to Chicagoand be schooled in the O'Connor trading system. In somecases, Mr. Zyer acknowledges, it didn't work.   Because it pressures employees in some ways, the alliancetries to pamper them in others. A full-time kitchen staff,headed by a chef lured away from a local French restaurant,prepares and delivers a range of free breakfast and lunchselections so that traders don't have to leave their desks.There are lavish, monthly mixers in the Chicago trading room,with free hors d'oeuvres and open bars.   Jobs are specialized, with some employees responsible fordesigning or marketing risk-management instruments, some fortrading and some for hedging the big options portfolio SBCholds at any given moment. The typical career progressionincludes two years of technical training; stints as a trader,senior trader, risk manager; and, for a select few, loftierjobs as product managers and managing directors. The averageage of SBC employees: 29.   &quot;None of our traders resist technology,&quot; Mr. Weinbergersays. &quot;The people we hire to be traders have a mathorientation and are analytical by nature.&quot;   Indeed, SBC prizes technology so highly that the alliancehas given names to its computer training rooms to remindrecruits of its importance. One is called &quot;Black-Scholes,&quot;after a 1973 scholarly paper by Fischer Black and MyronScholes that transformed financial markets by introducing themathematical concepts now widely used in options trading.Another is dubbed, simply, &quot;Silicon Valley.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
