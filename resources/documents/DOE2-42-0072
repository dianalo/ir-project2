Based on measurements by the NationalInstitute of Radiation Hygiene in Norway, it is estimated that the averagelevel of radon decay products is 55 Bq/m/sup 3/ EER in dwellings locatedon the ground floor, and/or ground floor and first floor. It is furtherestimated that indoor radon exposure may cause approximately 240 deathsfrom lung cancer annually in Norway. Since indoor levels of radon andits decay products probably have increased in recent years, the mortalityestimate does not necessarily reflect the role of radon and its decayproducts in inducing lung cancer at present; it rather reflects the annualnumber of deaths from lung cancer which may be expected should the levelof radon and its decay products be maintained in the future. Since smokingenhances the effect of radon exposure, lung cancer related to radon exposurewill preferentially occur among people who smoke.</TEXT></DOC>
