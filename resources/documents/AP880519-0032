James J. Blanchardhas moved into the top staff job at the Democratic PlatformCommittee.   Democratic officials revealed Wednesday the personnel shuffletook place at the end of last week, a few days after the Democratsheld their first hearing on the 1988 platform.   Rosemary Freeman, deputy director of the state of Michigan'sWashington office, is now acting executive director of the platformcommittee in addition to her duties as its press secretary.   Cynthia Lebow, who quit her post as general counsel of theSenate Judiciary Committee to head the platform committee staffMarch 1, has been reassigned as a special assistant to DemocraticParty chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr.   Freeman said the personnel shuffle was done to make ``better useof people and abilities'' and to ``maximize our strengths.''   Lebow said, ``It's really just a question of using resourcesbest, especially when you're trying to do something long-distance.''   She said in an interview that she has been helping the partyreach out to its constituent groups, especially women's and civilrights groups, and will continue that work for Kirk ``for theremaining 56 days until the convention.''   The committee heard from several dozen witnesses, primarily fromstalwart liberal groups, at its first hearing May 10, and isholding several more forums around the country over the next fewweeks.   ``Having gotten that started, we're going to let Gov.Blanchard's people, some very talented people from Michigan takeover and do the rest of the events, and the drafting,'' Lebow said.   Lebow said, ``Kirk put me in the job with Blanchard's OK.'' Herremoval was ``a mutual decision by everybody _ Paul Kirk andBlanchard and myself.''   Kirk has instructed Blanchard's committee to keep the platformshort and styled as ``an open letter'' to the American people, notweighted down with a myriad of special interest groups' petpositions.   A platform committee hearing on defense issues that waspostponed last Friday in Norfolk, Va., will be held this Friday inAlexandria, Va.   Blanchard and the rest of a 15-member drafting committee willhuddle on Mackinac Island, Mich., June 9-13 to draft the platform.The full 163-member committee will take it up in late June.   The platform is on the agenda July 19, the second night of theparty convention in Atlanta.</TEXT></DOC>
