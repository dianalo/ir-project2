London shares climbed on renewedhopes for a British economic recovery. Frankfurt pricesadvanced broadly, stopping a three-session losing streak.   In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-stock index, which lost 508.57points Friday, declined 65.04 to 21007.11.</LP><TEXT>   On Tuesday, the Nikkei rose 167.36 points to close themorning session at 21174.47.   Monday's first-section volume was estimated at 130 millionshares, shrinking from 188 million on Friday. The previouslow for the year was 175 million shares on Jan. 13. IfMonday's final tally is less than 130 million, it would bethe lowest volume since Nov. 7, 1983, when 123 million shareschanged hands. Losers outnumbered gainers, 604-322, and 195issues were unchanged.   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first section issues,which dropped 25.92 points Friday, gave up 10.39 to 1574.47.   The Tokyo bourse's inactivity and lack of buyers was duepartly to the absence of fresh news after Saturday's meetingof officials from the Group of Seven industrialized nationsand to a lack of movement in foreign exchange and interestrates. Moreover, after the Diet, or Japanese parliament,opened a session Friday, investors were awaiting possibledisclosures of politicians' involvement in bribery or stockscandals, as well as President Bush's State of the Unionmessage set for Tuesday night U.S. time. Dealers also werereluctant to increase their positions a day ahead of the lasttrading day for January accounts.   In London, on the first day of the new two-week tradingaccount, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share indexrose 29.5 points, or 1.2%, to 2539.9. The FT 30-stock indexadvanced 21.5 points, or 1.1%, to 1966.4. Volume eased to448.1 million shares from 614.6 million in the previoussession.   Bullishness resulted in part from news that Britain's 1991current-account deficit was smaller than the governmentexpected, with fourth-quarter imports offering signs of agradual economic upturn. The data also showed a buoyant trendin exports, adding to expectations of a victory for theruling Conservative Party in the general election that mustbe called by midyear, and this helped push sterling higheragainst other European currencies. Shares also were supportedby opinion polls that narrowly favor the Conservatives; astrong opening performance on Wall Street; and a strongerdollar, which helped bolster several blue-chip companies thathave a large proportion of their earnings denominated in theU.S. currency.   In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-stock index gained 18.81 points,or 1.1%, to 1683.58. The broad advance -- all the DAX stocksrose -- in moderate trading was attributed to buying by someforeign investors and German institutions and to the market'sattempt to pull out of its recent consolidation. The boursealso was aided by the London stock market's strength and byindications that German inflation this month may be lowerthan previously expected.   Elsewhere in Europe, French stocks jumped on the first dayof the bourse's February trading account, though volume wasdisappointing. Madrid shares' gains were termed a technicalreaction to last week's market gloom.   Hong Kong shares dropped sharply on a second consecutivesession of profit-taking after the market's recent steepadvances. Elsewhere on Pacific and Asian exchanges, Taipei'srise in heavy trading came as small-capitalization shares,with their growth prospects, became the focus of buyinginterest. Manila shares' decline in a technical correctioncontinued. Seoul stocks rose on expectations of improvedintra-Korean peninsula relations, triggered by reports thatNorth Korean leaders have agreed to set up joint ventureswith South Korean companies; this boosted construction andtrade-related issues, which were viewed as the most likely tobenefit from improved relations.   Among corporate developments, in London, Legal andamp; GeneralGroup jumped 7 pence, or 1.9%, to 375 pence ($6.73). Theinsurer said it has reinsured 40% of its household propertybusiness, as unspecified reinsurers agreed to take onliability in return for a proportional share of premiumincome. Claims that led to a 1991 first-half loss promptedthe company to reduce volatility and concentrate on lifeinsurance and pension business. Legal andamp; General declined tocomment on reports that the 40% stake is valued at more than#100 million ($179.4 million).   Racal Electronics dropped 1, or 2%, to 48 1/2. The companyconfirmed that its pretax profit for the year ending March 30will be &quot;not less than&quot; #50 million and that operating profitwill be at least #100 million. It reiterated the forecastsafter British news reports suggested they weren't valid anylonger. In 1990, Racal had pretax profit of #223 million andoperating profit of #276 million. Year-to-year results aren'tcomparable, because they include the earnings for a businessthat has been shed.   In Frankfurt, Metallgesellschaft climbed 4.50 marks, or1.1%, to 420.50 marks ($263.57). The nonferrous-metalscompany said it probably will pay a dividend of 10 marks ashare for the year ended Sept. 30, unchanged from a yearearlier despite lower earnings, about which it declined toelaborate.   In Paris, Total slumped 16 French francs, or 1.5%, to1,047 francs ($192.46), after losing early gains from afinancial report by the company. The French state-controlledoil group, partly citing productivity gains, said it expectsto post a 41% increase in 1991 profit to 5.8 billion francs($1.07 billion) from a year earlier, and it declared a4-for-1 stock split effective Feb. 10. It estimated that 1991earnings per share rose 24% to 110 francs after accountingfor a 15% increase in shares outstanding. Total didn'testimate revenue, which totaled 128 billion francs in 1990.After the stock split, Total will have 210.4 million sharesand share equivalents outstanding, and the ratio for holdersof American depositary receipts will change to 1-to-2 from1-to-8.   In Stockholm, Volvo B shares rallied 5 kronor, or 1.3%, to398 Swedish kronor ($68.58), while Procordia B shares skidded14, or 6.6%, to 198. The previously disclosed proposal byProcordia, a drug concern, to merge with the auto makerdominated the Swedish market's activity, as about half theturnover was in these two companies' shares.   In Madrid, Telefonica declined 10 Spanish pesetas to 1,180pesetas ($11.70). Spain's state-run telecommunicationsmonopoly said it will pay a net interim dividend of 18.75pesetas a share for the latest fiscal year, unchanged from ayear earlier.
