Under Pillsbury Co., franchisees claimed, competitors suchas McDonald's Corp. and PepsiCo Inc. grabbed market sharewhile management milked the business. When Britain's GrandMetropolitan PLC took over in 1989, initial joy amongfranchisees was short-lived as executives ordered seeminglyarbitrary changes in their stores -- from floor tile tobackground music -- as they cut back on managerial help andcooked up a disappointing advertising campaign.</LP><TEXT>   That's why the 1,300 independent store operators hope thisweekend's convention at Disney World in Orlando, Fla., isn'tjust another trip to fantasyland. Times are tough in fastfood. What with clever new competitors, changing consumertastes, intense price wars and trouble finding good help,&quot;it's not a lot of fun,&quot; says host city Burger Kingfranchisee Manuel Garcia.   But Burger King executives, in interviews, insist thefuture looks bright. They plan to unveil a five-year strategyfor the nation's No. 2 hamburger chain, drawn up inconsultation with franchisees. In a business where the twosides often seem to be natural enemies, such accords arerare.   Barry Gibbons, Burger King's chief executive officer, sayshe held off calling a convention until now so &quot;we wouldconcentrate on the issues of 1995 and not 1985.&quot; He alsoacknowledges that &quot;the BK system has been through a decade ofturbulence.&quot;   The strategy document is expected to cover everything frommarketing thrust and new restaurant motifs to menu additions,perhaps including a commitment to dinner, which McDonald'salso is hard at work on. While declining to disclose details,Mr. Gibbons says the bottom line will be more money infranchisees' pockets. Mr. Gibbons had run some Europeanretail operations for Grand Met before being assigned toBurger King.   Mr. Gibbons is also expected to reaffirm Grand Met'scommitment to the business. Many franchisees wonder aboutthat. For months, rumors have flown that the Britishconglomerate wants to dump its billion-dollar investment.Franchisees, jittery about their investments, as recently astwo months ago considered possibly buying Burger King back --something they had looked into with Pillsbury just threeyears ago.   Richard D. Fors Jr., president of the National FranchiseeAssociation Inc., was one of three people on the latestbuy-out task force. &quot;We explored that possibility with theownership and were advised that they appreciated thecompliment -- our interest -- but that it was not for sale,&quot;Mr. Fors says. &quot;They said they prized the brand and intend tofully invest and grow it.&quot;   Many franchisees remain unconvinced. They still regard Mr.Gibbons's crew as cocky, and they don't like his penchant forcommunicating with them via videotape. Moreover, despitetraffic-boosting menu changes and a return to a favoredadvertising slogan, some store operators wonder about GrandMet's plans. In a memorandum outlining a regional franchiseeconvention last April, one operator said the theme would be&quot;Being successful -- on our own.&quot;   To assuage such fears, Mr. Gibbons recently recruited anexperienced manager from the motel industry, Barry A. Conrad.As president of franchise sales and service for the Americas,Mr. Conrad already has logged thousands of miles, calling onstore owners.   &quot;He's an operator's kind of guy,&quot; says Joseph Angel, afranchisee in Portland, Ore., who applauds Mr. Conrad forlistening. Adds Providence, R.I., franchisee Nick Janaches,&quot;I think they're paying attention.&quot; Others say managementcould have avoided numerous mistakes had it made such anappointment sooner. &quot;It took them a while to adjust to thesystem,&quot; says Ralph Aiello, a Burger King operator inPittsburgh.   Mr. Conrad is expected to give the franchisees feedback onwhat he hears at the convention. &quot;For the first time in quitea while everyone has the same hymnal to sing from,&quot; he says.   Seeking to recoup Grand Met's investment in the chain,management eliminated dozens of support personnel around thecountry-prompting Mr. Fors to complain in a letter that &quot;thequantity and quality of personnel is inadequate. . . .&quot;   John Lintz, a franchisee on the Arizona-California border,would agree. &quot;I don't even know who to call,&quot; he says. Mr.Lintz recently took out a &quot;For sale&quot; ad in a restaurant trademagazine to test potential interest in his three stores.   For a time management also shrank to a trickle localfranchisees' advertising dollars. More recently, theMiami-based company decided to feature a steak-sauce sandwicharound Thanksgiving, despite complaints from franchisees thatit hadn't been adequately tested.   Such moves have added to Grand Met's reputation as a toughbusiness operator. A scrappy one-time soccer player, Mr.Gibbons leads a management team not afraid to sue delinquentoperators or shutter stores that ignore health and safetyguidelines. Early on, he issued papers to field inspectorsauthorizing them to close violators on the spot. They did; itwas a company store. All told, Burger King has booted about100 sub-standard operators.   Sanguine now, Mr. Gibbons admits to initial qualms aboutthe business. He says he found himself presiding over &quot;a weakbrand in a weak sector inside a weak economy.&quot;   Today Burger King, in a similar business environment, isbelieved holding its own against McDonald's, which has a2-to-1 domestic market-share advantage. Technomic Inc., aChicago-based food consulting firm, puts Burger King's 1990share of the domestic quick-serve market at 7.1%, comparedwith 16.6% for McDonald's of Oak Brook, Ill.   That pleases Ian A. Martin, Mr. Gibbons's boss at GrandMet. &quot;We were told we didn't have a cat's chance in hell&quot;against McDonald's, Mr. Martin says.   Because it has fewer company stores than its three majorhamburger rivals, though, Burger King has decided to only ownstores east of the Mississippi River and is selling those tothe west, Mr. Gibbons says. That means it must rely onfranchisees for the system to grow in the western U.S.   The chain's operating earnings for fiscal 1991's firsthalf, which ended last March 31, totaled $84 million --virtually unchanged from the previous year. Grand Met doesn'tdisclose partial-year sales. For all of fiscal 1990, salestotaled $6.1 billion.   While it has shied from the discounting strategy ofMcDonald's and other chains, Burger King has been aggressivein making its menu more nutritious. It's testing what itcalls a &quot;lighter way&quot; menu of foods under 300 calories,including chicken on angel-hair pasta and chocolate mochapie. But Mr. Gibbons is scornful of low-fat hamburgers, suchas McDonald's' McLean Deluxe; &quot;A light burger to me is anoxymoron.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
