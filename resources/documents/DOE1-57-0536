In order to accomplish this, amodel of the technology-transfer regulatory process was developed, whichdescribes how policy initiates, translates into law, is implemented throughagency directives, and evaluated against policy goals. The Mexican process(as represented by it documents pertaining to technology transfer) wasthen examined and compared to the idealized model. Putting the case ofMexico in perspective, government documents dealing with technology transferfrom Argentina and Columbia were also studied, and the model was appliedto them. Findings indicate that the technology-transfer regulatory processhas evolved in Mexico to be rather different in the mid-1980s from 1972,when the first law was passed. The importance of indigenous absorptivecapabilities in the process of successful technology transfer has beenmore fully recognized,and the technical aspects of agreements are nowstressed. Mexico's case is different from the two other Latin Americancountries studied, in that it demonstrates more strength and continuityas it addresses the problems that in imperfect market structure for technologytransfer exhibit.</TEXT></DOC>
