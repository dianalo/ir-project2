The allies still must resolve several sticky details,including where to base the force, precisely how big it willbe and what mix of allied warplanes it will have at itsdisposal, U.S. officials said.</LP><TEXT>   Some European members of the anti-Iraq coalition wouldprefer that the new force be kept in far northern Iraq toprovide a clear warning to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to letthe Kurds live in peace, European diplomats said.   The U.S., which remains eager to get its forces out ofIraq, would prefer that the force be based nearby in southernTurkey, officials said. U.S. officials said that if Turkey'sgovernment is cooperative, the force might be based atSilopi, in southern Turkey.   Allied discussions also are under way about how big aforce is necessary to deter Iraqi attacks on Kurds. Some U.S.officials predict that the force will probably be the size ofa military brigade, or roughly 2,000 troops. Troops from theU.S., France, Britain and Italy are expected to provide thecore of the force, though other nations might participate,officials said.   The need to retain a rapid deployment force has arisenbecause of lingering uncertainty about the long-term securityof Iraq's Kurds, who rose up against Saddam Hussein followinghis defeat at the hands of the U.S.-led military coalitionthat drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait.   In negotiations, Saddam Hussein has promised broadpolitical freedoms and local autonomy to Iraq's Kurds, whomake up the majority of the population in northern Iraq. Butsuch promises haven't yet been put into a final, formalagreement, and such agreements have been broken in the past.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the force&quot;could supplement&quot; United Nations forces &quot;in maintainingsecurity in the area.&quot; The force would remain in the areaindefinitely, the spokesman said, but its size and &quot;specificassignment&quot; still are being discussed.   Creation of such a force would allow the U.S. to removefrom northern Iraq the last of its forces who have beenprotecting Kurdish refugee camps. Only one tent villagehousing about 13,000 Kurdish refugees remains in northernIraq; there once were three such villages in the area.   As the refugee population has dwindled, the number ofcoalition military forces has as well. The number of alliedtroops now is about half what it was at its height. The WhiteHouse said there now are 10,882 allied troops from eightcountries involved in the relief effort in northern Iraq andsouthern Turkey, including 5,749 Americans. About half of theallied personnel are inside Iraq itself, including 1,482 U.S.troops.   Only 57 lightly armed U.N. guards currently are innorthern Iraq to help protect the Kurds, although the U.N.and the U.S.-led allies hope that number can be boosted to500 soon.   The international rapid deployment force might be usefulto the Kurds more as a symbol of world support than as apractical military deterrent. It isn't clear whether theforce, particularly if it were based in Turkey rather thannorthern Iraq, could move quickly enough to prevent punitiveraids by Iraqi soldiers against Kurds in their villages, someof which are remote.   Moreover, it isn't clear whether the U.S. and its allieshave any desire to re-engage Iraqi forces if Iraqi reprisalsagainst Kurds become widespread.   But Kurdish leaders negotiating an autonomy agreement withSaddam Hussein have made it clear they would like some symbolof continued international support before they sign apolitical agreement with Saddam Hussein.</TEXT></DOC>
