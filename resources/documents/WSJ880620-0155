At a crowded outdoor news conference, a young mother brings her six-year-old to see Jesse Jackson. The boy wears a handmade badge on which is scrawled his name, Mark, and the words, &quot;I can read.&quot; His mother pushes him to an opening in the crowd and says: &quot;There he is. Look, that's what you can be.&quot; The little boy spends the next 15 minutes eagerly listening to the candidate.    ---   It is Murdock, Neb., where Mr. Jackson is in a farmhouse having breakfast with a couple who've seen the size of their farm shrink drastically because of the economy. Outside, Rita Ginger-Miller waits for him to emerge. &quot;Since Reagan's been in, we've all been a minority, and he {Mr. Jackson} knows what it's like to be a minority,&quot; says Ms. Ginger-Miller, who is white. &quot;The common person is the minority.&quot;    ---   It is a United Auto Workers hall in Kenosha, Wis. Angry workers, most of them white and many of them facing layoffs from the former American Motors factory, gather to hear Mr. Jackson denounce &quot;corporate barracudas.&quot; Middle-aged white women are wearing campaign buttons done in red, black and green -- the colors of America's black nationalist movement. &quot;His hope was to generate a change within the party and bring the working class back into the national politics,&quot; says Edward Steagall, president of Local 72.    ---   Today, with the primaries over and the nomination of Michael Dukakis a foregone conclusion, Jesse Jackson's campaign is winding down. Yet to a large degree, Mr. Jackson has accomplished what he set out to do when he first announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. He has succeeded in creating a movement across racial lines -- a movement of society's have-nots -- and giving that movement a driving focus for its political aspirations.    Mr. Jackson sees his challenge now as keeping an energized movement enthusiastic and unified after the candidacy is over. The issue isn't whether he gets the vice presidential nomination or a cabinet position, but his ability to solidify and institutionalize the profound impact he has had on American politics.    He has plans to create a political-action committee to help finance local campaigns, develop a think tank to research political and social issues and organize a massive voter-registration campaign to strengthen his constituency's influence. All of this is designed to build a lasting, multiracial, national political movement that will carry the Jackson message well beyond the current campaign. Whether Michael Dukakis or George Bush becomes president this year, Mr. Jackson is likely to remain a formidable force.    The difference between Mr. Jackson and other presidential candidates has always been more than black and white. They came from positions of governmental authority; he has always challenged it. They have big money and legions of staff; his war chest is puny compared with theirs, his staff a platoon to their armies.    Even a critic like Ben Wattenberg, a political analyst and neo-conservative Democrat, acknowledges that Mr. Jackson is &quot;quite clearly a remarkable political man.&quot; But Mr. Wattenberg says that's less important than the danger of his message. &quot;He stands in opposition to 40 years of bipartisan foreign policy,&quot; Mr. Wattenberg says. His policies &quot;would be bad for the country and a disaster for the party.&quot;    But Mr. Jackson's defenders say these criticisms miss the larger point -- that he has fundamentally changed the perception of how far a black can go in America. &quot;Jackson's legacy is that he has made it possible to conceptualize a black in the presidency and therefore in any other major executive position in the country,&quot; says Roger Wilkins of the Institute for Policy Studies and an adviser to the Jackson campaign. &quot;Jackson has made the unthinkable thinkable.&quot;    But Mr. Jackson has also managed to begin the process of growing beyond being a race-based candidate, some observers say. While he won only about 12% of the white vote in the Democratic primaries, according to New York Times-CBS News polls, he still did far better than in 1984, and clearly struck a chord with many whites.    Once thought of only as a &quot;black leader,&quot; Mr. Jackson now is &quot;speaking for an age,&quot; says Barbara Reynolds, the author of a sometimes critical biography of the candidate. &quot;He's evolved past being a symbol of black America, by being a symbol of progressive change in domestic policy and our foreign policy.&quot;    In that way, Mr. Jackson's campaign has been a &quot;metaphor for modern race relations,&quot; says Ronald Walters, a Jackson policy strategist and author of &quot;Black Presidential Politics in America: A Strategic Approach.&quot; Mr. Jackson follows Martin Luther King Jr.'s agenda, Mr. Walters says, but with considerably greater white support and a broader portfolio than the civil-rights leader had during his lifetime.    Mr. Jackson has seen issues he stressed moved upward on the nation's political agenda. His tough anti-drug message, for instance, touched on a deep concern in the country, forcing other candidates to scramble to come up with programs of their own. His outspoken attacks on South Africa's government and his emphasis on Third World problems focused attention on those important but often neglected issues. And his charismatic style and oratorical skills gave the campaign some of its few exciting and moving moments.    There was, for instance, Mr. Jackson's visit to the Coming Home hospice in San Francisco's Castro Street area, where he grasped the hands of patients waiting to die from AIDS. &quot;I think he's a wonder man, if there is such a thing,&quot; said Roger Haynes, suffering from AIDS. Outside the hospice, hundreds of people waited in a cold drizzle to see Mr. Jackson. &quot;We love you, Jesse,&quot; called a voice from the rear of the crowd.    It was a call Mr. Jackson heard frequently on the trail, reflecting a campaign message that at times has been more emotional than political. At the hospice, he spoke of the need for &quot;human compassion without any limitation,&quot; and some of the most electric moments of his campaign have come during intense sessions with high-school students. He asks them to stand if they have used drugs, if they know someone who died from drugs, if they know someone who contemplated suicide. Eventually, nearly all are standing.    In overwhelmingly white Redmond, Ore., a crowd equaling half the town's 7,000 population cheered his cry against dope in Redmond High School. &quot;When he spoke to this crowd, I believe he spoke as no other candidate since the Kennedys and certainly no other person since Martin Luther King to the hope and aspirations of young people,&quot; said Ken Noah, the principal. &quot;I think our kids are hungry for a candidacy that creates that dream and that sense of hope in them.&quot;    Throughout his campaign, Mr. Jackson made a point of spending time with groups that haven't much political clout. He visited little McFarland, Calif., where residents have been dying of cancer at an alarming and mysterious rate. A few weeks ago, he took a long motorcade ride from a small western Montana airport to the Flathead Reservation in Arlee. At powwow grounds surrounded by pine-covered mountains, he was greeted by hundreds of Salish and Kootenai Indians, some performing traditional song and dance.    For Winona Tanner, 26, a legal secretary in the tribal legal department, Mr. Jackson's visit was &quot;magical.&quot; &quot;Nothing like this has ever happened to our group of people,&quot; she said. &quot;It sparked a lot of interest in voting. It brought out to our people that, yes, our vote does count.&quot;    Among all Mr. Jackson's constituencies, though, it is still the black community, particularly the elderly, who feel the most deeply about his run. &quot;Now Jackson is taking over where King left off. I hope he'll finish it,&quot; said 98-year-old Hazel O'Hara, a Richmond, Calif., resident who hobbled on her cane to see her &quot;man for the country.&quot;    &quot;We didn't have no respect,&quot; she continued. &quot;Just to think where we came from and where we are, it's remarkable. To have one of ours step out and choose the highest position in the land -- it's wonderful.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
