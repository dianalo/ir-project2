Ten people were also injured in the melee that ensued whenhundreds of helmeted riot police swinging batons moved in on thepeaceful crowd. The injured were three policemen and sevenprotesters.   The official news agency CTK, giving the tally of those arrestedand injured, said the foreigners came from 11 different countries.It did not identify any by either nationality or name.   Official media accused U.S.-funded radio stations and Westernmedia of encouraging the rally, the largest anti-government protestin 20 years.   The peaceful protest began at 3 p.m. Saturday, when thousands ofCzechoslovaks defied warnings from communist authorities to stayoff the streets and rallied in memory of the proclamation ofCzechoslovak independence on Oct. 28, 1918.   Police moved in swiftly after the crowd began chanting demandsfor free elections and a new government. The helmeted riot squadsbeat up several people, and made those detained stand spread-eagledagainst police vans before whisking them away in waiting buses.   ``We want no violence,'' protesters chanted as they were pennedin by riot police. ``We've got bare hands,'' they shouted, raisingtheir hands to show they were unarmed.   CTK said police used ``mild means'' to break up the rally afterabout 3,000 of the protesters ignored police loudspeaker warningsto disperse.   State television broadcast pictures of Western camera crewsfilming the rally, and a commentator suggested they were partlyresponsible for the demonstration.   CTK accused the U.S.-funded radio stations Voice of America andRadio Free Europe of helping to organize the protest. Theirbroadcasts in Czech and Slovak can be widely heard inCzechoslovakia.   City streets and most bridges across the Vltava river that runsthrough Prague were sealed off as sporadic demonstrationscontinued. Sirens wailed through the city and dozens of police vansraced through the streets.   Police seized the film of several Western photographers.   Hours before the rally began, the Communist government held anofficial military parade on Wenceslas Square to commemorate Oct.28, 1918, when the Czechoslovak state came into existence.   The Communists took power in 1948, and Czechoslovakia remainsone of the East bloc's most rigidly controlled states.   About 1,500 soldiers stood ramrod straight as Defense MinisterGen. Milan Vaclavik instructed them to swear allegiance to defendtheir homeland.   Josef Kempny, head of the Communist-dominated Czech NationalCouncil, stressed in a 15-minute speech the importance ofpreserving Communist power and reiterated that the government willnot seek dialogue with independent, pro-democracy groups.   ``There is no sense in debate with those who like to talk, butwho oppose February 1948 and are against socialism, who care onlyfor the return of capitalism and who try to distract our honestworkers from their work and to create chaos,'' Kempny said.   His speech drew scant applause from an estimated 3,000Czechoslovaks who were given special passes to be allowed throughpolice cordons and metal barriers for the ceremony.   Three hours later, a crowd stood on the same spot, demandingfreedom and a new government.   The crowd chanted the name of Tomas Garrique Masaryk, thephilosopher who founded independent Czechoslovakia, and cheered atbanners reading ``The Truth Will Prevail,'' and ``We Will Not LetThe Republic Be Disrupted'' _ a popular Communist slogan turned onits head by the demonstrators.   Protesters also chanted support for the Charter 77 human rightsgroup and for dissident playwright Vaclav Havel, the group's mostprominent member who was detained last week.   After police began clearing the square, about 2,000 protestersmarched to the hospital where Havel, suffering from a bronchialailment, was taken Thursday after his detention.   Another 2,000 demonstrators made their way to old town square,which like Wenceslas is a historic rallying spot. They sang thenational anthem and chanted more slogans before riot police movedin.   A group of 3,000 to 4,000 young people moved to the Red Armysquare, where hundreds of riot police again dispersed them.   Last year, about 5,000 people rallied at Wenceslas Square onOct. 28 and were dispersed by riot police using dogs, watercannons, tear gas and batons. At least 87 people were arrested.   Last week, authorities arrested at least 11 dissidents toprevent them from attending Saturday's rally, but activists saidothers escaped the police dragnet to attend.   Dissidents said before Saturday's rally that recentdemonstrations for more democracy in neighboring East Germany hadincreased popular desire in Czechoslovakia to show the rulingCommunists people want more freedom.   The government in Czechoslovakia, unlike its neighbors inPoland, Hungary, the Soviet Union and now in East Germany, hasinitiated only tentative reforms and refused dialogue withindependent groups.</TEXT></DOC>
