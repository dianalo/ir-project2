(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Suspended Navajo Tribal Chairman PeterMacDonald was accused of 111 criminal charges Wednesday, includingbribery, fraud, conspiracy and elections violations while he ledthe nation's largest Indian tribe.   Special prosecutors hired by the Tribal Council filed afive-pronged complaint in Navajo District Court in Window Rock, thetribal capital, after a four-hour review of the charges by JudgeRobert Yazzie.   Shortly before the charges were disclosed, MacDonald denouncedthem as ``baloney.''   ``They are the same old laundry that they've been hanging outfor the last year and a half,'' he told The Associated Press later,after learning of the specific charges.   One complaint charges MacDonald with 27 counts of bribery,fraud, ethics violations and conspiracy in the tribe's $33.4million purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch in northern Arizona inJuly 1987.   Allegations that MacDonald personally profited from the ranchpurchase emerged in U.S. Senate subcommittee testimony earlier thisyear.   A second complaint alleges 25 violations of the Navajo electionlaw, including charges that MacDonald accepted $115,500 inundocumented cash and service constributions from non-Indians andcorporations.   A third charges MacDonald with 59 counts of bribery, extortion,fraud, ethics violations and conspiracy in alleged fradulentconsultant contracts MacDonald purportedly entered into withoutside businesses from November 1986 through 1989. Prosecutorsallege he pocketed over $300,000.   If convicted on all 111 counts, MacDonald could be sentenced to15 years in tribal jail and fined as much as $59,500.   MacDonald's son Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr. is charged withconspiracy in the ranch purchase in a fourth complaint and tribalVice Chairman Johnny R. Thompson is accused of ethics violations inthe fifth.   Prosecutors did not break down the complaints against Thompsonor the younger MacDonald.   Court officials said people listed in the complaint wouldprobably receive summonses from the Navajo Department of Justicewithin 14 days.   The special prosecutors, members of the Santa Fe, N.M., law firmof Rothstein, Bennett, Daly, Donatelli and Hughes, were appointedby the Tribal Council in March to ``investigate any possiblewrongdoing by former and current tribal officials,'' said tribalspokesman Duane Beyal.   MacDonald, speaking to reporters in this north-central Arizonacommunity shortly before the contents of the charges were disclosedin Window Rock, 150 miles southeast, said the charges would betrumped-up.   ``I don't care what it is, it's going to be a bunch of baloneyand whatever court it goes to it's going to be proven its a bunchof baloney,'' MacDonald said.   He reiterated his claim that the federal government wanted tooust him and other strong Indian leaders so it could have easieraccess to minerals and other natural resources on reservations.   ``We have made mistakes, I'm sure,'' MacDonald said. ``But wehave nowhere near as bad a record as whites have as our trustees inbringing poverty and hunger and illiteracy and alcoholism to nativeAmericans.   ``We have nowhere near the record of whites in stealing Indianland, Indian oil, Indian coal, Indian gas, and Indian water,'' hesaid.   Special prosecutor Robert Rothstein, who released the contentsof the complaint, said 75 to 100 people were investigated,including members of the administrations of MacDonald and interimChairman Leonard Haskie.   Haskie said the tribe appointed the prosecutors to ``protect thebest interest of the Navajo people'' and file charges if warranted.He said he had has asked the federal government to expedite itsinvestigation of MacDonald.   That probe focuses on allegations made during the Senatesubcommittee testimony in January that MacDonald and his familyprofited from the tribe's purchase of the 491,000-acre ranch.   The council put MacDonald on administrative leave with pay onFeb. 13. On March 10, it named Haskie interim chairman and placedThompson on leave.   MacDonald has said the 88-member council acted illegally byreplacing a chairman without a two-thirds majority, but tribalcourts have upheld the actions.   At his news conference, MacDonald declined to answer questionsabout past allegations.   ``I'm exercising my rights,'' he said when asked why he hadresisted turning over documents sought by tribal and federalinvestigators.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Allen Stooks of Phoenix did not return aphone call for comment on the status of the federal investigation.   The tribe purchased the Big Boquillas from Tracey Oil and GasCo., which had bought it a short time earlier from Tenneso West for$26.2 million.   The tribal complaint alleges that Tracey, Byron ``Bud'' Brown,the broker, and MacDonald agreed to divide the $7.2 million profitamong themselves.   It further alleges that MacDonald concealed the ranch's truevalue from the tribe and used his position as chairman to inflatethe ranch's appraised value, speed the sale and conceal hispersonal gain.   Earlier this year, the tribe filed suit in Maricopa CountySuperior Court in Phoenix, seeking to recover $24 million indamages from MacDonald and others in the ranch purchase.</TEXT></DOC>
