In its annual report, Ford said it is increasing its executive bonus pool to $250 million from $167 million in l986.    Ford's cash bonus payments far outstrip bonus awards at General Motors Corp., where 5,000 executives shared stock grants valued at $157 million under the company's new, stock-only bonus program. Ford also outearned GM last year: $4.63 billion to $3.55 billion. Chrysler Corp. hasn't yet disclosed its bonus payments.    Ford said 5,528 officials split $164.3 million in the 1986 bonus pool. A spokesman said Ford won't disclose the exact number of employees who will share in the 1987 plan until shareholders receive the company's proxy statement next month.    But the number of employees is expected to be about the same as a year earlier, which would make the average 1987 bonus about $45,000. That would be more than 10 times greater than the $3,700 average profit-sharing payment the company's hourly employees received earlier this month.    Ford held two news conferences to publicize the payments to its hourly workers, but the executive bonuses didn't get similar treatment. Instead, the amount was disclosed under a footnote titled &quot;Supplemental Compensation Plan&quot; on page 37 of the annual report.    The footnote said that the executive bonus set-aside was below the $363.9 million maximum that Ford's bonus formula would allow. The remaining $113.9 million, the footnote added, will be &quot;used in the company's business.&quot;    Ford is paying out a greater portion of its net income in executive bonuses for 1987 than it did the previous year -- 5.4% compared with 5.1%. </TEXT></DOC>
