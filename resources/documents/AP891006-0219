Also at the demonstration in the Burmese capital, he said,another woman student near him was struck in the head and as shereeled a second blow popped one of her eyes out.   Zaw Ye and other students then came to a conclusion: ``Werealized that no peaceful protests, debates or strikes would work.The only course is to resort to arms.''   He and his companions slipped from Rangoon after thatdemonstration in July and joined nearly 5,000 others who hadescaped earlier.   They are pledged to fight Burma's military government untildemocracy is won.   But democracy appears to have become a distant glimmer for themillions of Burmese who marched in the streets last year and facedthe blazing guns of soldiers who finally put down the uprising inSeptember 1988.   Since then a 17-member junta, the State Law and OrderRestoration Council, has wielded power. It has promised electionsnext May and is allowing more than 200 political parties to form,but it simultaneously has arrested several thousand dissidents andsilenced the main opposition leaders.   After the council took power, the first wave of about 10,000protesters, leaving wives and families behind, sought theprotection of ethnic minority rebels along Burma's rugged borderswith Thailand, India and China.   About half of them returned, however, enticed by a governmentpromise of amnesty and unable to put up with disease, malnutritionand other hardships. But the border movement did not falter as somehad predicted.   The military council initially tried to make amends with anangry population and refurbish its brutal image internationally. Itallowed the daughter of national hero Aung San to campaign and drawhuge crowds.   But in late July when protests broke out and speeches by AungSan's daughter Suu Kyi grew increasingly strident, the militarystruck again. She was placed under house arrest and martial law wastightened. The United States charged that political detainees werebeing tortured.   A second wave of dissidents fled to the frontiers, describingRangoon as a prison where people feared the military intelligenceand the nighttime knock on the door.   Today, the All Burma Students' Democratic Front claims amembership of more than 4,800 students, young professionals,Buddhist monks and others at 24 border camps. Compared to a yearago, they appear to be tougher and better organized but alsolargely forgotten by the rest of the world.   ``We have a rough journey ahead of us,'' said the front'sgeneral secretary, Than Win.   Some students contrast their own status to that of students whofled military repression in China in June. The Chinese are givenscholarships at U.S. and other universities and internationalplatforms to voice their protests. The few Burmese students whotried have had difficulties entering the United States, andrecently Thailand, eager for economic deals with the Burmesegovernment, expelled those who had crossed into its territory.   Life is marginal at camps like the one here at Mawke, a base for260 students who fight alongside the Karen National Union, one ofmany ethnic rebel armies struggling for greater autonomy in Burma.   Set in a forest near the Thai frontier, the camp is a collectionof crudely fashioned thatch huts, offering little protection frommonsoon rains. Two sleepers must sometimes share one blanket andthere are few mosquito nets. Leaders say 75 percent of the studentsoldiers have suffered from malaria; each can obtain only about$3.50 worth of food rations a month.   The Karen-trained students at Mawke have only about 100 weaponsof assorted makes and the ammunition they carry most likely wouldrun out in about 10 minutes of combat. They acknowledge they couldnot face a main force Burmese unit without Karen help.   Student leaders emphasize propaganda work in villages deeperinside Burma where they claim to be warmly received. Units pass outleaflets, give talks, entertain and help villagers clear trails,dig latrines and build small schools.   An hour's walk from Mawke, the student front has built a schoolfor its own members. Opened Aug. 1 as the ``Jungle University,''its staff of teachers and doctors who fled with the studentsteaches political science, English, Thai, basic medicine,agriculture and other subjects.   The students hope the U.S. Congress will pass legislation thatwould provide them up to $2.25 million worth of assistance tosupplement the meager funds they now receive from various Burmeseexile groups and other private donors.   The United States and much of the inernational community haveshunned Burma politically since last year but the militarygovernment has been able to attract some investors by opening thecountry to foreign businessmen for the first time in a quartercentury.   Critics charge that much of the badly needed foreign currencybeing earned goes to buy weapons for the fight against the ethnicminorities with whom the students are allied.   Although one Western diplomat based in Rangoon said that ``thestudents have been wrecked or driven to the border intoirrelevance,'' other analysts give more balanced assessments andthe student front sees itself at the forefront of the pro-democracyfight.   The front's chairman, Htun Aung Kyaw, said that despite thesweeping arrests of dissidents, the border camps can maintain linkswith underground, anti-government cells in Burma. Their own ranks,he said, could easily be swelled from the interior but this isdiscouraged because the camps could not cope with an influx.   ``We are young, brave and we are not selfish,'' the chairmanadded in an interview. ``Students are the only ones the peopletrust. We give the people inside courage and can tell the outsideworld what is happening in our country.''   Students have traditionally been at the cutting edge of Burmesepolitics and the front hopes to endow itself with the aura offuture leadership.   Last February, 30 student leaders met to seal their pledge toend authoritarian rule by drinking drops of their own blood mixedin a silver cup.   It was the same ritual Burma's nearly legendary ``ThirtyComrades'' went through during World War II when they pledged toliberate the country from the British.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 15</NOTE></DOC>
