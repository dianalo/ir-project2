But despite the electronics industry's enthusiasm for &quot;CD-Vs&quot; (the &quot;v&quot; stands for video), the new technology may be a tough sell.    In their most common form, CD-Vs will be five inches in diameter and will provide a five-minute music video and an additional 20 minutes of sound without video. (Eight-inch and 12-inch disks with a greater video capacity will also be available.) The total amount of music on the small CD-Vs is less than most audio disks contain. But prices for the new disks will probably start at less than $7, compared with $12 and up for audio disks.    To watch a CD-V, users will have to buy a CD-V player, which is wired between a television and an audio system. The simplest players will initially cost at least $600. So-called combination players -- which will play CD-Vs, regular compact disks and even laser-type videodisks -- are expected to list for $800 to $1,200.    The high price of the players, some retailers say, will severely limit buyers' acceptance of the new disks. Other retailers are worried that consumers will dismiss CD-Vs as conventional videodisks -- album-sized film disks that have never sold well. &quot;Could the CD-V format fall flat on its face like laser disks? Absolutely,&quot; says Robert Heiblim, the senior vice president for marketing at Denon America Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Nippon Columbia Co. of Japan.    But some industry executives believe CD-Vs can match the success of audio disks. Factories shipped $930.1 million of CDs last year, up from $103.3 million in 1984, their first full year on the market.    &quot;Clearly, there is a huge potential for the product,&quot; says Geoffrey Holmes, a vice president of Warner Communications Inc., a New York entertainment company.    Some music producers see CD-Vs as the best format to sell rock videos, now the bread-and-butter of the cable-TV music channel MTV. The new gold-colored disks, these producers say, may eventually replace the $200 million-a-year market in 45-rpm vinyl &quot;singles,&quot; which are used to introduce popular hits.    Meanwhile, movie producers see fiveinch CD-Vs as the perfect vehicle for &quot;trailers&quot; to promote their films and 12-inch CD-Vs as the best way to sell feature-length movies. Unlike most videodisks that have been on the market for several years, movies on CD-Vs will have high-quality digital sound. That feature, producers hope, will prompt people to buy films on CD-Vs rather than rent films on tape for videocassette recorders.    Indeed, some electronics retailers say they are looking for a new product to market in the wake of slowing VCR sales growth. The CD-V player is &quot;something we are very eager to sell,&quot; says Russ Solomon, the president of MTS Inc., the operator of the Tower Records retail chain.    Advertising will try to persuade audio customers that they are missing something. Declares the Humphrey Bogart lookalike in one promotional film, &quot;You know, compact disks always had the best sound, but something was missing: pictures.&quot;    The term &quot;CD-V&quot; was largely unknown in the electronics industry until last November. At that time, Polygram Records Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of N.V. Philips of the Netherlands, began pitching to other manufacturers the CD-V technology owned jointly by Philips and Sony Corp. of Japan.    By late April, more than two dozen music producers, movie companies and electronics manufacturers had agreed to heavily promote CD-Vs. Their first step was to reserve 6,000 square feet of exhibit space at a major consumer-electronics trade show to begin May 30 in Chicago.    &quot;There's a lot of marketing muscle behind CD-Vs,&quot; says Ron Balousek, the president of Technidisc Inc., a Troy, Mich., company that replicates CDs for record producers. He says production could be geared up quickly enough for CD-Vs to be widely available about four months from now. By the end of this month, Mr. Balousek says, CD-V makers will have produced demonstration copies of the first 300 or so titles to hit the market.    For example, Polygram Records, owned by Philips, is preparing a CD-V featuring the rock group Bon Jovi and their song &quot;Living on a Prayer.&quot; The album with that song has sold nine million copies, mostly cassettes.    Meanwhile, Philips and others, such as Sony, are preparing to market the players that consumers will need to play CD-Vs. &quot;There's going to be a lot of software,&quot; says Mr. Solomon of Tower Records. But &quot;it's not going to mean anything if there's no hardware on which to play it.&quot;    Despite such efforts, many retailers remain skeptical about the future of CD-Vs. &quot;We only have X amount of room to play with,&quot; says Dwight Montjar, the compactdisk buyer for Trans World Music Inc., an Albany, N.Y., operator of 212 music stores in 21 states. &quot;Here come new CD configurations, but where are we going to put them?&quot;    More important, perhaps, some avid buyers of standard audio disks are scoffing at CD-Vs. &quot;I like my music pure,&quot; says Miles M. Tepper, a 41-year-old New York lawyer with a CD player. &quot;I like to create my own images.&quot; Says Daniel M. Lauber, a 38-year-old urban-planning consultant and CD enthusiast in Evanston, Ill.: &quot;I certainly wouldn't buy a new player just to get video. That's a major expense for something that doesn't interest me.&quot; Besides the cost of a new player, individuals desiring the best possible CD-V pictures may also need to buy higher-quality TV sets or video monitors.    Because there are so many competing home-entertainment technologies, some electronics industry executives question whether CD-V proponents will support the new product as heavily as they have indicated. Skeptics are unsure how deeply Japanese electronics producers, the superpowers of the business, will commit themselves to the technology.    &quot;The confusion of the market is making it difficult to decide what to bring out,&quot; says Arch Luther, the senior staff scientist of SRI International's David Sarnoff Research Center, which is developing digital-videodisk technology for General Electric Co. Indeed, RCA Corp., before it was part of GE, lost more than $500 million on a non-laser videodisk system, now nearly as notorious as the Edsel.    Many Japanese companies still appear bent on selling digital audio tapes, or DATs, in the U.S. These high-quality tapes, some marketing specialists believe, could greatly reduce demand for all types of disks because of their ability to record as well as play. But the digital tapes have met with fierce resistance from U.S. music publishers, who say they would encourage piracy of copyright materials. A lobbying group here is seeking legislative curbs even before imports begin, and any curbs could help the market for CD-V.    &quot;It's harder to reproduce or pirate than a videotape,&quot; says Warren Lieberfarb, the president of Warner's home-video unit. For the software industry, he says, &quot;that's a major advantage.&quot;    ---                 Current vs. Coming                RETAIL TYPE           PRICE           CONTENTS 5-inch CD*    $10 to $14       Single side plays up to                                70 minutes of sound 5-inch CD-V   Under $7         Single side plays up to 5                                minutes of sound-plus-video                                and up to 20 minutes of                                sound only 8-inch CD-V   $12              One or two sides play up to                                22 minutes a side of sound-                                plus-video 12-inch CD-V  $18 to $20       One or two sides play up to                                60 minutes a side of sound-                                plus-video   *Currently the market standard   Source: North American Philips Corp., New York</TEXT></DOC>
