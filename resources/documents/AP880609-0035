The bill, adopted Tuesday, set the timetable for dismantling thefirst of Sweden's 12 reactors and established a mechanism fordeciding when to shut down the others within 21 years.   The bill passed with support of 160 of Parliament's 349legislators, but 70 others voted against and 82 abstained. The restwere absent.   Under the law, one reactor will close in the Barseback complexin southern Sweden and another in Ringhals on the western coast.   Swedes voted in a 1980 non-binding referendum to dismantlenuclear energy by the year 2010.   Though the power stations have proven safe and provided cheapelectricity, Energy Minister Birgitta Dahl said ``it is a matter ofhonor'' to keep the referendum's promise.   But doubts remain about the wisdom of the public's decision,taken in the heat of worldwide debate following the nuclearaccident at Three Mile Island. The plant near Harrisburg, Pa., wasdamaged in March 1979 after a combination of human and mechanicalerrors led to a partial meltdown of the nuclear core.   Sweden's first reactor was built in 1971, and the final two wereinstalled five years after the referendum.   Nuclear power provides half the energy needs of Sweden, acountry slightly larger than California with a population of 8.4million.   Dismantling the two reactors could cost $800 million and thenuclear plants will probably be replaced with coal or oil-firedstations, according to Vattenfall, the government's energy agency.   Swedes now pay about three cents per kilowatt hour, which meansan average household pays about $30 a month for electricity,including heating during the long, frigid winters.   Fear of expensive bills has prompted some industrialists and thelargest trade unions to voice reservations about eliminatingnuclear power.   Critics of the nuclear shutdown also say dirty, fossil-fuelenergy that replaces atomic power will threaten Sweden's pristineforests and hundreds of thousands of clear lakes.   But Sweden was hit badly by the 1986 Chernobyl accident, costingthe authorities $84 million to compensate reindeer herdsmen andfarmers for contamination and to counter other effects, said theRadiation Protection Board.   The government plans new investment in hydroelectric power, oil,gas and coal plants and in wind power. A government committee isinvestigating the possibility of placing hundreds of 300-foot-highwindmills off the island of Oland, in the Baltic Sea.</TEXT></DOC>
