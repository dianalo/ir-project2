Roth (R-Del.), GAO said it istoo early to assess accurately the actual effect of most actions taken.andM;The commission recommended 14 major changes to DOD's acquisition organizationand procedures that it said would cut the acquisition cycle for a weaponsystem in half.andM;It advocated a streamlined reporting structure for managers of major weaponsprograms, increased use of prototypes for the development of weapons,expanded use of commercial products and creation of alternate acquisitionpersonnel management systems.andM;One of the recommendations was for DOD to reduce its acquisition work force.andO;All three services have begun to reduce their acquisition staffs, in mostcases by merging internal organizations that were responsible for acquisitionmanagement activities.andP;  GAO is conducting an investigation of the personnelreductions.andM;Among other recommendations, the commission suggested federal procurementlaws be recodified into a single, simplified, governmentwide statute.andP;  TheOffice of Federal Procurement Policy responded with draft legislation thathas been reviewed by DOD and 26 agencies.andP;  Agency comments now are beingincorporated into the draft before it is submitted to Congress.andM;Responding to the commission's suggestion that a restructured JointRequirements and Management Board (JRMB) play an active role in all jointprograms and major services programs, DOD abolished the Defense SystemsAcquisition Review Council and replaced it with the JRMB.andP;  The DefenseAcquisition Board subsequently replaced JRMB.andM;The board serves as a forum to resolve issues, provide and obtain guidanceand make recommendations on acquisition issues.andP;  GAO found that the functionsand responsibilities of the board exceed those identified by the commission.andM;There appears to be a disconnection and some conflict between the board'sdecisions and the planning, programming and budgeting decisions of theDefense Resources Board, GAO said.andM;The commission suggested increased authority for the Defense secretary toestablish flexible personnel management policies and the creation of analternate personnel management system that includes senior acquisitionpersonnel and contracting officers, as well as scientists and engineers.andM;It also calls for professionalizing the civilian contracting career, andexpanding training and education opportunities.andP;  Work is progressing in theseareas.andM;The commission also refers to the new requirement established by the Officeof Personnel Management for 24 hours of business-related courses beforeentering the 1102 Contracting Series and plans to request that OPM makeadditional improvements in its qualification standards.andM;Additionally, DOD has drafted two directives, one of which appoints theDefense Systems Management College the executive agency for coordinating alleducation programs for defense acquisition personnel.andP;  The other consolidatesvarious directives into a single document establishing policies and guidancefor all defense acquisition education programs.andM;A draft manual outlining the career paths for acquisition personnel andrequired educational training for each position is being reviewed by theservices.andM;With the new Defense secretary in place, and Congress and the White Houseclamoring for procurement changes, this is the best opportunity thegovernment will get for full implementation of the commission'srecommendations.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
