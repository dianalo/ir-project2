above) and Oracle's recent entry into the fray,  IBM isenhancing its OS/2Extended Edition (EE) data management capabilities andclarifiying OS/2EE's relationship with its overall data management strategy.andM;OS/2EE Database Manager (DBM) is IBM's database management system (DBMS),targeted for the PS/2.andP;  It is packaged with the OS/2EE operating system,although it is not actually an integral part of the base operating system.andO;The DBM is installed separately, as is the Communications Manager, afterinstallation of the OS/2 Standard Edition operating system.andM;The OS/2EE DBM provides an SQL database server in the OS/2EE LAN environmentthat is essentially the equivalent of DB2 in the host environment (Seeillustration, page 18).andP;  some within IBM call the OS/2EE DBM &quot;micro Db2,&quot;describing it not as a subset of, but as a parallel to, DB2, OS/2EE DBMdevelopers worked closely with the DB2 developers in an effort to takeadvantage of DB2's architecture and to ensure that the two products willinteroperate effectively in the future.andP;  Since OS/2EE is the primary desktopplatform within SAA, and DB2 is IBM's flagship relational DBMS, the companyanticipates that there will be a high level and volume of interaction betweenthe two products.andP;  This partnership is particularly important as IBM enhancesits distributed database capabilities to work across SAA platforms.andP;  OS/2EEDBM can already interchange data with DB2 and SQL/DS on an import/exportbasis.andM;OS/2EE DBM is a fully compliant SAA DBMS, supporting the SAA SQL CPI, theCPIs for several SAA programming languages (C/2, Cobol/2, Fortran/2,Pascal/2, REXX/2), and the SAA Query CPI.andM;VERSION 1.2.andP;  Version 1.2 of OS/2EE, which will be available in March,includes the following enhancements to the Database Manager.andM;* Referential integrity, a new database function, is implemented via theability to specify primary and foreign keys when defining columns in a table.andO;One feature here that differs from DB2 is the fact that the OS/2EE DatabaseManager automatically builds an index based on the primary key.andP;  In DB2, thedeveloper must explicity build the index.andM;* Remote Data Services (RDS) has been added to allow the DBM to be used inIBM Token-Ring, IBM PC Network LAN, or Ethernet DIX Version 2.0 and IEEE802.3 environments (see illustration, page 19).andM;* A Database Application Remote Interface allows a developer to generate arequester/server application where some of the application processing (inaddition to database access) is executed on the server.andM;* Query Manager is now a Presentation Manager application and includes acallable interface (see illustration, page 19).andP;  This interface implementsthe SAA Query CPI and allows an application program to call Query Managerfunctions.andP;  Languages supported are C/2, Cobol/2, Pascal/2, Fortran/2, andREXX/2.andM;* REXX, (SAA Procedures Language) is included with OS/2EE and is supported byDBM for writing procedures.andP;  Commands include: do while loops, if/then/elselogic, and the ability to generate pop-up windows.andM;* SQL grant and revoke commands have been added to control user access todatabases and objects.andP;  There is also a new user profile management subsystemfor defining valid user IDs.andP;  Previously, database security was limited to alogon password.andM;* DBM can import DB2 and SQL/DS data without first defining a table with theOS/2 Query Manager.andP;  The import function pulls in the DB2 or SQL/DS tabledefinition as well as the data.andP;  The reverse does not yet work, although DBMdata can be exported to DB2 and SQL/DS.andP;  It is also not yet possible to shipqueries and reports back and forth between the PC and mainframe products.andP;  Wewould expect to see these enhancements implemented in the future.andM;* New levels of data isolation for concurrent access include cursor stabilityand uncommitted read.andP;  These are important for performance in a multiuser LANenvironment.andM;* Support for a business graphics interface.andP;  Data displayed in a QueryManager report can be passed to a business graphics application that iswritten to this interface.andM;DATABASE SERVICES.andP;  OS/2EE Database Services includes much of DB2'sfunctionality, scaled down where appropriate (e.g., maximum table size) tothe scope of the workstation platform and applications.andP;  However, it is afull-function DBMS with locking for concurrency control (across multiplebridged or interconnected LANs), logging, transaction management and recovery(implementing &quot;commit&quot; and &quot;rollback&quot; functions), an optimizer, indexing,referential integrity, and support for both static and dynamic SQL.andP;  Backupcan be performed for the entire database or only for changes.andP;  The datatypesin the OS/2 DBM are the same as those in DB2 and SQL/DS, with the exceptionof short-float data types.andP;  Import and export facilities cover a number of PCformats (e.g., Lotus WKS and WK1, ASCII delimited) in addition to DB2 andSQL/DS mentioned above.andP;  Another difference with DB2 is that OS/2 DBM lacksautomatic archiving, but IBM is aware of this requirement.andM;REMOTE DATA SERVICES.andP;  With RDS, multiple workstations (requesters) on a LANcan now access a common database located on a database server.andP;  Previously,the DBM was architected as a single-user system.andP;  RDS also supportsdistributed database access at the remote-unit-of-work level.andM;RDS uses the APPC programming interface of the Communications Manager; itdoes not use LAN Manager or LAN Server.andP;  In fact, the database server doesn'thave to be on the physical LAN server.andM;A DOS Database Requester allows access from a DOS workstation to a DBMdatabase on the OS/2EE database server.andP;  Supported LANs for DOS Requesterinclude.andP;  Token-Ring and IBM PC Network.andP;  Netbios is the communicationsprotocol.andP;  A DOS application has to be precompiled on an OS/2EE workstationand then compiled for DOS before it can be moved to DOS for execution.andM;QUERY MANAGER.andP;  Query Manager (QM) is very much like QMF (Query ManagementFAcility) on the S/370, but includes capabilities that are provided by otherproducts on the mainframe.andP;  In addition to generating queries and reports asQMF does, QM includes application tools built right in for the generation ofmenus, screens, procedures, and the ability to package simple applications.andO;The resulting applications are also CUA-compliant.andP;  Other options for writingapplications are to use a programming language or a third-party product as afront end for the DBM.andP;  Examples of third-party efforts underway are thosefrom Borland (Paradox) and Ashton-Tate (dBase IV).andM;The Query Manager provides a Presentation Manager windowed, promptedinterface to Database Services that does not require the direct use of SQL.andO;Also included in an online help function with an overal help index and theability to display and modify the SQL equivalent of a QM-prompted query.andO;Other capabilities are stored queries and the use of a custom form fordisplaying query results e.g., titles, number of fixed columns on a screendisplay, outline format for suppressing duplicate entries in a column,sixlevels of control breaks, aggregates, formats for displaying data in acolumn, multiline column headings).andM;The client front end to the IBM can be the DOS Database Requester mentionedabove, but this lacks the Query Manager.andP;  Therefore, the user needs anapplication program to access the database server, which further limits theusefulness and flexibility of DOS and access to the SAA environment.andP;  IBM hasnot yet ruled outthe possibility of putting Query Manager on DOS.andM;COMPETITION WITH SQL SERVER.andP;  IBM is obviously encouraging third-partyvendors are provide alternative front ends to the OS/2EE Database Services.andO;The SAA database and query CPIs make this a clear option.andP;  The question iswhether IBM will also encourage connection between its DBM and other databaseservers, such as the SQL Server from Ashton-Tate/Microsoft/Sybase.andO;Currently, there is no defined way to use any other SQL-based database serverinstead of the IBM.andM;For an in-depth view of IBM's data management strategy, see The OfficeComputing Report, V. 12, No.andP;
