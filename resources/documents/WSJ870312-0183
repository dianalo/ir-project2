The $39 million is only for the first fiscal year. In terms of secondary effects such as increased pension entitlements and eventual pay escalation for the about 5.2 million other incumbents (military and civilian) now on the federal payroll, this &quot;piddling&quot; raise could end up costing the taxpayer even more than the $20 billion Clean Water Bill.
