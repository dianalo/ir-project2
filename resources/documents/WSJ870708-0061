Alfred A. Molinari Jr., president, said analysts have been estimating that the company earned about $735,000, or 23 cents a share, on sales of about $7.8 million to $8 million in the fiscal second quarter. A year earlier, the company earned $509,000, or 17 cents a share, adjusted for a 4-for-3 stock split paid Jan. 8. Sales were $5.6 million.    The company makes add-ons for personal computers used in data acquisition, image processing and array processing. The image processing business, which the company entered two years ago, has tripled in the past year, Mr. Molinari said.    Between 40% and 50% of Data Translation's products are used in International Business Machines Corp. personal computers, or IBM compatible machines. Mr. Molinari said the company is designing products for the IBM PS/2 line of personal computers, as well as for Apple Computer Co.'s new Macintosh II.    To penetrate big companies, Data Translation hired its first salesman, in Northern California, two months ago and plans to add more in Texas and the Midwest in the next few months.    The company, which does about 40% of its business overseas, also plans to open a sales and service subsidiary in West Germany by the end of December and another in Japan in calendar year 1988. Data Translation's 300 different products are manufactured in the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
