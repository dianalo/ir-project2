A previously unknown group issued a claim ofresponsibility.   Jack Mann, 83, a former pilot with Lebanon's national airline,left his apartment on foot at 11 a.m. Friday and headed for theBritish Bank of the Middle East about 12 blocks away, said hiswife, Sunny.   Employees at the bank say he never got there.   The Foreign Office in London confirmed in a statement that Mann,a former Royal Air Force squadron leader, has disappeared in Beirut.   A group calling itself The Cells of Armed Struggle issued aclaim of responsibility in a statement handwritten in Arabic anddelivered Friday to a Western news agency.   The group did not mention the name of the Briton, but demandedthe release of comrades jailed in connection with the killing of aPalestinian cartoonist in London in 1987.   An editor at the news agency, requesting anonymity, said theagency did not report the claim because there were no indicationsthen that a Briton was missing.   The statement said: ``We declare our readiness to immediatelyrelease the captive if the British government announces thebeginning of a fair trial for our comrades.   ``We ask the British government to release our comrades detainedwithout evidence on charge of assassinating comrade Naji al-Ali,''it said.   Naji Ali, whose real name is Ali Naji Adhami, died Aug. 30,1987, from wounds he suffered five weeks earlier when a loneasassin shot him outside the London offices of the Kuwaitinewspaper Al-Qabas. An investigation was launched into the killing,but it was not known if any arrests have been made.   The Cells of Armed Struggle claimed the Palestinian cartoonist``died at the hands of the (Israeli secret service) Mossad incooperation with the British intelligence to drive a wedge anddeepen differences within Palestinian ranks.''   Mann is a retired Royal Air Force pilot who later worked forMiddle East Airlines, Lebanon's national airliner.   ``I don't know for sure if he's been kidnapped, but I presumeso,'' Mrs. Mann said.   A friend of Mann's, speaking on condition of anonymity, said hesaw the missing Briton at about 11:15 a.m. Friday near the bank.   ``I remember he had blue trousers and was walking slowly in thedirection of the bank,'' the friend said.   An employee at the British Bank of the Middle East said he didnot arrive.   After his retirement in the early 1960s, Mann worked for 10years as a bartender at the Pickwick Pub in west Beirut.   Mrs. Mann recently appeared in a program on foreigners living inLebanon screened by the state television.   Asked why she and her husband continued to live in thiskidnap-plagued city, Mrs. Mann said: ``We've been living here for along, long time. We feel this is our home. We're not going toleave.''   The suspected abduction comes after Hashemi Rafsanjani, speakerof Iran's Parliament, urged Palestinians on May 5 to launch aworldwide campaign of terror against Britons, Americans and French.Rafsanjani later said his remarks were misinterpreted.   On May 4, three West German relief workers were captured inBeirut and two were released 10 hours later. The third, MarkusQuint, is being held by unidentified kidnappers who are demandinglenient sentences or freedom for prominent Palestinian terrorists,the other two hostages said.   No direct claim of responsibility is known to have been receivedin that case.   Fifteen other Western hostages are believed held by Moslemfundamentalists, most of them loyal to Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeini's Islamic government in Iran. The hostages include fourBritons, nine Americans, a Belgian and an Italian.   Longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 41, of Lorain, Ohio, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He waskidnapped in west Beirut March 16, 1985.   Relations between Tehran and London were severed in Februaryafter Khomeini issued an edict calling on Moslems to kill Britishwriter Salman Rushdie. Many Moslems believe Rushdie's novel ``TheSatanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam.</TEXT></DOC>
