The Star reporter Barry Levine said the craft came under fire asit circled a ranch eight miles west of Aspen, Colo., during Monday'sprivate ceremony.   Local and federal authorities said the helicopter was hit by whatappeared to be buckshot, usually fired by skeet shooters.   Mintz acknowledged that some guests were shooting skeet beforethe wedding, but he said the control tower at Aspen Airport wasalerted to that.   Levine, 30, and photographer Ross Truiak, 44, were slightlywounded, apparently by buckshot, said Tom Stephenson, sheriff'sdeputy in Pitkin County, Colo. ``A number of shotgun pellets havebeen found within the cockpit of the helicopter.''   And Pitkin County Sheriff Bob Braudis said Thursday thatinvestigators doubt there was a serious attempt to shoot down thehelicopter. He said there is little chance the person firing theshots ever will be identified.</TEXT><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Actor Omar Sharif finished out of the money in abridge tournament bearing his name, but it wasn't as unpleasant anexperience as a previous visit to Dallas.
