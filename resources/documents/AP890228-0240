In a separate rulings, the court also made it easier for theUnited States to turn over tax records to foreign governments.   The TWA ruling allows more than 1,220 new flight attendants hiredduring a 1986 strike by the Independent Federation of FlightAttendants to keep their jobs but fails to reinstate more than 2,000former striking attendants who demanded their jobs back.   Justice William J. Brennan denounced the 6-3 ruling saying it``is inherently destructive of the right to strike'' and that itfavors so-called cross-over workers _ those who cross picket lines.   But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority, saidsuch a policy ``of encouraging pre-strike workers to remain on thejob during the strike or to abandon the strike and return to workbefore all vacancies were filled'' is a legitimate ``exercise ofTWA's peaceful economic power.''   The ruling is based on an interpretation of the federal RailwayLabor Act, which also governs airlines.   In the tax case, which involved a 1942 tax treaty with Canada,the Supreme Court granted Canadian officials access to the financialrecords of two of its citizens with bank accounts in Washingtonstate.   In the 9-0 decision, the Supreme Court said a federal law aimedat protecting criminal suspects who also are being investigated bythe Internal Revenue Service does not apply to tax probes by foreigngovernments.   In 1987, the 9th U.S. Court of Appeals had blocked an effort bythe IRS to obtain records of Philip Stuart and Mons Kapoor on behalfof the Canadian Department of National Revenue. Canada's DNR, theequivalent of the IRS, had requested the documents under the taxtreaty providing for exchange of information between the two nations.   U.S. government officials had criticized the appeals rulingsaying it could affect U.S. treaty obligations with several foreigngovernments and impair the ability of U.S. investigators to obtainforeign financial records.   The TWA case stemmed from a dispute between the airline and theIFFA, who called a strike on March 7, 1986, after contractnegotiations broke down. The previous contract had expired July 31,1984.   TWA hired the new flight attendants after the strike began. Inaddition, some 1,280 TWA flight attendants crossed picket lineseither at the outset of the walkout or as the strike continued formore than two months.   After the strike ended, the union filed a federal lawsuitcharging TWA with illegally refusing to reinstate more than 2,000striking workers.   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1987 that strikingflight attendants were entitled to their old jobs at the expense ofless senior flight attendants who had crossed the picket lines.   O'Connor said that preferential treatment for cross-overs doesnot violate seniority protections because workers who stayed out onstrike but were reinstated after the walk-out ended retain theirseniority rights over cross-overs with less seniority.</TEXT></DOC>
