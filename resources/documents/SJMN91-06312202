That's whereit's picked up,&quot; Barrett said.;   As the years go by, Barrett said, they fallfurther behind. Once in the working world, they fake their way along, oftengiving up promotions or better-paying jobs because they can't read.;   &quot;Wehave a guy who's been in the program a couple of years now. He lost his job asa welder because he couldn't deal with the added responsibility that his bosswanted to give him,&quot; Barrett said.;   &quot;After he'd taken tutoring for a time,he decided he wanted to be a truck driver. He passed the DMV test, got throughtruck driver's school and passed their test. He's still in the readingprogram.&quot;;   Asking for help is probably the biggest challenge for non-readersbecause &quot;it requires a lot of maturity to pull it off.&quot; Most applicants areover 30 and have seen some difficult times, Barrett said.;   Non-readerstrying to hurdle job-related obstacles aren't the only learners in theprogram. Others want to read to their children or simply want to improve thequality of their own life, Barrett said.;   Countywide, some 400 adultnon-readers are being tutored at a given time. About 50 of them are in SouthCounty, Barrett said.;   Tutors are asked to stay with the program for atleast six months.;   The program for children began at P.A. Walsh School inMorgan Hill in the spring and started this fall at Jordan School in Gilroy. Itrequires 30 to 45 minutes once a week.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The Santa ClaraCounty Library reading program will train adult tutors and people interestedin reading to children from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Nov. 16 and 23.
