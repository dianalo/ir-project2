The bond market's benchmark security, the latest 30-yearTreasury bond, fell about 5/8-point yesterday, a loss ofabout $6.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue'syield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price,rose to 7.51% from 7.46% on Friday. Since Thursday, the priceof the benchmark bond has fallen about 1 5/8 points. Pricesof short-term securities also were hit hard as investors andtraders adjust to the perception that the Federal Reserve isunlikely to further ease monetary policy soon.</LP><TEXT>   That notion gained acceptance Friday, when Decemberemployment data pointed to the possibility that the seeds ofeconomic recovery were starting to sprout.   &quot;We haven't seen three consecutive down days in the bondmarket since Nov. 19,&quot; said William Sullivan, director ofmoney market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., whoexpects more declines in the future. &quot;We'd been going up in astraight line for several weeks in a row, and a lot of moneyhas been invested.&quot;   Traders and analysts said Treasury notes and bonds havesuffered more than other fixed-income securities asinvestors, seeking higher-yielding alternatives, move out ofTreasurys and into other securities.   &quot;We saw a lot of money moving out of Treasurys and intocorporate bonds and stocks,&quot; Mr. Sullivan said.   Last week, nearly $11 billion of new corporate bonds wassold to investors, making it one of the busiest weeks inseveral years. The fast pace of new corporate issuancecontinued yesterday as nearly $1.5 billion of corporate notesand bonds was sold. One of the biggest issuers was FederalHome Loan Mortgage Corp., which sold $300 million ofseven-year debentures priced to yield 6.86% via underwritersat First Boston Corp.   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, intestimony Friday before a joint meeting of the Senate Bankingand Budget Committees, contended that the Fed had done enoughto get the economy moving again.   David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co.,said Mr. Greenspan's testimony suggested that the Fed hasfinished easing for this phase of the economic cycle unlessthe economy shows signs of deteriorating.   Mr. Jones says the market appears to be entering aconsolidation phase in which the 30-year Treasury bond yieldwill fluctuate in the upper part of the band from 7.25% to7.75%. &quot;In some sense, we're past the period of best possiblenews for bonds,&quot; he contends.   Signs that the economy might have slipped back intorecession in the fourth quarter, along with lower inflationand expectations of more Federal Reserve easing all haveserved to push note and bond prices higher.   But the environment that was beneficial to bonds appearsto be changing, says Mr. Jones. He says that the employmentreport presages some kind of rebound in the spring, that oilprices have turned sharply higher the past two tradingsessions and that Mr. Greenspan has suggested thatpolicymakers have provided more than enough monetary stimulusfor a recovery.   Nevertheless, the fundamental backdrop for interest ratesis still bullish, many investors say, given what is stillseen as a benign inflation outlook, which Mr. Greenspanhimself took pains to accentuate in his testimony Friday.   But for the time being, some say, the perception is thatthe bond market has come too far, too fast. &quot;People just gotcarried away to an extreme,&quot; says one trader.   Ward McCarthy, managing director of Stone andamp; McCarthyResearch Associates, says the failure of the 30-year bond tostay above a price of 106, a level that it has tested but notpenetrated in recent weeks, is &quot;not going to helppsychology.&quot;   Traders say the declines in note and bond prices the pastthree sessions are in part a corrective phase that will cometo a halt when investors decide securities are cheap enoughto start buying again.   One result of the recent sell-off has been a flattening ofthe yield curve, as short-term rates have risen more thanlong-term rates. The 30-year bond yield was only 2.58percentage points above the two-year note yesterday, comparedwith 2.63 points Friday and as much as 2.77 percentage pointsWednesday.   On today's economic calendar is a report from the CommerceDepartment on December retail sales. Economists surveyed byDow Jones Capital Markets Report forecast, on average, thatthe report will show retail sales fell 0.3% after rising 0.3%in November.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasurys moved lower for the third consecutive day.   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at 105 23/32to yield 7.51%, compared with 106 8/32 to yield 7.46%.   Among shorter-term securities, the latest two-year notesended at 100 3/32 to yield 4.93%, compared with 100 9/32 toyield 4.83%.   Meanwhile, the Treasury sold $20.51 billion of short-termnotes at its regular weekly auction. The average discountrate was 3.83% on new three-month bills and 3.87% onsix-month bills.   The rate on three-month bills was down slightly from lastweek's auction, when it was 3.85%. The rate on six-monthbills was up slightly from last week's auction when the ratewas 3.86%.                                                                                                                             TREASURY BILLS                                                                                                          Here are the details of yesterday's auction by theTreasury of 13-week and 26-week bills:   Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value.

The 13-week billsmature April 16, 1992, and the 26-week bills mature July 16,1992.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          New notes and bonds continued to roll off the assemblyline even as interest rates lurched higher.   Nearly $1.5 billion of debt was sold in the public debtmarkets yesterday as a number of corporations, including someutilities, visited the financing arena.   In addition to Federal Home Loan Mortgage, the largestborrower of the day, issuers included Polaroid Corp., theFlorida Power andamp; Light Co. subsidiary of FPL Group Inc.,Central Illinois Light Co. and Puget Sound Power andamp; Light Co.   Two banks, J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. and Bankers Trust New YorkCorp., which raised money in the credit markets last week,were back yesterday.   Bankers Trust offered $200 million of 10-year subordinatednotes priced to yield 7.59%. J.P. Morgan, meanwhile, sold$250 million of three-year notes at a yield of 5.452%, or0.20 percentage point above the comparable Treasury.   Utilities were among the big borrowers, and some analystsexpect the trend will continue. &quot;I suspect this is going tobe a very aggressive year for electric utilities to finance,&quot;said Dan Scotto, a utility analyst and director offixed-income research at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; JenretteSecurities Corp. &quot;A lot of these companies are finding awhole new layer of debt to refinance&quot; because of the declinein interest rates.   In addition, Mr. Scotto expects that reducing interestexpense is one of the ways utilities will look to improveprofitability, especially in a tough economic environment.   In the secondary market for investment-grade corporatedebt, prices of most high-grade bonds ended 1/4 to 3/8 pointlower in sympathy with U.S. Treasury securities.   In the junk bond market, R.H. Macy andamp; Co. continued toslump after registering sharp losses Friday. The latestsetback for Macy bonds came after Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.lowered its ratings on Macy's subordinated debt totriple-C-minus from triple-C-plus. About $1.9 billion ofrated debt is affected, the rating agency said. The impliedsenior debt rating is triple-C-plus, Sandamp;P said. Sandamp;P said thedowngrading reflects Macy's &quot;weaker-than-anticipatedperformance during the crucial Christmas season, leading tonear-term liquidity pressures.&quot;   Macy's bonds began to sink last last week on reports thatthe large retailer has delayed an expected payment tosuppliers. Rumors about the delay sent prices of Macy bondssharply lower Friday.   In trading yesterday, the zero-coupon bonds lost threepoints to end at 20.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          Yields on some New York state general obligation bondsrose as much as 0.05 percentage point, partly on news thatStandard andamp; Poor's Corp. lowered the rating on the bonds tosingle-A-minus from single-A.   However, yields on some lower-rated New York stateappropriation-backed bonds rose as much as 0.12 percentagepoint from levels seen last week on the rating agency'sone-notch downgrade of those issues. The 0.12 percentagepoint increase is equal to a price decline of about onepoint.   Dealers also attributed a portion of the price declines onthe New York state general obligation andappropriation-backed bonds to overall weakness in thetax-exempt market, where prices fell as much as 3/8 point.   Among New York issues, an offering of New York StateDormitory Authority bonds, the 7.375% issues of 2014, tradedat about a 7.17% yield, dealers said.   Last week, the bonds, issued on behalf of State Universityof New York, were offered at yields in the 7.05% range,dealers said.   Sandamp;P lowered the rating on a number of New York StateDormitory Authority issues to triple-B from triple-B-plus.   In downgrading New York state's ratings, Sandamp;P pointed to&quot;chronic operating deficits&quot; and &quot;the legislative stalematein seeking permanent and structurally sound fiscaloperations.&quot; About $4.8 billion of general obligation bondsis affected by the rating downgrade, Sandamp;P said.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Prices of mortgage securities fell sharply.   In trading, Government National Mortgage Association 7.5%securities for January delivery fell 23/32 to 99 11/32,Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Gold 7.5% securities dropped24/32 to 98 14/32, and Federal National Mortgage Association7.5% securities slumped 25/32 to 98 8/32.   Despite the trend in trading, new real estate mortgageinvestment conduit issuance remained heated as underwritersannounced $1.75 billion of new Remics in three Fannie Maeofferings.   Prices of most Remic classes are tied to short-termTreasury yields. And as the yield curve flattens andshort-term rates rise more steeply than bond yields, Remicissuance becomes less attractive. Underwriters are likely tostep up issuance before the curve flattens much further,traders say.   The three Fannie Mae Remics announced yesterday useddiverse collateral.   The $750 million Fannie Mae series 1992-19 was backed bythe agency's 8% mortgage securities; the $500 million series1992-20 was collateralized with Fannie Mae 15-year 8%mortgage securities; and the $500 million series 1992-21 wasbacked by Fannie Mae stripped 8% mortgage securities fromStripped Mortgage-Backed Securities Trust 120.</TEXT></DOC>
