Unlike run-of-the-mill varieties, Calgene's gene-splicedtomato, named the Flavr Savr, includes a gene calledantisense polygalacturonase that blocks the production of anenzyme in tomatoes that causes them to soften and rot.   Grocery-store tomatoes are often picked while green andfirm so that they won't be damaged in shipping. But consumersgrumble that these tomatoes -- often bred specifically forfirmness rather than flavor -- aren't as tasty asvine-ripened fruit.   Tomato farmers can pick Calgene's genetically alteredfruit when it is vine ripe and yet ship them cheaply, Calgenesaid, because the tomato can last about 15 days betweenpicking and consumption, or about 50% longer than normaltomatoes.   Calgene developed the Flavr Savr gene with funding, inpart, from a research institute of Campbell Soup Co., Camden,N.J. Calgene said yesterday that it had acquired fromCampbell the rights to license the gene in fresh tomatoes formarketing in North America. Campbell owns the right to usethe gene in processing tomatoes, used in paste, sauce andjuice, Calgene said.   Calgene expects that regulators will officially call itstomatoes &quot;food&quot; by the end of 1992, Daniel Wagster, Calgene'schief financial officer, said. The company plans in 1993 tobegin marketing genetically engineered tomatoes grown undercontract by farmers.</TEXT></DOC>
