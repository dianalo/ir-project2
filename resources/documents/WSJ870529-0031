Lewis Tambs said as ambassador he received his first instructions concerning the effort from Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, but understood that the former White House aide was speaking for representatives of the CIA and State Department. Mr. Tambs said it was his &quot;conviction&quot; that the local CIA station chief with whom he worked closely was reporting to superiors in the agency and within the State Department. And he said Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams knew about the operation.    Mr. Tambs appeared before House and Senate committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair as they broadened their inquiry beyond the White House to the role of other administration officials in helping the Contras during the two-year period that Congress banned U.S. military aid to the Nicaraguan insurgents.    Apart from providing new details about his own involvement and the construction of a covert landing strip in Costa Rica, Mr. Tambs's account laid the groundwork for a closed-door examination today of the CIA station chief who has been recalled from Costa Rica, and for subsequent testimony by Mr. Abrams.    The white-haired former ambassador -- now a history professor in Arizona -- was often blunt in his remarks, and demonstrated little concern that his activities might have violated restrictions during his tenure. &quot;When you take the king's shilling, you do the king's bidding,&quot; Mr. Tambs testified. He was equally short in recounting instructions he received from Col. North before assuming his post in Costa Rica in July 1985. &quot;Col. North asked me to go down and open up the southern front,&quot; Mr. Tambs said.    Mr. Tambs said it was his &quot;understanding&quot; that Col. North was speaking on behalf of an interagency group that included Mr. Abrams. He said that only months later, he had a brief conversation in Panama with the assistant secretary related to the operation. &quot;It was obvious to me,&quot; said Mr. Tambs, recalling the meeting, &quot;that he knew as much about it as I did.&quot;    Mr. Abrams has said he doesn't recall that discussion, according to Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii), chairman of the Senate investigating committee. Mr. Abrams last night refused to comment, but an aide said that the assistant secretary had never authorized Mr. Tambs's involvement in the military supply network. &quot;He made a lot of assumptions,&quot; the aide said of Mr. Tambs, &quot;and didn't check the regular channels.&quot;    In 1985, the administration was eager to build a southern front for the Contras, both to relieve military pressure on forces in the north and to find some substitute for the independent-minded Eden Pastora, who was leading forces opposed to the Nicaraguan government near the country's southern border with Costa Rica. The covert airlift overseen by Col. North in 1985 and 1986 ultimately was focused on this effort.    During Mr. Tambs's tenure, an airstrip was built in Costa Rica for refueling supply planes. The work was financed through one of a series of Panamanian corporations controlled by retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, but Mr. Tambs said under the agreement negotiated with the San Jose government, the property was to be deeded eventually to Costa Rica.    The former ambassador said he later was surprised when Col. North outlined a scheme whereby the property would be sold to the CIA, and he admitted to some frustration with periodic violations of the agreement covering use of the strip. Planes landing there were supposed to be empty after completing their supply-runs, yet he recalled an aircraft becoming bogged down in the mud under its load of arms.    The Costa Rica airstrip was closed when a new government came to power in that country in the spring of 1986, but Mr. Tambs said that in at least one case after that, the embassy helped to facilitate the refueling of a plane that had run arms to the insurgents.    Mr. Tambs said his CIA counterpart in Costa Rica, identified by a prior witness as &quot;Joe,&quot; worked secretly on the supply effort with officials in Washington, including Col. North. The ambassador pointedly defended the station chief, who has been criticized within the CIA for exceeding his authority. &quot;The field officers who went forward are not being backed up by the superiors who gave the orders,&quot; Mr. Tambs said.    The ambassador's testimony came after the committees finished their cross-examination of Felix Rodriguez, a former CIA operative who assisted in the supply effort, but fell into a bitter feud with the Secord network in 1986. A veteran of military and covert operations in Central America and Vietnam, the Cuban-born witness was hailed by some lawmakers as a warrior against Communism, but the substance of his testimony was often thin and based more on his suspicions than first-hand information.    Mr. Rodriguez denied any knowledge of the diversion of profits from U.S. weapon sales to Iran. But he was unable to explain why notes taken of a briefing he gave last August to an aide of Vice President George Bush said that &quot;a swap of weapons for $ was arranged to get aid for Contras.&quot; The handwritten notes were taken by Donald Gregg, a security adviser to Mr. Bush, but under questioning by Sen. George Mitchell (D., Maine), Mr. Rodriguez said he couldn't recall why the aide wrote that.    However vague, Mr. Rodriguez's criticism of the Secord operation won sympathy within the committees. New documents released yesterday provide details of excessive charges by associates of the retired Air Force general in the airlift.    Individual pilots and crew members were being paid in the range of $3,000 to $4,000 a month. But apart from equipment and travel charges, total personnel fees listed on a March 1986 invoice from a Virginia company used in the operation amounted to $61,992. Even if all 11 individuals listed were paid $4,000 for that month, the billing exceeded total salaries by more than 40%.    Such fees later were reduced as the operation was brought under tighter management by retired Air Force Col. Robert Dutton, who has acknowledged that some of the earlier charges were excessive. An attorney for retired Air Force Lt. Col. Richard Gadd, who controlled the company in question, declined to comment yesterday, but it has been estimated that companies controlled by Col. Gadd earned around $100,000 on the airlift. </TEXT></DOC>
