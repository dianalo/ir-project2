 It has been two years since we introduced theconcept of the &quot;fourth wave&quot; of publishing technology.andP;  We think it is nowclear: effective systems for professional publishing can be built using manyoff-the-shelf hardware and software parts.andM;But combining those parts is a challenge.andP;  Who should do it?andP;  Is thepublisher in a position to take on this task, or must it be left to aprofessional system vendor?andM;Some publishers are diving right in and putting together systems on theirown.andP;  This approach was enthusiastically presented by several Seminarsparticipants (most notably Tamara Westmark of Entertainment Weekly) and itspros and cons were debated heavily.andM;There are, however, applications for which few publishers can reasonablydevelop off-the-shelf systems on their own.andP;  Alice Imregh of Atex carried thetorch for this view, using the example of the enormous complexity of handlingdozens of geographic and demographic editions of a metropolitan newspaper.andM;Publishers are making decisions both ways.andP;  A variety of factors can sway adecision toward either an outside supplier or an in-house approach.andP;  Here arethree of the most important ones.andM;* The technical sophistication of in-house staff.andP;  Large newspapers oftenhave highly skilled technical staffs, so they often take on projects thatother publishers could not.andM;* The scope and difficulty of the application.andP;  A publisher that would takeon the automation of a three-person publicity department as an in-houseproject might turn instead to an outside supplier to automate a 30-personcatalog publishing team.andM;* The type of support desired.andP;  Keeping a home-grown publishing systemrunning requires a long-term investment in technical staff and ongoingtraining programs.andP;  Many publishers would rather call on outside source forsupport when needed.andM;System vendors in do-it-yourself worldandM;Givens poses the challenge.andP;  It has never been easy for a vendor in thisindustry to turn a profit, and these days it is harder than ever.andP;  Thismessage was eloquently delivered at the Seminars by Bill Givens, president ofECRM.andP;  According to his estimates, annual sales of traditional electronicprepress systems, including color systems, are about $ 2.7 billion.andP;  There isessentially no net growth: companies experiencing sales growth are balancedby those whose sales are dropping.andP;  Profits are typically low, and losses arecommon.andM;The &quot;fourth wave&quot; has not helped with these problems, Givens said, becausefourth-wave systems cannot yet handle the production volumes thatprofessional publishing requires.andP;  This is especially true where graphics areinvolved.andP;  And yet, the low prices of off-the-shelf products have arousedexpectations that production-level tools will soon be available at low cost.andO;This isn't likely to happen, Givens feels.andP;  Inexpensive solutions may let you&quot;plug and pay,&quot; but they won't let you &quot;plug and be productive.&quot;andM;Givens painted a gloomy picture of high-end users deferring purchases andtrying out off-the-shelf solutions while high-end vendors--who haveproductive systems to offer-see their sales dwindling.andP;  (ECRM, it was noted,is an exception: it is experiencing healthy growth.)andM;Jim Lennane, founder of SII, later added another reason for vendors' gloom:the high cost of supporting existing users, which, Lennane says, the endusers are unwilling to bear directly.andM;Givens's tone was somber, and for good reason.andP;  His presentation implicitlyposed the challenge to each vendor: what makes you think your company will besuccessful in an industry where, on average, most companies are scrapingalong?andP;  What special stategy do you have that will set you apart from thepack?andM;There was some controversy regarding Givens's view, but in one respect he isdead-on: the heyday of large professional vendors is over.andP;  The newspapermarket is saturated, and in other markets the requirements are so diversethat it will be virtually impossible for any publishing vendor to dominateexcept in vertical niches.andM;How about the desktop market?andP;  Givens addressed his remarks to high-endprofessional publishing suppliers.andP;  But could these problems be confined tothe high-end vendors?andP;  What about the next level down and the desktopplayers?andP;  Aren't they doing well?andM;If you were looking for reassurance from that quarter, you wouldn't havefound it in the presentations of the next two speakers, one representing thedesktop and the other, a level above it.andM;Gill: Desktop cannot do it all.andP;  Tim Gill, the founder of Quark and thearchitect of Quark Xpress, made it clear that there are definite limits towhat professional users can expect from mass-market software.andM;Quark, Aldus and Letraset have all been locked in a features race.andP;  But thereis a limit to how much sophistication (and complexity) one can pack into aprogram that sells for $695, must appeal to a broad market and must be ableto run on low-end as well as high-end personal computers.andM;Gill does not believe that it is reasonable to expect a mass-market productto include all of the nuances and special features that might be required tomeet the needs of every market niche.andP;  This is why Quark created a mechanismto allow companies that serve specialist markets to create and marketapplication-specific Xtensions to the base Xpress product.andM;Gill suggested three possibilities for future development: documentmanagement, workgroup publishing and color.andP;  He gave little hint of whereQuark would go, but the last area is likeliest to receive attention.andM;Most desktop vendors hope that document management will be handled bycomputer system vendors or by higher-end vendors that focus on solvingspecific industry needs.andP;  Likewise, all of the desktop publishing vendorsrely on network suppliers (Novell, 3Com, Microsoft and Apple) to solve issuesrelating to work groups.andM;Desktop color publishing is about to take off as color, plain-paper laserprinters enter the market.andP;  Color is still within the realm of the desktoppublishing application, and it is unlikely to be addressed at the systemlevel.andM;Even with the growth of color publishing, though, Gill was skeptical thatQuark can continue its rapid growth.andP;  Although the personal computer industryexpects software vendors to find more new customers each year than they foundthe year before, there must be some limit to the number of people who can usea program such as Quark Xpress.andM;Gill believes that there is a market for more user training and support, butit may not make sense for a mass-market software supplier to attempt to moveinto the custom system integration business.andP;  In short: expect companies likeQuark to provide effective software packages with broad appeal and to make iteasy for other people to add to these packages and to incorporate them intosystems.andP;  Do not expect the desktop publishing vendors to be the systemsuppliers of the '90s.andM;Boucher: tailored documents.andP;  David Boucher, founder and CEO of Interleaf,struck on Gill's theme of service and support.andP;  He contended that in the1990s the market will demand an unprecedented level of software integrationand customization services.andP;  Features are no longer the issue, said Boucher,echoing Gill's comments.andP;  To add value, companies will have to offersolutions that are highly customized to user requirements.andM;Unlike Gill, who said such customization is antithetical to off-the-shelfsoftware, Boucher discussed his firm's strategy of developing a base-leveltechnology that can be customized.andP;  That customization may be done by theuser or the supplier, but it will inevitably be the supplier that offers theexpertise required to make a customized solution work.andM;Afterward, Boucher was asked whether this new strategy doesn't represent asupport nightmare for Interleaf.andP;  Boucher sidestepped the question, but infact it does.andP;  Small companies, and even medium-sized ones like Interleaf,lack the resources to offer hand-holding to every customer.andP;  This isparticularly true of Interleaf, which recently has been losing millions ofdollars despite modest increases in sales.andM;The fact that so many system suppliers have found it hard to make money isone of the reasons why a number of them have been willing (even eager) to beacquired by large corporations such as Du Pont, Agfa and Kodak.andP;  However, aswe will discuss in a moment, some people are convinced that despite (or evenbecause of) their &quot;deep pockets&quot; these large companies are not well suited toprovide focused system solutions.andM;Taken together, the message that Gill and Boucher delivered was this: thoughdesktop publishing has been a high-growth market, it may now be approaching aplateau.andP;  Support activities will be increasingly important compared withsales to new customers.andP;  It sounds as if even the desktop market may beevolving toward the sluggish equilibrium described by Givens.andP;  Desktopvendors, too, will have to come up with an answer to Givens's challenge.andM;Making money the old-fashioned wayandM;How then does one make money?andP;  Two very successful enterpreneurs addressedthe issue at the seminar: Jim Lennane, founder of System Integrators, andDoug Drane, cofounder of Atex.andM;Work hard and focus on customer needs.andP;  Both Lennane and Drane emphasized theneed to stay focused and work very hard during the early stages of anentrepreneurial venture.andM;In the end, Lennane ended up getting proceeds of about $93 million out ofSII.andP;  He had put in $ 280,000 of his own money in the early days, so thereward was substantial.andP;  But he emphasized that he had invested more thanmoney: he had put in endless hours, had scrambled to make ends meet, hadwondered how he would feed his family.andP;  Those are the entrepreneurial dues hehad to pay to reap the rich reward he now enjoys.andP;  Lennane, who now dealswith young companies as a venture capitalist, wonders if people willing tomake that kind of sacrifice can still be found today.andM;He contends that entrepreneurs are becoming an endangered species because oftwo trends: high levels of pay for people right out of college (which makesbeing an employee attractive), and the high cost of starting a new business(which makes entrepreneurship unattractive).andM;Doug Drane touched on some of the same ideas.andP;  He emphasized the need forflexibility and involvement with the customer in the entrepreneurialenvironment.andP;  Willingness to attack even ill-defined problems is essential.andO;&quot;You're not doing right unless 50% of the time you don't know what you aredoing,&quot; he said.andP;  At U.S.andP;  New andamp; World Report, the initial Atex installation,the Atex founders didn't know what they were doing.andP;  They changed code day byday on the production floor as it became clearer what was required.andM;The same was true at Newsday, the first real Atex editorial installation.andP;  Inthat case, the fledgling company came in with a proposal for aneight-terminal system only to be met with a request for a 250-terminal one.andO;Drane was at a loss for words when Newsday asked, &quot;Can you do it?&quot;andP;  ButCharlie Ying, without skipping a beat, replied &quot;Sure.&quot;andP;  And ultimately, theydid.andP;  But along the way they spent long hours changing things, fixing thingsand starting over on things.andP;  &quot;Stay till it works&quot; was the motto in thosedays.andM;Stay lean.andP;  Drane noted that it is possible to have to much money in anentrepreneurial situation.andP;  Too much money can lead a small, brilliant teamto become managers of a large, mediocre team instead of doing the creativework themselves.andM;This theme was echoed by Paul Brainerd, founder of Aldus, who acted asmoderator of the session.andP;  Brainerd started his company with a team of fourprogrammers.andP;  They often worked 12-hour days, and they drew only half-timesalaries (the balance was paid later, after Aldus was off the ground).andO;Because they could not afford a janitor, they each took turns doing clean-upduty in a five-week cycle.andP;  In six months of intense work, they were able tocreate a revolutionary product, PageMaker.andM;Drane also pointed out that most venture-funded companies either fail or makevery little money.andP;  Venture capitalists count on a few big winners to morethan make up for the losses and disappointments on other companies.andP;  Thismeans that start-up companies that want to attract venture capital mustpromise rapid growth and high returns, and that venture-funded companies areunder a great deal of pressure to swing for the home run rather than try formore modest--but less risky--singles and doubles.andM;Seize opportunities.andP;  Lennane singled out two major missed chances during thelater years of his SII career.andP;  The first was the proposal he made to Kodakin 1985 to merge SII and Atex--either by SII acquiring Atex or by Kodakacquiring SII.andP;  Lennane had a series of meetings with Kodak executives aboutthis possibility.andM;Lennane's argument was blunt: after such a merger there would be 400 peoplewhose functions duplicated others in the combined company.andP;  They could be letgo, saving about $24 million a year.andP;  Additional revenue could be generatedby raising prices, since the competition between the two companies would nolonger hold prices down.andP;  His plan projected a profit of $66 million on $300million in sales for 1989.andM;But Kodak was uncomfortable with the proposition, and the deal wasn't made.andM;The second missed opportunity was SII's failure to buy Scitex in 1986-87.andO;Scitex was nearly bankrupt, and the stock was down as low as $1.87 a share atone point.andP;  But Lennane saw that the company had potential; and on a visit toIsrael, he saw employees working hard to keep Scitex afloat.andP;  Lennane's ideawas to merge SII with Scitex through paying off the Scitex debt.andP;  But the SIIboard of directors did not like this plan and refused to approve it.andM;That was not the end of the story, however.andP;  Lennane, with the board'sblessing, personally acquired 600,000 Scitex shares at $2.andP;  He graduallyincreased his stake until he had invested $4.5 million ($3.5 million of itborrowed) in Scitex.andP;  Since then, Scitex stock has risen to $19 a share;Lennane's block is currently worth $20.5 million.andM;Though Lennane is forthright about making business decisions based onprofitability, he wants no part of dishonesty as a business approach.andP;  Hetold a story about a third opportunity, much earlier on SII's history, thatcould have helped SII in its battle with rival Atex.andM;It seems that a recently hired marketing person at SII, formerly with Atex,had not worked out and was fired.andP;  This man's files, which he did notimmediately retrieve, turned out to be full of confidential Atex documents.andO;Lennane wouldn't touch the contraband, but he didn't want to see thedocuments spread around the industry by the departing marketeer, either.andM;Lennane asked Doug Drane, whom he had never met and who happened to be at aconference in Las Vegas, to come to SII's Sacramento offices and confront themiscreant.andP;  Drane did so, and the Atex secrets were safe.andM;Find a sponsor willing to take a risk.andP;  In Atex's early days, the company wasdependent on the willingness of publishing operations like U.S.andP;  News andNewsday to take a chance on a small entrepreneurial company.andP;  That sort ofsponsor is even more valuable today, now that it has become a rarity.andM;Now, the risk is often borne by venture capitalists instead.andP;  Brainerd toldabout approaching fifty different venture capital firms, of which only onewas ultimately willing to invest.andM;Perhaps this lack of sponsorship is one person new companies so oftenoriginate as spinoffs from profitable end-user firms.andP;  (Such vendors asDigital Technology, Bestinfo and Ultimate started this way.)andP;  Such anarrangement can give a new company built-in end-user sponsorship and abuilt-in source of capital.andM;Serve a niche market very well.andP;  Both SII and Atex started out offeringcustomized solutions for a single customer or a small group of them.andP;  Theirsuccesses were based on building highly specialized systems that were betterat a specific set of applications (large newspapers and magazines) thananything else available.andM;Though Bill Givens did not say so, his company (ECRM) is also an example ofthis type of specialization.andP;  In that case, the focus is on high-qualitymonochrome scanners and output recorders for OEMs and end users, and onhigh-throughput, easy-to-use standalone products for the end user (theAutokon electronic cameras).andM;The advent of desktop publishing has caused many traditional vendors to startsearching for niches.andP;  Some have focused on multiuser functionality, otherson technically difficult features such as color separation or batchpagination, to separate their offerings from those available through retailchannels.andP;  Some companies have found they can stay profitable (or at leastsurvive) by occupying the right niche.andM;These, then, are the proven strategies for succeeding in this industry:andM;* In the early years, work hard and focus on the customer.andM;* Stay lean enough so that valuable expertise isn't diluted.andM;* Find a sponsor willing to take risks.andM;* Seize opportunities if they come.andM;* Work on serving a niche very well.andM;(To these strategies might be added one proposed facetiously by Jim Lennane:produce lots of publications and seminars.)andM;The success strategies listed above have been employed by relatively smallcompanies (our industry has supported only a handful of companies with salesof more than $ 100 million and none at all above $500 million).andP;  Now,suddenly, it is dominated by huge conglomerates--the &quot;chemical titans&quot; DuPont, Agfa and Kodak--each of whose total sales dwarf those of our wholeindustry.andP;  How will they fare?andP;  What strategies will they use?andM;Lennane and Drane are not optimistic about the titans' prospects for success.andO;Lennane feels large corporations inevitably produce an environment whereideas get squelched.andP;  He finished his presentation with a plea to would-beentrepreneurs: make your move while you are still young, and don't gettrapped in corporations by big salaries.andP;  The industry needs itsentrepreneurial startups.andM;Drane is no more hopeful than Lennane about the ability of largeconglomerates to manage entrepreneurial companies.andP;  Concepts derived fromexperience with factories do not apply to creative endeavors.andM;Vast resources.andP;  Each of the three conglomerates (none of which seemed happywith the &quot;chemical titan&quot; moniker) emphasizes the enormous resources it canbring to bear.andP;  These are of various kinds.andM;Kodak's Dave Monks emphasized the technical resources at its disposal.andP;  Eachday, it spends $3.5 million on research and development.andP;  (That's more thanmost publishing system vendors spend in a year!)andP;  Examples of recent Kodakdevelopments include a video sensor based on a four-million-pixel array,improved optical disc technology, and an image-processing workstation basedon Transputers.andP;  Specifically in the publishing area, Monks mentioned a colorRIP and an under-$20,000 PC-based color imaging system.andP;  These products areunder development, but no dates were given for introduction.andM;One-stop shopping.andP;  Du Pont is the most recent of the three titans to jointhe field.andP;  Its activities include a joint venture with Xerox (DX Imaging) todevelop laser xerographic color printers and color proofers, joint ownership(with Fuji) of Crosfield, and acquisition of Du Pont Design Technologies inCalifornia and of Camex and ImagiTex in New England.andM;As we reported last issue, Du Pont's Cliff Schwieter used the Seminars toannounce the course his company will follow in the prepress arena.andP;  Du Pontwants to provide a single source and a single number to call for everythingfrom film chemistry and printing plates to million-dollar prepress systems.andO;It is reorganizing to form a single Imaging Systems group that will handleall of these products.andM;As part of this change, as we discussed in our last issue, Du Pont's Camexsubsidiary is acquiring the ex-CSI and Hastech newspaper system operationsfrom Crosfield (which, in turn, is jointly owned by Du Pont and Fuji).andP;  Thesame Du Pont marketing organization that sells consumables will sell Camexand Crosfield systems in the U.S.andP;  The Fuji marketing organization will sellCrosfield systems in Japan, and Crosfield itself will sell Crosfield systemsin the rest of the world.andM;Schwieter said that he believes customers want a single supplier and a singlepoint of contact for all of their supplies and systems.andP;  The Du Pontmarketing organization will, in essence, buy systems products from the whollyowned Camex or Du Pont Design divisions or jointly owned Crosfield.andM;Seminars attendees did not seem to be impressed with the concept of buyingprinting plates and color systems from the same people.andP;  They appeared to beeven less impressed with the concept of separation of the product developmentcompanies (such as Camex) from the marketing organization.andP;  It will beinteresting to see how this concept really gets implemented.andP;  We suspect thatthere will have to be much closer ties between the product development peopleand the customer than Schwieter's presentation implied.andM;Lasagna.andP;  Bob Crevels, speaking for Agfa-Gevaert, also made a point of thetremendous resources of Agfa and its parent company Bayer.andP;  (As most of ourreaders know, Bayer owns Agfa, which in 1982 acquired Compugraphic, whichearlier had bought One Systems and Quadex; see illustration on this page.)andO;But he emphasized a sound product strategy and a thorough understanding ofcustomer requirements as even more important.andM;He described a modular approach to building systems that he said willunderlie all future Agfa publishing systems.andP;  Like a slice of lasagna, hesaid, all systems or subsystems that Agfa sells will contain at least some ofthe layered ingredients that go to making up an Agfa system.andM;Reactions.andP;  On the whole, as noted above, user reactions to the presentationswere very muted.andP;  Of the three, the newest into the arena (Du Pont) appearsmost convinced that size, financial resources, a household name and a unifiedmarketing effort are crucial differentiating factors.andP;  Kodak's Monks impliedthat Du Pont will have to learn for itself the hard lessons he believes Kodakhas learned over the past eight years.andP;  Agfa's Crevels sounded the most likea traditional (non-chemical-titan) publishing system vendor.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
