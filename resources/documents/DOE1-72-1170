The methods are not mutually exclusive, but one substitutingfor another according to evacuation duration. Results obtained for thesame area using different methods are compared. When evacuation lastsone week, few economic losses may be expected even if the populationmoving out and temporary housing imply extraordinary expenses to localcommunities. When evacuation extends from a few weeks to some few months,the production decrease induces a loss of wealth; this loss may be estimatedeither by considering wages reduction or by using the loss of value added.Moreover, losses can be valued for the evacuation period only or caninclude delayed impacts. There is a factor of 2-3 between the variousestimates for economic losses corresponding to a one month evacuation.For several months evacuation, simple methods which are presented heregive only rough preliminary estimates.</TEXT></DOC>
