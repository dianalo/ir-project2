The post-postwar era is dawning.   As the western half of the continent approaches a watershed inthe long trek toward union, its rival bloc beyond the Iron Curtainis falling to pieces. For Poland and Hungary, democracy beckons.East Germany, having spurned the new spirit of Mikhail S. Gorbachev,suffers the humiliation of more than 14,000 of its citizens fleeingWest.   These refugees, most of them young and skilled, are the lifebloodof the 40-year-old Communist state. Yet they have chosen to cutthemselves off from roots, friends and families and take theirchances in the West.   The phenomenon is not new. Hundreds have died attempting tobreach the 28-year-old Berlin Wall or the watch-towered frontierthat divides the Germanys.   What is breathtakingly different is that they fled via Hungary,once one of the hard-line Eastern bloc countries, now reformed andliberalized in a manner that leaves its ally East Germany lookinglike a dinosaur.   The whole continent of Europe has embarked on an adventure. Thegeopolitical order that was imposed after World War II and definedby an Iron Curtain from the Baltic to the Adriatic is crumbling, andno one can say what finally will take its place.   ``The `new Europe' is not yet born, but it is gestating,'' writesDaniel Vernet, a senior editor of the French daily Le Monde.   Much depends on whether Gorbachev can keep control of the forceshis reforms have unleashed. Will Moscow allow its satellites to flyinto new, uncharted orbits? Can it contain the pent-up ethnic andnationalist rage simmering in Latvia, Georgia, Armenia, Uzbekistanand other Soviet republics? Can the West afford the kind of aidneeded to keep the new democracies afloat?   There is widespread rejection of orthodox Communism and anadmission of its political, economic and social failures.   Meanwhile, in Western Europe, the 12 states of the EuropeanEconomic Community are about to pool their sovereignty and cementtheir political and economic union at the end of 1992 in what somewill be tempted to call a united states of Europe.   A huge bloc of 320 million people, untrammeled by frontiers, isabout to emerge. Fifty years ago they were at war with each other.   ``Europe is rediscovering itself. It is now able to put a lineunder the Second World War, look at itself and see where we are inthe world,'' says Robert Elphick, an EEC spokesman in London.   ``Eastern Europeans are also rediscovering themselves and fallingback on old traditions, expressing themselves through their ownculture and not through something imported from outside by forceablemeans,'' he said in an interview.   East and West, compelling images are being etched almost daily onEuropean minds: an East German woman painting a West German insigniaonto her car before crossing the border; giant machines digging atunnel to link Britain to France; in Poland, the East bloc's firstnon-Communist premier.   While the unity of Western Europe is the outcome of a plodding,painstaking process that began soon after World War II, events inEastern Europe are provoked by what French analyst Eva Kulesza calls``an acceleration of history.''   The postwar order, ``so threatening and yet so stable, sobasically unacceptable and yet so reassuringly predictable, isunraveling at an accelerating pace,'' says Francois Heisbourg,director of the London-based International Institute for StrategicStudies.   It ``may make adjustment difficult and sow the seeds of futureinstability,'' he wrote in The Independent newspaper in London.   Detlef Kuhn, director of the Bonn government's All-GermanInstitute, believes the refugee exodus has made German reunificationa live issue.   In an interview, Kuhn argued that if East Germany were toimplement the reforms needed to make it attractive to its 17 millioncitizens, the country would have to dump Communism, and then wouldcease to have any reason to exist.   ``My analysis is that unification would solve so many problemsthat we would have an economic boom, which is good not only forGermany but Europe as a whole,'' Kuhn said.   But the world may not be ready for an even bigger Germanydominating the heart of Europe with its mighty economic muscle.   ``If you go beyond the ritual calling for pulling down the BerlinWall, I think there is a feeling that German unification might notbe desirable,'' says Jonathan Hyde-Price, an analyst at the RoyalInstitute of International Affairs in London.   Since it is assumed that Moscow would tolerate a reunited Germanyonly if it were neutral, he said in an interview, ``I think there'sa feeling that West Germany is too important for NATO and the EEC torisk losing.''   Most analysts say it's far too early to write East Germany'sobituary. The Economist calculated that even with the exodus viaHungary, proportionately fewer people have left East Germany in thepast year than emigrate from Ireland, yet ``Nobody assumes thecollapse of Ireland.''   But it concluded unification would be the world's biggest changein 40 years, and ``is no longer a subject from which the eye can becomfortably averted.''   Mrs. Kulesza, head of Soviet and East European research at theindependent French Institute of International Relations, agrees.   ``What I'm worried about is whether we are really prepared for it_ do we really wanted a united Germany?'' she said in an interview.   In a profoundly gloomy analysis, Oxford University Professor JohnGray writes that the economic odds against Gorbachev may beinsurmountable, even with massive Western aid.   ``The danger is that the decay of the totalitarian system builtup by Stalin and Lenin will result not in the reconstitution of astable civil society, but in mounting chaos, economic collapse andthe destabilization of the experiments in controlled democracy inPoland and Hungary.''   If so, he wrote, ``Then what we are now witnessing in the SovietUnion is not the middle of a reform, but the beginnings of arevolution, whose course no one can foresee.''   Norman Stone, professor of modern history at Oxford University,sees ``the wheel turning full circle,'' to a point where ``We may,at long last, be realizing the aims with which we went to war 50years ago.   ``There are many problems to come,'' he wrote in The SundayTimes, ``but 1989 is a good year to be alive; we may, at long last,have won the war.''</TEXT></DOC>
