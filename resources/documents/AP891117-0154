McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal Reserve policymakers decided to keepinterest rates unchanged early this fall, but agreed to ease theirgrip on credit if developments warranted, according to minutes oftheir October meeting released Friday.   In fact, the central bank surprised everyone on Nov. 7 when itpermitted a key interest rate, the federal funds rate, to drop from8.75 percent to 8.5 percent.   Manipulation of this rate, the interest banks charge each otherfor overnight loans, is the primary lever the Fed uses to controlshort-term interest rates.   The initial decision to keep rates unchanged was reached on a9-2 vote at an Oct. 3 meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee,composed of Fed governors in Washington and five of the 12 Fedregional bank presidents.   The committee met again last Tuesday, but minutes of thatsession will not be released until late December. The committeegathers in secret eight times a year to formulate monetary policyand confers by telephone as needed.   The Washington Post reported Nov. 8 the latest decision to easerates was made during a telephone conference call Nov. 6 amongmembers of the Open Market Committee.   The quarter-point drop was the fifth small decline that hasoccurred since late May when the central bank began to reverse ayearlong effort to drive interest rates higher as a way to fightinflationary pressure.   At its Oct. 3 meeting, the committee noted ``that underlyinginflationary pressures were likely to ease a little over the nextseveral quarters'' while ``economic activity continued to expand ata moderate pace in the third quarter.''   As a result, the minutes said, ``all but two of the membersindicated that they preferred or could accept a directive thatcalled for maintaining the current degree of pressure ... and thatprovided for giving particular weight to potential developmentsthat might require some slight easing ...''   The dissenting votes were cast by Roger Duffey, president of theKansas City regional Fed Bank, who preferred an unchanged policybecause of concern that inflation would continue to be too high,and Fed Gov. Martha Seger, who favored immediate easing because ofthe weakening economy.</TEXT></DOC>
