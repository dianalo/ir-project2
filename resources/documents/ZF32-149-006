(Product development).andO;Ticker:    MSFT.andO;Topic:     Product DevelopmentSoftware PublishersBASICProgramming languagesStrategic Planning.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Way back in 1975, Bill Gates and his college buddy Paul Allen wrote and solda version of BASIC for the Altair, the first personal computer.andP;  MicrosoftBASIC was the launching pad for their company.andP;  Now, Gates is betting he canenshrine BASIC as the lingua franca of the PC.andM;BASIC is strategic to Microsoft's plans.andP;  Consider its latest applicationslineup: Microsoft Word, with WordBASIC; Microsoft Excel, with BASIC.andP;  Andprovided Microsoft ever gets around to releasing it, a database-managementprogram with BASIC.andM;Now consider that WordBASIC is application-specific.andP;  This means WordBASIC&quot;understands&quot; Word's functions and commands, and knows what word processorsdo.andM;The same holds true for Excel's BASIC.andP;  It's spreadsheet-smart.andP;  As a result,it's easy to write macros that tie third-party applications directly intoMicrosoft's programs.andP;  And as third parties cast their lot with Microsoft,BASIC becomes central to Microsoft's future success.andM;The strategy seems to be working.andP;  Third-party vendors are writing WordBASICmacros that link their product directly to Word.andP;  Macros have alreadyappeared in many products, giving Microsoft Word menus new sets of commandsthat send and receive PROFS Notes, E-mail and faxes.andM;Calera's WordScan optical character-recognition software can even scan a faxand convert a bit map to an editable text file.andP;  A macro from Polaris makesPackrat's address book accessible from Word.andM;The second round in Microsoft's power play is Visual Basic, unveiled lastweek at Comdex.andP;  Visual Basic ties right in with Microsoft's plans, becausedownstream, Microsoft wants to have a global BASIC that works between (andinside) applications.andP;  And someday, all these BASICs will talk to each other.andM;But Visual Basic may just give away Microsoft's game, since Microsoft'sagenda calls for an embedded BASIC SDK to be bundled in Windows 4.0 late in1993.andM;Despite the hyperbole, Visual Basic is just Basic with a face-lift.andP;  Thereare drawing tools for creating a Windows interface, an event-driven languagethat links functions to the interface elements, and editing and debuggingtools.andP;  Visual Basic links compiled code and creates EXE files.andP;  What's more,it supports DDE and OLE features, and generates real, compilable code.andM;But Visual Basic is an awkward way to jump-start a Windows application.andP;  Itsinterprocess communications are poor.andP;  For every object created, there may bea dozen messages that require handling.andP;  A programmer sees only fragments ofcode, and the debugger is not interactive.andM;Visual Basic's front end -- a forms maker for creating Windows objects suchas menu bars, pop-up windows and dialog boxes -- was borrowed from Ruby, apoint-and-click construction package developed by Cooper Software forMicrosoft and intended for Windows 3.0.andP;  Ruby was dropped from the bundle tomake room for Asymetrix's Daybook.andP;  Ruby eventually landed in Microsoft'sLanguage Group (which is responsible for Visual Basic).andM;Visual Basic will be a hard sell.andP;  Programmers of the COBOL and FORTRANpersuasion view BASIC as a toy, and the object-oriented crowd would be happyto see Basic become extinct.andP;  As for non-programmers, they will probably findVisual Basic too complex.andP;  Microsoft may not succeed in standardizing the PCworld around its founders' original vision, but a lot of money and effortwill soon be going in this direction.andP;  Much as &quot;real&quot; programmers dislikeBASIC, it might not be a bad idea for these chess players to stay conversantwith checkers.andM;--------------------Carole Patton is editor in chief of Acknowledge The Window Letter, publishedin Mendham, N.J.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
