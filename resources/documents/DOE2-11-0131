In 1980 TCE and PCE were discovered in 25% of DWP'swells. In July 1981, DWP and the Southern California Association of Governmentsbegan a two-year study funded by EPA. The study revealed the occurrenceof ground-water contamination plume patterns that are spreading towardthe southeast. The primary contaminant of concern to the ground-wateris TCE with PCE and other VOCs present. The selected remedial actionfor the site is ground-water pump and treatment using aeration and granular-activated-carbon- air-filtering units, with discharge to the DWP Pumping Station forchlorination and distribution. Spent carbon will be removed and replacedwith fresh carbon, with the spent carbon scheduled either for disposalor regeneration. The estimated capital cost for this remedial actionis $2,192,895 with present worth Oandamp;M of $2,284,105.</TEXT></DOC>
