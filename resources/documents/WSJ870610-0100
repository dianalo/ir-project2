In their first joint statement of the meeting, the seven leaders called for new efforts to end the Iran-Iraq war, including &quot;just and effective measures&quot; by the United Nations Security Council. The statement said that free navigation through the gulf &quot;is of paramount importance for us and for others and must be upheld.&quot;    But the document didn't make any mention of the U.S. naval effort to keep navigation flowing, and didn't offer help of any kind, military or non-military, to the U.S. Nor did the statement include any explicit reference to the sort of tough provisions the U.S. hopes to see in any U.N. resolution, such as the threat of an arms embargo against whichever combatant refuses to negotiate an end to the war.    The declaration on the gulf was far shorter and less detailed than two other statements included in the leaders' communique, proclaiming unity on East-West relations and pledging specific steps to fight terrorism. Contrary to the expectations of U.S. officials, the leaders have spent almost no time discussing the Persian Gulf issue, which had dominated Reagan administration activities in the period leading up to the summit.    Secretary of State George Shultz said that &quot;I think we have done basically what we want&quot; on the gulf issue. He contended that the vague language hid stronger agreement on details of a gulf policy, including support for a U.N. resolution with arms-embargo sanctions that might be imposed against Iran and Iraq.    But foreign officials offered a contrasting view. A high-ranking French official said that &quot;the United States made a big publicity push on the gulf prior to the summit, getting it on the agenda, sending us all telegrams, but once here they have been very, very discreet. It has barely been mentioned so far. Perhaps they saw they would have no support for military intervention or specific action.&quot;    Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans, here as a representative of the European Community, said: &quot;We {Europeans} came here to drive the Americans off the military path and back to the diplomatic path. We have succeeded.&quot; British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher also had expressed concerns that the U.S. was considering a preemptive strike against Iran in order to prevent the deployment of Chinese Silkworm missiles.    So far, the U.S. has appeared unable to control the summit meeting as much as it has in previous years. On Monday, for instance, White House officials publicly and privately advised reporters that they expected the gulf to be a major topic of the leaders' opening dinner that night. But the subject wasn't even mentioned, as the leaders instead engaged in a very long, spirited debate about nuclear-weapons strategy and how to handle the new Soviet leadership.    &quot;Sometimes it's a little hard to predict what people are going to talk about,&quot; Secretary of State Shultz told reporters yesterday, trying to put the best face on things.    On another topic, Japanese officials, instead of welcoming what was a political gift from President Reagan, gave a cool public greeting to his lifting of some trade sanctions and demanded further measures.    And the large White House press apparatus has seemed off its game here. As the White House team left last week for the summit, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it was &quot;unlikely&quot; that Mr. Reagan would lift any of the trade sanctions on Japanese goods, and other White House officials privately echoed that view. But then Mr. Reagan decided to do so. Even though White House officials signaled this shift the day before the actual announcement, they insisted publicly that Mr. Reagan made the decision himself, during a bilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.    The East-West statement didn't include any specific language endorsing the growing consensus in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on the Soviet proposal for eliminating all intermediate-range nuclear missiles from Europe. Unlike the Persian Gulf statement, however, it praised U.S. efforts to negotiate reductions in nuclear weapons.    The leaders affirmed their commitment &quot;to the principle of making no concessions to terrorists or their sponsors.&quot; They reaffirmed the commitment to try or extradite terrorists.    President Reagan contended that the statement on the gulf satisfied him. Asked why it didn't have more teeth in it, he quipped, &quot;We couldn't think of anybody to bite.&quot;    ---   Walter S.
