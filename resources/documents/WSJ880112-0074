The Nasdaq industrials at the close were off 1.41 points, or 0.41%, at 344.72. More telling, however, was that among the Nasdaq issues, declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones more than two to one, as investors dumped the smaller issues.    Traders said much of the apparent collapse in small stock prices yesterday reflected the wounded nature of the OTC market rather than a mass sell-off by individual investors. Nasdaq volume, at some 129 million shares, was relatively light. &quot;There wasn't much selling but nobody was buying,&quot; explained Muriel Siebert of Muriel Siebert andamp; Co., a New York-based discount firm that does business in both OTC and listed stocks.    One result of the selling was that market makers on Nasdaq attempted to pull away from the market by lowering their bid prices, or the amount they would pay for shares. &quot;They were pummeled once, and they figured if this is going to be another free fall they weren't going to be involved,&quot; Ms. Siebert explained.    As a result, bids put forth by the market-making brokers in the OTC market generally fell, as a handful of individual investors attempted to sell their shares.    There appeared to be little or no margin-related selling in yesterday's market, according to traders. This dominated the sagging OTC markets that followed the October crash, causing prices to continue downward long after those on the New York Stock Exchange recovered.    The main sellers were individual investors who -- following Friday's collapse in the prices of Big Board stocks and a weekend of televised talk about the presidential commission's report on the October crash -- apparently decided to wash their hands of the whole thing.    &quot;The report was very revealing to the little guy,&quot; said Ms. Siebert. &quot;Suddenly he is coming to realize the crash wasn't caused by the economy, it was caused by the big boys playing,&quot; she said. &quot;How can I come out in a market such as this?&quot;one individual asked her yesterday, she said, adding she had no answer. Nonetheless, she said, few individuals sold yesterday, but they stopped buying. &quot;The little guy is shellshocked,&quot; she said.    On the OTC market, massive selling without buying can produce an artificial tilt to the averages. That's because shares are sold at a low price to market makers, who resell them to other investors at a higher one. A preponderance of selling means the prices at which the OTC stocks traded yesterday were primarily at the lower, or bid, prices.    Interestingly, while far more Nasdaq issues dropped in price than rose yesterday, more actual shares rose in price than fell. On Nasdaq's National Market System, 1,368 issues declined yesterday, representing 38.7 million shares. But 39.3 million shares traded in the 643 issues that rose.    Indeed, the Nasdaq 100 index of the largest Nasdaq issues closed at 317.75, up 1.36 points. And prices of the giant computer and technology issues that were hit hard in Friday's sell-off rallied yesterday in the same sort of correction that caused the bounce-back on the Big Board. Apple Computer rose 2 1/2 to 42 1/2; Microsoft was up 1 7/8 to 57 7/8; Genentech was up 1 7/8 to 44 5/8, and Intel rose 3/4 to 26 3/4.    One issue, Stanadyne, surged 17 1/4 to 39 1/2 yesterday as the result of a takeover offer. And medium-sized issues that were hurt Friday also rallied. These included Nike, up 1/2 to 18 3/4; Stratus Computer, up 2 to 24 1/2; Calgon Carbon, up 1 1/2 to 38 1/4, and Chips andamp; Technologies, up 1 1/2 to 16 1/4. </TEXT></DOC>
