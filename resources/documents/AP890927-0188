They cited the exodus of refugees from East Germany and HongKong residents who fear Chinese rule.   The foreign ministers of Cuba, Portugal, Bangladesh, thePhilippines and Israel also addressed the U.N. General Assembly.Cuba accused the United States of meddling in the affairs of itsneighbors to the south.   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering exercised his right of replyat the end of the day's debate, rising to protest ``the contentiouslanguage and distortions by the foreign minister of Cuba.''   Speeches began Monday as part of the General Assembly's annualthree-week debate of political, economic and social problems.   Foreign Secretary John Major of Britain said London will offerresettlement in Britain to Hong Kong residents anxious over Chineserule, which will begin in 1997.   Many Hong Kong residents are worried about their future undercommunist China following its repression of the student-ledpro-democracy movement in June.   ``Millions of us around the world were shocked to see Chinesetroops kill and wound their fellow citizens on the orders of theirown government,'' Major said. ``No government can surviveindefinitely by the suppression of peaceful dissent.''   Major said Britain will offer ``a package to encourage peopleessential to Hong Kong's future stability and prosperity to staythere, by giving them guarantees of resettlement in Britain if theywish. That package would be designed not to strip Hong Kong of itspeople, but to give them hope and confidence to remain.''   He did not elaborate.   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany lamentedthe exodus of East Germans, who have fled their country for greaterfreedom in West Germany.   ``Deeply moved, we witness the fate of young people who aresorrowfully leaving their home and their familiar surroundings'' hesaid.   East Germany blames the West for encouraging its people to leavewith false promises of a better life.   But Genscher said reforms ``would open up new prospects in theGerman Democratic Republic, as in other central and EasternEuropean countries. This will encourage the people to stay.''   He also reassured Poland, the victim of German aggression inWorld War II, that West Germany would never again threaten itsfrontiers.   ``The wheel of history will not be turned back,'' Genscher said.   Most leaders who have addressed the General Assembly this weekhave expressed optimism about resolving international conflicts.   But Foreign Minister Isidoro Malmierca of Cuba said ``we have adifficult road ahead'' unless Washington gives up its ``policy ofarrogance.''   Malmierca accused Washington of fomenting unrest in Panama withits troops stationed in the Canal Zone, and of meddling inNicaragua's 1990 election by funding the opposition candidates.   In addition, said Malmierca, ``The people of Puerto Rico lingerunder a foreign boot, after almost 100 years of U.S. militaryoccupation.''   Portugal's foreign minister, Joao de Deus Pinheiro, requestedmore world aid for Africa to aid ``the refugees and displacedpersons'' driven from their homes by conflict in Angola,Mozambique, Namibia and South Africa.   Philippine Foreign Secretary Raul S. Manglapus called forestablishment of an international advisory commission in whichlender and creditor nations could discuss debt relief plans anddevelopment.   The United States has expressed a preference to conductnegotiations of that type through the World Bank.   Bangladesh's foreign minister, Anisul Islam Mahmud, also calledfor debt relief for developing nations. ``The proportion of`hardcore poor' in these countries has increased staggeringly,'' hesaid.   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens appealed for world supportof Israel's plan for elections in the occupied territories, butmade no mention of Egypt's proposal to bring together Israeli andPalestinian leaders for talks in Cairo.   He said Palestinians in the occupied lands should end theiruprising; the 20 Arab nations still technically at war with Israelought to begin normalizing relations, and asked world help inrehabilitating Palestinian refugee camps.   The Palestine Liberation Organization's permanent observer,Zuhdi Labib Terzi, protested later that his people are resistingIsraeli occupation and military rule and ``more than 700 have beenthe victims of those atrocities'' since the uprising began.   The speeches begin the General Assembly's annual three-monthsession.</TEXT></DOC>
