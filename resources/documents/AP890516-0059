Mrs. Suzman, 71, is the longest-serving member of Parliament,having represented the same Johannesburg constituency since 1953.   From 1961 through 1974, she was the only legislator representingthe anti-apartheid opposition and often cast the sole vote againstdiscriminatory or repressive laws.   She announced she would not seek re-election on Sept. 6, when ageneral election will be held for the white, Asian and mixed-racechambers of Parliament. She has campaigned consistently to extendpolitical rights to the black majority, which has no representationin Parliament.   Mrs. Suzman has represented four liberal parties, the firstthree of which either merged with or were replaced by another.Starting in 1959, she represented the Progressive Party, whichlater was broadened and renamed the Progressive Federal Party.   In April, that party joined with two other anti-apartheidfactions to form the Democratic Party.   Harry Oppenheimer, the industrialist who has helped financeanti-apartheid political parties, wrote of Mrs. Suzman last year:``Our hope and our faith owe more than any of us can say to thecareer, the personality and the example of Helen Suzman.   ``For 14 lonely years as the sole Progressive in Parliament, shekept alive a proper respect for human dignity, a deep sympathy forhuman suffering, and a hatred of all cruelty and injustice.''   Probably more so than any other white elected official, Mrs.Suzman won the trust and good will of black activists. She attendedfunerals of slain militants, traveled frequently to black townshipsand in 1987 finished ninth in a poll asking black newspaper readerswho they would like to see as president.   She also has met several times with imprisoned black nationalistleader Nelson Mandela and repeatedly has called for his release.   In 1985-86, at the height of political unrest in blacktownships, Mrs. Suzman refused to join militant anti-apartheidleaders in calling for punitive economic sanctions aganst SouthAfrica. She said such measures would make whites more resistant tochange and prevent blacks from making economic gains that wouldhelp them acquire political leverage.   ``I absolutely understand the moral outrage against apartheid. Ishare it,'' she said in 1987. ``But I cannot support the practicalresults of this policy (of sanctions).''   She received the United Nations Award of the InternationalLeague for Human rights in 1978, and has twice been nominated forthe Nobel Peace Prize.</TEXT></DOC>
