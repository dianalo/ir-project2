(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Paula MusichandM;Dueling hub vendors SynOptics Communications Inc. and Cabletron Systems Inc.andO;are positioning themselves to do battle at next month's InterOp 91 Fallnetworking exhibition over how to deliver FDDI to desktop users.andM;Both vendors recently announced Fiber Distributed Data Interface productfamilies for their respective intelligent wiring concentrator lines.andP;  Bothplan to demonstrate the products at InterOp in San Jose, Calif., joiningfirms such as 3Com Corp. that are planning similar demonstrations.andM;The result will be a &quot;holy war&quot; over the best approach to getting morebandwidth for the desktop PC user, said Alan Kessler, vice president andgeneral manager of 3Com's Network Systems Division in Santa Clara, Calif.andO;Battle lines will be drawn around running the 100M-bps FDDI technology overfiber, shielded twisted-pair and unshielded twisted-pair media.andM;Another option, which Kessler hinted that 3Com may be pursuing, is running&quot;private Ethernet to the desktop from a second-generation repeating hub.&quot;andM;The goal in each of the approaches is to drive down the high cost of FDDIconnectivity, which industry observers say has stalled the market for FDDInetworks.andP;  Pricing varies widely depending on the type of end systemconnection and media used; for example, the cost to connect a single DigitalEquipment Corp.andP;  RISC workstation over fiber is $8,000, according to JanetHyland, director of network strategy research at Forrester Research Inc., amarket researcher in Cambridge, Mass.andM;The high cost of such connections has relegated FDDI to serving as ahigh-speed backbone at the University of Michigan, according to John Hintz,senior computer systems specialist at the university, in Ann Arbor.andP;  &quot;We hadconsidered putting our servers on FDDI but didn't because of the cost,&quot; saidHintz, who uses Cabletron bridges to link Ethernet subnetworks onto the FDDIbackbone.andM;SynOptics' new suite of FDDI products falls in both the fiber and shieldedtwisted-pair camps.andP;  The products include an enhanced concentrator thatsupports Ethernet, Token-Ring and FDDI connections; an FDDInetwork-management module for the concentrator as well as Unix-basednetwork-management software; four-port fiber and shielded twisted-pairmodules; and pre-configured shielded twisted-pair and fiber work-group hubswith 14 ports.andP;  Most of those products will be available next month from theSanta Clara firm.andM;Cabletron's new suite of FDDI hub products falls solely in the fiber camp.andO;It includes an Ethernet-to-FDDI bridge module, four-and eight-port FDDImodules, and a combination bridge and four-port FDDI module for the firm'sexisting Multi Media Access Center hub.andM;Although the Rochester, N.H., firm is taking the high ground by focusing onfiber wiring for its new FDDI products -- slated for release in the firstquarter of 1992 -- Cabletron may be more aggressive on pricing (see chart).andM;Last year, based on revenues, SynOptics captured 29 percent of the U.S.andO;intelligent concentrator market, with Cabletron capturing 19 percent,according to Dataquest Inc., a market-research firm in San Jose.andM;Cabletron can be reached at (603) 332-9400.andP;  SynOptics can be reached at(408) 988-2400.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
