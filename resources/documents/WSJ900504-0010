By most accounts, that definition would make an insidertrader out of a corporate director every time he buys orsells stock in his company, regardless of whether he usesinsider information.</LP><TEXT>   The janitor who vacuums the corporate boardroom also mightfit the bill, as might the investor who subscribes to stockresearch not generally available to the public.   &quot;The definition of insider is a problem,&quot; says StephenCheong, a member of the Legislative Council, Hong Kong'slegislature. &quot;It's so sweeping that, if abused, we couldbecome the laughing-stock of the financial world.&quot;   His voice is but one among a growing chorus of concernover the draft legislation. Not that the legislation soundsmuch fuzzier than existing law. And like existing law, itstops short of calling the practice a crime.   But the draft bill does differ from current law in onesignificant way. Whereas insider traders now face noconsequences other than embarrassment from officialdisclosure of their misconduct, they would be subject tofines and even banishment from corporate office under theproposed ordinance.   With such a threat looming, Hong Kong's financialcommunity is combing through the proposal. And objections arebeing raised not just by habitual critics of marketregulation. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange, no pushover when itcomes to policing the market, sees flaws in the proposal aswell. In the process, what started as an assault on tradingmalpractices has turned into a forum on the dangers ofregulatory overkill. And it has put the government on thedefensive.   &quot;I don't deny that there's a fashion out there for sayingthat all is well and that there is no need for change,&quot; saysDavid Nendick, the government's secretary for monetaryaffairs. &quot;But I do not accept that there is too muchregulation. I would be failing in my duty if I sway withpublic sentiment.&quot;   Public opinion, indeed, seems to have taken an abruptturn. The global stock crash of October 1987 drew wideattention to pitfalls in Hong Kong's hands-off regulatoryapproach. Insider trading, though not part of the problem onthat occasion, has since been targeted by the government asone of many malpractices that require tougher policing. Butthe entire reform exercise appears to be facing stiff publicresistance as memory of the crash fades.   The apparent vacillation underscores to some extent HongKong's conflicting priorities. As regional rivalry forinvestor attention grows, the colony is keen to move awayfrom its image as a financial center in which just aboutanything goes. But given the territory's 1997 return toChina's rule, tough new laws inevitably invite concern thatthey could be abused by future administrations. That makesinsider trading -- by consensus a widespread practice thatcan't be tackled without tough new laws -- the focus of anacute dilemma.   &quot;It's a very difficult subject,&quot; says Derek Murphy,formerly Hong Kong's deputy securities commissioner andcurrently an executive with First Pacific Co., a diversifiedinvestment concern. &quot;And with 1997, it becomes even moreimportant to get the legal niceties right.&quot;   The burden for getting those niceties right falls for nowon Mr. Cheong, a businessman who heads the legislativecommittee reviewing the draft. Given growing public concern,he has asked the government to clarify several troublesomeclauses. As a result, the draft may not be cleared in timefor approval by the full legislature before it recesses inJuly.</TEXT></DOC>
