Price Communications will retain a 25% interest in the stations. It also will become a subordinated lender to Fairfield, a closely held New York company that was formed a few days ago for making this acquisition and others.    Robert Price, president of Price Communications, said the sale is a departure from the company's recent strategy of acquiring media operations rather than selling them. But he said he was willing to sell because &quot;the price was high and it's a very good deal.&quot;    The sale will help Price Communications, a four-year-old company, continue its acquisition strategy, Mr. Price said. The company owns 18 radio stations, four network-affiliated television stations, newspapers including the New York Law Journal and the National Law Journal, and an outdoor advertising concern.    The properties being sold to Fairfield are KIOI-FM, San Francisco; WNIC-FM and WMTG-AM, Detroit; WLAC-AM and WLAC-FM, Nashville, Tenn.; and KKOB-AM and KKOB-FM, Albuquerque, N.M.    The agreement is subject to the approval of the Federal Communications Commission and Price Communications' shareholders, as well as completion of Fairfield's financing. </TEXT></DOC>
