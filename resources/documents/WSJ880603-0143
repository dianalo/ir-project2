Judge Gerhard Gesell issued an order that said &quot;a substantial portion of the government's case in chief still remains and in all probability may remain classified,&quot; and thus inadmissible. This means Lawrence Walsh got the indictments without first making sure he could get clearance to use secret government documents as evidence. Judge Gesell also gave Mr. Walsh two weeks to produce the documents he does have permission to use, and which &quot;count or counts of the indictment . . . will not be prosecuted&quot; because of a lack of admissible evidence. That is, Mr. Walsh may well have to drop all charges. </TEXT></DOC>
