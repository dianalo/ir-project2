(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Heard the one about the two-headed snakethat couldn't agree on which head got to eat dinner?   It's no joke, if you're talking about the two-headed black ratsnake named ``IM'' (for ``instinct'' and ``mind'') that has beenunder observation at the University of Tennessse here since shortlyafter its birth 12 years ago.   ``If one head gets a good grip on the head of the mouse and theother gets a good grip on the tail, they can fight for hours unlessyou stop them,'' said Gordon Burghardt, who teaches psychology andzoology at the university.   ``They're simply fighting for the privilege of swallowing themouse,'' he said Wednesday. The prey in their twice-monthly meals,he noted, ends up in the common stomach.   IM is showing researchers whether over time animals can learn toshare, he said. ``We found the left head ate more prey, but it wassmaller. And the right head ate fewer prey which tended to belarger,'' he said.   ``Over five years, the weight of the prey eaten was identical(for both heads). So the animals were in some sense splitting theresource. We didn't expect that,'' he said.   The university got IM from nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory,where two boys found the animal in their family's garden.   Back then, the two heads ``really had two separate identities,''said Jerry Klein, a research engineer and amateur herpetologist atthe Oak Ridge lab. ``If one wanted to eat, it would try to keep thefood from the other.''   Burghardt said the animal also is providing clues on theories ofmotivation and cognition. ``We can test out some ideas inmotivational psychology that we normally couldn't, such as, why doyou stop eating?'' he said.   ``One is, do you stop eating when your stomach is distended? Oris the amount you eat determined by the effort in chewing andswallowing?   ``We're still analyzing at this point, but the indication is thatthe animal (IM's left head or right head) that swallows is somewhatless responsive afterward than the one that hasn't. That suggeststhat the act of eating plays some role on the regulation of foodintake.''</TEXT></DOC>
