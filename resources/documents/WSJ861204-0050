Larry Bird and Larry Tisch were both in it. In fact, Tisch was Bird's boss.    The way I remember it, Tisch had finished with CBS -- cut it down to a size he liked -- and, not having much to do one day, decided to horn in on the owners of the Boston Celtics, who had put 40% of their stock up for public sale. Tisch, of course, soon gained control of the premier team in professional basketball and went to work.    First to go were the ball boys. (It would have been too complicated legally to right away mess with the astronomical contracts of the Celtics stars.) Only one ball is used during the game, and Tisch figured it made no sense to waste good money on a bunch of kids to throw out seven or eight balls for warm-ups. Players loosening up would just have to fight for the ball and open shots as though they were in a game.    Other changes brought by Tisch were as breath-taking as a Celtics fast break:    --The starting five became the starting four. Critics of pro ball have long argued that with the size of today's athletes the game should either be played on a bigger court or with fewer players.    --The roster was cut from 12 players to seven. NBA stat sheets show that in many games, particularly close ones, four or five players don't see any action at all. Why pay players who don't play?    --He sold the benches for the subs.    --He fired the radio and TV announcers. Their duties were taken over by players who weren't in the game. Many of them would dabble in broadcasting when they retired, and this gave them some on-the-job training.    --All the assistant coaches were canned. There can be only one chief, and Tisch thought it was folly to fork over salaries to two or three assistant chiefs. If the coach needed to consult with someone about strategy during a crucial part of the game, let him call a time out and talk to the workers out on the floor.    --Pay showers were installed at Boston Garden, and the team stopped handing out free soap, towels and shampoo. Millions of Americans exercise every day and have to wait until they get home to shower. Why pamper a clump of sequoias? Those who really count in this world, accountants, don't have free showers at work, and Lord knows there are a lot more accountants than professional basketball players.    --The nets were shortened. If you've ever noticed -- and Tisch did right away -- there are three or four inches of cord on the nets that aren't really necessary. Savings from the shortened nets helped offset the costs of the pay showers.    --The Celtics lost their shirts. Every season money is thrown away on new jerseys. Mr. Tisch moved to restore the game to its simplest form of shirts vs. skins.    There may have been more coming, but I woke up. Since that night I've been shaking my head and hoping it won't happen, hoping that Tisch will resist the Celtic temptation and pick on some other national symbol. Maybe we'll be seeing the Mormon Tabernacle Quintet?    ---   Mr. McCoy, in Rockville Centre, N.Y., hopes someone will restructure the NBA's lowly Knicks. </TEXT></DOC>
