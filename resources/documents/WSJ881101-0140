Hunt (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson sharply rejected criticisms of his role in the Democratic Party and suggested the Democrats' difficulty in this year's presidential race is a result of trying to placate conservatives.    &quot;Some want us to spend our time and efforts pursuing Democrats who've defected,&quot; the civil-rights and black political leader declared in an interview. &quot;But I think our future is pursuing the vast number of people who feel they've been left out -- blacks, Hispanics, women. We should enlarge the franchise, not change it.&quot;    Mr. Jackson called The Wall Street Journal to complain about a front-page story last week that quoted a number of moderate or conservative Democrats charging Mr. Jackson with threatening to split the party along racial and class lines, especially if Michael Dukakis loses the election to George Bush next Tuesday.    Elaborating on his comments contained in the story, Mr. Jackson strongly disputed those assertions, criticized some of the more-conservative elements in the party, contended that he has campaigned more vigorously for Democrats this fall than anyone else has, including Michael Dukakis and his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, and said he has earned a prominent role in the party after the election. Much of his fire was aimed at the Democratic Leadership Conference, a group of moderate Democrats, such as former Virginia Gov. Charles Robb and Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, who are trying to move the party more to the middle.    &quot;The DLC has gotten everything it asked for in this election, but they're still pointing the finger at me,&quot; Mr. Jackson charged. &quot;They wanted a Super Tuesday {the Southern primaries in the Democratic nominating process}. They got it, but I got the most votes. In Atlanta, {site of the Democratic convention} they wanted a platform that didn't over-commit us. They got their consensus platform. Then they said they wanted one of their own as vice president. They got that and then said we can deliver on this ticket.&quot;    Mr. Jackson, who finished second to Gov. Dukakis in this year's Democratic presidential primaries, accused his conservative opponents of enjoying the political benefits of black loyalty but not wanting to share power. &quot;Picking cotton is all right only if you can have good wages and benefits and share in the equity.&quot;    He also said it's about time white political leaders understand reciprocity. &quot;I spend a lot of time in the black community convincing my constituents to vote for white candidates. That's why we won all those Southern Senate seats in 1986 and the Democrats won back control of the Senate. Now some of these white politicians must be just as willing to go to white voters and convince their constituents to support black candidates.&quot;    The backdrop to Mr. Jackson's remarks is the expectation of some sharp recriminations if the Democrats lose the presidential contest for the fifth time in the past six elections. Party moderates already are attributing this to the GOP's success in painting Michael Dukakis as a liberal and suggest that the high visibility of Jesse Jackson has alienated some white conservative voters. The Jackson forces reply that the problem instead is that by moving to the middle, the Democrats haven't sufficiently energized their basic constituencies.    Nevertheless, Mr. Jackson insisted that he doesn't seek to divide the party. &quot;I have consistently said I want to build a broader-based party and have campaigned for many conservative Democrats.&quot; He also took exception to those who claim opposition to him is based on ideology, not race. &quot;They can't find any ideological position I have imposed on the party.&quot;    Mr. Jackson insisted that all his efforts now are directed at helping the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket and thus it is &quot;premature&quot; to discuss his specific role after the election or who should be the party's next chairman. (Ron Brown, a prominent Washington lawyer and former top adviser to Mr. Jackson, is widely thought to be a candidate to be the next party chairman.)    But, not surprisingly, Mr. Jackson left no doubt that he expects to remain a major force in the Democratic Party, regardless of the election outcome. &quot;I think the Democrats should recognize work and productivity and service,&quot; he said. &quot;Based on my work, productivity and service, I expect to play a major role.&quot;    He said critics should compare his participation in this campaign with others. &quot;Since the Atlanta convention, I have traveled more miles, spoken to more people and registered more voters than any other Democratic senator, governor or congressman on behalf of the ticket.&quot; That includes, he contended, Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen.    Indeed, the former Democratic presidential candidate is keeping a feverish schedule. In the final week of the campaign, he'll be out stumping for Senate and House aspirants as well as the presidential ticket in more than a dozen states. </TEXT></DOC>
