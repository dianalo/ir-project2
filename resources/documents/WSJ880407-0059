Paul Laxalt (R., Nev.), arising from a $250 million libel suit dropped by Mr. Laxalt in June.    The newspaper chain said it was &quot;satisfied&quot; with the decision, noting that attorneys had asked for fees totaling $4.3 million. The award is not appealable and will be paid by McClatchy's insurance carrier, Gary Pruitt, the chain's general counsel, said.    Mr. Laxalt couldn't immediately be reached for comment, though he told the Washington Post that the judgment made it &quot;perfectly clear&quot; that he was &quot;irresponsibly wronged&quot; by the article that he sued over.    &quot;The (libel) case was dismissed with Laxalt receiving no money, no retraction and no apology,&quot; countered McClatchy's Mr. Pruitt.    The arbitration decision ends a rancorous five-year legal battle that began when McClatchy published an article about alleged illegal profit-skimming operations at a Nevada casino when it was owned by Mr. Laxalt and his brother.    Mr. Laxalt sued the chain, but settled last June while contemplating a run for the presidency that he never undertook. Under terms of the settlement, both sides agreed to put the question of Mr. Laxalt's attorneys' fees to a panel of three former federal judges. </TEXT></DOC>
