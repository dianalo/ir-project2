Edwards Inc., the biggest U.S. brokerage firm outsideof New York, posted record profits in what could be a previewof a strong earnings season for Wall Street.   While many securities firms haven't returned to profitlevels seen before the 1987 stock market crash, the St. Louiscompany, parent of A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons, said bothsecond-quarter revenue and net income hit records.</LP><TEXT>   In the quarter ended Aug. 31, net income rose 55% to $23.8million, or 67 cents a share. Expansion costs had held downthe year-earlier's net income to $15.3 million, or 45 cents ashare. Revenue grew 27% to $219.1 million from $172.5million. (Per-share earnings have been restated to reflect a3-for-2 stock split paid in June.)   The results boosted A.G. Edwards's stock yesterday to arecord. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,the stock jumped $1.25 to $28.50 on triple the recent averagevolume.   Most other brokerage-firm stocks also gained yesterday,except for Salomon Inc., which continues to suffer from theeffects of the firm's Treasury-auction scandal.   Benjamin Edwards III, chairman of A.G. Edwards, said thefirm is reaping the benefits of the expansion spree thecompany undertook in the most recent fiscal year, when A.G.Edwards opened 39 offices to bring the nationwide total to437. The firm currently has 445 offices, with more than 4,300brokers.   But Mr. Edwards said the firm hasn't been expanding asfast as it was, because as Wall Street's fortunes improvethere are fewer needs to fill and available brokers to hire.&quot;We're not seeing as many opportunities as last year,&quot; Mr.Edwards said. He added that he doesn't have a grand schemefor the company's expansion. &quot;Unfortunately, we're not thatclever. Business schools would all have fits with us. We justsort of react. We try to take advantage of opportunitieswhere they come up.&quot;   A.G. Edwards's second quarter hadn't been expected tomatch the record levels of the first. However, Mr. Edwardssaid there were &quot;some good days right at the end of theaccounting period&quot; that pushed the most recent quarter overthe top.   A.G. Edwards posted six-month earnings of $47.5 million,or $1.34 a share, compared with $29.7 million, or a restated86 cents, in the fiscal 1991 six months. In fact, in all oflast year, the company had net of $59.2 million.   The brokerage industry, after suffering one of its worstyears in 1990, has rebounded with a surge in thestock-underwriting business and periodic bursts of heavytrading volume. Among the biggest firms, only Salomon'searnings outlook is uncertain, partly because of the millionsof dollars in scandal-related charges it is expected to take.</TEXT></DOC>
