Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA)(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a proposed rulemaking, an opportunity forpublic comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a military and foreignaffairs function of the United States. This rule is not subject to therequirements of 13(b) of the EAA because it is not imposing new controls.Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking andan opportunity for public comments be given for this rule. Accordingly,it is being issued in final form. However, as with other Department ofCommerce rules, comments from the public are always welcome. Comments shouldbe submitted to Patricia Muldonian, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis,Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington,DC 20044.3.
