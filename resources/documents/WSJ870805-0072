Walter, then 23 years old, bought an unfinished shell home in Tampa, Fla., for $895 -- $500 of it borrowed from his father -- and resold it three days later at a $300 profit.    Mr. Walter soon quit his $50-a-week job as a truck driver and went into business with the house builder, O.L. Davenport, whom he bought out two years later to form Walter Construction Co., a predecessor of Jim Walter Corp.    The timing was perfect. With a strong postwar demand for inexpensive housing for veterans, the concept of shell housing took off, carrying along with it the career of Mr. Walter, whose formal schooling ended with 12th grade.    &quot;Jim is one of the real Horatio Algers,&quot; says Burke Kibler, a longtime friend and chairman of the Florida law firm of Holland andamp; Knight. &quot;He's enjoyed tremendous success.&quot;    Though Mr. Walter, now a silvery-haired 64-year-old, has enjoyed the trappings of wealth -- Rolls-Royce and Bentley autos, a yacht, fine wines and exotic travel -- he has remained largely untouched by his success and is most often described as &quot;down to earth&quot; and &quot;unpretentious.&quot; Friends say he's fond of pointing out that he began as a truck driver.    He stepped down as chief executive officer in 1983, yielding the reins to Joe B. Cordell. But Mr. Walter, who continues as chairman and had compensation for the company's fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 1986, totaling $847,193, is still at the center of any major move by the company.    &quot;When he's in Tampa, he still shows up at the office at 6 a.m.,&quot; says Thomas C. MacDonald Jr., a director. &quot;The only ones there are him and the security guard.&quot;    At present, the central decision before the company is what to do about a proposed $2.03 billion, $50-a-share, leveraged buy-out from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. The New York investment-banking firm, which specializes in taking companies private, made the bid in mid-July. A special committee of outside directors is working with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., its financial adviser, on evaluating the bid.    At the time of the buy-out proposal, Mr. Walter -- who declined to be interviewed for this story -- described Henry Kravis, the managing general partner of Kohlberg Kravis, as &quot;an absolute gentleman for whom I have the highest regard,&quot; and said he considered the proposal &quot;friendly.&quot; Kohlberg Kravis, as it typically does, invited Mr. Walter and other top managers to join in the buy-out group, and Mr. Walter said he probably would like to do so under the right circumstances.    Last week, Jim Walter said that other parties besides Kohlberg Kravis are interested in it -- though no firm competing bids have emerged -- and that it was furnishing information to those parties as well as to Kohlberg Kravis.    Wall Street analysts think that coming up with a bid may be confounding those parties because Jim Walter faces asbestos-claims liability that is considered significant but hasn't been determined. Kohlberg Kravis, for example, mulled over the company particulars for six months before making a proposal.    Jim Walter still builds low-priced houses for which it also provides mortgage financing. It also has holdings in building materials, pressure pipes, paper distribution, mining, gas and oil, and retail jewelry. Fiscal 1986 net income was $138.6 million, or $3.71 a share as adjusted for a recent stock dividend, on revenue of $2.37 billion.    Mr. Walter, who owns about 532,000, or 1.3%, of the 40,556,000 shares outstanding, is regarded by business associates and friends as a sure bet to make the right move in this deal as he has in most every one in the past. He is considered to be a detail-oriented executive with a keen ability to digest reams of complex information and come up with a decision.    &quot;He's street smart. He's a great appraiser of values, very diligent,&quot; says William Spencer, a long-time friend who is the retired president and chief operating officer of Citicorp, the New York-based bank holding company, and its Citibank unit. &quot;He sees how things can make money.&quot;    It is unclear whether he would continue in an active role at the company if a leveraged buy-out is completed. Despite his continuing interest in work, he isn't known as a workaholic and he enjoys recreation. He is an avid fisherman and keeps an 81-foot motor yacht that he dubbed the &quot;TICA&quot; -- short for This I Can't Afford. He maintains an apartment in London, a beach house near Tampa, and a 1,800-acre ranch in central Florida. The ranch is a retreat, used primarily for its excellent quail hunting -- his passion.    And he has been leaning toward retirement for some time. Friends recall Mr. Walter was easing into a less-active role as early as 1980, but returned with full force when the company was hit by its worst crisis: the recession and sky-high interest rates that sent corporate profits into a tailspin in 1981 and 1982.    Associates say it was perhaps during those tough times that Mr. Walter shined brightest, achieving a remarkably successful rebound. He reduced staff, grounded the company jets, temporarily abolished bonuses and froze salaries, and slashed the common stock dividend. Poorly performing operations with total annual sales of more than $250 million were shed. The result was a leaner and more-competitive company.    &quot;Those are difficult things to do, but Jim did them, and I think it was a very good turnaround,&quot; says Mr. MacDonald, a Jim Walter director. </TEXT></DOC>
