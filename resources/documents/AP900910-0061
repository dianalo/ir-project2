No one was seriously injured in the explosion, police said. Onewoman was taken to a hospital suffering from shock.   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But suspicionfell on the Irish Republican Army, which has attacked at leastseven military establishments in England this year, killing onesergeant and injuring a dozen people.   ``It felt like an earthquake going off,'' said BarbaraBeresford, manager of a shop near the recruiting center. ``Therewas glass raining down and I saw people thrown to the ground.''   Police said seven staff were employed in the building in Derby'sshopping precinct.   The worst damage, witnesses said, was at the back of therecruiting center and to a seven-storey building adjoining it.   Anti-terrorist officers were called to Derby, 130 miles fromLondon, and bomb disposal experts picked through debris and thescoured the building for a possible second device.   A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said thebomb contained two to five pounds of explosives.   In their most serious recent attack, IRA guerrillas killedlegislator Ian Gow, a close associate of Prime Minister MargaretThatcher and chairman of the Northern Ireland Committee in theHouse of Commons. He died in a car bomb blast July 30.   The overwhelmingly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting to end Britishrule in Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite it with theRepublic of Ireland.</TEXT></DOC>
