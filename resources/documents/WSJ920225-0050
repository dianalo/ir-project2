The decision was prompted by a serious decline in the onceabundant cod stocks in the Grand Banks region off the coastof Newfoundland province. The cuts are expected to lead tofish plant closures and layoffs, particularly inNewfoundland, which accounts for most of Canada's codharvest.</LP><TEXT>   Canadian Fisheries Minister John Crosbie set the totalallowable 1992 cod catch at 120,000 metric tons, down from aprevious level of 185,000 tons. The quota in the first sixmonths of this year will be limited to 25,000 tons, half ofthe amount caught in the same period last year. A metric tonis equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.   The Canadian government sets catch quotas annually topreserve fishing stocks.   Mr. Crosbie banned cod fishing during peak spawningseasons. He also suspended harvesting of capelin, a main foodsource for cod.   Mr. Crosbie also said the government will study ways toexpand Canada's seal hunt. Fishermen blame part of the codshortage on a growing seal herd, which feeds on cod andcapelin.   The fishing industry also put some of the blame onoverfishing by foreign fleets, particularly Spanish andPortuguese vessels, near Canada's territorial boundary. ACanadian delegation is to meet later this week with EuropeanCommunity Commission officials to ask them to reduce theircod catch in the North Atlantic waters.</TEXT></DOC>
