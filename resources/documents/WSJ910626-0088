About $1 million of that moneywent back into the company's stock, filings made with theSecurities and Exchange Commission show, in purchases by thedefense contractor's chairman, vice chairman and three otherinsiders.   Good timing: General Dynamics shares hit a 52-week highMonday, though they fell back yesterday.</LP><TEXT>   At its annual meeting May 1, the St. Louis, Mo., concerntied compensation of its top 25 officials to gains in itsstock price. On May 6, that formula triggered $5.1 million inbonuses -- just as the company announced plans to trim 30% ofits jobs, or about 27,000 positions, during the next fouryears.   SEC filings show that on the day after receiving hisbonus, William Anders, chairman of General Dynamics, bought5,000 shares for $197,500. His purchase increased his totalholdings by 16% to 36,350 shares.   Later in May, Harvey Kapnick, who joined the firm in Aprilas vice chairman after serving on the executive compensationcommittee that formulated the bonus plan, bought 13,500shares for $525,855 in several purchases, SEC filings show.The purchase more than doubled his General Dynamics holdings.   Messrs. Kapnick and Anders, both of whom were unavailablefor comment, paid an average price of $39.01 a share. In NewYork Stock Exchange composite trading, General Dynamics stockclosed yesterday at $40.50, down $1.375, after hitting its52-week high on Monday of $41.875.   The other three company insiders purchased 1,000 to 2,300shares each, increasing their own holdings by 11% to 34%, SECfilings show.   General Dynamics insiders are proven good market-timers.As previously reported, Wall Street's collective eyebrowswere raised earlier this year when six General Dynamicsinsiders bought shares at about $25 a share shortly beforethe firm told brokerage houses about major changes under way.The news prompted &quot;buy&quot; recommendations that boosted thestock's price.   General Dynamics stock has had a good run so far thisyear, analysts said, due to positive investor sentimentrelated to the Gulf War, the firm's winning of three defensecontract awards within three months and signs that managementis becoming more sensitive to the company's stock price. But&quot;I still question the company's ability, longer-term, tomaintain earnings when revenues are going to decline 30%&quot; dueto the federal government's planned cuts in defense spending,said Steve Binder, a Bear, Stearns Cos. analyst.   ---   SECOND WAVE: Two companies that have recently experiencedclusters of insider selling saw more last week, SEC filingsshow.
