Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $400.30 for atroy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $2.70 from late Tuesday's$397.60.   On the Commodity Exchange, a troy ounce of gold rose to $400.80from $398.10 on Tuesday.   Gold prices rose as traders followed the fortunes of crude oilfutures, said Jim Paul, director of futures research at Dean WitterReynolds Inc. in Chicago.   Bullion traders have been selling recently as the price of oilplunged. Lower oil prices are a harbinger of lower inflation andreduce the attractiveness of gold, which is a traditional hedgeagainst higher inflation.   Oil prices continued to skid Wednesday, but Paul said goldtraders were heartened by the fact that the near-term contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, struggled backfrom its lows of the day. The contract closed down 47 cents at$12.60 a barrel, after having been down nearly 80 cents at onepoint.   ``The fact that (oil) was down 80 cents makes 40 cents look nottoo bad,'' Paul said.
