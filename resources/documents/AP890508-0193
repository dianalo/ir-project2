The police are scrambling to find out when andwhere.   Yoshinori Watanabe takes over as head of the Yamaguchi-gumisyndicate, a post that had been vacant for more than four yearsbecause of a gang war.   Watanabe, 48, a muscular gangster known for his crew-cut andviolent bent, was annointed by 13 members of the syndicate's ElderBrother Council in mid-April, according police in Kobe, a port cityin western Japan where the huge syndicate is based.   A police official there said that following the council'sdecision, more than 80 of the syndicate's top dons, who eachcontrol a network of sub-gangs, met at central headquarters April27 to give Watanabe their approval.   The move was expected, but police hope jockeying for posts inthe new hierarchy may lead to disunity. They are closely watchingwho will be appointed to executive ranks in the tightly knit empire.   ``The day after they made their decision, we held a meeting todiscuss tightening our crackdown,'' said Takashi Ishii, assistantdirector of the National Police Agency's Organized Crime ControlOffice.   ``Right now we are trying to gather information on who will bethe new leaders under Watanabe, while trying to make sure thegang's celebration is never held.''   Watanabe heads the powerful Kobe-based Yamaken gang, which has3,000 members, the largest single group within the Yamaguchi-gumiorganization. He is now facing charges involving an assaultcommitted in 1984. A verdict is expected May 26.   ``If he goes to jail it will only be for a short time, maybe ayear, and won't effect his position as boss,'' said an underworldsource. He added that having lived through four years without aboss, another year or so would pose no real problem for the gang.Watanabe is free on bail.   Watanabe is credited with single-handedly negotiating an end toa conflict with the Ichiwa-kai gang and forcing its boss to retire.Police reported more than two dozen deaths in 315 armed incidentsduring the four-year battle, making it the bloodiest ever inJapan's underworld.   The Ichiwa-kai, which had 6,000 members at its peak, was createdin June, 1984, after an internal dispute over Yamaguchi-gumileadership led to a revolt. Fear of a similar split, and an equalbalance of power between Watanabe and Acting Boss Kazuo Nakanishi,66, helped keep the gang from naming a new boss until Watanabeended the ``Yama-Ichi War'' in late March.   In keeping with underworld custom, leaders of the gang hope theWatanabe ceremony will usher in a new era and publicly reaffirmtheir establishment status.   ``It's an important matter of face for both the police and thegang because the Yamaguchi-gumi wants to use the party todemonstrate its power,'' said the underworld source. ``The policewant to stop them, or if they can't, force them to simplify theceremony.''   When the last inauguration was held in Naruto on the southernisland of Shikoku in 1985, about 1,000 police surrounded themeeting place but had no grounds to stop it. More than 300gangsters, dressed in formal black suits or kimono, attended thatrite, part of which was televised. No incidents were reported.   In most Japanese gangs, members have complex ``family''relations created at elaborate ceremonies where participants sipsake to seal their vows of fidelity. Through these rites, gangstersdevelop intricate elder and younger brother relationships, anddedicate their lives to their father, or boss.   Police estimate overall gang membership in Japan at about 90,000and say nearly half are affiliated with the three largestnationwide syndicates _ the Yamaguchi-gumi, the Sumiyoshi Rengo andthe Inagawa-Kai.   Japanese underworld operations range from extortion and illicitgambling to the drug and sex trades. They are also often involvedin construction, real estate, money laundering and entertainment.   Though the Yamaguchi-gumi's activities are primarily domestic,police have said it has close relations with Taiwan's United Bamboogang, which allegedly produces stimulants for illicit sale inJapan. Strict gun-control laws have also sent Japanese gangs abroadin their search for weapons, many of which come from the UnitedStates and the Philippines.   National police officials say a full-scale expansion of Japanesegangs abroad is constricted by the lack of large Japanese-speakingcommunities and add that, aside from the gun and drug trade,operations outside Japan often center on Japanese tourists.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs May 15</NOTE></DOC>
