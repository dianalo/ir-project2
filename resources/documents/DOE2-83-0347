This hegemoniccognitive structure-the developmentalist paradigm-was a necessary conditionsfor the legislative enactment of the California State Water Plan duringthe late 1950s. This study also demonstrates that the inability of politiciansduring the late 1970s and early 1980s to forge the political consensusnecessary to build the Peripheral Canal resulted from the evolution andconcretization of environmental and efficient water-use beliefs intoa competitive policy-making paradigm. The study concludes that, despitethe importance of factors external to the policy-making process in promotinglong-term policy change, new policies and institutions are also the functionof policy learning within the environmental movement and the concomitantwillingness of influential environmentalists to promote reforms basedon fundamental microeconomic principles. Enviroeconomists have playeda critical role in transferring modern economic principles from the universityinto the California water policy-making system.</TEXT></DOC>
