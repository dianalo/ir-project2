(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Laura Cooper McGovernandM;Local area networks (LANs), once viewed as specialized technology needed byonly a fraction of all microcomputer installations, can now be found at sevenout of 10 such installations, according to a recent PC Week survey.andP;  Givencurrent year-ahead purchase plans for new LANs, that survey indicates that bythe end of 1989, more than eight out of 10 sites will have at least one LANinstalled.andM;Moreover, installation of multiple LANs is also becoming increasinglycommonplace, with 46 percent of all sites currently having more than one LANon-site and 63 percent planning to put multiple LANs in place by the end of1989, according to the survey.andM;These observations are based on data from a recently completed PC Week surveyon LAN installation and purchase plans.andP;  The annual LAN surveys poll membersof PC Week's Corporate Advisory Panel on currently installed networks as wellas on installation plans for the next 12 months.andP;  A local area network isdefined for the purpose of these surveys as ''a group of individual PCslinked by a single common server.''andM;The PC Week Corporate Advisory Panel is composed of individuals who areresponsible for the purchase and support of microcomputer-related equipmentat more than 500 corporate and institutional microcomputer installationsacross the United States.andM;The 1987 survey on LANs, conducted in November of that year, found that 59percent of panel sites had at least one LAN installed, with 25 percent ofthat total having one LAN, 12 percent having two LANs and 22 percent havingthree or more LANs.andM;Year-ahead projections at that time indicated that by the end of 1988, 73percent of panel sites expected to have at least a single LAN installed.andP;  Ofthat 73 percent, 19 percent anticipated installing a single LAN, 14 percentplanned to install two LANs, and the remaining 40 percent had plans for threeor more LANs.andM;As the bar charts at the right indicate, these 1987 projections were largelymet during 1988.andP;  According to the current survey, by the end of 1988, 70percent of panel sites had installed at least one LAN.andP;  Of that total, 24percent had installed one LAN, 13 percent had installed two LANs and 33percent had installed three or more LANs.andM;If 1988's projections by panel members prove as accurate as those of 1987, bythe end of this year, 81 percent of panel sites will have installed at leastone LAN.andP;  More significantly, while only 18 percent of panel sites will ownjust one LAN, 50 percent will have three or more -- meaning that multipleLANs will clearly be the rule at U.S.andP;  micro installations.andM;More Common at Large SitesandM;While the trend toward LAN acquisition is clearly evident at all panel sites,data from the current survey indicates that both existing and planned LANsare slightly more common at large sites (those sites with more than 250 PCs)than at medium-sized sites (those sites that have 100 to 249 PCs).andM;Moreover, considerably more current and projected LAN ownership was foundamong either large or medium-sized panel sites than among those with lessthan 100 PCs.andM;Currently, 84 percent of large sites and 77 percent of medium-sized ones haveat least one LAN installed, compared with 59 percent of small sites.andM;Similarly, between 89 percent and 90 percent of both large and medium-sizedsites project having at least one LAN by the end of 1989, compared with 75percent of small sites.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
