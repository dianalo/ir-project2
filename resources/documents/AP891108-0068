Financial analysts predict the Fed action means that most banksare likely to cut their 10.5 percent prime lending rate to 10percent, probably before the end of the week, according to today'seditions of The Washington Post.   Sources told the Post the decision to cut short-term rates wasmade Monday during a telephone conference call meeting of the Fed'stop policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee.   Later that day, the nation's central bank began to supply extracash to the banking system and followed Tuesday with a similar move,the newspaper said. Those actions resulted in the federal funds ratebeing lowered from 8.75 percent to just over 8.5 percent, the papersaid.   The federal funds rate is the interest rate financialinstitutions charge one another on overnight loans. Its levelbroadly determines most other short-term interest rates.   The drop in the federal funds rate is the fifth since the Fedbegan to loosen its control on credit at the end of May, whichmarked the reversal of a yearlong effort to hold down inflation byslowing growth. The most recent previous cut came last month after asharp drop in the stock market.   The Post said that in Monday's decision, Fed officials wereresponding to recent statistics that have convinced many economiststhat growth will drop to the 1 percent or 2 percent range by earlynext year, the lowest since 1986.   The Federal Reserve did not announce its decision and a Fedspokesman declined to comment on whether the central bank hadchanged its policy, the newspaper said.</TEXT></DOC>
