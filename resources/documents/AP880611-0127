Hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinian students battled Israelitroops in the most widespread protests since the army opened highschools last week in the West Bank after they had been closed forfour months.   In the Gaza Strip, a 9-year-old Arab boy was hospitalized with askull fracture suffered when Israeli soldiers fired rubber bulletsin his direction from a distance of about six feet, said a doctorat Gaza City's Ahli Arab Hospital.   The doctor said the youngster was hit by rubber bullets in thehead, chest and right shoulder and three of the boy's relativeswere treated for minor rubber-bullet wounds.   An Arab reporter said the boy was hit when soldiers opened fireto disperse a crowd trying to stop them from beating a 17-year-oldArab youth in Gaza City.   The army confirmed the boy was hit by rubber bullets and saidthe circumstances were under investigation.   Firefighters have blamed Palestinian militants for setting morethan half of about 400 fires that have ravaged at least 35,000acres of forests and farms since early May.   David Angel of the Jewish National Fund, which manages Israeliforests, said at least three of Saturday's major fires were causedby arson.   He said a helicopter crew spotted two Arab teen-agers setting ablaze with torches and rags near the communal farm Maalei Hahamishanorthwest of Jerusalem and police arrested one of the youths.   Another Arab was arrested as a suspected arsonist in northernIsrael, Angel said.   Israel radio reported police arrested three residents of theArab village of Jisr ez Zarqua in northern Israel on suspicion ofarson. It was not immediately clear if the detainee Angel referredto was among the three.   In a leaflet issued last week, underground leaders of thePalestinian uprising urged Arabs to ``destroy and burn all theenemy's agricultural and industrial resources.''   In the West Bank city of Hebron, about 200 students shouting``Allahu Akhbar!'' Arabic for God is great, piled stones andburning tires on main roads through much of the city, an Arabreporter said.   The students threw stones and soldiers fired in the air to endthe hour-long protest, said the reporter, speaking on condition ofanonymity. There were no reports of injuries.   Dozens of Arab students also demonstrated in the West Bankcities of Ramallah and El Bireh, the reporter said.   An army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmedprotests in Hebron. He did not elaborate and said he had no reportsof student demonstrations elsewhere.   The army closed the West Bank's nearly 1,200 schools inFebruary, saying they had become centers of violence. The schoolswere gradually reopened in the past three weeks, and high schoolclasses resumed Monday.   At least 204 Palestinians and two Israelis have been killedsince Dec. 8, when the Arab uprising began in the territories thatIsrael captured in the 1967 Middle East war.   A military source said the army might reclose some schools wheredisturbances persisted but had no immediate plans to shut down thewhole West Bank school system.   Jerusalem police spokesman Rafi Levy said authorities detained aman seen setting a fire near the communal farm Maalei Hahamishanorthwest of Jerusalem. Angel said police also arrested an Arabsuspected of starting a forest fire in northern Israel's LowerGalilee region. Fires also were reported near coastal cities ofAshkelon and Haifa.   In Jerusalem, the attorney for Mubarak Awad, an Arab-Americanadvocate of civil disobedience, said Awad vowed to physicallyresist efforts to deport him. Under a Supreme Court ruling, Awadcan be expelled at midnight, but Israeli officials refused to saywhen he would be deported.   Awad's Palestinian lawyer, Jonathan Kuttab, met with Awad forabout 20 minutes on Saturday.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ordered Awad deported in May,saying he helped incite the Arab uprising.   Awad, 44, has said he supported civil disobedience againstIsrael but was opposed to violent forms of protest. TheJerusalem-born Awad became a U.S. citizen during a 13-year stay inthe United States but returned to Israel in 1983 to found theCenter for the Study of Non-Violence.</TEXT></DOC>
