The CNN report said that if all 17 legal successors to the presidentwere incapacitated, non-elected officials would assume office in extremeemergencies.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  REAGAN PLANNED FOR 'DAY AFTER'SECRET LIST INCLUDED NON-ELECTED LEADERS AFTERDEVASTATION  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Among government officials at the time who were designated to serve assuccessors in an expanded list were the White House chief of staff forPresident Reagan, Howard Baker; the CIA director, Richard Helms; U.N.Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick; and a former defense secretary, JamesSchlesinger, the CNN report said.;   In a telephone interview, Helms refusedto discuss the classified program or his involvement but said he was notfamiliar with &quot;bringing in people from outside of government&quot; to serve aspresidential successors.;   A leading constitutional scholar who appeared onthe CNN broadcast, Professor William Van Alstyne, of Duke University, said thesecrecy surrounding the plan could undermine its credibility if it ever had tobe put into effect. Who would believe an obscure figure claiming to bepresident under a top-secret plan no one had ever heard of, he asked.;   Thesecret agency, the National Program Office, was created by Reagan in 1982 toexpand the list of successors and a network of bunkers, aircraft and mobilecommand centers to ensure that the government continued to function in anuclear war and afterward. Oliver North, then a Marine lieutenant colonel andan aide on the National Security Council, was a central figure in establishingthe secret program, CNN said.;   The issue of maintaining civilian,constitutional government during and after a nuclear attack has been a highpriority for at least the last three administrations, although it was alwaysrecognized as a remote possibility. The recent thaw in East-West tensions hasmade such a strike more improbable. Moreover, many questions about the plan'soperation remained unanswered by administration officials, who were reluctantto discuss the classified program.;   In the late 1970s, President Carterdirected Zbigniew Brzezinski, his national security adviser, to draw up a listof people to be evacuated from the White House in the event of an imminentnuclear strike. Those officials were then to fan out across the country onairborne command posts and mobile command centers.;   Reagan inherited theframework of the plan and authorized its expansion. That expansion includedcreation of the National Program Office, run by then Vice President GeorgeBush, CNN reported.;   &quot;It's a very elaborate plan to protect the leaders ofgovernment when the country is under attack,&quot; Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., saidSunday. &quot;You put them in air and get them to hideaway locations, with specialcommunication systems so the government can function.&quot;;   Hamilton, who waschairman of the House Intelligence Committee in 1985 and 1986, said he was notfamiliar with any extra-Constitutional succession provisions.;   The currentstatus of such a plan was not made clear in the CNN report.;   But it said theUnited States had spent more than $8 billion on the National Program Officesince 1982, much of the money on advanced communications equipment designed tosurvive a nuclear blast. The communications systems were technically flawed,however, and prevented the State Department, Defense Department, CentralIntelligence Agency, and Federal Emergency Management Agency from being ableto &quot;talk to each other,&quot; according to CNN.;   The law on presidentialsuccession makes the order: the vice president, speaker of the House,president pro tem of the Senate, and the 14 Cabinet officers in order of thecreation of their posts, beginning with the secretaries of state, the Treasuryand defense and succeeding to the newest department, Veterans Affairs.;  Administration officials Sunday refused to discuss the secret succession planor the National Program Office.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Home  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911118  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  666  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, November 18, 199100323096,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
