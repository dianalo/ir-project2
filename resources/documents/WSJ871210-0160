Snyder's op-ed piece, Nov. 18), one should bear in mind the following:    1.Aircraft carriers are something of an alternative to bases in territories of uncertain allies. With today's munitions, the fighter-bombers on our carriers can perform missions that used to require large numbers of planes operating from land bases.    2.Aircraft carriers have a high initial capital cost and a high annual operating cost, particularly with their protecting groups, but they are not subject to the hundreds of millions of dollars of annual &quot;rent&quot; -- a k a extortion -- demanded by some host countries for base rights. Furthermore, you can easily withdraw a carrier, while an abandoned base may end up being used by our adversaries.    3.When one is at the threshold of war, carriers are less provocative than land bases. The British refrained from reinforcing their Falklands base for fear of exciting Argentina. Had they been able to quietly float up a &quot;fully capable&quot; carrier, Argentina would have been unable to attack the Falklands. And think how complicated it would be for us to use Kuwaiti territory to mount a strike against Iran.    4.At the outbreak of a conventional war, carriers are less vulnerable than land bases, which are subject to attacks by Spetsnaz troops on the homes of pilots and, using mortars, on the bases themselves, followed by paratroop drops -- none of which work against carriers. Air-base operability is, indeed, one of our most acute military problems.    5.Gary Hart and others have argued for a larger number of smaller carriers -- one of that great man's &quot;new ideas&quot; is actually a very old idea. However, a large &quot;fully capable&quot; carrier is roughly twice as cost-efficient as a small one, since both have to be protected, and there are important sensitive installations that have to be duplicated in full in any carrier, large or small; in other words, you can't just shrink everything pro rata.    6.Against nuclear-missile attack, carriers are vulnerable, but would have a longer life expectancy than land bases.    7.Land bases, upon the outbreak of even &quot;low-intensity&quot; hostilities, require ground forces to protect them from, e.g., mortar attack.    There have been dozens of occasions since World War II when we have had to use carriers, without any being lost to enemy action; we have, on the contrary, lost many land bases.
