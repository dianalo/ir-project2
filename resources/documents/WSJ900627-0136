Our country, which continuesto bleed and suffer pain, needs democracy,&quot; he said in a35-minute speech that was interrupted by applause 18 times.</LP><TEXT>   In his appearance on Capitol Hill, Mr. Mandela, ANC deputypresident, thanked Congress for the sanctions legislation&quot;which made such a decisive contribution to the process ofmoving our country forward towards negotiations.&quot;   He said it was encouraging to know that Congress and theBush administration agree &quot;that sanctions should remain inplace. The purpose for which they were imposed has not yetbeen achieved.&quot;   Under U.S. law, the economic sanctions that were imposedin 1986 will remain in place until certain conditions aremet, including a full lifting of the South African state ofemergency and the release of political prisoners.   But Mr. Mandela urged the lawmakers to &quot;go further andassist us with the material resources which will enable us topromote the peace process and meet other needs which arisefrom the changing situation you have helped bring about.&quot;   Mr. Mandela did not ask Congress for a specific amount ofmoney. Congress already has approved a total of $42 millionto assist efforts to develop democracy in South Africa.   After the speech, House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich ofGeorgia said Mr. Mandela's refusal to renounce violence alongwith earlier comments supportive of Cuba, Libya and thePalestine Liberation Organization &quot;dooms any plausiblechance&quot; of U.S. aid to the ANC. The South African activisthas said leaders of Cuba and Libya and the PLO backed theANC's anti-apartheid struggle when the U.S. wouldn't.   Mr. Gingrich called yesterday's speech more &quot;balanced&quot;than Mr. Mandela's earlier statements.   Democratic Whip William Gray of Pennsylvania said Mr.Mandela's earlier comments wouldn't hurt efforts to providefunds to the ANC. &quot;Most members of Congress, except theradical right, will recognize this is a fight againstapartheid, a fight against racism,&quot; he said.   Mr. Mandela asked President Bush Monday for financialassistance but was told the U.S. would not contributedirectly to a political party, according to a statedepartment official. The ANC could receive U.S. funds, if itrenounces violence in the course of negotiations, through theNational Endowment for Democracy, a privately administeredbut publicly funded organization that promotes democracyaround the world.   Included in the House chamber were members of PresidentBush's cabinet, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the diplomaticcommunity. They joined with Mr. Mandela's supporters ingiving him a standing ovation when he said: &quot;Peace will notcome to our country and region until the apartheid system isended.&quot;   Invoking the names of George Washington, Thomas Jeffersonand Abraham Lincoln, as well as figures in the fight forblack rights in the U.S., Mr. Mandela attempted to assure thelawmakers that they would be comfortable with a South Africaled by the ANC.   He said that the ANC is struggling &quot;to ensure that therights of every individual are guaranteed and protectedthrough a democratic constitution, the rule of law, anentrenched bill of rights, which should be enforced by anindependent judiciary, as well as a multiparty politicalsystem.&quot;   The organization is not wedded to nationalization,according to Mr. Mandela, who added that some governmentintervention will be necessary to bolster the economy andmake it more equitable.   He said it was a given &quot;that the private sector is anengine of growth and development, which is critical to thesuccess of the mixed economy we hope to see in the futureSouth Africa.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
