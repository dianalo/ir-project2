The agency, the London-based investment-management arm of the Kuwaiti government, has bought partly paid shares of the British oil giant aggressively over the past six weeks. Earlier yesterday, a spokeswoman for the agency said it had raised its BP holding on Tuesday to 17.4% from 17.1%.    Based on the difference between Tuesday's stake and yesterday's, the agency likely bought nearly 38 million shares yesterday. That would account for nearly all the trading volume yesterday in BP's partly paid shares on London's stock exchange. The volume, which tallies both stock purchases and sales, was a heavy 77 million shares.    BP yesterday said it remains happy to have the Kuwaiti agency as an institutional investor. The agency has said it views its BP stake as a long-term investment.    Analysts speculated that the agency would continue buying BP shares until it obtains a holding of roughly 25%. Under British regulations, the agency can buy as much as 29.9% without having to launch a takeover bid. Such a bid remains unlikely because of political opposition, and concern about such opposition probably will keep the Kuwaitis from raising their stake above even 25%, analysts said.    BP's partly paid shares rose half a penny in London yesterday, to 70.5 pence ($1.31). Yesterday's price values the Kuwaiti stake at about #761.4 million ($1.42 billion). Analysts predicted that BP's share price would fall to about 65 pence after next Wednesday, when the British government ends its offer to buy back the partly paid shares for 70 pence each. The government devised the price-support plan to bolster its #7.24 billion offer of BP shares soon after the October market crash. </TEXT></DOC>
