Robert Koontz, theformer general manager of a Burroughs disk manufacturing plant, and SF2'sDirector of Engineering is Tom Idleman, who, along with his former employer,Memorex, holds the premier patent for caching in a storage subsystem.andM;SF2 Corp. can be contacted at Box 60066, 140 Kife Court, Sunnyvale, CA 94086,(408) 730-1664.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
