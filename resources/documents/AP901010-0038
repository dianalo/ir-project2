Park ranger Jim Van Dorin led visitors Tuesday on one of thefirst tours of Independence Hall since it was locked up. Back ondisplay were George Washington's chair and the silver inkstand usedby signers of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.   ``That's what gives us the Congress we have today,'' he said ofthe Constitution. ``I won't go any farther than that.''   The three-day impasse had locked doors at Independence Hall andother National Park Service sites across the country.   David Head of Florence, Ky., said he blamed Congress for notpassing budget legislation soon enough to avoid a shutdown. Askedif anyone had won his vote during the budget wrangling, he said,``Yes, anyone new.''   The government lost its authority to spend money Saturday afterCongress rejected a White House spending plan for the fiscal yearthat began Oct. 1. Non-essential services were halted during thethree-day Columbus Day weekend, hitting tourist sites the hardest.   The emergency spending bill that President Bush signed Tuesdayfailed to convince many people the problem had been solved. Thebill is effective until Oct. 19. By then, congressional leadershope to work out a deficit-reducing budget.   ``I think we're all pleased to be still employed this morning,but we've only got a 10-day reprieve,'' said Richard G. Ring,superintendent of Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area nearStroudsburg. ``We're hoping that things sort themselves out on apermanent basis for the coming fiscal year.''   ``It's not the best way to run a park,'' Warren Beach,superintendent of Valley Forge National Historical Park in suburbanPhiladelphia, said of the temporary bill.   People had also been turned away from the Gettysburgbattlefield.   ``It's just a shame that lots of our visiting people, both fromthis country and as well from other countries, were really deniedthe opportunity to see some of our heritage,'' said James C. Roach,the battlefield's chief of interpretation and visitor services.   In St. Louis, children on a field trip to the St. Louis Arch gotto see what they came for.   `If it hadn't been open, the students were going to writePresident Bush and Congress telling them how it affected theireducation,'' said Nancy Scargall, a teacher at Wren Hollow Schoolin St. Louis County.</TEXT></DOC>
