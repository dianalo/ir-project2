It takes planning and alertness, but it does work, and it canchange your cooking and eating patterns for good.;   Here are somecost-cutting tips:;   (box) Eat at home -- always. Cut out deli runs orfast-food stops. It's always cheaper to eat at home, even if it means zappingsome soup or making a quick sandwich.;   (box) Plan your food shopping.
