These proposed rates are applicable onlyto discretionary or coordination sales that are short-term commitmentsof 1 year or less. Coordination sales represent short-term firm or nonfirmpower that is available over and above normal marketing obligations.Western is in the process of joining the Western Systems Power Pool (WSPP),and the proposed rates will be based on WSPP rates. The Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission has approved the methodologies for developing therate for each type of service offered under WSPP. The actual rate for eachtransaction is negotiated by the buyer and the seller. Summaries of pertinentportions of WSPP Service Schedule A (Economy Energy Service), Service ScheduleC (Firm System Capacity/Energy Sale or Exchange Service), and Service ScheduleD (Transmission Service) are included as exhibits I, II, and III, respectively,and provide details of the approved methodologies. The current maximumvalue for each type of service is: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,r25</C> <H1>Service </H1><H1>Maximum Value</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Economy Sale<D>245 mills per kWh. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Economy Exchange <D>100:1. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Firm Capacity/Energy Sale <D>245 mills per kWh. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Firm Capacity/Energy Exchange <D>100:1. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Transmission <D>33 mills per kWh. </D></ITAG></ITAG>The rates for Economy Energy Service and the Transmission Service wouldapply to both WSPP and non-WSPP transactions whereas the rate for Short-TermSystem Capacity/Energy Sale or Exchange Service would apply only to WSPPtransactions. The Economy Energy Service rate would be used as an alternative to thecurrently utilized Fuel Replacement Energy rate. Fuel Replacement Energyas a class of service would be retained. Short-term nonfirm surplus energysold as Fuel Replacement Energy is, for utilities with generation, pricedat 85 percent of the cost of the saved fuel plus 50 percent of any othersavings realized by the purchaser. Fuel Replacement Energy sold to utilitieswithout generation is priced at 85 percent of the purchaser's highest costalternative source of energy. Because of the present-day situation of highlycompetitive markets, the pricing of Fuel Replacement Energy against savedfuel cost at a specific fossil-fuel plant is not as viable as it once was.Western's objective remains that of utilizing short-term hydro surplusesto conserve fossil fuel. Western proposes an Economy Energy Service ratebased upon short-term energy pricing among power suppliers be adopted andcontinued as long as Western determines it is appropriate. The proposedEconomy Energy Service rate is as follows: The rate for Economy EnergyService is based upon the pricing for nonfirm energy sales among the powersuppliers within the interconnected systems. The Sort-Term Firm Capacity/Energy Sale or Exchange Service rate wouldbe applicable to Western's sales of short-term firm capacity and energysuch as when power has been offered to, but not taken by, Western's preferencecustomers. Typically, Western has made such sales utilizing the appropriatecomponent of its established firm power rate and will continue to do soif and when deemed appropriate. However, the adoption of this Short-TermFirm Capacity/Energy Sale or Echange Service rate would provide Westernwith enhanced operational and economic flexibility in its marketing offirm power for short-term commitments. This rate would be utilized forWSPP commitments of less than 1 year and would be as follows: The ratefor Short-Term System Capacity/Energy Sales or Exchange Service is basedupon the pricing for firm capacity and energy sales among the participantsof the Western Systems Power Pool. The Nonfirm Transmission Service rate would be an alternative to the currentnonfirm transmission rate of 1.4 mills per kWh provided by Rate SchedulePD-NFT2, Parker-Davis Project, Schedule of Rates for Nonfirm TransmissionService, and would replace Rate Schedule SP-NFT2, Colorado River StorageProject, Rate Schedule for Nonfirm Transmission Service, 3.1 mills perkWh. The proposed rate for Nonfirm Transmission Service is as follows:The rates for Nonfirm Transmission Service are based upon the pricing fornonfirm transmission among the participants within the interconnected system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> begins a 30-day public comment and consultationperiod.

It markets and transmits powerin 15 Central and Western States, primarily from Federal hydroelectricpowerplants. The BCAO and SLCAO market the power generated from severalhydroelectric powerplants which are primarily located in the Upper andLower Colorado River Basins. In addition, the BCAO markets a portion ofthe generation from the Navajo coal-fired powerplant of the Central ArizonaProject. The power marketing functions of both offices include transmissionservice as well as power sales. The transmission systems provide interconnectionsbetween Federal powerplants as well as interconnections between variousFederal, public, and investor-owned utility systems. Western markets bothfirm and nonfirm power and transmission service. Western is in the process of joining the WSPP, subject to Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission approval of a 2-year extension of the WSPP program.WSPP provides its members the ability to enter into power transactionsbased on day-to-day market activities. It does not preclude transactionsthrough other agreements. The proposed rates will be used by Western forWSPP and non-WSPP transactions as appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="84">Economy Energy Service</ITAG>Western sells short-term surplus energy to entities that reduce power productionfrom fossil-fueled powerplants to conserve fuel. Selling surplus energyat 85 percent of a plant's fuel cost provided a basis for pricing and couldbe adhered to when a specific unit could easily be identified and the priceof the energy directly related to the fuel saved. However, present-daysituations in the utility industry have changed from when the sale of fuelreplacement energy was initiated more than 20 years ago. Today, major utilitieshave numerous plants in daily operation which have a wide range of operatingcosts. Because of multiple-unit operations, utilities often reduce powergeneration of more than one unit when buying energy from another utility.A utility's highest cost unit is not always the one reduced in power levelbecause of such considerations as ``take or pay'' coal contracts or transmissionconstraints. Minimum power levels of large plants also affect which unitsmay be backed down. Economic dispatch has evolved among utilities in order to improve the economicutilization of both generation and transmission facilities. The centralizedcommunication and pricing flexibility available through WSPP may lead togreater coordination of interconnected system operation achieving manyof the benefits of centralized economic dispatch. Because of this, andother considerations, pricing of short-term energy transactions among powersuppliers is driven by factors other than fuel savings at a particularplant. It is increasingly more difficult, and less significant, for Westernto base short-term surplus energy prices on fuel savings associated witha specific generating unit.Western considers that some short-term surplus energy sales, previouslyconducted as Fuel Replacement Energy sales, can be more appropriately conductedunder the proposed category of Economy Energy. Quantifiable conservationof fuel will still be accomplished but the energy prices will directlyreflect all factors which establish short-term energy prices among thermalsuppliers.Short-Term Firm Capacity/Energy Sale or Exchange ServiceFrom time to time, the BCAO and the SLCAO have firm power available forcoordination transactions; i.e., firm power that is available over andabove the normal marketing obligations. Such power, committable for lessthan 1 year, may be either peaking only or peaking with energy. The energymay or may not be marketed on an exchange basis. The rate for this servicewould be an alternative to using one or more of the components of the thencurrent firm power rates. Although the Short-Term Firm Capacity/EnergySales or Exchange Service rate might enhance Western revenues, its mostlikely role would be to provide Western with increased marketing flexibility.Nonfirm Transmission ServiceThe BCAO and the SLCAO provide nonfirm transmission service on an ``asavailable'' basis. Any revenues generated from nonfirm transmission helpoffset the cost of constructing, operating, and maintaining the transmissionsystem.Western continues to improve system transfer capability through investmentin new lines and equipment such as phase-shifting transformers. If a fixednonfirm wheeling rate is too high, it may not encourage the efficient useof Western's future available transmission system capacity. If the rateis too low, it may not result in fair compensation to Western. A flexiblenonfirm transmission rate is a way to encourage the most efficient andeconomical use of Western's transmission systems.Power rates for Western are established pursuant to the Department of EnergyOrganization Act of August 4, 1977 (42 U.S.C. 7101, <T3>et seq.</T3>); the Reclamation Act of 1902 (43 U.S.C. 372, <T3>et seq.</T3>), as amended and supplemented by subsequent enactments,particularly section 9(c) of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 (43 U.S.C.485(c)); and the acts specifically applicable to the project system involved.Delegation Order No. 0204-108, effective May 30, 1986 (51 FR 19744, May30, 1986), as amended, delegated to the Administrator of Western the authorityto develop and place in effect, on a final basis, power and transmissionrates for short-term sales; i.e., sales less than 1 year in duration.After receipt of formal written comments, and due considerations, a finaldecision on the proposed rates will be made by the Administrator of Westernpursuant to authority delegated to the Administrator in Delegation OrderNo. 0204-108, as amended. An explanation responding to the major commentsand alternatives offered during the comment period shall accompany thefinal decision.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Compliance</ITAG>Western will conduct an analysis of the proposed rate pursuant to the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969, Council on Environmental Quality Regulations,and section D of the Department of Energy Guidelines published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 23, 1982 (47 FR 7976).<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq.</T3>), each agency, when required by 5 U.S.C. 553 to publisha proposed rule, is further required to prepare and make available forpublic comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis to describe theimpact of the proposed rule on small entities. Under 5 U.S.C. 601(2), ratesor services of particular applicability are not considered ``rules'' withinthe meaning of the Act. Because the rate is for services provided by Westernfrom particular projects, no flexibility analysis is required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Determination Under Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The Department of Energy has determined that this is not a major rule becauseit does not meet the criteria of section 1(b) of Executive Order 12291(46 FR 13193 February 17, 1981). In addition, Western has an exemptionfrom sections 3, 4, and 7 of Executive Order 12291, and therefore willnot prepare a regulatory impact statement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued at Golden, Colorado, March 30, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William H.
