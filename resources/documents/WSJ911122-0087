The chain of 33 hotels is one of the crown jewels offormer East Germany, and its sale became the focus of anintense tug of war, pitting developers and hotel companiesagainst the Treuhandanstalt, the state privatization agencycharged with selling it. Until earlier this week, the leadingbid was being offered by Sixt, a Munich car rental concern.</LP><TEXT>   Industry sources say Sixt pulled out of the running lateTuesday. The Treuhandanstalt was scheduled to make its finaldecision on the sale today. With Sixt out of the way, theleading contender appears to be Klingbeil Group, a Berlindevelopment firm.   It's not clear why Sixt dropped out of the running. SomeGerman politicians have campaigned against a sale to Sixt,arguing it would send the wrong signal to foreign investorsif prize properties in eastern Germany were kept inexclusively German hands. But the appearance that Klingbeilis the frontrunner undermines that argument.   Sixt, a relatively small and fast-growing company, mayhave found it impossible to finance the huge debt it wouldhave to incur to pay for the hotels. The company also has noexperience in managing hotels. Sixt officials couldn't bereached for comment.   The final price on the deal is unclear, but it's certainto exceed 2.5 billion marks.</TEXT></DOC>
