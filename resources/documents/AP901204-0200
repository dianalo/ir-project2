Hawaii Leaders Seek Huge Fees From Golf Course Developers</HEAD><BYLINE>By BRUCE DUNFORD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Japanese demand for golf, Hawaii's sunny climateand a limited supply of land for housing have political leadershere asking for up to $100 million as par for the course.   The idea to charge golf course developers ``community impactfees'' to pay for rental housing has drawn support of Gov. JohnWaihee and Honolulu Mayor Frank Fasi.   Supporters call it a way to force developers - who stand to makehuge profits exploiting Hawaii's limited land - to give somethingback to the community. Critics say it's a tempting but legallyquestionable scheme to tax developers under the guise of state andcounty land-use regulations.   With about 50 golf courses being proposed statewide by variousdevelopers - many of them Japanese - proceeds to the localgovernment under the plan could climb well into the billions ofdollars. Some developers are ready to pay.   Jurigi Co. of Japan agreed to pay Honolulu $111 million for ajust-completed $40 million municipal golf course near Pearl Harborand $200 million more in community impact fees for permission tobuild two more courses on Oahu, where Honolulu is located.   The City Council rejected the proposal, but its chairman, ArnoldMorgado, agrees with the concept.   In September, Morgado, the governor and the mayor said golfcourses take up land that could be used for housing, and ``requirelarge tracts of undeveloped land at or near locations which havescenic, recreational or cultural significance to the community.''Fasi said the fees would be subject to negotiation.   Hawaii's leaders are trying to cash in on high-pricedmemberships in Hawaii golf courses being peddled in Japan.   For instance, Shinwa Golf Corp., owner of the Wailea Resort onthe island of Maui, has offered Japanese citizens 1,000 membershipsat $115,000 each in a new Wailea golf course.   University of Hawaii Professor David Callies, an expert onland-use law, said impact fees have been found unconstitutionalwhen they exceed a development's actual effect on such things asroads, sewers and the environment.   ``Impact fees are not revenue-raising tools and golf courses areappropriate open space uses in the right places,'' Callies said.   ``It is difficult to see how a golf course generates $100million in infrastructure costs, which is the sole legal basis forcharging such a fee,'' he said.   Dan Davidson, executive director of the Land Use ResearchFoundation, a research and trade organization for landowners anddevelopers, said impact fees are tempting from a fiscal standpoint.   ``It is, however, a tax and the city has no authority to imposethis sort of tax in the guise of a land-use regulation,'' he said.   Harold Masumoto, director of the state's planning office, saidHawaii could avoid the potential problem of linking golf coursefees to actual impacts by entering into development agreements.   That way it would not be an impact fee, but a mutual agreementby the developer to make a contribution to a rental housing fund,he said.   In 1988, the state Land Use Commission decided that majordevelopers had to make 60 percent of their homes ``affordable'' forlow- and middle-income families.   In August, the same group for the first time imposed thegovernor's new policy of requiring hotel and resort developers tocreate one non-tourism job for every hotel room they build, or paythe state $25,000 per room.   Wali Osman, director of research for the real estate firm Monroeandamp; Friedlander Inc., said the trend is a result of the state'sfrustration in handling housing problems and diversifying theeconomy through traditional means. He said exactions fromdevelopers won't solve the housing problems.   The state is going ahead anyway.   Last month, the Board of Land and Natural Resources proposedthat Minami Group USA pay $15 million in impact fees in exchangefor extending a permit to complete a $100 million golf course onland zoned for conservation use. The extension was needed becauserain had delayed construction.   An attorney for Minami told the board he doubted the legality ofthe new proposed assessments, but said his client wanted to be ``aresponsible neighbor'' and was willing to work with the state andlocal groups.</TEXT></DOC>
