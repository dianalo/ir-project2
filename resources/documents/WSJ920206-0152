As a rule, airline stocks fluctuate wildly. Changes infuel prices, exchange rates, the economy or the securitysituation can radically alter airline earnings, with shareprices adjusting accordingly.</LP><TEXT>   But as results are posted by British Airways PLC,Lufthansa and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, the main message isthe benefits of cutting costs. Analysts say these threeairlines represent the good, the bad and the mediocre of theEuropean industry's cost-cutting efforts.   On Tuesday, Lufthansa said it might post a group loss ofas much as 400 million marks ($250 million) for 1991. Thatsent its stock price into a free fall-dropping 4.7% Tuesdayand 4.5% more yesterday, when it closed at 162.8 marks inFrankfurt. In 1990, Lufthansa had a profit of 15 millionmarks.   The grim forecast came despite a profit of 145 millionmarks in the second quarter and 172 million marks in thethird quarter. The airline blames the poor performanceprimarily on a disastrous first quarter, when the PersianGulf War led to a pretax loss of 476 million marks, and itsinability to sell used aircraft in a depressed market.   Analysts don't dispute the negative impact of both events,but they say a third key factor is the airline's poorcost-cutting efforts. &quot;They are always announcing theirintention to do so, but are they really?&quot; asks Hans-PeterWodniok of James Capel andamp; Co.'s Frankfurt office.   That failure to act may be particularly harmful forLufthansa. &quot;They run one of the highest cost bases in theairline industry,&quot; says Mark McVicar of County NatWest inLondon.   In fact, Mr. Wodniok thinks Lufthansa may be headed fortrouble. The first quarter, with its low passenger traffic,is typically a poor one for the airlines, and the analystthinks price competition may be heating up. Those factorscould further harm Lufthansa's balance sheet. It's possible,Mr. Wodniok says, that Lufthansa's share price will fallbelow 100 marks, where it traded for part of last year.   KLM, meanwhile, releases results today for the fiscalthird quarter ended Dec. 31. Analysts expect near break-evenresults, with pessimists forecasting a loss of about 50million Dutch guilders ($27.9 million) and optimistspredicting a profit of about 30 million guilders.   Even pessimists, such as Mr. McVicar, think those are goodresults in a quarter when important markets such as the U.S.and Japan were depressed. KLM earns most of its revenue onlong-haul flights.   Much of the credit goes to cost-cutting at KLM. LastFebruary, the airline said it would cut 955 million guildersfrom annual spending within three years. In the year endingMarch 31, 1991, KLM's operating expenses totaled 6.84 billionguilders.   But James Halstead of Hoare Govett Ltd. in London pointsout that despite the elimination of 567 jobs, or 15% ofnonflight personnel, a major part of KLM's program involveskeeping costs steady while increasing productivity. As aresult, KLM's savings program will take even longer to showits full impact.   Nonetheless, Richard Brakenhoff of Pierson, Heldring andamp;Pierson N.V., an Amsterdam stockbroker, expects KLM earningsto get a boost from two other factors. He estimates that thedollar and the yen were about 9% higher than the guilderduring the third quarter, compared with a year earlier, thusboosting KLM's earnings in guilders. And he says the price ofjet fuel averaged about 70 cents a gallon in the quarter,compared with about $1.20 a gallon a year earlier, saving KLMan estimated 80 million guilders.   Despite the positive outlook for KLM, its shares fell 1.5guilders to 40 guilders in Amsterdam yesterday, a dropanalysts blamed on fears sparked by Lufthansa's statement aday earlier.   Regardless of KLM's earnings, analysts say its stock pricewill be driven more by news of the cooperation talks withBritish Airways. But such news isn't expected before Tuesday,when British Airways reports its fiscal third-quarterresults.   Analysts think the earnings report from British Airwayswill be encouraging. Unlike most other European carriers, theU.K. airline is expected to post a pretax profit in its thirdquarter ended Dec. 31, with estimates ranging from #20million ($36 million) to #70 million. In the yearearlierquarter, British Airways reported pretax profit of #340million.   &quot;They've taken such huge costs out, and they're stilltaking out costs,&quot; says County NatWest's Mr. McVicar.   British Airways was among the first to respond to the GulfWar and recession last year. Last February, the airline saidit would trim staff by 4,600 people, or 9%. Analysts say thatand other cost-cutting efforts will prove more important thanany swings in fuel prices and exchange rates.</TEXT></DOC>
