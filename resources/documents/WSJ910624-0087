Raychem, a diversified electronics and materials company,also said it will freeze salaries for a year and cancelbonuses of all managers and professional workers to reduceexpenses.</LP><TEXT>   Analysts had been expecting Raychem to break even for thequarter, or post a small gain. But the company, citingweaker-than-expected sales, said a loss is &quot;likely,&quot; thoughit declined to forecast the size.   Jerry H. Lebowitz, an analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., saidhe now expects a loss of 30 cents to 40 cents in the quarter,giving Raychem a deficit for the fiscal year of 25 cents to35 cents a share. In the year-ago quarter, Raychem had a lossof $13.6 million, or 38 cents a share, on revenue of $295million. For all of fiscal 1990, it posted a deficit of$111.4 million, or $3.12 a share.   Raychem, which still expects to post modest revenue gainsfor its fiscal fourth quarter, has been hurt by decliningcapital expenditures in the electric-power and defenseindustries. Even so, the company would be solidly in theblack were it not for its ambitious, and so far costly,effort to develop the basic equipment needed to deliveradvanced video, voice and information services into the home.By the end of next year, analysts expect Raychem to haveplowed roughly $300 million into the emerging business ofsupplying fiber-optic cable for the so-called &quot;local loop&quot;operated by telephone companies.   The payoff, if Raychem succeeds, could be huge. &quot;Thecompany is looking at a market with a multibillion-dollarpotential, which would dwarf their existing core businesses,&quot;said Mark Hassenberg, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp;Jenrette.   But Raychem faces big, global competitors, some of themJapanese, in this quest. &quot;They're playing with the big boys,but it's bleeding them dry,&quot; Mr. Hassenberg said.</TEXT></DOC>
