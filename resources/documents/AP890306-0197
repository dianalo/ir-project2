In the past year the number of new users of ``hard'' drugs, suchas heroin and cocaine, has increased dramatically and drug-relateddeaths have risen 52 percent to 673, according to the InteriorMinistry.   Government officials say about 80,000 people use hard drugs andthat more than 100,000 drug-related crimes were committed last year.   West Germany's drug dealers are linked to an internationalnetwork stretching from the Far East to North America, law officialssay.   From Frankfurt to West Berlin, from Munich to Hamburg, drugdealers operate on city streets while keeping an eye out forundercover police officers.   ``Finding a fix of heroin these days is as easy as buyingcandy,'' said a 37-year-old Hamburg addict who asked to remainanonymous.   ``I can't survive without drugs. My whole life is bad because ofdrugs, but knowing that makes me need a fix even more so I can feelbetter for at least a little while.''   Sometimes youths who haven't even reached adolescence are caughtselling drugs as deadly as heroin, according to health and lawofficials.   International health experts say they fear the situation willonly worsen in West Germany.   ``I'm very much afraid this could be the beginning of a newwave,'' Dr. Cees Goos, a specialist for the World HealthOrganization based in Copenhagen, Denmark, said in a telephoneinterview.   West German law officials say break-ins by drug addicts as wellas drug-related shootings are on the rise.   Drug abuse is also tearing up relations within West Germanfamilies as parents find themselves unable to bear the stress ofdealing with an addicted offspring.   Experts say a major reason for these problems is a worldwidedecrease in street prices of hard drugs, making it more affordablefor youths and others to go from marijuana or hashish to heroin orcocaine.   ``You can get a gram of heroin for 120 to 200 marks ($65 to$110), or a one-fix street bag for 30 marks ($16),'' saidKurt-Juergen Lange, a specialist at the Hamburg Health Departmentand one of the country's best-known experts in his field.   West Germany's relatively lax immigration policies have alsoaggravated the country's drug woes, experts say.   Hundreds of thousands of newcomers stream into West Germany everyyear. Some of them take to drug-dealing to support themselves,   ``The big dealers take advantage of the financial situation ofthe asylum-seekers and get them to sell drugs,'' said BerndMetterhausen, a Hamburg police spokesman and expert on the drugscene.   Drug abuse in West Germany appeared to be leveling off after theend of the 1970s, but experts say it has made a frightening rebound.   According to the Interior Ministry, the number of known peoplewho took hard drugs for the first time last year increased by 38percent, reaching 6,997.   Last year's 673 deaths surpassed the previous high of 623 in 1979.   No comparable figures for 1988 are available for the UnitedStates. The National Institute on Drug Abuse in Washington doesn'trecord all drug-related deaths in the United States but statisticsit has compiled from 75 medical examiners in 27 U.S. metropolitanareas showed 4,678 drug-related deaths in 1987.   The United States has a population of about 242 million peopleand West Germany about 62 million.   West German authorities use a combination of drug-education inschools, law enforcement, and therapy in its battle against the useof illegal substances.   Newly launched methadone treatment programs in some West Germancities reflect the country's ever-increasing concern about heroinaddiction. West German authorities resisted such programs inprevious years, saying there is no evidence it works.   Methadone, a synthetic drug, has been used in the United Statesto wean addicts away from heroin.   Law enforcement officials have also been stepping up theirefforts in the past year, hoping at least to put a dent in drugtrafficking.   West German authorities seized a total of 1,181 pounds of heroinlast year, up 64 percent from the year before, the Interior Ministrysays. The amount of confiscated cocaine increased by 66 percent to1,091 pounds, while 200 pounds of amphetamines were seized, up 42percent from 1987, according to the ministry.   In one of the more recent drug hauls, West Berlin police on Feb.21 found $1.9 million worth of heroin hidden in the cellar of a pub.It was the largest single confiscation of heroin ever made in thecity.   Metterhausen says dangerous drugs enter West Germany by any meansavailable to a smuggler _ from a container vessel with illegalsubstances hidden behind legal goods, to private cars with drugscleverly stashed in hard-to-inspect places.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs March 10</NOTE></DOC>
