The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond gained 21-32 point,or about $6.50 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, whichmoves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 9.03 percentfrom 9.08 percent on Thursday.   The Labor Department reported Friday that the civilianunemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in December, tying a 14-yearlow, from 5.4 percent in November. During the final month of 1988,279,000 new jobs were created.   Analysts said the job growth was no stronger than expected andtended to ease concerns that the economy might be overheating.Investors also focused on figures showing that average wagesremained flat at an average of $9.45 an hour.   ``That gives some support to the notion that we have a strongeconomy but it hasn't set off a new inflationary spiral yet,'' saidCarol Stone, an economist with Nomura Securities.   Bond prices also got a boost from the rising dollar. Foreignexchange dealers attributed some of the currency's strength to theemployment report because it indicated strength in the U.S. economyand raised the possibility of higher U.S. interest rates.   Market observers had said before the jobs report was releasedthat bond investors feared a substantial increase in non-farm jobswould set off a new round of inflation, which erodes the value offixed-income securities such as notes and bonds.   Inflationary pressures in turn could prompt the Federal Reserveto tighten credit by boosting interest rates.   But Marshall B. Front, an economist at the Chicago investment andmutual-fund management firm of Stein Roe andamp; Farnham, said that whilea number of factors point to a stronger economy, a number of otherindicators suggest the economy is slowing down.   While interest rates, including the prime lending rate, couldincrease slightly over the next few weeks, ``short-term rates are inthe process of cresting and we will see them begin to fall as moresigns of an economic slowdown begin to show,'' Front predicted.   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-termand intermediate government issues rose 1-32 point, intermediatematurities were 1-16 point to 5-16 point higher and long-term issuesgained between 7-32 point and | point, accordig to the financialinformation service Telerate Inc.   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in theprice of a bond with a $1,000 face value.

Corporate issues also were higher. Moody's Investment GradeCorporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporatebonds with maturities of five years or longer, advanced 0.93 to293.68.
