Officials said that at a meeting of the cabinet-level Economic Policy Council on Wednesday, council members appeared generally in favor of proposals to lower ceilings on payments to individual farms and to separate subsidies from crop production.    The aim of the &quot;decoupling&quot; proposal would be to stop encouraging crop surpluses that require the government to spend billions buying the excess crops.    Farm programs are expected to cost the government as much as $70 billion over fiscal years 1986 through 1988, and the White House has branded the cost as out of control. But despite congressional budget concerns, many farm-state lawmakers vigorously will resist such reductions in farm benefits.    The president didn't make any decisions at Wednesday's meeting and the size of any proposed cuts remains unclear. Also considered were reductions in &quot;target&quot; price levels, which are set by Congress as the basis for calculating farmers' income-protection subsidies.    Under the decoupling plan, farmers would be given crop subsidies based on past production and wouldn't have to plant their usual wheat, corn or other crops to qualify for the payment. Council members debated whether to let farmers plant other crops while getting their basic subsidy.    Meanwhile, in a reflection of the administration's own concern about farm-state politics, the president's budget for fiscal 1988, which starts Oct. 1, will propose a much smaller cut in federal funding for the popular Agricultural Extension Service than the administration sought a year ago.    Administration officials said Mr. Reagan's fiscal 1988 budget, which will be presented to Congress Jan. 5, will propose a cut of about 20% in spending authority for the Extension Service, which provides farmers, their families and rural communities with a wide range of services, including crop-planting advice, psychological counseling, meal planning, family budgeting and 4-H Clubs for children. The program also is supported by state and local funds.    For fiscal 1987, the administration first considered eliminating the federal contribution altogether, then proposed a 57% reduction that triggered an onslaught of letters, phone calls and visits from grassroots backers of the Extension Service. Protests kept coming in even after Congress in October boosted the agency budget by $4 million from the fiscal 1986 level to $332 million.    Separately, budget and Transportation Department officials said the president's budget will propose an increase in the number of air-traffic control positions to 15,225. The controller work force currently is about 14,750 and is projected to rise to 15,000 by the end of fiscal 1987.    The budget also includes an increase of nearly 70%, to $1.35 billion, for the Federal Aviation Administration's decade-long modernization and capital improvement effort, known as the National Air Space Plan.    In another budget-related development, officials disclosed that the administration plans to propose legislation requiring an elaborate appropriations process for federal lending programs that currently benefit such borrowers as students, farmers and small businesses.    The legislation is aimed partly at spurring lawmakers to reduce loan and loan-guarantee programs. The administration also views the proposal as part of a campaign to make federal lending programs operate in a more businesslike fashion. The legislation, entitled the Credit Reform Act of 1987, will be announced with the pending budget, according to administration documents.    Under the proposed legislation, which faces a tough time in Congress, the government would use several methods to determine the subsidies implicit in different credit programs. For a loan slated for sale to private investors -- such as a rural housing or small business loan -- the subsidy would equal the difference between the face value of the loan and the price of the sale.    For other loans, such as a foreign military-sales loan that is too politically sensitive to sell to private investors, the subsidy would be determined by comparing the interest rate and other loan terms to rates and terms available in the private sector. For a loan guarantee, the subsidy would equal the cost of privately insuring the loan.    Federal agencies would be required to seek congressional appropriations for the subsidies. By forcing lawmakers to specifically appropriate the subsidy amounts, the legislation would &quot;at least let them know what they're doing&quot; in terms of the true costs of credit programs, a budget official said. &quot;And, they might reach the conclusion that they ought to reduce the level.&quot;    Currently, loan and loan-guarantee programs are subject to a variety of limits. Some loan programs require annual appropriations for the full loan amount, but others don't require any annual action because they are financed by revolving funds. Still others have limits on the amount that can be lent or guaranteed at any one time. Federal loans outstanding totaled $257 billion at the end of 1985, and guarantees outstanding totaled $410 billion.    ---   Also contributing to this article was Laurie McGinley. </TEXT></DOC>
