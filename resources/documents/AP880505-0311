(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A tentative two-year labor agreementcompleted in marathon negotiations between Chrysler Corp. and theUnited Auto Workers now faces the scrutiny of the union's nationalChrysler council and the rank and file.   Union and Chrysler negotiators finished two-and-a-half weeks ofbargaining _capped by nearly 40 hours of non-stop negotiations _Wednesday over a contract covering 66,000 hourly and salariedworkers in 15 states.   The pact, which largely mirrors the job-protecting contractsalready in force at Chrysler rivals Ford Motor Co. and GeneralMotors Corp., will go before the UAW's 140-member national Chryslercouncil on Friday before it can be put to a ratification vote nextweek.   Chrysler's chief negotiator, Vice President Anthony St. John,called the agreement ``equitable and affordable'' and said thesettlement cleared the way for improved labor relations aftermonths of bitter conflict.   Unlike the Ford and GM contracts, it also prevents Chryslerexecutives from receiving cash or stock bonuses in years whenworkers receive no profit-sharing.   The clause is important to Chrysler workers, who were angered atthe generosity of 1987 executive compensation that included $17.9million in earningsy by Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca.   ``We think it's a breakthrough. We think it's time in Americathat this disparity come to an end,'' said UAW Vice President MarcStepp, the union's chief negotiator.   The contract includes the same profit-sharing formula containedin the Ford and GM contracts and will produce its first payout inMarch 1989 out of 1988 profits.   Also unlike the Ford and GM pacts, the Chrysler contractincludes a $1,000 bonus for signing the pact, which replaces athree-year contract set to expire Sept. 14. Chrysler workersreceived a $2,120 signing bonus in 1985 for agreeing to athree-year contract.   The new contract, if ratified, would expire with the GM and Fordcontracts on Sept. 14, 1990, allowing the UAW to bargain with theBig Three simultaneously for the first time since 1979.   Under the pattern contract, workers will receive lump sumbonuses of 3 percent of wages in 1989 and 1990.   The contract prevents plant closings not already announced whennegotiations began and requires purchasers of any Chrysler plantsto accept the contract.   It forbids layoffs for any reasons except slow sales, halves therate of attrition and makes it more difficult for the company tomove work to outside companies or foreign countries. Chrysleragreed to spend up to $230 million on the Base Employment Levelsprogram, which will continue paying workers the automaker mustplace in a job bank if it eliminates their jobs for reasons otherthan production cuts.   UAW leaders agreed to encourage local unions to consideradopting Japanese-style work agreements that organize workers intoteams, increasing efficiency and product quality.   Chrysler agreed to UAW representation of salaried workers atthree new locations and the UAW agreed to allow Chryslerflexibility in using those workers.   Chrysler and the UAW began bargaining on April 18 in an effortto heal a series of wounds that inflicted beginning with Chrysler'sannouncement in January that it planned to close a 5,500-workerKenosha, Wis., assembly plant that had been scheduled to run fivemore years.   That was followed by plans to sell Chrysler's 28,000-workerAcustar Inc. parts subsidiary, which sparked company-wide protestsand plans for crippling plant-by-plant strikes.   In early March, Chrysler backed down from the sale and agreed toearly talks.   But negotiations were nearly derailed at the start by bydisclosure of Iacocca's 1987 earnings, the company's demand toseverely restrict when workers could retire with full benefits andconfirmation that Chrysler planned to move its K-car production toMexico in the summer.   Iacocca mended those blunders last week by announcing K-carproduction would stay in Detroit until year's end and that theKenosha plant would stay open until year's end.</TEXT></DOC>
