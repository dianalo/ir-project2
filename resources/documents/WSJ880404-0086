Taylor (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board's refusal to begin shrinking its special assessment on savings and loan associations drew industry complaints that thrifts are bearing an &quot;inequitable competitive burden.&quot;    The board voted Friday to prevent the planned shrinkage in the assessments, which are designed to help finance the rescue of the industry's growing list of insolvent members. At the same time, it said it plans to introduce variable assessments that would free the best-capitalized thrifts from paying the surcharge. The latter idea is aimed at preventing an exodus of healthy thrifts to insurance coverage by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which has no such surcharge.    Both moves drew an immediate blast from the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the largest thrift trade group. William O'Connell, president of the league, called the decision to keep the special assessments &quot;regrettable,&quot; and he charged that it &quot;flies in the face of the understanding between savings institutions and the administration&quot; last summer, when Congress authorized the assessments.    The board's action continues the special assessment rate at 1/32 of one percent of insured deposits for the first quarter of 1988. That is added to the 1/12 of one percent that is collected from both banks and thrifts as the standard fee for insuring deposits as large as $100,000.    The Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 called for the surcharge to start dropping last year, unless the bank board blocked the decline. But for two consecutive quarters now, growing losses of the thrift industry have spurred the board to prevent the assessments from going down.    Mr. O'Connell said the surcharge imposes an &quot;inequitable competitive burden&quot; on thrifts because banks don't have to pay it. Several savings and loans have been planning to escape the surcharge by shifting to insurance issued by the FDIC. That will be permitted after Aug. 10 unless Congress blocks it. Thrifts making the move would be charged an exit fee, but they could earn that back after only a few years of lower insurance costs.    Board member Lawrence White has talked of a variable assessment rate scheme for several weeks, but other members previously hadn't endorsed it. The board gave no details of how its system would work, saying that would be disclosed this week.    Mr. O'Connell asserted that the board lacks authority to impose variable assessments. A Bank Board spokesman said the board would review all criticisms of the proposal once it is published.    Danny Wall, chairman of the board, denied that the board would extend the full assessment continuously. He blamed extention of the full assessment through the first quarter on the expected cost of subsidizing Texas thrift mergers. He also pointed to the board's problems selling its bonds.    Last week, the board placed $300 million in 30-year bonds, about half as much as in previous offerings. Yet it had to pay 104 basis points more than the 30-year Treasury-bond rate, 14 points more than its highest previous premium. Mr. Wall blamed the board's higher costs on a &quot;softening&quot; in the bond market, reflecting Japanese investors' year-end tax accounting. Wall Street observers blamed reports of growing thrift losses in the Southwest.    A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point. </TEXT></DOC>
