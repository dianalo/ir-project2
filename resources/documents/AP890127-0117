Mrs. Hills also vowed that she and her attorney husband wouldeach take measures to make certain that she would never be facedwith a conflict of interest in her new role as the nation's toptrade negotiator. She said she would divest herself of any businessties that could raise such a problem.   Mrs. Hills stressed that she would ``not hesitate to act whennecessary and appropriate to fight unfair trade practices of foreigngovernments.''   ``Retaliation cannot be the goal of our policy,'' she said. ``Infact, it signals the failure of our efforts to open foreign markets.But the credible threat of retaliation provides essential leveragein our market-opening efforts. Thus, actual retaliation will beused, albeit reluctantly, to preserve the credibility of of thisthreat.''   At another point, Mrs. Hills said she would prefer to settletrade dispute with a handshake and a deal. But she said that whennegotiations fail to do the job she will not hesitate to retaliateand open markets ``with a crowbar if necessary.''   Mrs. Hills, a Californian, served in the Ford administration assecretary of housing and urban development. She has been practicinglaw in Washington since then. When she was named to the traderepresentative's post, Bentsen issued a statement saying he hadhoped for someone with more experience in problems of global markets.   Before the committee, however, Mrs. Hills impressed senators withher detailed knowledge of complex issues ranging from plywood tradebetween the United States and Canada to American complaints aboutEuropean government subsidies for the jetliner manufacturer AirbusIndustrie.   ``I think you are going to be a terrific trade representative,''Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., told her.   She also made a point of living up to her advance billing bysupporters as a tough negotiator.   ``Make no mistake,'' declared Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., ``thisis a gentle lady, but this lady has the guts of a lion.''   ``We have to have our agreements enforced,'' Mrs. Hillstestified. ``And where our partners are violating our agreements wemust take action.''   ``Were I to say one thing to the Japanese today, it is: we musthave results,'' she said at another point.</TEXT></DOC>
