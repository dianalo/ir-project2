The NTG Neue Technologien firm of Gelnhausen has been underinvestigation for suspected illegal exports since last year, andinvestigators plan to ask for help from the U.S. Justice Department,according to Nuclear Fuel, a biweekly magazine published byMcGraw-Hill Inc.   The article prepared by the magazine's Bonn office was to appearin Monday's edition, but it was released in advance to news agenciesin Bonn on Sunday.   The investigative arm of the U.S. Congress, the GeneralAccounting Office, earlier this month released a report sayingforeign countries are gaining access to U.S. government technologythat could help them develop atomic weapons. It blamed the problemon conflicting laws and erratic enforcement.   The report singled out Pakistan, which is suspected of workingsecretly to develop nuclear weapons, and India, which detonated anuclear device in 1974.   The magazine, quoting unidentified sources involved in theinvestigation, said NTG ``systematically sought, and in some casesobtained, technology from U.S. companies for nuclear-relatedprograms in Pakistan and India over the past few years.'' It saidthe exports were illegal.   It said NTG officials had refused to respond to its report.   The Associated Press called NTG's office in Gelnhausen, about 20miles east of Frankfurt, but a recorded message said it was closeduntil Monday.   There was also no answer Sunday at the federal prosecutor'soffice in Hanau, where the inquiry is being directed.   West German companies have repeatedly been accused over the pastfew years of engaging in sensitive or illegal trade.   The Imhausen-Chemie firm of Lahr has been under investigationthis year on suspicion of outfitting a Libyan plant that Washingtonsays can be used for making poison gas. The case strained U.S.-WestGerman relations earlier this year.   In January, the Bonn government accused five other West Germancompanies of helping Iraq develop chemical weapons.   In its report, Nuclear Fuel said NTG, which has a representativein Princeton, N.J., bought two high-powered lasers in the UnitedStates and obtained export permission by saying they were for use inWest Germany.   The lasers were intended for use in the production of nuclearfuel, the magazine said.   The U.S. firm that sold NTG the lasers, Coherent General ofSturbridge, Mass., obtained an export permit for the sale oncondition that NTG would use them itself and that the lasers wouldremain in West Germany, the magazine said.   Shipment of such technology to the subcontinent would be outlawedunder U.S. Commerce Department regulations, the magazine said. Itwould also violate the international Nuclear Non-ProliferationTreaty.   The magazine said Peter Finke, director of the PTB consultingfirm affiliated with NTG, told investigators he was repeatedlypressured by Pakistani agents ``to acquire an entire range ofnuclear technology, including technology to produce a thermonuclearweapon.''   Nuclear Fuel said the laser systems were shipped by NTG toFrankfurt in December 1986 and re-exported to Margalla Enterprisesin Karachi, Pakistan, two weeks later. Margalla is a purchasingagent for the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, Nuclear Fuel said.   The West German government office responsible for exports toldNuclear Fuel that NTG apparently shipped the lasers to Pakistanwithout seeking a West German export permit.   Nuclear Fuel said it had examined financial records in WestGermany that showed the Pakistani purchaser paid NTG $425,000,nearly three times the U.S. sale price of the laser systems.   The magazine said NTG was also under investigation on suspicionof shipping U.S. components for a reactor refueling machine toBombay, India, in 1987.   Those parts were obtained by NTG from the Imperial Clevite Corp.,of Cleveland, Nuclear Fuel said. The magazine said Clevite officialsbelieved the parts were being procured for a Canadian firm.</TEXT></DOC>
