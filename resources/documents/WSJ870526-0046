While ticklish military and political problems remain, especially in West Germany, it is now much more likely than it was just a week ago that Europe won't object to a U.S.-Soviet agreement to remove all, or nearly all, nuclear weapons on both sides that have ranges of more than 300 miles.    The new-found areas of agreement could smooth discussions of this issue at the seven-nation economic summit in Venice, Italy, beginning June 8 and at a key North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting in Iceland just after that. They also could open the way for a U.S.-Soviet missile agreement by the fall, before the U.S. presidential election campaign is in full swing.    &quot;The zero option&quot; -- the elimination from Europe of Soviet and U.S. missiles that have ranges of more than 600 miles -- &quot;is set; the double-zero is almost set,&quot; said a French official on Friday, following a Paris meeting between West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand and French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac. The &quot;double-zero&quot; proposal also would eliminate both sides' missiles that have ranges of between 300 miles and 600 miles.    Although Western European governments are closer to a consensus than ever before, the position they appear to be edging toward may not please the Soviet Union. The West Germans, backed by the French, are expected to ask for the retention and modernization of the 72 Pershing 1A missiles based in West Germany. Those missiles have U.S.-controlled nuclear warheads and have a range of 300 miles to 600 miles.    It is thought that the Soviets likely won't let NATO countries keep this many missiles without a counter-balance on the Soviet side. What's more, NATO officials in Brussels, Belgium, noted that the Soviets' latest negotiating position is that they aren't willing to accept anything but the total elimination of missiles in the above-300 mile category.    &quot;The 72 German Pershings may be more of a sticking point than people think,&quot; said one top NATO aide. Whether a possible compromise -- allowing the Soviets to retain a like number of forward-based missiles -- could be worked out remains to be seen, the official said.    Mr. Mitterrand, France's Socialist president, is playing an important role in determining Europe's position. He has quietly, but firmly, decided to support the double-zero option despite &quot;reservations&quot; expressed by the more-conservative Mr. Chirac. According to French officials, when Mr. Kohl arrived last Thursday for his talks, it quickly became clear that the official French position, like that taken by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the week before, would be to support the U.S. negotiating stance.    Mrs. Thatcher's backing of the double-zero option, amid the British election campaign, had already increased pressure on Mr. Kohl. &quot;Thatcher kicked Kohl in the pants for her own electoral reasons,&quot; said a high-ranking French official. The pressure grew even more when German voters seemed to endorse the Free Democratic Party, which favors the double-zero plan, in local elections last week.    Mr. Kohl said in Paris that he will outline Germany's position in a speech to the West German parliament on June 4. But both French and German officials said he had agreed, although with strong reservations, to agree to the general outlines of the double-zero proposal.    The Germans also are expected to push for simultaneous, but not necessarily linked, talks between the U.S. and the Soviets on the elimination of battlefield and other nuclear weapons based in Europe that have ranges of less than 300 miles, as well as talks on the conventional and chemical arms imbalance that currently favors Warsaw Pact nations.    Toward that goal, the Germans have an understanding ally in France. &quot;The German problem is obvious and compelling,&quot; said a high-ranking French Foreign Ministry official. &quot;If there are only weapons of very short range, then German is the sole, isolated target, the only potential battleground. All the pressure is on them. They don't want that, and neither do we.&quot;    Among other concerns, the official said, would be growing pressure on the West Germans to strike some sort of reunification pact with East Germany in return for total West German disarmament or leaving NATO. &quot;Then it's not just Germany's problem,&quot; the French official said. </TEXT></DOC>
