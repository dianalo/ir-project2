Felix Rodriguez, a close friend of Mr. Bush's nationalsecurity adviser, worked from a post in El Salvador, obtainedwith the blessing of the vice president, where he assistedthe Salvadoran military in helicopter operations aimed atquelling leftist insurgents in that country.</LP><TEXT>   The president and his former national security adviser,Donald Gregg, have repeatedly denied knowing anything then ofMr. Rodriguez's activities on behalf of the NicaraguanContras. Yet in a deposition released last week, the formerhead of the CIA's Latin American division told senators of aMay 1986 meeting in Central America where he was informed ofMr. Rodriguez's connections to so-called &quot;privatebenefactors&quot; supplying the Contras.   Mr. Bush's office has said that he spoke twice with Mr.Rodriguez that same month but that there was no mention ofsupport operations for the Contras. By comparison, the CIALatin American chief said that one of his officers in CentralAmerica said Mr. Rodriguez was so close to the support effortthat the officer would avoid any contact given restrictionsthen on the agency's involvement.   Later that summer, as the CIA prepared to resumeauthorized military aid to the insurgents, the chief of theCentral American task force, Alan Fiers, also worried aboutMr. Rodriguez's performance. In an Aug. 6, 1986, telephoneconversation apparently recorded at the CIA, Mr. Fiers spokeof the need to have Mr. Bush's office &quot;get Rodriguez out ofthe Contra supply activity&quot; according to Senate IntelligenceCommittee Chairman David Boren (D., Okla.). Mr. Fiers, who iscooperating now with independent counsel Lawrence Walsh'sinvestigation of the Iran-Contra scandal, said last week thathe, in fact, went through former White House aide Marine Lt.Col. Oliver North rather than Mr. Bush's national securityadviser, Mr. Gregg. But Mr. Walsh's grand-jury inquiry isbelieved to include Mr. Gregg, now U.S. ambassador to SouthKorea. And the prosecutor has given immunity to SamuelWatson, a second Bush deputy who worked with Mr. Gregg,according to people familiar with the investigation.   The disclosures don't change the administration'sconfidence that Mr. Gates will prevail in the IntelligenceCommittee, which continues its questioning of the nominee inclosed door and open sessions this week. But the hearingrecord is significant nonetheless for the new details itprovides regarding not only the 47-year-old analyst but thepresident who chose him.   Apart from Iran-Contra, the events touched on in themid-1980s run from Iraq to the Vatican, and Mr. Bushparticipated as both vice president then and a futureRepublican presidential nominee. His office gave him animportant role in national security and anti-terrorism policyeven as he was anxious politically to quell conservativedoubts of his credentials as Ronald Reagan's would-besuccessor.   The questioning sheds light on how closely U.S.intelligence worked then with Iraqi President Saddam Husseinin his war with Iran. Begun in the early 1980s, the operationescalated in 1986. At issue is whether the action went beyondintelligence sharing and became a covert effort to persuadethe Iraqi military to attack specific economic targets insideIran.   Line drawings, made from satellite photos, were shareddirectly with Baghdad, and Saudi Arabia, which at this pointwas both secretly funding the Contras and also participatingin such joint covert programs with the U.S. as the Afghanwar, urged Washington to assist Iraq.   U.S. efforts increased after a series of successfulIranian offensives, including the capture of the FaoPeninsula in early 1986. And in subsequent months, Iraqcarried out a series of long-range bombing attacks on Iranianoil facilities at Larak and Sirri Islands that cut Tehran'sexports by more than half by the end of the year. The Senatecommittee is seeking more information from the CIA as to thefull range of its involvement, and a central issue is whetherthe administration stretched the meaning of what isacceptable under so-called &quot;liaison relations&quot; withintelligence services.   Without commenting directly on the secret Iraqi operation,Bobby Ray Inman, a former CIA deputy director who servedunder the late William Casey, testified last week that acritical test is whether intelligence is used as leverage topersuade another country to take action it otherwise wouldn'ttake. &quot;If you're trying to get them to go act, it needs afinding,&quot; or a notice to Congress, said Mr. Inman in anexchange with Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.).   Mr. Bush comes up again in the Gates hearings on the issueof whether the nominee slanted intelligence reports to suitthe ideology of his superiors. Among the documents underreview is a 1985 assessment of the alleged Soviet role in theassassination attempt on Pope John Paul II four years before-- a heated subject not only for anti-communists but also forCatholic voters courted by Republicans.   Mr. Gates was then the CIA's deputy director forintelligence, and Democrats have questioned whether hedistorted the meaning of the analysis by failing to explainfully the underlying assumptions in a cover lettercirculating the study to others in the government. Thedocuments remain classified, but among those receiving thepaper was Mr. Bush, who warmly praised the product and Mr.Gates, according to people familiar with the case.</TEXT></DOC>
