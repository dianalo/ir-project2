The study is based upon datafrom ten utilities offering I/C service and 150 customers that receiveI/C service. The paper deals with two major customer response issues:methods for measuring the load impacts of I/C rates and the degree ofcustomer compliance. Both issues are examined using data for customerson I/C rates. The evidence suggests ways to design I/C service to achievedemand-side management objectives. 3 refs., 2 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
