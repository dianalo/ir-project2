The characteristics of various sitesin the Bay are examined and possible plant configurations and operatingschemes are detailed. Construction and design concepts are discussedand the component parts including generating equipment, are analyzed.Of the tidal power sites which would be capable of producing significantamounts of energy, those at the mouth of Cumberland Basin, Cobequid Bayand Shepody Bay would provide the best prospects for development. Theconstruction of a tidal power plant at any of these sites would be technicallyfeasibile. Under the economic conditions expected to prevail up to andbeyond 2000 single basin schemes operated for maximum energy output wouldoffer the lowest unit costs of energy, and would eliminate some fossil-fuelledgeneration from the Maritime utilities expansion programs. Economic assessmenthas conclusively demonstrated the fundamental economic feasibility oftidal power and the technical and economic feasibility of its integrationinto the project generation supply systems of the Maritime Provinces.Because of the large minimum investment, financial feasibility of a tidalpower plant would be conditional upon substantial direct participationby governments. The Cumberland Basin site was found to be the preferredcandidate project for initial development for many reasons includingthose deriving from the fact that the project is the smallest of thethree projects considered potentially viable. 153 figs., 87 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
