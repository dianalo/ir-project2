The elderly housewife is one of thousands of Asian-Americanswhose years in America have failed to dampen their love for HongKong-style dramas.   ``I have to watch several tapes (of Cantonese soaps) every night.Otherwise I can't sleep,'' said Leung, who has moved to amiddle-class neighborhhood outside of Chinatown since immigrating 20years ago from Hong Kong.   Chinatown waiter Hui Ming Kee likes to spend the days of his lifewatching videotapes of such popular soaps as ``Man in a Net'' and``Family Feud'' (no relation to the American television program),both based loosely on ``Dallas.''   In one sitting at home, he said he watched seven three-hour tapeswithout interruption. Hui said the tapes are his major form ofentertainment.   Asian-Americans lease 900 tapes in an average week at oneChinatown rental shop, the manager said.   ``They (customers) nearly emptied out our inventory of the morepopular tapes just before Thanksgiving weekend,'' said Lily Yee,supervisor of the Hong Kong TV Video.   The locations are strictly Hong Kong in most tapes and the soapsoften reflect such Confucian ideals as loyalty to the family,respect for one's parents and dedication to work.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ushers at Carnegie Hall move from the back of theauditorium to center stage tonight when they present a free artexhibition and concert of Brahms, Chopin, Puccini and Bartok.   ``It's a great opportunity to show the other ushers _ andeveryone _ just what we can do,'' said five-year usher BrianMatthews, who organized the event at Carnegie's Weill Recital Hall.
