Energy prices soared 7.2 percent, propelled by the steepestone-month increase in gasoline prices in nearly 2{ years. Thoserises were largely offset, however, by a broad fall in food prices,the first real breather since last year's drought, and by asubstantial decline in auto costs.   The news rallied stock and bond markets, where traders said thereport indicated the Federal Reserve Board's yearlong campaign offighting inflation with higher interest rates is working. The DowJones average of 30 industrials surged 56.82 points to close at apost-crash high of 2,439.70.   ``This is an excellent report,'' said economist Bruce Steinbergof Merrill Lynch. ``I think it would be premature to declarevictory over inflation, but the report does suggest we won't seeany more acceleration and that the Fed is unlikely to tightenmore.''   But the Business Council, a group of 65 chief executives fromthe nation's largest corporations, said Friday they foresee littledeceleration either.   ``The central view is that although the flare-up in prices earlyin 1989 was an aberration, price behavior will not improveappreciably until mid-1990,'' the executives said in a reportreleased at their semi-annual retreat in Hot Springs, Va., a poshresort town.   The April advance in the Labor Department's Producer Price Indexfor finished goods, one stop short of retail, followed an identical0.4 percent gain in March and 1 percent jumps in January andFebruary.   Because of the steep rises early in the year, wholesale pricesincreased at a 9 percent annual rate in the first four months of1989. That's more than double last year's wholesale inflation of 4percent and four times the 2.2 percent rate in 1987.   However, economists said much _ but not all _ of theacceleration this year is attributable to a one-time shock from arise of more than 30 percent in the price of crude oil since theend of 1988.   ``We'll see an increase in (energy) prices next month, but notof this magnitude,'' said economist Donald Ratajczak of GeorgiaState University. ``Our feeling is they will fall off in the secondhalf of the year.''   The huge 7.2 percent rise in energy costs last month was almostentirely attributable to a 13.4 percent climb in gasoline prices,the steepest since January 1987. Fuel oil prices rose acomparatively moderate 0.6 percent after zooming ahead 16.8 percentin March. Natural gas prices advanced 1.9 percent.   A 0.6 percent decline in food costs, led by a 15.9 percent dropfor eggs, was the biggest since December 1987. Vegetables fell 7.5percent; pork, 3.6 percent; fruit, 2.7 percent; and fish, 1.3percent. The prices of turkeys, rice and candy rose.   ``We've pretty much topped out on the drought,'' Ratajczak said.``Barring another drought, we're going to get more up-and-downrather than steady up.''   Economists were particularly encouraged by the April inflationrate for goods outside of the volatile food and energy categories.Those prices overall edged down 0.1 percent, the first drop sinceOctober 1987, following a 0.3 percent rise in March.   The biggest drop came in autos, where prices fell 2.8 percent,the result of manufacturers' incentives to lure customers intoshowrooms and revive slumping sales.   There were also declines in children's clothing, cosmetics,magazines and tires. Prices rose for jewelry and electronicequipment.   The overall April increase left the Producer Price Index forfinished goods at 113.0, meaning that a hypothetical selection ofgoods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $113 last month, up from$112.20 in March.   Measures of inflation earlier in the production process alsoshowed moderation. Intermediate goods rose 0.4 percent in Aprilfollowing a 0.7 percent jump in March. Crude goods rose 0.6 percentfollowing a 2.3 percent gain.   An example of the three processing levels would be wholesalebread at the finished level, flour at the intermediate and wheat atthe crude.   Economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicagosaid Friday's producer price figures reinforce analysts'expectations that Federal Reserve policymakers will vote to holdinterest rates steady when they meet in private next Tuesday to setmonetary policy through June.   ``One thing you can be sure of,'' he said. ``For the first timein a long time, they're not going to be asking themselves whetherthey should be tightening. I think the basic thing the Fed will dois say, `All right, we seem to be making progress.''   In a separate report Friday, the Commerce Department saidbusiness inventories in March rose 0.3 percent while sales wereflat, confirming earlier government statistics showing economicgrowth slowing.</TEXT></DOC>
