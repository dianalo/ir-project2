WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis, on the verge of claiming themajority he needs to wrap up the Democratic presidential nomination,said today he and Jesse Jackson ``talked in general terms'' about afuture role for Jackson.   As voters went to the polls in California and three other finalprimary states, Dukakis talked positively about the primary seasonand the months to come.   He said he discussed a role for Jackson in a Dukakisadministration when the two met late last night and early thismorning.   ``We talked in general terms about that,'' Dukakis said.   Dukakis said they did not discuss the vice presidential spot.   ``Tomorrow's another day and I'll be thinking about running matesproviding today is a good day,'' he told reporters.   The Massachusetts governor was also poised to finally gain theendorsement of banished rivals Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri andSen. Paul Simon of Illinois on Wednesday.   His wife, Kitty, said she was confident the final primaries wouldput her husband over the top in his march toward the 2,081 delegatesneeded to clinch the nomination.   ``I think Michael will do well and I'm hoping by the eighth ofJune that he will have sewn up the convention,'' Mrs. Dukakis saidin a telephone interview from her hospital bed in Boston.   Going into today's final round, Dukakis held 1,900 of the 2,081delegates needed to win the nomination.   Dukakis, campaigning at a high school in the San Fernando Valleyaround Los Angeles, said he hoped to clinch that magic number ofdelegates tonight. The campaign was clearly confident he wouldsecure what was needed from the more than 450 delegates up for grabson Tuesday, most of them in California and the remainder in NewJersey, New Mexico and Montana.   The Dukakis campaign would like to declare it has gone over thetop in the delegate race tonight or Wednesday morning, before thecandidate flies back to Massachusetts.   Dukakis' wife Kitty, who is recuperating from spinal surgery at aBoston hospital, said she planned to watch the California returnsfrom her hospital bed. ``I'm excited about tomorrow,'' she said.   Spokesman Martin Bander of Massachusetts General Hospital saidMrs. Dukakis could be discharged within a week.   A Dukakis campaign official, speaking on condition of anonymity,said Dukakis would stop in Missouri on his way home Wednesday andpick up an endorsement from former rival Rep. Richard Gephardt. Theofficial also said Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, who has suspended hisDemocratic campaign, would endorse Dukakis in Washington onWednesday.   Throughout his last day of primary campaigning, Dukakis lookedback on his long quest for his party's nomination _ one that beganpublicly with a trip in early February 1987 to Osceola, Iowa, asmall town in the state where the first caucuses were held a yearlater.   ``It's by no means the end tomorrow,'' he told a lunchtime crowdat a San Diego plaza. ``It's the beginning, the beginning of aDemocratic victory in the fall.''   Dukakis jabbed briefly at his likely Republican opponent for thefall, George Bush, over the issue of drilling for oil off theCalifornia coast, and spoke of Democratic unity when asked aboutJackson.   ``If the tables were reversed, and he was on his way to thenomination and I was the runner up, I'd expect to be deeply involved... I'd try to bring my people into this. I'd be as much service tothe ticket as I possibly could,'' Dukakis said.   ``I'm confident he will be that kind of person,'' he added.   ``We'll be reaching out to supporters of Jesse, and the otherDemocratic candidates, as we have already,'' Dukakis said. ``Theresponse has been terrific. I'm really overwhelmed by the goodfeeling, the spirit, the confidence. A sense of victory is in theair.''   Dukakis aides sought to minimize the impact of Jackson's remarksthe same day, in which he suggested he would go to the DemocraticNational Convention floor to fight over the platform on South Africaif Dukakis did not alter his position to meet Jackson's. Jackson haspressed Dukakis to say he was willing to brand South Africa aterrorist state.   Dukakis issues director Jim Steinberg said, ``There is a broadbasis for agreement here.   ``Gov. Dukakis and Rev. Jackson share the same fundamentalcommitment on issues relating to South Africa,'' Steinberg said.``They both want to see an end to apartheid and to take strong andeffective steps both by the United States and by the internationalcommunity.''</TEXT></DOC>
