They remained skeptical, however, that any concrete results will come from the latest political moves. They expressed pessimism about the dollar's outlook as long as the wide budget and trade deficits remain.    &quot;We've seen an uptick in the dollar, but I think it's short-lived,&quot; Robert K. Ryan, vice president, foreign exchange, at Irving Trust Co., New York, said. &quot;If nothing is done to restore (investor) confidence, the dollar could head lower sooner rather than later.&quot;    The dollar also is being supported by fears that major central banks would intervene to support it in case of a market sell-off. Traders said they believe the major industrial nations are committed to enforcing exchange-rate stability at least until calm returns to the world's stock markets.    &quot;They cannot have a double hit&quot; to both stock markets and the dollar, Axel Coym, vice president and chief trader at Westpac Banking Corp., New York, said. &quot;To take fear and panic out of the stock market, the dollar had to stabilize.&quot;    But recent developments may have limited the choices available to the U.S. and its major allies for propping up the dollar, some traders said.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8170 West German marks, compared with 1.8128 late Tuesday. The dollar also climbed to 144.63 Japanese yen from 144.36.    After its severe slump Monday, coinciding with the collapse of stock markets around the world, the dollar has been rising since finance officials from the U.S. and West Germany announced late that day that they had patched up their differences on monetary policy.    Specifically, the two nations agreed to tolerate a slightly lower exchange rate between the dollar and the West German mark, within the range believed to have been set by major industrial nations early this year. They also agreed that Bonn will adopt a somewhat more stimulative monetary policy, and the U.S. agreed to help defend the dollar at the proposed slightly lower level.    West Germany had tightened its credit policy earlier out of concern for inflation and to reign in its rapidly growing money supply. But Tuesday, it reduced short-term interest rates.    &quot;Officials were trying to talk the dollar up and remove uncertainty from the foreign exchange market. They've done a good job,&quot; Mr. Coym said.    The dollar also firmed on a White House statement that President Reagan is &quot;willing to listen to any proposal&quot; on reducing the budget deficit. Some market participants interpreted the statement by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater as indicating that the president may be considering a compromise involving a tax increase.    &quot;If he comes out with a compromise on a tax increase and Congress compromises on budget cuts, that would be very good for the financial markets,&quot; Cynthia H. Johnson, vice president and corporate foreign exchange manager in New York for Britain's Lloyds Bank PLC, said.    Many traders, skeptical about a swift resolution of the U.S. economic problems that have plagued the dollar for more than two years, are sticking to their predictions that the dollar will set new lows for the year against other major currencies.    &quot;The bearish sentiment is still intact,&quot; Charles A. Spence, vice president, foreign exchange, at First Interstate Bank of California, Los Angeles, said.    When the dollar comes under pressure again, some traders say, the U.S. and its allies may be hard-pressed to do anything to stop its decline. The recent stock market plunges, especially those of Friday and Monday, probably limited the U.S. Federal Reserve's ability to raise interest rates to defend the dollar for fear of harming the economy and risking another stocks rout.    Meanwhile, the West German and Japanese central banks, which spent heavily in earlier market intervention to support the dollar, may be unwilling to do so again because of their own money supply-growth problems.    &quot;The central banks have tied up each other's hands and don't have much to defend the dollar anymore except for their chatter,&quot; a trader at a New York bank with close central bank ties said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $4.90 an ounce to $468.10 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was four million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $468.75 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Wednesday, Oct. 21, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
