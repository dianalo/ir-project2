Miller (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CEE AGS </CO><IN> TNM EDP </IN><TEXT>   In the latest sign of consolidation in the computer software and services industry, AGS Computers Inc. said it agreed to buy C3 Inc. for $15.75 a share, or about $155 million.    The price marked a 34% premium over C3's closing price Tuesday, but Wall Street still liked the plan for both companies. In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, C3's shares jumped $2.75 to $14.50, while AGS rose 25 cents to close at $17.25 a share.    In 1987, AGS's core business, making software and assembling computer systems, earned $14.2 million, or $1.19 a share, on sales of $496.7 million.    Herndon, Va.-based C3 designs computer systems for the federal government. In the nine months ended Dec. 31, it posted net income of $12.7 million, or $1.27 a share, on revenue of $84 million.    Lawrence Schoenberg, chief executive officer of AGS, said the Mountainside, N.J.-based company would run C3 as a separate subsidiary, with its current management. The plan still requires a final agreement and approval by C3 shareholders and government agencies, the companies said.    Computer software and services companies have been combining at a brisk pace in recent years as the industries mature and grow more competitive. </TEXT></DOC>
