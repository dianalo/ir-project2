Analysts wereskeptical the pact would last.   OPEC ministers predicted oil prices would jump to $18 a barrel ifthe accord is signed. Prices have been at least $4 lower in recentmonths.   Analysts said they did not believe OPEC members could restrainproduction for more than a few months, if at all.   A rise to $18 a barrel theoretically could add up to 10 cents tothe price of a gallon of gasoline, but analysts said they doubtedthat would happen because retail prices did not fall during therecent slump in crude prices.   The tentative deal worked out by the ministers of the 13-nationOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to limit theirproduction next year was announced late Thursday.   Iran's oil minister, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, flew to Tehran todayto get his government's approval for the pact, which sets a ceilingon OPEC's production at 18.5 million barrels a day in the first halfof 1989.   Analysts estimate OPEC has been producing more than 21 millionbarrels a day recently, far above the cartel's current cap of about15 million barrels.   Issam Abdul Raheem Chalabi, the Iraqi minister, also expressedconfidence the agreement would push crude prices back to OPEC'sbenchmark of $18 a barrel. Prices have been at least $4 lower inrecent months. ``I think we can reach that ($18 price) within a fewmonths,'' Chalabi said.   But analysts remained skeptical that an accord would lead to $18oil in the near future.   ``If they have an agreement, the market will take it as a gooddeal and prices will go up,'' said Cyrus Tahmassebi, an economistfor Ashland Oil Inc. ``But once the realities of the market hit,prices will come down again, and sharply.''   Tahmassebi said among the realities are that the market needsonly about 17 million barrels a day of oil from OPEC, well below the18.5 million cap the cartel proposed.   In London, futures prices rose between $1.55 and $1.65 a barrelfor Brent crude, the benchmark grade for North Sea oil. Analystssaid they did not expect prices to go much higher before coming downagain in the weeks ahead.   Oil trading in the United States was closed for the Thanksgivingholiday.   Analysts say each $1 rise in the price of a barrel of oiltheoretically adds 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices.   The ministers opened their winter meeting Monday but postponedfurther discussions until Saturday to give them time to end thestalemate between Iran and Iraq, which agreed to a cease-fire inAugust in their eight-year war.   The ministers want the production agreement to dry up some of theglut on the market so prices will go up.   The major stumbling block to the accord, which would replace onedrawn up in 1986, has been the Iran-Iraq dispute.   Iraq has been insisting that its production quota, or ceiling, inany new pact be the same as Iran's. Aghazadeh repeatedly said no.   It was not known exactly how that dispute was resolved.   Aghazadeh said Iran would retain its share of total cartel outputat 14.27 percent. ``I received a new proposal in which my mainconcern, which is to preserve my percentage share, is taken intoconsideration,'' he said.   With a ceiling of 18.5 million barrels, this would give Iran aquota of 2.64 million barrels a day. Its current cap is 2.4 millionbarrels.   ``As for the Iraqi quota, 11 members have agreed to donate partof their share to that country,'' Aghazadeh said. ``Insofar as thisparticular issue is concerned, I find it necessary to consult withmy government.   ``But other issues, I have agreed to,'' he said.   Aghazadeh did not say how large Iraq's quota would be under theplan. Its ceiling was set at 1.5 million barrels under the currentpact, although it has refused to honor that level.   Asked if he was still refusing to allow Iraq the same quota asIran, he replied, ``This is exactly the issue which I have toconsult with my government.''   ``If Tehran agrees that other countries could donate part oftheir share to Iraq, we will be able to have a strong agreement,''he said.   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emiratesand Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
