If United's 7,680 pilots approve it, the pact will moveUnited one step closer to solving pesky labor problems leftunsettled during years of buy-out proposals. United, a unitof UAL Corp., is still in talks with its flight attendantsand machinists. Both have been operating under expiredcontracts since November 1987 and November 1989,respectively.</LP><TEXT>   Although some issues remain unresolved with the pilots,&quot;the major issues have been solved,&quot; according to a spokesmanfor the Air Line Pilots Association.   Neither side would give details of the pact, which mustclear the union's executive council before going to thepilots. The pilots have been working under the terms of anexpired contract since April 1988.   The contract remained open for the past three years,initially because management requested work-rule and wageconcessions. But during much of that time, failed attempts bythe unions to purchase the carrier have left the talks onhold.   The two sides resumed talks in December and, according toone participant, they proceeded without confrontation. But inrecent weeks, pilots apparently grew impatient with the paceof the talks. According to reports, some United pilots haveslowed planes while taxiing on runways, a sign of anunofficial protest.   In an industry grappling with massive losses, layoffs, andliquidations, labor may have seen its bargaining strengthweakened in recent months. Industry analysts, who regularlypoint to United's stalled labor talks as the chief potentialrisk for investors, say the industry's current weakness mayhave enabled United to clear a major hurdle.   &quot;The pendulum really swung to the airline management'sfavor with all of the recent turmoil,&quot; said Kevin Murphy, ananalyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. &quot;This has been the kind ofshock treatment that labor negotiations needed.&quot;   Indeed, just two months ago AMR Corp.'s American Airlinesreached a tentative agreement with its 8,800 pilots, endingmore than a year of tough negotiations centered on wages.   But just how much influence United's tentative pact mighthave on continuing talks with its other unions remainsunclear. Ellon Jarvis, chief negotiator for the Associationof Flight Attendants, said she sees &quot;no reason to jump toconclusions,&quot; about how soon United's 15,000 flightattendants might get a new contract. &quot;I have become immune toleaps of emotion.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
