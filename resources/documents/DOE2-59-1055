The filesare processed to provide multigroup cross sections. The accuracy of thecore calculations depends on the initial data which are sometimes notaccurate enough. Therefore the reactor physicists carry out integralexperiments. We show in this paper, how the use of these integral experimentsand the application of the tendency research method can improve the accuracyof the neutron data. This technique was applied to the validation ofthe Apollo code library. For this purpose 60 buckling measurements (34for uranium fuel multiplying media and 26 for plutonium fuel multiplyingmedia) and 42 spent fuel analysis were used. Small modifications of theinitial data are proposed. The final values are compared which recentrecommended values of microscopic data and the agreement is good.</TEXT></DOC>
