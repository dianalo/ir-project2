This season also marks the first real test of interest-sensitiveadjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs as they're called, in an era oftightening credit. A government report issued earlier this weekshowed a 5.4 percent drop in housing starts last month, evidencethat rising rates are already having a major impact on the economy.Loan delinquencies could follow.   ``We haven't seen this before,'' said Robert Van Order, chiefeconomist for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Co., or Freddie Mac.``ARMs became popular in the early 1980s at the national levelafter rates started to come down.
