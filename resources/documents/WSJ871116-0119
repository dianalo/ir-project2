With consumer spending accounting for two-thirds of U.S. gross national product, some economists and business leaders fear that the stock market's collapse will prompt consumers to curtail spending, causing a recession.    But while the short-term economic outlook is uncertain, the long-term demographic outlook is more promising. Several household trends suggest that any spending slowdown may be short-lived.    The main factor that may bolster consumer purchases is the growth in certain types of households. (A &quot;household,&quot; according to the Census Bureau, comprises all people who occupy &quot;separate living quarters&quot; such as a house or an apartment, but not, for example, a college dormitory. Thus, in addition to traditional families, one person living in an apartment is considered a &quot;household,&quot; as are two people living together but not married.)    The U.S. now has 90 million households, and the number is growing about 1 1/2 times faster than the national population. This is a slower rate of growth than in the 1970s, when households grew twice as fast as the population. Back then, however, the growth was mostly among single people, single parents or young families. Now household growth is concentrated among married couples and middle-age groups.    Although the number of married couples has grown only 5% since 1980, they accounted for more than half of the new households formed in the past year. The benefit for the economy: Married couples annually spend about two-thirds more than other types of households.    Higher growth among married couples is expected to continue as members of the large, and generally single, young-adult population grow older and get married.    Getting Older...   A jump in the number of middle-age households is also expected to help strengthen consumer spending.    More than half of the increase in households since 1980 (54%) has occurred in families where the head of the household is age 35 to 44. That age group has grown 34% since 1980, and that rate of growth is expected to continue well into the 1990s.    While they account for only about onefifth of all households, members of the 35-to-44 age group account for more than one-quarter of all consumer spending, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey. Among such households, a big portion of their earnings is spent on basic items: food, clothing and housing.    This group's income and expenditures will probably continue to grow as it moves into the peak earning and spending years of 45 to 54. Households in that age group are projected by the Census Bureau to increase 38% during the next 10 years.    Householders age 35 to 44 also have the most children under age 18, which translates into additional expenditures. And new census data indicate that women in that age group are now having more children.    Delayed Maternity   Many baby-boomers are opting for mature motherhood.    The U.S. birth rate rose 2% between 1984 and 1985, but it was up 5% for women age 35 to 39, the largest increase of any age group, according to the Census Bureau.    Women in their 30s now account for one birth in four -- a higher fraction than at any time since 1964. Their birth rates are the highest they have been since the early 1970s. Additionally, more of their children are first-borns than at any time in the past, as more women are childless when they reach their 30s. First-born children generally cause a flurry of buying activity -- all the more so when they come later in life.    According to the Consumer Expenditure Survey, married couples with children under age six spend substantially above-average amounts for a wide array of products and services, including insurance, entertainment, autos, apparel, home furnishings and other household-related goods.    Overall, married couples with children spend an average of $6,500 a year more than married couples without children.    The stock-market crash of 1987 may result in an economic downturn. But increases in the number of married couples, middle-age households and older mothers will probably offset any decline in consumer spending. </TEXT></DOC>
