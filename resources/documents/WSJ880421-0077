Petrochemical earnings continued their climb, spurred by strong world-wide demand and the lower prices for oil -- the feedstock for petrochemicals. In addition, refining and marketing profits generally increased, especially for West Coast companies such as Atlantic Richfield Co. and Chevron Corp., analysts say.    Major oil companies are expected to begin reporting first-quarter results later this week or early next week. &quot;A number of companies will have record chemical earnings in the first quarter,&quot; predicts Bryan Jacoboski, an analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. in New York.    Exploration and production -- or upstream -- earnings compared less favorably. Crude prices in the first quarter averaged roughly $16 a barrel, or about $2 a barrel less than a year earlier.    The big profits could roll through the current quarter, too. &quot;I sense demand is higher world-wide and there's less talk about a world-wide recession than a year ago,&quot; Ted Eck, chief economist at Amoco Corp., says. &quot;The fundamentals are better.&quot;    Several other factors are bullish for oil prices and the industry. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries already has managed to talk up crude prices by calling a meeting for next Tuesday that will include non-OPEC members. Military action in the Persian Gulf has made the spot and futures markets gyrate and could continue to do so, and some industry officials speculate the flow of oil from the gulf will be curtailed.    Chemicals plus refining and marketing -- or downstream -- profits look strong now. Refining margins are approaching the enormous levels of mid-1986, when oil prices bottomed out. Gasoline inventories are relatively low, industry officials say, just as seasonal demand tends to pick up. In addition, the outlook for petrochemicals remains strong.    But that may not be enough. &quot;Even though crude prices have improved a lot lately, they have a long way to go to catch up with last year,&quot; says Bernard Picchi, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York. He notes that crude oil prices in the 1987 second quarter were in the range of $19 to $20 a barrel. While downstream earnings will continue to improve this quarter, the increases will slow, Mr. Picchi says. He predicts a flat quarter overall.    In the first quarter, refining margins were generally strong, particularly on the West Coast, where there are fewer competitors. Arco, based in Los Angeles, recently told securities analysts that its first-quarter net income probably exceeded $2 a share, compared with $1.31 a share a year earlier. Phillips Petroleum Co. also had an exceptionally strong quarter, saying it expects to report that net exceeded 51 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss.    Natural gas prices on the spot market surged in January and February, but the effect on profits is hard to assess, says PaineWebber's Mr. Jacoboski. It was certainly positive, but how much is questionable, because the major oil companies sell large amounts of their gas under contract, he says.    ---              Oil Companies' First-Quarter Profits                        Earnings per share                       ANALYSTS' MEAN        YEAR-EARLIER                            ESTIMATES              ACTUAL Amoco                          $1.46               $1.02 Exxon                           0.91                0.75 Mobil                           0.87                0.62 Occidental                      0.24                0.50 Sun                             0.64                0.35 Texaco                          0.59                0.49 Unocal                          0.43                0.52   Source: Institutional Brokers Estimate System</TEXT></DOC>
