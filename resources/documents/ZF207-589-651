 One of the most important issues related to this subject hasbeen the degrees of economies of scale (EOS) for computers.andP;  From earlystudies to recent ones, there is empirical evidence for large EOS incomputers.andP;  However, this opinion has recently been challenged.andM;One of the obvious characteristics of past studies is that most empiricalmodels are based on Grosch's statement: &quot;I believe that there is afundamental rule ...andP;  giving added economy only as the square root of theincrease in speed--that is, to do a calculation ten times as cheaply, youmust do it one hundred times as fast&quot;.andP;  Based on his remark, most studieshave developed models whereby computer cost is a function of computerperformance.andM;In this article, we examine problems with the models based on Grosch'sstatement, introduce alternative approaches, and estimate the developedmodels.andP;  The proposed models are based on production and cost functionapproaches of microeconomics.andP;  These two approaches allow us to fully utilizeall available information and to cross-check the validity of modelspecifications and estimation results.andM;As we will discuss, computer performance can be expressed as a function ofcomputer characteristics for the production function approach, whereascomputer cost can be expressed as a function of computer perforamance andcharacteristic prices for the cost function approach.andP;  Therefore, we need tohave price data on computer characteristics in order to estimate the costfunction.andP;  However, the prices of certain computer characteristics are notavailable since there are no explicit markets for these characteristics.andP;  Forexample, there is no explicit price for millions of instructions per second(MIPS) or input/output (I/O) channels.andM;In order to overcome the absence of price data for certain computercharacteristics, we develop a cost function expressed with computercharacteristics and performance under the assumptions of minimizing cost andmaximizing profit.andP;  For the price of a computer, we use both purchase andlease prices.andP;  The compatibility of results with the two different pricesprovides further support for the robustness of model specification andestimation results.andM;The equations developed are estimated for mainframes and superminicomputersavailable during the years 1981-1985.andP;  We have found that the results fromcost function approaches using purchase price and lease price, and from theproduction function approach are all compatible with each other.andP;  Theestimates of EOS range from 0.934 to 0.934 to 0.848 depending on the modelsused.andP;  Therefore, there is no evidence of scale economies for mainframes andsuperminicomputers.andP;  After controlling all factors such as higher MIPS,larger main memory size, and more I/O channels, computer purchase pricesdecrease about 23 percent and lease prices decrease about 15 percent eachyear.andP;  For comparable models, buying a computer costs 8 percent less andleasing a computer costs 11 percent less than buying or leasing a modelone-year older for any given transaction.andM;Computer models introduced one year later have about a 1.6 percent higherrelative performance than the older ones, after the newer models are adjustedfor increase in computer characteristics.andP;  IBM-compatible systems cost moreand have lower performance rates than non-IBM compatible systems withcomparable characteristics.andM;SUGGESTED THEORY-BASED APPROACHandM;Based on Grosch's statement, most previous studies have developed models withthe following form: COST = [alpha].sub.0 + [alpha].sub.1.POWER + [epsilon],where COST and POWER are natural logarithm transformations of computer costand power.andM;For the COST variable, computer prices have frequently been used.andP;  However,other studies have used either average computer prices calculated by dividingthe computer price by performance, or the inverse of the average computerrental prices.andP;  For the POWER variable, past studies have used variables suchas a measure of power developed by the authors, MIPS, benchmark results, mainmemory, or secondary storage.andP;  Some studies have included additionalvariables such as the computer introduction year, an IBM compatibility dummy,computer category dummies, and computer manufacturer dummies.andP;  Table Isummarizes the previous studies.andM;Using regression methods, a coefficient of computer power ([alpha].sub.1.) isestimated and interpreted as an EOS inverse.andP;  If the estimate of[alpha].sub.1 is close to 1/2 (or--1/2 if average cost is used, instead oftotal cost), then the result is used as evidence for the EOS being two.andO;However, we would like to argue that this interpretation is not correct.andO;(The hedonic approach theorized by Rosen and applied to computers by Chow andCole at al.andP;  has a similar expression to Eq.andP;  (1).andP;  However, itsinterpretation of the parameter estimates is different.)andM;We will examine another equation in order to illustrate the problem withinterpreting the coefficient estimate of POWER as a measure of EOS.andP;  Wecreate a new equation by switching dependent and independent variables of Eq.andO;(1) as in the following, POWER = [beta].sub.0 + [beta].sub.1.COST + e.andM;Since both POWER and COST are determined by technical and economic factors,there is no reason why COST should be the only dependent variable; POWERcould also be one.andP;  Therefore, if the inverse of the POWER coefficient in Eq.andO;(1) can be interpreted as EOS, then the coefficient of COST in Eq.andP;  (2)should also be a legitimate candidate for representing EOS.andP;  The question iswhether the coefficient of COST in Eq.andP;  (2) is the inverse of the coefficientof POWER in Eq.andP;  (1).andP;  As shown below, the answer, in general, is negative:In the population, [alpha].sub.1 and [beta].sub.1 can be expressed as,[alpha].sub.1 = cov(POWER, COST)/var(POWER) and [beta].sub.1 = cov(POWER,COST)/var(COST).andP;  Therefore, [alpha.sub.1 x [beta].sub.1 = cov(POWER,COST).sup.2./var(POWER) x var(COST)' which is generally not one.andM;Depending on the degree of correlation between POWER and COST, the differencebetween (1/[alpha].sub.1.) and [beta].sub.1 may be significant.andP;  In order toillustrate this, we estimate Eqs.andP;  (1) and (2) by applying the data used byEin-Dor [6, p. 146-147].andM;The left columns of Table II are the estimation results equivalent to Eq.andO;(1).andP;  The right columns of Table II are the estimation results equivalent toEq.andP;  (2).andP;  For example, Ein-Dor examined the coefficient estimate of In(MIPS)in order to calculate EOS.andP;  He reported that the coefficient estimate forIn(MIPS) is -0.55 and calculated EOS to be 1/(1 - 0.55) since his COST wasaverage price.andP;  (Ein-Dor's estimate, -0.55, is equivalent to -(1 - 0.442) ofTable II.andP;  The difference is due to the computational discrepancies in thestatistical packages used for estimations.)andM;However, if we examine the right columns of Table II, the coefficientestimate of In(PRICE) is 0.858, which is much smaller than two.andP;  If Grosch'sstatement still holds with this data set, then the coefficient estimate ofIn(PRICE) should be close to two.andP;  Since the two estimates describe the samerelation between computer cost and power, we cannot decide which one of thetwo estimates measures EOS for computers.andP;  One of the major reasons for thisdilemma is that both equations simply examine relationships between twovariables without theoretical justification to support the equations.andP;  Thisexample illustrates the importance of the theoretical foundation forempirical studies.andM;MODELS, VARIABLES AND DATAandM;Here we develop a theoretical basis upon which to justify the estimationresults.andP;  We assume that computer performance [upsilon] is generated bycombining various computer characteristics X.sub.i., where i = 1, 2,..., K.andO;Based on he production theory of microeconomics, we define a computerperformance function:andM;After examining various functional forms, we chose to use the Cobb-Douglasfunction which has a double-log form.andP;  The Cobb-Douglas function has been themost widely used for the economic analysis computer performance as shown inTable I.andP;  There are more flexible functional forms than the Cobb-Douglasfunction, such as the translog function.andP;  However, we cannot use the translogfunction, which is a second-order Taylor linear approximation, because of thehigh multicollinearity among variables.andP;  (See Appendix II for discussion ofthe multicollinearity problem.)andM;The Cobb-Douglas computer performance function can be expressed as: where Yis output (computer performance) and X.sub.i is input (computercharacteristic) i, for i = 1, 2,..., K.andP;  By transforming Eq.andP;  (4) withnatural logarithms,andM;As discussed in Appendix I, Eq.andP;  (6) is derived from Eq.andP;  (5) with costminimization and profit maximization assumptions: where [psi].sub.2 is aconstant.andM;EOS can be defined as a sum of marginal contributions of input factors toperformance.andP;  From Eq.andP;  (5), the EOS isandM;If data on computer cost, characteristics and performance are available, thenEq.andP;  (5) and (6) can be estimated and the EOS can be obtained.andP;  Since thesetwo equations describe the same computer mechanism from two differentperspectives, we can estimate both equations and check the degree ofconformity of their results.andM;As noted previously, computer list prices have been traditionally used as ameasure of computer cost.andP;  Concerns have been expressed about using listprices instead of transaction prices.andP;  However, no past studies could useactual transaction prices due to difficulties in obtaining them.andP;  In order topartially overcome problems with list prices, we use both list purchaseprices and lease prices.andP;  Theoretically, lease price is superior to purchaseprice since lease prices are the charges for a specific period of computerusage whereas purchase prices are the charges for the systems which may havevarious life cycles.andM;In the past, Chow, Knight and Solomon used computer lease or rental pricesfor estimation.andP;  However, no study was done with both purchase and leaseprices.andP;  The estimation results with two different prices will provideanother means of cross-checking the validity of the model specification andthe robustness of the estimation results.andP;  In order to control inflationaryeffects on computer prices, we have discounted computer purchase and leaseprices with annual inflation rates.andM;We should choose computer characteristic variables based on technicalconsiderations of the computer operations.andP;  Since characteristics representthe resources used to generate computer performance, we have examine variouscharacteristics such as MIPS, word length, cycle time, main memory size,cache memory size, and number of I/O channels.andP;  We have chosen MIPS, mainmemory size and number of I/O channels after considering the appropriatenessof the variables in representing a particular computer function, its use inprevious studies, and the availability of the data.andM;One of the major difficulties in the analysis of computer performance isdefining a measure of power.andP;  Since computer power depends on the tasks thata computer performs, the power measure based on one task may not bereasonable for a different task.andP;  It would be logical to analyze computerperformance with a multi-output model under the assumption that computertasks can be classified into several categories such as commercially orientedtasks and scientifically oriented tasks.andP;  However, in practice, computerpower data using this degree of refinement is limited to buy a very fewcomputers.andM;We have decided to use the relative performance data as a measure of computerpower.andP;  In this rating system, developed by International Data Corp., an IBM370/158-3 has a rating of 45.andP;  The purpose of a relative performance ratingis to explain how computers compare, in a hierarchical sense, to the IBM370/158-3.andP;  This performance measure puts the computer systems intopespective by offering approximations of their performance.andP;  The majoradvantage of applying the relative performance data to our analysis is thatit is a single number, produced by a single source over the years, and isavailable for various computer systems.andP;  Other computer performance measuressuch as Whetstones and Dhrystones are available only in a limited scope.andP;  Therelative performance data has previously been used for predicting computerperformance.andM;The computer purchase and lease prices, MIPS, main memory size, and number ofI/O channels are obtained from Computerworld.andP;  The computer price is the basesystem list price.andP;  The main memory is the actual main memory size configuredfor the computer price.andP;  The I/O channel is the minimum number of I/Ochannels.andP;  Since some systems have zero value for the I/O channel, wefollowed a common procedure by adding an arbitrarily small value of 10.sup.-6to the variable in order to make logarithm transformation possible for allsystems.andP;  We use the minimum number of I/O channels since the computer priceis for the system configured minimally.andP;  On the other hand, we haveexperimented with other main memory and I/O channel specifications such asmaximum or minimum available main memory size, maximum numbe of available I/Ochannels, and average main memory size or number of I/O channels.andP;  However,the estimation results were not changed significantly.andM;The system's introduction year is obtained from Datapro 70, Computerworldbuyer's guide, and by contacting vendors.andP;  The annual inflation rate isobtained from the Survey of Current Business.andP;  Both mainframes andsuperminicomputers were considered.andP;  A total of 359 computer systems,introduced during the years 1977-1985, were included in the estimation, ofwhich 332 are mainframes and 27 are superminicomputers.andP;  The data set doesnot have many superminicomputers since many of them are not available forlease.andM;ESTIMATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONandM;In order to obtain estimates of the parameters in which we are interested, weneed to estimate the following two equations which are based on Eqs.andP;  (5) and(6), In [upsilon] = A.sub.0 + A.sub.1.1n X.sub.1 + A.sub.2.1n X.sub.2 +A.sub.3.1n X.sub.3 and In C = B.sub.0 + B.sub.1.1n X.sub.1 + B.sub.2.1nX.sub.2 + B.sub.3.1n X.sub.3 + B.sub.4.1n [upsilon], where A.sub.0 andB.sub.0 are constants, A.sub.i = [alpha].Sub.i., B.sub.i =-([alpha].sub.i./[sigma][alpha].sub.i.), for i = 1,2,3 and B.sub.4 = 1 +(1/[sigma][alpha].sub.i), [upsilon] is relative performance, X.sub.1 is MIPS,X.sub.2 is main memory size, X.sub.3  is the number of I/O channels, and C isthe computer purchase or lease price.andM;Many factors other than computer characteristics can influence computerprices and performance.andP;  In order to control these influences, we haveincluded additional variables for the estimation of equations.andP;  Computermanufacturer dummy variables (MFG j) were incorporated in order to controlextraneous effects such as marketing policy or various system configurationsof the vendors on computer prices and performance as discussed by.andP;  Weassigned dummy variables for the manufacturers which appear more than 20times in the data set.andP;  They are MFG1 for Amdahl (29), MFG2 for Burroughs(24), MFG3 for CDC (26), MFG4 for IBM (44), MFG5 for National AdvancedSystems (27), MFG6 for NCR (52), and MFG7 for Sperry/Univac (55).andP;  (Thevalues in parentheses are number of observations in the data set).andP;  We havefewer IBM systems than expected because many of them are not available forlease.andM;There are eight other manufacturers whose systems are included in theestimation, but dummy variables were not assigned because too few systems inthe data set were provided by those manufacturers.andP;  Therefore, we added thefollowing two variables to control the extraneous effects on the computerperformance and price mentioned above.andP;  The first is a dummy variable for IBMcompatibility (IBM-COMPAT) in order to control the effect of IBMcompatibility on the power and price.andP;  the second is a dummy variable formainframes or superminicomputers (MAINFRAMES) IN order to control thedifference in power resulting from computer design and differences in priceresulting from availability of options.andM;A variable for the computer introduction year (INTROD YEAR) is included inorder to control the effect of the computer model's age on computer power andprice.andP;  A variable for the data collection year (DATA COLLECT) is used inorder to control power and price changes over the years.andM;By performing regression analysis on Eqs.andP;  (5-1) and (6-1), we can obtainestimates for EOS, which is the sum of estimates of [alpha].sub.i., for i =1, 2, 3, from the following three sources: Eq.andP;  (5-1), EOS = A.sub.1 +A.sub.2 + A.sub.3, Eq.andP;  (6-1), EOS = 1/(B.sub.4 - 1), and Eqs.andP;  (5-1) and(6-1), EOS = -(A.sub.i/B.sub.i) for i = 1, 2, 3.andM;As we have discussed, we have two different prices for each computer;purchase and lease.andP;  Estimation results of the two equations system, oneequation [Eq.andP;  (5-1)] with power and the other equation [Eq.andP;  (6-1)] witheither purchase price or lease price, are reported in Table III.andP;  (Detailedestimation methods are discussed in Appendix II.)andM;Based on the coefficient estimates reported in Table III, we compute thecorrelation coefficient (R.sup.2.) for each equation as one minus the ratioof the sum of squared residuals to the total sum of squares for the dependentvariable.andP;  The estimates for the correlation coefficient are 0.994 for Eq.andO;(5-1) and 0.923 for purchase prices and 0.927 for the lease prices of Eq.andO;(6-1) indicating that the models are supported reasonably well by the data.andM;From the results of Table III, we have calculated EOS and reported them inTable IV.andP;  Coefficient estimates included for calculating EOS are theestimates which are statistically different from 0 at the 1 percentsignificance level.andP;  The estimate of EOS from the performance function is0.933.andP;  The estimates of EOS from the cost functions are 0.848 for purchaseprice and 0.893 for lease price.andP;  Based on Eq.andP;  (10), we have also computedEOS from -A.sub.i./B.sub.i., for i = 1, 2, and 3.andP;  they are 0.934 with bothpurchase and lease price.andP;  The estimates of EOS are fairly similar to oneanother supporting the relationship given by Eq.andP;  (A9).andP;  All estimates of EOSare less than one.andP;  Therefore, there is no evidence supporting increasingreturns to scale for mainframes and superminicomputers during the years1981-1985.andP;  This result supports Kang et al.andP;  [18] and Mendelson's [22]conclusion.andM;The estimates of the data collection year indicate that computer purchaseprices decrease about 23 percent and lease prices decrease about 15 percenteach year.andP;  The effect of the data collection year on performance is notsignificantly different from 0 at the 10 percent level.andP;  This is a reasonableresult since the year when data is collected should be irrelevant to thelevel of computer performance once the effects of all computercharacteristics are considered.andM;Previously introduced computers which cost more than subsequent models havingsimilar characteristics and performance levels still cost more in later yearsthan their more modern counterparts.andP;  This pricing pattern has been observedboth for purchasing and leasing.andP;  One-year-old models cost 8 percent more forpurchasing and 11 percent more for leasing than newer models with similarcharacteristics.andP;  This result indicates that computer markets are notperfectly competitive and computer vendors do not reduce the prices of oldermodels as much as they should.andP;  If they did, then older models should costless than or equal to newer models with similar computer characteristics forany particular transaction.andM;After controlling all factors such as increased MIPS, main memory size, andnumber of I/O channels, newer models have had higher relative performance:the performance increase is about 1.6 percent each year.andP;  This indicates thatan increase in computer performance is not only generated by an increase invarious computer characteristics, but also by other sources such asinteraction of various characteristics or certain excluded computercharacteristics.andM;IBM compatible systems have cost more than non-IBM compatible systems withcomparable computer characteristics and performance, supporting previousstudy results by [17] and [22].andP;  The cost advantage of non-IBM compatiblesystems over IBM compatible systems is higher for leasing than purchasing.andO;Furthermore, IBM compatible systems have lower relative performance thannon-IBM compatible systems with comparable characteristics.andM;The results also indicate that mainframes cost more but are not significantlydifferent from superminicomputers after considering factors such as computercharacteristics, power, manufacturers' effects and IBM compatibility effects.andO;However, the insignificant price difference between mainframes andsuperminicomputers may be the result of a relatively small number ofsuperminicomputers included in the estimation.andP;  (As discussed, we havedeleted many superminicomputers which are not leased.)andM;Our results indicate that the EOS is close to one, instead of two.andP;  Thisresult implies that a unit processing cost does not decrease as the computersystem becomes larger.andP;  Therefore, MIS managers cannot save money by simplyobtaining larger computers.andP;  In order to allocate computing resources moreefficiently, MIS managers should be more concerned with factors such assoftware issues and manpower issues other than with the size of computerhardware.andM;The result of no scale economies agrees with the present trend ofdecentralized computing resource allocation.andP;  Rapidly increasingtelecommunication technology, popularity of end-user computing, and no gainsfrom scale economies of computer will continue to make decentralizingcomputing power an attractive option.andM;The estimated 31 percent decrease in purchase price and 26 percent decreasein lease price each year reveals how significant the cost of an excesscapacity of computer hardware can be.andP;  MIS managers may need to minimizeexcess capacity of hardware resources unless there are acceptable reasons fornot doing so.andM;Consequently, our research reinforces the importance of the modular approachfor computer systems, which allows upgrading individual computer componentsrather than the whole system.andP;  With the evolution of system modularity, MISmanagers can incrementally increase computing power, rather than replace theexisting system with the new one.andP;  It may not be feasible for someorganizations to adopt this approach because of system constraints.andP;  However,the savings resulting from incremental computing can be significant due tothe rapid growth of computer technology and low EOS.andP;  Therefore, the currentpurchase pattern of computer components rather than a complete computingsystem reflects the rational decision-making of MIS managers.andM;The direction of future research is to analyze other categories of computers.andO;In particular, the analysis should include microcomputers.andP;  Since there areseveral sources available for benchmark tests and prices of microcomputers,the EOS for microcomputers and other interesting economic phenomena may beanalyzed by applying the model developed in this article with slightlydifferent variables.andP;  Another possible research direction is to analyzeseveral categories of computers such as mainframes, minicomputers andmicrocomputers, in order to compare the results for similarities anddifferences.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
