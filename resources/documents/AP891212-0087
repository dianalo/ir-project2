Vietnamaccepted them but criticized the action.   British and colonial officials, ignoring last-minute pleas fromthe United States, Canada and the human rights group AmnestyInternational, said it was more humane to ship the Vietnamese homethan to keep them ``endlessly.''   Some of the Vietnamese screamed for help and one woman waved herhands and cried, ``I don't want to back to Vietnam!''   Several thousand more will be returned within weeks, said HongKong television, quoting an unidentified Vietnamese ForeignMinistry official. A government statement said officials wereconsidering using ships.   The British colony currently houses 56,000 Vietnamese in squalidcamps where violence and malnutrition are rife. Among them, 44,000are considered illegal immigrants and will be sent home unless theycan prove they would face persecution in Vietnam. Hong Kong saysthe refugees have strained its facilities.   Most are considered economic refugees. Many risked their livesin fleeing the poverty of their homeland, putting out to sea inrickety boats.   Japan's Kyodo New Service in Tokyo quoted a Vietnamese ForeignMinistry statement in Hanoi as saying Vietnam accepts voluntaryreturnees but ``will refuse flatly forced repatriation.''   It said the Hong Kong action this time ``violateshumanitarianism'' but that the 51 Vietnamese returned against theirwill would be accepted.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons inLondon that the forcible repatriation is ``perfectly in order'' andthat countries which object should offer them a home.   In Washington, the Bush administration today denounced thereturn as unacceptable.   ``We continue to support the voluntary repatriation ofasylum-seekers as proposed in the comprehensive plan of actionadopted by the Red Cross,'' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwatersaid.   Many U.S. lawmakers expressed outrage at the deportations.   ``This conjures up every picture I have in my mind of World WarII concentration camps,'' said Rep. Chet Atkins, D-Mass.   The jetliner arrived in Hanoi four hours after riot policeentered a detention center and took the Vietnamese under tightsecurity and the cover of darkness.   Vietnamese screamed for help from the windows at the PhoenixHouse detention center during the roundup. Some hung a sign throughthe metal bars, reading: ``Where is your humanity?''   The boat people were quickly pulled away by police, who wereequipped with helmets, shields, revolvers and batons. Sobs could beheard coming from the cells.   Some held their heads in their hands.   The plane carried eight Vietnamese men, 17 women and 26children, the government said in a statement today.   It said the boat people were accompanied by Hong Kong officialsand that the expulsions occurred peacefully.   ``In our view it is more humane to go ahead with therepatriation of those who have been through the whole process ofscreening and appeal than to leave them waiting endlessly incamps,'' it said.   A police convoy of seven trucks shipped the Vietnamese from thedetention center to Kai Tak International Airport. About 200 policeand corrections officers were involved in the operation.   Upon arrival in Hanoi, the 51 Vietnamese were taken to a transitcenter where they will be processed before returning to theprovinces for job placement and training, a diplomatic source inHanoi said.   The government said the repatriation program costs about $1,000per person, with the cost shared equally by the Hong Kong andBritish governments. Each returning adult received $30 and eachchild $15 with the balance given to Vietnamese authorities fordisbursal, the government said.   The Hong Kong government statement said Vietnam has given thecolony ``firm assurances that those returning would not be punishedfor having left clandestinely'' and that their return wouldinitially be monitored by the British Embassy in Hanoi.   It said it hoped the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees wouldwatch their progress, but the relief agency today called themandatory repatriation program ``premature.''   The U.N. group has coordinated a program of voluntaryrepatriation in which 637 Vietnamese boat people have returned totheir Communist homeland since March.   The United States has criticized the expulsion plan, sayingconditions must first improve inside Vietnam.   Some in Hong Kong say forced repatriation will hurt theterritory's chances of obtaining international protection fromCommunist China, which takes control of the colony in 1997.   But Li Hou, a Chinese official speaking in Canton, hailed theexpulsions today.   ``Forced repatriation should have been used long ago,'' said Li,a high-ranking official responsible for Hong Kong affairs.   Opponents of forced repatriation have argued that it couldtrigger violence in the detention centers and lead some to trysuicide. Vietnamese already have staged hunger strikes anddemonstrations to protest being sent home against their will.Several bloody riots have broken out.   Britain claims the program is necessary to deter more boatpeople from fleeing to overcrowded Hong Kong.   More than 170,000 Vietnamese have flocked to Hong Kong since1975, when North Vietnam seized control of South Vietnam followingthe U.S. withdrawal from the Vietnam War.   More than 34,000 arrived from Jan. 1 to Nov. 10.</TEXT></DOC>
