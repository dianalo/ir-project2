In 1850, immersed in a project called ``Siegfried's Tod,'' hevowed that this time he would do it HIS way.   ``I am toying with the boldest of plans,'' the composer wrote toa friend from Zurich, Switzerland, where he was living. ``I wouldhave a theater erected here on the spot, made of planks ... andgive three performances _ free of course _ in the space of a week,after which the theater would then be demolished.''   Twenty-six years later, ``Siegfried's Tod'' had blossomed intofour operas, a 17-hour epic titled ``Der Ring des Nibelungen.'' AndWagner had designed and built his own wooden theater, an acousticalgem with a covered orchestra pit in the town of Bayreuth, Germany.   There the world premiere unfolded on Aug. 13, 14, 16 and 17,1876. Wagner had dreamed of presenting the four operas onsuccessive days, but he realized that would put impossible burdenson the singers. Since then, most productions have added one moreday off, so a typical ``Ring'' cycle takes six days from start tofinish.   Now, thanks to television, American audiences can savor Wagner'smarathon masterpiece the way he conceived it. Beginning tonight,the Public Broadcasing Service will present the MetropolitanOpera's production on four consecutive nights.   It's a $5 million undertaking that should please purists and winnew admirers for Wagner's tale of greed, love and redemption set ina fantastical world populated by mermaids, dwarfs, giants and gods.   The Met's ``Ring'' has been hailed by some critics for itsfaithful approach to Wagner's original intentions and lambasted byothers as stodgy and lacking a modern point of view.   Some productions nowadays put Wotan, Bruennhilde andamp; Co. into timetunnels, nuclear holocausts or 19th-century factories. The Metsticks to Wagner's original settings, which are bizarre enoughwithout updating.   Modern stage technology helps. In the first Bayreuth production,the three Rhinemaidens climbed into an oversize bathing machine forthe opening scene of ``Das Rheingold'' at the bottom of the RhineRiver. At the Met, water is suggested by lighting and a scrimstretched across the stage.   The finale, in which a castle collapses, the river overflows andthe home of the gods goes up in flames, looks awesome thanks to thetrickery of producer Otto Schenk, set designer GuentherSchneider-Siemssen and lighting director Gil Wechsler.   Thanks to tactful editing, the TV version, directed by BrianLarge, actually offers some advantages over the live performances.   First and foremost are the subtitles, which help the listenerthrough those long monologues for which Wagner is notorious. HostF. Murray Abraham introduces each episode and provides useful plotsummaries.   In addition, crucial stage effects that tended to go awry in thetheater work perfectly on TV. The anvil that Siegfried breaks intwo with his magic sword sometimes crumpled too soon in the operahouse, but on TV it splits right on cue.   And singers who sounded vocally stressed in live performancecome off better, because the videotape editors were able to combinethe best moments of several performances from the last two seasons.This is especially true of tenor Siegfried Jerusalem, who looksgreat, acts superbly, but sings erratically in the grueling role ofSiegfried.   Hildegard Behrens' grace and emotional involvement make herBruennhilde memorable, though her voice is not in the league ofheroic sopranos like Kirsten Flagstad and Birgit Nilsson.   One thing TV audiences definitely won't see is the accident inwhich Miss Behrens was hit on the head by a beam that collapsed toosoon at the end of a ``Goetterdaemmerung'' this spring. She was notseriously hurt but missed several later performances.   Other standouts include basses James Morris, a handsome,rich-voiced Wotan, and Matti Salminen, a thundering, malevolentHagen; baritone Ekkehard Wlaschiha and tenor Heinz Zednik as thedeliciously repellent dwarf brothers Alberich and Mime; and mezzoChrista Ludwig, past her vocal prime but still compelling as bothFricka and Waltraute.   As the incestuous brother-and-sister Siegmund and Sieglinde, whoenter the story Tuesday in ``Die Walkuere,'' tenor Gary Lakes andsoprano Jessye Norman sound beautiful. But they are far too amplyproportioned to look or act the parts of impetuous young lovers,especially in closeup.   A couple of minor vocal notes: On Wednesday, in Act Two of``Siegfried,'' we get to hear, but not see, the lovely Dawn Upshawchirping away as the Forest Bird. On Thursday, in the prologue to``Goetterdaemmerung,'' pay attention to the Third Norn. She's ayoung soprano named Andrea Gruber who's destined for bigger andbetter things.</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television ...
