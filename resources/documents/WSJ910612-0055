The court said that rape victims cannot testify in privateunless a judge provides detailed and compelling reasons forbarring the public. That decision, handed down unanimously bythe New York State Court of Appeals, reinforces the long-heldprinciple that criminal defendants ordinarily have aconstitutional right to a public trial.                                                                                                          However, the court said, if sufficient justification isprovided, judges can sometimes make exceptions to protect awitness's identity or to shield a victim from further trauma.   The issue of how to protect the identity of rape victimswhile guaranteeing the constitutional rights of the accusedhas been much in debate recently because of publicitysurrounding the alleged rape of a Palm Beach, Fla., woman byWilliam Kennedy Smith last March. That case hasn't come totrial, but victims-abuse experts are divided on how publicitysurrounding the identity of victims should be handled, evenwhen the case comes to trial.   &quot;There are circumstances where any of us would have atraumatic reaction to confrontation with a person we believeto have violated us,&quot; said John Stein, deputy director of theNational Organization for Victims Assistance, in Washington.At the same time, others note, open trials have long beenheld as the best test of a witness's trustworthiness.   The New York case involved a Syracuse woman who wasallegedly raped in her home by an acquaintance in 1988, thendriven in her car to a hotel, where she managed to escape.During the trial in Onondaga County, N.Y., State Judge J.Kevin Mulory barred the public from his courtroom during thewoman's testimony, over objections of the defense and withoutgiving an explanation. The defendant, Isaiah Clemons, wasconvicted and sentenced to 7 to 21 years in state prison.   On appeal, lawyers for Mr. Clemons, who remains behindbars pending a bond hearing while he awaits a new trial,argued that New York, like all states, requires some findingby the judge detailing why the courtroom should be closed.The U.S. Supreme Court has dictated a four-part test: theneed must be overwhelming; the closure must be as short aspossible; all reasonable alternatives have to be considered;and the judge must detail his reasoning.   None of those conditions were met, the New York high courtruled.   In a companion case, the court also threw out theconviction of a Korean woman serving a minimum 15 yearsentence for selling heroin. In that case, the trial judgebarred the defendant's family from hearing the testimony ofan accomplice-turned-government-witness, who claimed hefeared retaliation. The high court ruled that the family,which was not implicated in any drug trafficking, should havebeen allowed to stay in the courtroom.   ---   BASEBALL STATISTICAL TABLES can be copyrighted, appealscourt rules.   A panel of the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals inManhattan ruled yesterday that a specific compilation ofbaseball statistics is protected by copyright laws. Theruling declared a pitching form published by the AssociatedPress &quot;virtually identical&quot; to a one created by George L.Kregos and ordered the case back to the trial court.   The suit revolves around a pitching form created by Mr.Kregos that provides information about baseball teams and apitcher's past performance in a number of statisticalcategories such as the men-on-base average in recent starts.The court declared that Mr. Kregos's form, which featured acombination of nine items concerning a pitcher's performanceout of thousands of different possible combinations, displaysa &quot;minimal level of creativity&quot; required for copyrightprotection.   The ruling, which may have implications for other types ofcompiled data such as computer spreadsheets, couldpotentially open up the boundaries of copyright law. Thecourt noted last month's U.S. Supreme Court ruling thattelephone book white pages aren't protected by copyright lawsbut stated that other compilations of facts should beconsidered on a case-by-case basis.   &quot;What the ruling does is indicate that you have to look ateach compilation separately and determine whether it isoriginal in terms of the selection and arrangement ofindividual facts,&quot; said Michael A. Epstein, head ofintellectual property practice at Weil, Gotshal andamp; Manges. &quot;Itleaves open exactly what is the line between compilationsthat are protectable under copyright and those that aren't.&quot;   Associated Press officials couldn't be reached forcomment.   ---   HOLDER SUIT alleges Rorer falsely denied merger rumors todepress stock.   Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. was sued in New York districtcourt for allegedly misleading shareholders duringnegotiations that led to its formation through a merger,announced in March 1990. The suit, which seeks class-actionstatus, alleges that Rorer Group Inc. publicly denied anyrumors of negotiations for a business alliance while activelydiscussing the possible merger with Rhone Poulenc S.A., basedin France.   The suit alleges Rorer intended to &quot;artificially depressthe market price&quot; of its shares to complete the transaction,which depended on Rorer shareholders' receiving a substantialpremium for their shares.   &quot;Even if you're doing something for your shareholders, itdoesn't justify false and misleading statements to keep itquiet,&quot; said John Halebian, the attorney representingshareholder United Funds Inc. Mr. Halebian cited the 1988Supreme Court decision Basic Inc. vs. Levinson, which he saysestablishes that while companies needn't voluntarily disclosesuch activities, it shouldn't deny them either. A number oflower court decisions shy away from forcing disclosure ofcontingency plans.   Rhone-Poulenc Rorer officials couldn't be reached forcomment.   ---   COMPUTER HACKER will serve a year and a day for wirefraud.   Leonard Rose Jr., 32 years old, was sentenced in Baltimorefederal district court on Monday, about two months after hepleaded guilty to charges of transmitting American Telephoneandamp; Telegraph Co. software to friends.   Mr. Rose, a computer consultant, gained access to an ATandamp;Tprogram called Unix and then modified the software so that he-- or anyone else who received the doctored version -- couldcollect the identification codes and passwords of legitimateUnix users, said Geoff R. Garinther, an assistant U.S.attorney who prosecuted the case. A commercial license forthe Unix system costs $77,000.   Under the plea agreement, prosecutors dropped charges ofcomputer fraud and interstate transportation of stolenproperty in exchange for Mr. Rose's guilty plea on the morelimited wire fraud charges.   Some attorneys had hoped that Mr. Rose's case would forcethe courts to reach a consensus on whether electronic textcan be considered stolen property. They were also eager totest the constitutionality of the computer fraud and abuseact, which makes it a crime to pass information that can beused to gain access to computer files, said his attorney,Jane Macht of Catterton, Kemp andamp; Mason in Rockville, Md.Because of the plea bargain, however, such issues weren'taddressed.   As part of the sentence, Mr. Rose agreed to sell hiscomputer equipment, which was seized in raids on his homes inMiddletown, Md., and Naperville, Ill., in February andOctober of 1990. He will begin serving his sentence in earlyJuly.   ---   NOTED: Daniel M.
