As discussed below, the Commissionis approving this proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26000 (August 16, 1988),32 FR 31947.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Description</ITAG>The proposal would authorize DTC to establish a new method for participants,particularly broker-dealer participants, to segregate customer fully-paid-forsecurities against unintended delivery by creating a ``memo'' positionwithin a participant's free account. This ``memo'' position allows participantsto protect from unintended delivery a designated quantity of customer fully-paid-forsecurities that are in the participant's free account or may be receivedduring the daily processing cycle. Securities would remain in the memoposition until the participant provides DTC with new instructions to removethem from the memo position or until the participant reduces the positionby executing eligible transactions that are normally customer transactions.Withdrawals-by-transfer, certificates-on-demand withdrawals, and free deliveryorders that are not indentified as stock loan or stock loan returns wouldbe considered eligible transactions which would be used to reduce the securitiesin both the memo position and the free account position.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ DTC presumes that these activities are customer transactionsand, therefore, once satisfied from a participant's free account position,are no longer anticipated customer securities that need protection.By using memo segregation, participants can submit instructions on theevening of T+4 to deliver securities which they expect to receive on T+5out of the free account and protect customer fully-paid-for securitiesin the free account from delivery. If on T+5 there are not enough non-segregatedsecurities in the account to fill the order, the delivery order will recycleuntil enough non-segregated securities are in the account to fill the order.DTC developed the memo segregation service to assist participant broker-dealersto comply with Exchange Act requirements concerning segregation of customerfully-paid for securities.\4\<NOTE/> This service supplements other related DTC account structuresto protect participant customer fully-paid-for securities from unrelatedor intra-day DTC liens, such as segregated accounts and the conduit accounts.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Rule andSection;240.15c-3 requires, among other things,that a broker-dealer obtain and thereafter maintain possession or controlof all fully-paid-for or excess margin securities held for the accountsof customers. Broker-dealers may deposit these securities with registeredclearing agencies, such as DTC, for safekeeping.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Currently, to protect customer fully-paid-for securities,broker-dealers must segregate customer fully-paid-for securities in a segregatedaccount which prevents these securities from being used for any transactionswhile they are held in the segregated account. Securities in a segregatedaccount may not be delivered out until those securities are transferredto the participant's free account. A participant also may open a conduitaccount to receive certain securities (<T3>e.g., </T3>stock-loan deliveries). A participant issues instructionsto DTC to deliver securities out of this account rather than the participant'sfree account. Participants usually use a conduit account to make a deliveryusing securities it expects to receive that day.DTC has been operating the memo segregation service since August 1988,under the terms of a temporary approval order.\6\<NOTE/> DTC has informed the Commission that during the pilot period12 broker-dealers used the service and submitted approximately 65 memosegregation instructions per day. DTC has experienced no operational problemswith this service. According to DTC, its participants have not experiencedany operational problems with the service.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26000 (August 16, 1988),53 FR 31947.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Telephone conversation between Carl Urist, Deputy GeneralCounsel, DTC and Cynthia Psoras Staff Attorney, Commission, October 12,1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. DTC's Rationale</ITAG>DTC believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirementsof action 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act in that it is designed to assure thesafeguarding of securities and funds which are in the custody or controlof the clearing agency. DTC believes that implementing this service willassist broker-dealers in complying with Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3. In addition,DTC states that the participants which have used this service during thepilot period believe that it improved their ability to comply with CommissionRule 15c3-3 by increasing the number of automated deliveries which canbe made without violating the Rule 15c3-3 requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion</ITAG>The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with section 17A(b)(3)(A) and (F) of the Act. The Commission also agrees with DTC that the proposalwill allow broker-dealer participants to increase the number of automateddeliveries made through DTC and, at the same time, provide broker-dealerparticipants with an additional tool to aid them in protecting customerfully-paid-for securities as required by Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3. In addition,DTC has operated memo segregation for two months without any significantoperational problems. Based on DTC's experience, the Commission believesthat full implementation of memo segregation will promote the prompt andaccurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and improveDTC's ability to safeguard customer fully-paid-for securities within itscustody or control.DTC provides custodial services for its participants, including banks andbroker-dealers. Broker-dealers trade for their own accounts and act ascustodians for customers. Rule 15c3-3 requires brokers, acting in a custodialcapacity, to maintain possession or control over such customer fully-paid-forsecurities.DTC's custodial services are one of several alternative means for participantsto maintain their own and customer securities. Other custodial arragementsinclude: (1) The retention of the physical securities in the broker-dealer'svault; (2) a custodial arrangement with a custodial bank or another broker-dealer;and (3) an arrangement with other registered depositories. DTC has no wayof knowing which, if any, securities in its possession or control representcustomer fully-paid-for securities. Moreover, under section 8(c) of theAct and Rule 8c-1(g) thereunder, DTC is under an obligation to deliverfully-paid-for securities to its participants.The Commission believes that memo segregation provides a useful aid tobroker-dealers in managing their depository accounts and their inventorycontrols to assure possession or control of customer fully-paid-for securities.Before DTC offered the memo segregation enhancement, participants protectedcustomer fully-paid-for securities from delivery by placing them in a separateaccount or sub-account. When a participant's customers wanted to transferthese securities, the participant was required to take the additional stepof transferring the securities into his free account before the securitiescould be delivered out of the account. The Commission believes that memosegregation provides participants with more flexibility, eliminates theneed for additional transfers to protect customer fully-paid-for securitieswithin the participant's free account, and allows for automated deliverorders to be executed through DTC.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds that the proposedrule change is consistent with the Act and, in particular, section 17A.<T3>It is therefore ordered, </T3>Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-DTC-88-16) be, and hereby is,approved.For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation pursuant to delegatedauthority.<ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
