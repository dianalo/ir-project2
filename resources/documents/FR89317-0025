Background </ITAG>Section 102(c) of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act(MPRSA) of 1972, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 1401 <T3>et seq., </T3>gives the Administrator of EPA the authority to designatesites where ocean disposal may be permitted. On December 23, 1986, theAdministrator delegated the authority to designate ocean disposal sitesto the Regional Administrator of the Region in which the sites are located.The Pensacola (offshore) ODMDS is in Region IV and the designation is beingmade pursuant to that authority. The EPA Ocean Dumping Regulations (40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter H, andSection;228.4) indicate that ocean disposal sites will be designated by promulgationin this Part 228. A list of ``Approved Interim and Final Ocean DumpingSites'' was published on January 11, 1977 (42 FR 2461 [January 11, 1977]).<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Environmental Impact Statement Development </ITAG>Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969,as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq., </T3>requires that Federal agencies prepare an EnvironmentalImpact Statement (EIS) on proposals for legislation and other major Federalactions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The object of NEPA is to build careful consideration of all environmentalaspects of proposed actions into the agency decision-making process. WhileNEPA does not apply to EPA activities of this type, EPA has voluntarilycommitted to prepare EISs in connection with ocean disposal site designationssuch as this (see 39 FR 16186 [May 7, 1974]). EPA, in cooperation withthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) and the U.S. Navy, has prepareda Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and FEIS entitled ``Designationof a New Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site, Pensacola, Florida.'' Thepreceding Proposed Rule (53 FR 50977 [December 19, 1988]) and this FinalRule are procedural follow-ups to the EIS. This Final Rule includes excerptsfrom the Proposed Rule which included excerpts from the EIS. The EIS maybe used as reference, especially for literature citations, which are notcited herein (two exceptions in this Final Rule). The action proposed in the EIS is the designation of a new ODMDS offshorePensacola, Florida. The purpose of this Final Rulemaking action is to designate,on a permanent basis, a new environmentally-acceptable ODMDS as an oceanoption for the disposal of restricted suitable dredged material. The needfor ocean disposal is determined on a case-by-case basis as part of theprocess of issuing permits for the transport of dredged material for disposal.The COE and EPA evaluate all dredged material disposal projects in accordancewith the EPA criteria given in the Ocean Dumping Regulations (40 CFR Parts220-229), the COE regulations (33 CFR 209.120 and 209.145), and any Statecomments concerning consistency with a State coastal zone management program.The COE also issues permits to all applicants for transport of dredgedmaterial intended for disposal after compliance with the same regulationsis determined. The COE also undergoes a public review process for its owndisposal actions. EPA has the right to disapprove any ocean disposal projectif it believes that all provisions of MPRSA and the associated implementingregulations have not been met. Although State permits may be required fordredging activities, they would not be needed at the Pensacola (offshore)ODMDS since the disposal site is located outside Florida State waters.The Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on January 29, 1988 (53 FR 2640 [January 29,1988]). On June 10, 1988, the Notice of Availability of the DEIS for public  reviewand comment was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 21914 [June 10, 1988]). The public commentperiod on the DEIS closed July 25, 1988. Distribution of the DEIS resultedin some mailing returns; attempts were made to redistribute such returns.The Notice of Availability of the FEIS for public review and comment waspublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 23, 1988 (53 FR 37044 [September23, 1988]). The public comment period was to close on October 24, 1988,but was extended by EPA to November 14, 1988 (see announcement in <T4>Federal Register </T4>in 53 FR 44658 [November 4, 1988]). The FEISaddressed the comments received on the DEIS. Distribution of the FEIS alsoresulted in some mailing returns; attempts were again made to redistributesuch returns. Also, replacement pages for Appendix B in the FEIS were distributedto the FEIS mailing list addressees at the end of the original FEIS reviewperiod (original review period was extended to allow some review time forAppendix B replacement pages). Review comment letters received by EPA onthe FEIS are addressed in this Final Rule as opposed to the preceding ProposedRule. On December 19, 1988, the Proposed Rule for the Pensacola (offshore) ODMDSwas published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 50977 [December 19, 1988]). The publiccomment period for the Proposed Rule closed on January 18, 1989. One commentletter from the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) dated within theProposed Rule comment period was received by EPA. In addition, a relatedfollow-up letter was requested and received by EPA from the Minerals ManagementService (MMS) within DOI, written comments from the COE were requestedand received by EPA, EPA provided a letter (with COE's letter attached)to DOI requesting a DOI follow-up letter, and DOI provided the follow-upletter to EPA. Also during this general time, telephone coordination occurredbetween EPA and the COE (Mobile District and Panama City, FL office), MMS(New Orleans (Metairie), LA), DOI (Washington, DC), State of Florida (Tallahassee,FL), the U.S. Navy (Charleston, SC) and the Escambia County Florida MarineRecreation Committee (MRC: Pensacola, FL). Topics included artificial reefpermitting, oil and gas lease block/ODMDS use conflicts, FEIS comment letters,DOI's lease block comments on the Proposed Rule, Final Rule publicationand designation schedule, Final Rule development and/or artificial reefuse. As a follow-up to discussions with MRC, in which EPA primarily requestedinformation on artificial reef use, MRC provided a letter dated January16, 1989, discussing artificial reef use as well as providing other comments/concerns.Although this letter was received after the close of the FEIS comment period,it was dated within the Proposed Rule comment period and concerned theFEIS and site designation in general. This letter is addressed in thisFinal Rule in association with the responses to the comment letters onthe FEIS. The EIS discusses the need for the designation of the Pensacola (offshore)ODMDS. EPA is designating the new ODMDS off Pensacola, Florida at thistime to accommodate the Navy's anticipated disposal needs for predominantlyfine-grained dredged material that meets the Ocean Dumping Criteria, butis not suitable for beach nourishment or disposal in the existing, EPA-designatedPensacola (nearshore) ODMDS (that site is restricted to disposal of suitablesandy dredged material). The U.S. Navy has proposed to establish a newhomeport at Pensacola for the aircraft carrier <T3>USS Kitty Hawk </T3>and one naval reserve patrol craft. The <T3>USS Lexington, </T3>currently based at Pensacola, will be moved toCorpus Christi, Texas as part of the overall Gulf Coast Strategic HomeportProject. The proposed project will require deepening of the existing channelto the Naval Air Station (NAS) at Pensacola. Approximately 4.1 millioncubic yards (mcy) of new work dredged material from the turning basin andchannel is initially proposed for disposal in the new ODMDS. The U.S. Navyhas applied for a section 103 permit for the transport of this materialto the new ODMDS. In the future, the ODMDS could also be used for disposal of maintenancematerial dredged from the Navy's channel, the Pensacola Harbor Ship Channel,or other private or Federal dredging projects provided the material meetsthe criteria specified in MPRSA. Additional section 103 permit review wouldbe required prior to the use of the new ODMDS for any dredged materialother than the initial 4.1 mcy proposed for disposal. Additional dredgedmaterial testing and NEPA documentation may also be required. Only materialthat meets the Ocean Dumping Criteria and is not suitable for beach nourishmentwould be placed in the site. Ocean disposal site alternatives to the ODMDS being designated were examinedin the EIS. Three alternative sites (Sites ``A'', ``B'' and ``C'') locatedin the mid-Continental Shelf area were initially selected for study. Allthree sites were located within an economically and operationally feasibleradius (20 miles) from Pensacola Pass. The sites chosen for detailed investigation,Sites ``B'' and ``C'', covered approximately 19 square miles each. Thisarea was considered large enough that an ODMDS could be located withinthe area. Alternative Site ``A'' is located within Florida State waters, as definedby the State of Florida (10.36 statute miles).<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>(Note:</T4> EPA defines the breadth of Florida State waters as threemiles per the Clean Water Act, as amended.)</ITAG> Alternative Site ``A'' is a four-mile area located approximately 13 statutemiles southwest of Pensacola Pass in depths of 60 to 70 feet. During theinitial evaluations, this site was eliminated because it had no apparentenvironmental advantages, would be more expensive to use than either ofthe two other alternative sites because it was farther from Pensacola Pass,and was adjacent to Alabama State waters which would complicate the coordinationprocess. Alternative Site ``B'' is also located within Florida State waters, asdefined by Florida. The northern side of the site is approximately sevenstatute miles southeast of Pensacola Pass. Depths in the area range from60 to 87 feet and the bottom is generally classified as compacted sand.Site B was not selected for locating the ODMDS because one permitted andtwo existing artificial reefs were located within the eastern portion ofthe site. It should also be noted that water depths at the safety fairwayportion of Site B (western portion of Site B) are generally shallow forreceipt of dredged material disposal relative to the minimum 65-foot water-depthclearance specified by the U.S. Coast Guard, New Orleans District. Alternative Site ``C'', the selected site, is located seaward of Statewaters, as defined by Florida, with the exception of a small portion ofthe northwest corner. The northern side of Site ``C'' is approximately11 statute miles south of Pensacola Pass. Depths in the area range from60 to 95 feet and the bottom is generally classified as compacted sandand shell hash. The present Final Rulemaking action is the final designation of a new ODMDSfor Pensacola located within the selected alternative Site ``C''. ThisODMDS is located entirely outside of State waters. A numerical dispersionmodel (Disposal From An Instantaneous Dump: DIFID Model), available atthe U.S. Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station, was used to simulatethe disposed material as it descends through the water column and spreadsover the ocean bottom under varying hydrodynamic conditions. The resultsof all the model simulations indicated that 100% of the sand and silt/clayclumps fell to the bottom within less than 100 seconds of the beginningof the disposal operation. In addition, the simulations indicated thatthis material fell directly beneath the discharge barge, regardless ofthe input data, describing the oceanographic conditions of the site. Theactual deposits of each of these solids fractions were different in thatthe sand tended to cover a large area of bottom at a lesser thickness thandid the silt/clay clumps. The non-cohesive silts and clays did not behavein a similar fashion with a large percentage of these particles remainingsuspended in the water column after disposal. Depending upon the ambientconditions, these particles can be transported from the dump location asa turbidity plume. The area affected by the plume varies greatly, dependingprimarily upon the type of material disposed. The area with suspended solidsconcentrations of more than 10 parts per million (ppm) would cover approximately300 acres, 90 minutes after discharge, under worst-case conditions, i.e.,95% silt/clay. Since approximately 93% of the 4.1 mcy to be disposed canbe classified as sand or silt/clay clumps, a management plan was devisedto utilize this material to form a submerged containment area (a horseshoe-shapedberm) into which the non-cohesive material would then be disposed. Themodel results, the management plan, and the comments received on the DEISwere used to define the actual coordinates of the area to be designatedas the ODMDS. For additional details on the model and the management plan,see Appendices H and I of the FEIS, respectively. Nineteen comment letters on the FEIS were received from sixteen commentersby EPA by the close of the extended comment period (November 14, 1988).The three additional letters were comprised of two follow-up letters (onewithin the comment period and one subsequently) and one inadvertent duplicate(but individually dated) letter. One additional letter provided commentson the FEIS and site designation in general. This letter, which was receivedafter the FEIS comment period but was dated within the Proposed Rule commentperiod, is addressed below in association with FEIS responses.Comments from nine of the sixteen commenters were not substantive. Thesecommenters were Florida State University (Department of Biology: Tallahassee,FL), Department of Health andamp; Human Resources (Centers for Disease Control,Atlanta, GA), Department of the Air Force (Eastern Region: Atlanta, GA),Northwest Florida Water Management District (Havana, FL), Florida Departmentof Agriculture andamp; Consumer Services (Tallahassee, FL), U.S. Departmentof Housing and Urban Development (Atlanta Regional Office: Atlanta, GA),West Florida Regional Planning Council (Pensacola, FL; cover letter withcomments attached), the Department of the Navy (Naval Air Station: Pensacola,FL), and the Department of the Army (South Atlantic Division: Atlanta,GA). The nature of these comments were either complimentary, and/or ofthe no comments, no adverse impact, or general compliance variety. Also,in one instance, no comments were provided due to reviewer scheduling problems.The West Florida Planning Council provided a follow-up letter to theirinitial comments, which indicated ``[n]o additional comments'' for theAppendix B replacement pages. One inadvertent duplicate letter was alsoreceived. Comments from the remaining seven commenters were substantive. These commenterswere Florida State University (Department of Oceanography: Tallahassee,FL), U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (Gulfof Mexico OCS Region: New Orleans, LA), Sport Fishing Institute (Washington,DC), Mote Marine Laboratory (Sarasota, FL), Florida Department of State(Division of Historical Resources: Tallahassee, FL; cover letter with previousletter to the U.S. Navy attached); Board of County Commissioners (EscambiaCounty: Pensacola, FL; cover letter with comments attached); and the Stateof Florida (Office of the Governor: Tallahassee, FL; cover letter withcomments attached). In addition to these seven letters, a follow-up letterwas received from the Florida Department of State (Division of HistoricalResources: Tallahassee, FL). Also, a letter providing comments on the FEISand site designation in general was received from the Escambia County,Florida, Marine Recreation Committee (Pensacola, FL; cover letter withcomments attached) after the FEIS comment period but dated within the ProposedRule comment period. The comments in these nine letters are briefly summarizedbelow, with responses provided. The comments in the Florida State University letter were technical, critical,and concerned the original Appendix B of the FEIS relative to modelingand ``* * * the extent to which the model reproduces the observed currents.''The commenter summarized the FEIS as concluding that observed currentswere longshore in direction and principally wind-driven, which the commenterfelt was ``not surprising'' since this was a documented phenomenon. Ofinterest to the commenter was that ``* * * we would hope to learn the extentthe flow would be onshore or offshore, particularly in the near bottomlayer_as we are concerned about the motion of dumped dredging materials.''The commenter also summarized the FEIS as indicating that subtle differencesin direction (about 10anddegrees;) ``* * * determine whether flow is onshoreor offshore'' depending on water column stratification (when stratified,flow is onshore in the bottom layer versus offshore when unstratified).The commenter felt that important differences in current transport patternsdue to stratification were ``ignored'' in the modeling work and that thedifficulty associated with model calibration to include stratificationaspects was not justification for assuming neutral stratification. Instead,the difficulty of the problem was justification for first-rate modeling.The commenter cited several figures in the FEIS (e.g., Fig. 5) that presented``* * * comparisons between modeled and observed flow direction'' and exhibiteda difference in direction of typically 20anddegrees; (45anddegrees; in Fig.8), so that ``* * * the <T3>observed flow </T3>is usually more towards the coast than the <T3>modeled flow.'' </T3>Therefore, it was indicated that the likelihoodof dredged material being carried back to shore would be considerably greaterthan the model predicted. The commenter was also critical of Figures 10-20which were felt to show ``serious'' differences between the model and observations.Differences listed were the omission of a series of ``events'' (Fig. 12)and frequent approximate doubling of velocities, ``wrong'' directions (Fig.13), and ``serious phase shift'' errors (e.g., Fig. 14 and 15). The author,therefore, disagreed with the FEIS which indicated, despite these ``continued,significant errors,'' that figures showed reasonable agreement betweenoverall current magnitudes and directions. The commenter questioned howgreat the differences would have to be before the FEIS would conclude thatthe figures did not show good agreement. It was also pointed out that quantitativecomparisons were not made. The Florida State University letter also presented five other specificconcerns (excerpted): 1. Coastal trapped waves propagate generally to the west along the Gulfcoast. It is <T3>essential, </T3>therefore, that any adequate model of nearshore currentsinclude not only the local winds at Pensacola but also the forcing by distantwinds to the east. The winds as far away as Tampa and Key West probablycontribute significantly. Was this investigated? 2. No quantitative comparison is shown between the results of the modeland the observed currents. The comparison, in fact, now seems biased infavor of the model; during March the water is unlikely to be stratified.What would a comparison in August show? 3. If velocities were calculated in the model at ten levels (in the vertical)why were comparisons made at only two levels? Figure 4, page B-54, suggeststhat 6 levels might be the minimum necessary. However, veering in a boundarylayer is not unique to Pensacola. 4. I have been unable to tell from the report, the offshore extent of thebottom topography in the model. If they do not continue the model out intodeep water, this will guarantee that the free waves will not travel atthe correct speed_and perhaps explain some of the strange phase problemsin their results. 5. In the first part of the analysis section, pages B-25 through B-31,a great deal of description is given to quantities that could be computedfrom the data, including normal spectral analysis. It appears, however_atleast in my copy of the report_that none of these derived or computed quantitiesare presented. Is the report incomplete?In the letter's final paragraph, the commenter again disagreed with theFEIS conclusion that the comparisons (between observed data and modeledresults) were in ``relatively good agreement.'' The FEIS conclusion wasquestioned, given the considerable accuracy required to assess the problem.The commenter indicated that ``[t]he whole purpose of doing current meterwork and numerical modeling is to allow accurate, reliable predictionsof where suspended sediment will be carried.'' The commenter did not believethat such a predictive capability could ``* * * possibly come from themodel results presented * * *'' in the FEIS. In response to these comments, it should be stated that the goal of thiswork was not to advance the state of modeling or to conduct a detailedoceanographic investigation of the region of Pensacola, Florida, but ratherto extrapolate a current climatology from specific current meter samples.Also, the concern was not with typical currents, but rather with thosecapable of moving local sandy bottom materials. This led to a simple modelthat was tuned to strong currents in a well-mixed water column. This informationwas then utilized to project, under conservative circumstances, the responseof materials discharged into the proposed ODMDS. The results of these effortsare presented in the body of the FEIS and Appendix H. With regard to stratification, the statement on page B-52 of the FEIS mayhave been misconstrued. Stratification was not neglected because of modelingdifficulties, but rather because the interest was in flows sufficient tomove material in 20 meters of water. Such flows are virtually always wellmixed. Moreover, it was not evident that incorporating stratification wouldprovide better accuracy owing to uncertainties in specifying its parameters(heating, cooling, freshwater runoff, etc.). During the application ofthe DIFID Model to project movement of material (see FEIS Appendix H),the impact of a stratified water column was investigated. Comparison ofthese results to a scenario utilizing a well-mixed water column did notshow any change. This is likely due to the depths within the proposed ODMDS,the draft of the loaded dump scow proposed for use, and the nature of thematerial to be disposed. Relative to comparisons between the model results and observed data, comparisonsrelate to high speeds to emphasize intervals in which bottom material moves.These comparisons (both velocity and direction) are much better than forlower speeds, which were of little interest. It is unlikely that detailsof low-speed current structure could have ever been resolved since manyof these are due to randomness and sub-scale phenomena. Pertaining to the five specific concerns excerpted above from the commentletter, the following responses are offered: andbullet; <T3>Concern 1: </T3>Little evidence was found either in the data or a literaturereview to suggest that currents resulting from non-local mechanisms (freewaves, trapped waves, edge waves, etc.) are strong enough to move significantquantities of local bottom material. Also, the strong, open Gulf, LoopCurrent is unlikely to come this close to shore. To account for the possibleoccurrence of this phenomenon, however, a scenario was investigated utilizingthe DIFID Model described above. In this scenario, current velocities of2.54 feet per second, constant with depth, towards the northeast (shoreward)were input to determine the extent of movement of fine-grained materialsdischarged into the ODMDS. Although some movement of material from thesite is expected to occur during these conditions, impacts to significantresources are not predicted due to the location of the ODMDS. andbullet; <T3>Concern 2: </T3>How well the model predictions might have been forAugust was not investigated because the interest was in velocities strongenough to move materials deposited on the bottom. At these times, summerand fall, the water column will not remain stratified. andbullet; <T3>Concern 3: </T3>Comparisons were only made at water column levels atwhich current meter data had been collected; therefore, not all ten modeledlevels were compared. andbullet; <T3>Concern 4: </T3>Regarding ``the offshore extent of the bottom topographyof the model,'' the model bottom topography grid extended offshore to 28.5anddegrees;N latitude. andbullet; <T3>Concern 5: </T3>Relative to the lack of analyses actually in the FEISanalysis section, all analysis details were not included in the reportbecause of their bulk. However, a separate analysis appendix can be madeavailable. In response to the commenter questioning the predictive capability of themodel, it may be stated that the results of this data collection, analysis,and modeling effort were only a portion of the total effort undertakenduring the designation process for the proposed ODMDS. As indicated earlier,the goal of this work was not to advance the state of modeling or to conducta detailed oceanographic investigation. As such, the information presentedin Appendix B must be utilized in combination with the other efforts presentedin the FEIS to determine the suitability of the proposed location as anODMDS and to describe the possible impacts associated with its use. The letter from the U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals ManagementService, also provided substantive comments. The Department's review presentedeight concerns. Specifically, the Department indicated that: (1) No follow-uptextual discussions were presented for the three adverse environmentalimpacts (water quality, bathymetric alteration, and benthos smothering)listed in the FEIS cover sheet (it was noted, however, that the text didnot indicate adverse impacts); (2) inclusion of the dimensions of the navigationchannel in Section 2-1 would be beneficial; (3) it was unclear where previousocean disposal of fine-grained material had occurred since the existingdisposal site near Pensacola was rejected for the U.S. Navy's homeportingproject, as it was restricted to coarse sediments; (4) the text was ``unnecessarilyconfusing'' relative to referencing alternative Sites B and C versus rejectedalternative sites; (5) the discussion in Section 4.03 on barrier islandevolution was felt inaccurate since the islands were apparently formedby headland erosion and spit elongation rather than dune ridge submergence;(6) the description of the bottom topography in Section 5.02 as ``relativelyflat'' but also as ``highly irregular'' were felt to describe differentterrains; (7) fisheries statements in Section 5.03 were believed to betoo general since the commenter indicated that a great deal was known aboutcertain commercial species in the northern Gulf of Mexico as opposed tothe general life-cycle of fish and shellfish in the northern Gulf, andthat Gulf species spawn in ``nearshore waters near passes and estuaries''as opposed to ``the waters of the Gulf,'' and (8) Appendix A (pg. 3) didnot present the results of discussed bathymetric surveys conducted to identifypotential live/hard bottom communities. In response to these eight concerns, the following is offered: andbullet; <T3>Concern 1: </T3>The three adverse impacts listed in the cover sheetare discussed in Sections 5.02, 5.07, 5.14, and 5.21. In these sections,it is indicated that although these impacts are adverse, they are not consideredsignificant. These impacts, therefore, did not preclude designation ofan ODMDS within Site C. andbullet; <T3>Concern 2: </T3>Regarding the dimensions of the navigation channel,the U.S. Navy Homeport action was described in detail in the U.S. NavyGulf Strategic Homeport Project FEIS filed with EPA in January 1987. Theinformation presented in that document was incorporated by reference intothis EIS. The actual size of the channel is not relevant to the designationprocess for the proposed ODMDS and therefore was not included.andbullet; <T3>Concern 3: </T3>Fine-grained material has historically been disposedin land disposal sites or open estuarine waters. These alternatives werediscussed in the U.S. Navy FEIS referenced above. This document concludedthat the only option suitable for disposal of the quantity of fine-grainedmaterial associated with the Homeporting action was ocean disposal. Also,the Pensacola (nearshore) ODMDS was not restricted to sandy material untilit was permanently designated by EPA with grain-size restrictions on May9, 1988. andbullet; <T3>Concern 4: </T3>Section 1.0 of the FEIS is a concise summary of theinformation presented in the body of the FEIS. As such, it describes theneed for ocean disposal, alternatives which were eliminated prior to detailedinvestigation, and the sites at which detailed field investigations wereundertaken. Alternative Sites B and C received detailed study, which wasdescribed in the body of the FEIS (Section 3.0). andbullet; <T3>Concern 5: </T3>The discussion of barrier island evolution in the Pensacolaarea in Section 4.03 is from the published literature, particularly: Hoyt, J.H. 1967. Barrier island information. Geol. Soc. Am. Bull. 78:1125-1136.Shepard, F.P., F.B. Phleger, and T.H. van Andel (eds.). Recent Sediments,Northwest Gulf of Mexico. A Symposium 1951-1958. AAPG, Tulsa, OK. 394 pp.If additional information exists that indicates that the results publishedin this literature are inaccurate, appropriate citations may be providedto EPA or the COE at the addresses provided above. andbullet; <T3>Concern 6: </T3>The information on bottom topography presented in Section5.02 may have been misconstrued. The first description is of the bottomtopography of the sites investigated in detail, i.e., relatively flat.The next sentence describes the bottom topography of the Continental Shelf,offshore Pensacola, in general terms. Therefore, the description as presentedin Section 5.02 is accurate. andbullet; <T3>Concern 7: </T3>Thank you for your fisheries comments. andbullet; <T3>Concern 8: </T3>Sections 4.10, 5.02, and 5.10 of the FEIS and paragraphs5 and 8 of Appendix A indicate that no areas of live/hard bottom were identifiedfrom the literature searched or areas surveyed within either Site B orC. The Sport Fishing Institute's comments were generally critical of the FEISfisheries information. Two specific comments and two subcomments were presented:(1) The FEIS ``* * * does not address the affected recreational fisheries;''the magnitude of the recreational fisheries (artificial reefs, etc.) relativeto ``* * * participation, economic impact, and catch should be quantified;''(2) ``* * * the FEIS should be rejected * * *'' since Section 5.09 (whichwas described as ``incomplete and inaccurate''), addresses impacts on variousactivities including recreational fishing. Under this second point, theletter indicated that: (a) Loss of habitat at the disposal site would ultimatelyresult in loss of fish `` * * * due to decreased spawning and predator-preyopportunities'' even though fish are mobile and could avoid direct effectsduring discharges, and (b) although Site B would affect three artificialreefs and Site C four reef sites, no efforts for ecological and economicimpact calculations or for mitigation were provided. The commenter concluded that ``* * * the FEIS is inadequate because itfails to address fisheries in any meaningful way'' and that ``[p]otentialnegative effects exist * * * '' which should be estimated. Also, adverseimpacts to fisheries should be mitigated if the project is undertaken.In response to these concerns, the following is offered: andbullet; <T3>Concern 1: </T3>The importance of recreational fisheries to the economyof the northern Gulf Coast and the Pensacola area in particular is a wellknown fact, although poorly documented. Section 4.11 of the FEIS discussesthe location of artificial reefs in the Pensacola area, the compositionof the fishery utilizing these reefs, non-reef community composition, andthe shrimp fishery of the area. Sections 5.03, 5.05, 5.07, 5.09, 5.13,5.14, and 5.18 discuss the possible impacts to the fishery-related resourcesthat would result from the utilization of an ODMDS at the recommended site(Site C) for the disposal of suitable dredged material. As depicted in Figure 4-2 in the FEIS (pg. 4-10), two existing artificialreefs (Escambia andplusmin;15 site and the ``Russian Freighter'' or San Pablosite) and one permitted reef are located within Site B, while one existingreef (``bridge rubble'' reef) and one proposed reef site are located inthe vicinity (east) of Site B. Two proposed reef sites are located withinSite C while one existing reef (Escambia andplusmin;7 site), one permittedreef, and four proposed reef sites are located in the vicinity (east) ofSite C. One proposed reef site is located northwest of Site C and westof Site B and one proposed reef is located northwest of Site B. Of these,impacts to the existing and permitted reefs are of concern to EPA. Becausethe proposed reefs are not constructed and can conceivably be moved tonearby sites as necessary (numerous proposed sites exist in the area),proposed reefs are of minimal concern. Based on telephone discussions with and a letter dated January 16, 1989,from the Escambia County Florida Marine Recreation Committee (MRC), EPAunderstands that ``thousands'' of private artificial reefs have been constructedin the area; five are known to be located within Site B and four withinSite C and others may also exist within the sites. These private reefscan be substantial structures (e.g., airplane body), but are generallyconstructed of non-permanent materials (wood and metal) and are uncharted.The MRC indicated that ``little'' original material remained at the fourreefs within Site C. EPA believes that while private reefs would providehabitat and could or would be impacted if present at selected Site C, suchprivate reefs constitute illegal ocean dumping (i.e., were not grantedappropriate permits). Such reefs were not considered in the impact analysisof the EIS or in the Proposed or Final Rules. Information regarding the one permitted reef located within Site B andthe one located east of Site C is unclear. It is possible that these sitesare the same as the existing Escambia andplusmin;7 and andplusmin;15 reefssince the permitted reefs are proximal to either Escambia andplusmin;7 orandplusmin;15. If not, EPA assumes that they are or will be constructed sincethey would have been granted permits and expects their level of use tobe similar to that of the Escambia andplusmin;7 and andplusmin;15 reefs. TheEIS and this Final Rule treat the existing and permitted sites as separatesites.The quantification of the magnitude of the artificial reef fisheries interms of participation, economic impact, and catch, as requested by thecommenter, would be difficult to compile. It is probably also unlikelythat such quantified information is documented, since records of sportscatches are generally uncommon. However, EPA believes information on theuse and economic value of local artificial reefs is helpful in impact assessment.Based primarily on telephone discussions with and a letter dated January16, 1989, from Escambia County (MRC), the Escambia andplusmin;7 and andplusmin;15reefs were recently constructed in 1987 and 1988 and contain a considerableamount of structure (car bodies, concrete material and/or a steel boathull). Considerable additional material will also be deployed at thesereefs and more is planned. The ``bridge rubble'' reef was constructed withbridge rubble in the 1970's and therefore is well established. The SanPablo reef, which consists of a Russian freighter (approx. 150 ft. long)that was sunk in 1943, has existed even longer and is the largest reefin the area. MRC reported 29 boats anchored at the San Pablo reef one summerSaturday on a holiday weekend in 1988. Also, MRC estimated that a minimumof 30% of the 19,000 registered pleasure motorboats in Escambia Countyutilize Escambia andplusmin;7 and andplusmin;15 and other artificial and naturalstructures. All four reefs are heavily fished, with grouper, snapper, triggerfishand other species being caught (also see Section 4.11 of FEIS). Principallyhook-and-line but also spearfishing methods are used. Pleasure diving,particularly at the San Pablo reef, is also pursued. (For details on reefuse, also see the subsequent summary of the MRC letter.) Based on the above information, EPA believes that the four existing reefsin proximity to Sites B and C attract sports fish, are heavily fished andotherwise used for recreation, and are economically important. This isapparently particularly true for the older San Pablo and ``bridge rubble''reefs. If the two permitted reefs in the area are different from Escambiaandplusmin;7 and andplusmin;15 and are constructed, it is assumed that theytoo are similarly used.andbullet; <T3>Concern 2: </T3>With regard to the completeness and accuracy of Section5.09, EPA believes that, relative to recreational fisheries, Section 5.09clearly indicates the existence of artificial reefs in Site B and that``[u]se of the eastern side of alternative Site B as an ODMDS would impactthe existing and permitted artificial reefs.'' The presence of these reefswas a major factor in the rejection of Site B over Site C as the selectedODMDS area. The EIS provides a reasonable basis for this decision. Theartificial reef use information supplied herein in response to the SportFishing Institute's letter supports the selection of Site C since the SanPablo reef is heavily used and would have been impacted if the easternportion of Site B would have been used. Relative to Site C and impactson artificial reefs, the one existing and one permitted reef located tothe east of Site C both lie upcurrent of the predominant currents whichflow toward the west and therefore will not be impacted significantly bythe action. EPA does not agree that the FEIS should be rejected.andbullet; <T3>Concern 2a: </T3>The paragraph in Section 5.09 is accurate and doesnot ignore the fact of possible impacts due to lost habitat. Fish, dueto their motile nature, are not directly affected by the discharge, i.e.,they are not smothered by the material being discharged. However, as indicatedin Section 5.09, indirect impacts do accrue to the fishery of the areathrough the loss of benthic organisms which serve as a food source formany demersal species. These impacts, however, are not significant becausethey would be restricted to the actual disposal area and studies have shownthat the benthos are able to recolonize dredged material disposal areaswithin 6 to 18 months following the disturbance (see Section 5.21). Asdiscussed in Section 5.03, no impact to breeding, spawning, or migratoryareas is expected to result from the proposed action due to the locationof the proposed ODMDS in relation to these areas.andbullet; <T3>Concern 2b: </T3>The commenter's concern that the use of Site B wouldaffect three artificial reefs (presumably the two existing reefs and onepermitted reef within Site B) is shared by EPA. As indicated above, thiswas one factor that led to the selection of Site C over Site B. However,despite the fisheries importance of the artificial reefs in proximity toSite C, EPA believes that the one existing and one permitted reef eastof selected Site C should not be impacted significantly since they arenot only located outside of Site C boundaries, they are also located upcurrentof Site C relative to the predominant current direction. Oceanographic investigation of the proposed sites was conducted betweenFebruary 1987 and January 1988. The results of these investigations indicatedthat the currents in this area of the Gulf of Mexico are wind driven, parallelto shore, and typically uniform throughout the water column. Although thepredominant current direction is towards the west, there are instanceswhen flows are towards the northeast and east. During the site designationprocess, the possible impact of dredged material being moved by the currentswas investigated utilizing numerical models. As a result of these models,a management plan was devised for the site to provide additional bufferbetween significant resources and the ODMDS. Appendices H and I to theFEIS contain the numerical modeling effort and management plan, respectively,and should be consulted for details. The results of the numerical modelindicate that although the fine-grained material stays in suspension afterdisposal, the concentration of the material decreases significantly withdistance from the disposal site. The distance between the existing Escambiaandplusmin;7 reef and the ODMDS is approximately 2 miles (approximately 3miles for the permitted reef) and it is unlikely that concentrations ofsuspended material of sufficient quantity to result in impacts to thisreef would ever travel this distance. As added protection, the managementof the site involves the proposed construction of a horseshoe-shaped berminto which the fine-grained dredged material would be disposed. This bermis closed on the eastern end; therefore, any suspended or eroded materialwould have to move up the berm, approximately 6 feet in height, beforemoving toward the artificial reefs. Since impacts to these resources wouldnot be significant, discussion on mitigation of impacts is not appropriate.Since Site B was not selected, discussion of mitigation of impacts to theartificial reefs within Site B is also not appropriate. With respect to the commenter's conclusion that ``* * * the FEIS is inadequateand fails to address fisheries in any meaningful way,'' EPA does not agreethat the FEIS is ``inadequate,'' pursuant to the EIS rating system criteriapresented in the ``Policy and Procedures For the Review of Federal ActionsImpacting the Environment'' currently used by EPA. Fisheries-related informationpresented in the FEIS supports the selection of Site C over Site B. TheEIS provides a reasonable basis for this decision. The reef use informationsupplied herein, further supports this selection. Also with regard to fisheries, EPA wishes to note that the Proposed Ruleshould have included a discussion on potential impacts to artificial reefsassociated with Site C under criteria andplusmin;8, concerned with fishingand recreation, in the discussion of the 11 specific site selection criteriacharacterizing Site C. However, such discussion was presented earlier undercriteria andplusmin;3 concerned with amenities. Related to the above Sport Fishing Institute's letter was a letter receivedfrom the Escambia County Florida, Marine Recreation Committee (MRC). Aspreviously mentioned, EPA telephone requested information from MRC, primarilyconcerning the use of artificial reefs associated with Sites B and C. Asa follow-up, MRC provided a letter dated January 16, 1989, discussing artificialreef use and other comments/concerns. The MRC cover letter referenced the conversation with EPA on January 10,1989, receipt and review of the provided FEIS, and indicated that commentswere ``* * * directed at the ODMDS potential impact on recreational fishing,sports diving and artificial fishing reefs in this area.'' The commenteralso indicated that the MRC was an advisory body to the Escambia CountyBoard of County Commissioners and that it was composed of recreationalfishermen, charter boat captains, and sports divers. As such, it representedthe opinions of the local recreational fishing and diving industry. The MRC comments attached to the cover letter discussed three main topics:(1) Review of the FEIS, (2) existing and proposed artificial reefs, and(3) the effect of ODMDS Sites B and C on recreational fishing, sports divingand artificial reef sites of Escambia County. Regarding the MRC review of the FEIS, the commenter indicated that thiswas the initial review opportunity provided to MRC for the DEIS or FEIS.An MRC letter dated March 26, 1987, to the Mobile COE expressing MRC viewswas referenced. The commenter indicated that MRC in principal opposes theestablishment of ODMDSs or other ocean disposal ``* * * due to negativeeffects which this activity has traditionally had upon marine life andrecreational fishing.'' However, the commenter recognized the complex natureof the U.S. Navy Strategic Homeport Project and the effect of economicson the selection of disposal methods and site locations. It was indicatedthat it was understood that it was not a matter if an ODMDS would be approved,but rather where it would be located. The MRC indicated, based on the FEISreview, that Site C ``* * * will have the least negative impact * * *''on the local artificial fishing reef program and on recreational fishing.The commenter also referenced that MRC comments were made per EPA request. Relative to existing and artificial reefs, the commenter indicated thatlocal charter boats ``rely heavily'' on artificial structure since thepresence of natural structure in the area was limited within a feasibledistance of Pensacola Pass (considered to be less than 35 miles and usuallyless than 20 miles). Very few large structures exist. Significant naturalstructures were listed as ledges and rock outcroppings generally more than20 miles from the Pensacola Pass. Fishes of recreational interest dwellingor visiting at structures were snapper, grouper, triggerfish, amberjack,mackerel and cobia. The commenter also indicated that ``thousands'' of private, non-permittedreefs existed within the 35-mile arc of the Pass. Four such reefs wereknown to be located within Site C (3 east of the western edge of the safetyfairway and 1 on the extreme western side of Site C). The commenter statedthat ``[l]ittle of the original material, automobile bodies, a wooden shrimpboat and an airplane, remains.'' Site B was indicated as containing fiveknown private reefs (3 in the southeastern portion and 2 in the southwesternend). Structures were comprised of two airplanes, two barges and automobilebodies. The commenter stated that private reef builders ``* * * recognizethe disadvantages of their efforts due to the effects of hurricanes anddiscovery by other fishermen'' and that generally inexpensive and relativelyshort-lived materials were used. It was felt that other private reefs inaddition to the nine mentioned may also be located within Sites B and C. The commenter provided a history of Escambia County's artificial reefprogram which was established in 1985 and was preceded by a former countyprogram (until 1979) and the State's deployment of liberty ships. The formerCounty program concentrated on automobile tires and concrete rubble materialwhile the present program centered on donated material and designed structure.Escambia Sites andplusmin;7 and andplusmin;15 were scheduled to receive about$100,000 worth of designed structure in 1989 and some $120,000 had beenrequested for the future. Escambia County was one of few communities witha program using designed structure. The present program identified 22 potentialpublic reef sites of which eight were permitted. Existing permitted reefsin the vicinity of Sites B and C were known as Escambia County andplusmin;7and andplusmin;15, which were two square mile plots each. These sites werelocated per COE and the Florida Department of Natural Resources (DNR) requirementsand other factors. The COE and DNR requirements were described as ``a sandybottom with no natural growth or other significant habitat,'' which aresimilar to criteria for siting ODMDSs. Only reef sites andplusmin;7 and andplusmin;15of the eight permitted sites have received material; they were definedas the ``cornerstones'' of the Escambia County reef program for developmentof mid-depth sites (70-100 ft.). Deployment of material occurred in alternate500 x 500-foot squares composing the sites. The commenter indicated that Figure 4-2 of the FEIS depicted permittedand proposed Escambia County public artificial reefs relative to SitesB and C. It was stated that ``[w]e commend the EPA in not recommendingODMDS site B due to its potentially negative effect on existing and proposedartificial fishing reef sites.'' Escambia andplusmin;7, east of Site C, iscomposed of 200 tons of concrete structure and 30 automobile bodies deployedin 1987 and 1988. Escambia andplusmin;15, within the southeast end of SiteB, contains 24 automobile bodies and a 40-foot steel hull boat deployedin 1988. Within the next 30 days, the commenter indicated that 100 largeconcrete culverts and 14 steel pipes would be deployed and 16 railroadbox cars were scheduled for deployment in the next six months. Plans foradditional deployment were in various stages; a majority of the $100,000worth of designed materials for deployment at these sites was scheduledfor 1989. The commenter felt that these two sites currently contained 30%of the volume of artificial reef material in the area, which would increaseto 60% by the end of 1989.Specific to reef use information, the commenter provided the following(excerpted):<ITAG tagnum="21">``As with any publicly identified artificial reef structure, sites7 and 15 are heavily used by recreational fishermen due to the lack ofnatural and artificial bottom structure. Their use will significantly increaseas additional material is deployed and the public experiences successfulfishing trips at these sites. During peak recreational fishing periodssuch as summer holiday weekends, we have frequently observed numerous recreationalfishing and dive boats anchored over the same public reef structure. Onone summer Saturday in 1988, 29 boats were observed anchored at the sametime on one structure, the San Pueblo [San Pablo]. The San Pueblo [SanPablo] or Russian Freighter, has been in place since 1943 and is locatedeast of Escambia County site 15 on the eastern boundary of site B. Thesame day, every publicly known site to include sites 7 and 15, had 5 ormore boats on them. We estimate that at a minimum 30 percent of EscambiaCounty's 19,000 registered pleasure motor boats use sites 7 and 15, otherpublic artificial reefs and well known natural structures. Private andcharter fishing and dive boats from Pensacola, Destin, and Orange Beach,AL also use public reef structures off Pensacola and have frequently beenobserved on sites 7 and 15. Approximately 20 percent of the charter fishingboats use public sites. Virtually 100 percent of the areas dive shops usepublic reef sites. Sites 7 and 15 are designed by the placement of materialin alternate squares, to accommodate a large number of recreational boaterson a non competition basis, while at the same time increasing the probabilityof creating an artificial reef habitat that will encourage and supporta total increase in fish biomass. These sites are unique in their sizeand design as a majority of the older public reef sites consist of smallerphysical areas and significantly less reef material.''</ITAG>The commenter stated that MRC members ``* * * must rely upon the EPA, DNR,and other agencies * * *'' for the expertise to address the total effectof creating an ODMDS in the area. Several concerns were raised regarding ODMDS impacts on the artificialreefs. These involved the effect of depositing dredged material containingheavy metals or other unsuitable constituents at the ODMDS and that 19square miles of bottom area would be eliminated for potential habitat improvement(reefs). MRC was also concerned that materials might migrate from the ODMDS.MRC also did not believe that the FEIS monitoring and management plansfully provided methods to monitor such migration or ``* * * actions whichcan or will be taken to correct or eliminate any discovered movement.''It was recommended that the monitoring plan ``* * * should at a minimumencompass detailed monitoring during the construction process, an annualevaluation during the first five years after construction and evaluationsafter any hurricane whose eye transits within 100 miles of this area.''If the material was demonstrated to be stable, monitoring intervals couldbe significantly decreased. It was also felt that subsequent disposal by``private'' dredging activities may not be properly monitored. It was feltthat a commitment for long-term funding to correct any problems was notaddressed and may not be possible for government budgets. The source offunding for possible capping of the disposed material, if it was determinedto migrate, was also questioned. The commenter noted that ``[i]f, ODMDS site C is created with a horseshoeberm and material is placed and monitored as described above and in theEIS, we do not believe their [there] will be a significant adverse effectupon reef sites 7 and 15, beyond anticipated turbidity problems duringthe initial deployment.'' If material movement or placement was not aspredicted, however, it was stated that ``* * * there is the possibilityfor significant adverse effects on these two and other reef sites.'' Alteration of Escambia County's artificial reef construction program wassaid to be dictated by creation of the ODMDS at Site C. Sites andplusmin;3and andplusmin;4 would need to be abandoned (since they were downcurrentof the open portion of the horseshoe berm and could potentially be influencedby material movement). Plans for Site andplusmin;2 may also be abandoned,depending on material movement. The potential use of Site andplusmin;2 wouldbe, at a minimum, delayed for three years until effects of the ODMDS weredetermined. Development of Site andplusmin;1 was already reduced and wouldlikely not occur due to turbidity from nearshore dredging projects existingnorth and west of the safety fairway intersection. Regarding Site B, thecommenter indicated that proposed sites andplusmin;1 through andplusmin;4 werethe only large reef sites west of the north-south safety fairway. It wasfelt that selection of Site B would have had a significant and adverseeffect on recreational fishing since ``* * * it would have caused our completeabandonment of reef site 15, a significant deterioration of the San Pueblo[San Pablo] site, and the probable abandonment of plans to develop sites1, 2 and 3.'' In response to the MRC letter, the following is offered: andbullet; <T3>Topic 1: </T3>Regarding the review of the FEIS, the commenter indicatedthat this was the ``initial opportunity'' to review the FEIS or DEIS. Wewish to note, however, that page 7-3 of the DEIS and FEIS indicate thatthe Escambia County Commission was on the EIS coordination list. EPA primarily requested use information on Escambia County artificial reefsassociated with Sites B and C. As a follow-up to this telephone discussion,a copy of the FEIS (with a question as to the source of the two permittedreefs in Figure 4-2 on page 4-10) and the Proposed Rule were provided.Although a letter was not necessarily requested, MRC provided the letterdated January 16, 1989. EPA appreciates MRC's documentation of the artificialreef information. andbullet; <T3>Topic 2: </T3>Thank you for providing information on the existing andproposed Escambia County artificial reefs associated with Sites B and C.EPA wishes to emphasize that the referenced private, non-permitted reefsconstitute illegal ocean dumping.andbullet; <T3>Topic 3: </T3>Several concerns were presented by the MRC: <ITAG tagnum="15">_Pertaining to the presence of heavy metals and other unsuitable constituentsin the disposal material, materials may not be approved for ocean disposalunless the criteria in the Ocean Dumping Regulations, 40 CFR Part 227,have been met. Bioassay toxicity tests of the material anticipated forinitial disposal at the ODMDS (from the Navy's homeporting project at Pensacola)indicate no significant adverse effects to marine organisms (see FEIS AppendixD). Although slight heavy metal enrichment of chromium, mercury, and zincexists, the levels are not high enough to initiate the capping of the disposeddredged material with clean sand or to prevent the proposed designationof this ODMDS (see FEIS Section 5.05). Any future disposal of dredged materialat this site would require similar testing before disposal. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_EPA agrees that the ocean bottom area within the boundaries of theODMDS would be lost for habitat improvement for the Escambia County artificialreef program. However, the proposed ODMDS horseshoe-shaped containmentberm and clay clumps could attract reef-associated fishes. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Regarding the monitoring and management plans proposed in the EIS,we believe them to be adequate proposals at this time. Modifications ofthese plans are possible as greater understanding of the site develops.In general, disposed material will be monitored via a sediment mappingtechnique. If evidence of significant adverse environmental effects outsidethe ODMDS boundaries is discovered, EPA will take appropriate measuresto mitigate the impact or terminate disposal at the site. It should alsobe noted that the proposed horseshoe-shaped berm at the eastern end ofthe ODMDS should help contain the fine-grained disposal material withinthe ODMDS. This berm, in association with a natural upward slope at thewestern end of the ODMDS, will form a trough containment area. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_In regard to ODMDS monitoring frequency, this will depend upon need(determined dredged material migration outside the ODMDS) and funding.Funding sources include EPA, COE, and private operators with disposal needs.Funding is via an annual budget and is therefore undetermined for eachfollowing year. In general, the existence, magnitude, and implementationof the management and monitoring plans for this site are dependent uponfunding, monitoring data results and coordination between EPA, the COE,U.S. Navy, State of Florida and/or other potential users. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_In general, turbidity problems during disposal should not be significantto Escambia andplusmin;7 and andplusmin;15 reefs since the predominant currentdirection is to the west away from the reefs and toward the ODMDS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The abandonment of proposed reef sites by Escambia County shouldbe dependent upon site locations in relation to the ODMDS, current directions,and monitoring data results. We assume that there are numerous new sitesin the general area that could be used as necessary for artificial reefdeployment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The FEIS (Appendices G and I) and the Proposed Rule should be consultedfor additional information on the proposed management and monitoring plansand the Pensacola (offshore) ODMDS designation in general. </ITAG>Comments from the Mote Marine Laboratory complimented the FEIS's ``presentationand history of site selection'' as being ``quite excellent.'' Three mainconcerns were provided: (1) Use of the words ``temporary'' and ``localized''(pp. 1-2) was questioned relative to dredged material impacts; while ``localized''could be interpreted to mean the ``disposal site,'' it was suggested thatthe word ``temporary'' be better defined; (2) it was unclear if the modelused in the ``Circulation and Mixing and Sediment Transport'' section (FEIS:pp. 4-2 and 4-3) accounted for any wave surge, which can affect sheer forcesand resuspension of fines; <T3>in situ </T3>measurement of resuspension was felt to be technologicallypossible although probably unprecedented at a disposal site; measurementwould be useful to refine and verify models predicting sediment transport;(3) the commenter felt that fine particulates disposed on sites consistingof ``* * *  coarse and medium sand with varying amounts of shell fragments''(FEIS: pg. 4-4) will not remain there (i.e., will be re-exposed) due tohydrodynamic forces; the author did not totally agree with ``[t]he hypothesisthat coarser materials will armor the surface and prevent further winnowingof fine particulates * * *'' due to bioturbation effects (sediment mixingof macroinfauna), which would expose fines to surge and currents; movingsediments (as evidenced by sand waves and indicating instability and sedimentmovement) would also re-expose fine particulates to currents. The commenter also indicated that ``* * * the EPA monitoring program shouldconsider a long term strategy at these sites in order to accurately definesediment transport dynamics.'' The magnitude and extent of sediment movementcould thereby be resolved and its importance determined. In response to the three main concerns from Mote Marine Laboratory, thefollowing is offered: andbullet; <T3>Concern 1: </T3>The terms ``localized'' and ``temporary'' are moreclearly defined in Section 5 of the FEIS. ``Localized'' is used to meanthe area of the ODMDS. The term ``temporary'' may denote varying time framesdepending on whether one is discussing the impacts to the water columnor benthos. The former may refer to a matter of minutes or hours whilethe latter may range from weeks to months. andbullet; <T3>Concern 2: </T3>Relative to the DIFID Model accounting for wave surgeaffecting sediment resuspension and sheer forces, FEIS Appendix B containsa summary of the physical oceanographic data collected at Sites B and Cas part of the field investigations on these sites. This information wasthen utilized as input to two models to project conditions under differingmeteorological conditions as described in Section 3 of Appendix B. AppendixH presents a discussion of the DIFID Model utilized in the projection ofthe response of the material discharge from the disposal vessel. As indicatedin this discussion, the major limitation of DIFID is the assumption thatonce solid particles are deposited on the bottom, they remain there. Asindicated in Sections 4.08 and 5.07, resuspension of deposited material,especially fine sands and silts and clay, can be expected to occur underconditions measured at the site. The movement of these materials, however,is not expected to result in unacceptable impacts due to the location ofthe proposed ODMDS in relation to significant resources. It is agreed that information relative to transport and resuspension ofmaterials deposited in the ODMDS is needed. A collection of relevant informationhas been included in the proposed Site Monitoring Plan discussed in AppendixG of the FEIS. andbullet; <T3>Concern 3: </T3>Regarding bioturbation, EPA agrees that it is an importantaspect in the sedimentary processes of an area. As indicated in Section5.07, much of the silt and clay deposited in the area is expected to bewinnowed from the site by ambient currents. The material initially to bedischarged into the site consists of approximately 3 mcy of sandy or cohesivematerial. This cohesive material is expected to form clumps of ``clay balls''which tend to consolidate over time. The remaining 1.1 mcy is approximately40% sand and 60% silt/clay. Of this 60% silt/clay, approximately 50% isexpected to form clumps. The proposed management plan for the use of thesite (Appendix I) would utilize the three million cubic yards to form athree-sided underwater berm. The remaining material would then be dischargedwithin this berm area. It is expected that much of the non-cohesive, fine-grainedmaterial will erode from the site over time. Based on COE experience, minimialerosion of the cohesive fine-grained material is expected. Concerning the commenter's interest in ``a long term strategy'' at thesite relative to sediment transport dynamics, the proposed site monitoringplan as described in Appendix G contains components associated with measuringsediment transport away from the ODMDS. The temporal extent of the monitoringprogram is dependent, however, on the level of impacts associated withthe action and does not represent a scientific investigation into sedimenttransport processes.The review letter from the Florida Department of State, Division of HistoricalResources, provided comments and included a copy of the Division's previousletter dated March 16, 1988, to the U.S. Navy concerning the ``[c]ulturalresource assessment request for proposed dredge disposal from PensacolaHarbor Homeporting'' (a copy of that letter was included in the FEIS (pg.7-7 and 7-8) and is not completely summarized herein; however, see summaryof the Division's present letter below and responses to the U.S. Departmentof the Interior's comment letter on the Proposed Rule at the end of thisSection B). The commenter referenced Section 4.16, ``Cultural Resources,''of the FEIS as indicating that a literature search determined no historicshipwrecks near the alternative ODMDS, and that Section 7.0 indicated thatresults were coordinated with the Florida State Historic Preservation Officer.The enclosed March 16 letter was described as addressing two issues: 1)Unless inbank disposal of clean sand is used, ``* * * the remains of Ft.McRae and shipwrecks on the west bank of the entrance channel * * *'' wouldbe adversely impacted by the proposed dredging and 2) disposal of spoilon the ``* * * several known potentially significant shipwrecks * * *''in the ODMDS area, ``* * *  would not affect the qualities which wouldmake them eligible for listing in the <T3>National Register of Historic Places.</T3>'' As stated in the letter,it was concluded in the March 16 letter that in the Division's opinion,there would be no effects to any ``* * * properties listed, or eligiblefor listing, on the <T3>National Register of Historic Places,</T3>'' if clean ocean sand (dredgedmaterial) is used for beach nourishment at the Pensacola entrance channel(west bank). The main point of the Historical Resources comment letterwas that the commenter felt that despite the enclosure of the Division'scomments in the FEIS, ``* * * there is no evidence that they have beentaken into account * * *'' in the FEIS. It was, therefore, unclear if cleansand would or would not be used for inbank disposal. Without such disposal,the commenter felt that the eligible <T3>National Register </T3>properties would be adversely affected. After receiving the above comment letter, EPA received a follow-up letterfrom the Florida Division of Historical Resources dated December 20, 1988.This letter indicated that additional information had been provided bythe COE (Mobile District) which addressed the Division's concerns. Basedon this additional information, the letter indicated that ``* * * it isthe opinion of this agency that the above referenced project will haveno effect on any sites listed, or eligible for listing, in the <T3>National Register of Historic Places, </T3>or otherwise of national,state, or local significance'' and that ``[t]he project may proceed withoutfurther involvement with this agency.'' EPA wishes to note that the letters from the Division commented primarilyon the U.S. Navy homeporting project at Pensacola rather than the ODMDSdesignation process per se, although the designation FEIS is referencedin the two recent review letters to EPA. While it is anticipated that certaindredged material from this project is to be disposed at the Pensacola (offshore)ODMDS, this and other dredging projects proposing to use the ODMDS aftersite designation are related to but <T3>separate </T3>from the present site designation rulemaking process.EPA wishes to emphasize that site designation, by itself, does not authorizeany dredging project or on-site disposal of dredged material. Also, thePensacola (offshore) ODMDS is restricted to fine-grained material whichis not suitable for beach nourishment. The Board of County Commissioners (Escambia County, FL) also commented.Comments were both on site designation and the proposed Navy homeportingproject and presented Board conclusions rather than a critique of the FEIS.In the cover letter, the commenter indicated that ``[t]he Board stronglyurges favorable consideration of Site C as the best suited for use as anOcean Dredged Material Disposal site for disposal of the 4.1 million cubicyards of dredged material * * *'' from the homeporting project. The commentsattached to the cover letter summarized the anticipated Navy homeportingproject at Pensacola where 5 mcy of dredged material are proposed for beachnourishment and 4.1 mcy are proposed for disposal at the ODMDS. Four mainpoints were listed: (1) The designation of an ODMDS involved considerationof several alternatives, including the no-action and non-ocean alternativeswhich were not acceptable (presumably per the FEIS); the COE had determined``* * * that ocean disposal is the most feasible method at the presenttime'' (COE references were cited), which was felt to be partly relatedto the general non-availability of land disposal sites and increased costs;it was stated that ``[i]t is felt however, that given the availabilityof land based disposal site(s), disposal of dredged material should beevaluated in terms of EPA's criteria (40 CFR 227.15) for site suitabilitybased on availability and environmental acceptability;''(2) dredged materialcompatible with beach nourishment should be deposited further landward(further than natural processes would provide along the shoreline) to stabilizethe dune system; maintenance dredging material could be deposited alongthe shoreline to further stabilize dunes and promote vegetation; (3) alternativeSite C was felt to apparently be the best suited for ODMDS designationin terms of compliance with Federal, State and local statutes and policiesregarding ODMDS designation, water depth, distance from shore, relationto beaches, artificial reefs, fish havens, hard bottom areas, other criteriain 40 CFR 228.6, and the fact that it is within an economically transportabledistance; and (4) construction of a submerged containment area for disposednon-cohesive material was recommended using 93% of the dredged material(sand or silt/clay clumps); the site's size and depth should be designedto minimize potential impacts to areas outside the site. EPA is pleased that the Board approves of Site C as the location for theODMDS. The following clarification is offered on the Board's four comments:andbullet; <T3>Comment 1: </T3>Regarding alternatives, the FEIS prepared by the U.S.Navy for the Gulf Coast Strategic, Homeporting project investigated a numberof alternatives, including land-based disposal. This FEIS filed with EPAin January 1987, and incorporated into this site designation EIS by reference,concluded that ocean disposal was the only acceptable alternative for thedisposal of fine-grained material to be dredged as part of the homeportingactivity at Pensacola. Alternatives in the site designation EIS were intendedto be generally limited to the evaluation of ocean action alternativesand the no-action alternative. EPA believes that the non-ocean alternativesshould be addressed in project-specific documentation.andbullet; <T3>Comment 2: </T3>It was suggested that maintenance material could beused for beach nourishment of the shoreline to stabilize the dune system.EPA wishes to emphasize that beach nourishment is another option alternativefor dredged material disposal (i.e., is different from ocean disposal)and as such is separate from the site designation process, which by itselfdoes not authorize dredging projects or ocean disposal at the ODMDS. andbullet; <T3>Comment 3: </T3>EPA wishes to emphasize that Site C is not being designatedin its entirety, but rather only approximately six square statute milesthereof will be designated as an ODMDS. andbullet; <T3>Comment 4: </T3>Your comments on the proposed ODMDS submerged containmentberm are appreciated. The State of Florida, Office of the Governor, provided generally complimentarycomments. Comment letters from the Florida Department of Natural Resources(FDNR) and the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation (FDER) wereattached to a summary cover letter from the Office of the Governor. Inthe cover letter, the State indicated that their concerns on the site boundaries,nature of site disposal material, and a detailed site monitoring and managementplan relative to the site designation process had been resolved throughmodel studies, coordination with EPA, COE, and the Navy, and conveyed throughFEIS revisions. The State, therefore, concurred with EPA's determinationthat the designation of the ODMDS is consistent to the maximum extent practicablewith the Florida Coastal Management Program (FCMP). The State was ``* ** particularly pleased with the application of the dispersion model inselecting final site boundaries and in determining the monitoring and sitemanagement protocol.'' The State indicated that they expected the sitemanagement and monitoring plans to be incorporated specifically or by referencein the published rule. It was further indicated that monitoring resultscould evaluate the dispersion modeling and management plan. Mention ofcontinued consultation with EPA and the COE regarding monitoring resultsand changes in the management plan was also made. Appreciation for earlycoordination and a recommendation to use the coordination process for thePensacola (offshore) ODMDS as a model for future Florida ODMDS designationswas also included. The attached letter from the FDNR noted that if modification of the proposedsite should involve use of State waters for disposal of dredged material,designation would require State easements. It was also noted per the FEISthat the Pensacola (offshore) ODMDS was not for disposal of beach compatibledredged material or for material appropriate for the Pensacola (nearshore)ODMDS, and that coordination with the COE and the Navy regarding beach-qualitydredged material was welcomed. The attached FDER letter presented most of the comments conveyed in thecover letter summarized above. In addition, tracking the success of theunderwater berm construction was mentioned. In response to the State of Florida Office of the Governor letter and itsattached FDNR and FDER letters, EPA appreciates the State's concurrencein the designation of the Pensacola (offshore) ODMDS within Site C to receivefine-grained dredged material not suitable for beach nourishment or fordisposal at the Pensacola (nearshore) ODMDS from the greater Pensacola,Florida area. We also note the State's concurrence in EPA's consistencydetermination with the Florida Coastal Management Program. EPA and theCOE appreciate the efforts of the State, especially the Office of the Governor,Office of Planning and Budgeting, and the Florida Departments of EnvironmentalRegulation and Natural Resources. EPA and the COE will continue to coordinateefforts at the Pensacola (offshore) ODMDS, especially the management andmonitoring activities, with these agencies. The proposed monitoring and management plans are presented in AppendicesG and I, respectively, in the FEIS. These two plans were referenced inSection G (``Site Management'') of the Proposed Rule (pg. 50981) and inthis Final Rule. The Pensacola (offshore) ODMDS boundaries are <T3>outside </T3>Florida State waters. Relative to the need for State easements(FDNR letter), EPA does not believe that the ODMDS designation processrequires State easements when proposed ODMDSs are outside or inside Floridawaters. One comment letter on the Proposed Rule was received by EPA from the U.S.Department of the Interior (DOI; Office of Environmental Project Review:Washington, DC). This letter was dated January 13, 1989, and presentedtwo concerns. Also, a follow-up letter to the DOI letter was requestedby EPA and received from the Minerals Management Service (MMS; Gulf ofMexico OCS Region: New Orleans (Metairie), LA) within DOI shortly afterthe Proposed Rule comment period (letter dated January 31, 1989). EPA subsequentlyrequested and received written comments dated February 3, 1989 from theCOE (Mobile District) and provided a letter to DOI dated February 6, 1989,attaching the COE letter and requesting a DOI follow-up letter to EPA.The requested second DOI letter was dated February 24, 1989. The first concern in the initial January 13 DOI letter discussed the presenceof two lease blocks in the area of the ODMDS. DOI indicated that ``[i]tis likely that the area proposed for ODMDS designation will be leased byInterior for oil and gas exploration and development.'' It was indicatedthat two blocks (846 and 847) were offered in November 1988, that bidshad been received for both, and that ``* * * leases may be awarded in thevery near future.'' The portion of the site that includes block 847 ``** * should not affect exploration because it lies directly beneath an existingshipping fairway.'' Regarding block 846, the commenter indicated that 90%of the site was located on block 846 and 50% lies on the fairway. It wasstated that ``[i]f the proposed site is designated, its use should be controlledin a manner that ensures ocean dumping activities will not interfere withoil and gas exploration or development activities conducted on these blocks.''The second DOI concern involved potential archaeological resources. Thecommenter stated that ``[t]he site selected for the ODMDS lies in an areathat may contain undiscovered archaeological resources.'' It was indicatedthat no surveys had been conducted to determine if such resources werepresent and that ``* * * the vast majority of prehistoric archaeologicalsites found on the Gulf of Mexico outer continental shelf occur off theFlorida coast.'' The commenter also stated that ``EPA should ensure thatthe site is surveyed prior to designation in order to determine whetherarchaeological resources may be affected by ocean dumping activities.''With regard to the DOI-requested archaeological survey, the Mobile DistrictCOE conducted underwater cultural resources investigations for the U.S.Navy Gulf Coast Strategic Homeporting effort at Pensacola, Florida in 1986-1987.When the need to develop an ODMDS offshore Pensacola was identified, thisactivity was coordinated by the COE with the Florida State Historic PreservationOfficer (SHPO). In a previously-referenced letter (see responses to FEIScomments) dated March 16, 1988 (see FEIS, pg. 7-7), from the Florida Departmentof State (Division of Historical Resources: Tallahassee, FL) to the U.S.Navy, it was stated with regard to open water coordinates inclusive ofthe ODMDS, that (excerpted):<ITAG tagnum="21"> With respect to the disposal of other dredge materials within theabove cited open water coordinates, then even though we have identifiedpotentially significant historic shipwrecks within that area (as well asseveral non-historic shipwrecks and artificial fish reefs important tothe local fishing economy), we would have to conclude that its use as adredge disposal site would not affect the qualities which make such shipwreckseligible for listing in the National Register. Thus, if the clean sandis used for beach nourishment, it is the opinion of this agency that theproposed offshore dredge disposal will have no effect on any propertieslisted, or eligible for listing, in<T3> The National Register of Historic Places.</T3></ITAG> It can also be stated that the present site designation process does not,by itself, authorize any dredging projects or disposal at the ODMDS. Furthermore,use of the ODMDS would involve disposal, as opposed to dredging, at theODMDS so that submarine areas will not be excavated. In response to DOI's lease block concern, EPA coordinated with MMS (Gulfof Mexico OCS Region: New Orleans (Metairie), LA office) within DOI. EPA/MMStelephone discussions were held on January 26, 27, 30, and 31, 1989. Aspart of this coordination, EPA requested a follow-up letter from MMS. Byletter dated January 31, 1989, MMS stated that (excerpted):<ITAG tagnum="21"> Your Agency has requested the Department of the Interior providesome clarification of its comments concerning an ocean dredged materialsdumping site in Pensacola Blocks 846 and 847. Further, you asked aboutwhen one might expect oil and gas activities to commence on the two tracts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> Oil and gas leases for Pensacola Blocks 846 and 847 will be issuedeffective February 1, 1989. We do not believe drilling operations can commenceearlier than 8 to 10 months from this date given all the approved activitiesinvolved with tracts off the State of Florida. Our experience indicatesa more practical date would be 2 to 3 years after the date of the lease.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> Our concern with the dumping of dredged material interfering withoil and gas exploration and development activities was directed at on-sitedrilling and production structures. The proposed disposal site is relativelysmall in areal extent, and we do not foresee any adverse effects on oiland gas activities. Once a drilling rig or platform has been placed onthe lease, disposal should occur a safe distance away. This would requiresome coordination between the dredging company and the oil and gas operator.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> Accordingly, we believe the dumping of dredged material at the proposedsite and oil and gas activities can coexist on Pensacola Blocks 846 and847. If you should have further questions, please let us know.</ITAG> Based on this letter, any near-future ODMDS utilization, such as the anticipatedinitial disposal of 4.1 mcy of dredged material from the U.S. Navy's HomeportProject at Pensacola (disposal projected in Spring of 1989, pending sitedesignation), should not conflict with oil and gas exploration/developmentsince any drilling operations apparently are not imminent. However, becausethe ODMDS is designated on a permanent basis as opposed to an interim basis,EPA believes the potential for use conflicts associated with more distantfuture disposal operations exists at the ODMDS. EPA requested written comments from the COE (Mobile District) regardinguse conflicts at the ODMDS. The COE responded by letter dated February3, 1989. Included in this letter was the COE's concern about future conflictsbetween dredged material and oil and gas exploration/development activities.The COE stated that ``[t]he location of a drilling rig or platform withinthe ODMDS would preclude any meaningful monitoring of the ODMDS since itwould be virtually impossible to separate impacts caused by the two activities.''The COE also indicated that due to the small size of the ODMDS and thefine-grained nature of the dredged material, ``* * * the entire site isneeded to contain fine grained dredged material.'' In general, EPA believes that although the proposed ODMDS horseshoe-shapedcontainment berm (which is currently designed to receive disposal material)would principally be located within a safety fairway where no drillingplatform or rig structures are allowed, the potential for use conflictsexists for the remaining portion of the ODMDS. If a find is made withinthe ODMDS, directional drilling from areas adjacent to the ODMDS may bean option to drilling structure placement within the ODMDS. EPA also believesit is important to monitor the ODMDS and surrounding area in order to determineif disposal material is migrating from the site and, if so, to determineany associated impacts (see FEIS Appendices G and I for proposed monitoringand management plans, respectively). While such monitoring would stillphysically be possible if drilling structures were located in the area,EPA and the COE are concerned that drilling mud and cutting effluent fromsuch structures could, despite NPDES permitting, result in local environmentalimpacts. If so, such impacts could confound potential impacts outside theODMDS boundaries attributable to the ODMDS. EPA monitoring results couldtherefore be inconclusive. Subsequent to receipt of the COE's February 3 letter, EPA provided theCOE's comments to DOI in a letter dated February 6, 1989. In that letter,EPA stated that ``[t]he COE's letter indicates a preference to keep drillingactivities at least one mile outside the ODMDS'' and ``[f]rom a site designation,monitoring and management perspective, EPA also prefers such a limitation.''The EPA letter also requested that DOI ``* * * determine if drilling structurescan be kept outside of the ODMDS boundaries.'' EPA coordinated with DOIby telephone on February 8, 10, 16, 22, 23, and 24, 1989, prior to receiptof the requested second letter. By letter dated February 24, 1989, DOIstated the following (excerpted except for the referenced sketch): The Department of the Interior has reviewed your letter of February 6,1989, and the enclosures thereto. We have also reexamined the details concerningthe Environmental Protection Agency's rulemaking appearing at 53 FR 50977(December 19, 1988), that would designate a site offshore Pensacola, Florida,as an ocean dredged material disposal site (ODMDS). Enclosed is a sketch showing the approximate locations of the shippingsafety fairway (SSF), oil and gas leasing blocks_Pensacola Blocks 846 and847, and the outer boundary of the ODMDS. The approximate location of theplanned spoils piles within the ODMDS are indicated. The Corps of Engineershas indicated a preference that all drilling activities be kept at least1 mile outside of the ODMDS for environmental monitoring purposes but thatboth activities could coexist if drilling rigs and platforms are at leastkept outside the ODMDS.Assuming that the sketch is reasonably accurate, it is apparent that a1-mile buffer outside the ODMDS would totally preclude surface access toPensacola Block 846. If drilling units were allowed in the portion of PensacolaBlock 846 which is outside both the SSF and the ODMDS, limited explorationdrilling would be permitted. If drilling units were allowed in the westernhalf of Pensacola Block 846 with the requirement to remain clear of thespoils piles, nearly the entire block that was available at the time oiland gas lease bids were offered, i.e., excluding the SSF, would be availablefor exploratory drilling. The placement of production platforms and developmentwells is less sensitive to surface location than is the placement of exploratorywells. The location and spacing of wells necessary for exploration and developmentis controlled by 30 CFR 250.32 (1988) which requires that considerationmust be given to unreasonable interference with other uses of the OuterContinental Shelf (OCS). In addition, plans required under 30 CFR 250.33and 250.34 (1988) prior to exploration and development must include a bathymetrymap and an analysis of seafloor and subsurface geologic and manmade hazards.Therefore, it is not necessary to constrain oil and gas lease activityvia a specific prohibition in the lease agreement pertaining to placementof drilling units and/or platforms. To further encumber a lease on PensacolaBlock 846 now could result in the bidder rejecting the lease offer. Our experience indicates that not all oil and gas leases are explored bydrilling. Furthermore, the average time lapse between lease issuance andexploratory drilling is 2-3 years. The drilling of exploratory wells willrarely consume 6 months even for the deepest wells. When an oil or gasdiscovery has been made in a relatively remote area such as Pensacola Block846, another average 3-5 years will pass before the lease can be developedand placed on production. In view of the time spans involved, it is veryunlikely that a conflict would arise between oil and gas activities anddumping activities. If a plan of exploration is received identifying thesurface location of a proposed well or wells, we are confident that accommodationcan be reached between these competing uses in the event they occur inthe same time period. We are also confident that if it is possible to controldumping discharges sufficiently to avoid moving ships in the SSF, it shouldbe possible to control dumping discharges to avoid a stationary drillingunit or platform. If you need further information in this regard, please contact the MineralsManagement Service Regional Director, Gulf of Mexico OCS Region, Metairie,Louisiana.'' Based on this letter, it appears that DOI believes that oil and gas/ODMDSuse conflicts at the site are not likely. Specifically, due to provisionsafforded by 30 CFR 250.32 requiring consideration of ``unreasonable interferencewith other uses'' and by 30 CFR 250.33 and 250.34 requiring a bathymetrymap and seafloor/subsurface hazards analysis, DOI believes that ``* * *it is not necessary to constrain oil and gas lease activity via a specificprohibition in the lease agreement pertaining to placement of drillingunits and/or platforms.'' Also, due to the timing of exploration and drillingevents, use conflicts at the site were felt to be ``very unlikely.'' DOIfurther indicated that if a plan of exploration was received that identifiedthe surface locations of proposed wells, ``* * * we are confident thataccommodations can be reached between these competing uses.'' EPA is encouraged by the DOI letter. However, we wish to note that if useconflicts should nevertheless arise, the letter does not identify a mechanismfor accommodation. EPA therefore looks toward DOI/MMS to take the leadas mediator for conflict resolution of any such possible conflicts amongthe oil and gas leasee, disposal applicant, and permitting agency. EPAalso requests that DOI/MMS at this time advise the leasee of PensacolaBlocks 846 and 847 that an ODMDS is being permanently designated in portionsof these lease blocks. EPA further wishes to note that the letter doesnot specifically address (unless part of 30 CFR Part 250) use conflictsassociated with ODMDS monitoring, i.e., separating possible environmentalimpacts attributable to potential drilling structures from ODMDS disposalmaterial. EPA therefore requests that consideration be given to barge off-siteremoval of effluents produced by drilling structures (as opposed to on-siteNPDES disposal) and/or that directional drilling be considered to maximizethe distance between the drilling structure and the disposal area. In addition to telephone coordination between EPA and MMS, DOI, and theEscambia County Florida Marine Recreation Committee (MRC) during the preparationperiod of this Final Rule, telephone coordination with the State of Florida(Tallahassee, FL), COE (Mobile District and Panama City, FL) and the U.S.Navy (Charleston, SC) also occurred. Topics included artificial reef permitting,oil and gas lease block/ODMDS use conflicts, FEIS comment letters, DOI'slease block comments on the Proposed Rule, Final Rule publication and designationschedule, Final Rule development and/or artificial reef use. <ITAG tagnum="84">C. Coastal Zone Management Coordination </ITAG>EPA has determined that the designation of the Pensacola (offshore) ODMDSis consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the Florida CoastalManagement Program and has notified the State of Florida of this determination.In a letter dated October 26, 1988, the State of Florida has concurredin EPA's determination. EPA has included its consistency determinationas Appendix J in the FEIS. <ITAG tagnum="84">D. Endangered Species Coordination </ITAG>Pursuant to section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, coordination withthe National Marine Fisheries. Service (NMFS) and the U.S. Fish and WildlifeService (FWS) was conducted regarding this site designation relative toadverse effects to any endangered species under NMFS and FWS jurisdiction.By letter to the U.S. Navy dated February 18, 1987 (see FEIS, pg. 7-6),the FWS concurred in the Navy's determination that the Navy's PensacolaHomeport Project would have no adverse effect on Federally-listed threatenedor endangered species under FWS jurisdiction in the Pensacola area. Additionalconcurrence from FWS specifically relating to the designation of an ODMDSoffshore Pensacola, Florida was requested by EPA in a letter dated September13, 1988, and concurrence was received by letter dated October 4, 1988.Also, the NMFS reaffirmed concurrence in the COE's determination that thissite designation would have no adverse effects on threatened or endangeredspecies under their jurisdiction by letter dated December 14, 1987 (seeFEIS, pg. 7-5).  Verification that this concurrence is relevant to thedesignation and is still valid was obtained by EPA during a telephone conversationon September 1, 1988, with Dr. Terry Henwood, Fisheries Biologist, of theNMFS Southeast Regional Office in St. Petersburg, Florida. <ITAG tagnum="84">E. Site Designation </ITAG>The Pensacola (offshore) ODMDS is located approximately 11 statute milessouth of Pensacola Pass and occupies an area of approximately six squarestatute miles (2 x 3 mile rectangle). Water depths range from approximately65 to 80 feet. The Pensacola (offshore) ODMDS proposed for final designationis located entirely outside of Florida State waters and is defined by thefollowing coordinates:<ITAG tagnum="23">30anddegrees;08andmin16;50andmin16;andmin16; N.,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">87anddegrees;19andmin16;30andmin16;andmin16; W.;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">30anddegrees;08andmin16;50andmin16;andmin16; N.,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">87anddegrees;16andmin16;30andmin16;andmin16; W.;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">30anddegrees;07andmin16;05andmin16;andmin16; N.,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">87anddegrees;16andmin16;30andmin16;andmin16; W.;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23">30anddegrees;07andmin16;05andmin16;andmin16; N.,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="24">87anddegrees;19andmin16;30andmin16;andmin16; W.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">F. Regulatory Requirements   </ITAG>Pursuant to the Ocean Dumping Regulations, 40 CFR Part 228, five generalcriteria are used in the selection and approval for continuing use of oceandisposal sites. Sites are selected to minimize interference with othermarine activities, to keep any temporary perturbations by the disposalfrom causing significant impacts outside the disposal site, to permit effectivemonitoring to detect any perturbations from the disposal, and to detectany adverse impacts at an early stage. Where feasible, locations off theContinental Shelf and other sites that have been historically used areto be chosen. If, at any time, disposal operations at a site cause unacceptableadverse impacts, EPA will take appropriate measures to mitigate the impactor terminate disposal at the site. The disposal site conforms to the fivegeneral criteria except for the preference for historically-used sitesand sites located off the Continental Shelf. EPA has determined, basedon the information presented in the EIS, that no environmental benefitwould be obtained by selecting a site off the Continental Shelf insteadof the site in this action. Also, in this case, the site that has beenhistorically used in the area had     already been permanently designatedby EPA as the Pensacola (nearshore) ODMDS and is restricted to disposalof suitable sandy dredged material as defined earlier. A new ODMDS at Pensacolawas therefore selected. This new Pensacola (offshore) ODMDS, which is beingpermanently designated in this action, will compliment the existing Pensacola(nearshore) ODMDS since it may be used for disposal of suitable fine-graineddredged material as defined earlier.   The general criteria are given in 40 CFR 228.5 of the EPA Ocean DumpingRegulations, and 40 CFR 228.6 lists 11 specific criteria used in evaluatinga proposed disposal site to assure that the general criteria are met. EPAestablished these 11 criteria to constitute an environmental assessmentof the impact of the site for disposal. The characteristics of the Pensacola(offshore) ODMDS were reviewed in the Proposed Rule. Also, in this FinalRule (Section B), some of the responses to the FEIS, Proposed Rule, andfollow-up comment letters supplement or update some of these 11 criteria,particularly those concerning fisheries, recreation, currents, amenitiesand mineral extraction.   <ITAG tagnum="84">G. Site Management   </ITAG>Site management of the Pensacola (offshore) ODMDS is the responsibilityof EPA and the COE. The COE issues permits to all applicants for transportof dredged material intended for ocean disposal after compliance with regulationsis determined, and undergoes a public review process for its own disposalactions; however, EPA assumes overall responsibility for site management.      Currently a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the COE/South AtlanticDivision and EPA/Region IV is being developed and is to establish a monitoringframework for ODMDSs in the Region IV area, which is to lead toward site-specificmonitoring plans for individual ODMDSs. In the case of the Pensacola (offshore)ODMDS, a proposed site-specific monitoring plan and a proposed site managementplan are already developed and presented in Appendices G and I, respectively,of the FEIS. Since specifics of these proposed plans are not presentedherein, the FEIS should be consulted for such specifics. Plan conceptspresented in the FEIS include an electronic verification system or visualsurveillance that will report actual disposal information, sediment mappingto determine distribution of disposal material at the ODMDS, constructionof a horseshoe-shaped berm within the ODMDS to help contain disposal material,bathymetric measurements to assess mounding of disposal material, waterquality sampling and analysis of various parameters, and benthic samplingand analysis of sediments and benthos.    Some modifications of the proposed plans presented in the FEIS are possibleas greater understanding of the site develops. Substantive modificationswould be coordinated with appropriate Federal and State agencies. For example,revisions may be required based on monitoring data results and comparisonof those data to the DIFID dispersion model. Techniques may also vary orbe upgraded. These plans are furthermore dependent on funding, which isvia an annual budget and is therefore undetermined for each year. In general,the existence, magnitude, and implementation of the management and monitoringplans for this site are     dependent upon funding, monitoring data results,and coordination between EPA, the U.S. Navy, the COE, the State of Floridaand/or other potential users of the ODMDS. Nevertheless, EPA believes thatsite plans are needed and that the plans in the FEIS are reasonable proposalsfor the Pensacola (offshore) ODMDS.    If evidence of significant adverse environmental effects outside the Pensacola(offshore) ODMDS boundaries is discovered, EPA will take appropriate measuresto mitigate the impact or terminate disposal at the site. Conversely, ifmonitoring results exhibit no significant impact outside the ODMDS boundaries,monitoring may be discontinued or less frequent.    Related to site monitoring, EPA plans to test for tributyltin (TBT) insediment samples from dredged material from Pensacola Harbor that wouldbe projected for disposal at the ODMDS.    <ITAG tagnum="84">H. Action    </ITAG>The designation of the Pensacola (offshore) ODMDS as an EPA-approved disposalsite for suitable dredged material is being published as Final Rulemaking.Overall management of this site is the responsibility of the Regional Administratorof EPA/Region IV. The EIS provides information indicating that the ODMDSmay appropriately be designated for use.  It should be emphasized that if an ocean disposal site is designated byEPA, such a site designation does not constitute EPA's approval of dredgingprojects or actual disposal of dredged material at the site. Before oceandisposal of dredged material at the site may commence, EPA and the COEmust also evaluate the proposed dumping in accordance with the criteriain 40 CFR Part 227 of the Ocean Dumping Regulations. In any case, EPA hasthe right to disapprove the actual disposal, if it determines that environmentalconcerns under MPRSA have not been met. The Pensacola (offshore) ODMDS is not restricted to disposal use by Federalprojects; private applicants may also dispose of suitable dredged materialat the ODMDS once relevant regulations have been satisfied. This site isrestricted, however, to disposal of predominantly fine-grained dredgedmaterial from the greater Pensacola, Florida area that meets the OceanDumping Criteria, but is not suitable for beach nourishment or disposalin the existing, EPA-designated Pensacola (nearshore) ODMDS. The Pensacola(nearshore) ODMDS is restricted to suitable dredged material with a mediangrain size of andgreater;0.125 mm and a composition of andless;10% fines. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Regulatory Assessments </ITAG>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA is required to perform a RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis for all rules which may have a significant impacton a substantial number of small entities. EPA has determined that thisaction will not have a significant impact on small entities since the sitedesignation will only have the effect of providing a disposal option fordredged material. Consequently, this action does not necessitate preparationof a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.  Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.This action will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100million or more, or cause any of the other effects which would result inits being classified by the Executive Order as a ``major'' rule. Consequently,this Final Rule does not necessitate preparation of a Regulatory ImpactAnalysis.  This Final Rule does not contain any information collection requirementssubject to Office of Management and Budget review under the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>  This Final Rulemaking Notice for site designation of the Pensacola (offshore)ODMDS fills the same role as the Record of Decision required under regulationspromulgated by the Council on Environmental Quality for agencies subjectto NEPA. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 228</ITAG>Water pollution control.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Joseph R.
