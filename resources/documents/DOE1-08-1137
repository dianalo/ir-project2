An on-linecomputer system has been used to conduct the experiments for data acquisitionin the plant and parametric identification methods have been employedto derive state-space models from experimental data. The data acquisitionsystem was tested on a laboratory model turbogenerator. Simulation ofexisting models of the plant was performed on a VAX 11/780. Four setsof tests were carried out on 200- and 300MW boiler-turbine units. Thepreliminary tests involved injecting small pseudo-random disturbanceson boiler master pressure set point and recording plant responses through24 measurements. Subsequent tests have involved disturbing the governorvalve position which resulted in excitation of additional plant variables.Simultaneous disturbances on master pressure and governor valve haveled to more integrated identification than achieved by disturbing a singleset-point. Models for the complete plant and its individual sub-sectionshave been identified.</TEXT></DOC>
