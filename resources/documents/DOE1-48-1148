Renewable energy sources,electricity saving and heat-power coupling should make possible the replacementof nuclear power plants. But are solar and wind energy sources real alternatives,by which electricity can be generated cheaply and sufficiently? Or couldthe energy problem be solved by saving energy without lowering our standardof living and narrowing the development of our industry? Must we insteadburn expensive and rare fossil fuels that also have many disadvantages?For the chemical industries of the Federal Republic of Germany and Switzerlandwho are very large electricity consumers these are essential questions,on which their future competitiveness depends. The question naturallythen arises whether our nuclear power plants are really so unsafe thatwe are obliged to accept solutions that are far from ideal. The presenttechnical and economical article tries to answer these questions. 22refs., 9 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
