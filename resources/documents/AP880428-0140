But the spokesman, Ross Petzing, said Laotians and Americansstill will excavate the area, probably within the next few days.   The American survey team returned to Bangkok on Tuesday afterinspecting the wreckage of an OV-1A Mohawk aicraft, which crashedMay 15, 1966, with two U.S. servicemen aboard, Petzing said.   The spokesman said the families of the two, who have not beenidentified, were notified of the survey results.   The long-awaited excavation of the light aircraft will be thethird U.S.-Laotian search for remains of 555 Americans listed asmissing in action in Laos during the Vietnam War. The excavation isto be carried out by 14 to 16 Americans in an area of easternSavannakhet province.   The seven-man survey team was led by Lt. Col. Joe Harvey,commander of the Hawaii-based U.S. Joint Casualty ResolutionCenter. The center is charged with resolving the fates of Americansmissing in foreign wars.   Circumstances surrounding the downing of the aircraft were notknown, but several U.S. planes were shot down in easternSavannakhet while on missions to attack the Ho Chi Minh trail,which the North Vietnamese communists used to bring men andsupplies into South Vietnam. North Vietnam defeated U.S.-backedSouth Vietnam in 1975 after the United States withdrew.   Previous joint excavations in Laos were held in 1985 and 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
