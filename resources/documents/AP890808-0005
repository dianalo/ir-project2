Citing unnamed U.S. officials, the Times said the Iranians haddetected the network months before it actually collapsed and hadused the spies to give the CIA false information.   But some officials told the Times that before the network wascompromised, it yielded valuable military intelligence,particularly about the Iranian Navy's operations in the PersianGulf at a time when American naval forces were confronting theIranians.   The network did not supply intelligence on hostage cases orpolitical developments.   The Times' sources confirmed for the first time Iranian claimsthat spies had been arrested.   The sources said the Iranian military, many of whose memberswere trained in the United States, was considered one of the lessdifficult groups in the country from which to recruit agents. TheCIA had more difficulty recruiting agents from among pro-Iranianmilitants or officials in the Iranian Government who deal withLebanon.   All of those in the dismantled intelligence ring were believedto be Iranians, the Times said.   It was not known how Iran uncovered the operation or how longIran used it to feed false information to the United States.   CIA spokesman Bill Devine in Washington, when informed of theTimes report, said, ``We do not comment on allegations ofintelligence activity.''   Iran first disclosed the existence of the CIA operation on April21, when Hashemi Rafsanjani, who was then speaker of the IranianParliament, told a Friday prayer meeting in Teheran about ``severaldens of espionage.''   Over the next few months, Iranian television broadcast asuccession of programs in which purported spies confessed to theirroles.   U.S. officials told the Times that the broadcasts _ whichdescribed everything from secret writing techniques to the CIArecruitment of agents through greed, entrapment and blackmail _were a mixture of fact and fiction.   Several officials told the Times that most of those identifiedwere double agents controlled by Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
