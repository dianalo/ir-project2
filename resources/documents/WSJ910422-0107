So next month's OTC short interest could be upsomewhat, he added.</LP><TEXT>   Despite the record highs reached in the stock market, Mr.Murphy said, short sellers &quot;still firmly believe this marketis overpriced, by about 500 points&quot; on the Dow JonesIndustrial Average. With little, if any, evidence that therecession is ending and with many disappointing corporateearnings reports, he said, shorts will stay firm &quot;until theysee the recession coming to an end or until the (Dowindustrial average) drops.&quot;   Big Board short interest fell 1.2% and Amex short interestby 2%.   RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. topped the Big Board list witha total short position of more than 14 million shares. Thecompany, taken private in 1989 in the biggest leveragedbuy-out in history, recently completed a public offering.Grand Metropolitan PLC also made an initial offering ofAmerican depositary receipts in the past month; its shortinterest was 1.8 million.   Also among the biggest short-position companies wasBlockbuster Entertainment Inc. with 10 million shares, nearlydouble the prior month's level. Blockbuster's share price hasbeen hurt by reports it will face growing competition in thehome-movie business and by overly high earnings expectationsamong investors.   Saatchi andamp; Saatchi PLC saw short interest in its ADRs climbto 10.2 million from 3.6 million. The financially troubledadvertising giant recently announced a restructuring thatincluded a huge share offering. That offering wouldsubstantially dilute current shareholders' interest.   GTE Corp.'s short interest dropped sharply to 1.8 millionshares from nearly 11 million in March. Its expected mergerwith Contel Corp., which had suffered a few delays, has justbeen completed.   New York exchange short interest fell at the April 15settlement date to 723,975,470 shares from 732,687,616 sharesat midMarch. On the Amex, short interest fell to 77,458,162shares from an adjusted 79,087,784. The month included the 20trading days through April 8.   Total Big Board short interest figures have declined forthe past three months after reaching record levels of morethan 850 million shares at the end of last year. The recentmonth's level repesents a 14% retreat from the record highs.   Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, bettingthat the stock's price will decline and that they can buy theshares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet beenpurchased for return to lenders.   Although a substantial short position reflects heavyspeculation that a stock's price will decline, some investorsconsider an increase in short interest bullish because theborrowed shares eventually must be bought back.   Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also maybe caused partly by arbitraging. The figures occasionallyinclude incomplete transactions in restricted stock.   The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Boardshort interest ratio rose to 3.95 from mid-March's 3.40, butstill is down considerably from several months ago, when theratio exceeded 5.0. The ratio is the number of trading daysat the exchange's average daily trading volume that would berequired to convert the total short interest position.Average daily New York exchange volume for the 20 tradingdays was 182,850,500 shares. Some analysts suggest, however,that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator becauseoptions and other products can be used to hedge shortpositions.   Among bellwether issues, International Business MachinesCorp.'s short position was reduced 45% to about 3.2 millionshares; American Express Co. declined 28% to nearly threemillion, and General Motors Corp. was down nearly 25% to 3.2million shares.   The following tables show the Big Board and Amex issues inwhich a short interest position of at least 100,000 sharesexisted at mid-April or in which the short position hadchanged by at least 50,000 shares since mid-March (seeaccompanying tables -- WSJ April 22, 1991).   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          THE TOTAL SHORT INTEREST position in BlockbusterEntertainment Corp. declined by 188,669 shares, for thetrading month ended April 15, when giving effect to a 2-for-1stock split declared last month. In yesterday's edition thecompany's position was reported as nearly doubling, withoutnoting the stock split.   (WSJ April 23, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
