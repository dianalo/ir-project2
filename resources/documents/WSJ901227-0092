With spending churning out of control to an annual rate of11% and revenue growth slowing to 5% a year in a softeningeconomy, legislative analyst Elizabeth Hill calculates thatCalifornia faces a budget gap of about $6 billion over thenext 18 months.</LP><TEXT>   The looming deficit caught many lawmakers here in thestate capital by surprise, as they adopted a budget in Julythat had enough left over for a $1 billion reserve. Now, whenthe legislators return next month, both they and Gov.-electPete Wilson will be forced into hard choices that couldantagonize segments of the voting public.   The choices boil down to raising taxes in a state wherethe national tax revolt was born, hacking away at a budgetjealously guarded by special interests or doing some of both.Lawmakers already are taking to party lines, with Democratsfavoring tax increases and Republicans supporting deeperspending cuts. Democratic legislators have been at war withRepublican Gov. George Deukmejian for much of his eight-yearterm.   This deficit is so large, though, that the partisanshipseems to many to be softer than it has been in years. Acompromise combination of spending cuts and tax increases isbecoming widely expected, as well as a bipartisan attempt torestructure fundamental problem areas in the budget.   &quot;If the state is going to survive this situation, therewill have to be real substantive reform, which means both theDemocrats and Republicans are going to have to take off theirpartisan hats and put on their bipartisan hats,&quot; said StevenA. Merksamer, a Sacramento lawyer and veteran politicalobserver.   For their part, Democratic legislative leaders say theyare willing to work with Mr. Wilson, who has indicated he iskeeping mum about his budget plans until after he isinaugurated Jan. 7.   &quot;The election of a new governor provides us theopportunity for a fresh and constructive beginning, anopportunity California cannot afford to ignore,&quot; JohnVasconcellos, Democratic chairman of the state Assembly'sWays and Means Committee, said recently. &quot;We're out of time.Something has to give.&quot;   Lawmakers are limited in how much they can cut. As much ashalf of the budget is protected by state statute, and manyother programs have to grow just to keep up with California'spopulation, which stands at 29.5 million and is growing atabout 800,000 a year.   The population pressure, for instance, is helping to pushup the number of prison inmates at an annual average of13.6%, prompting the Department of Corrections budget to risean average of 16%. Debt service on state general obligationbonds to fund new prisons and other projects is growing at16.4% a year. And education funding for kindergarten throughhigh school -- accounting for 36% of the budget -- isincreasing by 8.2% a year as school enrollment grows almosttwice as rapidly as the state's population.   Alarmed at the amount of expenditures that are &quot;onautomatic pilot,&quot; as some have put it, the Legislature isconsidering setting up a commission to work on constitutionalrevisions aimed at making the budget more flexible.   By far the biggest chunk of the &quot;automatic pilot&quot; budgetis that for public schools and community colleges, whichrepresents 42% of the total. Under Proposition 98, passed byvoters in 1988, lawmakers can't tinker with that budgetunless two-thirds of them vote to suspend the proposition. Intheir budget battles the past two years, Gov. Deukmejiansought to suspend Proposition 98 but Democrats held itsacrosanct and pushed for tax increases instead.   That battle could begin anew in January, with theDemocratic-controlled Senate Revenue and Taxation Committeealready compiling a long list of tax alternatives. Thepossibilities include a 0.5% increase in the sales tax, whichis projected to bring in $1.5 billion, and increasing the toppersonal income tax rate to 10.3% from 9.3%, adding $1.6billion to state revenue.   Watching anxiously from the sidelines will be theCalifornia taxpayers. Though the state's voters havehistorically been anti-tax -- they turned down most of thetax-raising initiatives that were on last month's electionballot -- the current budget crisis is so severe, many say,that they may have to resign themselves to making a fewsacrifices.</TEXT></DOC>
