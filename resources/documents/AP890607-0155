SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The State Department, calling the situation inChina ``volatile, uncertain and increasingly dangerous,'' orderedthe evacuation on Wednesday of its 258 diplomatic dependents andurged all other private Americans to leave as soon as possible.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and U.S. Ambassador JamesLilley ``are strongly urging all American citizens to leave China,''State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler told reporters.   ``The situation is deteriorating,'' she said.   The evacuation order and the new warning to private citizensreflect a heightened concern by the U.S. government about thesituation in Beijing, as well as in the provinces outside thecapital. The United States has no legal authority to force privateAmericans to leave the country.   On Tuesday, the department had urged private U.S. citizens onlyto leave Beijing, the center of the turmoil sparked by weeks ofpro-democracy demonstrations.   The evacuation was ordered after Chinese troops raked adiplomatic compound with gunfire and another incident in whichChinese soldiers surrounded an apartment complex housing U.S.diplomats and prevented them from leaving the area for some time.   No Americans were injured, Ms. Tutwiler said.   ``The situation in Beijing, and in China, is volatile, uncertainand increasingly dangerous,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.   She refused to describe the situation in the country as ``civilwar.''   But the spokeswoman, who said a day earlier that she couldn'tverify that fighting among the military had occurred, confirmed thatsome clashes between small army units had taken place.   The United States has chartered commercial aircraft to fly toBeijing and Shanghai to supplement regular U.S. airline departures.Also, officials have organized transportation to help U.S. citizensget to the airports, the spokeswoman said.   She said that the road to the Beijing airport remained open andthat Chinese officials are allowing the extra charter flights toland.   Two aircraft, one from United Airlines and another fromContinental Airlines, will leave Beijing Thursday, and there is apossibility of a third, she said.   A regularly scheduled flight is slated to leave Friday. Otherplanes will be chartered if necessary, she added.   Their purpose is ``to facilitate the departure of all those whowant to leave and all those who have been ordered to leave,'' shesaid.   Ms. Tutwiler said she did not know the exact destination of theflights.   Although the shooting at the diplomatic compound appeared to bewarning shots fired into the air, dozens of bullets struck windowsfacing the street in the housing area for diplomats and otherforeign residents about 2{ miles east of Tiananmen Square.   The U.S. Embassy's chief of security said bullets had pierced awindow into a room where his two children were watching television.   An administration official, who spoke on condition he not benamed, said U.S. officials believe that 84-year-old Deng Xioaping,who has been reported in ill health ``is still alive ... and stillrunning the show.''   The official noted that while the U.S. government can't orderprivate citizens to leave the country, ``a real change'' ofatmosphere has taken place in recent days, and that ``more and morepeople'' have decided to leave the country.   The official said that there are ``a fair number of children''among the 258 dependents and non-essential personnel who have beenordered to leave and that officials are making sure every child isaccompanied by either a parent or a friend on the flights out of thecountry.   Ms. Tutwiler said ambassador Lilley had met with Vice ForeignMinister Xhu Qizhan ``and registered a strong protest'' about anincident of rifle fire that broke windows in apartments occupied byU.S. government employees.   Ms. Tutwiler said the U.S. government had no evidence that anythreats had been made directly against Americans or other foreignersbut, given the increasingly chaotic situation, it was ``prudent andwise'' to order the evacuation.   The Chinese government, meanwhile, notified the department thatit had decided to postpone next week's visit of Foreign MinisterQian Qichen.   ``Our government agreed it was wise to postpone (the visit) atthis time,'' the spokeswoman said. She said the Chinese gave noexplanation for the change of plans.   Ms. Tutwiler emphasized that no U.S. diplomats had been orderedto leave, adding that their presence was necessary to aid thedeparture of other U.S. citizens.   The spokeswoman said the State Department's ``best estimate'' isthat there are about 1,000 Americans still in Beijing.   Although some 8,800 Americans had notified U.S. officials inJanuary that there were somewhere in China, ``we do not have anyaccurate number of how many Americans are in China'' at the presenttime, she said.   She added that the number of Americans appears to have``dramatically been reduced'' over the last several days as U.S.businesses have asked their workers to leave.   Besides leaving on the U.S.-flag carriers, Americans have alsodeparted on other national carriers, Ms. Tutwiler noted. She saidthat if there are extra seats on the U.S. planes, citizens fromother nations will be allowed to use them.</TEXT></DOC>
