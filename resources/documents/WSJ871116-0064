It had deposits totaling $47.3 million, the FSLIC said, and 290 of those deposits exceeded the insurance limit of $100,000 per depositor. Tri-County is the 15th association nationwide to be liquidated in 1987, the first in New Jersey.    Separately, federal regulators closed West Texas State Bank of Canyon, Canyon, Texas, bringing the number of bank failures nationwide this year to 160.    The sole office of the failed bank, which had assets of $19.9 million, was scheduled to reopen today as a branch of First National Bank of Amarillo, Amarillo, Texas.    West Texas State Bank, which had deposits of $19.1 million in 6,100 accounts, was the 45th bank in Texas to close this year. </TEXT></DOC>
