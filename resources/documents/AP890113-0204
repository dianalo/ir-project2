The proposed Health Code amendment, which could be in effect byMarch, would require photographs, identifying tattoos, mandatoryregistration and proof that the animal had been spayed or neutered.   The proposed regulations also call for owners to be at least 18years old and that they carry $100,000 in liability insurance.   The rules would eventually ban all pit bulls from the city afterthose who are registered die or are moved out.   ``If a pup was born after the registration period, that pup wouldhave to be taken out of the city or disposed of,'' said Dr. StephenJoseph, the city's health commissioner.   Pit bulls were cited in 422 bite cases involving humans betweenNovember 1987 and September, said Health Department counsel IrwinDavison. That's about 14 percent of the 3,057 bite cases reported inthat period, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
