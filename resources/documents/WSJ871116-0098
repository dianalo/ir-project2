The directive would require upper-echelon Pentagon brass to take a greater role in overseeing the program, currently managed by the Air Force. A group of senior Pentagon officials would determine ways to make the Los Angeles-based company more accountable, including equipment tests and audits, and report to Congress in April.    The little-noticed directive was part of the massive Pentagon budget bill approved by House and Senate negotiators late last week.    Congressional aides say that a major goal of the directive is to loosen Northrop's sole management control of the Stealth program by introducing competition from other aerospace companies in areas such as managing subcontracts, acting as independent consultants or performing final assembly of the aircraft. They add that another goal is to pressure the Air Force to disclose problems to the House and Senate armed services committees, which have been surprised in the past few months by revelations about problems in the MX missile and the B-1B bomber programs.    The directive also requires the Secretary of Defense to declassify and make public certain information about the program's cost, its annual budget request and its schedule.    Northrop officials couldn't be reached for comment on the directive.    The Air Force has said it intends to spend $36.6 billion on 132 of the bombers, which would carry nuclear weapons, for deployment in the 1990s. The name &quot;Stealth&quot; comes from the plane's supposed ability to evade enemy radar, although the aircraft's official name is the advanced technology bomber.    The cost of the bomber has assumed increasing importance because the Pentagon would be likely to ask Congress for funds to buy more of the strategic bombers if arms treaty negotiators succeed in limiting intermediate-range nuclear missiles.    Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.), the House Armed Services Committee chairman who introduced the directive, has been pushing for changes in Northrop's handling of the bomber program, which has been plagued by rumors that it was behind schedule and indications that it was over budget. As a classified program, annual funding and progress reports on the program aren't made public, although they are provided to Mr. Aspin and certain other members of Congress.    However, an Air Force general disclosed earlier this year that the service had transferred some money earmarked for the future production phase of the program to the current research and development phase. In the past year, Northrop has taken write-downs totaling $214 million pretax on a research and development program that aerospace industry analysts identified as the Stealth bomber.    In April, Mr. Aspin proposed providing $100 million to solicit other aerospace companies to participate in the project. However, the directive includes only an initial $10 million for the Pentagon group to develop a plan to inform Congress about the bomber's expected capabilities and schedule, design audits and identify areas of competition. </TEXT></DOC>
