A quarterly foreign-exchange report issued Wednesday by theFederal Reserve Bank of New York showed the Fed and the Treasurysold $11.92 billion in exchange for West German marks and Japaneseyen during the three months ended July 31.   It was the largest intervention since the winter of 1978-79, whenthe government leaned the opposite way, buying $6.9 billion withmarks and yen to support a dollar that was being eroded by highinflation.   The previous largest sale of dollars occurred when the Fed dumped$3.2 billion from August to October of 1985. That sale reflected anagreement among the big industrialized nations, known as the Groupof Seven, to lower the dollar's value to shrink the U.S. tradedeficit.   The latest quarterly New York Fed report showed the governmentbought $7.24 billion worth of yen and $4.68 billion worth of marks.Overseas central banks also sold dollars, according to the report.   The United States sold $6.74 billion in May, $4.95 billion inJune and $230 million in July.   The dollar reached its peak of the year in early June, when ittraded at two-year highs of 2.047 marks and 151.90 yen, up roughly 9percent and 14 percent respectively from the end of April. However,by the end of July it was up just 3 percent against the yen and lessthan 1 percent vs. the mark.   Samuel Y. Cross, an executive vice president for the New YorkFed, attributed the retreat from the peak to the central bank dollarsales and changing perceptions about the economy.   Lately the dollar has been trading around 1.97 marks and 146 yen,its highest levels since the May-July period, due to signs ofrenewed strength in the economy.   Currency traders already suspected that the Fed had intervenedheavily during the period, but the Fed's policy is to comment onlywell after the fact. In early 1987 the Group of Seven nations _Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and the UnitedStates _ agreed to work together to stabilize the currency marketsfollowing a sharp decline in the dollar. The group also secretly settarget zones for exchange rates, although it has never confirmedthat the zones exist or what they are.   ``All the intervention we did could be taken as an indication wewanted to ... bring about greater stability in the exchange rates,''said Cross. ``We're not driving it down as much as keeping it fromrising.''   Fed intervention was the strongest in late May, when the dollarfirst pierced the psychologically important 2-mark and 142-yenlevels. At that time, investment demand was strong because U.S.interest rates remained high in comparison to rates abroad.   During the dollar's surge, the economy appeared strong and thetrade deficit seemed to be shrinking. Traders decided to test thecentral bank's firmness in holding down the dollar.   Also adding support to the dollar was political turmoil abroad,including the bloody crackdown against student protesters in Chinaand government scandals in Japan.   By late June the dollar had softened as interest rates began todrop and signs of slower economic growth began to emerge.</TEXT></DOC>
