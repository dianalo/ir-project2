CT has been found to be a valuablediagnostic method allowing to differentiate between inflammations, abscessesand neoplasms. It provides information on the loci of pathological processesand helps identify the nature of the processes. It has most frequentlybeen used in perimaxillary abscesses, in maxillary sinus pathologies,in the jaw bone disease, in maxillofacial injuries, in neoplastic diseasesand in sialotomography. It has not, however, been found to be the methodof choice in this discipline but only an invaluable complementary diagnosticmethod which should be used discriminately and in cases where more informationis needed than provided by conventional X-ray radiography and other classicalmethods.
