The reports, based on transcripts of tapped telephone calls,were presented to a Frankfurt court. They indicated Hamadi was inIran for about three months and was helped while in hiding byIran's Revolutionary Guards.   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, has been accused of air piracyand murder. He went on trial here after West Germany refused a U.S.extradition request.   TWA flight 847 was hijacked in June 1985 and 39 Americans wereheld captive aboard the plane for 17 days. Navy diver RobertStethem was shot and killed by the sky pirates who comandeered thejet during a flight from Athens to Rome and forced it to land inBeirut.   Former hostage Pete W. Hill of Hoffman Estates, Ill., isscheduled to testify Wednesday. He will be the first American totestify in the trial that reopened Tuesday after a four-week recess.   Prosecutors say Hamadi was a member of Hezbollah, a pro-IranianShiite group believed to hold most of the 18 foreigners, includingnine Americans, kidnapped by terrorists in Lebanon.   Hamadi has admitted he was one of the TWA hijackers but insistshe did not kill Stethem, 23.   The court on Tuesday examined transcripts of tapped telephonecalls Hamadi made from Iran to his brother, Abbas Hamadi, after thehijacking was over.   In an Aug. 14, 1985, telephone call to Abbas Hamadi's home inWest Germany, Mohammed Hamadi said, ``I'm phoning from Iran.''   According to the transcript, Mohammed Hamadi told his brother hewas staying in an Iranian town near the Afghan border and he added:``I've been here more than a month and it's very boring. I'm justsitting around.''   In another telephone call from Iran on Oct. 13, 1985, MohammedHamadi told his brother he was going back to Beirut the next day,but Abbas Hamadi warned him he would be arrested because he waswanted by U.S. authorities, according to the transcripts.   Mohammed Hamadi also said, ``We're going on a military plane toSyria and then we're taking a military car to Beirut.''   Abbas Hamadi then asked him who told him about the travelarrangements and his broher replied, ``The Revolutionary Guards.'   In earlier testimony Hamadi told the court he was in Iran tovisit Moslem shrines. He refused to answer any questions Tuesdayabout his stay in Iran.   Hamadi had admitted at the trial's session on Aug. 9 before therecess began that he took part in the hijacking.   Tuesday he refused to answer answer many questions from ChiefJudge Heiner Mueckenberger about what happened aboard the hijackedplane but repeated his denial that he killed Stethem.   ``I already said the other (one of his accomplices) wasresponsible and he was the murderer,'' Hamadi said.   ``Our orders were not to kill. We were told to hijack the plane,to force it to land and to state our demands. But not to kill,'' hesaid. He would not say who issued those orders.   Hamadi said again that the hijackers' goal was to force therelease of Lebanese prisoners held by Israel. Shortly after thehijacking was over Israel released about 700 prisoners.   U.S. officials have indicted four people in the hijacking,including Hamadi. West Germany last year rejected a U.S.extradition request for Hamadi, saying he would be tried here onthe same charges.   Hamadi was arrested on Jan. 13, 1987, at Frankfurt airport, whencustoms inspectors found explosives in his luggage.   In April, a Duesseldorf court sentenced Abbas Hamadi to 13 yearsin prison for involvement in the abductions of two Germanbusinessmen in Lebanon in an unsuccessful attempt to force WestGermany to free Mohammed Hamadi from prison.</TEXT></DOC>
