Roses and mimosa, jasmine and bougainvillea cover the serratedremains of buildings in Kandahar, which was the seat of Afghan kingstwo centuries ago.   Block after block of mud-walled dwellings that were bombed,rocketed and shelled by Moslem guerrillas and Afghan soldiers havebeen transformed into ghost neighborhoods of jagged walls andcollapsed archways, twisted beams and shattered wooden roofs.   Other buildings are heavily damaged by bullets and shrapnel. Someare boarded up and locked.   What remains, often compared to Beirut, is a monument to thesuffering caused by 11 years of war since the communist coup of1978, in which Soviet military forces took part for nine years. TheRed Army withdrew in February.   Even army officers and government officials are half-hearted intrying to blame the destruction solely on the guerrillas, most ofwhose arms are supplied by the United States.   ``Every day the Soviets were here was a disaster,'' an armyofficer said privately. ``All they touched turned to dust. Now thatwe are on our own, every day gets a little better.''   Guerrillas have tried since October 1987 to capture Kandahar,whose name derives from the Arabic for Alexander.   The conqueror's army passed through in 329 B.C. For centuriesafter that, India and Persia fought over Kandahar, which wasstrategically located on the central Asian trade routes.   Since early May, the government has claimed that guerrillas _known as the mujahedeen, or holy warriors _ and Pakistani soldierswere planning a new assault on the city. Kandahar is 70 miles fromPakistan, where the main guerrilla groups are based.   Most guerrilla commanders deny the charge, and say instead thatthey agreed seven months ago to stop attacks on the city and turntheir rockets and mortars on army posts and on the airport 15 milesnorth of the city.   ``For every communist killed, as many as 100 innocent people maydie'' if the city is shelled, said commander Mulah Naqib of thefundamentalist Jamiat-i-Islami, or Islamic Society of Afghansitan,considered the best-organized and most efficient fighting group.   ``These are the people who helped us against the Russians,'' hesaid. ``These are the people who gave us food and protection at atime when we were getting no outside aid. Why should we kill or hurtthem?''   Naqib commands about 4,000 of the estimated 20,000 guerrillasaround Kandahar, which was Afghanistan's second-largest city beforethe war.   Only one of the seven often-feuding resistance groups based inPakistan _ the fundamenalist Hebz-i-Islami (Party of Islam) led byGulbuddin Hekmatyar _ has refused to stop shelling the city, thefield commanders said.   Some said they may be forced to save some weapons and ammunitionto fight Hekmatyar's men.   Government officials said the population fell from 300,000 toabout 25,000 when the bombardment was at its heaviest.   Residents who fled to Pakistan or Iran have begun returning, eventhough up to 30 rockets still hit the city every day.   Lt. Gen. Nurul Haq Ulumi, military governor of Kandahar province,said: ``Seventy percent of the buildings in the city have beencompletely destroyed. The remaining 30 percent have been hit by atleast one bullet.''   Workers have begun building playgrounds for children andrepairing badly minarets on neighborhood mosques. In the batteredshops of the bazaar, teen-age boys in turbans inspect Japanese-madeelectronics goods and women in full-length veils bargain withvendors for grapes and melons.   People travel on bicycles and donkeys, on horses sometimesdecorated with silver bells and brightly colored woolen balls, alongpaved streets chewed up by tanks.   Most gasoline stations are closed for lack of supplies, so nearlyall the motor traffic is military.   ``Two years ago, on any day of the week at any hour of the day,you couldn't leave your house,'' the army officer said, driving pastrows of shattered government houses. ``This is still war, but it'sjust not as bad.''   Soldiers and guerrillas are within yards of each other in tworings around the city, but appear to be observing a comparativetruce, at least for a time.   ``We all want the same thing,'' Ulumi said. He is a member of theDurrani tribe, which produced the kings of Afghanistan until themonarch was overthrown in 1973.   ``The government, the mujahedeen, the refugees in Pakistan, Iranand the West all want the same thing. We want to live together inpeace,'' he said in an interview at his office in Governor's House,where portraits of the former kings hang. ``We were friends beforethe war. We can be friends in the future.''   Guerrilla commanders feel, however, that talking with PresidentNajib is tantamout to accepting the Soviet legacy from a war thathas cost more than 1 million lives.   ``We have problems with Najib and his government,'' Naqib said.``They are still the enemy. Maybe we'll see each other and sit downand talk. God willing, one day we will. But now isn't the righttime.''</TEXT></DOC>
