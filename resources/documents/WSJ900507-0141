Its engineers had designed a revolutionarycompressor and a futuristic factory to make it.   GE was so certain the new product would leapfrog Japaneserivals that it staked its entire $2 billion refrigeratorbusiness on the innovative design of the compressor -- thepump that creates cold air, as crucial to a refrigerator asan engine to a car. The old compressor was scrapped. At theappliance division's headquarters here, managers were settingout to prove that America could still be a world leader inmanufacturing.</LP><TEXT>   But today, the very managers who had defiantly refused tobuy compressors from overseas rivals are doing exactly that.Now, when GE assembles refrigerators at its plants inLouisville, Indiana and Alabama, it uses compressorspurchased from six suppliers, five of them foreign.   The project, says Roger Schipke, the division's formerchief, &quot;was your worst nightmare come true. I don't even wantto think about it anymore.&quot; Mr. Schipke now is the presidentof Ryland Group Inc., a Columbia, Md., home builder.   GE's new compressor flopped so badly that the company hadto take a $450 million pretax charge in 1988. And since earlylast year, it has voluntarily replaced nearly 1.1 milliondefective compressors.   At first, it was changing 5,000 a week. Even now, theprocess goes on. In a kitchen in rural Beaver County nearPittsburgh, serviceman Paul Jackson yanks a defectivecompressor from the back of an almond-colored refrigerator.He replaces it with one made in Italy. The changeover takes90 minutes. Still to be repaired: as many as 200,000refrigerators, many of which can't be located.   The full story of GE's fiasco has never been told. Afterinterviews on the matter with more than 30 current and formerGE employees, the tale that emerges offers a lesson for allmanufacturers.   GE's travails don't show that America should stop tryingto compete with the Japanese -- who, as GE later discovered,had similar troubles with the same compressor design. Rather,the story illustrates how even a company with GE's vastresources and formidable skills can fall into trouble if itgoes too far, too fast. Pioneering new technology carriesgreat risks along with the possibility of great rewards, andthe risks may indicate that a manufacturer should phase in anew product gradually.   &quot;You have to have that magical balance between getting itright and getting it fast. Obviously, we didn't have that,&quot;says Stephen Holmes, who was one of several GE managers thatsupervised the refrigerator's design and who now is a vicepresident at rival Whirlpool Corp. Adds DietrichHuttenlocher, a former GE technical trouble-shooter who waspart of the research team that investigated the failure: &quot;GElearned a hard lesson: Don't cut corners on the testing.&quot;   Blunders were committed at practically every level. Indesigning the compressor, engineers made some bad assumptionsand then failed to ask the right questions. Managers, eagerto cut costs, forced the engineers to accelerate &quot;lifetesting&quot; of the compressor, curtailed field testing andrushed into production.   Ultimately, the problems stemmed from poor corporatecommunication. Several low-level salaried employees at GE --the technicians who did the actual pre-production testing --say they suspected that the compressor might be defective andtold their superiors. But senior executives, six levelsremoved, heard only good news.   In retrospect, Richard Burke, the appliance division'scurrent chief of technology and manufacturing, says he wouldhave done it differently. &quot;I'd have gone and found the lowestdamn level people we had . . . and just sat down in theirlittle cubbyholes and asked them `How are things today?' &quot;   How could such errors be made at GE, widely acclaimed forits management?   From the start, GE was under pressure. In the fall of1981, when the compressor saga began, the appliancedivision's market share -- and profits -- were falling.   What's more, GE was using antiquated methods to makerefrigerators, the core of the appliance group. GE'scompressor plant -- Building 4 in the Appliance Park complexthat employs 12,300 in Louisville -- was relying on 1950stechnology and lots of manpower. Making a single piston took220 steps. Even simple grinding operations were done by hand.GE took 65 minutes of labor to make a compressor. Rivals inJapan and Italy made theirs in just 25 minutes and, becauseof lower labor rates, at half the cost.   Ira C. Magaziner, a Providence, R.I., consultant broughtin for advice, handed down a somber verdict: either buycompressors abroad or find a way to build better ones. (Mr.Magaziner's findings are recounted in his 1989 managementbook, &quot;The Silent War,&quot; which praised GE's efforts to buildthe new compressor.)   After a fierce internal debate, appliance-divisionexecutives decided to build their own. On Sept. 1, 1983, Mr.Schipke and two senior engineers flew to Connecticut to sellthe idea to GE Chairman Jack Welch. (Mr. Welch declined to beinterviewed.) The division executives proposed that GE commit$120 million to build a factory in Columbia, Tenn., about 50miles south of Nashville. The factory would make a newlydesigned compressor -- the rotary -- a technology that GE hadinvented but used only in air conditioners.   &quot;We told them it wasn't a moonshot. We knew how to makerotaries. We'd made 12 million of them in air conditioners,&quot;Mr. Schipke recalls. Mr. Welch agreed. So did directors atGE's next board meeting.   In reality, though, the rotary was a moonshot inrefrigerators. At first glance, the new design seemed ideal.It weighed less and was more energy-efficient thanold-fashioned reciprocating compressors, which had threetimes as many parts. The new design and new factory wouldhalve GE's compressor-production costs.   But Peter Davey, a former chief design engineer forrefrigerators, cites &quot;a whole lot of reasons you don't gointo a rotary compressor fast.&quot; Mr. Davey, who retired in1981, and others had long argued that rotaries weren't goodin refrigerators.   Rotaries run hotter than traditional compressors. Thatisn't a problem in most air conditioners; fast-flowingcoolant cools the compressor. But in a refrigerator, whichtypically runs four times as many hours as an air conditionerin a year's time, coolant flows one-tenth as fast. Andexcessive heat can kill a compressor.   Even in air conditioners, moreover, rotaries aren'tperfect. Introduced in 1957, they initially caused trouble.Gradually, the bugs were worked out. But in the mid-1970s, GEhad to abandon rotaries in its big air conditioners. Thecompressors broke down in hot climates; failures in SaudiArabia and Arizona eventually persuaded management to returnto reciprocating compressors in the big units.   Despite these portents, GE's refrigerator managers andengineers were fixated on other issues. One was noise.Fearful that the rotary's high-pitched whine would spookconsumers, executives argued over ways to mask it. Managersand consumer test panels spent hours listening to the newrefrigerators.   Another time-consuming issue concerned manufacturing. Thenew design required the key parts to work together at afriction point of fifty-millionths of an inch -- aboutone-hundredth the width of a human hair. Nothing had everbeen mass produced at such an extreme tolerance.   The manufacturing engineers, led by Tom Blunt, felt surethey could do it. But they needed a little help -- and thedesign engineers, working across the hall, provided it. Thecompressor that GE ultimately manufactured was nearlyidentical to the rotary used in air conditioners. There wasone change, though, and it turned out to be disastrous.   Two small parts inside the compressor were made out of anew material, powdered metal, rather than the hardened steeland cast iron in air conditioners. Powdered metal -- made byfusing a fine powder into solid metal through pressure --pleased two groups: manufacturing engineers, because it wouldbe more easily machined to extreme tolerance, and managers,because it cut machining costs.   However, powdered metal had been tried a decade earlier inair conditioners and &quot;didn't hold up,&quot; says Burr Stanton, anevaluation engineer who supervised tests on it in the early1970s. He and others say that information was passed on tothe design engineers. But they didn't listen, he says. &quot;Theguys who were designing it were new to compressors. Theyfigured they were smarter and thought it wouldn't happen tothem,&quot; Mr. Stanton explains.   The engineers who did the actual design were assembled bythe appliance division's chief design engineer, JohnTruscott. Before coming to Louisville, Mr. Truscott wasconsidered one of GE's top technologists; he had been, forexample, on an aerospace team involved in the breaking of thesound barrier.   Now, he and the engineers on his team believed, GE wouldshow that it still could be a world leader in manufacturing.But, like him, his engineers were new to compressors. &quot;Johnfigured you didn't need previous compressor-design experienceto design a new compressor,&quot; one associate says. Mr.Truscott, who retired last year, declined to be interviewed.   Moreover, the team he assembled was convinced that itdidn't need outside help. Mr. Magaziner, the consultant, hadrecommended that the design be joint-ventured with a Japaneseproducer that already had a refrigerator rotary on themarket. Mr. Truscott rejected that idea.   The team also rejected help from Milton Kosfeld, who, as aGE design engineer in the 1950s, had invented the rotary forair conditioners. He left GE in 1969, but in 1983, beforejoining his present employer, Bristol Compressors of Bristol,Va., he offered his consulting services to the design team.They declined, writing him that &quot;they had sufficienttechnical expertise,&quot; he says.   Limited testing of a compressor prototype began in 1982.Within a year of getting the board's final go-ahead inSeptember 1983, the evaluation engineers had &quot;life tested&quot;about 600 compressors. In the fall of 1984, when 20 seniorexecutives met to review the test data, there wasn't a singledocumented failure. &quot;It looked too good to be true,&quot; recallsJames Lehman, a finance official who attended the meeting.   It was. If they had known what some technicians knew, theywouldn't have been so sanguine. Though the compressors hadn'tfailed, they didn't look right, either, according to one ofthe technicians, Paul Schank. He had worked in the Louisvilletesting lab for more than 30 years -- and knew compressors.After running the compressors continuously for about twomonths -- under temperatures and pressures supposedlysimulating five years' operating life -- Mr. Schank woulddisassemble them and inspect the parts.   About 15% of them, he says, were suspect: Copper windingson the motor were discolored, a sign of excessive heat.Bearing surfaces appeared worn. And some small parts had ablack, oily crust -- evidence, he thought, that high heat wasbreaking down the sealed lubricating oil.   Mr. Schank's direct supervisors -- a total of four inthree years -- discounted the findings and apparently didn'trelay them up the chain of command. They believed in thebasic air-conditioner design and thought the tests farexceeded field conditions. But Mr. Schank contends that thesupervisors didn't have the proper technical background toask the right questions and didn't want to do anything thatmight derail so big a project.   `The bottom line was that GE would save massive sums ofmoney on each new compressor, and, if they brought theproject in on schedule, they'd look like heroes,&quot; he says.Adds Robert Derman, who worked with Mr. Schank: &quot;The pressureto get this project done was enormous. It was an awfully bigtask, and there just wasn't enough time to do it right.&quot;   Others involved in the project dispute that, but nearlyall agree that the pressure to produce influenced the testresults. Although GE offered a five-year warranty on therefrigerator's cooling system, it couldn't wait for fiveyears of testing. But &quot;life testing&quot; -- simulating harshconditions -- can be a tricky guide to a new product's futurereliability. In the past, GE had always supplemented suchestimates with extensive field testing. This time, fieldtesting was curtailed. The original plan, to put models inthe field for two years, was revised to about nine months asmanagers raced to keep up with their schedules.   &quot;Nobody liked the idea that we weren't getting the properfield exposure,&quot; one engineer says. &quot;But it would have takena lot of courage to tell Welch that we had slipped offschedule.&quot;   Meanwhile Mr. Stanton, the retired engineer, was hired asa consultant to evaluate the testing. He considered the testssuspect, he says, because only one compressor had failed intwo years -- an extraordinarily low number. He says herecommended to a management committee that the testconditions be intensified. But &quot;they didn't want to embark ona new program at that point,&quot; he says.   In the end, the schedule was met. By March 1986, some 21/2 years after board approval, the Tennessee factory wasturning out rotary compressors at a rate of one every sixseconds, an amazing feat given the manufacturing tolerances.Later that year, Mr. Blunt, the chief manufacturing engineer,passed out coffee mugs to hundreds of Louisville colleaguesto commemorate production of the 1,000,000th compressor.   Consumers, too, were pleased. They snapped up the newmodels, which featured other innovations, such as arefreshment center in the door. In 1986, GE's market share inrefrigerators shot up two full percentage points to about30%, its best showing in years.   But in July 1987, a bad omen: The first refrigerator -- inan unventilated closet in Philadelphia -- failed after littlemore than one year. At first, executives thought it was afluke. Then, they got reports of failures in Puerto Rico. Ateam of technicians investigated. By Labor Day, Louisvilleknew it had a big problem. Over the next few months, as thetoll of failed refrigerators mounted, GE engineers workedfuriously, often through the night, trying to diagnose themalady.   By December, they still lacked satisfactory answers. So,Mr. Schipke, then the appliance-division chief, pulled theplug on the new compressor. The news, one manufacturingengineer says, literally made him sick. &quot;How do you think theengineers at Thiokol felt when the Challenger blew up?&quot; heasks.   GE scoured the globe for compressors. They weren't easy tofind. Ultimately, GE had to persuade one U.S. manufacturerthat had quit the business, Tecumseh Products Co., to getback into it. And it provided Tecumseh with GE-built motors,airlifted from Singapore. GE also had to fly Japanesecompressors to Louisville.   Perhaps just as disheartening, the new factory workedfine. Only the design had failed. By the summer of 1988, theteam investigating the failure rendered its verdict: The twopowdered-metal parts were wearing excessively, burning up theoil and eventually choking off all cold air to therefrigerator.   With the problem identified, managers acted swiftly tocorrect it and, in the process, sidestepped a potentiallydevastating blow to GE's refrigerator business. Buyers of therefrigerators -- some units cost $2,000 -- were made whole;the compressors were replaced, usually even before thecustomers knew anything was wrong.   So far, the company says, not a single lawsuit has beenfiled against it. In fact, GE's U.S. market share inrefrigerators rose during the 1980s, according to Appliancemagazine, as the company widened its lead over No. 2Whirlpool. The Tennessee factory was kept running, though athalf its rated capacity, through a contract to supply FeddersCorp. with air-conditioning compressors.   Meanwhile, GE has redesigned the compressor, abandonedpowdered-metal parts and developed new lubricants. It alsochanged its testing procedures. GE says it plans to bring thenew compressor back into limited production this fall.   The man now in the hot seat, division engineering managerMark Schreck, says he's &quot;absolutely convinced we've got ahigh quality compressor.
