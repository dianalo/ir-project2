In the railroad industry, however, such advance-notification requirements have been in existence since the 1930s. And this is where your reference to &quot;job poison&quot; is well taken.    The Interstate Commerce Act requires railroads to provide 90 days' advance notice to union officials of line abandonments (the railroad equivalent of a plant closing) or other changes resulting from mergers or consolidations. Prior to implementing the abandonment or consolidation, an &quot;implementing agreement&quot; must be reached with the involved unions.    Any employee adversely affected by these changes is guaranteed, by statute, full income protection for up to six years or, as an alternative for those employees whose jobs are eliminated, a lump-sum severance allowance of 16 months' pay. The parties can negotiate upward from these &quot;minimum&quot; benefits in exchange for a speedy resolution of the &quot;implementing agreement.&quot;    What has all of this meant for railroad employees? Railroad employment stood at 1.3 million in 1947. Ten years ago it stood at 471,519. It currently stands at 230,000 employees. The industry with the most elaborate federally imposed advance-notification and employee-protection arrangements has witnessed some of the largest decreases in employment. This clearly demonstrates that real job security can be based only on viable companies in viable industries rather than on government fiat.    D.J.
