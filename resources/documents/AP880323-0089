Nationwide, about 800 companies have developed child-carecenters on or near their business, according to the survey beingpublished in the April issue of Personnel Journal in Costa Mesa,Calif. Most of these are large companies or public agencies.   ``The majority of U.S. employers are not establishing child-carecenters,'' wrote the authors, Toni A. Campbell of San Jose StateUniversity in California and David E. Campbell of Humboldt StateUniversity in Arcata, Calif.   On the other hand, they wrote in the survey released Tuesday,most employers surveyed thought they should be involved in familymatters.   The problems are money and information, the survey found.   ``The question appears ... not to be whether employers mightinvolve themselves, but rather how they can get involved withoutjeopardizing the bottom line,'' the authors wrote.   ``Certainly the focus on expense is a major issue for smallbusinesses,'' they added.   The survey found that eight of 10 companies surveyed believeproductivity and the quality of the work force will improve if theorganization helps employees with child-care problems.   But 71 percent said they don't want to provide space at the worksite, and 69 percent said they don't want to subsidize child-careprograms.   The researchers said many employers offer options involving workschedules to help families. Flexible hours were offered by 60percent of the companies surveyed; 71 percent offered part-timework; 24 percent had job sharing; and 71 percent gave leaves tocare for a sick child.   The researchers suggested that small companies could share thecost of locating and implementing a child-care program foremployees. They said this could be coordinated through a localChamber of Commerce or a trade group.</TEXT></DOC>
