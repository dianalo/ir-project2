(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sen. Dan Quayle attacked Democraticnominee Michael Dukakis on Friday as ``flat wrong'' on defense andforeign policy issues, and promised that Republican candidateGeorge Bush will be the American farmer's friend.   Quayle, who is Bush's vice presidential running mate told anAlabama audience that farmers should not have to compete against``illegal subsidies'' that lower the prices of goods producedoverseas.   ``As long as we can get that level playing field, the Americanfarmer will out-produce and be more competitive than any farmers inthe world,'' Quayle said.   If the Bush-Quayle ticket is elected in November, he said,``we're going to put the State Department on the side of the farmerinstead being on the side of the trading partners.''   In a blast at Dukakis, Quayle said the Republican and Democraticcandidates disagree most sharply in their approach to nationaldefense.   ``We believe in a strong national defense to deter aggressionagainst America, and he does not,'' Quayle said.   ``On matters of national defense and foreign policy, believe me,our opponent is not even half right. He's just flat wrong,'' Quaylesaid.   He said Dukakis needed ``some education about the defense ofAmerica'' because of his opposition to the Star Wars space-basedmissile defense system, the MX missile and other deterrent weaponssystems backed by the Reagan administration.   ``Michael Dukakis needs an education _ that's for sure. But thepeople ... are not about to let him get his on-the-job training inthe Oval Office at the expense of our security,'' Quayle said.   Quayle's schedule called for a visit to Orlando, Fla., for astudent rally at the University of Central Florida, a GOPfund-raising event and a tour of a laser research facility.</TEXT></DOC>
