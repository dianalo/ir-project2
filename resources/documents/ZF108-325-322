(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>VA Lets Standards Be Guide for SoftwareandM;Just as the Veterans Affairs Department must care for ailing veterans, italso must maintain the health of its large and aging data processing systems.andM;In revamping some older systems, VA combines in-house software developmentand customization with commercial software.andP;  Although that warrants automatedassistance from computer-aided software engineering (CASE) technology, agencyofficials seem to concentrate more on standards than on CASE as a guidingprinciple.andM;VA uses some CASE tools in software development.andM;Adherence to standards, particularly federal ones, &quot;is the thing that'sfacilitating our development,&quot; said David Van Hooser, director of VA'sMedical Information Resources Management Office.andM;&quot;We need more BASE [brain-aided software engineering] in addition to CASE,&quot;said Vidal Falcon, project manager for the Personnel Accounting andIntegrated Data (PAID) redesign project, a major in-house payroll/personnelsystem development effort.andM;The issue is not really technical.andM;&quot;It's a question of interoperability, Van Hooser said.andP;  &quot;We have systems thathave been here since the 1960s that we depend on very much.andP;  As we introducenew systems, we must make sure they communicate with the older ones until wecan replace them.&quot;andM;Taking slightly different approaches in each area, the department isrevamping its payroll/personnel, financial management/accounting, and supplyand logistics systems, at the same time it enhances its DecentralizedHospital Computer Program.andP;  Officials say they rely on adherence to standardsand, to a lesser degree, CASE to integrate these systems at both thetechnological and the programmatic levels.andM;&quot;I think what's going to happen is that the coupling between those systems isgoing to become tighter,&quot; said Robert Bevilacqua, project manager for VA'sFinancial Management System.andM;&quot;In addition to passing transaction data to the central system, there wouldbe a flow going back for the financial managers and the supply people at themedical facilities.&quot;andM;VA's most recent development effort, the Integrated Supply Management System(ISMS), will replace systems that are nearly 20 years old, said H. RobertSaldivar, deputy assistant secretary for acquisition and material management.andM;Although VA has a history of custom-building its systems with both in-houseand contract personnel, ISMS is based on commercial off-the-shelf softwarewith a heavy CASE emphasis.andP;  In January, the department hired Arthur Andersenandamp; Co. of Chicago to develop ISMS and specified CASE technology in the requestfor proposals, said ISMS project manager Edward Kinney.andM;The CASE environment includes Andersen's Design/1 tool with the company'sMethod/1 CASE methodology.andP;  Andersen will use other packaged softwareproducts as well, Kinney said.andP;  ISMS will undergo 13 phases before completionin early 1992.andM;Kinney said &quot;appropriate use of standards and protocols&quot; will be the guidingprinciple in the ISMS project.andM;&quot;We plan to use the [American National Standards Institute's] X12 standardsfor electronic data interchange, CASE for software maintenance savings, andopen systems standards to ensure software portability,&quot; he said.andM;Adherence to standards also has helped the Decentralized Hospital ComputerProgram (DHCP), used at 169 of the VA's 172 hospitals.andP;  DHCP employs theMUMPS medical MIS programming language developed at Massachusetts GeneralHospital.andP;  It runs on Digital Equipment Corp.andP;  PDP-11 and VAX computers.andM;Van Hooser said DHCP adheres to federal MUMPS Standards, VA's standard dataelement dictionary and VA's kernel of automated MUMPS-based tools.andM;MUMPS also will underlie the Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE), acomponent of DHCP now under development.andP;  AMIE will let veterans BenefitsAdministration regional offices exchange admissions information withhospitals.andM;On the financial management and payroll/personnel fronts, VA combinesoff-the-shelf software with in-house development.andM;The FMS system is being developed with the Federal Financial System packagefrom American Management Systems Inc., Arlington, Va.andP;  However, the PAIDredesign is a custom in-house effort.andP;  The payroll application runs on anAmdahl Corp. mainframe computer at the VA data processing center in Austin,Texas.andM;The PAID team has been using CASE to restructure nearly 1 million lines ofold COBOL and other code.andM;The tool set includes software re-engineering tools from Peat, Marwick, Mainand Co., chicago; the APS Development Center application generator from SageSoftware Inc., Rockville, Md.; DesignAid from Nastec Corp., Southfield,Mich.; and tools from the General Services Administration's ProgrammersWorkbench.andM;The two-year PAID re-engineering will be complete by this summer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
