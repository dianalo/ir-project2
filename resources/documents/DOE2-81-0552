Lung cancer is fatal inabout 90% of the cases and therefore in assessing radon exposures itis pertinent to make a comparison in terms of mortality figures. Thereis a broad range of estimates for the U.S. lung cancer mortality fromindoor radon, extending from well below 5,000 to above 20,000 per year.For simplicity in making comparisons, the authors use an intermediateestimate of 10,000 per year, although one needs to bear in mind thisnumber is uncertain. Given approximately 480,000 fatal cancers in theUnited States per year and 136,000 fatal lung cancers, this estimatecorresponds to indoor radon being responsible for 2% of all cancer mortalityand 7% of lung cancer mortality. It is estimated that 83% of lung cancersare due to smoking, corresponding to about 113,000 deaths per year. Overall,therefore, smoking is far more important than indoor radon as a causeof lung cancer. Despite the authors' concentration on it, radon is arelatively small contributor in the perspective of cancer as a wholeor even of lung cancer alone. It is a more dominant contributor in consideringaverage exposures to ionizing radiation.</TEXT></DOC>
