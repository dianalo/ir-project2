(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Gina SmithandM;and Diane BernardandM;Microsoft Corp. will arm future versions of OS/2 Presentation Manager withsophisticated font technology in an effort to put PC-based design on equalground with the Macintosh.andM;The addition of Agfa Compugraphic Division's Intellifont &quot;outline&quot; fonttechnology will give OS/2 users true what-you-see-is-what-you-get displays,providing an exact match between how their fonts appear on-screen and howthey appear in print, sources close to the company said last week.andM;The inclusion of the font technology in Presentation Manager (PM), whichMicrosoft is expected to announce as early as next month, also will allow PMapplications to display sophisticated fonts usually accessible only throughthird-party type houses.andP;  The technology will let users rotate and scalefonts on-screen, and allow applications to share a single typeface library,the sources said.andM;Officials at Microsoft Corp. in Redmond, Wash., and at Agfa Compugraphic inWilmington, Mass., declined to disclose details.andM;&quot;We're looking at enhancing the output capabilities of PM -- and of Windows,for that matter -- but it's too early for us to mention our plans now,&quot; saidMicrosoft spokesman Marty Taucher.andM;When OS/2 2.0 is released next year, PM's two existing fonts will have beenreplaced with 12 outline typefaces embedded in the system, sources said,adding that Microsoft will increase that number to 50 typefaces within threemonths of the operating system's release.andM;&quot;This is a very big deal for users, since the two outline fonts now includedwith Presentation Manager are slow and of low quality,&quot; added one developerwho asked not to be identified.andP;  &quot;Also, this will save users a lot of money,since buying outline fonts [from third-party vendors] is very, veryexpensive.&quot;andM;Sources expect Microsoft to ship the font technology with its OS/2 2.0Software Development Kit, due later this year.andP;  While users will be able toaccess the new fonts from existing applications, the kit will allowdevelopers to incorporate the fonts directly into their applications, thesources said.andM;Outline font technology, popularized by Adobe Systems Inc. in its PostScriptpage-description language for printers, uses the outline of a letter todefine it, rather than all the pixels used to render the letter.andP;  Becauseoutline fonts are composed of lines and curves rather than bit maps, userscan manipulate their size and position on a document or page withoutdistorting their proportions on-screen or in print.andM;Presentation Manager currently does not perform &quot;hinting&quot; on outline fonts, atechnique which ensures that characters are accurately transmitted from PM tothe monitor or printer.andM;The Intellifont &quot;rasterizer&quot; -- code that performs the actual rendering of afont on an output device -- supports hinting and other advanced functions,the sources said, which will put Presentation Manager on par with AppleComputer Inc.'s 32-bit QuickDraw outline font technology, announced threemonths ago and due next year.andM;Microsoft will incorporate the rasterizer into PM as a Dynamic Link Library,which allows the system to store the rasterizer on disk until it's needed,instead of taking up valuable RAM, the sources explained.andM;If Microsoft publishes the specifications of the Dynamic Link Library, typehouses such as Bitstream Inc. and Adobe will be able to create their own typelibraries and rasterizer, which they could then market as a DLL toapplications developers, sources said.andM;&quot;The addition of quality outline fonts to PM will make it a viable competitorwith the Macintosh, whose system-based fonts have always exceeded PC-basedsystems in interoperability and ease of use,&quot; said one source familiar withthe project.andM;Sophisticated fonts are critical to Presentation Manager's success, manyusers said.andM;&quot;The system fonts within PM are grossly inadequate,&quot; said one user who askedto remain unidentified.andP;  &quot;If Microsoft does not [add better font technology]to PM, we'd have serious questions about whether we should go to the Mac.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
