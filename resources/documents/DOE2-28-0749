The cations, calcium, magnesium, sodiumand potassium may replace each other on the soil exchange complex butcalcium and magnesium are most important in this regard. Sodium is objectionablebecause of its harmful effect on soil. Among the anions, chloride isleast desirable bacause of its ease of accumulation and lethal effectsalthough critical concentration varies among plant species. A tentativecategorization of trees, shrubs, grasses and forage on the basis of salttolerance is given. Salt composition is as important a factor as saltconcentration in the management of saline drilling wastes. 14 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
