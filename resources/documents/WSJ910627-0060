Bond Investors Association, a Florida nonprofit group andnewsletter publisher, teams up with Capital GuarantyInsurance to insure small holdings of &quot;old&quot; munis. About 30%of all new issues sold are insured. But normally only bigportfolios of old issues qualify for insurance. The new planwill cover holdings as small as $5,000 for $5 per $1,000 ofprincipal. Capital Guaranty has the final say on issues,though. And even the bond investor group says it is cheaperfor new investors to buy insured muni issues.</LP><TEXT>   Small holder insurance has been tried before and beendropped by insurers, partly because of the cost of analyzingall those little issues. The Capital plan ties into BIA'srating data base. Does it make sense to buy? Maybe, for someinvestors petrified about principal loss, says RichardCiccarone, head of fixed-income research, Kemper Securities.But he warns that since only highly rated issues qualify, theadded cost may not be justified: &quot;It can be too much `beltand suspenders'.&quot;   In a test, Florida investors sought insurance on New Yorkand Massachusetts bonds the insurer didn't cover.                                                                                                          PARADING: Many July Fourth fetes miss the date but go forthe Gulf glory.   Even the poorest towns drum up support. Detroit hasn't hada big military parade since 1950, but it will this year -- onJune 28 (plus a July 4 do). Pittsburgh, Dallas, Little Rock,Ark., and Norwalk, Conn., also plan Gulf events, but not onthe Fourth. David Glamm of the Arkansas veterans officemarvels at the prices for East Coast parades. He adds: &quot;Ourbiggest cost is for something like porta-potties.&quot; LittleRock drew $10,000 in gifts for its July 6 parade.   Pittsburgh expects to save some $20,000 in overtime byholding festivities on July 3. Costly fireworks find sponsorseager to share the sparkle. Cablevision Systems Corp. footsthe $55,000 bill for a Uniondale, N.Y., show. In Pittsburgh,rock radio station WDVE joins local businesses in paying forSteel City's $50,000 display. More broadcast glory: For thefirst time in its 15 years, Macy's fireworks fest in New Yorkwill be beamed out to 100 TV stations.                                                                                                          TEACH A TEACHER: Corporate giving focuses on creating newprograms.   Firms use money to reshape schools of education in stateswhere Randamp;D suffers, says Craig Smith, editor of CorporatePhilanthropy Report in Seattle. Metropolitan Life aidsteacher-designed schools and Morgan Stanley fosters computerliteracy through Classroom Inc.-joint projects with TeachersCollege at Columbia. An urban Peace Corps program alsoprospers.   Many companies are still thinking in &quot;adopt-a-school&quot;terms, says Joe Taller, head of giving at Boeing. &quot;We'retaking more of a systems approach,&quot; he adds. The aerospaceconcern marks its third year of a $1 million funding for theAcademy for the Teaching Professions at Seattle's RainierBeach High School and plans to extend that support at leastanother year. It also backs a professorship at the Universityof Washington to foster math and science.   Many schools view firms &quot;as allies to circumvent their ownstate bureaucracies,&quot; says Mr. Smith.                                                                                                          LOW ON PAPER: A sluggish first quarter for printers cuttheir paper inventories to a nine-year low, says the NationalAssociation of Printers and Lithographers. It says big paperstocks are a luxury printers haven't been able to afford forsome time.                                                                                                          FIRST-CLASS CUTUPS: The Association of Flight Attendantsnewsletter pokes fun at a UAL field services executive forsuggesting that crew members use their Swiss Army Knives tocarve the roast if first-class chef's tools are left behind.A UAL spokesman says the remark was taken out of context andwas intended to encourage flexibility.                                                                                                          BLACK HATS WIN. Chicago White Sox caps go to black fromroyal blue, and sales jump tenfold to 200,000 this year, saysStarter Sportswear, a New Haven, Conn., baseball apparellicensee. It says ebony items will account for $40 million,about half of its team-logo clothing sales this year.                                                                                                          SOFTWARE REPOS: Getting back by hacking draws vendor anduser criticism.   Last year, Silicon Valley software maker Logisticondisabled Revlon computer programs (thus freezing shippingoperations), charging the cosmetic maker didn't pay for itssoftware. A Revlon lawsuit has since been settled out ofcourt. But the squabble raised legal and ethical questions ina field in which vendors can zap via phone lines. &quot;It's notreally a software problem, it's a contract problem,&quot; says DomGualtieri of Foxware in Massachusetts.   &quot;Drop-dead&quot; devices built into software that can bedetonated by vendors are common and tough to detect, saysDistribution magazine. &quot;There are a lot of little scufflesevery day, but you don't hear about them,&quot; says themagazine's Jay Gordon. John Woolsoncraft of AndersenConsulting in Chicago notes a &quot;relationship breach&quot; in theRevlon episode that &quot;makes everyone nervous.&quot;   But Robert P. Burkey of Analysis Inc. says &quot;problems canbe ironed out&quot; through respect -- and a good contract.
