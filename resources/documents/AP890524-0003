Now the ambitious young producer hopes to inspire jaded Japanesewith the tragedy of an idealistic rebellion in 1936 which tried toinstall a military government under the late Emperor Hirohito.   Okayama's problem in making the film, due for release June 17,has been that the attempted coup by 22 fervent young right-wingmilitary officers was quashed under orders of Hirohito himself, whowas then revered as a living god.   The emperor isn't portrayed in the film, but his order againstthe young rebels, whom Okuyama describes as martyrs, is depicted asa misjudgment that ultimately led Japan into World War II, theproducer said.   Reflections on the emperor's judgment and the question of hisresponsibility for the war are acutely sensitive here, althoughdiscussion of Hirohito's historical role has become freer since hisdeath Jan. 7 at age 87.   Historians generally agree Hirohito was a figurehead, wieldinglittle real power. His most famous decision was Japan's World WarII surrender in 1945, when the government was deadlocked over theissue.   But Hirohito also ordered the 1936 leaders of the coup back totheir barracks after two days of assassinations and politicalturmoil in the ``2-26 Incident,'' so called because it was launchedon Feb. 26.   Several coup leaders committed suicide, and others wereimprisoned. On July 12, 1936, two civilians and 13 of the rebelofficers were executed by firing squad.   Okuyama's movie, ``2-26'' tells the story of the young officerswho led about 1,500 soldiers and nine civilians in a bloody attemptto overthrow the government and install a military regime underHirohito.   The rebels claimed they sought to restore integrity to a nationthey believed was corrupted by a political elite living in luxurywhile millions suffered Depression-era deprivation. Many of therebels, historians say, were sons of poor farm families who hadsuffered hunger and seen their sisters sold into prostitution.   But in the repressive atmosphere after the failed coup, anopposing faction in the military used the incident to build its ownpower, eventually establishing a militaristic regime that led Japaninto World War II.   ``There was an energy and an intensity alive then that has beenforgotten in today's Japan,'' the 35-year-old producer said.   ``One main reason I wanted to produce this film is because welive in a similar era, when young women prostitute themselves andrevelations of political corruption surface every day,'' saidOkuyama. ``The only difference is that then we were poor and nowwe're rich.''   The film is coming out amid outrage over a scandal in which 14prominent bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested onsuspicion of bribery and other illegalities, and more than 150people embarrassed by disclosures that they accepted unlistedshares at discount prices from an employment information firm.   ``I wanted to sound an alarm, to use the tragedy and drama ofthe 2-26 incident to tell people what they don't want to hear aboutpolitical corruption and decay,'' Okuyama said.   ``Influential people are gathering dirty money. Like the martyrsof 2-26, people should care.''   The film depicts the deaths of the coup leaders as a tragic lossof courageous young men who died still true to their ideals.   ``Even though the emperor doesn't understand that we were right,history will answer for us,'' says one coup leader before putting abullet in his head.   Okuyama said in an interview that he knew a decade ago thatthere was material to make a good movie, but it just wasn'tpossible because of a lack of funds, and sensitivities about theemperor.   The screenwriter didn't want to get involved, he said, but``finally agreed on the condition we play down politics and aim themovie more toward young people.''   Corporate backers also feared a backlash from right-wing groupsthat vociferously protest anything they interpret as disrespectfultoward the imperial family.   ``When we get to the last print, just before distribution, weplan to show the film to some of the major right-wing groups to tryto gain their understanding,'' Okuyama said.   But he still expects some trouble. ``Actually, I'm very worriedjust now, very afraid. But even if there's controversy, I think Ican explain what we're trying to do.''   The film ends on a note the rightists should appreciate: a clashof gongs and ``Tenno Heika Banzai,'' or ``Long Live the Emperor.''</TEXT></DOC>
