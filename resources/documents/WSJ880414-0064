Responding to wire-service reports about the expected indictments for tax fraud, the lawyers issued a statement saying the couple has paid more than $250 million in taxes in the past five years and calling the yet-to-be-announced allegations &quot;completely groundless and grossly unfair.&quot;    The Helmsleys plan to fight the charges. The Helmsleys &quot;have paid more taxes to the government over the years than practically any other individual in this city or country,&quot; the attorneys said.    A spokeswoman for the New York state attorney general's office said she was &quot;constrained by the law&quot; and couldn't confirm or deny that an indictment had been handed up until the subjects of the charges had been brought into custody.    But she said she expects to have an announcement for reporters this morning. The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan didn't return calls seeking comment.    The Helmsleys are believed to have been the subject of a yearlong investigation into whether money was diverted from the couple's hotel chain and offices to pay for renovation of their Greenwich, Conn., estate, with resulting expenses written off as business expenses. </TEXT></DOC>
