The publisher of children's books and magazines is tryingfor the second time in 15 months to go public, planning tooffer 4.3 million common shares for the company andshareholders at between $18 and $21 a share. The terms aresimilar to those of an aborted offering in September 1990,which had been seen as a test of how high a price a favorablyviewed company could command in a weakened IPO market.</LP><TEXT>   At the time of the postponement, Richard Robinson,chairman, chief executive officer and president, said it wasbest not to proceed with the offering, given the volatilityof the market.   But times have changed. &quot;It's like night and day,&quot; saysRobert Natale, an analyst for Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. In late1990, battered by a weak economy and concerns over thePersian Gulf crisis, &quot;the new-issues market had completelydried up,&quot; he said. Now, demand for new issues is very strongand investors have begun to take a new interest in publishingstocks.   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Scholasticsaid 3,250,000 shares would be sold by the company and1,050,000 by shareholders, including relatives of founderMaurice Robinson.   The offering would increase common shares outstanding to10.2 million and would value the company as high as $214million. About 9.6 million shares of the total would becommon stock and the remainder Class A voting shares.   If this attempt flies, new investors would be paying asmuch as 13 times the original investment of existingshareholders, who shelled out an average of $1.60 a sharejust four years ago when Scholastic went private in aleveraged buy-out led by Richard Robinson that valued thecompany at about $100 million.   The company, which has operations in the U.S., Canada,United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, appears to havefared well since it went private. Most of its business is inchildrens' books, which grew 21% in the year ended in May.   That year, earnings jumped to $13.8 million on revenue of$422.9 million from $2.8 million on revenue of $374.6 millionthe year before. Net interest expense, meanwhile, totaled$13.7 million in fiscal 1991 and $14.3 million in fiscal1990.   In the first half of this fiscal year, revenue rose to$228 million from $200.6 million, although net slipped to$4.7 million from $5.1 million because of a $2.5 millionnonrecurring charge related to a planned relocation of itsNew York headquarters.   The offering would reduce the existing shareholders' staketo 68.1%. Richard Robinson, a son of Maurice, plans to sell256,000 shares, reducing his holding of common stock to about1.9 million shares.   But most of the voting power would still rest with RichardRobinson and two trusts controlled by Maurice Robinson'sdescendants, who control 95% of the 562,100 Class A votingshares. The prospectus states that common stock holders willbe able to elect one-fifth of the board.   Scholastic plans to use the money from its share of thesale, which could be as much as $67.2 million, to redeem$54.7 million in subordinated and junior subordinateddebentures. It's debt stood at $114.8 million at the end ofNovember. It hasn't paid dividends since 1986 and has noplans to pay dividends on its common stock or Class A stock,the prospectus said.   It added that 3.4 million shares will be sold in the U.S.and 900,000 overseas. The underwriters of the offering areGoldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc. The companyis seeking a listing in the National Market System of theover-the-counter market.</TEXT></DOC>
