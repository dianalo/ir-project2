Torras Hostench S.A., the Spanish company controlled by the Kuwait Investment Office, in March launched a successful 25 billion peseta ($30.5 billion) takeover bid for Spain's largest sugar refiner, Ebro Cia. A month later, Italian financier Carlo de Benedetti acquired a 21.5% stake in Hermanos Pascual, S.A., a leading Spanish exporter of fruits and vegetables, for 3.3 billion pesetas.    Analysts estimate that more than 50% of Spain's food sector is controlled by foreigners. The 1,400 small family-run companies in the sector are easy targets for foreigners, as tougher sanitary and fiscal regulations threaten these firms's survival.    But some Spanish food companies are standing up to the competition. The family-run Conservera Campofrio, S.A., Spain's leading producer of processed meats, has fought to maintain its independence.    After months of arduous negotiations, Campofrio last year bought back for $90 million the 50% of its share capital held by Reginald Lewis's TLC Group Inc. The stake had been acquired in 1978 by the international foods division of Beatrice Inc., the leading U.S. food group, and then sold to Wall Street buy-out specialist Kolberg, Kravis, Roberts andamp; Co., who then passed it on to TLC in 1987.    The buy-back accord was hailed by Spain's business community as a sign that Spanish companies, about 80% of which are family owned, are able to withstand European Community membership without being taken over by giant foreign concerns.    With sales of 30 billion pesetas, Campofrio has embarked on an ambitious plan to penetrate markets in Europe, the U.S. and Latin America.    &quot;We are trying to position ourselves in these three markets before 1989 when the ban is lifted on Spanish pork, which can't be exported now . . .,&quot; said Pedro Ballve, the company's 35-year-old chairman who inherited the company when his father died in 1985.    To buy back the shares from TLC, &quot;we went into debt up to our ears and put up everything we owned as collateral,&quot; said Fernando Ballve, Mr. Pedro's 32-year-old brother and a member of Campofrio's board.    The brothers, who represent a new generation of Spanish businessmen, used a loan from Banco Central to buy back Campofrio shares from TLC. In April, Banco Central purchased 40% of the Spanish food company, liquidating the Ballve's debt. The bank pledged not to sell any of its stake without Campofrio's consent.    Banco Central is now the lead manager in the private placement of 10% of Campofrio's share capital, which is expected to raise 6.45 billion pesetas.    The offering, from July 8-25, is managed by Shearson Lehman Hutton and coled by Spanish brokerage Iberagentes.    But demand from primary dealers for Campofrio shares totaled 12 billion pesetas, or 20% of the company's capital, while roughly 20% of the demand came from abroad, underscoring the growing foreign demand for solid Spanish companies, said Iberagentes managing director Aldo Olcese.    The Ballve family acquired 3% of Banco Central for 16 billion pesetas to become the bank's largest shareholder after Cartera Central, the joint venture owned by the Kuwait Investment Office and the Spanish construction tycoons Alberto Alcocer and Alberto Cortina. Pedro Ballve was given a seat on the bank's board.    Family-owned companies have shied away from Spain's stock exchanges, which are notoriously narrow. &quot;We need more companies like Campofrio to broaden and modernize Spain's stock exchanges,&quot; said Mr. Olcese.    Campofrio is likely to offer another 10% of its share capital on the Spanish markets by year end. It also plans to seek a listing on the London or New York stock exchanges, he said.    With 10% of Spain's market for meat products, Campofrio's sales are double those of its closest competitor, Industrias Revillas, which was acquired for nine billion pesetas by the Anglo-Dutch food group Unilever in December 1986.    Campofrio posted 1987 profit of 2.47 billion pesetas, up from 1.32 billion pesetas the year before. It expects its net to surge to 3.24 billion pesetas in 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
