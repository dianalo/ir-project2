For purpose of analysis, these interpretationscan be grouped into two different approaches. The full-sovereignty proponentsbase their position in a near-absolute conception of sovereign power.The rules of law binding upon states therefore emanate from their freewill. Supporters of the limited-sovereignty approach contend that thesovereignty of a state in the international context is inherently limitedby customary norms of international law, irrespectively of that state'sconsent. By employing these two concepts of sovereignty, a comparativestudy is made between United States and Chine (PRC) regarding the lawof the sea. The study centers on some related questions. In terms ofthe principle of state sovereignty, do both the U.S. and China adoptthe same concept of sovereignty? In what ways and to what extent areconcerns with sovereign rights reflected in both countries' views ofthe law of the sea issues? The significance of the findings shows thatboth countries espouse full sovereignty approach in four key issue areas:territorial sea, exclusive economic zone, continental shelf, and deep-seabedmining.</TEXT></DOC>
