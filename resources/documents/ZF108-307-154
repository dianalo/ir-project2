 Which means anywherethat you are, within at least much of the world, you may access whatever dataservices and image services you need.andM;Q: What technological advances will make this level of service feasible inthe relatively short time-span that you've described?andM;A: The introduction of photonics into the long-distance network has given usglobal digital connectivity at high rates, and that's just a phenomenalthing.andP;  Intercity fibers have given us enormous transmission capacity, so youcan carry very broadband signals.andM;So, there is broadband potential in the network.andP;  There are also costimplications, because if you can carry a bit cheaper, then you can carry morebits for the same money.andP;  All this was a necessary requisite for the vision Italked about earlier--to have connectivity, at enormous bit rates, availablearound the globe.andP;  Photonics and light guides have essentially done that.andM;Q: Are some key technologies improving at a less dramatic rate?andM;A: Software has been the bottleneck technology, because it's been donelargely by people and if you want more software you hire more people.andP;  That'sbeginning to yield.andP;  We're beginning to see--particularly through reuse ofcode, standard software components and software engineering tools--theopportunity to generate better software and do it at higher levels ofproductivity.andM;Q: What kinds of code are yielding to productivity improvements?andM;A: The mainstream of the effort has been for code which runs on standardcomputing environments, where you are less tied to a wide range of uniqueperipherals.andP;  It's much tougher for us to increase the productivity ofsoftware in a switching machine that operates in real time, where you justcan't have outages from a design point of view.andM;Q: What new directions in data communications can we expect in the next fewdecades?andM;A: If you look at the way society is evolving and look at the needs to meetthat evolution, there's really been no redirection, technology or marketdriven.andP;  This has consistently appeared to be the case for almost a decade,and the things that have happened substantiate the vision that we willeventually provide people with any combination of services at any location.andM;Q: How is it that the communications industry expects to follow such aconsistent course?andM;A: I think that's the case because the technology is evolving in a ratherpredictable way.andP;  A lot of new product was technically feasible a long timeago, but has only now entered the realm of economic feasibility because ofprogress in technology -- particularly in silicon chip technology.andM;A silicon chip can be manufactured eventually down to the point where eachtrasistor is about 400 atoms by 400 atoms before the bulk effect phenomenonbegins to get into some statistical difficulty.andP;  That means that there arehundreds of millions or maybe a billion transistors you can put on a chip.andM;If you take the rapid rate of progress that's been occurring since the 1960s,which currently is doubling the number of components per chip about every 18months, and calculate how long it will take to get that limit, you concludethat it's about a decade off.andM;Q: What other key technologies are following a similarly predictable course?andM;A: The other technology that seems to be even more powerful in the long termis photonic technology, based on lasers, fiber guides and other opticaldevices.andP;  One can do a similar calculation to the one I outlined for siliconchips and conclude that today's most advanced lightwave systems have reachedabout one-tenth of 1% of the potential for the technology.andP;  If you take therate of progress, which is exponential, and extrapolate it to the limit yousee, there is another 20 years of rapid progress in the lightwavetransmission business.andM;Q: What advances will we see in data communications as photonic technologymoves toward this theoretical limit?andM;A: We have photonic systems, but we don't have photonic control.andP;  We don'thave control of photons with photons in the way that the vacuum tube gave uscontrol of electrons with electrons.andP;  That's just coming now to the opticalamplifier, and the research community around the world is very excited aboutthe feasibility of optical interfaces.andM;What that does is open up the domain of photonic control and thereforephotonic switching for voice, data and image communications.andP;  I think towardthe end of the decade it will open up reasonably powerful photonic computers,which in turn will be another source of data.andM;Q: What effect will the advent of photonics have on existing technologies?andM;A: We don't know yet where photonic computers are going to find applicationand how they will compete with electronic computers, but my guess is thatthere is going to be room for both--that photonic computing is going to openup a whole new dimension of computing, rather than simply displace theelectronic computers.andM;If you are counting beans, if you're working arithmetic, if you're keepingtrack of numbers, electrons are pretty good at that.andP;  It's [electroniccomputers] based on binary numbers, so [for] the things that arenumbers--putting out paychecks or tracking costs--the electronic computer ispretty powerful, and it's not clear that you're going to displace thosefunctions.andM;But look at where electronic computers do things poorly, or at least dothings less well, and I think you immediately run into places where today'scomputer can barely handle the problems we have to handle.andP;  Or alternatively,we don't have a lot of those functions because the cost is too high.andM;Q: What applications are suited to photonic technology?andM;A: Probably the best example of that is the area of pattern recognition andprocessing of complex signals.andP;  My feeling is that the earliest photoniccomputers will, because of the nature of our thinking, try to emulateelectronic machines and probably will try to add numbers and things likethat, but that's not the mainstream [application for photonic computers].andO;You will find as we push in that direction that what these patterns of lightreally do is correlate images, recognize patterns and do the kinds of thingsthat today humans do well, but electronic computers do poorly.andP;  I wouldinclude speech recognition in that.andM;We are getting to the point where you can have a limited vocabulary speechrecognizer on a few chips of silicon and maybe in a few years on one chip ofsilicon, but there is a lot of computing going on in there, a lot of digitsbeing kicked around.andP;  The photonic computer of the late 1990s or early nextcentury might do that function much more elegantly and be based on algorithmsthat aren't so much driven by what machines can do.andP;  Photonic computers maygenerate a different set of algorithms.andM;Q: What benefits can users expect from these new computers and algorithms?andM;A: With electronic machines, we have in many cases automated essentially allof the information-processing functions, and you find that what the human isoften doing is recognizing what is being demanded of the system andtranslating [that] into an input to the computer or information system.andM;For example, the airline reservation system has an enormous amount of dataprocessing behind it.andP;  What's not automated is how a customer interfaces[with] that data processing.andP;  What these new technologies have to do isprovide the interface between a customer and the airline reservation system,in this case.andP;  Computers can allow that to happen automatically if they canrecognize patterns, in this case speech patterns.andM;If you look at the productivity improvement that comes out of today's airlinesystems, it's got to be enormous compared to trying to do the whole thingmanually.andP;  If you look at this next level of technology, which can do theinputting and outputting and translation functions, it's an equally dramaticincrease in productivity.andM;Q: How soon will we see fiber in homes and offices?andM;A: I don't think that technology is going to drive that timeline.andP;  I thinkbusiness is going to drive it.andP;  I am very hopeful that we can provide atechnology, which for many homes, not all, but for many homes, would allowfiber and associated electronic technologies to be delivered at costscomparable to copper in just a couple of years.andM;The technology window is now opening, and within a couple years it will bemore than just a slight crack.andP;  The economic opportunity is there; now wehave to deal with how much opportunity is there going to be in newconstruction and when will those volumes build so that the impact of thevolume further diminishes costs.andM;Q: What changes in the way we conduct business and other aspects of our liveswill occur as a result of improved data communication services?andM;A: If you go back to the introduction of the telephone or data processing andlook at today's environment, I think you get a pretty clear picture that itisn't just a matter of delivering new technologies and new capabilities intoan existing society.andP;  What it's all about is delivering new technology andnew capabilities into a society which evolves to make use of thetechnologies.andM;So, if you look at something like ISDN, integrated services digital network,it's not as simple as just putting an ISDN terminal on my desk.andP;  Sure, I willhave an enhanced capability, but it's modest compared to the potential.andP;  Thevalue of that technology enhances dramatically as I change the way I dobusiness.andM;The office has to change, the way I do business has to change, the way Iinteract with people has to change.andP;  In short, society has to change.andP;  Itdoesn't have to change to meet ISDN, it has to change to be more efficient,to be more competitive, to make life more enjoyable, ISDN is one of the waysin which that can happen.andM;Q: Businesses have failed to realize the full potential of existingtechnologies like ISDN because people resist change.andP;  How can we expect thedramatic changes in behavior needed to take advantage of emergingtechnologies?andM;A: As the technology evolves, I think the process is made.andP;  In the earlytelephone days, business was served by messenger boys.andP;  It was quite atransition from an organization served by messenger boys to an organizationthat had a few telephones.andP;  I can imagine a fair amount of debate about that.andM;You cannot lay down solutions for the year 2000 today and match theenvironment.andP;  It isn't that I don't want to change, although there is aflavor of that, but it is that the change takes time.andP;  How could you lay downthe definitive PBX in an office of the early 1900s and take off the next dayusing it the way we use it today?andM;One reason facsimile is enjoying such tremendous popularity is that it's ahybrid technology.andP;  It sort of bridges the old fashioned way of working withthe new world of data communications.andP;  But, [at the same time] it has a greatweakness because it doesn't have all the operations support capability or allof the software potential behind it.andP;  Therefore, I would expect over time itwill yield to more direct data-to-data communications.andM;Q: Should this human side of new technologies be an issue for researchers?andM;A: I think what it says for Bell Laboratories is: one, that we have to evolvethe technologies; two, that we have to design products that recognize theorderly transition of society to the new environment; and three, which is apart of that, that we've got to make these systems a lot more user friendly.andM;If you take plain old telephone service and look at the power commanded bythe individual, what you find is that a seven-year-old child really commandsa global network involving tens of billions of dollars of resources in aprocess that can be learned in short order.andP;  When it comes to data and imageand more complex services, it is much more difficult.andP;  A seven-year-old childcannot come in and get the power of the network delivered.andM;Q: What technologies are emerging that will make datacommunications easierfor the user?andM;A:  We look at things like automatic voice recognition and automatic voicegeneration--systems that essentially take information, process it byrecognizing words and then deliver voice out.andP;  Image processing is the sameway.andP;  Both [are] important threads of the technology.andP;  Though the applicationof those processing techniques is broad, one of the important aspects ismaking the system's power available to users in a way that does not requireenormous training and an enormous amount of sophistication.andM;Q: How soon can we expect significant user demand for the higher speeds thatemerging technology is making available?andM;A: Systems will provide enormous bit capability, 100 or 150 megabit, and willget increasing connectivity at that level.andP;  I think we are already seeing theemergence of a demand of 45 megabits-- the DS-3 rate.andP;  We hace in thiscountry 300,000 ISDN lines.andP;  That's all come within a few years.andP;  It's notquite as many as a lot of the suppliers would like to see, but it's still animpressive number.andM;The think that would really open up high speed, of course, is some ubiquitousvideo service.andP;  If there was a resurgence of the picture phone, or if homevideo services became substantial, then you would really see an enormouseconomic driver on the high speed.andM;Q: What changes are coming in the 1990s that will prevent the softwareproblems that plagued ATandamp;T in January?andM;A: It's just a natural part of our process evolution and our productevolution and our quality initiative to bring many forces to bear inpreventing that kind of a problem.andP;  What happened had to do with the factthat after an enormous amount of effort and design of software--all of theaudits that we go through during software development, all of the simulationsthat we go through in software development, all of the testing in the lab,and after a month of infield service with no indication of problem--asoftware bug crawled out of its hole, and it caused great agony in thenetwork.andM;We're using a software component kind of approach, proven at the componentlevel.andP;  That technology greatly diminishes the chance that there's some bugin there.andP;  You've maybe used the software before or you have automaticallytested it against some computer requirements.andP;  You can surround this processwith much more logic and processing power and therefore chase down more ofthe bugs and never put in as many bugs in the original process.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
