These analysts base their cautious forecasts on a firmer dollar and technical factors, and they say these twin pillars should prop up investor confidence, which was shaken badly by the crash of last October.    &quot;We see two positive factors at work in the (German) stock market: the market is oversold, and the dollar is strengthening,&quot; says Ernst Drayss, head of research for Deutsche Bank AG in Frankfurt.    John Legat, a fund manager for London-based GT Management PLC, agrees. &quot;The German stock market has been in a downtrend for the past 18 months,&quot; he says, stressing that German stock prices have fallen so low, they've become very cheap by world-wide standards.    &quot;The ratio between a company's share price and its cash flow in the German companies that I follow is just under 3.0, while it's much higher in other countries,&quot; he says.    Chart analysts at the Berliner Handelsund Frankfurter Bank (BHF) say their technical price charts signal that the stock market in West Germany is ripe for a turnaround.    &quot;Our charts are calling for a rally,&quot; says one chartist, &quot;but this market is too dependent on the dollar.&quot; He adds that &quot;now it's a question of investor confidence in a firm dollar.&quot;    Mr. Legat believes the dollar already has hit bottom. If the dollar gets stronger, &quot;I think there's going to be a rally in the first quarter,&quot; he adds.    A large share of West German corporate earnings comes from U.S. operations, and about 10% of German exports go to the U.S. So those German companies that have heavy dollar exposure, such as auto manufacturers and chemical companies, should see their profits rise if the dollar stabilizes at current levels or climbs.    That, in turn, would make their shares more attractive. Most analysts see German car makers, such as Daimler-Benz AG and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG profiting sooner than other sectors from a higher dollar.    Daimler's sales in the U.S., the company's chief export market, fell 9.46% last year, while BMW's sales were also off.    &quot;The German auto sector clearly presents some trading opportunities,&quot; says Gregor Gielen, senior vice president at BHF Securities Corp., a BHF unit in New York.    However, he notes that about 50% of West German exports go to Common Market nations, and dollar fluctuations have less impact on companies that are heavily involved in such trade. He warns that the strong mark may have weakened the West German companies' hold on European markets, allowing cheaper dollar-based exports to cut into their market share.    That is why Mr. Legat likes stocks of German chemical companies. &quot;U.S. chemical manufacturers are straining to meet their domestic demand, so that leaves a lot of room for German chemical companies,&quot; he asserts.    Among stocks he likes are Bayer AG, Hoechst AG and BASF AG, but his favorite in that group is Henkel KGaA.    The West German stock index, as calculated by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, had been zigzagging upward until recently from last year's nadir of 400.13 points registered Nov. 10. It fell 8.72 points Friday to 402.43, but is expected to rise Monday on the strength of U.S. trade figures released after Frankfurt trading ended.    Analysts say the lack of confidence among foreign investors is a major handicap to any rise in stock prices. International investors hold about 50% of readily traded German shares in their portfolios and have been heavy sellers since the stock crash made prospects for West German corporate earnings look as bleak as some forecasts of German economic growth.    West German corporate earnings are expected to decline 1.5% in 1988 after growing only 1% in 1987, according to Ernest Ferriday, a senior European analyst at Morgan Grenfell Securities Internationl Ltd. in London.    Share prices in London were sharply higher at Friday's close after surging ahead during the afternoon in reaction to the release of favorable U.S. trade data for November.    The Financial Times 30-share index was up 38.0 at 1436.7. Volume was 528.6 million shares, well up from 352.2 million shares a day earlier.    The 100-share index was up 43.3 points at 1786.7 at the close, below the day's peak of 1793.6, up 50.2. The index remained in negative territory all morning in very thin trading as participants awaited the trade data and was down 4.4 points just before the release of the figures.    The U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed to $13.22 billion in November from $17.63 billion in October. The average of market expectations had been for a November deficit of $15.4 billion.    West German shares traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange closed mixed with a slightly lower bias before the release of the trade figures. Most investors stayed on the sidelines during the session, brokers said. As a result, no trends were established by the close of trading.    Elsewhere in Europe, share prices rose in Paris, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Madrid; closed mixed in Zurich and Brussels; and fell in Milan.    Paris share prices staged a big rally in hectic trading, following the release of the trade figures. In Amsterdam, stocks staged a spectacular rebound, leaping 5.3% during the final two hours of trading, as investors celebrated the trade news. Other exchanges closed before the numbers came out.    Asian trading also ended before the figures were released. Share prices closed higher in Sydney, Manila, Taipei, Hong Kong and Singapore and were lower in Wellington. The Tokyo market was closed.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                  % This                             Jan 14     Jan 13     Year    U.S. .................... 228.6      228.4   +  0.2    Britain ................. 527.7      524.9   +  6.1    Canada .................. 347.6      348.6   +  4.3    Japan .................. 1065.2     1048.4   + 12.7    France .................. 282.2      280.6   - 30.9    Germany ................. 151.6      150.7   - 41.7    Hong Kong .............. 1700.8     1680.8   -  4.4    Switzerland ............. 138.8      138.3   - 30.9    Australia ............... 247.4      249.5   -  6.2    World index ............. 404.6      402.4   + 13.4</TEXT></DOC>
