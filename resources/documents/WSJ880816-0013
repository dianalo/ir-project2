The Michigan Quarterly Econometric Model projects GNP growth of 3.8% and unemployment of 5.6% for 1988. In June, the model forecast GNP growth of 3.3% and unemployment of 5.7% for 1988.    The group's Consumer Price Index forecast for 1988 rose slightly -- to 4.1% from 3.9% in the June report.    The study cited stronger demand for U.S. goods because of the dollar's declining value. The forecast &quot;has to be characterized as continued, but not especially rapid growth,&quot; the study said. </TEXT></DOC>
