 The forum had become a meeting placefor members of the Inner Circle, a nationwide hacker group that used theTwilight Phone's message base to trade stolen passwords and swap tips onphone phreaking-getting free use of long-distance telephone systems.andM;Cable Pair's visitors that evening were some of the Inner Circle's mostactive members, highly placed in the hacker pecking order.andP;  They had come inresponse to messages that Cable Pair had posted on the board, inviting themto take a guided tour of his headquarters, and they were suitably impressed.andO;Computer equipment was everywhere.andP;  The sysop's console consisted of severalterminals connected to a remote Hewlett-Packard minicomputer.andM;In a back room was a bank of electromechanical telephone switches-old stuff,but enough to run a phone system for a small town.andP;  Cable Pair even had anofficial Bell version of the infamous &quot;blue box,&quot; a device that sends out theprecisely calibrated tones that unlock long-distance telephone circuits.andP;  Todemonstrate the magic box, he keyed in a 2,600-cycle-per-second tone and wasrewarded with the clear whisper of ATandamp;T's long-distance circuit.andM;Then, like jazz players in a jam session, group members took turns showingwhat they could do.andP;  One tapped into ATandamp;T's teleconferencing system.andP;  Anotherbragged about how he once nearly had Ronald Reagan, Queen Elizabeth, and thepope on the same conference call.andM;One hacker's specialty was getting into Arpanet, the advanced researchnetwork that links universities and government agencies, including defenseresearch centers.andP;  &quot;The Wizard of Arpanet sat right there at that keyboardand hacked into the system,&quot; says Cable Pair, smiling at the memory.andP;  &quot;And wecaptured every keystroke.&quot;andM;It was probably Cable Pair's finest hour.andP;  He was not, after all, justanother hacker.andP;  The gathering that evening was the culmination of anelaborate sting operation.andM;Outside the office, FBI agents watched everyone who entered and left thebuilding.andP;  A few months after the jam session, police raided homes across thecountry.andP;  They confiscated computers and disks and charged about a dozenadults and teenagers with various counts of computer abuse and wire fraud.andM;Cable Pair was John Maxfield, whose career as an FBI informant had started ayear earlier.andP;  Now approaching the age of 50, he is still chasing hackers,phone phreaks, and computer pirates.andP;  When his cover was blown in a hackernewsletter soon after the office party, he attracted a network of doubleagents, people who found it more convenient-and safer-to work with him thanagainst him.andP;  Some continue to maintain their status in the hackerunderground and pass information to Maxfield.andM;Spy StoryandM;The nature of Maxfield's calling depends on your frame of reference.andP;  Ifyou've read enough cheap fiction, you might see him as a private dick in adigital overcoat.andP;  Or a stagecoach guard sitting on the strongbox, eyesscanning the horizon, electron gun across his knees.andP;  He refers to the hackerphenomenon in the nebulous language of Cold War espionage, casting himself ina spynovel role as a warrior fighting battles that both sides will deny everhappened.andM;There's something of a CIA-versus-KGB type of professional courtesy in whatpeople in the hacker community say about Maxfield.andM;&quot;He's very good at getting hackers together on one thing,&quot; says Eric Corley,editor of 2600, the hacker publication that fingered Maxfield more than sixyears ago.andP;  &quot;I can think of nothing that hackers agree on except that JohnMaxfield is evil.&quot;andM;Maxfield responds in kind.andP;  &quot;Hackers are like electronic cockroaches,&quot; hesays.andP;  &quot;You can't see them, but they're there, and at night they raid therefrigerator.&quot; Although a lot of hackers are what Maxfield calls&quot;tourists&quot;-young people who go into a system simply because it's there, justto look around-more sinister influences often lurk behind them.andM;&quot;The tourist may go into a system and look around, but when he leaves, he'sgot a password, and he'll share it with others because he's got an ego andwants to show how good he is,&quot; says Maxfield.andM;&quot;It's my experience that every hacker gang has one or more adult members whodirect activities and manipulate the younger ones.andP;  What could be better thanto have these naifs doing your dirty work for you? They can open all thedoors and unlock the systems, and then you go in and steal space-shuttleplans.andM;&quot;The hackers are one step away from the shadow world of the spies,&quot; Maxfieldsays.andP;  &quot;Some have deliberately sought out and made contact with the KGB.&quot;andO;Maxfield wasn't surprised at all when West German police announced in March1988 that they had arrested a group of hackers who used overseas links toU.S.andP;  computer networks to steal sensitive data.andP;  (See &quot;The Cuckoo's Egg,&quot;PC/Computing, September and October 1989.) And he thinks computer companiesand corporations haven't learned much about securing their systems.andP;  &quot;Thereare more interconnections,&quot; he says, &quot;and that leads to more vulnerability.&quot;andM;A good example was the worm that Robert T. Morris, Jr., unleashed in November1988 through the Unix-based Internet research and defense network that shutdown more than 6,000 computers.andM;&quot;The hackers will tell you that this kind of thing is just a practical joke,a harmless prank.andP;  But it can do some very serious damage,&quot; says Maxfield.andO;Computer systems experts who testified at Morris's trial last Januaryestimated that the cost of cleaning up after the chaos wreaked by the Unixworm was $15 million.andM;The information that Maxfield collects about these computer pranksters andcriminals goes into a database that he maintains to help him identify hackersand monitor their activities.andP;  (Though they've tried on more than a fewoccasions, hackers have no chance of breaking into this database-there's nodial-up access to it.) Maxfield tracks the phone phreaks' identities andaliases to help his clients, who are managers at large corporations, creditcard companies, and telephone companies-businesspeople who feel the need toprotect their electronic goods and services.andM;What can Maxfield do for them? If a corporation's phone system is abused byunauthorized users or if its computer system is invaded by hackers, he canconduct an investigation and advise the company on how to contain theproblem.andP;  He can also tell them where their system is vulnerable and what todo about it.andM;Most of the hackers whose names and aliases are in Maxfield's databaseprobably are pranksters, teenagers attracted by the danger and excitement ofelectronic lock-picking.andP;  Their activities would remain mostly benign,Maxfield says, if it weren't for the organized online groups and thecriminally-minded adults that urge them on.andM;&quot;That's the real threat,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;It's not the pranksters so much as thepeople they're associated with.andP;  The people who don't run bulletin boards,who don't brag openly about what they can do.&quot;andM;Young Maxfield Meets the MafiaandM;Maxfield could easily have become one of the hackers be now fights against.andO;As a teenager growing up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in the late 1950s, he had aconsuming passion for telephones and computers.andP;  During the summer he workedfor an independent phone equipment manufacturer and spent time hanging aroundthe offices of Michigan Bell.andP;  He also made some friends within Bell.andM;Naturally curious, Maxfield experimented with his telephone at home andlearned how to blow fuses at distant switching stations and even how to shutdown whole portions of an exchange.andP;  By studying ATandamp;T technical journals usedon his job and by picking up technical information from his contacts at Bell,he learned how to make his own blue box.andP;  In 1961, when direct-dial servicereached Ann Arbor, Maxfield was finally able to test his discovery.andM;Maxfield was shocked when he realized he could make long-distance phone callsfor free.andP;  He called a friend at the phone company, and he mentioned histriumph to other friends.andP;  Maxfield's discovery attracted the attention ofsome people who offered to pay him $350 each for 1,000 blue boxes.andM;Word also got back to ATandamp;T special audit inspectors through the friend atMichigan Bell.andP;  After paying Maxfield a visit, the inspectors let him offwith a warning, but not before suggesting that it was probably the Mafia thatwanted to buy the boxes.andM;&quot;They said the records of the bookmakers' long-distance calls get themconvicted in court,&quot; Maxfield recalls.andP;  If bookmakers manage to evade thetelephone company's billing equipment, of course, they not only avoid havingto pay for the long-distance calls they make, but there are no records thatfederal prosecutors can use against them.andM;Maxfield's prototype blue box took a midnight swim off a Huron River bridge,and the kid stayed out of trouble after that.andP;  He spent the next 20 yearschanneling his electronic expertise into installing and repairing phoneequipment.andM;A License to HackandM;In fact, Maxfield's career as a counterhacker began quite innocently, in1978, when he helped a local computer club start one of the nation's firstelectronic bulletin boards.andP;  Four years later, the FBI came looking forpirated software.andM;&quot;I knew the pirated software wasn't in the clubs, but I also knew aboutpirate bulletin boards that had sprung up in the area,&quot; Maxfield recalls.andP;  Sohe printed out some of the messages from the pirate boards and took them tothe local FBI office in 1982.andM;The FBI scarcely knew what to make of all the information that Maxfieldhanded them.andP;  &quot;They were still keeping records on 3-by-5 index cards,&quot; hesays.andM;But the bureau offered to compensate Maxfield for his expenses if he wouldmonitor the hacker bulletin boards and report to them.andM;Maxfield accepted.andP;  The arrangement gave him what every hacker and phonephreak would love to have: a license to hack.andP;  He could call anywhere in theworld or attack any computer and not worry about the consequences.andM;Maxfield might still be undercover for the FBI today if he and his contact atthe bureau had kept their mouths shut and not underestimated theresourcefulness of the hackers.andM;Following the success of his 1983 office party and the resulting raids,Maxfield, still undereover, got involved with a New York hacker group thathad taken control of a corporate voice-mail system.andM;Against the FBI's advice, Maxfield tipped off the voice-mail systemadministrator, leaving a message urging him to contact the FBI.andP;  &quot;What Ididn't know was that the hackers also had access to the systemadministrator's account, so they got the message first,&quot; Maxfield says.andM;One of the gang, members.andP;  posing as the system administrator, called the FBIand learned enough to identify Maxfield.andP;  A story about Cable Pair'sinvolvement with the government appeared in the first issue of 2600, inJanuary 1984.andM;&quot;We thought Cable Pair would be a promising contributor to this publication,&quot;the story concluded.andP;  Instead, we learned a valuable lesson: Don't trustanybody.&quot;andM;&quot;That's when the manure hit the fan,&quot; recalls Maxfield.andP;  &quot;I was burned sixways from Sunday.andM;&quot;My phone was ringing off the hook with death threats,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Thehackers were after me, and even the FBI didn't like me for a while.&quot;andM;It was an ignominious finish to Maxfield's underground activities for thegovernment, but it launched his career as a consultant and electronic privateeye.andP;  Several hackers who were worried about how much Maxfield knew abouttheir activities offered to become his double agents.andP;  &quot;Some were even morehighly placed than I was, and a couple of those people are still good sourcestoday.&quot;andM;Hacker groups are like street gangs, he says: the hierarchy changes all thetime, and the organization is very loose.andM;One way to get to the top of this shifting hierarchy is to be a sysop for apirate bulletin board, as Cable Pair was.andP;  Another way is to boast onlineabout hacking exploits (&quot;Well, I hacked into NASA's network and figured outhow to alter the course of the Hubble Space Telescope .andP;  .  .  &quot;) or to posta lot of pirated information on the system.andM;Maxfield uses the hackers' own techniques to penetrate their private bulletinboard systems.andP;  &quot;It's a mind game,&quot; he explains.andP;  &quot;Hackers will seek me outand feed me information about someone they hate or someone higher placed thanthey are&quot; just to get them out of the way.andP;  They're &quot;absolute anarchists,&quot;says Maxfield.andM;While Maxfield is watching the hackers, the hackers are watching him.andP;  SaysCorley, &quot;We have a nice, thick file folder on him.&quot;andM;6,000 Hackers at His FingertipsandM;Maxfield keeps more than file folders.andP;  His database, which has entries onabout 6,000 suspected hackers and phone phreaks, is cross-referenced by name,alias, phone number, gang associations, and criminal arrest record for phonefraud.andP;  He also tracks the names and numbers of pirate BBSs-and it's all athis fingertips.andM;Maxfield downloads information from his database directly to some clients.andO;Others receive his periodical, which reports on hacker activities and listsphone numbers of active hackers and pirate bulletin boards.andP;  Companies thatsuspect illegal phone activity can use the list like a reverse phonedirectory, comparing phone numbers on their bills against the list to isolatethe BBS from which the perpetrator is operating.andP;  Then they can work onpreparing a case for law enforcement.andP;  Very often, the same perpetrators tapinto the same system over and over, and companies that wish to prosecute mustassemble evidence over a considerable period.andM;Sometimes Maxfield gets involved directly, but he says he is &quot;not a bountyhunter&quot; and claims that he'll tip off corporations or phone companies aboutsecurity breaches even if they aren't clients.andM;He'll even help ATandamp;T, although his relations with the company are strained.andO;&quot;They still think I'm one of the bad guys,&quot; he says.andM;Others in the industry, however, find Maxfield's work helpful and valuable.andM;&quot;I put a lot of trust in the work he does,&quot; says Donn Parker, a computercrime expert at SRI International, in Menlo Park, California, and a regularsubscriber to Maxfield's reports.andP;  &quot;He does a very good job of keeping trackof the malicious hackers and the phone phreak community.&quot;andM;Maxfield often conducts computer security seminars for corporate clients andgovernment agencies.andP;  He can alert corporate clients to weak spots in theirsystems and advise them on how to tighten their electronic security.andP;  Hetells his clients that networks are particularly vulnerable to invasionbecause &quot;when you network systems together, it's like a chain, and you needonly attack the weakest link.andP;  All you need is one site with poor securityand you have a loophole.&quot;andM;Data sent over telephone lines can also be tapped.andP;  &quot;Some people sit on atelephone pole or in a car holding a laptop computer wired directly into thephone lines, picking off data and passwords,&quot; he says.andM;&quot;Computer security isn't a computer problem, it's a people problem,&quot; saysMaxfield.andP;  &quot;And people just aren't security-conscious.andP;  They leave doorsunlocked, and they write their passwords down and tape them to the fronts oftheir terminals.andM;&quot;We have the technical knowledge to secure these systems.andP;  We know how tokeep the hackers out, but it's a problem of implementation.andP;  It's expensive,and it makes the systems harder to use.andM;&quot;Any system that's user-friendly,&quot; cautions Maxfield, &quot;is alsohacker-friendly.&quot;andM;Maxfield is as addicted to his profession as the hackers are to their onlinecapers.andP;  Even if he wanted to quit the business, he says, he couldn't: &quot;Thehackers just won't leave me alone.&quot;andM;Maxfield admits that sometimes it's a little scary to be the Lone Ranger outthere.andP;  Much of what he's seen and worked on can't be discussed for fear thathackers will be onto what he's doing.andP;  But, he says, the problem is dire, and&quot;we've got to wake people up to this.andP;  We need to increase corporateawareness, law enforcement awareness, and public awareness.andP;  Computermanufacturers need to think about designing systems that are more secure, andthe phone system needs to rethink its entire network design.&quot;andM;And so Maxfield feels an obligation to continue his crusade.andP;  He knows toomuch to stop now.andM;What Will They Hack  Into Next'02andM;Press '1' to Find OutandM;It was late December 1987 when Anthony Goldberg, systems administrator for anOhio service bureau that leased voice mailboxes to local businesses, firstrealized that he had trouble.andM;&quot;I called my mailbox on the day before Christmas and got a very long andexplicit obscene message,&quot; he recalls.andP;  What distressed Goldberg more thanthe message's content was its location on the system.andP;  it hadn't simply beenleft in his box by a prankster who dialed his extension.andP;  The stream ofobscenities was installed as the system's holiday greeting to callers of alllines operated by the service bureau, Voice Mail inc. Goldberg, asadministrator, was supposed to be the only one able to install such agreeting.andP;  &quot;Someone with intimate knowledge of the system&quot; had put it there,he knew.andM;Working late one night, answering a phone call on a seldom-used line, hediscovered who had done it.andP;  It was  Chad,&quot; a deep-voiced man who claimedresponsibility for the Christmas message and demanded unfettered use of &quot;fiveor ten&quot; voice mailboxes, threatening to ravage the system if his requestwasn't met.andP;  Chad, who also referred to himself as &quot;Cellular Phantom,&quot; wenton to describe a community of like-minded individuals among whom access tocorporate voice mailboxes was considered power, a form of currency to beexchanged for other hocking information.andP;  The illicit trading was done oncomputer bulletin boards or on commandeered voice-mail systems.andM;&quot;He did it to be  'hip'-that was his expression,&quot; says Goldberg, who laterlearned that Chad was a 15-year-old high school sophomore.andP;  By that time,however, Voice Mail Inc. had been driven out of business by hackers'tampering.andM;&quot;All our customers-and their customers-were hearing this garbage,&quot; he says.andO;&quot;We'd tell them we had taken care of everything, and then it would comeback.&quot;andM;For Leslie Lynne Doucette, who trampled corporate voice-mail systemsnationwide until her arrest in 1989, phone hacking was no teenage joyride-itwas a business.andP;  In May, the 36-year-old mother of two pleaded guilty inChicago federal court to defrauding phone companies and corporations ofnearly $600,000, using information traded on illegally accessed corporatevoice-mail systems.andP;  As head of a ring of 150 hackers (most of themteenagers), Doucette trafficked in stolen credit card numbers, long-distancecalling-card codes, corporate private-branch-exchange (PBX) access codes,voice-mail passwords, and unpublished, toll-free numbers.andP;  (Typical message:&quot;I have a virgin, untouched VISA.andP;  Hasn't been burned.andP;  Might trade for atelephone card number.&quot;) The 17-count indictment that led to Doucette'sconviction was based in part on evidence that she had given the numbers ofstolen credit cards to youths who used the numbers to wire funds to her viaWestern Union.andM;Companies with voice-mail systems invaded by Doucette's crew found themselvesstuck with masive phone bills.andP;  Hockers had dialed into their systems usingthe toll-free numbers established for customers and traveling employees, thenfound ways to make outgoing long-distance calls from the victims' systems.andO;One company told authorities it had absorbed more than $100,000 in phonecharges.andP;  Another had been completely locked out of its own system.andM;Chad and Doucette might be called pioneers, explorers of the latest frontierin hacking: corporate voice-mail systems.andP;  The PBX systems that companies useto route calls internally, behind the wires, are just special-purposecomputers-in many cases PCs.andP;  So are voice-mail systems that attach to PBXsto digitize, store, and forward spoken messages.andP;  Breaking into them is nomore difficult than breaking into a data computer.andP;  In fact, it may beeasier: Phone hackers do much of their damage simply by pressing telephonekeys.andM;With suspicious computer bulletin boards coming under surveillance byauthorities, voice-mail systems offer an attractive alternative for hackerswho need to carry on clandestine communications.andM;&quot;They like the anonymity of voice mail,&quot; says William Cook, the assistantU.S.andP;  attorney in Chicago who headed the prosecution of the Doucette case.andO;&quot;They can cover their tracks by leaving a trail of coded messages ondifferent systems, like spies who set up a series of message-exchange pointsbefore making a drop.&quot;andM;Rami Abuhamdeh of the Communications Fraud Control Association, in McLean,Virginia, says attacks on business telephone systems are becoming ever morepopular.andP;  And it only stands to get worse.andP;  Surveys by Computer intelligenceindicate that 32 percent of Fortune 1,000 company offices with 100 or moreemployees use voice mail (up from 25 percent last year).andP;  Ten percent moreplan to add voice mail within a year.andM;&quot;I used to hear about one or two cases [of voice-mail fraud] a month.andP;  Nowit's three or four a week,&quot; says Gail Thackeray, assistant attorney generalfor the state of Arizona.andP;  Just days after Doucette's Chicago conviction,Thackeray's office and the U.S.andP;  Secret Service revealed the preliminaryresults of Operation Sundevil, a nationwide investigation in which theyseized 42 computer systems and 23,000 evidence-laden disks believed to beinvolved in hacking activities ranging from credit card and long-distancefraud to attacks on corporate computer and voice-mail systems.andM;Voice-mail and PBX hacking are descendants of &quot;phreaking,&quot; an art that datesto the early days of the electronics age.andP;  Twenty years ago, programmer JohnDraper (a.k.a.andP;  &quot;Captain Crunch&quot;) discovered that a toy whistle from a Cap'nCrunch cereal box emitted the precise tone allowing a caller to placelong-distance calls without being billed.andP;  A magazine article glamorizingDraper and phone phreaking reportedly inspired Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs,in their college days, to build and sell tone-emitting &quot;blue boxes&quot; on theBerkeley campus.andM;Today's phone-system hackers combine computing tools with newer phreakinggear such as &quot;pink noise&quot; machines (which produce a continuous backgroundtone to mask phreaking activities from surveillance) and tone-distortionequipment (which alters voices and disguises numbers dialed).andP;  A voice-mailhacker may use a PC-based war dialer&quot; to dial phone numbers rapid-fire,logging hits when voice-mail systems are reached.andM;Delving into individual systems involves  &quot;finger-hacking,&quot; telephoneguesswork to discover passwords to voice-mailboxes.andP;  A hacker discovering amailbox's password can change the password and lock out the rightful user.andM;The more sophisticated hackers look for unassigned boxes and seize hundredsin one swoop.andP;  Or they'll hunt for the administrative passcode that allowsthem to control the entire system.andM;Meanwhile, by using trial and error to learn a PBX's &quot;extender code,&quot; thepersistent hacker can get the PBX to produce a dial tone on an outside lineand make long-distance calls at the expense of the company that operates thesystem.andM;As this type of crime increases, phone-system manufacturers are becoming moresensitive to security needs, building in features that, for example,disconnect someone who makes too many wrong guesses at a mailbox password.andO;But experts say the biggest part of the problem may be user complacency.andP;  Notonly should telephone end-users take more precautions, but businesses need torethink the way they manage electronic communications systems.andP;  Manycompanies put voice and data systems under separate managers, who have littlecommon knowledge or responsibility.andM;Hackers, migrating easily between data and voice systems, think less of thesecorporate distinctions.andM;&quot;Computer hackers, phone phreaks, they all use voice mail,&quot; says Arizona'sThackeray.andP;  &quot;They'll use any means of communication they can.&quot;andP;  -DARAPEARLMANandM;AND DON STEINSERGandM;8 Ways to foil a Voice-mail HackerandM;A little security can go a long way in protecting your voice-mail system.andO;Take these simple precautions, and hackers will pass up your company's systemin search of one that's easier to crack.andM;CHANGE YOUR PASSCODE FROM THE DEFAULT SETTING.andP;  Avoid using common or obviouscombinations such as  1234,&quot; &quot;1990,&quot; or your phone extension.andM;CHOOSE A PASSCODE THAT IS AT LEAST SIX DIGITS LONG.andP;  A six-digit passcode is100 times harder to crock than a four-digit code.andM;DON'T CREATE UNASSIGNED MAILBOXES.andP;  Deactivate boxes that will be unattendedfor long periods of time.andM;DISABLE REMOTE-CONTROL ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM ACCOUNT.andP;  Otherwise, callers whobreak into the system con access system-management functions and create newmailboxes or change greetings.andM;MONITOR THE SYSTEM FREQUENTLY, and keep tabs on patterns of use.andP;  If a singlemailbox receives 200 cc is in one day, or if the volume of calls increasesappreciably after hours, it could mean the system is under attack.andM;USE YOUR VOICE-MAIL SYSTEM'S AUTO-DISCONNECT FEATURE.andP;  Auto-disconnect willcut off anyone who fails to enter a passcode correctly after a certain numberof tries.andM;SAFEGUARD YOUR SYSTEM'S TOLL-FREE PHONE HUMBER.andP;  Don't post the number in aconspicuous spot or publish it in a general phone directory.andM;BE DISCREET WHEN LEAVING VOICE-MAIL MESSAGES.andP;  Don't leave messages youwouldn't want anyone to overhear; instead, ask the person you're trying toreach to call you back.andP;  WENDY TAYLOR</TEXT></DOC>
