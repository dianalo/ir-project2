DavidPryor, D-Ark., said in releasing the report.   The Defense Contract Audit Agency, in a study of 118 audits,found that of the $269 million in consultant costs charged to thePentagon, contracts worth $53.7 million were considered``questionable.''   Among the charges were $2.2 million for executive or legislativelobbying and about $440,000 for unallowable public relations andadvertising. The highest cost was $33.8 million for ``lack ofadequate agreement@work product.''   These costs were incurred because a defense contractor did nothave a written agreement with the consultant.   ``This type of loosely monitored buddy system is what createdthe need for last year's Ill Wind investigation,'' Pryor said. ``Ican only hope that the Defense Department learns from these DCAAaudit reports and improves its management of its contractors.''   The audit agency recommended that defense contractors correctthe deficiencies in their system of estimating, approving andaccounting for consultant costs.   The Pentagon is reviewing federal acquisition regulationscovering the definition, allowability and documentationrequirements for consultant costs.</TEXT></DOC>
