Earlier, officials from both governments had saiddifferences remained over several issues -- most important,over specific goals for increased Japanese imports of autosand auto parts -- to be addressed in an &quot;action plan&quot; thatwould accompany the broader declaration Thursday. Japaneseofficials have been preparing a package of measures formonths, but U.S. officials who arrived in Tokyo this weekwere pushing for more.</LP><TEXT>   While working-level officials bargained over the actionplan, President Bush and Japanese Prime Minister KiichiMiyazawa announced yet another initiative, a grandly titled&quot;Strategy for World Growth,&quot; which U.S. officials describedas a major commitment on both sides to pursue domesticpolicies that will improve their countries' -- and thus theworld's -- economic performance. While the document wasmainly a reiteration of previously adopted measures, seniorU.S. officials sought to portray it, and the rest of theday's deliberations, in the most positive light.   A joint statement on the growth strategy, issued beforeMr. Bush became indisposed at dinner yesterday, included apassage that appeared to endorse the dollar's recent weaknessagainst the yen. According to the document, Mr. Bush and Mr.Miyazawa &quot;reviewed developments in financial markets andagreed that recent exchange-rate movements were consistentwith current economic developments. They expressed confidencethat the above measures and developments will contribute tocorrection of external imbalances.&quot; A stronger yen makesforeign goods cheaper for Japanese buyers and, in theory,should stimulate imports by Japan.   U.S. Treasury officials confirmed that the language wasmeant to endorse the recent strength of the yen against thedollar.   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who arrived hereTuesday night to make the announcement, lauded Tokyo'scommitment to make greater public investments, to stimulatedomestic demand and achieve a growth rate of 3.5% next year.Both the commitment and the 3.5% target were Japanese policybefore the &quot;Strategy for World Growth&quot; was announced,however. A senior administration official also implied thatthe Dec. 30 cut in the Japanese discount rate was coordinatedwith similar rate cuts in the U.S. &quot;I'm not going to say ifthey were or weren't {coordinated},&quot; the official said, &quot;butthey're awful close together if they weren't coordinated.&quot;   Mr. Brady dispatched his chief international deputy, DavidMulford, to brief the Europeans on the U.S.-Japanese talks.Mr. Brady said that finance ministers of the Group of Sevenindustrialized countries will assemble sometime around Jan.25. Even in Europe, where interest rates have been risinglately, there is new awareness of the need for the G-7 tohelp restore world-wide economic growth, a Treasury officialsaid. The official also said that Mr. Miyazawa wants to avoida repeat of the late 1980's when Japan's trade surplusmounted as domestic demand waned.   Another senior U.S. official involved in the trade talkstold reporters earlier in the day that the trip had been &quot;anenormous success already&quot; and that &quot;the government of Japanrecognizes that they've got to do something in a pro-activeway to change that {perception that Japan's markets aren'topen} in short order, and also recognize that they're notdoing it on a charitable basis to U.S. firms or the U.S.government.&quot;   But privately, U.S. officials conveyed a differentmessage. A lengthy negotiating session ended withimport-target levels for several sectors still unresolved,U.S. Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher told KozoWatanabe, Japan's Minister of International Trade andIndustry, of his dissatisfaction with the negotiations sofar. Aides said Mr. Mosbacher believed the Japanesegovernment was simply responding to immediate pressures andwas trying to acknowledge the complaints while making minimalconcessions.   In related developments, several Japanese auto makersunveiled plans to promote sales of U.S. cars through theirdealership networks, and some also announced furtherincreases in their planned purchases of foreign auto parts.The flurry of 11th-hour announcements appeared to reflectheavy pressure by U.S. officials on the Japanese governmentto produce the biggest possible goals for imports in anindustry that accounts for about three-fourths of the $40billion Japanese trade surplus with the U.S.   Other issues that remained under discussion Wednesdayevening were Japanese government purchases of foreigncomputers and the allegedly closed nature of Japan'sflat-glass and paper markets.   But autos and auto parts were the focus of attention, withseveral of Japan's biggest car companies unveiling furthermeasures to bolster U.S. sales here.   Toyota Motor Corp. said it is considering a plan to sellas many as 5,000 General Motors Corp. cars a year through itsaffiliated dealerships. Honda Motor Co. said it will tripleits sales of Chrysler Cherokees. And Mitsubishi Motors Corp.said it will increase the number of U.S.-made vehicles itsells in the Japanese market to 6,000 in the fiscal yearbeginning in April 1995, up from the 1990 level of 2,543units. Just two weeks ago, Mitsubishi had set the 1995 goalat 4,000 units. The total is expected to includeChrysler-brand models produced by Diamond-Star Motors, ajoint venture of Chrysler and Mitsubishi.   Although the goals seemed modest for the world'ssecond-largest car market, actual sales results will ofcourse depend on the reaction of Japanese buyers, whogenerally have a poor image of U.S. autos. A Tokyo televisionstation aired man-in-the-street interviews yesterday morningbut failed to find a single person interested in buying anAmerican car.   In a measure aimed at helping to improve the image of U.S.cars, the government-affiliated Japan External TradeOrganization was reported to be planning a one billion yen($8 million) program of nationwide trade fairs to promoteforeign cars in Japan.   Car makers also continued to announce further increases ingoals for purchasing foreign parts. So far, Japan's Big Fiveauto makers have set procurement goals for the year ending inMarch 1995 of about $20 billion in foreign parts, includingparts purchased for use in U.S. plants. That compares withabout $8 billion in the fiscal year that ended last March andis 20% above targets unveiled a few weeks ago. It wasn'tclear how much higher U.S. officials were hoping to see thefigure go.   &quot;It's not a matter of us accepting anything,&quot; said asenior administration official. The official also said oneunresolved issue on automotive trade concerned methodologyfor a planned joint study to analyze how U.S. and Japaneseauto makers choose suppliers for their auto parts.   Whether the flurry of measures will make a significantdent in the bilateral trade surplus in the near term seemeddoubtful. And a senior administration official acknowledgedthat merely spelling out proposed remedies in the action planwon't put an end to the trade issues, all of which have beenthe subject of continuing bilateral negotation.   In his meeting yesterday morning with Mr. Miyazawa, Mr.Bush described the auto issue as a crucial one. But,according to a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mr. Bushalso noted that German cars have sold much better than U.S.cars in Japan and suggested there may be lessons in that forthe U.S. industry.</TEXT></DOC>
