When it ends in a $152 million lawsuit.    And that's no joke.    Avanti Productions Inc., a Canadian game maker, has sued Coleco Industries Inc. for that amount in a dispute over an Avanti board game called -- that's right -- Punchline.    Avanti's suit alleges that Coleco, based in West Hartford, Conn., broke an agreement to market the game, thus costing Avanti millions in lost royalties. The game features jokes printed on cards; players tell the jokes, and the person who elicits the loudest laughter wins. &quot;We had a sure winner,&quot; claims Stewart Irvine, president of Avanti.    Hardly, says Coleco, which has countersued, contending that it couldn't sell the game because Punchline proved punchless. &quot;We tried the game on a number of test groups and determined the game was not going to be a success,&quot; says Coleco attorney Steven Bartlestone.    Avanti's suit, filed in September in U.S. District Court in New Haven, Conn., says that Coleco became interested in Punchline at a toy fair in New York in February 1986. Coleco bought marketing rights to the game for $600,000 plus royalties based on sales. Avanti was thrilled. The few thousand sets of the game that had made their way to store shelves before Coleco came along had sold out quickly, says Mr. Irvine. &quot;We thought what we had here is a winner of Trivial Pursuit dimension.&quot; (The Trivial Pursuit game is owned by Coleco).    But Coleco, worried by its market research, repackaged the game. After dropping some of the more risque adult jokes and aiming the game at a family audience, it displayed Punchline at this year's toy fair, with no success. &quot;Even the girl behind the counter who was supposed to push the product said 'this game stinks,'&quot; recalled Mr. Irvine, referring to the revised version.    As a result, Coleco decided not to market the game, although it says it will pay Avanti the $600,000 ($200,000 of which has already been paid).    That isn't enough for Avanti, which claims the withdrawal of Punchline from the market has caused its stock (traded on the Vancover Stock Exchange) to steadily drop to about 10 cents a share from a high of 1.10 Canadian dollars in September 1986, when the contract was signed. And although Avanti is now free to market its own game, its remaining financial resources are limited. Says Mr. Irvine: &quot;We invested a lot of money creating the game. Why, we even hired comedy writers from Hollywood to write our jokes for us.&quot;    A sample joke?    &quot;A very world wise and hip first grader slipped on the school stairs, bruised himself and skinned his knee. A teacher hurried over and said, 'Remember Freddie, big boys don't cry.' Freddie glared back at her and said, 'I'm not going to cry, I'm going to sue.'&quot;    Explains Mr. Irvine, &quot;It's all in the delivery of the punchline.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
