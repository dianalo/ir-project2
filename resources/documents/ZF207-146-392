 401 North Wabash, #600 Chicago, IL60611 (800) 333-1395 (312) 329-0700andM;List Price: $199 for the Combination Package; $149 for the Standard (withoutASCII); $295 for the LAN version (server and up to three workstations, $69per each additional workstation).andM;Requires: 384K RAM, two disk drives, DOS 2.0 or later.andM;In Short: Software Bridge is more thorough and accurate than any otherprogram tested in this group.andP;  It is also simple to install and intuitive tooperate, making it truly helpful in converting word processing files.andP;  Notcopy protected.andM;Software Bridge, a $199 file conversion package from Systems CompatibilityCorp., comes in a few different flavors.andP;  We tested the Combination Package,which is designed to translate to and from 18 different file formats,including ASCII.andP;  The company offers another version that supports all of theformats except ASCII, as well as a special version designed to run on LANs.andM;The program is a snap to install.andP;  You simply make a subdirectory and copythe files to it.andP;  The Combination Package contains six disks, but the manualshows clearly how to determine which files you can skip if you decide thatyou don't need all the different formats all the time.andM;There are no special requirements for your configuration file, except thatyou should have a statement setting FILES = 20 or some higher number.andP;  Themanual tells you how to add this line if you need to.andM;The user interface is logical and helpful.andP;  The program is configured so thatit can translate to and from any pair of formats at a given time.andP;  You canselect either of these pairs from the main menu.andP;  (Note that Software Bridgecan translate only to FFT (Final Format Text) and from Navy .DIF format.)andM;If you want to change the active pair, you select the System Setup option.andO;This lists the two active conversion formats on either side of your screenand puts a window in the middle showing the other available formats.andP;  Thedisplay is intelligent: if you select a format, it disappears from the centerlist, and the format that it replaced then becomes available in the center.andM;The System Setup screen opens onto a host of other options.andP;  You cancustomize certain parameters for the different formats and can set up complexcharacter-translation tables and filters.andP;  You also have access to on-screenhelp.andM;Once you have settled on your translation formats, you pick a direction (fromone to the other) and then select the files to be translated.andP;  These can comefrom different directories, and you can call up a directory in a window tohighlight the files you want.andP;  You can also select multiple files by enteringa wildcard for a filename.andP;  If your wildcard specification happens to includesome files you do not want to translate, it is a simple mater to highlightand delete them before starting the translation.andM;Software Bridge can also be run directly from the DOS prompt.andP;  You need togive it just four pieces of information: the input file, the output file, theinput format, and the output format.andM;All these details are explained in an attractive 70-page manual that containsall the information you need on how to run the program, including a goodquick-start section.andP;  It also explains the various options for the differenttranslation formats and their limitations.andP;  There is a thorough index at theend.andM;If there is a problem with Software Bridge, it's that the program runsslowly.andP;  Our conversion timings were based on relatively short documents, andthe timing differences could become either more or less significant fordocuments longer than the one we used.andP;  It's clear that for our two-pagedocument, the program took up to three times as long as the fastest programin the group tested.andM;On the other hand, speed is not the point of conversion software; what youultimately want are accurate conversions, and this is where Software Bridgeshines.andM;No other program came close to Software Bridge in terms of accuratelymatching the original documents after translation.andP;  On average, it lost fewerthan 3 points out of 38 across the 6 test conversions.andP;  Its closestcompetitor averaged 7.5 points off.andP;  For conversions involving the wordprocessors we used with the sort of document composed for our tests, SoftwareBridge is the clear winner.andM;It should be noted that the program was not able to go directly to or fromDisplayWrite 4, but instead used RFT (Revisable Form Text) as an intermediatestep that could be exported or imported by DisplayWrite.andP;  It did a better jobthan any competitor at handling RFT files.andM;Flexible, powerful, and easy to use: these are the attributes that makeSoftware Bridge attractive for file conversion projects.andP;  Its accuracy willtruly save you time and effort, and that's what makes this program the bestvalue of the bunch.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
