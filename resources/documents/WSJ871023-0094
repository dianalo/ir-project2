The measure, approved 14-2, would cost about $20 billion a year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Environmentalists hailed the action, while business groups protested that its cost would hurt the competitiveness of many U.S. plants and force some to close.    The bill's prospects of becoming law are uncertain. Its supporters hope to tie it to a widely supported deferral of penalties against cities that fail to meet current clean-air standards. But lawmakers from the Midwest, led by Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.), bitterly oppose its tough controls on coal-fired power plants, which would boost the region's electricity costs. Similar legislation is stymied in the House.    To curb pollutants that cause acid rain, the bill would clamp tighter controls on coal-fired boilers to cut the nation's sulfur dioxide emissions about 12 million tons, or roughly in half, by the year 2000. The EPA estimates that would cost between $7 billion and $10 billion annually.    Other parts of the bill would further restrict pollution from cars and trucks, incinerators that burn trash, and various sources in areas that persistently flunk federal air standards.    Before approving the bill, the Senate panel weakened its anti-acid rain provisions. It delayed the final deadline for sulfur dioxide emissions to 2000 from 1996 and set interim reduction levels. It also reduced the burdens on nine states that emit small amounts of sulfur dioxide and on plants more than 30 years old.    In a gesture to the Midwest, the measure includes a five-year, $2.5 billion program to fund projects demonstrating technologies that reduce air pollution from burning coal. </TEXT></DOC>
