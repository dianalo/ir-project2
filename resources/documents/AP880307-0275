Movie and television scriptwriters left their typewriters andjoined nearly 2,000 colleagues on a picket line at 20th Century Foxstudios in a contract dispute over the issues of residuals andcreative control.   Carrying placards reading ``The Writers Guild Strikes,'' picketsfive-abreast snaked in front of the Fox studios in West Los Angeles.   ``Hollywood has treated writers like bean-field workers foryears,'' said screenwriter and science fiction author HarlanEllison. ``It begins with the dream. Without the dream on paper,there is nothing.''   The Writers Guild of America rejected Sunday's final offer bythe Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and astrike was ordered for 9,000 of its 9,600 members. Six hundred newswriters were exempt.   ``We feel all the issues were dealt with fairly. They went onstrike on issues we felt were resolved,'' alliance spokesman HerbSteinberg said, adding producers were ``ready to write a check for$550 million'' for a new three-year contract. The alliancerepresents about 200 producers and studios.   The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service scheduled ameeting for both sides Tuesday.   Issues include demands by writers for a higher percentage offoreign market distribution residuals, and an offer by producers toscale back syndication residuals for one-hour television shows.   Producers claim new shows made for independent stations havedried up the rerun syndication market. Their offer includes anincrease to 150 percent of current residual agreements if the showdoes well in syndication.   Writers claim the offer is not equitable with a similar dealgiven the Directors Guild last summer.   Actress Patty Duke, president of the Screen Actors Guild, alsoshowed up on the picket line to show solidarity with the writers,but the actors contract prohibits secondary walkouts.   The union said talk shows, game shows and soap operas wouldquickly reflect the strike's impact, but producers said scripts hadbeen stockpiled and that many prime-time shows had completedshooting for the season.   ``Viewers will begin seeing the effects on those programsrelying on scripts on a daily basis. Talk shows, game shows and thesoaps will see a difference right away,'' guild spokeswoman CherylRhoden said.   A three-month strike delayed the fall television season in 1981.   ``It's business as usual. We're prepared,'' CBS spokeswomanJanet Storm said. The network produces the soaps ``Guiding Light,''``As the World Turns,'' ``The Bold And The Beautiful'' and ``TheYoung And The Restless.''   NBC spokesman Dom Giofre said the network's ``Another World,''``Days Of Our Lives'' and ``Santa Barbara,'' wouldn't be affectedsoon because there were scripts already written for another month.   The strike won't immediately effect NBC's ``Late Night WithDavid Letterman'' and ``Saturday Night Live,'' which were alreadyon scheduled breaks. ``The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson''featured guest host Jay Leno on Monday, as scheduled. But thecomedian used material prepared before the strike, Giofre said.   On daily production shows such as soap operas, writers normallyturn out scripts near shooting schedule deadlines. Shows like``Late Night With David Letterman'' are known for ad-lib lines, butmuch of the monologue and skits are created by a writing staff.Since much of the material is topical, it often is written withinminutes of showtime.   Picket captain Stanley Ralph Ross said selection of Fox ``wasfairly arbitrary,'' adding its size and location had a lot to dowith it. ``We usually pick a major studio, and there's parkingaround here.''   The guild's contract expired at midnight Feb. 29.   Producers had sought to scale back residual payments for someone-hour shows syndicated in the United States and said theycouldn't pay writers more for reruns in foreign markets.   Steinberg claimed foreign residual payments have increased 84.6percent since 1972, which was the last time writers negotiated thatissue. Writers receive a single lump sum that varies depending onwhat is negotiated between the writer and producer.   ``When the business is good, they are going to share it,''Steinberg said. ``But while we're making money in foreign, we'restill losing money in domestic, and that foreign distribution moneyhas to cover those losses.''   The median annual income for writers is $40,000 a year, butabout half of the WGA's members are unemployed at any given time,Ms. Rhoden said.</TEXT></DOC>
