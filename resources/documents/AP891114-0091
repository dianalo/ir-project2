KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate moved today toward agreement on acompromise $738 million plan to spur the rebirth of democracy andfree enterprise in Poland and Hungary.   The bipartisan compromise was announced less than 48 hoursbefore Lech Walesa, leader of Poland's Solidarity union movement,was to address a joint meeting of Congress.   Formal approval of the plan, expected today, would be animportant step toward resolving a long dispute over the size of theprogram.   ``It almost sounds trite to say that what is happening inEastern Europe is mind-boggling, but thank God for it,'' Sen.Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said as the debate resumed this morning.   ``We must do all we can afford, as quickly as we can, to helpmake these changes in Eastern Europe irreversible,'' Humphrey saidas the Senate approved his amendment to earmark 10 percent of theprivate enterprise funds contained in the bill for Solidarity and aPolish free-enterprise association.   Humphrey said the change was necessary to permit some of themoney to move quickly, cutting through bureaucratic delays asapplications are considered.   Senate Democrats originally had sought a three-yearauthorization level for the two East European nations of $989millions, while Republicans called for a $585 million ceiling.   All the proposals, including the $840 million authorized earlierby the House, overshadow the total $455 million proposed over thelast several months by President Bush.   Asked today if Bush favors the $738 million aid package forPoland and Hungary nearing approval in the Senate, White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We're generally supportive. We'dlike to get billions if we had them.''   Differences between the House and Senate versions of the aidpackage are expected to be resolved quickly.   The Senate builds on key elements advocated by the president,including an Enterprise Fund to help both nations move away fromcommunist centralized planning and toward free-market systems.   The funds, intended to help both countries establish free-marketsystems, would allocate $260 million for Poland and $65 million forHungary.   In recognition of Poland's serious economic problems, the billallocates $657 million for that country while Hungary would receive$81 million.   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas noted Democrats haddropped a $200 million credit stabilization plan for Poland, a planhe said Republicans believed would be unworkable and merely add toPoland's large foreign debt.   The compromise trimmed the rival Democratic plan to ``a morerealistic size,'' Dole said.   Poland and Hungary remain members of the Warsaw Pact, accordingto Dole, who said the compromise has a number of safeguards,including barring any funds from being used for military aid toCuba or Nicaragua.   Meanwhile, congressional Democrats opened fire on thepresident's approach to other crucial events in Eastern Europe,including East Germany's decision to open the Berlin wall 28 yearsafter it was erected across the divided city.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said today it is``regrettable'' that Bush has rejected the idea of going to Berlinto express American satisfaction with the ``symbolic destruction''of the wall or to normalize trade relations with the Soviet Union.   ``While the president has rejected all of these, he has reversedhimself on issues before and I hold out out hope he will do soagain,'' the Maine Democrat told reporters.   Mitchell said he also believes Bush should convene an emergencyconference of the Western allies to chart the future of Europe inthe light of events in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.   ``Obviously the post-World-War II era is coming to an end,marked by the upheaval in Eastern Europe and the new economic eraorder in Western Europe,'' Mitchell said.   It is important, he said, that the United States now assert itsfull leadership in ``shaping that new order.''   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday he couldn't``foresee any set of circumstances at this moment that wouldinduce'' Bush to go to Berlin.   On Monday, the Senate unanimously adopted a resolution welcomingthe opening of the wall, condemning it as a ``symbol ofoppression'' and demanding.</TEXT></DOC>
