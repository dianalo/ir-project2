The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, foundthat the United States had 18 coproduction agreements with sixcountries _ West Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, South Korea andSwitzerland _ and that three of those countries violated the pacts.   The GAO would not release the names of the three countries, whichit said are classified. But it did say that the breaches involved inagreements covering tanks, helicopters, Stinger anti-aircraftmissiles and ammunition.   ``In several instances, the arms were sold to governments thatare patently unfriendly to the United States,'' said the report,which did not specify whether the nations were on the StateDepartment's terrorist list or provide any other description.   The State Department, which is responsible for handling incidentsof noncompliance, took some action on the cases, the GAO said.   The House Armed Services subcommittee on investigations releasedthe report just a day after President Bush decided to endorse anagreement in which the United States would join forces with Japan toco-develop and co-produce the FSX, an advanced version of the U.S.F-16 fighter.   ``Today, we're talking about new agreements with some of the samecountries that will involve the transfer of some of our besttechnology,'' said Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., chairman of thesubcommittee.   ``It seems to me that we need to reexamine this policy and onlyenter these arrangements if there are rock-solid capabilities inplace to make sure our troops don't end up facing our own weaponssome day.''   Among its recommendations, the GAO suggested that the DefenseDepartment update its coproduction directive, which was last revisedin 1974. The directive does not contain specific rules for themilitary services or overseas security assistance organizations tohandle the programs and ensure compliance with the agreements.   The investigation was prompted by the disclosure last year thatSouth Korea had overproduced and sold M-16 rifles and parts to othercountries without U.S. consent. The two nations had reached anagreement setting production limits and barring such sales.</TEXT></DOC>
