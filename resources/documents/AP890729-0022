All-night food vendors, street sweepers, pedicab drivers,drifters _ anyone who happened to be up _ would gather at theflagpole to watch three soldiers goose-step out of the imperialpalace and march into the square to raise the flag.   These days, however, watching the national flag go up requiresan invitation or advance permission.   The square has been closed to the general public since June 4,when the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement began and soldiersbacked by tanks drove student protesters from the square, thesymbolic center of China. Bicyclists now are forbidden to stopalong its edge.   Today, about a dozen foreign journalists and more than 80children from the Wangfujing Elementary School had permission towatch the flag raising.   The students wore the red kerchiefs of the Young Pioneers, theCommunist Party children's organization, and their teacher saidthey were there to ``learn to love the country and love the army.''   The children marched silently onto the 100-acre square, led by ahalf-dozen young soldiers who barked commands at them: ``Forward.Right face. Sit.''   Except for the soldiers and city buses that lumbered by, thestill-dark square was silent. At the far end, on the monument torevolutionary heroes that the students had turned into a protestcommand post, two soldiers stood guard while six comrades napped,wrapped up in bedrolls on the stone pavement.   At 5:30 a.m., the square's lights blinked off and the childrensat silently on the pavement. At 5:52 a.m., 12 minutes later thanscheduled, three soldiers emerged from the palace gate bearing theflag.   The ceremony has been modified since June 4 _ two other soldiersstood guard with submachine guns.   Upon order, the children raised their right arms in salute asthe flag went up. The few without neckerchiefs stood with arms attheir sides, apparently not allowed the honor of saluting theirflag.   A few silent minutes, and it was over. The children sat backdown for a brief lecture by a white-gloved soldier on the historyof China's flag. ``It is the color of fresh blood,'' he told thestudents, reminding them of the bloody civil war that preceded theCommunist rise to power.   A quick march around the square, and the children were off toschool. Officers roused the sleeping soldiers with shouts of``Hey.'' Bedrolls under their arms, they stumbled off the monument.   Before June 4, sunrise was the signal for dozens of pedestriansto stream onto the square to take their morning exercise and enjoythe freshest air of the day.   Today, more than 50 army trucks, each bearing about 36 soldiers,pulled up in rows on one side of the vast expanse.   ``They are here to see the (Mao Tse-tung) memorial hall and theGreat Hall of the People and Zhongnanhai,'' the party headquarters,said an officer, who refused to identify the unit. ``It's a goodchance for them to see these things they would not otherwise see.''   The memorial hall, where revolutionary leader Mao's preservedbody is exhibited, has been closed to the public since the buildingunderwent repairs over the winter. When will it and the squarereopen?   ``I don't know. I'm sure sooner or later,'' the officer said.</TEXT></DOC>
