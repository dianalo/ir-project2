The issue, Fannie Mae's first since it got permission to issue Remics last spring, contained some unusual provisions designed to increase its appeal to investors.    Most significantly, Fannie Mae promised to give investors monthly updates on the weighted average coupon and maturity of the mortgage pools backing the securities. Because prepayments change both the yield and maturity of pools of mortgages, regular updates, which aren't generally available, are valuable to investors.    Remics, or real estate mortgage investment conduits, were created by the 1986 tax act, and allow greater flexibility in structuring mortgage-backed securities than was possible under previous law.    The offering includes a $151 million portion, targeted specifically to thrifts, which was the fastest-selling part of the offering, according to Chuck Ramsey, a managing director at lead manager Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. Because it has a maturity that is guaranteed to be less than five years, the thrift-targeted portion qualifies as a liquid asset under federal regulations that require thrifts to keep 5% of their portfolio in such assets.    Mr. Ramsey said demand for that portion of the offering was so enthusiastic that the underwriters stopped marketing it Monday, trying to shift investors to other portions of the issue.    &quot;I've never seen a deal go this fast in a falling market,&quot; Mr. Ramsey said, adding that the only portion of the offering that gave the managers any concern was a $24 million zero-coupon piece that wasn't placed until yesterday morning, when it was bought by a large California thrift he declined to identify.    Fannie Mae's ability to issue Remics was a matter of furious debate last spring. Thrift institutions and most major investment banks lobbied fiercely to prevent the government from giving the agency authority to issue Remics, claiming that Fannie Mae was infringing on their turf. Fannie Mae is a government-sponsored privately owned corporation that buys residential mortgages from lenders and repackages them into securities for sale to investors.    Fannie Mae won the fight, getting permission to issue as much as $15 billion of the tax-advantaged securities during the next year. Robert J. Levin, a senior vice president of the agency, said Fannie Mae is now looking at a program that would let lenders swap their mortgages for Fannie Mae Remics. &quot;It's very preliminary,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to get over a lot of operational and legal issues and what I call the critical mass issue,&quot; meaning the need for enough securities to create a liquid market.    Bear Stearns, one of the few investment banking firms to support Fannie Mae on the Remic issue, is lead manager of the offering. While some firms that opposed Fannie Mae have been given roles as co-managers, market participants note that two of the agency's most outspoken opponents in that battle, Salomon Brothers Inc. and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., were left out of the management group. Mr. Levin said Fannie Mae chose Bear Stearns to lead the issue because it brought the best ideas, and chose the rest of the management group based on their presentations.    Altogether, the offering consists of five separate classes of securities. The thrift-oriented portion, with an average life of 1.6 years and a maximum maturity of five years, carries a bond-equivalent yield of 7.85%. A second, $239 million portion, was priced at a 9.55% yield and carries an average life of 5.9 years. Fannie Mae is retaining a third, $85.5 million portion of the issue.    The zero-coupon portion, with an average life of 18.4 years, carries a yield of 10.86%. The issue also contains a $1 million residual piece, which gives its investors any cash that remains once all the other investors have been paid, priced to yield 10.86%. </TEXT></DOC>
