If you think the only way is to pull downthe Apple menu, choose the Control Panel, and go to the Monitors cdev, you'rewrong.andP;  Fortunately, there's a much easier method.andP;  The second rule for usinga 24-bit-color-system (indeed, any color system) is: Get a copy ofSwitch-A-Roo.andP;  Similar utilities are available (Screen Flipper, for example),but Switch-A-Roo is my favorite.andP;  It's simple, and it's free (you can get itfrom Zmac and other freeware sources) - what more can you ask for?andO;Switch-A-Roo is an Fkey that lets you configure Command-Shift-as 9 a togglebetween two video parameters (see Figure 1).andP;  For example, now that I have a24-bit-color board installed, I generally set the toggle between 24-bit and8-bit color.andP;  Switching to the lower color resolution results in fasterscreen updates (and gets rid of those annoying screen flashes).andP;  And to beperfectly honest, I rarely use my system's 24-bit-color capabilities.andP;  Onlywhen I'm manipulating color or touching up color transitions in a graphicwith Adobe Photoshop, for example - do I turn on 24-bit color.andP;  Is Your DiskBig Enough?andM;If you use 24-bit color a lot (to create or manipulate graphic images, forexample), you're going to discover another little rule of the high-resolutionworld: Your hard disk is never big enough.andM;Because the size of scanned or painted 24-bit-color images can be stupendous,you need to prepare your system to deal with large files.andP;  There are severalways to do this:andM;Use a removable-media drive.andM;Buy a high-speed, high-capacity hard-disk drive.andM;Compress your images on-disk.andM;All of the above.andM;I use removable-cartridge drives for large graphic images.andP;  Even though my42megabyte cartridges don't hold many high-resolution images each, I prefernot to have images cluttering up my regular hard disk.andP;  A simplelabeling-and-shelving system makes it easy for me to find the image I'mlooking for, and I tend to group related images on cartridges.andP;  Because Ihave a dual-drive Bemoulli box, I can copy these images quickly (it takesjust a couple of minutes to copy a 42-megabyte cartridge from one drive toanother), and I simply send the copy to the client or service bureau.andP;  Onewarning: This is an expensive way to deal with the problem of large 24-bitimages - even with the discount prices now available, removable cartridgescost about $75 apiece.andM;The second solution is to buy the biggest, fastest, meanest hard drive youcan find.andP;  I strongly suggest that if you select this route, you thinkseriously about stretching your budget as far as it will go.andP;  A 200-megabytedrive probably isn't enough if you're doing a lot of work with 24-bit color.andO;Indeed, I'd look long and hard at those still-very-expensiveoptical-cartridge drives: They have removable cartridges, and some are fastenough to be tolerable as a regular drive - nice if you're working withhundreds of high-resolution images.andP;  In short, money shouldn't be the objecthere: Get the fastest, highest-capacity drive you can afford.andM;Another potential solution is image compression.andP;  Several productsColorsqueeze from Kodak and Storm Technology's PicturePress, for example -have been developed to work exclusively with color images.andP;  These productsuse the JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group) standard to compress images.andO;JPEG compression can result in slight image-quality loss, depending on thelevel of compression you require, but this is usually not noticeable exceptat very high levels of compression.andP;  These compression products are prettyimpressive, letting you reduce a 7-megabyte picture down to an image that'sfar less than 100K !andP;  The problem with any of these image compressionprograms is that they require an extra step when you're loading or savingimages, and the software can take a while to perform its magic.andP;  Ifcompression intrigues you, keep your eyes open, because several hardwarecompression products will soon appear.andP;  It's quite possible that these willbe fast enough to warrant a serious look by anyone using 24-bit color.andM;Probably the best solution for dealing with huge files is to combine themethods I have outlined above.andP;  For example, it makes sense to compressimages when you archive them onto a removable cartridge.andP;  Compression isstill a bit too slow to justify doing it as you're working on an image,however.andP;  Instead, compress the image when you're finished working with it orneed to send it to a service bureau.andP;  Use compression as an archivingtechnique that saves space on your hard disk or when sending files across anetwork or via modem.andP;  For more on dealing with huge files, see &quot;Too Big toFit on a Floppy?&quot; February '91, page 232.)andM;Can You Make it Faster?andM;How about QuickDraw accelerators? These accelerator cards improve your Mac'sprocessing speed by routing QuickDraw calls away from the Mac's CPU.andP;  If youfrequently work with 24-bit color, you might want to consider them carefully,because a good accelerator can come close to eradicating the speed lag 24bitcolor adds to your system's screen drawing.andP;  The time to consideraccelerators, however, is before you buy your 24-bit board.andP;  Apple,RasterOps, Radius, and SuperMac have acceleration products.andP;  Each company hastaken a slightly different tack, and you're probably best off if you purchasea video board and an accelerator from the same company.andM;Despite the claims various companies make, most of these accelerators doabout the same thing: They make working with 24-bit color faster than workingwith 8-bit color.andP;  Because of the way the company's designs differ, you'llfind that certain accelerators do better with certain software products.andO;Your best bet is to take the software you use most to a store that will letyou try out the accelerators you're considering.andP;  If you use a wide range ofsoftware products in 24-bit color, you'll probably find that the acceleratorsall have about the same effect.andP;  The accelerators provide only a modestimprovement in 8bit-color mode, so you'll probably be tempted to leave theunit in 24-bit-color mode all the time.andP;  Apple's 24-bit accelerated colorboard, the Macintosh Display Card 8.24 GC, is the exception: At least in thelimited time I used it, it seemed to be significantly faster in 8-bit-colormode than the Radius and RasterOps accelerators I've used more extensively.andM;Accelerators have their disadvantages.andP;  If you don't have a II, IIx, or IIfxchassis, a 24-bit-color card and an accelerator will certainly put you nearthe limits of your computer's power supply.andP;  Things are improving on thisfront as new technology comes to play, but if all the slots in your Mac arefilled or you have a hard drive that draws substantial power, you may haveproblems.andP;  Moreover, the large power draw of these boards results in extraheat - so make sure your machine is well ventilated and the fan is notclogged with dust.andM;Expect to find some of your software acting idiosyncratically if you installan accelerator.andP;  Early versions of Adobe Illustrator were notorious for notworking with new color hardware released by third parties.andP;  Fortunately,Adobe has fixed those problems in later releases, but you'll stilloccasionally find a software product that objects to what 24-bit-color isdoing in the background.andP;  That's another reason to have Switch-A-Roo handy.andO;Many of the programs that react violently to 24-bit color run fine when youswitch to 8-bit mode.andM;What You SeeandM;Ain't What You GetandM;And then there's the issue of color matching.andP;  The problems inherent in colorcalibration are almost overwhelming: Color varies across a monitor, lightingcan affect your perception of color, you can make only an approximate matchbetween colors on-screen and colors from a color printer, thecolor-separation and printing process you use directly affects the colorrendition, and on and on.andP;  Even those people I've talked to who usecalibration systems such as TekColor from Tektronix or Radius' PrecisionColorCalibrator say that although these systems help, they don't eliminate theproblem of matching screen colors to printed ones.andM;if you're selecting colors on the monitor for a document that will be printedlater, you'll have to get used to tweaking the colors after proofing them orelse settle for slight discrepancies.andP;  That's not to say that some of thecolor-matching equipment now available won't help make this process easier -I'm simply warning you that it's no panacea.andP;  Using a color-matching systemwon't guarantee that the colors you see on the display are going to look thesame on glossy paper from a web press.andM;I think the expense of color-calibration systems is too high for theiroverall effectiveness, so my advice is to be careful in shopping for such asystem: Make sure it does what you expect before you buy it.andM;in Living ColorandM;once you've acquired a 24-bit-color board, you'll probably spend a fairportion of your computing time in 24-bit color.andP;  The old standard, 8-bitcolor, will begin to look about as sophisticated as a coloring book with alimited palette of crayons, and if you're working with photographic images,the detail and subtlety of 24-bit color will be hard to resist.andM;Nevertheless, I'm a pragimatist and I think you should be too.andP;  Besides thetips I've just provided, let me leave you with one more thing to consider:More is not always better.andP;  Consider that multimedia presentation you'reputting together.andP;  Yes, it would be great to use photos as backgrounds whenyou play back your presentation on a 35-inch Mitsubishi monitor, but if theaudience has to wait for those detailed images to load, which can takeseconds on even the fastest Mac, you risk losing a sense of pace or, worsestill, losing the audience.andP;  Although the people I know who are working inmultimedia have installed 24-bit color in their machines, the two bestpresentations I've seen were done in 8-bit color.andP;  They were fast, they hadsnap, the colors were selected carefully to add life to the images, and theaudience didn't have time to notice that the color wasn't the most subtle inthe world.andM;If you do run out and buy a 24-bit color card, make sure you turn theadded-color capabilities off occasionally and see what you can do with thelower-resolution settings.andP;  You might be pleasantly surprised.andP;  Countributingeditor Thom Hogan has handed over the reins of Macreations to his partner andis now an evangilist with GO Corp.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
