Analysts say the declines are further indication that Phillips is liquidating at a faster rate than other major oil companies. Like most oil companies, Phillips invested relatively little in exploration last year because of low oil and gas prices.    The energy concern also is highly leveraged, with long-term debt of $5.76 billion at year's end, and has been selling oil and gas properties to reduce its debt load.    &quot;It suggests to me that they are fighting an uphill battle and they are losing,&quot; says Sanford Margoshes, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    The disclosure of reserve data in the company's annual report comes on the heels of active trading in Phillips's stock that has pushed the stock price as high as $15.675 a share -- the highest level since early 1985.    Phillips has been the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange twice this week, with more than four million shares changing hands on both Tuesday and Wednesday. In composite trading, Phillips shares dropped 25 cents to close at $15.125 each on volume of 1.7 million shares.    Analysts attributed the stock activity to firmer oil prices and more confidence in the company's future, but they cautioned that the company's debt still makes it a relatively risky investment. &quot;I prefer other companies in the energy group,&quot; says Edith Barschi, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. analyst.    The company said its U.S. oil reserves fell 24% during 1986. Its U.S. natural gas reserves declined 10%.    World-wide, however, Phillips's gas reserves grew 5%, primarily because of revisions in reserves at the company's Ekofisk field in Norway. As previously reported, the Norway reserves were reduced in 1985 because Phillips had to reinject natural gas into the field to keep it from subsiding. The amount of gas reinjected was reduced in 1986, allowing the company to again count the reserves.    The company's global natural gas liquids reserves grew 13%, while its U.S. natural gas liquids reserves increased 28%.    Overall, Phillips reserves declined less than the 11% the company predicted last fall because of the adjustment to the Ekofisk field and because U.S. natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves were higher than initial evaluations indicated. </TEXT></DOC>
