The rendering of a dove emerging through shades of blue over ablooming red rose, drawn by Mustafa Mustafa Tahoukji, captured thetheme of the contest, ``Peace will help us grow,'' said CharlesStuckey, curator of 20th-century painting and sculpture at the ArtInstitute of Chicago and one of five judges.   ``It just came as a stunner when we found out the winning postercame from a child who was witnessing the nightmarish reality thatone associates with Lebanon for the last decade,'' Stuckey saidSaturday.   Tahoukji will receive $500 and a trip to the United Nations withhis family to receive an award March 13, Cannon said.   The Lions Club tried to call an affiliate in Lebanon so officialsthere could tell the boy the good news, but the language barrierprevented much exchange, said Patrick Cannon, spokesman for the OakPark-based Lions Club. Lions officials planned to send a telex toLebanon with more detailed information, but Cannon said the boystill may not have learned that his entry won.   The contest, sponsored by Lions Club International, examinedentries from nearly 100,000 children in 49 countries.   The 24 finalists' posters and Tahoukji's winning entry, unveiledFriday, are on display at the Art Institute through Feb. 28. Thefinalists will receive $100 and a certificate, Cannon said.   It was the simplicity of the boy's poster, the shape of thedove's body, and the expression on its face that persuaded thejudges to choose it over more abstract representations of peace.   ``It's a difficult form of art because when one wants to reducethings down to essentials ... the risk is a one-liner,'' Stuckeysaid. ``He made it more complicated without throwing away thesimplicity.''   The contest was designed to give young people an opportunity tothink about peace and ``express it visually using their emotions andtheir talents,'' said Cannon.   Many of the posters featured similar themes, which Stuckeyattributes to the innocence of the participants _ ages 10 through 14_ and increased communication among nations.   ``There's something so uniform about the designs,'' he said. ``Ifthis were done 30 years ago, I would think it would be really ratherobvious that these were coming from different parts of the world.''   ``Obviously, doves were a common image, but another from Finlandhad a forest of trees growing in the night,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
