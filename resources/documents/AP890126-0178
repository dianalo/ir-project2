But the staff, making the recommendation to the commission, saidthe containment vessels, known as Mark I and built by GeneralElectric Co., posed no immediate danger to public health or safety.   The commission took no action and said it would meet soon with anNRC advisory panel that earlier this week said the proposedmodifications were unjustified.   The plant owners have generally opposed past suggestions ofmodifying the containment shells, although the Pilgrim nuclearreactor at Plymouth, Mass., over the last year has voluntarilyperformed all the actions now being urged by the NRC staff.   Victor Stello, the NRC's executive director of operations, toldthe commissioners that the modifications would cost no more than$150 million for all 24 plants involved, and that the financialburden was more than offset by safety gains.   He added, however, ``We do not believe there is any particularproblem that requires precipitous action.''   The Mark I containments have been singled out for attention bythe NRC because studies have shown them to be more vulnerable tofailure during a reactor accident than other containment systems. Acontainment failure could lead to the release of dangerous amountsof radioactivity into the atmosphere around the reactor.   The probability of a reactor core meltdown in a Mark Icontainment in any given years is estimated at between one-in-10,000and one-in-100,000 _ not appreciably different than the risk for theindustry as a whole, said Bill Beckner, the NRC's chief of severeaccident issues.   As recently as 1986, NRC officials said the Mark I containmentsystem was likely to fail in nine out of 10 severe accidents, suchas a core meltdown. Commission experts said Thursday, however, thatthe chances of failure were now believed to be much lower, althoughthey said there was wide disagreement on exact odds.   Lando W. Zech, the NRC chairman, said, ``We should take ourtime'' in deciding whether to require the changes to 24 of thenation's 110 operating reactors. He suggested that pressure to actquickly could lead to new safety problems.   ``We want to improve safety, not detract from it,'' he said.   Anti-nuclear groups have called for quick action to improvesafety at the Mark I facilities.   ``The way it looks now, I don't see them (the NRC) doinganything,'' Kenneth Boley, a nuclear safety analyst at theanti-nuclear group Public Citizen, said in an interview after thecommission meeting.   Among the modifications recommended by the NRC staff is theinstallation of hard pipe vents that would relieve severe pressureresulting from damage to a reactor core.   Stello said four or five of the 24 Mark I facilities already havethe improved their venting systems. He did not say which plants wereinvolved.   The commission staff also called for the provision of analternate water supply with pumping capability independent of thenormal and existing emergency power system. It also said emergencyprocedures and training should be improved.
