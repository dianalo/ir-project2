Test-tube experiments showed that asbestos fibers can bind togenetic material outside a cell and insert the material into thecell, damaging the genetic material in the process.   If that happens in people, it may help explain why exposure toasbestos causes an increased risk of lung cancer and of a cancer ofthe chest lining called mesothelioma, researcher Edward Johnsonsaid Thursday.   But an asbestos expert said she questioned how relevant thetest-tube findings are for human cancer.   The work is reported in the new issue of the Proceedings of theNational Academy of Sciences by Johnson and his colleagues at theMount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.   It dealt with deoxyribonucleic acid, called DNA, which is thesubstance that makes up genes. Every cell of the body contains aset of genes, which help direct its activities.   Cancer can result if genes are damaged or if certain ones areactivated inappropriately.   In a series of test-tube experiments, researchers found thatasbestos fibers can bind to DNA outside a cell and introduce theDNA to the cell's interior. Some of the DNA inserted itself amongthe cell's own genes, and at least some of it reproduced itself.   A known cancer-causing gene in the introduced DNA was found tobe active after entering cells, and a second gene remained active18 days after entering.   Johnson suggested that in people, the introduced DNA may triggercancer when it is inserted among a cell's genes. Or the DNA itselfmay be damaged in such a way that it could trigger cancer, sinceasbestos was found to damage the DNA it inserted, he said.   The insertion may also trigger the cell's natural mechanisms forDNA repair, which may end up making mistakes in repair that lead tocancer, Johnson said.   The work was done with monkey kidney cells to aid in testing forreproduction of DNA. The experiments were not set up to showwhether the cells would become cancerous.   Brooke Mossman of the University of Vermont College of Medicinesaid the experimental conditions are different enough from those ofthe human body that the findings may not pertain to human cancer.   Experiments could be done with human cells instead, she said.Mossman, who was scientific chairwoman of a recent internationalworkshop on the effect of asbestos and other mineral dust on cells,also said she doubted DNA for insertion is as available in the bodyas it was in the experiment.   Johnson replied that monkey kidney cells are routinely used forcancer studies, and that such DNA has been found in lung fluid.</TEXT></DOC>
