Detaileddesigns except main parameters were formulated as the problems to resolveoptimal cable route, that is, the shortest path (or minimum cost) anddetermined automatically. Analysis and evaluation of the investment costcould be simplified. The effect was confirmed by the computerized simulationapplying this model to a standard city block.
