Keith McDonald, director of strategicplanning, were amiable, keysystem savvy and well over six feet tall.andO;Together, they gave us quite an impressive demo of the new product.andM;Mr.andP;  McDonald prefaced the testdrive with an architectural assessment.andP;  &quot;TheExecutech 2000 is the first modular system we've ever sold,&quot; he observed.andM;&quot;However, we are still fully committed to the concept of the unitized KSU.andO;We think it makes for a better-protected, higher-quality design.&quot;andM;Indeed, the Executech family comprehends three fully unitized bases -- of6x12, 8x20 and 16x32 dimensions.andP;  The two smaller systems have only oneprinted wiring board inside, along with a power supply.andM;Two modules -- a 4x12 and a 0x16 -- are available to fortify any of the threebase units.andP;  The 4-by-12 module can boost your typical 6x12 KSU to a 10x24,while the 0-by-16 gives you a 6x28, for extensionrich applications.andP;  Like thebase units, Executech 2000 modules boast a fully unitized design.andP;  They areharnessed to the sealed KSU via two ribbon connectors.andM;Battery back-up has been made standard on this system.andP;  A recharger is builtright into the KSU -- all you need to supply are two 12-volt gel cells.andP;  Inthe event of a power failure, the system remains working for a full hour.andO;After the crisis has passed, it takes about a day to recharge your batteriesto their full strength.andM;Once Mr. McDonald had concluded his architectural lesson, Mr. Grinde took usthrough the programming chores.andP;  Using a dumb ASCII terminal, Mr. Grindecould program every station set in the ExecuTech 2000 system.andP;  He deftlyassigned line keys, call forwarding, privacy buttons and other classes ofservice via a simple, menu-driven format.andP;  &quot;After you program a singlestation,&quot; he related, &quot;you can copy its feature assignments to as many otherstations as you like.&quot;andP;  Very convenient.andM;For client billing and company review, the ExecuTech 2000 provides somecomprehensive call accounting and SMDA capabilities.andP;  Explains Mr. Grinde --&quot;Call costing tables are harbored right in KSU.andP;  You can program the area andoffice codes directly into the system.&quot;andP;  The Executech 2000 can accommodateup to 33 different tables.andM;Seven bands are also available to document local calls.andP;  In New York, forexample, you'd program in seven of the local establishments you routinelyplace calls to.andM;As long distance rates have fallen, local costs have risen steadily.andP;  Thisfeature allows you to keep track of them, and bill them to your clients ifappropriate.andM;Up to 1,800 call records can be stored in two larger Executech 2000 switches.andM;The junior model will accommodate a respectable 900.andP;  You can program thesystem to print the records out at midnight, when the coffers are 95% full oras needed.andP;  Reports can be arranged by trunk, account code or by department.andO;For telemarketing applications, the Executech 2000 keeps track of inboundtraffic for each department, as well as outbound calls emanating therefrom.andM;The Executech furnishes some additional call costing features at the stationlevel.andP;  Like a taxi meter, the Executech LCD set gives you a running tally ofthe cost of your call -- as you're making it.andP;  Every 20 seconds, the dollarvalue of your call is updated on the LCD screen.andM;&quot;For many people, 10 minutes is not as meaningful as 92 cents,&quot; Mr. Grindeexplains.andP;  &quot;By replacing the traditional call duration clock with thecumulative cost, employees will be made more conscious of just how much ofthe company's money they are spending every time they pick up the phone.&quot;andM;After you hang up, the final cost of your call is displayed on the LCDscreen.andP;  You can jot it down for your own client records on the spot.andP;  Or,should you forget to glean the information immediately, you can recover itsimply by hitting your &quot;hold&quot; button.andM;A third generation hybrid, the Executech 2000 boasts several capabilitiesnever before available on a Comdial system.andP;  The following are among the mostintriguing new developments:andM;* LED Buttons For Status Indications and Programming: Unlike many proprietarysets, the Executech 2000 phones can give you status indications on their busylamp fields.andP;  You don't need a fancy liquid crystal display to tell youwhether your calls are currently being forwarded or whether you've enteredthe do-not-disturb mode.andP;  The LED buttons tell all.andM;Similarly, you can do all station programming without the luxury of an LCD.andO;Once you're in the programming mode, you simply press the LED button thatcorresponds to the programmable function you desire.andM;Let's give an example.andP;  In the hold recall programming mode, each buttoncorresponds to a different time value.andP;  One lit LED button indicates a20-second hold recall time, while the one below it denotes a 25-second value.andO;To select a particular time, simply press the appropriate button and the lamplight will go on.andP;  An instruction manual gives you the value of each LED keyfor each programmable function.andM;* Secured Off-Hook Voice Announce (SOHVA).andP;  This feature allows you to talkto a busy station without being heard by the outside party.andP;  To round outthis picture of total confidentially, you can't hear the outside partyeither.andP;  SOHVA is especially useful for telemarketing applications andboss/secretary exchanges.andM;Here's how it works.andP;  Your colleague Tom is on the phone with an importantcustomer.andP;  You realize that: Tom missed the last sales meeting; and heprobably still doesn't know that your company raised its distributor prices.andO;You're afraid he might offer this caller a promise he can't deliver on.andM;You call Tom over the SOHVA circuit.andP;  He's alerted to your call by sixdistinctive bursts on the line.andP;  Once he knows you're there, he can eitherpress the mute button and talk to you, while his caller chatters on, orselect any of 10 messages from a message bin and send it to your LCD screen.andO;The second he sends that message, he automatically breaks off that intercompath between the two of you.andM;* Service Observing.andP;  As Tom Grinde explained, &quot;service observing allows youradministrator-manager-slavedriver to go into a call without being announcedand without emitting any tell-tale tones to alert either the employee or hiscaller that they're under observation.&quot;andP;  The feature is geared to call-centerenvironments and employee-training programs.andM;&quot;Whoa,&quot; we exclaimed after seeing this one in action.andP;  &quot;Doesn't serviceobserving have some profound First Amendment implications?&quot;andM;Mr.andP;  Grinde agreed that it might.andP;  However, he notes that Comdial in the pasthad lost sales to systems that had this feature.andP;  He noted that &quot;it is up tothe customer to determine whether he requires service observing.&quot;andM;As a class of service, service observing can be exercised during theinstallation process.andP;  Thus, if the customer so chooses, the feature neednever see the light of day.andP;  And if he wants it, well then, that's hisprerogative.andM;* No-frills Proprietary Sets.andP;  &quot;In the past,&quot; Mr. McDonald asserts, &quot;ourcompany was known for low-priced KSUs and higher-priced telephones.andP;  The ideabeing that we are competitive at install side, and retain higher salesmargins for adds, moves and changes.&quot;andM;Now, for the Executech 2000, Comdial has introduced some narrower imagephones.andP;  They now offer single-line, two-line, six-line and 14-line sets withthe new nofrills design.andP;  These phones have a smaller footprint than previousofferings, more modest cabinetry and a lower base sticker price.andM;Fortunately, Comdial also offers a line of prestige phones for use with theExecutech 2000.andP;  Luxury edition 22-button sets, speakerphones and LCD displaysets are also available.andM;* Voice Mail Integration.andP;  The Executech 2000 can tightly integrate withComdial's Execumail voice mail product.andP;  Execumail can screen calls for youwhen you're at your desk and take messages while you're away.andP;  The system canalso loosely integrate with most auto attendants.andM;Our initial impression of the ExecuTech 2000?andP;  Overall, it was quitefavorable.andP;  Rarely have we seen such comprehensive telemarketing applicationsin such a small system.andP;  And as usual Comdial proprietary instruments did notdisappoint.andP;  Their handsets are among the most solid in the industry.andP;  Theirchassis are elegantly designed, their button fields sensibly arranged.andP;  And,as always, the acoustics are first rate.andP;  Even the new no-nonsense setscompare favorably against other company's top-of-the-line models.andM;Like all Comdial products, the ExecuTech 2000 is made in the USA, and thusexempt from the anti-dumping tariffs.andM;Thumbs up America!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
