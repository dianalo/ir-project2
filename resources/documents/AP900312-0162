(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Los Angeles Raiders owner Al Davis saidMonday he wants to bring the National Football League team back tothe city he abandoned eight years ago.   Davis, breaking a long silence on the issue, called localofficials to lend his support to Oakland's offer.   The proposal, which guarantees Davis' Raiders $602 million over15 years, now needs only the approval of the City Council andAlameda County supervisors.   ``He's ready, and we're ready,'' said Mayor Lionel Wilson.``This is an eventful day in history for this city.''   The separate votes were scheduled for Monday night following ahearing, but the possibility that testimony would be lengthythreatened to force a vote postponement.   If Davis, the Raiders' managing general partner, had said noMonday or failed to call by a noon deadline, the deal would havebeen off.   The NFL formally requires approval by three-fourths of teamowners of any move, as well as written notification by Jan. 15 ofthe year of the proposed relocation. But in practice, the leagueposes no further obstacles if the city and county approve the offer.   Davis moved the Raiders from Oakland to Los Angeles withoutpermission, and won his case in court, and Robert Irsay moved theColts without approval from Baltimore to Indianapolis in 1984. NFLowners did approve the 1988 transfer of the Cardinals franchisefrom St. Louis to Phoenix.   The Raiders' lease with the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum runsthrough the 1991 season, but it's possible Davis could seek asettlement enabling him to return to Oakland sooner.   Officials in Los Angeles worked through the weekend to puttogether a counteroffer, but were pessimistic about their chances.   ``It looks like we're going to lose the Raiders,'' said EdSnider, lead negotiator for the Los Angeles Coliseum's privatemanagers. ``It's a damn shame. I haven't given up, but I fear we'rea day late and a dollar short.''   Oakland's offer includes a loan package totaling $121 million tothe team. It proposes $53.5 million to renovate the OaklandColiseum and the rest a ``loan'' Davis does not have to repay.   Davis also would be guaranteed ticket revenues of at least $29million a year for the life of the 15-year lease. He would receivethe basic $30 ticket price from at least 57,000 seats, with thecity and county taking the premium payments above that for certaincategories of seats.   He also would keep all television, which currently is $32million a year.   For the city and county to make money, the team must average 90percent of capacity in a renovated Coliseum that will hold 63,500.About 37,000 seats will cost more than the $30 base ticket price;many require fans to pay $2,000 to $16,000 up front.   In light of those requirements, many local officials questionwhether there are enough sports fan dollars in the Bay area tosupport another pro team.   ``This deal is a gamble not worth getting into,'' said citycouncilman Wilson Riles Jr. ``The risks are just too high.''   If the Raiders return, they must compete with three championshipprofessional teams _ the Oakland Athletics, San Francisco 49ers andSan Francisco Giants _ and a fourth, the Warriors, that routinelysells out.</TEXT></DOC>
