Both sides are making strike preparations as relationsgrow more acrimonious, but many people inside and outside thecarrier, a unit of AMR Corp., suggest privately that theairline's management and labor leaders could merely beposturing.</LP><TEXT>   What is certain is that American, which fueled itsphenonmenal 1980s growth with a labor cost advantage, facesgiving up some of that edge to satisfy Allied PilotsAssociation demands. At issue is the carrier's controversialtwo-tier wage system for pilots that the union says puts mostof American's cockpit crews near the bottom of the industrypay scale.   An American captain, with about a dozen years ofseniority, is paid on average $124,697 a year, according tothe company. The average pay for first officers is $54,614and for entry-level flight engineers, $25,879. Seniority, thekind of plane being flown and a pilot's position are allfactors in determining pay.   The APA representatives and American officials arecurrently closeted in Washington, D.C., where federalmediators have been monitoring round-the-clock talks sinceJan. 7. The union's board is deciding today whether topresent the company's third -- and the company says final --proposal to union members for a vote.   In 15 months, the union has dismissed two contract offersas inadequate and people familiar with the latest round ofnegotiations say the two sides are still far apart on manymajor issues.   &quot;We're making minor progress on minor issues,&quot; said oneparticipant in the talks.   American's contract with its pilots expired at the end of1989, but, by law, the airline abides by provisions of theold contract while it negotiates a new one -- or untilfederal mediators decide talks are at an impasse. Then theNational Mediation Board starts a 30-day countdown, afterwhich the company can impose its own contract, and the unionis free to strike.   Some participants and observers of the American talks saythe NMB could declare an impasse within the week if theunion's board refuses to take the latest proposal to themembership. The pilots' union has prepared strike ballots,but won't send them to members unless today's board meetingmakes it necessary.   American devised its two-tier pay system in 1983 to helpbankroll its ambitious $20 billion-plus expansion plans. Muchof the rest of the airline industry rushed to mimic theAmerican pattern, but other carriers have since narrowed thedifference between the two tiers.   At American, lower-paid &quot;B-scale&quot; pilots, whosignificantly outnumber &quot;A-scale&quot; pilots, replaced theunion's low-key negotiating committee with hardliners who areseeking to remedy the lower pay, smaller pension and shortervacations. APA, once considered a docile in-house union,agitated for a hefty pay and benefits increase that Americanclaims it can't afford if its growth plan is to stay ontrack.   American says it simply can't afford what the pilots want-- a contract to rival the industry's most expensive pact,between Delta Air Lines and its pilots. &quot;We think it islong-term, the wrong thing to do,&quot; said Robert W. Baker,American's executive vice president of operations at both theairline and parent, AMR Corp. &quot;We'd really be signing up forthe eventual dismemberment of the company because we can'tsustain profitability at those pay levels.&quot;   The pilots say that American is just poor-mouthing andthey don't agree with AMR's negative outlook. The airlineproved in 1988 and 1989 it could post huge profits, they say,and the current downturn in the airline industry -- includingAmerican's $215.1 million fourth-quarter loss -- istemporary. &quot;Our pay, across the board, is rock bottom,&quot; saida union board member. The fourth-quarter loss wiped outearlier profits for the year and resulted in a $39.6 millionannual loss for 1990.   Pilots always know what their compatriots at othercarriers get paid, and each new pilots contract becomes ablueprint for the next. &quot;For the first nine or 10 months ofnegotiations, all we heard was Northwest, Northwest,Northwest -- you've got to pay us what Northwest pays theirguys,&quot; said Mr. Baker. Then late last summer, Delta signed anexpensive new pilots contract with a big pay jump and aB-scale that merged into A-scale in the shortest time for theindustry. Within weeks, says Mr. Baker, &quot;we started hearingfrom our pilots, Delta, Delta, Delta.&quot;   In November, American offered a package similar toNorthwest's for top pilots with a shot at Delta's levels ofpay if American matched its record-setting profits of 1988.But pilots with less seniority didn't benefit as much andtheir reaction to the proposal was a swift thumbs-down. Mr.Baker said that later that month, he sent a letter out to all8,800 pilots saying, &quot;You might as well understand, guys,you're not going to get Delta rates.&quot;   &quot;The mood {among pilots} shifted after that,&quot; said aB-scale pilot, who asked not to be identified. &quot;Now, nobody'shappy with the company.&quot;   Last week, pilot negotiators backed away from theirdemands for parity with Delta pilots. According to aparticipant in the talks, the pilots said they would acceptDelta rates less 2%. It isn't clear what management'sresponse has been.   In addition to the pay issue, the pilots opposemanagement's proposal for &quot;cafeteria-style&quot; flexible medicalbenefits. No other pilots union has accepted such a package,and the APA is unwilling to be the first, although American'sTransport Workers Union and its noncontract workers have sucha plan. And where management has offered to pay B-scalers anA-scale wage after six years instead of the current nine, thepilots want the scales to merge in four years. Management hasalready agreed to bring pension contributions for B-scalepilots up to A-scale levels.   The carrier believes it's ready for a strike. &quot;We have aplan for everything,&quot; said Mr. Baker. Much of its strategycomes from two run-throughs in recent years with other laborgroups. When negotiations bogged down with the TransportWorkers Union in 1989, American had gone so far as to hireand train replacements. In 1987, American reached agreementon a contract with flight attendants three hours before ascheduled walkout.   The pilots are also preparing. Pilots who were veterans ofstrikes at Eastern Airlines, United Airlines and Northwesthave huddled with American's pilots to provide informationand strategy.   The brawl has become increasingly nasty and public. Overthe Christmas holidays, American, in court and inadvertisements, accused the pilots union of conducting anillegal sickout and work slowdown to influence thenegotiations. The pilots denied any slowdown had taken place.American also announced flight cutbacks of 11% earlier thismonth, saying the pilot slowdown made them necessary. Pilotssay they are being used as a excuse, that a drop-off inairline traffic is the culprit.   The pilots are fighting back, too. The union has releaseda letter its president, Fred Vogel, wrote to the FederalAviation Administration alleging American's ground crews makefrequent mistakes when figuring the weight of departingaircraft. Such errors, the union claimed, &quot;demonstrate agrowing loss of safety and increasing numbers of flightswhere the public has been endangered,&quot; according to theletter. American denies any problem with its ground crews.   The FAA has had no comment on Mr. Vogel's letter.   ---   American Airlines' pilots, by pay scale, in numbers ofpilots                                                                                                                &quot;A&quot; scale                     3,300 pilots</TEXT></DOC>
