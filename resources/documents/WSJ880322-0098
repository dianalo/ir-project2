The first unit of the two-reactor nuclear plant project, operated by Houston Lighting andamp; Power Co., has had its 5% low-power testing license since last August. But its full-power license was held up by nagging equipment problems and a pending NRC investigation of safety allegations raised by a Washington-based watchdog group.    The company is a unit of Houston Industries Inc., Houston.    The plant, which is seven years late and more than 500% over budget, can begin commercial operation within days, though at first it will operate at up to 50% power so managers can test its performance, said Jerry Goldberg, a Houston Lighting vice president.    As reported earlier, an NRC safety team last week reported finding no technically oriented safety problems at the Bay City, Texas, plant 90 miles southwest of Houston.    The NRC voted to grant an operating license even though its Office of Investigations is still reviewing allegations that workers who reported irregularities at the plant were harassed or intimidated by company officials, as well as other alleged wrongdoings. However, Jose Calvo, an NRC official, assured the commission yesterday that none of those allegations presented safety concerns, pertained to design flaws or showed a pattern of unsafe management behavior.    &quot;If any of those allegations would turn up anything of a safety nature, we would take appropriate action,&quot; NRC Chairman Lando Zech told reporters after the vote. But, he said, staff findings show that &quot;substantive safety concerns have been resolved and the public health and safety will be protected.&quot;    The Government Accountability Project, the public-interest law firm that alleged some 700 irregularities at the plant, said it will challenge the NRC's action in federal appeals court in Washington on grounds its investigation was incomplete and inadequate. The allegations, based largely on accounts from current and former plant workers, included charges of safety and quality-assurance violations from 1982 through 1987.    NRC Commissioner Frederick Bernthal challenged the GAP's complaints. He said the agency spent $250,000 and a &quot;good deal of time and effort . . to resolve these allegations.&quot;    The nuclear plant, begun in 1975, has been delayed by construction problems, including the switching of construction contractors in 1981.    Houston Lighting has a 31% stake in the plant, though its interest may increase to 47% under a tentative agreement in which the city of Austin would drop a lawsuit against the Houston utility and bail out of its 16% holding. The city of San Antonio has a 28% stake and Central Power andamp; Light Co. of Corpus Christi, a unit of Dallas-based Central andamp; South West Corp., owns 25%.    The nuclear plant's second unit is 91% complete and, after licensing, is scheduled to begin commercial operation next year. </TEXT></DOC>
