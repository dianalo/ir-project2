The rally eased interest rates in the credit markets and helpedcause a huge drop in commodity prices. Gold in particular was hurt,falling $3 to a late bid of $364.50 a troy ounce, Republic NationalBank of New York reported. The White House issued a statement onthe dollar, its first since President Bush took office, warningthat a further increase in the currency could ``undermineinternational efforts to reduce global trade imbalances.''   The statement was in conjuction with repeated dollar-sellingefforts by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and severalEuropean central banks. The dollar eased slightly from its highestlevels, but currency analysts attributed that to speculatorscashing profits on the dollar's persistent rally.   Currency analysts said the market perceives weakness between theUnited States and its six key trading partners, known as the Groupof Seven, in foreign-exchange policies, despite official statementsto the contrary. Dealers said that was a key element behind thedollar's strong gains Monday.   Supporting that sentiment was a story in Monday's New York Timesthat said some U.S. officials would prefer to rely less heavily onintervention and shift to a more flexible dollar policy.   In addition, West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehlsaid in an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde he thoughtrecent interventions have proven ineffective and that his countrycould live with the firmer dollar. The Bundesbank was conspiciouslyabsent from Monday's intervention.   ``The market seems to be focusing on disarray in the G-7,'' saidMarc Chandler, a currency analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. inChicago.   However, some analysts contend there's little the G-7 can doright now to re-direct the dollar, unless major economic policychanges are made.   ``I think they (G-7 officials) are encountering a situation notunlike the situation confronting the Chinese government,'' saidDavid H. Resler, chief economist for Nomura Securities Inc. in NewYork.   ``They have this huge public sentiment out there that is beingexpressed in ways not to their liking but there's not much they cando about it.''   The United States could depress the dollar by easing creditpolicies, but that could undermine its inflation-fighting efforts,analysts said. High U.S. interest rates, in comparison to thoseoverseas, make investments like bonds more attractive toforeigners, thereby increasing the need to convert their currenciesto dollars.   Also supporting the dollar are growing inflation abroad andpolitical uncertainty in West Germany and Japan, analysts said. Theunrest in China also was having a positive effect on the dollar,they said.   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business daybegins, the dollar soared despite sizeable Bank of Japanintervention, closing 1.68 yen higher at 140.45 yen, the first timethe dollar has closed above 140 yen since Oct. 28, 1987. It wasquoted at 142.05 yen in London, and 142.05 yen in New York, up from139.05 Friday.   In London, the dollar rose to its highest level since August1987. It cost $1.5810 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6190 lateFriday. Sterling fetched $1.5755 in New York, down from $1.6120.   The dollar also pushed through the 2-West German mark level forthe first time since December 1986.
