With 80 percent of the Republican precincts reporting _ the lastofficial tally provided early today _ Dole had 43 percent;Robertson, 28 percent; Kemp, 15 percent; and Bush, 11 percent. Theuncommitteds were 3 percent.   And with 74 percent of the Democratic precincts reporting,Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, scored 34 percent; JesseJackson had 20 percent, Sen. Paul Simon, 18 percent and Rep.Richard Gephardt, 8 percent. Gore and Hart each had 1 percent, and19 percent were uncommitted.   Gephardt won the South Dakota primary Tuesday night, setting thescene for more battles for the front-running spot as he and Dukakishead into a new round of contests.   Dukakis won last week's New Hampshire primary, while Gephardtwas the victor in the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 8.   Both Gore and Jackson have been campaigning heavily in theSouth, and Gore, who bypassed Iowa and New Hampshire, is vowing tocome on strong in his native region.   Gore, along with Hart, virtually ignored Minnesota.   Bush, the Republican front-runner nationwide, made no effort inMinnesota. In Kentucky, where he was campaigning, he went to bedTuesday night without commenting to reporters on the returns.   For the first time in Minnesota, an attempt was being made toreport results of the caucuses on the night they occurred _ meaningthe preferences of all those who attended Republican caucuses basedon a straw poll and the preferences of delegates elected at theDemocratic caucuses.   The caucuses began the process of selecting 78 of the state's87-member delegation to the Democratic National Convention and the31 delegates to the Republican National Convention.   Moving the caucus date from March to February resulted in alengthy dispute between the state and national Democratic partiesbecause the new date is earlier than national party rules allow.   The state party agreed that a presidential preference poll takenat the Democratic caucuses would be kept secret until 5 p.m. March8 and that the state party would not cooperate in reporting ofcaucus-night results.</TEXT></DOC>
