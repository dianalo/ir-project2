Three different methodsof treatment were used: (1) Radiation subsequent to enucleation usinga total dose of 60 Gy (1977-1980). (2) Radiation before as well as afterenucleation using doses of 12 and 50 Gy, respectively (1980-1982). (3)Radiation solely prior to enucleation or block excision using doses of12 or 20 Gy (1980-1982). For clinical assessment, the patients were mainlyclassified according to tumour size and tumour localisation, histology,survival rates and the presence of remote metastases. The % proportionof undesirable responses to radiation was determined separately for eachof the three methods of treatment. It was established that radiotherapycarried out solely before enucleation or block excision was associatedwith considerably lower an incidence of side-effects as compared to radiationbefore and after enucleation or only subsequent to surgery.</TEXT></DOC>
