<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-85-0076 </DOCNO><TEXT>The probability that bone-marrow transplantation will be beneficial afternuclear accidents depends on several factors, including circumstancesof the accident, degree of damage in other body systems, and radiationdose. Transplant-related variables, such as donor-recipient histocompatibilityand post-transplant immune suppression, are also important. The benefitsof transplantation may result from transient or permanent haemopoieticreconstitution. The balance of potential benefits versus risks shouldbe individually calculated for each accident and each patient; generalisationsare likely to result in untenable conclusions.</TEXT></DOC>
