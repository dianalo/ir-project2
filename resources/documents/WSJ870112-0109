IbrahimStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTPETROLEUM (PET)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><TEXT>   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' plan to boost oil prices is succeeding through a combination of production cuts and the imposition of fixed prices in new contracts with buyers.    By far the toughest enforcer of the December agreement, which calls for fixed prices at around $18 a barrel, has been Saudi Arabia. The country has cut its oil production about 20% as of Jan. 1 to an estimated 3.4 million barrels a day.    Moreover, oil industry sources said Saudi Arabia, the cartel's largest producer, is demanding that new contracts starting Feb. 1 with a duration of five months be signed by all buyers at fixed prices near the $18-a-barrel benchmark. Other OPEC members are expected to follow.    This would cover the period through June when OPEC is scheduled to meet to reexamine its production and pricing plans.    &quot;OPEC's plans are holding up pretty well,&quot; said the chief London trader of a major American oil company who asked not to be identified. &quot;So far so good.&quot;    As a result of Saudi and the other OPEC members' discipline in lowering oil production, prices have moved to their highest level in months. In the U.S. oil market, the benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, has passed the $18 level, trading Friday on spot markets at $18.75, up 20 cents, the highest level in nearly a year. Just before OPEC announced its December agreement, U.S. spot crude oil prices hovered at $16 a barrel.    Many industry officials now are convinced that prices will remain just under $20 a barrel over the next few months.    Ralph E. Bailey, chairman of Conoco Inc., the Du Pont Co. unit, said that if OPEC maintains its resolve over the next few months, &quot;the major downward pressures on prices will have been alleviated,&quot; bringing the oil market to &quot;a reasonably balanced position of supply and demand.&quot;    The seriousness of the OPEC endeavor to support the $18 price level is underlined by the fact that Iraq, which refused to participate in the December agreement, has notified customers it will sell oil in line with the fixed prices applied by the other 12 cartel members.    Industry sources said Iraq's State Marketing Organization fixed the price for its crude known as Kirkuk at $17.60 a barrel and its Basrah Light crude at $17.30 a barrel. These prices correspond to the theoretical benchmark price of $18 a barrel, which allows small differentials up or down depending on the quality of crude and its geographical proximity to oil markets.    Another major OPEC country, Kuwait, has told customers who resisted its new fixed prices that their contracts will be terminated. &quot;There will be no bargaining on these prices, and the customers have the choice of either accepting or rejecting them,&quot; Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, the country's oil minister, stated to the Kuwaiti press.    Mr. Bailey and other industry officials said the companies' large excess oil inventories are being slowly worked off, with the reduced OPEC production.    Altogether, OPEC's production cuts have taken about one million barrels of oil a day off the world market. The impact is magnified by rising seasonal winter demand, but moderated by the inventories, which were estimated at about 300 million barrels late last year. &quot;If these inventories weren't there, prices would have crossed the $20 (a barrel) line,&quot; the London-based trader said.    Experts are divided about what will happen in March, when oil demand falls off with the end of the heating season and before the summer travel season begins. Many are inclined to the view that if OPEC sticks to its production discipline, prices may weather the anticipated fall in demand. Others feel some instability is inevitable.    In a recent, but little noticed, interview with the French news agency, Agence France-Presse, from a Swiss ski resort, former Saudi oil minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani said prices will fall in March. But the Saudi minister, who was allowed to leave Saudi Arabia last month after a period of restriction on his travels, seemed to retreat from the comment made informally to the reporter, Ian Christensen, who was on vacation at the same resort.    Last Thursday, he told a correspondent of AP-Dow Jones that he hasn't any comments on the OPEC agreement nor any views on the subject of oil prices except that he favors stability. Saudi sources ascertained that Mr. Yamani is under strict orders from King Fahd to refrain from any comments on the kingdom's oil policy if he wishes to retain his freedom of movement. </TEXT></DOC>
