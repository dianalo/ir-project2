Responding to questions in July and early August,businesses said they planned to raise capital spending 5.4%this year. That compares with the 6.8% increase projectedwhen they were last asked about their plans, in April andMay, and the 8.1% rise they forecast at the beginning of theyear.</LP><TEXT>   The results reflect growing concern about the economy,which has made businesses increasingly reluctant to commit tobig investments.   The cutbacks could be sowing the seeds of problems beyondthe capital-goods industries. Economists say curbingexpenditures on new plant and equipment now will impedefuture economic growth and efficiency.   &quot;If we curtail capital spending, we won't be building theproductivity enhancement and the technology to improveinternational competitiveness,&quot; said Joseph Duncan, chiefeconomist at Dun andamp; Bradstreet in New York. &quot;I worry we'lllose that international edge if businesses cut backinvestment.&quot;   If businesses follow through on the plans reported on thesurvey, 1990 will see a sharp slowdown in capital spendingfrom recent years' levels.   U.S. businesses have gone through something of acapital-spending boom over the past two years. In 1989,despite evidence of a slowing economy, they bolstered capitalspending by 11.4%; in 1988, the increase was 11%.   After adjusting for inflation, the planned rise in capitalspending this year would amount to a 5.1% increase from lastyear, compared with gains of 10.4% in 1989 and 9.5% in 1988.   Several important industries are planning actual decreasesin capital spending this year, according to the report,including the auto industry and makers of nonelectricalmachinery, a category that includes computers.   But auto makers aren't planning nearly as big a cut asthey were at the start of the year. In the July-Augustsurvey, car manufacturers expected spending on new plant andequipment to slip just 0.6% this year, compared with planneddeclines of 6% in the April-May survey and 11.2% in theJanuary-March survey.   The industries planning the biggest increases are paper,electrical machinery and nonferrous metals.   The Commerce Department surveys were mailed to businessesJune 30 with an Aug. 1 due date. Although some weren'treturned until mid-August, most of the responses were madebefore Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, which has threatenedthe economy by driving up world oil prices.   Surveys are already showing that consumer confidence hasplummeted in the wake of spiraling oil prices. Some analystsbelieve businesses also may become increasingly nervous aboutthe economic outlook, and that could curb capital spendingfurther.
