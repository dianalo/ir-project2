In the energy sector, for example, no tariffs are imposedon electricity, uranium, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, with theexception of the customer user fee which applies to exports generally.One other regulatory issue that has been of concern to Canada recentlyis raised in the Agreement, concerning the relationship between U.S.regulatory authorities (especially the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission- FERC) and Canada's National Energy Board. Specifically, to what extentcan FERC extend its jurisdiction so as to affect Canadian resources policies?While the possible conflict between Canadian and American regulatoryauthorities holds some potential significance for the energy sector,clearly the greater concerns of Canadian resource exporters in recentyears have concerned more traditional NTM issues.</TEXT></DOC>
