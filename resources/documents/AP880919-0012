A storm over west-central Montana produced enough snow and rainthat fire crews were allowed to begin returning home. Idaho gotlittle precipitation and crews faced some new fires.   The 8,700-acre brush fire near Vacaville, southwest ofSacramento, led to the evacuation of 65 people from 12 homes andburned at least nine homes, in addition to two outbuildings, saidCalifornia Department of Forestry spokeswoman Dianne Sanders.   The fire apparently was set by an arsonist, Department ofForestry investigator Loyde Johnson said, but he would notelaborate.   Winds, which earlier in the day had gusted up to 35 mph,decreased later in the day, making firefighters hopeful they wouldbe able to gain the upper hand by nightfall.   ``It's looking better because of the change in the wind down toabout 12 miles per hour, so we're able to get in there finally withbulldozers and hand crews,'' said John Ferreira, another forestryspokesman, late Sunday afternoon. ``It's laid down quite a bitnow.''   The wind-swept flames also threatened about 50 other homes inthe area about 55 miles northeast of San Francisco, forestdepartment spokesman John Ferreria said.   Vacaville Fire Chief Howard Wood said several radio towers weredamaged by the fire on top of Mount Vaca. Two people sufferedburns, he said.   North of Vacaville, six homes were destroyed as about 7,000acres burned Sunday east of Redding and 40 to 50 families wereevacuated from the small communities of Whitmore and Oak Run,California forestry spokeswoman Lisa Chiesa said.   An additional 85 people were evacuated from a private schoolcalled the Cascade School, said spokeswoman Evelyn Dollarhide.Twelve outbuildings were destroyed, including a barn containingseveral classic cars, officials said.   Fighting the fire was difficult because of dry timber and windgusting up to 45 mph, Chiesa said.   Up to 6 inches of snow had been forecast for Yellowstone, innorthwestern Wyoming, but most of the park got only a dusting.   However, by midday the temperature was still only 37 degrees,limiting fire activity and allowing crews to jump on hot spotsbefore they had a chance to get out of hand, said fire informationofficer Judy Jennings.   The park has been besieged for nearly three months by dryweather and fires that have charred more than half its 2.2 millionacres.   Jennings said crews on many fires would hold off on buildingcontainment lines.   ``There's really no need for it right now. Fire activity is lowin most locations throughout the park,'' she said.   And in any event, fire managers have said the terrain and accessaround parts of the 335,300-acre North Fork blaze make buildingcontainment lines there extremely difficult. Natural barrierssurrounding the fire were expected to help keep it in line.   In west-central Montana, firefighting crews and the soldiers whoreinforced them began pulling out of the 247,000-acre Canyon Creekfire Sunday while a storm continued to drop snow and rain.Officials said the force would be replaced by 20-memberrapid-response teams in each of the three national forests that thefire affected: Lolo, Lewis and Clark and Helena.   Some firefighters also were being released Sunday from the35,400-acre Red Bench fire in and near Glacier National Park, saidfire information officer Jim Payne. He said hotspots and thepotential for renewed trouble remained.   Glacier officials said snow and rain had reduced fire dangerenough to allow reopening of backcountry trails and campgrounds,but with some restrictions.   A weather front that moved over Idaho on Saturday broughtdisappointingly light precipitation, and firefighters had two newfires that started Friday and Saturday, one caused by lightning,said Nez Perce National Forest spokeswoman Mary Zabinski.   But high humidity and temperatures in the 40s helpedfirefighters in their effort to keep most Idaho wildfires withinthe boundaries of the Frank Church-River of No Return, Gospel Humpand Selway-Bitterroot wilderness areas.</TEXT></DOC>
