Not long after the Reagans arrived by motorcade from VnukovoAirport outside Moscow, they walked across a long red carpet to thecenter of a 200-foot-long chandaliered and gilded reception room inSt. George's Hall, where their paths crossed Gorbachev's and hiswife's.   Gorbachev and Reagan reminisced briefly about earlier summits inGeneva, Reykjavik, Iceland and Washington, while their wives, NancyReagan and Raisa Gorbachev, looked on in an inside-the-Kremlinscene broadcast live by Soviet television and seen by millions inthe United States and around the world.   Reagan, who once called the Soviet Union an ``evil empire,'' hadarrived on Soviet soil for the first time, under sunny skies, justafter 2 p.m. local time. He was greeted there by Soviet PresidentAndrei Gromyko, for years the foreign minister, and Gromyko's wife,Lidia, who gave a bouquet of roses to Mrs. Reagan.   Amid mixed expectations about the success of the five days oftalks, coming in the wake of problems with secondary arms-controlmeasures and new Soviet complaints of continuing U.S. aid to Afghanrebels, Gorbachev set a conciliatory tone, telling Reagan that``important tasks lie ahead.''   ``You and I are conscious of our two people's longing for mutualunderstanding, cooperation and a safe world,'' said Gorbachev,speaking through an interpreter. ``This makes it incumbent upon usto discuss ... the major aspects of disarmament.''   Reagan told his Soviet counterpart that U.S.-Soviet relationshave improved since their first meeting, in Geneva in November1985, saying ``we have taken our work, step by step, and I havecome here to continue that work.''   Inside the Kremlin, Gorbachev seemed to gently tweak Reaganabout the president's many speeches and jokes about life in theSoviet Union.   ``Mr. President, you and Mrs. Reagan are here on your firstvisit to the Soviet Union, a country which you have so oftenmentioned in your public statements ... Let me add another to yourcollection, `It is better to see once than to hear a hundredtimes.'''   Reagan had his own proverb for Gorbachev.   Speaking of the gradual progress in superpower relations overrecent years, and noting that differences remain, Reagan, speakingfirst in Russian, told Gorbachev: ``Rodilsya, ne toropilsya,'' or``It was born. It wasn't rushed.''   ``Mr. General Secretary, we did not rush. We have taken our workstep by step, and I have come here to continue that work. We bothknow it will not be easy.''   Sitting down with Gorbachev for a picture-taking session at theoutset of their first meeting, Reagan was asked whether he intendedto lecture the Kremlin leader about human rights.   ``I have no intention of trying to be a teacher,'' he replied.   The Reagans spent three days in Helsinki, Finland, recuperatingfrom jet lag and preparing for their historic five-day visit toMoscow.   Reporters shouted questions as Reagan posed briefly with Gromykoand other members of the arrival party here.   ``We're getting along just fine,'' Reagan said.   As reporters continued to yell questions, Gromyko turned toReagan and said, ``They want to know in advance everything.   Reagan then shook hands with a host of dignitaries, includingYuri Dubinin, currently the Soviet ambassador to Washington, andpaused briefly while standing under the Soviet flag bearing thehammer and sickle. Reagan stood before march Soviet troops,swinging their legs in the traditional Russaian military goose-stepfashion.   Reagan's chief of staff, Howard H. Baker Jr. arrived in Helsinkion an overnight flight from Washington, bringing with him the newlyratified Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty (INF).   Baker carried two bulging briefcases into the VIP lounge at theHelsinki airport, where he waited to link up with Reagan for theflight to Moscow.   Reagan and Gorbachev will exchange ratification documents duringa Kremlin ceremony Wednesday morning. It is the first ratifiedsuperpower arms treaty in 16 years, the first major arms controlagreement of the Reagan administration and the only treaty to banan entire class of nuclear weapons.   The exchange ceremony substitutes for the previously hoped-forsigning of an agreement slashing by half the arsenals of strategicnuclear weapons _ the most powerful and dangerous in the superpowerarsenals.   The U.S. Senate voted 93-5 on Friday to approve the INF treaty,signed by Reagan and Gorbachev at their Washington December summit.In a rare televised session, the Soviet Union's collectivepresidency unanimously ratified the pact 17 hours later.   In a pre-summit snag, U.S. officials revealed that chances hadevaporated for signing an agreement on advance notification ofballistic missile tests by the superpowers. And they said twolesser arms-control measures may not be ready for signing duringReagan's talks with Gorbachev.   The agreements, while not major, would have given the leadersgrounds to boast of progress on arms control issues _ particularlyin view of the failure of the superpowers to conclude a treaty tocurb strategic nuclear weapons.   Aside from the arms agenda, officials said they did not expect``announceable progress'' on differences on human rights andregional disputes.   Soviet officials, meanwhile, criticized the United States forits insistence on sending U.S. aid to Afghan rebels after thewithdrawal of Red Army troops. And they hinted they might halttheir withdrawal from Afghanistan if neighboring Pakistan failed tostop aiding Afghan rebels.   The Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the Tass news agencyand the evening news show Vremya, took aim at the ``lavish suppliesof U.S. arms to Pakistan, intended specifically for theanti-government Afghan forces.''   The United States has been supplying Afghan rebels with anestimated $500 million annually in arms and other military supplieschanneled through Pakistan. It has pledged to continue to do so aslong as the Soviet Union keeps up its military support of theAfghan government.   Asked about the Soviet comments, Baker told reporters, ``Therelationship between the United States and the Soviet Union iscomplex and spans many issues. A single summit or four summits, aswe've had now, isn't going to solve them all at one time. Thegeneral relationship is better and I think prospects for generalpeace are improved.''   Gerald Ford was the last U.S. president to visit the SovietUnion, traveling to the port of Vladivostock, located on the Sea ofJapan, in 1974. Richard Nixon met the same year in Moscow with thelate Leonid Brezhnev.   Reagan, in an interview with Soviet television broadcast overthe weekend throughout the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, said hecould not have envisioned a trip to Moscow under the Sovietleadership before Gorbachev.   ``Very frankly, I have to say I think there is a differencebetween this general secretary and other leaders of your country.... I don't think they had any dreams of perestroika'' _Gorbachev's program to restructure the nation's troubled economy.</TEXT></DOC>
