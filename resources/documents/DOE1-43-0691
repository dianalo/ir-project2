The study focused on hydrocarbon emissionsand combustion characterization. The chosen sites had a record of smokeand odour complaints. The measurements were performed with a mobile testinglaboratory and included continuous monitoring of exhaust gas temperature,oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and total hydrocarbons (THC).During the stack testing the incinerators were operated by the buildingsuperintendents according to normal practices. The test runs lasted atleast a half hour following ignition. During the first half hour of operationnone of the units met the Ministry's THC emission limit of 100 ppm andonly one did so after this period. THC concentrations from the 11 sitesaveraged 480 ppm as methane equivalent. Average combustion efficiencywas poor (94.0%) as a result of high excess air and low temperatures.Multichamber incinerators performed slightly better than flue fed units.52 figs., 32 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
