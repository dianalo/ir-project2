KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals court Friday threw out a bidby the Urban Mass Transportation Administration to test localtransit system employees for drug use, including random testing.   The U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbiasaid the agency had exceeded its congressionally mandated authorityin trying to impose uniform nationwide rules on local transitauthorities.   ``We believe that Congress intended for such matters to behandled locally with UMTA's guiding hand, not with an iron fist,''the court said in an opinion filed by Chief Judge Patricia M. Wald.   The decison upheld an appeal by transport unions and reversed anearlier decision by the U.S. District Court.   The court battle began shortly after the authority issuedregulations in December 1988 requiring all local transit systemsreceiving federal funds to assure a drug-free workforce.   The regulations, similar to rules established for transportworkers under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation,called for urinalysis testing of employees before employment, afteran accident, when reasonable suspicion of drug use existed,randomly and before an employee suspended for drug use was allowedto return to work.   The Amalgamated Transit Union and the Transport Workers Union ofAmerica contended the transport agency had no authority to impose afederal drug-testing program on all recipients of federal masstransit money.   Jim La Sala, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, saidFriday that the UMTA's attempt to impose national standards was``overkill and not sensitive to local concerns or issues.''   ``Local unions and mass transit employers are well-suited tothemselves reach decisions on drug testing and employee assistanceprograms that reflect each local situation,'' La Sala said. ``Thereis no evidence of widespread drug use nationally in the masstransit industry and the UMTA knows it.''   The opinion said Congress had given local transit authorities,not the federal agency, the power to submit locally designed plansto deal with safety hazards, including drug abuse.   A bid by the federal government to mandate ``a uniform nationalplan that is not in any respect tailored to local needs andcircumstances'' cannot be squared with the language or intent ofthe legislation enacted by Congress, the court said.   ``Unless and until Congress chooses to confer such authority toUMTA over safety matters, UMTA's uniform, national anti-drugprogram regulations do not represent a valid exercise of itsstatutory authority,'' the court said.</TEXT></DOC>
