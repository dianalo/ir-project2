The user, the menu system, and theinteraction between the user and the system were analyzed and characterizedwithin this model. The MENUDA system was developed in an incrementaland systematic fashion within the framework of the UMIRM. The knowledgebase and the user interface of the MENUDA system were developed underan interactive microcomputer environment supported by an expert-systembuilding tool, Texas Instruments Personal Consultant Plus (PC Plus).The inference engine of the MENUDA system was provided by PC Plus. Theknowledge base of the current MENUDA system was divided into the followingthree modules with one or more frames in each module: (1) AlternativeInterface Dialogue Analysis Module, (2) Inter-Frame Menu Structure AnalysisModule, and (3) Menu Breadth and Depth Analysis Module.</TEXT></DOC>
