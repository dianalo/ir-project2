Her remarks were criticized by Anglican church officialsattending a church conference debating whether to accept womenbishops. Many Episcopalians object to the minority of priests whoare women.   ``I personally think there will be women in the priesthood and Ido not myself find it at odds with the Christian doctrine, althoughI accept that some people do,'' Mrs. Thatcher told Australianreporters Friday just before she embarked on a 12-day tour of Asiaand Australia.   She said however, ``I am not going to get involved in what theLambeth Conference decides,'' referring to the three-weekconference which begins its last week Monday with a debate on womenbishops.   Rev. William Oddie, an Oxford University theologian and leadingopponent against the ordination of women, was quoted in the SundayTelegraph newspaper as saying, ``it would have been better if (Mrs.Thatcher) had stayed out'' of the controversy.   ``It is a theological question and not a secular one,'' he wasquoted as saying. ``It is a technical question which is outside hercompetence.''   The Bishop of Leicester, the Right Rev. Richard Rutt, told theTelegraph, ``It is all very well for Mrs. Thatcher to say that theordination of women is not against Christian doctrine, but I do notrecall that she has studied theology.''   The conference in Canterbury has brought together 525 bishopsrepresenting 164 countries, who are meeting for the first time in10 years.   Some 1,200 women have been admitted to the priesthood by aminority of the Anglican churches, most of them in the UnitedStates, Canada and New Zealand. The Archbishop of Canterbury RobertRuncie has warned that although all Anglican churches will probablyaccept women priests, a woman bishop _ now under consideration byEpiscopal churches in the United States and New Zealand _ is likelyto split the worldwide Anglican Communion.   Although the 27 Anglican churches worldwide are self-governing,they look to the Church of England for guidance and Runcie is theworld Anglican leader.</TEXT></DOC>
