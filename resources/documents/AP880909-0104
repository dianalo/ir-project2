In the Persian Gulf state of Abu Dhabi, meanwhile, PLO chairmanYasser Arafat hinted strongly that the Palestine National Council,the PLO's parliament-in-exile, will proclaim a Palestinian stateand form a provisional government when it meets early next month.   The Al-Khaleej daily quoted him as saying: ``The Palestinianleadership is about to take decisive moves which will have along-term impact affecting not only the Palestinian and Arab level,but also the international level.''   As the political momentum increased, Bassam Abu Sharif, a closeArafat aide, said the Israeli government has escalated its effortsto crush a 9-month-old Palestinian uprising in the West bank andGaza Strip.   The Israeli army said 200 Palestine Liberation Organizationactivists were rounded up in Gaza today. It claimed to have smasheda clandestine network behind a wave of firebomb attacks.   Speaking by telephone from Tunis, the PLO's headquarters, AbuSharif said Israeli troops have stormed Palestinian villages andcamps in an intensified effort to quell the uprising before thePalestinian council convenes.   Palestinian sources said the 450-member council will meet inAlgiers Oct.5.   Informed sources at the non-aligned foreign ministers conferencein Nicosia said the Palestine resolution was expected to beendorsed ``without reservation'' at a plenary session Saturday,when the conference ends.   The resolution also called for the 101-member non-alignedmovement to financially aid the Palestinian uprising in theoccupied territories.   The uprising, and Jordan's July 31 decision to severe legal andadministrative claims on the West Bank, have given impetus to movesto declare an independent state and a provisional government.   The resolution emerged from an overnight session by theconference's nine-member Palestine committee that includes the PLO,Cuba, Senegal, India, Yugoslavia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Algeria andBangladesh.   The four-page resolution, made available to The Associated Pressin English by the source, said the movement would support anyaction by the PLO ``in pursuance and exercise of the inalienableright of the Palestinian people to independence and sovereignty inPalestine.''   The declaration is expected to further boost the PLO's effort totransform the international sympathy the uprising has gathered intopolitical gains.   The draft resolution also expressed concern over the situationin Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon.   Yasser Arafat's loyalists were driven out of camps in Beirutrecently after fierce fighting. They have regrouped in other campsin south Lebanon.   Syria, which seeks to control the Palestinian movement, and itsproxies have sought to crush Arafat's comeback in Lebanon, where hehad tried to rebuild the power base he lost in Israeli's 1982invasion.   The non-aligned resolution urged the United Nations to ``assumefull responsibility for the safety and the provision of safeguardsfor the security of the Palestinians inside refugee camps (inLebanon) and in the Palestinian territory under occupation.''</TEXT></DOC>
