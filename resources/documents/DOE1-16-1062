Cations, which do not possess alternatingvalency in aqueous solutions (Mg/sup 2+/, La/sup 3+/, Th/sup 4+/), decreasePHI rather slowly, increasing the rate of UO/sub 2//sup +/ oxidationby hydroxyl-radical. Anion-oxidizers (S/sub 2/O/sub 8//sup 2-/) decreasegreatly the exchange quantum yield. Unlike cation-reducers of UO/sub2//sup 2+/ anions, which are able to reduce it (Cl/sup -/, Br/sup -/),decrease PHI. Antibate dependence between efficiency of the anions foruranyl luminescence extinction and their ability to inhibit oxygen exchangeis observed. The latter permits to consider UO/sub 2//sup 2+/ interactionwith them as more or less reversible process of electron transfer resultingin the excitation loss. UO/sub 2//sup 2+/ reduction and UO/sub 2//sup+/ oxidation rate constants are evaluated.</TEXT></DOC>
