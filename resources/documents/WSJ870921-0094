Denison said workers are expected to return to their jobs today.    United Steelworkers union members struck Denison Sept. 2, a day after the previous contract expired. Denison, a mining and oil-and-gas concern, said the new pact includes annual wage increases -- tied to the rate of inflation -- of about 3.1% in the first and second year, and about 3.5% in the third year.    Denison said that would raise the hourly wage rate for its highest-paid miners to about 19.93 Canadian dollars ($15.15) by the third year of the new pact from 18.10 dollars under the previous agreement.    Meanwhile, about 1,800 strikers at Rio Algom Ltd.'s Elliot Lake uranium-mining operations were scheduled to vote late yesterday on a proposed three-year contract. Terms of the pact weren't available. The workers, also members of the Steelworkers union, struck Rio Algom, a mining and specialty-steel concern, Sept. 2. </TEXT></DOC>
