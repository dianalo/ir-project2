Gen. Barry McCaffrey leansagainst the hood of a jeep as the long, dark boat at the pierbehind him disgorges a long procession of military vehicles.   A cloud of diesel exhaust obscures the moon as the M-1tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles and all manner of trucksrumble down a metal ramp, turn right and head toward astaging area for the long drive into the desert.</LP><TEXT>   The general is watching the beginning of the second stageof the military buildup here: the arrival of sea-liftedmateriel from the U.S. An entire army division -- the 24thInfantry Division (Mechanized) from Fort Stewart, Ga. -- hasbeen assembled, loaded on 10 ships and sent halfway aroundthe world in less than a month.   Despite the arrival of the first batch of heavy tanks, theNavy's sea-lift operation has had its share of snafus. Armycommanders, for example, have complained that some shipshaven't been waiting at ports to receive weapons and othermaterial headed for the Middle East. Other vessels have beendelayed by longer-than-anticipated repair work to get themready for the voyage to Saudi Arabia, and at least one shiphas been beset by major mechanical problems along the way.   Under rules imposed on the press, the size of units ortheir locations can't be disclosed, but an Army divisioncontains between 15,000 and 20,000 men. &quot;Suffice it to say wehave already tripled the amount of armor in the country withour first two ships,&quot; the general says.   The landing of the 24th, whose 32-knot sea-lift ships madethe voyage through the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, the Suez,the Red Sea and the steamlike fog of the Persian Gulf in 16days, isn't an isolated logistics triumph. It is thebeginning of a procession of hulking gray supply ships neededto give the largely airlifted U.S. forces here bulk andstaying power.   Lying on the concrete jetty behind the general, rows oftired soldiers wait in the humid night for their vehicles toemerge from the USNS Regulus. Some of their stories involvehardship and sacrifice.   Lt. David Gray, 26 years old, had a whirlwind, three-monthcourtship of Stephanie Rouquie of Savannah, Ga. Starting witha blind date, they were married Aug. 6. The alert call cameat 2 a.m. the following morning. He had one hour to get tothe base. &quot;We weren't quite asleep yet,&quot; he recalls.   Cpl. Kenneth Simon, 25, and his wife had just settled intoa new apartment in Hinesville, Ga. They had been married forone year, but for most of that year, Cpl. Simon had been inSouth Korea. Their furniture had just arrived when the callcame. Because Cpl. Simon was an M-1 tank driver, he wasneeded to fill a vacancy in a departing unit. He wasn'talone, he says. &quot;When this happened they just startedgrabbing people from everywhere. A lot of the folks here weresupposed to go to Germany.&quot;   Every military story has someone like Michael Cook, 20, ofColumbia, Tenn. A fuzzy-cheeked private, he had just finishedfive months of basic training when he was told he was goingto Saudi Arabia. &quot;Myself, I didn't believe it. I thought I'dget some more training.&quot;   A few soldiers didn't make the trip. One of them was amedic who diagnosed himself insane and threatened suicide.This was a problem for Chief Warrant Officer Randy Jackson,37, who heads the medic's unit. &quot;He cracked up and we put himout of the Army. Better we find out there than over here.&quot;   The 24th is a far cry from the assemblage of NationalGuard units and draftees the U.S. landed on the North Africancoast in 1942 -- the nation's only previous experience withdesert warfare. They were untrained, poorly equipped andunprepared to handle the Desert Fox, Germany's Field MarshallErwin Rommel.   Gen. McCaffrey says he juggled emergency shipments fromnine ammunition factories to get the best for his men, whohave the latest high-technology weaponry.   Until now, U.S. battle plans have relied largely on thetank-killing capabilities of helicopters to blunt Iraqiforces, should they move across the border. According to Maj.Dan Grigson, public affairs officer for the 101st AirborneDivision, the helicopter and airborne units would then &quot;passthe battle&quot; over to the more heavily armed Marine unitsbehind them.   With the addition of the much heavier 24th, the U.S. wouldbe able to fight a new kind of desert warfare. Its armoredunits are trained to fight a moving battle at night, usingcommunications and targeting systems that give each soldieran average of 10 times the firepower of soldiers in the1970s-style Iraqi army, according to Gen. McCaffrey.   As for the human element, no story would be completewithout the Old Veteran. The soldiers were visited during theweekend by two congressional delegations, including veteransfrom World War II, Korea and Vietnam.   Among them was Rep. Dante Fascell (D., Fla.), one of thoseNational Guardsmen mobilized to fight Rommel's Afrika Corpsin 1942. Rep. Fascell, 73, still has vivid memories ofdriving a truck through smoking battlefields and seeingBedouins removing jewelry from the dead.   Dining with the soldiers here on freeze-dried fieldrations, he recalled evenings when the troops dined on camelmeat, which Rep. Fascell, chairman of the House ForeignAffairs Committee, says he doesn't recommend.   While there were some defeats, he said, the Americans andthe British finally drove Rommel from the desert. &quot;Frankly,the American soldier can adapt to almost anything,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
