Of particular concern from a human health and environmentalpoint of view are those products of incomplete combution known as polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). The objectives of this project were to identifythe quantities and chemical structures of hydrocarbons emitted duringthe industrial combustion of biomass and biomass/oil mixtures, to estimatethe health hazard (if any) associated with these hydrocarbon emissions,and to correlate these emissions with burner operating conditions. Thefirst objective has been met. Stack gas samples were taken, under a varietyof burner operating conditions, at three different facilities in NewBrunswick. Samples were analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry,identifying and quantifying a series of PAH and saturated hydrocarbons.The last objective has proven difficult. While the most obvious correlation,i.e. increased emission with low excess air is demonstrable by chemicalanalysis, the influence of minor changes in operating conditions includingfuel type and moisture appear to be largely outweighed by natural variationsin each system. Consequently, no specific guidelines for operation canbe defined other than that optimizing combustion conditions via excessair, turbulent combustion and burner design will minimize hydrocarbonemissions. The combustion of biomass produces hydrocarbon emissions whichare qualitatively very similar to those produced by combustion of fossilfuels. The quantitative impact of industrial biomass combustion on airquality is unlikely to be important in comparison to emissions from residentialheating systems. 33 refs., 21 figs., 30 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
