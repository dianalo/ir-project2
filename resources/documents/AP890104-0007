Our populatedareas must above all be safe,'' Erwin Horn, a federal lawmaker withthe opposition Social Democrats, said Tuesday.   NATO pilots resumed tactical flights over West Germany on Tuesdayfollowing a three-week moratorium in memory of the victims of a Dec.8 crash of a U.S. military jet on the northern city of Remscheid.Five West Germans and the U.S. pilot were killed.   Critics insist on more than a moratorium and say they will stepup their pressure for NATO forces in West Germany to abandonlow-level training flights, in which planes fly at altitudes as lowas 250 feet.   ``We want military low-level flights to stop permanently,'' saidWerner Mey, head of the nationwide protest group, ``Coordination ofOpponents of Low-Level Flights.''   ``There will be a whole spectrum of (protest) actions thisyear,'' Mey said in a telephone interview from his home inBiebelnheim near Mainz.   The screeching of NATO jets on low-flying training maneuvers is afrequent occurrence in West Germany, where air bases are scatteredacross the country. There are about 400,000 foreign NATO troops inWest Germany, more than half of them Americans.   A series of military air crashes in 1988 has ignited widespreadopposition among the West German populace to NATO low-level trainingflights.   Politicians from the Social Democratic Party are among the mostvocal opponents of the flights, at times scolding the United Statesand other NATO partners with warplanes here over the issue.   ``I appeal to the Allies to stop their low-level flights _ and tocarry out these flights at home,'' said legislator Albrecht Mueller,a Social Democrat.   He said West Germany's NATO partners should not expect ``Germancitizens to bear burdens that their own people are spared from.''   The debate over whether to stop NATO low-level training flightshas been a divisive one.   Polls indicate that nearly three-quarters of all West Germanswant the flights to stop.   In fact, observers note it can be politically dangerous tosupport low-level training flights.   ``Whoever says `Let's reduce low-level flights' is certain ofmeeting with approval,'' the respected daily Frankfurter AllgemeineZeitung said in an editorial on Tuesday.   Government officials, under public pressure, say they wantlow-level flights reduced to a ``minimum.'' But they insist theexercises are necessary for the proper training of NATO pilotsstationed in this country to offset possible threats from the Eastbloc.   Defense Minister Rupert Scholz has been targeted for harshcriticism during the dispute.   ``Perhaps a defense minister is needed with more experience andmore talent in balancing out military needs with citizens who aretormented by ... military flights,'' the Munich newspaper Merkursaid in a commentary.   The dispute over low-level jet training exercises is the centralissue of a larger debate _ often targeting the prominent U.S.military presence _ over whether West Germans are truly masters oftheir own land.   The left-leaning Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper on Tuesdaypublished a story about what it called ``round-the-clock noiseterror'' from U.S. helicopter units based near Frankfurt.   It said ``protests against the helicopter base at Bonames (nearFrankfurt) have never been as loud as they are now.''   ``The U.S. Armed Forces have not appeared especially ready tocooperate'' in reducing the noise at the base, the newspaper wrote.   The U.S. government insists its military forces do nothing tolimit West German sovereignty or to go against the wishes of theWest German government.   But many leftists have charged that conservative West Germanofficials wouldn't dare to thwart the will of U.S. militaryofficials.   Horn, in a list of demands on the defense minister, said Tuesdaythat ``German jurisprudence and German law should be put to use inorder to work against the loss of sovereignty through non-use.''   The opposition party plans to begin a parliamentary initiativethis month to examine whether West Germany's sovereignty rights arein jeopardy, and if so what can be done about it.</TEXT></DOC>
