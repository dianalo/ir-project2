Retarding and accelerating effects of CP on crack growthrates at different growth level are shown. The total effects of CP oncrack growth life under different conditions are determined by integratingcrack growth data from constant load amplitude tests, applying a linearload spectrum in the integration. When only small defects (1 mm) andlong life (andgt;20 years) are assumed, CP increases the life up to one orderof magnitude. On the other hand, under the most unfavourable conditionsof CP from sacrificial anodes and high growth rates, crack growth lifemay be slightly reduced compared with the life under free corrosion conditions.11 drawings.</TEXT></DOC>
