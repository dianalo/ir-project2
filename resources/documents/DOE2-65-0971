Modern acceptance of the importanceand use of cryogenic fluids continues to grow. By far, the bulk of cryogenicproducts are utilized by industry for metal making, agriculture, medicine,food processing and as efficient storage of fuels. Cryogenics has foundmany uses in the scientific community as well, enabling the developmentof ultra low noise amplifiers, fast cold electronics, cryopumped ultrahigh vacuums, the production of intense magnetic fields and low losspower transmission through the sue of cryogenically cooled superconductors.High energy physic research has been and continues to use cryogenic hardwareto produce liquids used as detector targets and to produce refrigerationnecessary to cool superconducting magnets to design temperature for particleaccelerator applications. In fact, today's super accelerators achieveenergies that would be impossible to reach with conventional copper magnets,demonstrating that cryogenics has become an indispensable ingredientin today's scientific endeavors.</TEXT></DOC>
