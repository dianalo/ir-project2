About 700 radical students battled riot police around DonggukUniversity when they were blocked from marching to the downtown U.S.Embassy by hundreds of riot police in green combat fatigues andvisored helmets.   ``Yankees go home'' and ``Down with military dictatorship,''students armed with steel pipes and clubs screamed as they hurledshowers of firebombs and rocks at lines of police blocking thestreet.   No serious injuries or arrests were reported during the 45-minuteclash.   Bush, in Seoul for a five-hour visit on his way home from Chinaand Japan, moved around the capital by helicopter and was nowherenear the violence. The government had mobilized 20,000 riot policein central Seoul to block protests during his visit.   Radical students protesting Bush's visit clashed with police inat least five provincial cities, including the southern city ofKwangju, where about 3,000 police engaged hundreds of students instreet battles.   Riot police drove off students who tried to protest outside theU.S. Air Force base at Kunsan south of Seoul, and clashes were alsoreported in Taegu, Pusan and Chongju.   Outside Dungguk University, riot police fired tear-gas bombs withrifles into groups of students or pelted them at close range withtear-gas grenades.   Several officers were set on fire after being hit by firebombs,but the flames were quickly extinguished.   Students burned effigies of Bush and President Roh Tae-woo at arally on the school grounds before marching out toward the U.S.Embassy about three miles away. Marchers beating drums led theprocession.   During the rally, radical leaders denounced Bush and the UnitedStates, charging that Washington keeps troops in South Korea toenforce its rule.   Earlier in the day, riot police broke up an attempt by dissidentleaders to march to the U.S. Embassy to deliver a letter addressedto Bush demanding withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops based inSouth Korea under a mutual defense treaty.   About 15 prominent dissidents shouting slogans and carryingpictures of Bush with red crosses drawn through them were seized andhauled away after trying to assemble about a block from the embassy.   ``No Bush visit,'' the small band shouted before they wereoverwhelmed by charging police, who kicked and punched some of theprotesters.   Dissident groups claimed 32 people were arrested today protestingthe visit. Police said there had been arrests, but gave no figures.   Bush's helicopter passed overhead minutes after a protest on itsway to the nearby presidential mansion, the Blue House, where Bushmet Roh.   Hundreds of riot police ringed the embassy and other U.S.facilites because of radicals' threats to hold nationwideanti-American protests.   Riot police were also posted at U.S. army bases to preventattacks.   The letter to Bush, released earlier by the nation's maindissident alliance, denounced the United States as the main sourceof division and strife in South Korea. It called for withdrawal ofall U.S. forces from South Korea and charged that Washington rulesthe country like a colony.   ``U.S.A. is the source of all suppression and sorrow to Koreanpeople since the division of the Korean peninsula,'' the letter said.   The letter accused Washington of dividing the Korean peninsulaand keeping troops in the South to prevent reunification withcommunist North Korea.   It also denounced Washington for seeking greater access for U.S.imports to South Korea.   The letter also said the Bush visit helps Roh, who they want tooust. Radicals claim Roh's government is a military dictatorshipcontrolled by the United States.   Radical students have little public support because of theirviolence and extremism, but can assemble thousands of activists andoften clash with riot police in Seoul and other cities.</TEXT></DOC>
