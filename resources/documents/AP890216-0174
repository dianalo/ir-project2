His declaration put him at odds with his wife, Barbara, who toldThe Associated Press Feb. 3 she is afraid of guns and ``absolutely''believes that assault-style weapons should be outlawed.   Spurning pleas for tougher controls, Bush said, ``No, I'm notabout to do that. And I think the answer is the criminal _ do morewith the criminal.''   Bush, a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, thenation's chief gun lobby, said states ``have a lot of laws on thesethings. Let them enforce them. It's hard, very hard to do, butthat's my position and I'm not going to change it.''   Bush made his comments in an Oval Office interview with eightreporters.   He drew a distinction between automatic weapons, which firecontinuously by holding the trigger down, and semiautomatic weapons,which fire each time the trigger is pulled without cocking.   Talking about semiautomatics, Bush said, ``If you're suggestingthat every pistol that can do that (fire each time the trigger ispulled) or every rifle should be banned, I would strongly opposethat.   ``I would strongly go after the criminals who use these guns,''he said. ``But I'm not about to suggest that a semi-automatedhunting rifle be banned. Absolutely not.''   The president said he learned just earlier in the day that fullyautomatic weapons are banned from import into the United States.   Bush said he was concerned ``enormously'' by the rash ofhomicides in the District of Columbia. Thirteen people were killedor wounded by gunfire in the city on Tuesday, making Valentine's Daythe bloodiest day in Washington in memory.   ``When you let a guy out of jail to commit a crime like this _it's outrageous. Two of these people were people that already had,have ... Help,'' Bush said, turning to his staff for information.   It was not clear which cases Bush was talking about, although agunman who killed three coworkers in suburban Chevy Chase, Md.,before killing himself had been a patient in a mental hospital fortwo years before being released in 1986.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said theadministration did not have any plans now for tighter gun controls.   Dozens of states, as well as Congress, are considering measuresto outlaw the manufacture, sale or possession of a variety ofsemiautomatic weapons.   Los Angeles police chief Daryl F. Gates, an adviser to Bushduring the presidential campaign on drug abuse and crime, hasendorsed legislation to limit the sale and import of assault weapons.   The Los Angeles City Council has banned the sale of semiautomaticweapons but has delayed its order for a week in connection with asuit filed by Colt Industries Inc. challenging the law.   Before the interview, Bush's position on guns was outlined duringa White House briefing, even as the district's homicide toll reached75, following a record 372 homicides in 1988.   ``Everyone in the country, including the president, is outragedby the homicides whether it be in Washington, D.C., or California oranywhere else,'' Fitzwater said.   ``There are any number of appropriate solutions to this kind ofproblems, the most obvious is for stepped up law enforcement but Iknow that everyone shares those concerns,'' the press spokesman said.   ``It does pose a major challenge to the law enforcement communityin this country and there are a lot of ways you can come at that butwe don't have any comment on specific episodes,'' Fitzwater added.   It was a Chinese AK-47 assault rifle that a gunman used in arampage last month in Stockton, Calif., in which five children werekilled and 29 others were wounded.   ``The issue of assault weapons and AK-47s and so forth is animportant one that has emerged in these recent episodes and one thatprobably needs to be looked at, in fact is being looked at by anynumber of state authorities as well as public interest groups whoare involved in this,'' the White House spokesman said.   Fitzwater said Bush ``has concerns about these items. We'resimply saying that we don't have any proposals for changing guncontrol laws at this point. But on the other hand it is worthwhilefor a consideration of these new weapons and what do they mean forsociety and should there be any changes.''</TEXT></DOC>
