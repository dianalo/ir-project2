LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Britain faces a difficult year in 1990 withcontinued high inflation and a slowdown in economic growth to 1.25percent, Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major said Wednesday.   Last year's economic growth rate of 4.4 percent will be cut bymore than half to 2 percent this year, he said.   But the economy must slow down to bring surging inflation``decisively down, and keep it down,'' Major said in his firstautumn statement to Parliament outlining the government's publicspending plans.   The new treasury chief made it clear that he has littleintention of easing tight monetary or fiscal policy, leaving theprospect of continued high interest and mortgage rates and tightcontrol on government spending.   But Major announced expenditures above the expected rate ofinflation in some key, and politically sensitive, areas: theNational Health Service, public transportation, higher educationand the homeless.   Major's statement, three weeks after he replaced Nigel Lawson astreasury chief, caused little stir on financial markets and waswelcomed by industry chiefs. ``It was a realistic prognosis of hardtimes,'' said Bill Martin, chief British economist at UBS-Phillipsand Drew Ltd.   But John Smith, the opposition Labor Party's treasury spokesman,told the House of Commons that the government's ``economicmiracle'' had been revealed as a ``hollow sham.''   The British government considers inflation its top economicproblem and has raised base lending rates from a low of 7.5 percentlast year to their current 15 percent level in an effort to chokeinflationary pressures.   The annual rate of inflation rose to a peak of 8.3 percent inJune and currently stands at 7.6 percent, among the highest ofWestern industrialized nations.   ``I expect it to remain high for some months'' before falling to5.75 percent in the last quarter of 1990, Major said.   Inflation is running at a far higher level than Lawson forecastin the March budget, when Britain's revenue-raising plans wereunveiled. Lawson had predicted a 5.5 percent rate in the fourthquarter of this year dipping to 4.5 percent by the second quarterof next year.   ``Our main priority must be to bring inflation decisively down,and keep it down,'' Major said. ``To achieve this, the economy mustslow down for a while. This does mean that 1990 may not be an easyyear. But the economy enters the 1990s in incomparably better shapethan it entered the 1980s.''   The chancellor forecast a steep rise this year in the country'scurrent account deficit, which includes invisible trade such asoverseas investment earnings as well as merchandise trade.   The deficit will soar to 20 billion pounds, or $31.6 billion, in1989 from last year's 14.6 billion pounds, or $23 billion. This wasa 38 percent increase over Lawson's March forecast of a deficit of14.5 billion pounds, or $22.9 billion, this year.   Major projected a 1990 deficit of 15 billion pounds, or $24billion, as the economy braked and the demand for imports shrank.   Lawson had said that a widening current account deficit thisyear shouldn't be of significant concern, maintaining it was due toheavy investment in British industry and was not chiefly the resultof consumer spending.   Major, however, linked the shortfall to unanticipated growth inconsumer spending. But he said that he anticipated improvement in1990 due to growth of already strong exports and a reduction indomestic demand.   ``As domestic demand slows, import growth should moderate,''Major said. ``At the same time, the strong rise in exports, whichhas been one of the most welcome developments in 1989, is forecastto continue.''   Britain will enjoy a budget surplus of 12.5 billion pounds, or$19.8 billion, in the current fiscal year ending March 31, butMajor said it will be lower than Lawson's forecast because of lessincome than expected from the privatization of nationalizedindustries.</TEXT></DOC>
