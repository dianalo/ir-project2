These streams were analyzed for heavy metals, organics,dioxins, and furans, as well as NOx, and inorganic acids. Leaching testswere performed on the ash. The results indicated that the PCB was reducedfrom 5 to 100 ppm to less than 1 ppm in the ash, which was the purposeof the removal action. Although research had indicated that the leadcompounds in the ash would become insoluble because they would be complexedwith carbon, the ash could not be considered non-leachable based on theEP toxicity tests.</TEXT></DOC>
