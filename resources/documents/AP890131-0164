Echoing his testimony last week before the Senate FinanceCommittee, Brady said the Bush administration would prefer Congress``wait a little'' to see if the trend of leveraged buyouts, whichapproached $100 billion in 1988, begins to diminish on its own.   ``We have a habit of correcting things just as they are about tocorrect themselves,'' Brady said. ``If we wait a little longer, thisthing is not going to gobble us up. We can't prove at this pointthat the economy has been damaged.''   Congressional Democrats, however, made it clear they're underpressure to rein in junk-bond-financed corporate takeovers,particularly because insurance companies and other holders oflong-term, investment-grade bonds are beginning to be hurt in thedeals.   For example, owners of some $5 billion in long-term bonds inRJR-Nabisco Co., saw the value of those securities drop by a $1billion to $4 billion almost overnight upon the announcement of itspending takeover by buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.last fall for $25 billion.   ``I have a feeling that we're looking at a Richter scale that'sshowing zero and then we have an eruption of 7 or 8 on the scale andit's too late,'' said Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., using a majorearthquake with widespread, heavy damage as a metaphor.   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the panel's chairman, said theoutcry for congressional action has become deafening in the 16months since then-Treasury Secretary and now Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III tried to blame the 1987 stock market crash on anattempt then to curb leveraged buyouts through tax law changes.   Brady agreed that the ``driving force'' behind the buyoutphenomenon is that companies can avoid a 34 percent corporate incometax rate by raising their capital through debt rather than stocksales.   He said the Treasury Department also has been attempting to finda way through Internal Revenue Service regulations or a legislativeproposal to make the tax treatment of stock-equity and bond-debtfinancing more equal, saying the buyout problem would disappear witha ``level playing field.''   ``So far we haven't been able to come up with one,'' he said,adding that the financial community's response to his appeals forsuggestions has been ``disappointing.''   Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, likened Brady's qualified endorsementof reducing the tax deductibility of interest on junk bonds inexchange for a corporate tax credit on dividends to ``a kiss througha veil'' and criticized him for not coming up with specificsuggestions.</TEXT></DOC>
