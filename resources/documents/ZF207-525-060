ScheierandM;Even as computer-security experts were lecturing in Washington, Robert Morriswas being indicted in connection with the &quot;worm&quot; attack that shut down theARPAnet computer network last year.andM;The indictment stirred some interest, but most speakers said viruses are anoverrated threat and can even serve a good purpose by getting seniormanagement more interested in computer security.andM;Donn Parker, a senior management systems consultant at SRI International, aMenlo Park, Calif., research and consulting firm, called viruses the latest&quot;crime-oid&quot; -- computer security threats that do comparatively little damagebut get a lot of publicity.andM;Here are Parker's picks for future &quot;crime-oids.&quot; Each is an opportunity tomake the case for security and to tell upper management, &quot;I've already got itcovered.&quot;andM;PC Theft: Parker said one insurance company lost more than $1 million in ATsfrom its storefront offices, even though some were bolted to desktop locks.andO;Thieves cut the tops off the desks and hauled the PCs away &quot;in less thanthree minutes,&quot; Parker reported.andM;The real threat isn't the loss of the PC, but of the data.andP;  The victim &quot;losta lot of insurance business&quot; while restoring lost files, he said.andP;  Thefts oflaptops with sensitive data on trials or mergers and acquisitions are obviousthreats.andM;Possible solutions: better locks on doors and on computers, removable harddisks that can be stored in safes and automated alarm systems in which PCselectronically check each other through the night.andP;  If one PC is kidnapped,another then dials the police with a digitized voice or faxed call for help.andM;EDI Fraud: As companies exchange checks, invoices and other documentselectronically, there's money to be made in changing or redirecting thedocuments.andM;Among the unanswered questions, said Parker, are when an electronictransaction becomes legally binding, and who is responsible for the loss ifan electronic transaction is sabotaged.andM;Parker's tip: Get the company's lawyers involved before plunging intoelectronic data interchange (EDI).andP;  Often, the necessary safeguards must benegotiated on a case-by-case basis.andM;Fax Graffiti: The same hackers who love to break into corporate computerdatabases may be writing code to emulate facsimile boards in PCs, Parkersaid.andP;  With nothing more than an Amiga computer, a modem and a list of faxnumbers, he said, hackers could flood corporate faxes with pornography.andM;One possible answer: &quot;smart&quot; faxes with PC front ends, so recipients canpreview their faxes before printing them.andM;----------It sounded strange coming at a computer-security conference, but severalspeakers warned that overheard conversations and sloppy handling of paper arebigger threats than hackers and tapped phone lines.andM;Written copies of files thrown in the trash can be so valuable, said Parker,that &quot;dumpster diving&quot; has become a popular pastime for hackers.andP;  Parkersuggested, only half jokingly, that printers feed paper right into shreddersso copies are destroyed unless the operator physically reroutes them.andM;William Murray, a fellow in information security at the Big Eight accountingfirm of Ernst andamp; Whinney in Cleveland, said that there's little reason to tapphone lines when envelopes can still be steamed open.andM;&quot;Copper wire is still harder to open than a plain white envelope,&quot; he said.andM;----------Forget passwords.andP;  Forget sign-ons.andP;  Forget fingerprints and scans of theblood vessels inside your eye.andP;  Here's a hot idea to confirm the identitiesof computer users, as described by Federal Bureau of Investigation AssistantDirector William Bayse.andM;According to Bayse, an algorithm could be developed to measure &quot;keyboarddynamics&quot; -- that is, how hard a user hits certain keys, how often they type&quot;s&quot; instead of &quot;a.&quot; The only way to defeat such a system, Bayse told theconference, &quot;would be to hold a gun to somebody's head and hope their handsdon't shake so much they screw up the algorithm.&quot;andM;----------Computer security has its own, sometimes arcane, language.andP;  Consider, forexample, &quot;spoofing.&quot;andM;&quot;Spoofing&quot; means writing a program that mimics the regular sign-on screen tothe network or mainframe.andP;  When a user enters his or her correct log-on andpassword, the program records that information on a disk for later retrieval.andM;The spoofing program, meanwhile, tells the user his password was incorrectand dumps him back into the regular sign-on screen.andM;This time, of course, the user's log-on and password work, and he startswork, blissfully unaware that security has been compromised.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
