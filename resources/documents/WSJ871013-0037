Closely held Imperial offered to pay Holly stockholders $68 a share and one share of the combined company for each of Holly's 1.1 million shares outstanding. Under the terms of the proposal, Holly shareholders would own 23% of the new company and a new employee stock ownership plan, which would purchase the combined company's stock for about $29 a share, would own another 23%. Imperial didn't put a total value on its offer.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Holly closed at $86.50, up 87.5 cents.    Imperial's bid follows close on the heels of a proposal from Plum Associates, an investment group led by Peter Harvey, president of Artra Group Inc., Northfield, Ill. Plum Associates last week offered $91 a share for 667,000 Holly shares, which when combined with the stock it already owns would give it two-thirds of the shares outstanding.    In addition, Plum said it would swap the remaining shares for special preferred stock with an estimated value of $91 a share.    A managing director for L.F. Rothschild andamp; Co., investment adviser for Plum Associates, said the board of Colorado Springs, Colo.-based Holly met yesterday afternoon to weigh the two proposals. Holly officials couldn't be reached to confirm the meeting.    Franklin Chu, the Rothschild managing director, said Plum agreed to extend its offer through yesterday to allow Holly directors the time to respond. The offer was set to expire yesterday morning.    Imperial, whose offer is scheduled to expire tomorrow at noon EDT, said it has a commitment from a New York bank to provide $75 million to finance the cash part of its purchase and an additional $75 million credit line for working capital. Plum also has indicated it has lined up commitments to finance its acquisition of Holly.    Holly, one of the nation's largest processors of sugar beets, has been trying to go private since January 1982, but previous efforts repeatedly have failed to get the necessary financing.    The latest bidding comes two months after the collapse of an attempt by then-chairman Michael Buchsbaum to take the company private in a leveraged buy-out. Holly had accepted Mr. Buchsbaum's $134 million bid, ending a flurry of offers and counteroffers from Mr. Buchsbaum and investment groups Burbank, Calif.-based Shamrock Holdings and Brookehill Equities Inc., New York.    But Holly's board dissolved the agreement when it concluded that Mr. Buchsbaum couldn't provide financing for the purchase and after a series of delays Mr. Buchsbaum said were caused by death threats against him and his family. Mr. Buchsbaum then resigned as Holly chairman.    Imperial Chairman I.H. Kempner III said his company, which refines sugar from cane, was approached by Holly's independent directors after the collapse of Mr. Buchsbaum's bid. Imperial then hired investment bankers Shearson Lehman Brothers to advise it on the acquisition.    Mr. Kempner said that combining the two companies would allow them to function better in the heavily regulated and subsidized sugar business. &quot;We would be more balanced in our exposure to federal regulation,&quot; if the two businesses were combined, he said.    For the year ended March 31, Holly earned $4.9 million, or $4.38 a share, on sales of $317.1 million. Imperial said its sales for 1986 were between $240 million and $250 million; it didn't provide earnings figures. </TEXT></DOC>
