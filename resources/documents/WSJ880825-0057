The civil-rights groups charged that the county's two million Hispanic residents are unfairly represented on the county's board. No Hispanic has ever been elected to the body in its 138-year history, despite accounting for 28% of the county's population in the 1980 Census, the complaint alleged.    The suit asks the federal court to enjoin the county from continuing its &quot;discriminatory practices&quot; and order new elections to be held in redrawn district boundaries. Spokesmen for the county board and its legal counsel couldn't immediately be reached for comment.    Last month, Maldef and others won a separate voting-rights case in Watsonville, Calif., that ordered the city to adopt district elections. Watsonville, almost 50% Hispanic, hadn't elected a Hispanic official in nearly 15 years. </TEXT></DOC>
