In this paper,we present the approach concerning the licensing rules applicable toN8. The following aspects are covered: rules applicable to the NSSS;rules applicable to the BOP (codes of design for systems and structures);rules applicable to the equipment (code of construction for mechanicaland electrical components); impact on the lay-out of the plant. Someexamples of application of this methodology are given.</TEXT></DOC>
