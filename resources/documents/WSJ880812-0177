As a Bogota-based journalist, surely Mr. Nares knows there's a lot more to the Colombia story than drug traffickers and left-wing guerrillas.    The Colombian government itself acknowledges that nearly 140 death squads and paramilitary units are currently active throughout the country. These groups, often operating with the support or acquiescence of the Colombian military, are responsible for thousands of political killings and &quot;disappearances&quot; in recent years, according to Amnesty International. In 1983, Colombia's attorney general named 59 active-duty military officers who he said had ties to MAS, the most notorious Colombian death squad. In 1986, his successor deplored &quot;a rising wave of official violence&quot; that was sweeping the country.    No analysis of Colombia's current crisis can be complete without acknowledging the assault on the country's institutions, and thousands of non-combatant citizens, by those who are duty bound to protect them.
