While the color hyperfine interaction is knownto be successful in describing the mass splittings, inclusion of pionexchanges markedly improve the mass predictions of nucleon resonances,particularly those of negative parity. Fitting to all well establishednon-strange baryon masses below {approx_equal} 2 GeV/c/sup 2/ significantlyimproves previous results.</TEXT></DOC>
