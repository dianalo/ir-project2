(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   San Quentin Prison, for more than acentury one of the toughest places in the nation to do time, hasbeen emptied of virtually all its most hardened criminals.   Some 1,750 of them, more than half the population of the137-year-old fortress that once held Charles Manson and SirhanSirhan, have been sent to new prisons throughout California as partof a $5 billion prison expansion.   In their place are minimum- and medium-security prisoners,including many who live in trailers outside the prison walls on SanQuentin's fenced-in grounds and have little contact with thehigher-risk inmates inside.   California's Death Row remains here for the 252 prisoners, allmen, facing execution by cyanide gas. But aside from them, ``wehave lost almost all of our hard-core (inmates),'' said prisonspokesman Cal White, not unhappily.   ``That once housed the most desperate people in California,'' hesaid, pointing to an empty five-tier cellblock. ``Now, it's just atemporary holding facility.''   The concrete-and-steel compound ringed by guard towers on theedge of San Francisco Bay has long been depicted as one ofAmerica's toughest prisons.   Its inmates included Sirhan, who assassinated Robert F. Kennedyin 1968, and Caryl Chessman, convicted of Los Angeles' ``red lightbandit'' sex attacks of 1948. He became a best-selling authorbehind bars before being executed in 1960.   But in the past two years, most of the highest-risk prisonershave been sent to three new prisons. Manson, the leader of amurderous cult and perhaps the most notorious prisoner inCalifornia, went to the new Corcoran prison near Fresno.   Corcoran is one of eight prisons opened in California since1980. The state's prison population has tripled since then to morethan 75,000, more than any other state. None of the older prisonshas been affected more than San Quentin.   On the outside, the complex appears as forbidding as ever.Several buildings were erected in the middle to late 19th century _one has the date 1857 chiseled in its front _ and even the morerecent structures are decades old.   On the inside, what authorities call San Quentin's ``change inmission'' is quickly apparent. In addition to holding medium- andminimum-security inmates, it serves as a reception center, wherenew inmates are sent for orientation and classification.   ``The stress level here has dropped considerably over the pastcouple of years,'' White said. ``We used to have some kind ofincident every day. It wasn't uncommon to have a `lockup' everymonth. Now that's pretty much of a rarity.''   The prison has been extensively remodeled, including a $28million overhaul of an old cellblock. In the hospital, 55 years oldbut newly refurbished, is the dental ward, a spic-and-span suitethat smells powerfully of disinfectant.   ``They call me `Dr. Painless,''' said Dr. Glenn Jamieson, abouyant, breezy man who has taken care of prisoners' teeth here for22 years. He calls the ward ``the only air-conditioned place in theprison ... as good as any on the outside.''   Despite the changes, a visitor never forgets that San Quentin issteeped in violence.   Before visitors go through the massive steel gates, a guardwarns of the possibility of being taken hostage and adds that statepolicy ``is to never negotiate a prisoner's freedom for the releaseof hostages.''   The officer adds with a grin, ``Welcome to San Quentin!''</TEXT></DOC>
