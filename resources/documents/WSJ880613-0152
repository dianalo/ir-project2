MD-11 trijet and to offer its engines on AIRBUS INDUSTRIE'S commercial jets for the first time.    Under the accord signed with McDonnell Douglas, the RB-211-524L engine will be available from spring 1993.    The memorandum of understanding with Airbus means that the European consortium will be able to fit the Rolls-Royce engine on its A-330 jet beginning in mid-1994. The twin-engined A-330 is scheduled to begin service in 1993; customers will choose between the Rolls-Royce engine and one from CFM International, a partnership of General Electric Co. of the U.S. and France's state-owned Societe Nationale d'Etude andamp; de Construction de Moteurs d'Aviation, or Snecma.    Rolls-Royce announced last Thursday that it will proceed with development of the RB-211-524L, a high-power version of the RB-211 engine. The program will cost an estimated #300 million ($546 million). Rolls-Royce plans to ask the British government for an unspecified amount of funding; since 1979, Rolls-Royce has received #437 million in aid from the government to launch its engine programs. </TEXT></DOC>
