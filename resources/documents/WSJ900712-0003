Now it may be the Democrats' turn to chew some lead.   The question is Social Security, an issue that over theyears has been as politically potent for the Democrats asno-new-taxes was for the GOP. Now, with the president willingto put taxes on the table, Democratic budget negotiators mayhave little choice but to risk the wrath of the elderly andagree to pare back benefits.</LP><TEXT>   The numbers make a compelling case. Social Securityaccounts for $1 of every $5 the U.S. government spends, andit's hard to see how the participants in the budget summitcan meet their goal of an honest $50 billion reduction in thefederal deficit without making some savings in the program.   At the moment, two benefit-reduction ideas are beingfloated. One is the direct approach: a reduction incost-of-living adjustments. The other is indirect: increasingthe income tax on Social Security benefits.   Either way, many Democrats remain terrified at theprospect. &quot;It's just one of those political givens that it'sscary&quot; to touch Social Security, says Robert Strauss, aformer Democratic National Committee chairman. Both withinand outside the budget summit, though, it's widely believedthat Congress and the public will back a deficit-reductionplan only if everyone sacrifices -- including the elderly.   Some observers already detect subtle changes in how theonce-sacrosanct program is being viewed today. &quot;Go back andlook how the media portrayal of the elderly has changed,&quot;says Fay Cook, a Northwestern University professor of socialpolicy. &quot;Articles talk about how active they are, howwell-to-do.&quot; For years, economists have been pointing outthat children may be more deserving of government aid thanolder people -- and some members of Congress are listening.After all, nearly 20% of all children live in poverty,compared with 12% of the aged.   Even some older people's lobbyists sound conciliatory --up to a point. &quot;We are explicitly saying that old people needto be part of the solution. We don't need to be exempted,&quot;says John Rother, director of public policy for the AmericanAssociation of Retired Persons. But he adds that the &quot;specialcharacter&quot; of the Social Security trust fund must be&quot;respected.&quot; That's a polite way of saying: Keep your mittsoff Social Security.   The only obvious alternative is to charge the elderly morefor Medicare, the federal health-care program. But budgetnegotiators are talking about getting at least $3 billionfrom benefit programs for the elderly in the first year-inaddition to whatever savings the government gets by squeezingdoctors and hospitals -- and as much as $50 billion over fiveyears. Congressional analysts say it would be tough to getthat much money from Medicare beneficiaries in the first yearwithout very sharp increases in the $383 annual premium and$75 annual deductible for doctors' services.   When the budget summit turns to Social Security, cuttingcost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, is appealing because itsaves so much money, and because a COLA freeze can spread thepain of deficit-reduction across a wide array of programs. Athree-month delay in making the adjustments for allgovernment benefits except those exclusively for the poorwould cut the deficit by more than $3 billion next year. Itwould cost the average retiree about $85 next year.   One rub is that trimming COLAs hurts those who depend onSocial Security checks for survival as well as those whodon't need the money. Although programs aimed exclusively athelping the elderly poor could be increased to cushion theblow, congressional analysts say that wouldn't protect allthe low-income elderly. Two-thirds of all Social Securitybenefits paid to the elderly go to those well above thepoverty line. But Census Bureau surveys show that SocialSecurity is the only source of income for millions of poorelderly Americans.   The bigger problem with cutting COLAs is political. Nosooner did House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D.,Calif.) put the idea on the table than Senate BudgetCommittee Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.) and Sen. PeteDomenici (R., N.M.) predicted it would die on the table. Theonly reason to even mention it is to make other money-savingproposals look more appealing, Sen. Domenici says.   Sen. Domenici and others were seared by a 1985 vote by theRepublican-controlled Senate to cut COLAs. The plan died whenPresident Reagan pulled the rug out from under them.Democrats turned the vote into a campaign issue, and someRepublicans say it cost them control of the Senate.   Already, the National Committee to Preserve SocialSecurity and Medicare has sent out mass mailings urging theelderly &quot;to stop a cut in your Social Security benefits whichwould cost the average retired couple $2,820 over fiveyears.&quot; (The estimate refers to a proposal to suspend COLAsfor one year.)   All this is nudging the summit toward an increase in thetax on Social Security benefits. Couples with incomes above$32,000 and individuals with incomes above $25,000 now paytax on 50% of their benefits. About one-fifth of all SocialSecurity recipients pay; the revenue goes back into theSocial Security trust fund. Subjecting 85% of the benefits totaxes would cost a well-off retired couple with annual incomeof $60,000, including $10,000 in Social Security benefits,about $1,000 a year in higher taxes.   The appeal of this approach is that it doesn't hurt thepoorest of the elderly. &quot;Obviously, the case for taxingbenefits is much stronger&quot; than for cutting COLAs, saysAARP's Mr. Rother. It also would raise lots of money. Rep.Panetta has offered a plan to tax 85% of the benefits paid tocouples with incomes of $18,000 and individuals with incomesof $12,000; it would bring in $3 billion next year.   It does have two political liabilities. Unlike a COLAfreeze that could be applied to civil service and militarypensions and, therefore, could be sold as an across-the-boardmoney saver, the tax change would single out Social Security.And the tax increase would hit the well-organizedmiddle-income and upper-income elderly who led the campaignfor repeal of Medicare's catastrophic-illness coverage. Butneither of these liabilities appears to frighten the summitnegotiators much.   Complicating the summit's discussions of Social Securityis Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D., N.Y.), who loudly points outthat the government is collecting billions more in SocialSecurity payroll taxes than it spends in benefits -- and isusing the money to make up the deficit in the rest of thegovernment.   &quot;Social Security didn't put us in the situation we're inwith the deficit,&quot; says Max Richtman, director ofgovernmental affairs for the National Committee to PreserveSocial Security. &quot;It's running at a huge surplus.&quot;   To deflect criticism, the budget summit is almost certainto redefine the deficit to exclude the Social Securitysurplus. Then trimming Social Security benefits wouldn't makethe deficit look any smaller. But, in fact, no matter howCongress decides to rewrite the accounting rules, allgovernment receipts go into one big pot. If the pot isinadequate, the Treasury borrows money. Cutting benefitswould still reduce the government's need for borrowed money,and that's the point of the budget summit.   So in the end, Congress would probably count SocialSecurity cuts, if it makes them, toward its deficit-reductiongoal even as it takes the program out of the deficitcalculation. &quot;Emerson said consistency is the hobgoblin ofsmall minds,&quot; says summit negotiator Rep. Bill Frenzel (R.,Minn.). &quot;We do not have small minds.&quot;   Confronted with the same issue, Rep. Panetta, pretendingto be a magician, opens the left side of his jacket and says,&quot;Goes in here . . . ,&quot; then opens the right side and says, &quot;.. . comes out here.&quot;   ---       Cutting Social Security to Shrink the Deficit                                 FISCAL 1991  FISCAL 1991-95                                 SAVINGS      SAVINGS                                                                                                          Delay annual COLAs* for   three months for all   benefit programs except   those for the poor .......... $3 billion   $17 billion                                                                                                          Eliminate all COLAs   for one year ................ $9 billion   $59 billion                                                                                                          Tax 85% of Social Security   benefits (instead of 50%)   paid to couples with incomes   above $32,000 and   individuals with incomes   above $25,000 ............... $1 billion   $20 billion                                                                                                          Increase Medicare premium   to cover 30% of costs ....... $0.3 billion $10 billion                                                                                                          Increase Medicare deductible   to $100 (from $75) and   adjust each year with   inflation ................... $0.4 billion $ 5 billion                                                                                                          *Cost-of-living adjustments   Source: Congressional Budget Office</TEXT></DOC>
