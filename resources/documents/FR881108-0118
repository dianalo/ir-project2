Geographicalinfluences that have helped determine the discovery and development ofthis country, and global conditions that have given rise to wave afterwave of immigration to our shores, make ours a history that cannot be understoodwithout a ready knowledge of world geography. In order for our Nation tomaintain its special heritage and retain its position of global economicand political leadership, it is essential that our citizens have a soundappreciation of basic geographical facts and principles. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Today, however, as recent studies_including a major report last summerfrom the National Geographic Society_have affirmed, many young people andadults lack knowledge of elementary geography. The situation among 18-to 24-year-olds is particularly disturbing, with these young Americansranking last in basic knowledge in this multination report.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">We can do better. A free society has no greater enemy than ignorance,and there is no greater waste than the underuse of a child's God-givenability to learn and explore. Fortunately, our Nation has begun to givenew attention in the past decade to the need for educational reform andeducational focus. Young people need to be challenged early and often;and subjects like geography, and closely related studies like history andcivics, can be taught in ways that promote curiosity and help young peoplestretch their minds and engage their imaginations as they view the mapand all the many frontiers and horizons it charts.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Truly we live in a world rich in wonder, variety, and mystery. DuringGeography Awareness Week, 1988, we can resolve to share more of these qualitieswith our children and to encourage them in their understanding of the social,economic, and political influence of geographic issues and conditions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Congress, by Public Law 100-391, has designated the period beginningNovember 13 and ending November 19, 1988, as ``Geography Awareness Week''and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamationto recognize this observance.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States ofAmerica, do hereby proclaim the week of November 13 through November 19,1988, as Geography Awareness Week.
