The protective layer in the outer reaches of the earth'satmosphere is 4 percent thinner than it was in 1986, according toDr. Mostafa Tolba, the executive director of the United NationsEnvironment Program.   Last year, scientists predicted this year's reduction would onlybe 2 percent, Tolba told reporters Tuesday. He is in the Hague fora two-week conference on the ozone layer problem.   The sun's ultraviolet rays reaching the earth's surfaceunfiltered by the ozone layer have been linked to a variety ofenvironmental and health problems ranging from stunted plant growthto skin cancer in humans.   It is also held partly responsible for the gradual heating ofthe earth's atmosphere known as the ``greenhouse effect.''   Damage to the ozone layer is mainly caused by a group ofman-made chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs, which arewidely used in aerosol cans, refrigerators, air conditioners andvarious types of plastic foam used for packaging and insulation.   The UNEP-organized gathering of scientists from more than 30nations is the first meeting of its kind since last year's signingof the Montreal Protocol, which calls for the production of CFCs tobe cut to half its 1986 levels by 1998.   However, Tolba said chlorofluorocarbons production shouldultimately be cut to 15 percent of those levels or even phased outcompletely if there is to be no further damage to the ozone layer.   Since the late 1970s, the ozone layer, which forms naturally butis gradually depleted by the emissions, has contained a large holeover the South Pole.   Tolba said the hole appeared slightly smaller this year than in1987, although he added it is normal for its size to fluctuate fromone year to the next. He said climatic factors, and not a lesseningof the CFC problem, were responsible.   The Netherlands and West Germany, both major CFC-producingnations, have already called for a complete ban on production ofthe dangerous chemicals.   Under the Montreal Protocol, a review of the ozone layersituation is scheduled to begin in 1990, but Tolba said thatprocess will be accelerated and begin next year.   Later this week, scientists at the conference will discuss theuse of harmless substitutes for CFCs. The conference ends Oct. 28.</TEXT></DOC>
