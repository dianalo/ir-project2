The restructuring marks Sealy's second attempt in the past18 months to lighten its debts. Sealy's operating resultshave consistently fallen short of projections, causing theCleveland-based mattresss company difficulty in handling itsdebt load. In April 1990, Sealy turned over about 40%ownership to its biggest lender, First Boston, in return fordebt reduction.</LP><TEXT>   Sealy Chairman Malcolm Candlish said in an interview thatthe company should be able to operate &quot;comfortably&quot; withreduced debts. Mr. Candlish said &quot;all parties involvedrecognized that we needed to be in a better financialstructure than we are now.&quot;   Sealy achieved financial notoriety in 1989, winning thenickname &quot;Burning Bed&quot; on Wall Street because of its debttroubles. But an investment banker who worked closely on thenew restructuring plan declared yesterday: &quot;The fire has beenput out.&quot;   Under the new plan, Sealy would shrink its total debt to$490 million from $890 million currently. The restructuringswould be made in Sealy's $510 million of subordinated loansfrom First Boston; the company's $380 million of bank debtwouldn't be affected.   If the new plan takes effect, Sealy said its interestexpense would shrink 50%, to about $56 million a year. Sealyadded that its current owners, directors and First Bostonhave approved the plan.   First Boston currently owns $260 million of 15.5%subordinated notes and $250 million of 14% seniorsubordinated notes. Sealy said First Boston has agreed toconvert the 15.5% notes into stock in closely held Sealy, andto swap the 14% notes for Sealy stock and $110 million of new13% notes.   The proposed restructuring would significantly dilute a30% stake in Sealy currently held by the buy-out firm ofGibbons Goodwin van Amerongen andamp; Co. In early 1989, GibbonsGoodwin had acquired Sealy for $980 million, borrowing muchof the purchase price from First Boston in the form of abridge loan.   At the time of the buy-out, Gibbons Goodwin executivesprojected that Sealy could expand sales 14% or more a year,and grow its operating profit even faster. Those projectionsquickly proved too optimistic, dashing First Boston's hopesof selling junk bonds to outside investors and paying off thebridge loan. Gibbons Goodwin's original majority stake inSealy already was cut back significantly in last year'srestructuring.   As the new dominant owner of Sealy, First Boston isexpected to take control of the company's board. First Bostoncurrently has four of 10 board seats; the composition of thecompany's new board is still being negotiated.   People familiar with First Boston's plans say that theWall Street firm doesn't expect to own Sealy long-term. It'slikely that First Boston will handle its Sealy investmentmuch like a venture capital or buy-out equity investment, tobe held for four or five years and then sold at a profit.   Last December, First Boston took a sizable loss reserveagainst the value of its loans to Sealy and other highlyleveraged companies. Yesterday, First Boston indicated thatthe 1990 reserve will be adequate to cover the latest Sealyrestructuring; it doesn't expect to take any big newreserves.   With the debt reduction, Sealy's Mr. Candlish says, thecompany's closely held stock &quot;certainly has more value thanit had before.&quot; Although Gibbons Goodwin and some otherinvestors are being shrunk to a 6.4% stake in the company,these investors will get warrants that could boost theirstake to 21.6% if Sealy's fortunes improve.   For the six months ended May 31, Sealy posted a net lossof $29 million on sales of $285 million. The company's cashflow -- or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation andamortization -- declined 14%, to $39 million.</TEXT></DOC>
