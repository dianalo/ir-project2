(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A woman separated from her husband hassued the state, saying she shouldn't be forced to have a judgedetermine the father of her 2{-year-old daughter before she canchoose the girl's last name.   At stake in the lawsuit filed Thursday in U.S. District Court iswhether Betty Virella, who hasn't seen her husband in more thanseven years, can name her daughter Jacqueline after the girl'sfather, James Aponte.   Virella, 30, of Providence said the state Health Department hasrefused to issue a birth certificate unless she agrees to use thesurname of her estranged husband, Victor Andino.   ``I don't have a birth certificate for my daughter and she's 2{years old now,'' Virella said. ``It's like Jacqueline is not inthis world.''   Mary Ellen McCabe, the Health Department's chief legal counsel,said the department seeks to protect the rights of the legalfather, who may not be the same as the biological father.   Under Rhode Island law, a woman's husband is the legal father,and her child must have the husband's surname unless there is acourt ruling that another man was the father, said McCabe, whowould not comment directly on Virella's case.   Jean Rosiello, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney whorepresents Virella, said Virella had not sought a court order onpaternity and should not be forced to do so.   ``Our point is that whether she can afford the expense of goingto Family Court, she has the right to choose the name of herchild,'' Rosiello said.   Virella, who uses her maiden name, said she had to producerecords showing she had been pregnant, had given birth and that thechild was still alive to enroll Jacqueline in Aid to Families withDependent Children.   An expert on vital statistics said policies dictating a child'ssurname are becoming rare.   ``There are not that many states that do it anymore,'' said MaryAnne Freedman, director of health statistics in Vermont and pastpresident of the Association for Vital Records and HealthStatistics.   ``Over the course of the past 20 years, parents have been namingtheir childen with surnames that bear no relation to either thefather's or mother's names,'' she said.   In a 1986 letter to Women andamp; Infants Hospital, where Jacquelinewas born, the Health Department said that if a mother is married atconception or birth, ``the parents may give the child any name theywish as long as both parents sign the worksheet.''   Virella said she was worried her estranged husband could somedayclaim custody if the child bore his name.   The choice of a surname ``is a legal matter which has a lot ofbearing on the rights of the child,'' said George Gay, chief ofregistration methods at the National Center for Health Statistics.   In most states, a court order on paternity would be the easiestway to clear up the situation, he said.   Virella said she left Andino 12 years ago when she moved to NewYork City from Puerto Rico. She said she last saw Andino, who stilllives in Puerto Rico, more than seven years ago.   She said her other daughter, Jennifer, 4, was born in New YorkCity and was allowed to have Aponte's surname.</TEXT></DOC>
