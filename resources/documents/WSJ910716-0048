The long-awaited decision will affect congressionalreapportionment in four states and the distribution of anestimated $59 billion in federal assistance.</LP><TEXT>   In choosing not to adjust the 1990 count, Mr. Mosbacheroverruled Census Bureau Director Barbara Bryant and seven outof nine members on the bureau's undercount steeringcommittee. They had urged that the figures be adjusted on thebasis of a post-census survey that estimated a nationwideundercount of 2%, or roughly five million people. A separate,outside panel considering the issue split, 4-4, over whetherto recommend an adjustment.   Although he conceded there was an undercount, Mr.Mosbacher said at a news conference that changing the censuscount would &quot;abandon a 200-year tradition&quot; of counting peoplein the U.S. and should be done only if &quot;it would make thecensus better.&quot; He said he found the evidence in favor of anadjustment &quot;inconclusive and unconvincing&quot; and was concernedthat an adjusted census would be less accurate at the locallevel.   Ms. Bryant said that she had recommended an adjustment tocorrect the Census Bureau's &quot;historic problem&quot; in countingminorities, especially blacks, Hispanics and NativeAmericans. Yesterday, Mr. Mosbacher said the 1990 censusundercounted blacks 4.8%, Hispanics 5.2%, and AmericanIndians 5%.   The accuracy of the 1990 census has been in dispute sincebefore it was taken. Under a 1989 court-ordered consentjudgment in a lawsuit brought by New York City, Philadelphia,and several other cities, the Commerce Department wasrequired to consider the merits of adjusting the census basedon the post-enumeration survey, in which census employeeswere sent to a fraction of U.S. households to check theaccuracy of the count. Following a court-ordered timetablethat many Commerce Department and Census Bureau officialscontend didn't allow time for sufficient statisticalanalysis, Commerce Secretary Mosbacher had to announce hisdecision by July 15.   Cities have long suffered from unusually high undercountsbecause they shelter large numbers of blacks, Hispanics andother disproportionately low-income minority groups that aredifficult to count accurately.   In a statement, New York City Mayor David Dinkinsdenounced Mr. Mosbacher's decision as &quot;deplorable&quot; and saidit was &quot;driven more by politics than by sound public policyconsiderations.&quot; Rep. Tom Sawyer (D., Ohio), who heads theHouse census and population subcommittee, said the decision&quot;has the consequence of a gerrymander on a national scale.&quot;   Mr. Mosbacher denied that political considerations were afactor and said he hadn't discussed the matter with the WhiteHouse. But he confirmed that an aide to White House counselC. Boyden Gray had contacted members of the outside panelabout their recommendations, and described the aide's actionsas &quot;out of line.&quot; The incident was reported in yesterday'sNew York Times.   An administration official said that the aide, RobertSwanson, had been instructed to investigate the legalramifications of a possible decision to adjust the censusfigures. A White House spokeswoman said that Mr. Swansonwasn't authorized to contact members of the panel.   There is broad agreement that adjusting the census basedon the post-enumeration survey would be more accurate at thenational level. But many demographers are concerned that anadjustment would be less accurate at the local level andwould hurt the federal grant process and reapportionment.   At yesterday's news conference, Mr. Mosbacher saidadjusted census figures would be more accurate for 29 statesand less accurate for 21 states. But he also contended thatthe unadjusted census would be more accurate for 11 of the 23metropolitan areas with 500,000 or more people, including NewYork, Chicago and Washington, D.C.   Adjusting the 1990 census would appear to favor Democratsover Republicans, because the big cities suffering thelargest undercounts tend to be heavily Democratic. Butadjusting the 1990 census would likely result in one morecongressional seat for Arizona, which is predominantlyRepublican, and one less for Wisconsin, which ispredominantly Democratic. Also, adjustment would give oneadditional congressional seat to California and one less seatto Pennsylvania.   The relationship between population counts and federalgrant money isn't clear-cut either. Roughly $59 billion infederal aid is allocated partly on the basis of population,according to Michael Murray, professor of economics at BatesCollege in Lewiston, Maine, who examined the issue for theCensus Bureau. But population isn't the only consideration.Some Community Development Block Grants, for example, awardmore money to cities that have smaller population growth, onthe theory that they suffer from an eroding tax base and,therefore, are more needy.</TEXT></DOC>
