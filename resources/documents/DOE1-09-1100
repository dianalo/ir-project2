In the presence of ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid (EDTA) about 99% of the neodymium in a 200-ml sample solution (pH2.2 to 2.5) was concentrated in 0.50 g Muromac 50W-X12 cation exchangerwithin 15 min. EDTA does not interfere with the sorption of neodymiumions on the resin but suppresses spectrophotometric interference by ferricions and ion-exchange saturation by ferric and thorium cations. The resin-phaseattenuations at 740.5 nm and of the resin background at 620 nm were usedfor measurements with a 5-mm cell. Neodymium in the range 0.1-10 mg couldbe simply and rapidly determined without interference from other rareearths and the proposed method was used to analyse the rare-earth mineralsand alloys.</TEXT></DOC>
