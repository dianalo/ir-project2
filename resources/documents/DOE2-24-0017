Accordingly, preventive maintenance technology is beingused for operating and maintaining electric power equipment as a meansfor achieving high-quality electric energy. Extensive effort is beingmade for developing such technology. Supervision technology which hasbeen developed satisfactorily is as follows: Preventive maintenance equipmentdeveloped for rotary machines includes rotor health checkers, non-destructivediagnosis equipment for bearings, rubbing diagnosis equipment, vibrationmonitors, unbalance monitors, equipment for forecasting materials deteriorationand residual life, and equipment for monitoring operation at site. Theheart of the technology embodied in such equipment is vibration analysis.Also, technology for diagnosing substation equipment abnormality is beingdeveloped. It is intended for substation equipment, such as transformersand switch protective devices. It includes equipment for automatic analysisof gas in oil, portable equipment for monitoring charge/discharge intransformers, monitors for partial discharge, instruments for measuringbreaker characteristics, equipment for locating GIS accidents, and monitorsfor leak current in arresters.
