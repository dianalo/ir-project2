The poaching violations come at a time when duck populations arealready hurt by an eight-year drought in their breeding grounds.   ``Duck numbers already are near record lows because of thedrought and continued destruction of their natural habitat,'' saidFrank Dunkle, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. ``Theycannot long withstand additional losses from illegal harvest.''   More than 100 wildlife service agents spent three years in anundercover investigation of 41 commercial waterfowl huntingbusinesses on the Texas coast, documenting more than 1,300violations in one of the agency's biggest operations, officials said.   ``During this investigation, service agents reported flagrantviolations of laws intended to protect waterfowl,'' Dunkle saidTuesday. ``Law-abiding waterfowlers are outraged by these unethicaland unsporting practices that betray total lack of concern for thestatus of waterfowl populations.''   Agents from around the country went undercover to book hunts withguides and owners of hunting businesses charging $65 to $500 a daywho were suspected of killing waterfowl illegally and encouragingand helping customers to do likewise. Alleged violations occurred on92 percent of the hunts, the service said.   The agency said 23 hunting guides and owners were being arrested,22 of them in Texas and one in Iowa. Indictments or chargescontained in a federal document named 50 others, and 137 people wereto receive misdemeanor notices of violation in Texas, Alabama,Georgia, Maryland, Michigan and Oklahoma.   Charges include shooting more than the legal limit; ``rallying,''or stirring up waterfowl to drive them toward hunters; use of leadshot in steel shot zones; failure to retrieve shot fowl _ wantonwaste; use of electronic calls; taking birds after the season hasclosed or outside legal hunting hours; and tagging andrecord-keeping violations, such as claiming birds belonged tosomeone who had not hunted that day, or falsifying when birds wereshot.   In several cases, the service said raptors, herons, ibises andother non-game migratory birds were allegedly killed and sold toundercover agents.   Agents documented one case in which a dozen hunters in blindsaround a pond shot as many geese as they could, killing more than200 birds _ 139 over their limit.   Wildlife service spokeswoman Megan Durham said the agents wentundercover because the violations were occurring ``behind lockedgates and in remote areas and it's difficult to get information anyother way.''   Maximum penalties for the misdemeanors could be six months to oneyear in prison, and fines of $5,000 to $100,000 for individuals and$10,000 to $200,000 for organizations, depending on the charge.   Maximum penalties for felony violations could be two to fiveyears in prison and fines of $250,000 for individuals and $500,000for organizations, depending on the charge.</TEXT></DOC>
