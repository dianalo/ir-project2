Christian HillStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)CONGRESS (CNG)EXECUTIVE (EXE)TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE) </IN><TEXT>   The U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the thrift industry's powerful trade group, plans to lobby for a short-term recapitalization of the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp., and if unsuccessful is likely to support a merger of the FSLIC into the larger Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., industry sources said.    The moves are likely to at least complicate the insolvent FSLIC's rescue by Congress, and could result in a political stalemate. The U.S. League isn't considered strong enough to get the industry's position adopted by Congress, but it may be strong enough to delay or derail a longer-term Reagan administration plan to recapitalize the FSLIC that it considers too costly to the industry. Congressional hearings on ways to recapitalize the FSLIC are scheduled for tomorrow and Thursday.    Industry sources said the U.S. League's board agreed Friday to seek congressional support for a recapitalization plan that would initially be limited to about $5 billion to $6 billion of borrowings for two years. Together with FSLIC assessments of the insured thrifts and interest income, the borrowings would provide a total of roughly $4.5 billion to $5 billion in each of those years.    The Reagan administration's plan would provide $15 billion of borrowings to the FSLIC over an expected five-year period. Industry officials assert that under the plan, the insured thrifts could wind up paying, through the assessments, annual interest of $1.5 billion on the debt for 20 years or more.    Many savings and loans bitterly oppose the proposal, saying it is an open-ended blank check on their net worth. They argue that regulators and Congress are mainly to blame for the speculative frenzy that destroyed many thrifts and the FSLIC's solvency in the past three years. Some of the best-capitalized thrifts are threatening to bolt the FSLIC by converting to savings banks under FDIC insurance, further weakening the FSLIC.    &quot;There is a great and growing dissatisfaction with the notion that the industry should have to pay for the sins of its brothers,&quot; says Donald Shackelford, chairman of State Savings of Columbus, Ohio.    The industry sources said the board, in the event that no compromise is reached on recapitalization, would quickly throw U.S. League support behind a merger of the two insurance funds. Such a merger has, until very recently, been anathema to the U.S. League, which has vigorously argued that the FSLIC is needed to support the thrift industry and its role as the nation's main housing lender.    U.S. League officials weren't available for comment yesterday, a national banking holiday. But one thrift executive who participated in the board's discussions said, &quot;If the two-year plan gets blown out, there will be a tremendous move to consider merger of the funds.&quot;    Supporting a merger of the funds is still likely to be a controversial idea among the U.S. League's members. The thrift executive acknowledged that such support &quot;would be extraordinary, but what we're dealing with here is the worst of evils.&quot; The FSLIC's reserves have dwindled to about $2 billion, and it has delayed closing or liquidating many thrifts that would cost it many times its reserves. The FDIC has more than $18 billion of reserves, and its future expenses in dealing with commercial-bank failures are believed to be manageable, even though it will probably have a negative cash flow for the next two or three years.    &quot;The wiser thing may be to merge the funds and attempt to preserve the Federal Home Loan Bank system for consumer-related lending,&quot; says the president of a big Florida thrift. Thrifts can borrow from Federal Home Loan banks at an advantageous rate, while commercial banks can't.    The FSLIC insures the savings of depositors in savings and loan associations up to $100,000 for each account. The FDIC similarly insures deposits in commercial banks and some savings banks. The thrift industry's current troubles began in the early 1980s, when the interest rates paid on savings exceeded the rates thrifts charged on loans. Many thrifts tried to recoup by investing in risky real estate ventures, and eventually faced big losses which the FSLIC had to cover through its insurance.    Last year, the U.S. League had been consistently reluctant to back a long-term FSLIC recapitalization. But its members recently began to actively oppose the Treasury Department plan because the outlook for the FSLIC's future losses became more bleak, and many thrifts began to doubt the federal regulators' ability to crack down on speculators who are still operating within the thrift industry. As a result, they fear they could pay billions of dollars to support a recapitalization that doesn't solve the problem.    &quot;There are still institutions operating out there that are going to cause enormous losses,&quot; said the chairman of a giant West Coast thrift. Richard Pratt, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, added: &quot;Sandamp;L's should worry that they will be locked into a long-term recapitalization, only to find out later that the FSLIC still needs to be merged into the FDIC.&quot;    A long-term plan would create unacceptable costs, thrift executives say. &quot;The interest costs are astronomical over 20 years,&quot; said the West Coast executive. Another executive said that the FSLIC would be unable to phase out its special assessment on the industry, amounting to $1 billion a year, if it borrowed $15 billion. Recapitalization proposals made last year provided for a phase-out of the assessment over several years.    Some industry officials say a political compromise is still the most likely outcome, and that threats to support a merger of the funds or leave the FSLIC are mostly &quot;rhetoric.&quot; But many agree that an exodus to the FDIC will be attempted by healthy thrifts if the Treasury Department gets its way completely.    &quot;I'm operating on the assumption that something sensible is going to happen,&quot; said the chairman of the West Coast thrift. &quot;If it doesn't, you'll see us all at the FDIC door.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
