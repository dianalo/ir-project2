(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Cornell University graduate student whosefather is a top government computer-security expert is suspected ofcreating the ``virus'' that slowed thousands of computersnationwide, school officials said Saturday.   Robert T. Morris Jr., 23, a first-year student in a doctoratecomputer science program, has a reputation as an expert computerhacker and is skilled enough to have written the rogue program,Cornell instructor Dexter Kozen said.   The New York Times quoted sources as saying Morris created thevirus, which on Wednesday night began infecting an estimated 6,000university and military computers connected through the Arpanetcomputer network established by the Pentagon.   The virus slowed down computers by replicating itself over andover and taking up memory space, but it is not believed to havedestroyed any data.   The origin of such programs is hard to investigate, and it may beimpossible to trace the virus back to Morris, said M. Stuart Lynn,vice president of information technologies at Cornell.   ``At this stage we're simply not in a position to determine ifthe allegations are true,'' Lynn said at a news conference. He saidhe did not know how long the investigation would take.   ``It's quite conceivable we may not be able to say with anycertainty'' if the virus was created in Cornell's computer system,he said.   He said the university had been contacted by the FBI, but therewas no indication any criminal charges would be filed. Officialssaid the school could discipline Morris if he was involved.   The FBI said it was launching a preliminary inquiry to determinewhether federal law had been violated.   Morris could not be reached for comment Saturday. His roommate,Chansong Da, said Morris did not come home Friday and she did notknow where he was. University officials also were unable to contacthim, Lynn said.   Reached at his home Saturday in Arnold, Md., Robert T. MorrisSr., chief scientist at the National Computer Security Center inBethesda, Md., would not say where his son was.   Morris told The Washington Post his son is ``simply unavailable... and will remain unavailable until he has time to retain alawyer.''   Morris Sr. said he met with FBI agents for about an hour Saturdayto explain why his son will not immediately comply with theirrequest. He said the family has had preliminary discussions with anattorney and expects to hire one by Monday.   Morris said he is in regular contact with his son and that theyhave discussed the allegations.   ``I certainly will not report anything of our conversations,'' hesaid. ``I am simply not in a position to deny or confirm theallegations. I have no direct knowledge.''   A federal law enforcement official confirmed Saturday that theFBI is attempting to determine what role Morris' son may have playedin creating the virus. The inquiry is ``rapidly developing rightnow,'' the official said.   The elder Morris has written widely on the security of the Unixoperating system, the target of his son's virus program, the Timesreported. He is widely known for writing a program to decipherpasswords, which give users access to computers.   Cornell officials said they began examining Morris' computerfiles Friday night after the Times identified him.   Morris had passwords in his files ``for some computers at Cornelland Stanford to which he is not entitled,'' although those couldhave been placed there by someone else, Lynn said.   A computer file dated Oct. 26 found in Cornell's system Saturdayis the earliest indication that Morris may have been writing theprogram that spawned the virus, Lynn said.   The Times reported in its Sunday editions that friends of Morris'said he quickly realized the virus program was out of hand and thathe arranged for a friend to send out instructions oh how toeradicate the virus.   The instructions, however, were posted on a so-called electronicbulletin board that few people would see, the newspaper said.   The purpose of the virus program was to spread a tiny programthroughout the country and the rest of the world and have itsecretly take up residence in computers' memories, the paper said.The program was to always ``hide'' in the background to escapedetection.   It probably wasn't a malicious act, said Dean Krafft, researchassociate in computer science at Cornell.   ``It would have been extremely simple to take this virusstructure one step further so that it was extremely destructive,''Krafft said. ``With a couple more lines (in the program) it couldhave wiped out files in all 6,000 computers.''   The computers affected by the virus all used the Unix 4.3operating system program, a modification of the Unix systemdeveloped by ATandamp;T that was produced by the University of Californiaat Berkeley. Unix operating systems are the most popular softwarefor workstation and medium sized computers.   If it was Morris, he ``apparently found a gaping hole in thesystem that I'm amazed no one exploited before,'' Kozen said. Whilethe loophole in the system was not evident before the virus wasunleashed, ``in retrospect it's really quite obvious.''   ``He is reputed to be a good hacker, and I guess this would bethe proof of it if it's found that he did cause (the virus),'' Kozensaid.   Bob Ford, a spokesman for Bell Laboratories, said the youngerMorris worked in the company's Computing Science Research Center atMurray Hill during the summers of 1983 and 1984 and that his jobincluded writing computer programs.   The Times quoted computer scientists as saying one of Morris'projects at ATandamp;T was rewriting security software for most computersthat run the Unix system.   The summers were before and after Morris' freshman year atHarvard University, where he received his undergraduate degree, Fordsaid. Morris lived in Millington, N.J. at the time.   ``From what I hear, he is extremely bright, obviously,'' Fordsaid. ``The code he worked on was intended for internal use only.The programs were not intended for use outside of Bell Labs.   Ford said the elder Morris worked at Bell Labs at Murray Hill andWhippany for 26 years before retiring in 1986.   Some computer centers were forced to disconnect from Arpanet andshut computers down, but by Friday most reported that the virus hadbeen eradicated.   However, at the University of Illinois, researchers decidedFriday evening to pull off Arpanet ``for the duration.''   ``This virus has too many skills and it's not worth the risk,''said Paul Pomes, a research programmer at the school. Experts therethought they had defeated the virus, only to find that the systemhad been reinfected.   Some researchers said the virus had several variations and thatit was making an effort to capture passwords and break the ``superuser'' code, which allows a user to work on a system with norestrictions at all.   Despite his reputation as a hacker, Morris was an average studentwho kept to himself, according to faculty and fellow students.   ``I haven't seen too much of him in my course,'' Kozen said.``He's said to be brilliant but that's directed to a certain areaand that area is not his classes. I get the feeling he doesn't wastetoo much time on homework, but put him at a keyboard and he's awhiz.''</TEXT></DOC>
