The controversy over Japan's proposed FSX warplane casts a shadowover last week's summit visit by Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita,the first foreign leader to be hosted at the White House sincePresident Bush took office.   Under the pending agreement, St. Louis-based General Dynamicswould join forces with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries toco-develop and co-produce a new-generation Japanese fighter, fordeployment in the late 1990s.   Proponents say the deal is the best that could be negotiated inview of Japanese refusal to buy wholly American-built planes, andthat it fosters beneficial technology transfer in both directionswith Japan while generating income and jobs for U.S. industry.   Critics, however, contend the agreement amounts to atechnological giveaway that will enable the Japanese to compete moreeffectively against this country in the global aviation market. Theyargue that Tokyo should purchase American-made fighters to helpoffset the $50 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan.   The FSX issue surfaced during a Capitol Hill meeting Fridaybetween Takeshita and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,D-Maine, Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and a group of othersenators involved with trade and foreign affairs.   During the closed-door meeting, questions over the proposed dealwere raised by Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., according to Japaneseofficials who briefed reporters after the session.   Danforth was among 12 senators who signed a letter to Bush urgingthat his administration conduct a complete review of the FSXagreement, which had been negotiated under the Reagan administration.   The letter, organized by Sens. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., and JesseHelms, R-N.C., said the deal posed complex issues including defenseburden-sharing and the ``long-term impact on the health andcompetitiveness of the American aerospace industry, the only hightechnology area in which the United States remains the undisputedworld leader.''   ``We are requesting that you order a complete review of the FSXprogram within the administration, including the departments ofCommerce, Labor and Energy, as well as the Office of the TradeRepresentative and the White House science office,'' the senatorstold Bush.   After the letter went to the White House, Secretary of StateJames A. Baker III said at a meeting Thursday with Japanese ForeignMinister Sousuke Uno that the administration was, in fact, reviewingthe jet fighter project and no decision on it had been made.   Japanese officials said Uno urged Baker to process a licensequickly and notify Congress of the technology export. The Japanesehave said they want to start the project before March 31, the end oftheir fiscal year.   A memorandum of understanding on the FSX was signed last Novemberby U.S. and Japanese officials. Once the administration finallycertifies the agreement, Congress would have 30 days in which itcould vote to disapprove the deal.   Fueling the controversy over the FSX was an article Jan. 29 inThe Washington Post by Clyde V. Prestowitz, a former CommerceDepartment official and outspoken advocate of a hard-line U.S.stance in negotiations with Japan.   Prestowitz said the deal would increase the U.S. burden ofdefending Japan ``by diverting scarce Japanese defense dollars ...from immediate procurement needs into a 10-year project.''   Also, he wrote, ``it will transfer technology developed at greatexpense to U.S. taxpayers at very low cost to a country whoseprimary interest is not defense but catching up with America inaircraft and other high-technology industries.''   Alvin A. Spivak, a spokesman for General Dynamics, responded thatunder the deal American industry _ including the No. 2 U.S. defensecontractor and other companies _ will receive 35 percent to 45percent of the $1.2 billion being spent on development of the FSX aswell as a comparable share of the $5 billion production program.   The agreement offers a chance ``to provide jobs for Americanworkers and to bring many hundreds of millions of dollars into theAmerican economy that otherwise would stay in Japan if they were todevelop their own fighter aircraft,'' he said.   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., called the FSX deala ``terrible mistake.'' He said he hoped Congress will be able to``discourage the administration from following this course before wehave a bitter fight about it.''   Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y., said bluntly about the deal:``It stinks. ... It's about time we had the courage to stand up andsay we're not going to take this any longer''   D'Amato said if the agreement goes through, ``what will takeplace is that 10 years from now, they (the Japanese) will build thesuperior airframes, they will have the superior technology thatwe've helped them obtain by turning over some of our technical baseas well in this deal.''   In the House, Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., said he was ``verydisturbed'' about the FSX technology transfer.   ``We can't prevent the Japanese from building their own domesticaerospace and defense industries,'' he said. ``But I see no reasonfor us to hand them the blueprints at a very modest price.''</TEXT></DOC>
