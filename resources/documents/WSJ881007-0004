A drought burns up crops in the Midwest. Searing summer temperatures raise concerns everywhere about the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; and the wisdom of burning more and more fossil fuels.    It's as if the gods have conspired this year to force presidential candidates George Bush and Michael Dukakis to address questions about natural-resource issues -- the environment, energy and agriculture. Those issues have been shirked or ignored in recent campaigns, but they've become hot topics in this presidential race.    As a result, the two candidates have been compelled to stake out unusually detailed positions. Mr. Bush has broken away from President Reagan on the contentious issue of acid rain, and he has promised a series of tax breaks for the oil industry. Mr. Dukakis has spoken out against offshore drilling in environmentally fragile areas and proposed putting natural gas on the front burner as an energy source.    The two argue about nuclear power and bicker over whether &quot;supply management&quot; or unfettered markets offer the best solution for drought-weary farmers. But more significant than such details is the simple fact that the attention focused on natural-resource issues now probably guarantees that the government will be more active in the area no matter who wins.    &quot;Because the public has demanded that more be done, as a result more will be done,&quot; says William Ruckelshaus, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who advises Vice President Bush.    Neither candidate seems to have a clear political advantage in the debate over natural resources. Mr. Bush, a former Texas oil man, has an affinity with oil and gas producers in the Southwest, but that area also has slumped badly during the Reagan administration. Mr. Dukakis and the Democrats have an advantage among environmentalists, who are scornful of the Reagan administration's environmental record, but Mr. Bush worked hard at setting his own new environmental agenda. And neither has been very specific on agricultural policies.    The biggest Bush-Dukakis scrap so far has been the candidates' coast-to-coast debate over who is more of an environmentalist. Mr. Bush and the Republicans promise a broad program to protect the air, sea and water. The vice president says he would set a &quot;clear timetable&quot; to cut millions of tons of sulfur-dioxide emissions by the year 2000 to clean up the air, and pledges to end ocean dumping by 1991 to stop beach pollution. He promises to expand the National Park System and convene a global conference on the environment to study the problem of the greenhouse effect, the process by which carbon dioxide traps heat on the Earth's surface and warms the global climate.    &quot;I am an environmentalist,&quot; Mr. Bush has declared. But his Achilles heel is the Reagan record on environmental issues. &quot;After eight years, there isn't much one can point to that the Reagan administration has done in the environmental area,&quot; says Lester Brown, president of Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research group.    Environmentalists blame Mr. Bush for not acting while EPA budgets were being cut in the early years of the administration, and they note that he headed a deregulation task force that led a drive to rescind EPA rules phasing lead out of gasoline. And they assert that he seems to be on both sides of questions about offshore drilling for oil, stressing his concerns about its effect on the environment when he's in conservation-minded California and portraying himself as a booster of drilling when in Texas and Louisiana.    Mr. Ruckelshaus says Mr. Bush is &quot;sympathetic to a balanced approach&quot; to the environment. And the Bush campaign has tried to counter charges about the Reagan record by pointing to filth in Mr. Dukakis's hometown Boston Harbor, which has remained polluted with waste water during two Dukakis terms as Massachusetts governor.    But Mr. Brown of Worldwatch says that Massachusetts has &quot;an exceptional environmental record&quot; in other areas, and notes that a group called Renew America has ranked Massachusetts as being tied with Wisconsin for the lead among the states on environmental protection.    Mr. Dukakis also has proposed a broad and detailed environmental agenda. He promises to establish national standards on sulfur-dioxide and nitrogen-oxide emissions to cut acid rain, and he says he would establish a cadre of &quot;certified public toxics auditors,&quot; who would act like certified public accountants in helping companies meet environmental laws.    Mr. Dukakis also promises to end below-cost timber sales in national forests. And he opposes offshore oil drilling in &quot;critical environmental areas and productive fishing grounds,&quot; such as Georges Bank in the Atlantic.    The two candidates have staked out equally clear positions on energy issues. Mr. Bush wants to encourage domestic oil exploration through a series of tax incentives for oil producers: a 10% tax credit for oil and gas exploration, elimination of the windfall-profits tax, expansion of the research and development tax credit to include enhanced recovery techniques and tax relief for intangible drilling costs. He wants to fully decontrol natural-gas prices and fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve faster, and he says nuclear power &quot;must be a part of our energy mix.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis's energy positions are similar in some ways. He too wants to stimulate domestic oil drilling through tax incentives, possibly through temporary abatement of federal income taxes on a portion of production from new wells. He also suggests filling the strategic oil reserve faster, possibly by offering a $5-a-barrel premium for oil from new fields.    Like Mr. Bush, Mr. Dukakis wants to step up the use of &quot;clean&quot; natural gas by eliminating legal and regulatory barriers that block big gas users from bargaining directly with producers. And he would &quot;augment&quot; spending on technologies to make burning coal cleaner.    But there are some clear differences between the two candidates as well. Mr. Dukakis flatly opposes construction of new nuclear-power reactors -- though that stand may be more symbolic than significant, because prospects for new nuclear plants are dim anyway.    Overall, some in the oil and energy industries contend, the Massachusetts governor wouldn't be aggressive enough in pursuing new energy sources. &quot;The tragic thing is Dukakis saying no to nuclear, no to offshore drilling, no this, no that,&quot; says Robert Odle, a former assistant energy secretary in the Reagan administration who now is a Washington lobbyist for energy interests. &quot;Where does the juice come from?&quot;    The campaign debate over agriculture has turned into a battle over vague approaches rather than specific programs. &quot;I don't think either one of them has a real strong, well-thought-out agricultural policy,&quot; says North Dakota Gov. George Sinner, a Democrat.    Mr. Bush touts &quot;market orientation,&quot; vowing to knock down trade barriers overseas and expand use of grain for alcohol-based fuels. He favors renewing the increasingly popular 1985 farm bill while pursuing the Reagan administration's objective of phasing out all income and price-support programs around the world. And he declares that he doesn't believe in production controls, asserting at a stop in rural Illinois last week: &quot;I don't think that is the answer to American agriculture.&quot;    Mr. Dukakis talks about &quot;supply management,&quot; which aides say generally means he favors a &quot;balance&quot; of traditional price supports and set-asides of farm land to keep farm prices at desirable levels. Such a balance, the Dukakis camp maintains, will keep farm prices high enough to let the government begin whittling down its multibillion-dollar subsidy program.    In the end, because the candidates' agriculture proposals aren't very specific, farmers may not base their vote on a strict economic calculation. &quot;I think they will vote on issues other than what farm prices are,&quot; says Randall Russell, a farm consultant. &quot;They will vote on who they think will be the most effective leader.&quot;    ---                  Strengths and Weaknesses:          The Candidates on Natural-Resource Issues    Dukakis's Proposals      -- Launch cadre of certified public toxics auditors.      -- Oppose new nuclear power plants.      -- Consider a $5-a-barrel premium on oil from new field         fields sent to Strategic Petroleum Reserve.      -- Use a balance of traditional price supports and land         set-asides to keep farm income up.    Dukakis's Vulnerabilities      -- Pollution in Boston Harbor.      -- Inexperience with farm issues.    Bush's Proposals      -- Cut &quot;millions of tons&quot; of sulphur-dioxide emissions         to curb acid rain.      -- Expand the National Park System.      -- Give oil producers a variety of tax credits to         expand oil drilling.      -- Stress expanding production and opening new markets         to keep farm income up.    Bush's Vulnerabilities      -- The Reagan administration environmental record.      -- Fears his free-market approach to farm issues         wouldn't protect family farmers.</TEXT></DOC>
