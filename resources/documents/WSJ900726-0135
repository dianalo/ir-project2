Equimark charged the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. morethan $10 million for its nine-month management of NationalBancshares Corp. of Texas.</LP><TEXT>   Among the alleged expenses is a charge of about $1,400,apparently for transporting from Pittsburgh to Texas a 1962black Rolls-Royce owned by Equimark Chairman Alan S.Fellheimer.   FDIC Chairman William Seidman said that until the agencyreviews Equimark's records, he isn't sure how much Equimarkwill be asked to reimburse. &quot;But it may run into themillions,&quot; he said. &quot;There are a lot of questions about thekinds of things that were charged when then were running{National Bancshares} on our behalf.&quot;   Mr. Fellheimer vigorously denied that Equimark charged thegovernment with any improper expenses, and he said hepersonally paid for transporting his Rolls-Royce. The billwas less than $1,000, he said.   &quot;We're prepared to back with documentation every nickel wecharged them,&quot; Mr. Fellheimer said.   The FDIC, however, said Equimark incurred &quot;questionableexpenses&quot; for lodging, travel and a data processing system itinstalled at National Bancshares. Alan J. Whitney, an FDICspokesman, said the agency sent Mr. Fellheimer a letter July17 requesting documentation for expenses incurred in SanAntonio, Texas.   Regulators first informed Mr. Fellheimer in April thatthey planned to request documentation about expenses, Mr.Whitney said.   Among other things, the inquiry seems to center on billsrun up by Equimark employees who shuttled between Pittsburghand San Antonio. Most stayed in hotels.   Mr. Fellheimer contended that he hadn't yet received theFDIC letter and said regulators make frequent requests forincreased documentation.   The inquiry is the latest problem in Equimark's failedattempt to acquire National Bancshares in a $116 millionfederally assisted buy-out. The acquisition was to be thecenterpiece of Mr. Fellheimer's driving ambition to expandthe bank beyond Pennsylvania.   The attempt proved costly. The deal collapsed in Aprilwhen National Bancshares' bondholders rejected the offer andregulators refused to allow Equimark to sweeten the deal.Consequently Equimark took a $3.7 million charge for employeeseverance packages and other items.   The FDIC request comes at a time when Mr. Fellheimer isunder increasing criticism from Equimark directors. In May,the board deliberated for six hours over whether he wouldkeep his job. While they voted to retain Mr. Fellheimer, hemust stem losses from bad real-estate and consumer loans andill-fated acquisitions in Idaho and Philadelphia.   In the second quarter Equimark had a loss of $29.8 millionbefore one-time gains from the sale of a credit-card unit. Inthe past 12 months, its share price has fallen more than 60%.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,Equimark shares closed at $5.125, unchanged.   Regulators aren't the only ones to raise eyebrows over the$10 million payment. At a U.S. bankruptcy court hearing inSan Antonio earlier this month, National Bancshares creditorsgasped when they learned the bank had paid that much money,and banking experts have said the amount seems extravagant.   National Bancshares executives have said the fees weredetermined in a contract between the FDIC and Equimark. WhileNational Bancshares technically paid Equimark, in effect itwas FDIC money because the Texas bank was insolvent.   While Equimark ran National Bancshares, it instituted anaggressive marketing campaign, set up a telephone loan lineand threw customer parties at bank branches and countryclubs.   ---   Paul Duke Jr. in Washington, D.C., contributed to thisarticle.</TEXT></DOC>
