The Saudi army's elite &quot;Peninsula Shield&quot; division, alongwith thousands of Egyptian and Moroccan troops, now guard themain desert and coastal approach routes from the desolateKuwaiti frontier. The first group of Syrian soldiers has beendeployed near a section of the border closer to the coast,and even the tiny Persian Gulf sheikdoms of Bahrain, Qatarand Oman are deploying troops at the urging of the U.S. andSaudi Arabia.</LP><TEXT>   But behind this tripwire of Arab soldiers about 20 milesfrom the Iraqi border, U.S. commanders are marshaling theirformidable forces for what is likely to be a different kindof battle in the next few days and perhaps weeks.   As part of a calculated, psychological test of wills withSaddam Hussein, American forces are trying to intimidate theIraqi military and its leadership, according to U.S. andSaudi officials. U.S. officers are jamming groundcommunications, challenging Iraqi fighter pilots in the airthrough long-range warnings, and sending out wide-rangingpatrols of Apache helicopters with laser-guided missiles.   Keeping heavily armed American units well back from theskirmish line along the border, according to these officials,is part of a broader strategy intended to destroy SaddamHussein's standing in the Arab world if he launches any kindof attack and injures Arabs in the multinational force. Theplan also ensures that U.S. forces retain maximum flexibilityto take defensive or offensive action.   Meanwhile, the long-awaited arrival of the ships carryingthe most deadly U.S. tanks, the Army's M-1 models, means theywill reach the field in the next few days. And the general incharge of supplying the rapidly expanding U.S. army here witheverything from weapons and fuel to candy and shaving creamtold reporters that his operation has mushroomed into&quot;probably the largest logistical exercise ever accomplishedin a short period of time since the end of World War II.&quot;   The buildup of heavy ground forces accelerated over theweekend as the first troops from the Army's 24th MechanizedInfantry Division based at Fort Stewart, Ga., stepped off achartered Pan Am jumbo jet. Their M-1 tanks and BradleyFighting Vehicles will substantially increase the heavy armorin Saudi Arabia and plug an important gap in the makeup ofU.S. forces here.   Providing the most detailed breakdown so far of the12,000-mile supply trail sustaining Operation Desert Shield,Maj. Gen. Gus Pagonis said the Saudi government has beengiving free fuel, water, food, buses, trucks and evenmilitary barracks to American troops. &quot;They will give usanything they have without any hesitation,&quot; he said.   Right on the border, the Saudis appear to have only rifleand pistol-toting border guards, backed up by a couple ofpickup trucks equipped with makeshift machine guns. Guards inflowing white robes and turbans listlessly lean againstrundown posts surrounded by garbage and abandoned vehicles. Agnarled man wore a shiny black bandoleer and waved a WorldWar I-era bolt-action Enfield rifle. Fourwheel-drive trucksslowly patrol sections where an ordinary chain link fencemarks the edge of a three-mile-wide no man's land betweenSaudi and Iraqi territory.   Not too far to the southwest, the multinational forces aredigging in to defend what would be a natural highway forIraqi tanks if fighting breaks out.   The first group of Western journalists to visit the Arabforce taking shape in the hard-packed, pancake-flat desertsaw a scene straight out of a Middle East adventure novel.Standing in a large tent with an Oriental carpet on theground and gold-colored cloth lining the inside, Col.Abdurahim Mohammed al Said, the commander of a battalion ofSaudi M-60 tanks, described the morale of his men. &quot;For them,it is a question of victory or martyrdom,&quot; he said.   Instead of a map, Col. Said used a box filled with sand toexplain why his battalion was blocking one end of a widevalley. A grid of black and green strings showed distancesand the route of the nearest highway. A deep gouge in thesurface represented the valley. Pink flags stuck in the sandmarked the location of Saudi units.   Brig. Gen. Mohammed A. Shehri, the chief supply officerfor the division, described the Saudi military's reaction toSaddam Hussein more bluntly. &quot;We are not going to give thiscrazy man a singe meter of (our) land. He will have to goover us.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
