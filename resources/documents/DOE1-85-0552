<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-85-0552 </DOCNO><TEXT>N-methylformamide (NMF), a polar solvent, is currently being evaluatedby the National Cancer Institute (NCI) as an antineoplastic agent becauseof its activity against colon, mammary, and lung tumor xenografts. Resultsfrom preclinical studies suggest that it has radiosensitizing, chemosensitizing,and differentiating activity. Its mechanism of action remains unknown,but may involve cellular depletion of glutathione, cell membrane changes,or modulation of proto-oncogene expression. Preclinical toxicology studiesconducted in mice, rats, and beagle dogs showed reversible hepatotoxicityto be dose-limiting. Clinically, NMF is administered both orally andby intravenous (IV) injection. The bioavailability with oral administrationis 90% to 95%. The highest reported plasma concentration of NMF is approximately4 mmol/L in a patient who received a dose of 2,000 mg/m2 of IV NMF. Biphasicelimination with IV NMF is seen on both the daily for five days and weeklyfor 3 weeks schedule. Approximately 5% to 7% of the total administeredIV dose is excreted in the urine. In phase I studies, dose-limiting toxicitiesincluded reversible hepatotoxicity, a generalized malaise syndrome, andnausea and vomiting. One partial response has been reported in the 111patients treated on phase II trials in colorectal, head and neck, andrenal carcinomas. Suggestions for the future development of this drugare presented. 82 references.</TEXT></DOC>
