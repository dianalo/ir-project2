Middleton, chief of the Computer-Aided Engineering Division of the corps'Information Technology Laboratory in Vicksburg, Miss., said the CADD programis ahead of those in other federal agencies.andM;&quot;I suspect the corps is moving ahead on a much broader front,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;CADD is not set aside for use here and there or just in researchlaboratories.andP;  It is being brought into our normal way of doing business.andP;  Idon't know of any other agency trying to do it on that scale.&quot;andM;Middleton said the corps has purchased about 600 CADD workstations.andP;  About260 are Intergraph Corp. workstations specifically for CADD.andP;  The rest arenetworked IBM-compatible PCs running Intergraph's MicroStation package.andM;&quot;If the price of PCs keeps dropping, I expect we will continue to buy a fairnumber of PCs,&quot; Middleton said.andP;  &quot;If PCs hold steady on price, we will startswitching over more to workstations.andP;  I think our net configuration is goingto be a mix of both.&quot;andM;In September 1987, the corps awarded Intergraph a contract worth up to $120million that allows the corps and other agencies to buy hardware, softwareand technology upgrades until September 1992.andP;  The contract coversmaintenance for three additional years.andM;Corps personnel cna purchase up to $50 million worth of the Intergraphequipment.andP;  Other agencies such as the Army, Air Force and State Departmentalso are authorized to spend up to $50 million.andP;  An extra $20 million worthof equipment or services may be bought for emergency defense operations andnatural disasters.andM;The Intergraph workstations are built around the company's Clipperreduced-instruction-set computing microprocessor.andM;Ar first, corps users bought Intergraph Series 200 and 300 workstationsrunning 5 million instructions per second (MIPS).andP;  The company in Octoberadded to the contract its 3000 Series with better memory and disk capacity.andO;Intergraph also has proposed adding to the contract its 6000 Seriesworkstations, which run at 10 MIPS and 14 MIPS.andM;Software developed by Intergraph includes the Engineering Site Package (ESP)for VAX applications; N-Roads, an enhanced version of ESP for UNIXworkstations; and RandMicas for structural modeling.andM;The corps develops its own software for specialized applications such as lockand dam design and structural stability analysis.andP;  Corps personnel havemodified the software to run on the Intergraph platform and createIntergraph-compatible files.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
