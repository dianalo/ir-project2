The intent of the test procedures is to providea comparable measure of energy consumption that will assist consumers inmaking purchasing decisions. These test procedures appear at 10 CFR part430, Subpart B and include both room and central air conditioners.On March 20, 1989, DeLonghi America Inc. (DeLonghi) submitted a petitionfor rulemaking to the Department of Energy requesting that the Secretarycreate a new covered product for portable, windowless, single-package typeair conditioners (PWAC) and establish test procedures for this product.DeLonghi, in its petition, proposed a test procedure which it feels willprovide accurate and fair ratings for comparison with other air conditioningproducts.A portable, windowless air conditioner is a unit that includes an evaporator,a condenser, and a compressor which is assembled in a cabinet that canbe moved from room to room. In this unit, the condenser is located indoorswithin the cabinet. The condenser has no contact with outdoor air as ina window-type room air conditioner. Water is used to cool the condenserin this appliance. Within the cabinet there is a water tank which mustbe refilled at intervals depending upon temperature setting, ambient temperature,humidity level, and timer setting, among other factors.The water tank is located in a water basin and a water pump provides watercirculation over the hot coils of the condenser. The water cooling thecondenser evaporates into steam and a ventilator fan discharges this steamthrough an exhaust hose outside the conditioned room. The exhaust hoseis generally fitted into either a window bracket, or an opening may beplaced thorugh a wall. It is also possible to place the hose outside ofthe area or room being cooled but still within the building structure.DOE has defined a room air conditioner as a product designed for ``mountingin a window or through-the-wall for the purpose of providing delivery ofconditioned air to an enclosed space.'' Since a PWAC is for applicationin a room and is not designed for through-the-wall or window installation,a PWAC does not fall within the definition for a room air conditioner.EPCA, as amended, defines a central air conditioner as ``a product, otherthan a packaged terminal air conditioner, which (A) is powered by singlephase electric current, (B) is air cooled * * *.'' Because the DeLonghiunit is water cooled it does not fall within the definition for a centralair conditioner.Therefore, DOE has determined that a PWAC is neither a room nor centralair conditioner for the purpose of the Department's energy conservationprogram for consumer products.DeLonghi in its petition requests that a new covered product be createdin category 14 in accordance with section 322(b) of the Act.Section 322(b) states that the Secretary ``may classify a type of consumerproduct if he determines that(A) classifying products of such type as covered products is necessaryto carry out the purpose of this Act, and (B) average annual per household energy use by products of such type islikely to exceed 100 kilowatt-hours (or its BTU equivalent) per year.''DeLonghi has not provided sufficient information to enable the Secretaryof Energy to determine what the average annual per household energy useof the product is and how this product fulfills the purpose of this Act.In addition, DOE must determine whether the product is a consumer productas defined by section 321(a)(1) of the Act. DeLonghi has not shown thatits product is distributed in commerce or has the potential to be distributedin commerce for personal use or consumption by individuals.DeLonghi has proposed a test procedure in its petition for rulemaking onwhich DOE invites comment. The test procedure submitted provides definitionsrelevant to the PWAC, rating conditions, classification methods, testingand rating requirements, performance requirements (at specific test conditions),cooling capacity calculations, and safety requirements.DOE requests that comments on the DeLonghi petition address the following:andbullet; Whether it is necessary to add this product to the program;andbullet; Whether this is a covered product, i.e. whether the product shouldbe considered either a room air conditioner or a central air conditioner;andbullet; Whether the product is distributed in commerce to a significantextent for personal use;andbullet; What is the product's annual household energy consumption; andandbullet; Whether the recommended test procedure is appropriate for usein rating the product's annual energy consumption and efficiency.Copies of the DeLonghi proposed test procedure are available by contactingDOE at (202) 586-9127, or by writing to the Department at the address givenearlier.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 430</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedures, Energy Conservation, Householdappliances.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, July 31, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John R.

Introduction.Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(e), DeLonghi America Inc., 625 Washington Avenue,Carlstadt, New Jersey 07072, on behalf of itself and its parent company,DeLonghi S.P.A. of Italy, a consumer and appliance products manufacturer(both entities hereinafter referred to collectively as ``DeLonghi''), respectfullyfiles this petition seeking initiation of a rulemaking. In the rulemaking,DeLonghi requests that DOE: (1) establish and define as a separate coveredconsumer product the ``movable, windowless, single-package type air-conditioner,''pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6292(a) and (b), and (2) prescribe a new test procedurefor determining the cooling capacity in Btu's per hour which can be usedto determine and express the energy efficiency ratio for this product,pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6293(b).In section 3.0 of the proposed test procedure, which is Attachment A \1\<NOTE/> to this petition, DeLonghi provides a proposed definitionfor this product which if adopted, would be added to the definitions in10 CFR 430.2. The proposed test procedure, if adopted, would be added asan Appendix to Subpart B of 10 CFR Part 430.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Attachment A is available upon request from DOE.II. Descriptionof the Movable, Windowless, Single-Package Type Air-Conditioner (Hereinafter``portable, windowless air conditioner'').DeLonghi produces and markets the ``Pinguino,'' a portable, windowlessair conditioner meeting the description in section 3.0 of the attachedproposed test procedure. Although DeLonghi believes that the Pinguino ispresently the only product of this type sold in the United States, similarproducts are manufactured and sold elsewhere in the world by other firms,and DeLonghi believes that some of these products will be sold in the UnitedStates in the future.Attachment B to this petition are technical descriptions of the Pinguinoas an example of this product type. In brief, the portable windowless airconditioner is a unit which includes an evaporator, a compressor, and acondenser. These components are assembled in a portable cabinet which canbe moved from room to room. Unlike the window-type room air conditionerin which the condenser is outdoors (exterior to the structure), in thisunit the condenser is indoors within the cabinet. The condenser has nocontact with outdoor air and therefore is not cooled by contact with outdoorair as is a window-type room air conditioner. Water is used to cool thecondenser in this appliance. Within the cabinet there is a water tank whichmust be refilled at intervals depending upon the temperature setting, ambienttemperature, humidity level, and timer setting, among other factors.The water tank is located in a water basin and a water pump provides watercirculation over the hot coils of the condenser. The water cooling thecondenser evaporates into steam and a ventilator fan discharges this steamthrough an exhaust hose outside the conditioned room. The exhaust hoseis generally fitted into either a window bracket, or an opening may beplaced through the wall. It is also possible to place the hose outsideof the area or room being cooled but still within the building structure.There are a variety of potential uses for the portable, windowless airconditioner, some of which functionally fall between common uses of windowroom air conditioners and uses of so-called spot air conditioners whichare commonly used in industrial applications. A partial listing of applicationsfor this product include:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Spot air conditioning for computer hardware and communications equipmentrooms</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Air conditioning medical offices or other similar rooms where windowunits are impractical or are considered to take up too much light and/ormay be considered to be too noisy</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Air conditioning rooms in apartments or other dwellings having windowsnot conducive for installation of window room air conditioners or wheresuch installation is not desirable</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Office and commercial space needing air conditioning in off hourswhere central air conditioning may not be operating or would be uneconomicallyemployed, such as during weekends.</ITAG>III. Need For A Separate Test ProcedureFor Portable, Windowless Air Conditioners.DeLonghi requested on September 29, 1988 an interpretation from DOE andthe Federal Trade Commission (``FTC'') essentially that the Pinguino isnot a ``room air conditioner'' or ``covered product'' as defined by DOEand FTC regulations, respectively. On October 14, 1988, DOE provided anopinion that the Pinguino is not a ``room air conditioner'' as definedby DOE or a covered product under the Department's Energy ConservationProgram for Consumer Products. In particular, DOE noted that it ``definesa room air conditioner as `an encased assembly designed as a unit for mountingin a window or through the wall.' The `Pinguino' is not designed for thismanner of installation; therefore, it is not a room air conditioner asdefined by the DOE.''The FTC staff followed on November 22, 1988 with an opinion that the Pinguinois not a ``covered product'' under the Commission's labeling rule becauseit does not meet the definition of a room air conditioner in andSection;305.3(e) of the rule (16 CFR part 305). Staff also stated that the Pinguinois not a consumer appliance product under andSection; 305.2(n) of the rulebecause, as indicated by DOE, there is no final test procedure for thePinguino.Although these opinions clarified the Pinguino's federal regulatory status,DeLonghi stated then and reiterates now that it would be desirable forconsumers if the Pinguino and similar products had an applicable test procedurefor measuring energy consumption and were subject to energy labeling requirementssimilar to those now imposed on room air conditioners. However, in orderto achieve those goals it will be necessary to develop a separate testprocedure for portable, windowless air conditioners.The existing room air conditioner test procedure cannot simply be extendedto the Pinguino through a revision in the definition of room air conditioner.The Pinguino type of product is designed such that the existing test procedurefails to measure its energy consumption characteristics accurately. Theventilating (condenser) fan which discharges steam from the exhaust hosemust draw air from the conditioned room, unlike conventional room air conditionerswhere the condenser is mounted in a manner so that condenser fan drawsair from the outside. A ventilating or condenser fan discharges steam fromthe exhaust hose which runs from the unit to either the exterior or outsidethe conditioned area. This discharge of air from the room being cooledresults in replacement air coming into the room from somewhere else, andthat must necessarily be either from some other interior room or area orpossibly from the outside of the building depending on air leakage conditions.The existing test procedure treats the exhaust air as being totally replacedby 95anddegrees; ambient ventilating air from the outside because it providesfor venting to maintain air pressure between the inside cooling area andthe outside 95anddegrees; air. This treatment is technically incorrect andinappropriate for this kind of air conditioner because most of the ``replacement''air is introduced from other rooms or areas adjacent to the conditionedroom with far less negative impact on the BTU/hr. rating (and thus theEER) than would occur if ``replacement'' air came entirely from the highertemperature exterior area.This statement of the deficiency or limits in the DOE test procedure isnot intended to be derogatory of the significant value of that test procedurefor the types of units for which it was designed. It simply points outthe need for a new, separate procedure for a functionally different unit.As DeLonghi committed at the time of its interpretational request to DOE,it has developed and presents as Attachment A a test procedure designedto accurately determine the cooling capacities of ``movable, windowless,single-package type air conditioners.''DeLonghi believes that this test procedure complies with the requirementsof 42 U.S.C. 6293(b)(3). It welcomes, however, the views of DOE and thetechnical community as consideration of its petition proceeds.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-18422 Filed 8-4-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6450-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
