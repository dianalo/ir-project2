About 2,000 repairmen reported for work and most others wereexpected to resume normal working schedules by late Thursday, astate railroad spokesman said.   More than 200 train drivers, brakemen, conductors and stationstaff who stopped work in sympathy with the repairmen also returnedto their posts, the spokesman said.   The striking repairmen demanded a 20 percent wage increaseretroactive to July 1987 after rejecting a 10.7 percent pay increasefrom the government.   On Wednesday, transport minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi met withstrikers at the biggest National Railways workshops in the westerncity of Bulawayo, and he said the government was working out a newoffer. He declined to elaborate.   Junior repairmen earn about $250 a month, rising to $700 inhigher grades.   Strikers said their action halted three-fourths of Zimbabwe'srail traffic, including freight services to the Indian Ocean portsof neighboring Mozambique and South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
