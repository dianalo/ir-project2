The pH of the rain varied between 4.2 and 8.0. The molaritiesof total dissociable strong acids ranged from 0.69 x 10{sup -5} to 10.64x 10{sup -5} while weak acids varied from 0.69 x 10{sup -5} to 9.66 x10{sup -5}. Scanning electron microscopy - X-ray analyses showed thepresence of sulfur on the surface of both inorganic and organic insolubleparticulates. The concentrations of the major anions in rain were asfollows: sulfate 0.2 - andgt; 20 ppm; nitrate 0.2 - andgt; 10 ppm; chloride andless; 0.1ppm and fluoride andless; 0.35 ppm. Calcium was the most abundant cation withconcentrations as high as 10 ppm. Ground level sulfur dioxide concentrationsat the rain sampling sites never exceeded 0.13 ppm/3 hr. However, cumulativesulfate and nitrate concentrations in the rain were more than sufficientto lower the pH below 3.0. It is suspected therefore, that a major portionof the sulfate and nitrate ions in the rain are in a nonacidic form inthis geographic region.</TEXT></DOC>
