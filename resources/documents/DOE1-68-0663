And invariably each initiative has in some fashion addressed, orconfronted, the topic of how to finance the various meritorious projectsidentified or analyzed. This paper is a description of several GEC initiativesto address this financing issue as part of the GEC's attempt to end storieswith successfully implemented projects throughout the Commonwealth ofPennsylvania. The paper is divided into three GEC initiatives. First,for the past three years the GEC has conducted a program to cofund feasibilitystudies for coal conversion and/or cogeneration. This program involvedthe direct participation of industries and institutions with state governmentin the economic and technical analysis of the energy projects. Second,the GEC in conjunction with other state agencies has embarked on a thirdparty financing initiative for state buildings. This initiative was undertakento enable capital constrained state agencies to embark on energy conservation,fuel conversion, and cogeneration projects. And third, fulfilling a needto give energy managers and planners a sophisticated yet simplistic toolfor analyzing the financial alternatives for energy projects, the GECdeveloped a software program called ENVEST.</TEXT></DOC>
