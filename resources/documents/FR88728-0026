Overview of Proposed Alternative Actions </ITAG>Policy Approaches Under section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), EPA is required to establishemission standards for hazardous air pollutants at a level which providesan ample margin of safety to protect public health. In <T3>Vinyl Chloride, </T3>the court set out a two-step decision processfor EPA to follow in setting NESHAP under section 112. The two steps setout in <T3>Vinyl Chloride </T3>are: (1) Determine a ``safe'' or ``acceptable risk''level, and (2) set the standard at the level_which may be lower but nothigher than the ``safe''' or ``acceptable'' level_that protects publichealth with an ample margin of safety. The court emphasized that judgmentsby EPA concerning scientific uncertainty are an important part of the processfor establishing NESHAP.As discussed in detail in Section V of this notice, the Agency is proposingfour alternative policy approaches for making these two decisions for NESHAP.Commenters should assume that the final decision on the NESHAP approachcould be one of the four described specifically in this notice or a variation.The final policy approach and the relative weight it gives to the variousrisk measures and uncertainties will become the framework for decisionson future NESHAP. Consequently, the Agency is interested in comments ongeneral implications of the alternative policy approaches as well as incomment on the specific applications to the four benzene source categories.The framework adopted for NESHAP will not apply to other Agency programs.The Court's interpretation of the process required for establishing NESHAPdid not extend to regulatory decisions under any other statute administeredby EPA; therefore, the Agency does not envision applying the process describedbelow to regulatory judgments under other Acts. Regulatory decisions underother Acts will continue to be made using individual deliberative processespursuant to those distinct statutory mandates. The alternative Policy approaches being proposed differ in how the questionof acceptable risk is addressed and in how uncertainty in risk measuresis considered. The agency is using both the four proposed approaches andthe applications of the approaches to the benzene source categories asa means to frame the public debate on these questions. The Administratorbelieves that the broad ramifications of any particular approach for establishingacceptable risk levels for all NESHAP should be subject to public debate,in order to elicit the fullest range of information on these importantdecisions.Each of the four approaches treats the acceptable risk decision differently.The major characteristics of the four proposed approaches to acceptablerisk and ample margin of safety decisions are described below. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach A. Case-by-Case Approach </ITAG>This is the only approach in which all the health information, risk measures,and potential biases, underlying assumptions, and quality (i.e., uncertainties)of the information are considered together in the acceptable risk decision.The preferred range for the maximum individual lifetime risk in this approachis 10^4 or less; however, different decisions on acceptable risk for variouspollutants and source categories may be made based on consideration ofall the health information. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach B. Incidence-Based Approach </ITAG>This approach only considers total incidence in the acceptable risk decision.All of the health information, the uncertainties, and individual risk arenot considered until the ample margin decision. The incidence level beingproposed as acceptable is 1 case/yr per source category. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach C. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^4 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproach The only parameter considered in determining acceptable risk is maximumindividual lifetime risk. The other health information, the uncertainties,and incidence are not considered until the ample margin decision. In thisapproach, a maximum risk of 1 andmultiply; 10^4 or lower is defined as acceptable.<ITAG tagnum="81">Apporach D. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^6 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproach This approach is similar to Approach C; however, acceptable risk is definedas a maximum individual lifetime risk of 1 andmultiply; 10^6 or lower. <ITAG tagnum="81">Ample Margin of Safety Decisions </ITAG>This decision is made the same way under the four alternative approaches.In each, all the health risk measures as well as technical feasibility,cost, estimation uncertainties, and economic impacts are considered. Aquestion of particular concern in these decisions is whether to requireall technically feasible controls for which costs are reasonable no matterhow small the risk reduction. Application of Approaches to Benzene Source Categories In reexamining the previous benzene decisions, the Administrator used dataand analyses available as of the publications in June 1984 and August 1985.The reassessment for coke by-product recovery plants used the estimatedimpacts which were revised after the June 6, 1984, proposal. The risk estimatesfor the benzene source categories and the acceptable risk determinationsunder the alternative approaches are summarized in Table I-1. Maleic anhydrideprocess vents are not included in this summary because benzene is no longerused to produce maleic anhydride. The ample margin of safety risk levelsand associated control levels determined under the alternative approachesare summarized in Table I-2. The standards under the alternatives includeno additional control, application of all known technology that is availableat a reasonable cost, and plantwide benzene emission limits, which arenot expected to be generally achievable in several source categories usingknown technology. The bases for these decisions are discussed in SectionsVII through X of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M002 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 2 11-12 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C </ITAG>Table I-3 summarizes estimates of major anticipated economic impacts ofthe ample margin decisions made under the approaches for the benzene sourcecategories. The estimates of number of facilities shown under ApproachesC and D to be permanently shut down (i.e., a closure) are based on limitsof known control technologies. These particular estimates are rough estimatesand are not based on economic analysis. The job loss estimates are alsorough approximations which include only the regulated plants. Estimatesof impacts on related industries and general communities are not includedand cannot be quantified at this time. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 2 14 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C </ITAG>As shown in Table I-3, ample margin decisions under the alternative approachesare estimated to result in widely varying cost and economic impacts. Thesedifferences arise due to differences in technical feasibility of achievingthe standards. Although under the court's decision in <T3>Vinyl Chloride, </T3>EPA may not take cost or feasibility into accountin setting an acceptable level of risk, those factors are relevant to thesecond, or ample margin of safety step. In any event, should widespreadclosure of facilities producing and using benzene result from any alternativestandard, significant social as well as economic impacts would result.Benzene is a basic chemical used to manufacture a diverse number of chemicalsand products; such as polystyrene, nylon, and synthetic rubber. These derivativesare used in consumer goods (toys, tires, packaging), household goods (refrigerators,carpeting), and transportation. Request for Comment Throughout this notice, comments and information are requested on specificareas. In addition, partly in response to the <T3>Vinyl Chloride </T3>decision, EPA is reexamining assumptions and decisionmethods it has relied upon in making section 112 hazardous air pollutantregulatory determinations. As part of that process, EPA is seeking to engagethe public and all interested parties in discussion concerning both specificelements of alternative proposals for benzene standards and a broader reexaminationof assumptions and decision methods. In an effort to structure that discussion, EPA has formulated the fouralternative approaches noted earlier for the control of hazardous air pollutantemissions under section 112 of the CAA. Today's <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice proposes these four approaches for thecontrol of air emissions of benzene and thereby provides the opportunityfor EPA to solicit comments from the public on a variety of issues associatedwith this reexamination of the Federal program for hazardous air pollutants.Determinations on many of these specific issues within the proposed benzeneregulation are expected to set precedents for the approach to be used forthe substantial number of forthcoming NESHAP decisions. Major areas onwhich the Administrator requests public comment include, among others:(1) Should EPA consider all risk information in decisions on risk acceptabilityor rely on a single numerical risk criterion? If multiple risk measuresare to be used as the basis for decisions on risk acceptability, how shouldEPA balance individual versus population risk reductions? (2) What health risk is acceptable not considering cost and technical feasibilityof achieving it? Moreover, what constitutes an ample margin of safety incases where all exposures pose some risk? (3) Should EPA require standards pursuant to the ample margin of safetydecisions under section 112 that are ``technology forcing''? What criteriashould EPA use to define the ``availability'' and ``feasibility'' of technologicalcontrols? (4) In the ample margin of safety determination, how should EPA balancethe residual health risks versus the possibility of plant closures? (5) How should uncertainty in risk estimates be considered in these decisions?(6) How should EPA balance the various risk, technical, and economic considerationsin ample margin of safety decisions? How should EPA consider the ramificationsof potential errors and uncertainy of judgments on technology capabilityand costs?(7) Should EPA allow site-by-site analyses by sources to comply with risktargets in lieu of reasonable worst-case emission limits?<ITAG tagnum="84">II.

Background </ITAG>Since the early 1900's, the scientific and medical communities have recognizedbenzene as a potentially toxic substance. Benzene was recognized as a potentialhuman carcinogen (leukemia) in the mid-1970's based on occupational studiesof synthetic rubber, chemical, and shoe workers. Other documented occupationaleffects include impairment of the blood-forming system, immunotoxicity,chromosome breakage, and neurotoxicity. Results of animal studies supportthe leukemogenic potential of benzene and show reproductive and developmentaltoxicity also. Benzene is common in our indoor and outdoor air. Major sources of benzeneinclude automobile exhaust, automobile refueling operations, consumer products,cigarette smoking, and industrial emissions. In 1977, the Administrator announced his decision to list benzene as ahazardous air pollutant under section 112 of the CAA (42 FR 29332, June8, 1977). Benzene was determined to be a hazardous air pollutant becauseof its carcinogenic properties. A hazardous air pollutant is defined asan<ITAG tagnum="20">* * * air pollutant to which no ambient air quality standard is applicableand which * * * may reasonably be anticipated to result in an increasein mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitatingreversible, illness.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Section 112(b)(1)(B) of the CAA requires EPA to establish emissionstandards for a hazardous air pollutant ``at the level which in [the Administrator's]judgment provides an ample margin of safety to protect the public healthfrom such hazardous air pollutant.'' The listing of benzene as a hazardous air pollutant led to the developmentof proposed standards for benzene emissions from maleic anhydride processvents, EB/S process vents, benzene storage vessels, and benzene equipmentleaks. These proposed standards were published respectively by EPA in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> in 1980 and 1981 (45 FR 26660, April 18, 1980;45 FR 83448, December 18, 1980; 45 FR 83952, December 19, 1980; 46 FR 1165,January 5, 1981). After receipt of comments from industry and members of the public, EPApublished a final rule setting an emission standard for benzene equipmentleaks on June 6, 1984 (49 FR 23498). On that date, EPA also withdrew itsproposed standards for maleic anhydride process vents, EB/S process vents,and benzene storage vessels (49 FR 23558). The withdrawal was based onthe conclusion that both the benzene health risks to the public from thesethree source categories, and the potential reductions in health risks achievablewith available control techniques were too small to warrant Federal regulatoryaction under section 112 of the CAA. Also on that date, EPA published aproposed standard for benzene emissions from coke by-product recovery plants(49 FR 23522). On August 3, 1984, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) filed apetition in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit, seeking review of the EPA's three withdrawals of proposed benzeneemission standards, and the EPA's final standard for benzene equipmentleaks (<T3>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</T3> v.<T3> Thomas</T3>, No. 84-1387 (hereafter referred to as ``<T3>Benzene</T3>'')). On October 17, 1984, NRDC petitioned EPA under section307(d)(7)(B) of the CAA to reconsider its decisions to withdraw standardsfor maleic anhydride process vents, EB/S process vents, and benzene storagevessels, and to reconsider the promulgated standard for benzene equipmentleaks. The EPA denied this petition on August 23, 1985 (50 FR 34144). On July 28, 1987, the court handed down an<T3> en banc</T3> decision in<T3> Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</T3> v.<T3> EPA,</T3> 824 F.2d 1146 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (hereafter referred to as``<T3>Vinyl Chloride</T3>'') (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3, Part I, Docket ItemX-I-4). The case concerns the emission standard under section 112 for vinylchloride. The court concluded in<T3> Vinyl Chloride</T3> that EPA had acted improperly in withdrawing aproposed revision to the standard for vinyl chloride by considering costsand technological feasibility without first determining a ``safe'' or ``acceptable''emissions level. In light of the<T3> Vinyl Chloride</T3> opinion, EPA requested a voluntary remand in<T3> Benzene</T3> to reconsider its June 6, 1984, rulemakings. In an orderdated December 8, 1987, the court approved the EPA's voluntary remand andestablished a schedule under which EPA must propose its action on reconsiderationwithin 180 days of the order and take final action within 360 days of theorder. This order was subsequently modified under a joint motion to extendthe time for proposal of actions by 45 days. The EPA also decided to reconsiderthe proposed standard for benzene emissions from coke by-product recoveryplants in light of the<T3> Vinyl Chloride</T3> decision and to publish a supplemental proposal.In reconsidering the previous decisions, the Administrator has used dataon emissions and plants, and analyses available as of the publicationsin June 1984, and the denial of the petition for reconsideration in August1985. The health information considered consists of the information availableat the time of the 1984 decisions as well as the recent assessment providedby the Agency for the Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) thatwas released for public comment in December 1987 (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3,Part I, Docket Item X-1-2). For coke by-product recovery plants, the estimatedimpacts were revised based on comments received after the June 6, 1984,proposal. These revised impacts were used in the Administrator's reconsideration.The EPA received in April 1988 from the American Petroleum Institute (API)a report entitled ``Quantitative Re-evaluation of the Human Leukemia RiskAssociated with Inhalation Exposure to Benzene.'' This report is in DocketNo. OAQPS 79-3, Part I (Docket Item X-D-2) and is available for publiccomment. Due to the limited time available between submittal of this reportand the court deadline, this information could not be evaluated beforethe reconsideration. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Characterization of Benzene Health Risks </ITAG>The characterization of the potential adverse health effects of human exposureto benzene emitted from the subject source categories is presented in fourparts: Hazard identification, dose/response assessment, exposure assessment,and risk characterization. Based upon the documented association betweenexposure to benzene and elevated leukemia incidence in occupational populations,the risk characterization section includes estimates of excess leukemiarisk for the general population exposed to benzene emissions from the subjectsource categories. The attendant uncertainties in these estimates are alsodescribed. Hazard Identification As a widely used organic chemical, the potential toxicity of benzene hasbeen recognized since the erly 1900's. Initially identified as a causativeagent in cases of bone marrow poisoning and blood abnormalities, the understandingof benzene's toxic properties has gradually expanded to include associationswith aplastic anemia and cancer. Although a tentative association between exposure to benzene and leukemiawas first documented in 1928, benzene was not broadly recognized as a potentialhuman carcinogen until the early 1970's with the publication of severalepidemiological studies of benzene-exposed workers reported by the OccupationalSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3, Part I,Docket Item X-J-2). Based on this evidence, the Administrator, on June8, 1977, announced a decision to list benzene as a hazardous air pollutantunder section 112 of the CAA. Supplementary information on the listingmay be obtained from the EPA document ``Response to Public Comments onEPA's Listing of Benzene under Section 112'' (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3, PartI, Docket Item VII-B-1). Although acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (leukemia) is not the only adversehealth effect attributed to benzene, the serious nature of this diseaseand the uncertainties regarding the existence of any risk-free levels ofexposure combined to make it of central importance in hazard assessment.The EPA's health basis for listing rested primarily on retrospective studiesin occupationally exposed human populations. Of these, three reports documentingan association received the greatest emphasis: Infante el al., publishedin 1977, Aksoy et al., published in 1976, and Ott et al., published in1977 (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3, Part I, Docket Items II-I-86, IV-J-16, andII-I-71). In the interval since the listing decision, additional humandata and animal data have become available which further support a casualrelationship. Notable in this regard are studies published in 1981 by Rinskyet al. of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)(Docket No. OAQPS 79-3, Part I, Docket Item IV-J-9) providing improvedfollow-up of the Infante cohorts, and a study by the Chemical ManufacturersAssociation (CMA) published by Wong et al. in 1983, of mortality amongchemical workers exposed to benzene (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3, Part I, DocketItem X-I-I). The results of these studies are summarized below. Infante et al. reported on a cohort of 748 white males occupationally exposedto benzene at any time between 1940 and 1949 at two facilities manufacturingrubber hydrochloride (pliofilm). The cohort mortality study revealed asignificant excess of leukemia deaths (7 observed versus 1.38 expected)associted with benzene exposure. Aksoy and co-workers reported the incidenceof leukemia between 1967 and 1973 among 28,500 Turkish shoe, slipper andhandbag workers exposed to airborne benzene. The shoe workers had morethan twice the rate of leukemia when compared to the annual leukemia incidencein the general population of Turkey. Ott et al. reported the long-termmortality patterns of 794 workers in chemical manufacturing facilities.Three deaths from leukemia were observed at a chemical plant among benzene-exposedemployees when only 0.8 deaths from leukemia were expected, a 3.75-foldexcess risk. Rinsky et al. (1981, 1987) provided a follow-up retrospectivemortality study of the benzene exposed workers in the pliofilm industry(Docket No. OAQPS 79-3, Part I, Docket Items IV-J-9 and X-I-3). In the1981 analysis in which the workers were followed through June 30, 1975,7 leukemia cases were observed as compared to 1.25 expected cases. Rinskyalso provided further detail on atmospheric benzene concentrations to whichthe workers were exposed. Rinsky et al. (1987) extended the follow-up ofthe cohort members to 1982. At this time, 9 cases of leukemia were observedwhen 2.7 were expected. Wong et al. examined the causes of death for 7,676 chemical workers employedfor at least 6 months between 1946 and 1975 (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3, PartI, Docket Item X-I-1). Upon comparison of specific mortality rates betweenworkers exposed and workers not exposed to benzene, the authors found significantincreased risk for benzene exposed workers of over four-fold when comparedto nonexposed workers. Seven leukemia deaths were observed in the exposedgroup, and none were observed in the nonexposed group. The EPA reviewed the weight of evidence of carcinogenicity from the variousoccupational studies and concluded that there is sufficient evidence ofa causal relationship between benzene exposure and leukemia. Based on thisevaluation, the Agency has classified benzene as Group A, a known humancarcinogen, following the procedures set forth in the EPA's Guidelinesfor Cancer Risk Assessment (51 FR 33992, September 24, 1986). In addition to leukemia, several of the studies described above noted increasesin other cancers, most notably lymphosarcoma and multiple myeloma, in benzene-exposedcohorts. In these cases, however, the data are currently considered insufficientto document an association. Animal studies that have been extensively reviewed in the OSHA rulemaking,offer general confirmation of the carcinogenic potential of benzene. Maltoniand Scarnoto (1979) reported that benzene administered orally to rats wasassociated with increases in tumors of the Zymbal gland and mammary tumors,as well as leukemia. (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3, Part I, Docket Item IV-J-6).Maltoni et al. (1982) found subsequently that Zymbal gland tumors wereinduced in rats exposed by inhalation exposure to benzene. Snyder et al.(1978) published a preliminary finding of myelogenous leukemia in miceexposed by inhalation to benzene (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3, Part I, DocketItem II-I-92). Snyder et al. (1980) also reported increased leukemia andlymphomas in mice exposed by inhalation of 300 parts per million (ppm)benzene, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week over a lifetime (Docket No. OAQPS79-3, Part I, Docket Item IV-J-7).In 1983, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) completed a 2-year chronicstudy of mice and rats orally exposed to benzene (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3,Part I, Docket Item IV-H-5). The study found a significant incidence incancers at multiple sites in both sexes and both species of rodent. Inrats an increased incidence of Zymbal gland carcinomas, skin cancer, andcancer of the oral cavity was observed. Increases in six types of tumorsincluding malignant lymphoma, preputial gland carcinoma, and lung cancerwere observed in male mice, and seven tumor types including lymphoma, lungcancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and liver cancer were found in femalemice.Toxic effects in humans, other than cancer, have been associated with benzeneexposure in various epidemiologic studies of occupationally exposed populations.Effects on the human hematopoietic (blood-forming) system have been documentedby OSHA (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3, Part I, Docket Item X-J-2). A common clinicalfinding in benzene hematotoxicity is a decrease in various cellular elementsof the circulating blood, termed cytopenia. This decrease can proceed toaplastic anemia, which is a rare disorder characterized by a reductionin all cellular elements in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. The OSHAhas observed a case fatality rate of 30 to 50 percent within the firstyear of diagnosis of aplastic anemia.The OSHA also reviewed numerous occupational studies in a recent rulemakingassociating chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells and peripherallymphocytes in workers exposed to benzene. Generally the epidemiologicstudies indicate that chromosomal breakage can occur at exposures at orbelow 10 ppm, 8 hours per day.Through the ATSDR with the help of EPA, the U.S. Public Health Servicehas recently reviewed the scientific literature on noncancer effects observedin animal studies (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3, Part I, Docket Item X-I-2). Thisreview found that animal inhalation studies are available showing adversesystemic effects such as bone marrow depression, injury to cells of thehematopoietic organs, and immunotoxicity. Numerous studies in whole animalshave associated the induction of bone marrow depression with inhalationexposure to benzene (Toft et al., Snyder et al., 1984). This effect generallyoccurs during short-term exposure to about 10 ppm benzene or above. Cellularimmune dysfunction in mice has been reported by Rosenthal and Snyder, andwas associated with short-term inhalation exposures of about 30 ppm benzene.A number of investigations cited in the ATSDR review have evaluated developmentaland reproductive toxicity in animals following inhalation exposure to benzene.These studies have shown that benzene is toxic to the developing embryoand fetus. Ward et al. (1985) observed that mice exposed to benzene at300 ppm for 13 weeks experienced changes in the ovaries and testes suchas atrophy, degeneration, and decreased spermatozoa. Ungvary and Tatrai(1985) demonstrated dose-dependent fetotoxic effects in mice and rabbitsexposed to benzene during gestation. Keller and Snyder (1985) demonstratedalterations in hematopoiesis in the fetuses and offspring of pregnant miceexposed by inhalation to 10 ppm benzene (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3, Part I,Docket Item X-J-2).Dose/Response AssessmentThe dose/response assessment addresses the relationship between the doseof benzene administered or received in the various human and animal studies,and the incidence of an adverse health effect in the exposed study population.Although human exposure to benzene in the workplace has been associatedwith leukemia, aplastic anemia, multiple myeloma, lymphomas, pancytopenia,chromosomal breakages, and depression of bone marrow, EPA believes thatthe leukemia incidence in epidemiologic studies provides the clearest associationbetween human exposures and the induction of disease for dose/responseestimation purposes. Toxicity of the hematopoietic system as well as cytogeneticeffects in humans have been causally related to benzene exposure; however,the magnitude and duration of dose required to elicit these effects arenot well known at this time. Thus, carcinogenicity, specifically leukemia,is currently the focus of greatest concern in estimating the potentialrisk to the general population exposed to benzene emitted from stationaryindustrial sources. The association between benzene exposure and humanleukemia is strengthened by observations of increased leukemia mortalityrates among independent cohorts in different occupational settings. Inaddition, individuals exposed to benzene were evaluated over a time periodthat spanned the latency of leukemia. Although a dose/response associationbetween cancer and benzene exposure has been demonstrated in rodent bioassays,EPA believes that human data, when available, should be given greater weightin assessing the potential risk to the benzene-exposed human population.Since a specific environmental carcinogen is likely to be responsible for,at most, a small fraction of a community's overall cancer incidence, andsince the general population is exposed to a complex mixture of potentialcausative agents, attempts to directly link actual human cancers with ambientair exposure to chemicals such as benzene are easily confounded. Epidemiologictechniques are generally not sensitive enough to measure such an associationdirectly. Therefore, EPA must rely upon mathematical modeling techniquesto estimate human health risks. These techniques, collectively termed ``quantitativerisk assessment,'' provide a means of mathematically estimating the riskof adverse health effects from ambient exposure to benzene by extrapolatingeffects found at higher occupational exposure levels to lower concentrationscharacteristic of population exposure in the vicinity of industrial sources.A key element in this extrapolation is the unit risk estimate (URE). Forbenzene this estimate is derived from the dose/response relationship observedin the occupational studies and represents the estimated upperbound onthe increased risk of contracting leukemia for an individual exposed fora lifetime (70 years) to a specific concentration of benzene (e.g., 1 ppm)in the air.In deriving the URE for benzene, EPA has used the geometric mean of fourURE (derived by maximum likelihood) based on two model types (additiverisk and multiplicative risk) each with two measures of exposure (unweightedand weighted cumulative exposure). It is assumed that the leukemia responseis linearly related to benzene dose, even at very low levels of exposure.The Office of Science and Technology Policy maintains that while thereare biological data supporting this approach, and epidemiologists havefrequently assumed a linear model for dose/response analysis of carcinogens,there are also data which suggest that, for some carcinogenic agents, thedose/response relationship is not linear, with the response decreasingfaster than the dose at low levels of exposure (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3,Part I, Docket Item X-J-1). At such low levels the nonlinear model producessmaller risk factors than the linear model.The possibility of a carcinogenic threshold for benzene, an exposure levelbelow which there would be no risk of leukemia, has also been debated (DocketNo. OAQPS 79-3, Part I, Docket Item VII-B-2). At present, the mechanismsinvolving the induction of leukemia following chronic benzene exposureremain largely unknown, and data are limited. In the absence of sound scientificevidence to the contrary, EPA has concluded that a nonthreshold presumptionrepresents appropriate scientific policy. The EPA has elected to use the linear nonthreshold assumption for the benzenedose/response assessment because it is generally considered to be conservativecompared to the nonlinear alternatives, is consistent with some proposedmechanisms of carcinogenesis, and provides a good ``fit'' for the benzenedata. This choice of models results in a plausible estimate of leukemiaunit risk to the exposed population. If true linearity holds at low environmentalexposures, then these numbers will overestimate risk 50 percent of thetime and underestimate risk 50 percent of the time. If the true low-dose/responserelationship is less than linear, then these estimates would err on thehigh end and in favor of the protection of the public health. The limiteddata from which the extrapolation is made are consistent with the linearmodel. On October 17, 1984, NRDC petitioned the Administrator of EPA to, in part,evaluate the most current scientific literature on benzene carcinogenicityand revise the EPA's URE accordingly. This petition culminated in an updateof the carcinogenic potency estimate for benzene summarized in a reportentitled ``Interim Quantitative Cancer Unit Risk Estimates Due to Inhalationof Benzene,'' (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3, Part I, Docket Item VIII-A-4). Inresponse to the concerns of the petitioner, EPA evaluated the risk implicationsof the epidemiological findings of the 1981 Rinsky et al. study of rubberworkers, the Wong et al. study of chemical workers, and the Ott et al.study of chemical workers, all of which were known to involve benzene exposurein the workplace (50 FR 34144, August 23, 1985) (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3,Part I, Docket Item IX-A-1). Although various animal bioassays were considered,EPA concluded that the URE for inhalation of benzene was appropriatelybased upon the epidemiologic studies since these studies were of recognizedquality, and had the greatest relevance in the estimation of health riskto humans. In the reevaluation of the URE, EPA pooled the leukemia responsesobserved in the 1981 Rinsky et al. and Ott et al. cohorts, and computeda geometric mean of each maximum likelihood point risk estimate. The observationsof Wong et al. were used as a comparison to the computed risk estimatesof the pooled studies. The resulting ratio between these two sets of datawas used to adjust the computed geometric mean estimate. Based on thesecalculations, the URE for benzene was revised in 1985 from an excess of2.2 chances in 100 of contracting leukemia for a lifetime exposure to 1ppm benzene in the air (0.022/ppm) to an excess of 2.6 chances in 100 (0.026/ppm)(50 FR 34146, August 23, 1985) (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3, Part I, Docket ItemIX-A-1). There are uncertainties inherent in the derivation of the URE for benzenethat can only be addressed qualitatively at this time. These uncertaintiesmay lead to either an overestimation or underestimation of the potentialleukemia risk to the exposed population. The derivation of the URE consideredonly the incidence of myelogenous leukemia in epidemiological studies.The URE might be increased by considering other types of cancers manifestedin the benzene exposed workers, e.g., multiple myeloma. In contrast, theassumption of low dose linearity in the risk modeling may tend to overestimatethe dose/response function if the true shape of the relationship is curvilinear.A third major area of uncertainty is that EPA has extrapolated the leukemiarisks identified for occupationally exposed populations (generally healthywhite males) to the general population in which susceptibility to a carcinogeniceffect could differ. Such susceptibility can differ with age, sex, geneticvariability, and present state of health. The URE for benzene may underestimatethe leukemia risk to more susceptible subgroups. Exposure Assessment Estimation of the potential leukemia risk associated with the emissionof benzene from industrial sources requires estimation of the concentrationsof benzene to which the population may be exposed, and determination ofthe magnitude of population exposure. In the absence of adequate monitoredambient air levels near the industrial sources, EPA used mathematical modelsto predict the dispersion of emissions and subsequent potential for humanexposure. Estimates of population exposure to benzene in the ambient air resultingfrom emissions from industrial sources were developed using the EPA's HumanExposure Model (HEM). The HEM accepts as inputs the locations and emissioncharacteristics of the subject source categories of benzene. This informationis combined with census and meteorological data contained in the modelto estimate the magnitude and distribution of population exposure. Emissionand plant parameters often must be estimated rather than measured, particularlyin determining the magnitude of fugitive emissions, and where there arelarge numbers of sources that individually emit small amounts of benzene.As discussed in more detail later in this notice, this can lead to overestimatesor underestimates of exposure. Similarly, meteorological data are not availableat specific plant sites, but are available only from the closest recordingweather stations that may or may not be representative of the meteorologyof the plant vicinity. The dispersion modeling of the emissions usuallyassumes that the terrain in the vicinity of the sources is flat. For sourceslocated in complex terrain where the surrounding topography is at higherelevation than the emission point, this assumption would tend to underestimatethe maximum annual concentration of benzene, although estimates of aggregatedpopulation exposure would be less affected. The exposure modeling also assumes that the population density in the vicinityof the source remains unchanged for 70 years and that the population isexposed for 24 hours per day for a 70-year lifetime. The exposure estimatesdo not consider the dynamics of population growth, decline, or mobility.This may lead to over- or underestimates of population exposure, dependingon the nature of population flux. The benzene exposure assessment alsoassumes the industrial sources under analysis will operate for 70 yearsto account for potential lifetime exposures. This assumption overestimatesmaximum and aggregate exposure. The degree of overstatement varies, however,among industries. The current exposure analysis does not include an analysis of indirectexposure pathways of benzene such as dermal absorption or ingestion. Furthermore,the analysis did not include concomitant exposure that may result frompollutants co-emitted from the sources. Exclusion of such factors may underestimatetotal potential exposure from these sources. A final uncertainty in theexposure analysis is that the current version of HEM does not account forpotential increased maximum exposures that may result from the co-locationof facilities, although EPA believes this effect would, in most cases,be very small. The mathematical exposure models predict population exposure based on theestimated rate of release of benzene from the industrial source categories.While no reliable benzene monitoring data exist in the vicinity of thesubject industrial source categories, EPA has reviewed a limited numberof measurements taken of benzene concentrations in urban and rural areasof the United States. Table IV-1 summarizes the range of measured benzeneconcentrations in urban and rural air. It must be emphasized that thesedata are the result of 24-hour measurements, and may not reflect annualaverage benzene concentrations in the atmosphere at those locations. Nevertheless,the data suggest that the average background benzene concentration in urbanareas ranges from about 1.5 to 6 parts per billion (ppb), and the averagebackground concentration of benzene in rural areas seems to be less than1 ppb.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 38 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C </ITAG>The principal sources of the ambient background levels of benzene are notwell understood. Benzene is both naturally occurring and has a fairly longatmospheric half-life. There is speculation that anthropogenic sources,especially tail-pipe emissions from mobile sources, may be largely responsiblefor these general background levels in the U.S.; however, EPA recognizesthe possible influence on benzene levels in urban areas from petrochemicalfacilities, chemical manufacturing facilities, and other industrial sourcesof benzene located in these cities. Risk Characterization The exposure estimates obtained from the HEM are combined with the estimateof carcinogenic potency for benzene (``unit risk'') to calculate the probabilityof the increased risk of cancer in the exposed population. In combiningthe estimates of population exposure with the URE for benzene, two measuresof excess leukemia risks are calculated: the aggregate population risk,and the maximum individual lifetime cancer risk. Individual lifetime riskscan also be expressed in terms of population risk distribution. The aggregatepopulation risk, expressed as annual cancer incidence, is defined as theaverage number of excess cancer cases expected annually in the exposedpopulation residing in the vicinity of the industrial sources of benzene.This measure is obtained by dividing the expected excess lifetime incidenceby 70. The maximum individual lifetime cancer risk is defined as the probabilityof contracting cancer following a lifetime exposure to benzene at the maximummodeled long-term ambient benzene concentration. Estimates of maximum individuallifetime cancer risk are usually expressed as a probability representedin scientific notation as a negative exponent of 10. A risk of contractingcancer of 1 chance in 10,000 is written as 1 andmultiply; 10^4, 1 chancein 1,000,000 as 1 andmultiply; 10^6, etc. These risks, because of the uncertaintiesand assumptions inherent in the dose/response assessment and exposure assessment,cannot be construed as absolute measures of the true risk burden to thebenzene exposed population. The quantitative risk assessment is best viewedas a relative estimate of the likelihood of cancer associated with benzeneemissions from the industrial source category, for comparision with estimatesfrom alternative emission scenarios or other benzene source categories.The estimated maximum individual lifetime cancer risk and annual cancerincidence resulting from inhalation exposure to predicted ambient concentrationsof benzene emitted from the industrial source categories are summarizedin Table IV-2.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 241 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C </ITAG>As was noted in the dose/response subsection, the estimated excess cancerrisk estimates calculated from the URE are based on leukemia mortalityin rubber and chemical workers exposed to benzene. One uncertainty in thequantative risk assessment involves the linear extrapolation from relativelyhigh occupational benzene exposures to much lower predicted ambient exposuresin the vicinity of the industrial source categories. The study by Ott etaal. demonstrates a four-fold increase in leukemia for workers who had beenexposed to average benzene concentrations of about 5 ppm for an averageof about 9 years. Furthermore, two out of the four individuals in the studywho died from leukemia were characterized as having been exposed to averagebenzene levels below 2 ppm. Case 2, for example, had 1.5 ppm-years cumulativebenzene exposure over 18 months. Daily exposures in the NIOSH cohort weremore typically in the range of 20 to 40 ppm over an 8-hour shift (DocketNo. OAQPS 79-3, Part I, Docket Item II-J-9).By comparison, EPA has estimated maximum modeled annual ambient benzeneconcentrations near the industrial source categories of benzene emissionsto range from 0.8 ppb (near an EB/S facility) up to 230 ppb (near a cokeby-product recovery plant). Thus, the highest predicted ambient air exposuresto benzene are at least roughly one order of magnitude lower than thoseassociated with increased leukemia risk in the epidemiological studies.In addition, an elevated leukemia risk has not been detected in the vicinityof stationary sources emitting benzene; however, it is very unlikely thatsuch an association could be detected, given the limited power of epidemiologicalstudies. The subsequent sections of this notice provide tables of the distributionof lifetime cancer risk and an estimate of the number of people that mayfall within a particular risk interval. These risk distributions are specificto benzene emissions from the industrial sources identified in Table IV-2.Sources that are located within the HEM exposure modeling radius (e.g.,20 to 50 km) of each other would result in an overestimation of the numberof people exposed to the long-term predicted benzene concentration. However,the estimates of aggregate population risk are not affected by this particularmodeling approach. That is because with a linear dose/response model, twoindividuals exposed to a concentration of 1 ppm benzene represent the samepopulation risk as one individual exposed to a concentration of 2 ppm benzene.The maximum individual lifetime risk will almost never be significantlyaffected by proximity of sources unless the industrial sources are locatedvery close together. This is because the predicted benzene concentrationswithin the modeling radius decline quickly with distance from the emissionpoint. In the rare cases where sources are very close in proximity (within200 to 300 meters), the maximum individual lifetime risk may be underestimated.The estimated distribution of individual cancer risks, however, is affectedby the proximity of sources. Correction for double counting of exposedindividuals would somewhat increase the individual risk for the populationwho are exposed to more than one source. Elimination of double countingmay shift some of the population at the lower risk levels (i.e., 10^6)to the next higher risk level. However, the principal effect of eliminatingdouble counting would be a reduction in the number of people in the middleto lower risk categories. Other factors of the quantitative risk assessment may tend to overestimateor underestimate the computed benzene risks. The relative uncertainty associatedwith the derivation of the cancer risk estimates can only be qualitativelydiscussed. The EPA currently cannot statistically describe the error rangeassociated with each of the assumptions comprising the quantitative riskassessment. For example, the fact that the risk assessment focused onlyon leukemia and not other forms of cancer that have been causally linkedwith benzene exposure in epidemiological studies may lead to an underestimationof the overall potential cancer risk. In addition, the risk analysis excludesconsideration of serious, noncancer effects associated with occupationalexposure to benzene. Though it is not known whether such effects couldoccur at much lower ambient benzene exposures, there remains a possibilitythat the current analysis may underestimate the total potential populationhealth risk.  Although benzene exposure has been associated with other cancer and noncancereffects (multiple myeloma, lymphomas, aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, depressionof blood cells, and chromosomal aberrations), EPA has determined that leukemiaincidence in workers provides the strongest basis for quantitative riskassessment. Departure from the assumption of nonthreshold, low dose linearityinherent in the derivation of the URE for benzene might result in lowerestimates of benzene's carcinogenic potency. The Agency does not find,however, that there is sufficient scientific evidence given the currentknowledge of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, to warrant departure fromthe nonthreshold and low dose linearity assumptions.  The assumptions involving the exposure assessment may tend to overestimateor underestimate risk. The dispersion modeling normally assumes flat terrainin the vicinity of the source. For sources located in rolling or complexterrain, this assumption would tend to under-predict maximum benzene exposureand maximum individual lifetime risk. Other assumptions are likely to overestimatethe exposure to the most exposed subset of the population. Maximum individuallifetime risk estimates are based on the assumption that the individualis exposed for 70 years to the estimated maximum annual average concentrationand that the source continues to operate for 70 years. The degree of overestimationwill vary among industries and as a function of individuals' movements. A final factor of uncertainty in the risk assessment is the fact that theanalysis did not account for individuals within the exposed populationwho may be uniquely susceptible to benzene carcinogenesis because of incompetentimmunity, or chronic infirmity. For this subgroup within the exposed populationthe risks may be underestimated.  <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Policy  </ITAG>Legal Framework Under Vinyl Chloride  The EPA considers the <T3>Vinyl Chloride</T3> decision to further define the legal frameworkfor setting NESHAP under section 112 of the CAA. The court set out a two-stepprocess for EPA to follow in making these judgments: (1) Determine a ``safe''or ``acceptable'' risk level, and (2) set the standard at the level_whichmay be lower but not higher than the ``safe''' or ``acceptable'' level_thatprotects public health with an ample margin of safety.In this case, the court emphasized that judgments by EPA concerning scientificuncertainty are an important part of the process for establishing NESHAP.As the court noted, Congress, in directing EPA to set NESHAP, recognizedthat uncertainties over the health effects of the pollutants greatly complicatethe task. <T3>Vinyl Chloride, </T3>824 F.2d at 1152.

The court stated that the Administrator must basethe ``safe'' decision on ``an expert judgment'' concerning ``the levelof emissions that will result in an `acceptable' risk to health (<T3>Vinyl Chloride</T3>, 824 F.2d at 1164-65).''

This scheme is unlike any other under the CAA itself, or anyof the other statutes administered by EPA because the acceptable risk thatEPA adopts in the first step cannot be exceeded by the standard EPA adoptsin the second step.In contrast, other EPA statutes have very different structures and legalrequirements for decisionmaking on public health standards. For example,while the Safe Drinking Water Act provides for two separate decisions,the first is a purely health-based goal toward which to work, but not necessarilymeet; the second is an enforceable standard that is based on cost and feasibilityconsiderations. Under both the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) andthe Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the balancingof health concerns and benefits of continued chemical use, and controlcosts are explicitly provided for in decisionmaking. The Resource Conservationand Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,and Liability Act both require statutory decisionmaking very differentfrom the bifurcated process mandated by the court for section 112.Although not reflected in the <T3>Vinyl Chloride </T3>decision reviewed by the D.C. Circuit, the EPA'srecent judgments under section 112 were made in integrated approaches thatconsidered a range of health and risk factors, as well as cost and feasibilityin certain cases. These approaches were followed in NESHAP for the sourcecategories of radionuclides, arsenic, and the prior decisions on benzenesource categories (49 FR 23498, 49 FR 23522, 49 FR 23558, 50 FR 5190, 50FR 7280, 51 FR 27958, 51 35056). However, the <T3>Vinyl Chloride </T3>decision eliminates those approaches to section112, since the integrated approaches did not partition consideration ofhealth factors into a first step separate from consideration of the otherrelevant factors.Thus, the <T3>Vinyl Chloride</T3> decision forces EPA to consider whether a riskis acceptable <T3>without</T3> at the same time considering benefits of the activitycausing risk, feasibility of control, or other factors that EPA (or anyone)would normally consider in deciding whether a risk was ``acceptable.''This problem is particularly acute in the case of many carcinogens, forwhich the Agency has stated that it is unable to identify a threshold no-effectlevel.The very examples cited by the court bring home the unusual nature of thecourt's ``acceptable risk'' decision step. The court (quoting the SupremeCourt's decision in the <T3>OSHA Benzene Case</T3>) cited ``driving a car or even breathing cityair'' as activities that ``few people would consider * * * `unsafe.' ''But driving a car entails risks that most people would consider high; theannual incidence approximates 50,000 fatal accidents, and the average individualrisk (not the maximum, but the actuarial average risk) approximates a 1in 100 chance of automobile-related death over a 70-year lifetime. Yetthe court was correct to say that our society accepts (or tolerates) riskfrom driving cars. As a society we continue to try to reduce the levelof risk, but we value the benefits in increased mobility that the automobileaffords. The same is true of ``breathing city air''_leaving aside the circularity(city air may contain some of the contaminants that EPA is consideringregulating), individuals live in cities to be close to the workplace, forthe recreational and cultural advantages associated with cities, and fora variety of reasons extrinsic to the risk itself.If decisions on the acceptability of risks are inherently balancing judgments,how is EPA to make those judgments on acceptability? Later in this section,EPA sets forth four approaches that deal with this issue in differing ways.The approaches cover a range of possible risk levels and they give prominenceto different measures of risk, e.g., individual versus population risk.The purpose is to elicit comment that will contribute to the EPA's resolutionof the decisionmaking problems presented by <T3>Vinyl Chloride. </T3><ITAG tagnum="81"/><T3>Survey of Societal Risk</T3> After assessing the health risks for emissions of a specific hazardousair pollutant, the Administrator, in following the <T3>Vinyl Chloride </T3>decision, is next faced with the question of howto determine an acceptable risk for a particular source category emittingthat pollutant. This question cannot be answered in a vacuum, but requireshim to determine ``what risks are acceptable <T3>in the world in which we live.'' </T3>824 F.2d at 1165 [Emphasis added].Such a determination requires some context within which to evaluate andcompare risks and other health factors bearing on that question. In approaching the question of what level of risk is ``acceptable or ``safe,''EPA surveyed a range of health risks that our society faces. The objectiveof this survey was to develop information to place the benzene risk estimatesin perspective. Thus, the survey included risks encountered in everydaylife, such as driving a car and breathing city air, which were cited inthe <T3>Vinyl Chloride </T3>decision, as well as a range of regulatory judgmentsor risks. The EPA surveyed both the individual risk and the incidence inthe population exposed to risk associated with the activities. Consideringincidence comports with the purpose of section 112 to protect ``publichealth'' when incidence is viewed as a measure of health of the populationas a whole. The risks surveyed ranged from individual risks of 1 in 10 (10^1) to lessthan 1 in 10,000,000 (10^7). Everyday risks include risks from naturalbackground radiation as well as risks from home accidents. Natural backgroundradiation at sea level creates individual lifetime cancer risks in therange of 3 in 1,000 (10^3) and an estimated 10,000 cancer cases per year.Naturally occurring radon in homes poses an additional source of radiationrisk, and these risks can be as high as 1 in 100 to 1 in 10 (10^2 to 10^1) and cause an estimated 5,000 to 20,000 cancer cases/yr. In the U.S.,accidents, natural disasters, and rare diseases pose individual risks ofdeath from 1 in 10,000 (10^4) (e.g., tripping and falling which cause approximately470 deaths per year) to 1 in 10,000,000 (10^7) (e.g., rabies which causesan average of 1.5 deaths per year).Judgments on risks have also spanned a broad range of risk levels. TheNational Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement (NCRP), followingrecommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection,has recommended that maximum individual exposures be limited to an amountcorresponding to risks of 3 in 1,000 (3andmultiply;10^3).The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) establishes tolerances for poisonousor deleterious substances, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's), ata level found necessary to protect the public health, taking into accountthe extent to which the substance is required or unavoidable in the foodsupply and the other ways the consumer may be affected by the same substance.For example, FDA has established a tolerance level for PCB's in fish atan individual risk of 7andmultiply;10^5, which would result in 34 cancercases each year among heavy fish consumers alone (44 FR 38333, June 29,1979).The EPA regulates pesticide uses under the FIFRA based on whether the pesticidecreates unreasonable adverse effects, a statutory term defined as requiringbalancing risks and benefits. The EPA has authorized some uses of the pesticidechlorobenzilate that would create individual risk of 1andmultiply;10^6 to7andmultiply;10^6, and would result in 2 to 9 additional cancer cases peryear (EPA banned other uses of this pesticide).Regulatory judgments have also been made to require lower risks. For example,under the provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), whichprovides that ``no residue'' from carcinogenic additives to animal feedmay remain in any edible portion of the animal, FDA has established a policyof not allowing the use of additives that create a risk to the animal higherthan 1 in 1,000,000 (1andmultiply;10^6). A more complete description of therisks EPA considered is presented in a document in the docket entitled,``Survey of Risks'' (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3, Part I, Docket Item X-B-1).No fixed risk level could be identified as acceptable in all cases andunder all regulatory programs for two main reasons. First, as discussedabove, in most cases the calculation of risks depends on different data,assumptions, and uncertainties. For example, the risk associated with motorvehicle and other common accidents can be calculated directly from accidentrecords and therefore reflect actual risk; whereas environmental risksare based on estimating procedures and assumptions and therefore are moreuncertain. Thus, actuarial and environmental risk estimates cannot be directlycompared so as to draw precise judgments as to whether one risk is larger,or less acceptable, than another. Second, acceptability of risk is a relativeconcept and involves consideration of different factors. Considerationsin these judgments may include: The certainty and severity of the risk;the reversibility of the health effect; the knowledge or familiarity ofthe risk; whether the risk is voluntarily accepted or involuntarily imposed;whether individuals are compensated for their exposure to the risk; theadvantages of the activity; and the risks and advantages for any alternatives.Thus, different judgments on acceptability can be made for similar numericalrisks. In addition, the uses of individual risk and incidence as comparativefactors face limitations since the relative size of the risks associatedwith an activity are sensitive to how the activity is defined. For example,the individual risk and incidence associated with a single leaking pipeat a plant within a particular industry could be quite small, but the cumulativerisks associated with all plants within the industry could be significant.This limitation can be ameliorated by careful selection of the appropriatecategory of sources.In summary, EPA surveyed and considered this risk information to provideperspective on society's consideration and acceptance of risks. In itsconsideration, EPA is not judging whether each of the risks presented hereis acceptable or unacceptable. They are presented, instead, to providea context for evaluating the relative public health implications of a rangeof activities and the risks presented in activities being considered forregulation under section 112.General NESHAP Policy ConsiderationsThe purpose of this section is to discuss and solicit comments on the appropriatecriteria for the two decisions the <T3>Vinyl Chloride</T3> opinion requires. In the two decisions EPA willboth consider the information available to it relating to measures of healthrisk, and take into account the limitations and uncertainties of the riskestimation methods and basic data. In the discussion which follows, therisk estimates, methods, and their limitations and uncertainties will bediscussed, and four approaches to making the two ``acceptable risk'' and``ample margin of safety'' decisions will be proposed. Comments are solicitedon all aspects of the discussion and the four approaches and potentialcombinations of approaches. Commenters should assume that the final decisionon the approach to be used and the policies adopted about relative weightto be given to various parameters and related factors will apply not onlyto the decisions before the Agency in this proceeding, but also may becomethe policies for decisions on future NESHAP. The framework adopted willnot, however, apply to other Agency programs or other sections of the CAA.The main purpose of the discussion presented here is to provide a basisfor comment on the major policy issues raised by the court's opinion, inparticular, on the requirement that in regulating under CAA section 112the Agency must decide what risk is acceptable in ``the world in whichwe live.'' In the months since the court's decision, issues about acceptabilityof risk from air toxics have been the subject of discussion both withinthe Agency and in public debate. The four alternative policy approachesoutlined address the acceptable risk decision in different ways. Each approachwould answer the following questions in a different way. The basis questionsare: What measure or measures of risk should be given weight in the acceptablerisk decision? Are there specific levels of individual or population riskthat are acceptable? How should EPA balance individual versus populationrisk reductions? Should the same levels be set and the same measures appliedfor all NESHAP? How should uncertainty in risk estimation be considered?The approaches described include one in which all risk information andmeasures available as well as estimation limitations and uncertaintiesare considered in determining acceptable risk on a case-by-case basis.Other approaches simply apply one quantitative risk parameter, either riskto the maximally exposed individual or aggregate risk of increased cancerincidence in the population (population risk). The approaches also varyin the level of risk that would be acceptable. The details of the resultsof applying each of the approaches to benzene source categories are describedin Sections VII through X of this preamble. A later part of this sectiondescribes the effects of single-criterion approaches on source categoriesfor pollutants other than benzene.Three of the approaches use either maximum individual risk or populationrisk as the criterion for acceptable risk. Some take the view that addedcancer risk to the individual is the most, or only, important measure.Two of the approaches use this as the only criterion for acceptable risk.Others would consider the number of people at risk and the estimated addedcancer incidence in the population to be most important. One of the approachesuses incidence as the only criterion for acceptable risk. Arguments infavor of the individual risk measure are that no individual should be athigh risk, that considering the number of people at risk leads to acceptanceof higher individual risk when few people are exposed, and that it is inequitablefor acceptable risk to an individual to depend upon the number of peoplesimilarly exposed. Arguments favoring use of added incidence are that itis an appropriate measure of total public health impact and this totalrisk to the population is a good indicator of acceptable risk. On the otherhand, incidence is only one of a number of possible health effects andthus may not accurately measure the total health impact nor total populationrisk. Comments on these issues and on using these parameters singly orin combination are requested.Uncertainty of risk estimates is also dealt with differently by the alternativeapproaches. Under Approach A, the case-by-case approach, all risk factorsincluding estimation uncertainties would be considered in the acceptablerisk determination. Approaches B, C, and D use a single risk measure asthe criterion for the acceptable risk decision and thus would leave considerationof other risk measures and specific judgments concerning much of the overalluncertainty until the second step, the ample margin of safety decision.How to weigh these uncertainties is a problem under any approach becausewhile the Agency often has quantitative estimates of uncertainty to useon specific elements of the risk assessment, it can often only make a qualitativejudgment about whether the overall uncertainty in the methods and assumptionshas resulted in an over- or underestimated risk. Comment is solicited onthe consideration of uncertainty in acceptable risk decisions.Each alternative deals similarly with the ample margin of safety decison.In each, all the health information as well as cost, technical feasibility,estimation uncertainties, and other relevant factors would be considered.Comment is requested on five issues in particular. First, is the marginof safety step more suitable than the acceptable risk step to take intoaccount (usually qualitatively) the direction and extent of estimationuncertainties? Second, should all technically feasible and affordable controlsbe required without regard to whether any significant risk reduction isassociated with the control? Third, should the Agency adopt a policy ofusing the ample margin step to force technology to reduce risk? Fourth,how should EPA balance the various risk, technical, and economic considerationsin ample margin of safety decisions? Fifth, what criteria should EPA useto define the ``availability'' and ``feasibility'' of technological controls?The remainder of this section covers various risk measures, how they arederived, general questions regarding control technology and plant closureconsiderations, and the four alternative regulatory approaches. The approachesare considered from the perspective of application to the benzene sourcecategories covered in today's notice and to the NESHAP program.Risk Measures Considered in NESHAP Policy ApproachesIn decisions on cancer risks from stationary sources of hazardous air pollutants,the Agency has estimated three measures of health risk. These are termed``maximum individual risk,'' ``risk distribution,'' and ``incidence''.Each of these combines an estimate of the dose/response for a pollutantwith estimates of exposure to the pollutant. The response estimated isthe pollutant-related increase in the probability that an individual willdevelop cancer in his or her lifetime. The exposure estimated is the averagedaily exposure assuming continuous exposure for 70 years.<ITAG tagnum="81">Maximum Individual Risk</ITAG>Individual risk is expressed as an estimated probability, e.g., 1 in 100(10^2), 1 in 1,000 (10^3), 1 in 10,000 (10^4). Thus, a 1 x 10^3 individualrisk is an <T3>added </T3>``chance'' of 1 in 1,000 of developing cancer sometime inthe individual's lifetime.In this discussion, the maximum individual lifetime risk is the additionto cancer risk of a person due to continuous exposure for 70-year lifetimeat a point of maximum concentration of a pollutant emission. (The maximumindividual risk is sometimes called the maximum exposed individual risk).This estimate is based on the fact that the concentration of an emission,and the consequent risk, diminishes with distance from its source. ForNESHAP decisions, the practice has been to estimate this figure for thelargest annual average pollutant concentration to which any member of thepublic may be subject according to census data on residence locations.It has also been estimated in other Agency decisions as the maximum atthe source perimeter.The maximum individual lifetime risk is different from average individualrisk which is sometimes estimated for sources like public drinking watersystems or food in which the concentration of a pollutant and other factorsare assumed to be equal at all distribution locations. This distinctionis particularly relevant when considering the maximum risk one might findacceptable from different sources.In using the maximum individual risk in acceptable risk decisions for hazardousair pollutants, its limitations should be considered. Used alone, the measuredoes not tell how many people may be so affected; it relates only to therisk to the most exposed individual(s).<ITAG tagnum="81">Risk Distribution</ITAG>A risk distribution estimates how many persons within a certain distance(e.g., 20 to 80 km) of a source of pollutant emissions are at what levelof individual risk (see, e.g., Table V-1A shown in the discussion of ApproachA later in this section). Typically, the distribution is given for 10-foldincrements of individual risk. Such a distribution provides the decisionmakerwith information on both the individual risk level for those exposed andthe number of persons exposed at each level. For NESHAP and other decisions,the Agency has examined risk distributions both as measures of risk andto compare the effects of various strategies for risk reductions acrossa source category.In making an acceptable risk decision, one relevant consideration couldbe how many people are exposed at each risk level, e.g., a 10^2 risk mightbe acceptable if only one person were at that level, but not if 1,000 peoplewere subject to it. Similarly, the numbers of persons exposed at variousindividual risk levels could be an important element in deciding on acceptablerisk. The risk distribution could be used in a similar way to considerwhether an ample margin of safety exists.<ITAG tagnum="81">Incidence</ITAG>Incidence is an estimate of population, rather than individual, risk. Incidenceestimates the addition to population cancer incidence in the specifiedpopulation. It is derived by multiplying individual risk by the estimateof the number of persons at that level of risk. This number which providesa lifetime population risk figure is then divided by 70 (years) to givean annual cancer incidence estimate. The incidence parameter can be usedas an estimate of impact on the entire exposed population within a givenarea by totalling the incidences associated with each increment of individualrisk. Incidence can also be portrayed along with individual risk and populationnumbers in a risk distribution (e.g., see Table V-1A shown in the discussionof Approach A later in this section). Typically, the Agency weighs incidenceestimates in conjunction with maximum individual risk or average individualrisk estimates. Estimated incidence generally is a particularly informativeparameter when looking at aggregate risk from a category of like sources.One feature to take into account whenever it is used is its dependenceon the size of the source category.<ITAG tagnum="81">Uncertainties in Risk Measures</ITAG>Each of the three risk parameters defined above has three elements. Theseare the estimated response per unit of pollutant concentration (e.g., ppmin air), the estimated exposure concentration, and the estimation of thepopulation residing in the area of the sources (usually taken from censusdata).Uncertainties exist in estimating each of these elements for a varietyof reasons including the fact that the relevant data and our understandingof the biological events involved are not complete. Where data gaps exist,qualitative and quantitative assumptions are made and science policiesare invoked which are based on our present understanding of biologicalmechanisms of cancer causation, estimates of air dispersion, engineeringestimates, and other factors. Alternative plausible assumptions are oftenavailabale for interpreting given data. Selection of certain assumptionsto be used is a science policy choice. The Agency has published guidelinescovering many of these for both cancer risk assessment and exposure assessment.They are ``Final Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment,'' 51 FR 33992(September 24, 1986) and ``Final Guidelines for Estimating Exposures,''51 FR 34042 (September 24, 1986).The following is a general outline of methods used to calculate these parameters,together with a few examples of some of the uncertainties.  Risk assessment under EPA guidelines takes into account the nature andamount of evidence that the agent will cause the effect of concern in humansas well as the uncertainties of interpretation of data and its quantification.When the toxicity data are from human studies, as they are for benzenewhich is a known human carcinogen, there are fewer uncertainties aboutthe hazard of dose/response considerations than when they are solely fromanimal studies. Nevertheless, there are important uncertainties in usinghuman data; these are explored in Sections IV and VII through X of thisnotice with regard to benzene. Examples include the fact that human epidemiologicalstudies are often retrospective and measure effects of exposure that occurredmany years in the past. The level of exposure to the agent at that timeusually must be estimated and cannot be verified. Also, the human studiesare often of workers exposed to the pollutant. Workers populations arenot representative of the general population with respect to age, and usuallynot with respect to sex. Workers are also generally the healthier segmentof the population. These factors of exposure and representation of humansensitivity to the agent can lead to over- or underestimation of risk.These are two of the important uncertainties; others exists.  When data from tests of a pollutant's carcinogenic activity in animalsare used, uncertainties about exposure are experimentally controlled, butother uncertainties arise. Many of these concern the use of data from animaltests to estimate effects on humans. Many relationships have to be accountedfor in doing this, for example, the equivalent dose for humans and laboratoryanimals given the size differential, and potential differences in metabolismand excretion of a chemical pollutant.  It is uncommon for there to be enough data to address all of the uncertainties.In addition to qualitative uncertainties of drawing conclusions about riskto the general populations from either human epidemiologic data or animaldata, uncertainties arise in extrapolating the observed dose/response relationshipfrom either workplace or animal test exposures to the usually lower doselevels of the general population.  In estimating exposure, the dispersion of a pollutant from a source isusually quantified by a predictive mathematical model using a known ormodel source emission rate, temperature, and velocity characteristics,and weather patterns at nearby stability array (STAR) stations; these aretypically the nearest recording weather station. The model predicts theconcentration of the dispersed pollutant at various distances from thesource. Standard assumptions are that the population around the sourceresides there for a 70-year lifetime and is continuously exposed to themodeled concentrations for 24 hours a day. The amount of emissions canbe derived from sampling and analysis of emissions at the source or fromengineering estimates, with more or less uncertainty associated with eachmethod according to the type of emission. There are varying degrees ofaccuracy and precision in sampling, analysis, estimates of emissions, orassumptions about the half-life of the pollutant in the air. Uncertaintiesin the method of estimating individual exposure and the number of individualsexposed are numerous. The method of estimating the resident populationand its location according to the census does not account for the factthat residents may be outnumbered by the workers or students who resideelsewhere, but come into the area during the day for months or years. Futureincreases in population in the area are not considered. Thus the methodmay underestimate the population exposed for some part of a lifetime. Onthe other hand, the method overestimates exposure for those who residein the area fewer than 70 years or who leave the area for substantial partsof the day.By these few examples, it can be seen that one can generally discuss andjudge over- or underestimation in particular estimates, but not usuallycollect enough data to quantify uncertainty. Questions relevant to two-stepdecisionmaking under the <T3>Vinyl Chloride</T3> opinion are: At which step or steps should uncertaintybe accounted for? How should uncertainty be considered if it cannot bequantified?<ITAG tagnum="81">Graphical Method of Combining Maximum Individual Risk and Incidence</ITAG>There are graphical ways to show individual risk and incidence conceptstogether, and one of these is explained here. Comment is requested on theuse of such a method of considering these risk measures. Although specificmaximum individual lifetime risks and incidences are shown on the figures,these are illustrative examples only.Figure V-1 is a simple plot of individual risk on the y axis and the populationsize on the x axis. The plotted lines are 1 andmultiply; 10^4 and 1 andmultiply;10^6 maximum individual lifetime risk. Figure V-2 shows the plot of thecombinations of maximum individual lifetime risk and population size thatcorrespond to an incidence of 1 cancer case per year. Figure V-3 showsthe maximum individual lifetime risk and incidence lines together, andFigure V-4 adds shading in the area of the graph that contains all pointsmeeting a hypothetical requirement that no person be at greater than 1andmultiply; 10^4 maximum individual lifetime risk and that the entire populationrisk be at less than 1 added cancer case per year.The graphical approach can be used to plot the data from a risk distribution(such as that in Table V-1A shown in the discussion of Approach A). OnFigure V-5, distributions are plotted for risk from four hypothetical sources.By examining where parts of a line fall with respect to selected maximumindividual lifetime risk and incidence parameters, one can see how manypeople are at risks lower than any maximum individual lifetime risk orinterest or whether a particular incidence is exceeded. It is also possibleto see whether a risk distribution is skirting the edge of being aboveany acceptable risk line or is well under it. This allows considerationof whether to try to narrow uncertainties in the risk assessment.Graphs such as these could be used to make regulatory decisions and communicateabout them. Comment is requested.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M005</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 2 65-69</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>Technology Availability and Plant Closure Considerations  In previous NESHAP decisions, EPA has given primary consideration to theobjective of reducing risks to public health. However, in evaluating alternativeregulatory options, EPA has also considered the extent to which plantswould be forced to: (a) Install control technologies which are not costeffective or fully demonstrated and/or (b) curtail or stop production.These considerations are reflected in today's proposal to the extent thatthey apply to affected benzene sources. However, these sources do not representthe full range of circumstances that exist among other source categorieswhich will be affected by NESHAP decisions. For example, in other sourcecategories control technology may be less effective, or costs may be greater;the financial strength of the industries may be greater or less; the abilityto pass through control costs may be greater; and/or the ability to usenonhazardous materials to produce the same products may exist. The EPAis today soliciting public comment on several specific issues relatingto technology availability and plant closure issues both in the contextof today's proposal and in the broader context of future NESHAP decisions. With regard to the availability of technology to control air pollutants,EPA has typically considered a technology available if it has been installedon a commercial scale in the U.S. and adequate data have been collectedon plant and control equipment characteristics and performance. However,at various times in the past, and in the present proposal, EPA has consideredemission standards which force plants to install technologies which donot meet these current ``availability'' criteria or curtail productionor shutdown. For example, EPA has in the past considered a technology ``available''if it has been commercially demonstrated in other countries, even if nounits have been installed in the U.S. Also, EPA has considered bench- orpilot-scale demonstrations in order to judge reasonableness of expendituresfor commercial demonstration of a given technology. Some have argued thatpotentially superior, costlier, but commercially undemonstrated technologieswill not be installed in the absence of regulatory requirements to do so.Others have argued that EPA should not be concerned about the extent towhich technologies are ``available'' since the standards should be solelybased on public health considerations. Proponents of this latter view arguethat the health-based standards will themselves provide adequate incentivefor currently high risk industries to develop new control technologies.Still others argue that the compliance schedules in section 112 will causesources to close rather than undertake the risk of installing costly technologythat is uproven.  The EPA solicits public comment on the relative merits of alternative criteriafor determining the availability of technology, and on the question ofappropriate alternative methods for encouraging development of alternativetechnologies, processes, product substitutes, and/or lifestyle changes. In regard to plant closure issues, EPA today solicits public comment onseveral specific issues relating to the procedures used to estimate plantclosures:  1. <T3>Compliance cost estimation. </T3>It is reasonable to assume that plantswould engage in cost mitigation strategies, such as production factor substitution,common ducting of emission streams, or exploitation of available controlequipment capacity. In contrast, conditions such as age or type of equipmentat other individual plants may result in above average control costs. Howshould EPA incorporate such plant-specific considerations in estimationsof the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements?  2. <T3>Price effect estimation. </T3>In assessing economic impacts, EPA usesavailable data to assess the extent to which compliance costs may be passedthrough to consumers. Do the EPA's current approaches adequately considerthe extent to which the use of substitute products, production inputs,or price effect mitigation strategies modifies the economic impact of newregulatory requirements? How should EPA consider uncertainties in theseand other market factors which affect the impact of new regulations?  3. <T3>Projection of demand effects and plant closures. </T3>The EPA typicallyprojects the proportion of existing domestic production plants which wouldclose by examining the availability of technology the meet the standard.Where technology is available, EPA examines and projects changes in totaldemand for products or production inputs by considering supply cost functionsof existing domestic plants, new domestic plants, and foreign sources.Are the EPA's current procedures for estimating plant closures resultingfrom predicted price and quantity effects reasonable?  4. <T3>Employment effect estimation. </T3>The Agency has presented informationpreviously that predicts the direct employment effects of closures in thebenzene source categories considered in this rule. Generally, these resultshave been derived from studies that assess the technological feasibilityof control and, for Approach A, economic factors that may force closures.Further, the Agency has not calculated the secondary employment impactsfrom shutdowns (so called ``multiplier effects'') for any of the approachesand the employment effects of closures of plants using or producing benzeneproducts.  In light of the above, the Agency is interested in whether there are methodologiesthat are available to calculate these secondary employment effects. Inaddition, what are the likely consequences of closures of plants usingor producing benzene products?  5. <T3>Balancing of costs and risk reduction benefits. </T3>Generally, asair pollution control equipment becomes more efficient the cost of eachadditional increment of control becomes increasingly great. Thus, the incrementalhealth benefits associated with each additional increment of control oftenbecome smaller while costs become greater. In determining an ample marginof safety, how should EPA determine at what point the cost of further controloutweighs the additional health benefit?.  The EPA also solicits public comment on the appropriate treatment of plantclosure risk in the post-<T3>Vinyl Chloride </T3>regulatory framework. For example, is it reasonable,as a general principle, to establish regulatory requirements which compelindividual high-risk sources to either install less-than-fully demonstratedcontrol technologies or curtail operations? For the particular benzenestandards proposed in today's <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, is it likely that plant closures or productioncutbacks would be required to meet the standards? What are the potentialconsequences of domestic plant closures? Would foregone production fromexisting U.S. plants be made up through increased production from new U.S.plants which comply with the new regulatory requirements as opposed toincreased imports?Description of Alternative Policy ApproachesEach of the four approaches described here for comment approaches the ``acceptablerisk'' decision differently. The first approach considers all risk factorsin the acceptable decision and all risk factors plus cost and feasibilityof emission controls in the ample margin of safety decision. The otherthree approaches differ from the first in that they use a single parameter,maximum individual lifetime risk or incidence, as the sole deciding factorfor acceptable risk, while considering other factors in the ``ample margin''step.The case-by-case and single parameter approaches differ in the degree towhich they possess each of two desirable features. One feature is the abilityof the Agency to consider the weight of evidence, or confidence, in thehazard data from which risk numbers are derived, and the confidence inthe emission and exposure estimates. The second feature is the degree towhich decisions are clear and understandable, and thus can be perceivedby the public as consistent.The case-by-case approach is designed to bring all of the evidence to bearin association with risk numbers at both decision steps. The Agency hasadopted the policy of risk assessment contained in the 1983 study by theNational Academy of Sciences entitled ``Risk Assessment in the FederalGovernment: Managing the Process,'' National Academy Press. This studycovers the various elements of cancer risk assessment and the assumptionsand uncertainties it involves. One of the policies emphasized in the reportand adopted by EPA is to give the risk manager a risk characterizationwhich contains the information needed for a decision on how much confidenceto place on numbers. For example, numbers for risk estimates for two differentpollutants might look the same, but be based on data sets of quite differentquality. A very large set of data from human and animal studies could bethe foundation for a high degree of confidence in deriving a quantitativedose/response relationship. On the other hand, a quantitative dose/responseestimate based on less evidence could be more uncertain. Moreover, emissionestimates and exposure modeling may be based on site-specific information,assumptions, or combinations of the two. Depending on the data and assumptions,there can be large differences in the confidence of the exposure estimates.A risk manager would be justified in using the two kinds of estimates differentlyin decisionmaking, in spite of the fact that the numbers might be verysimilar. An advantage of the case-by-case approach is that it is designedto use the full range of evidence behind the risk numbers in determiningacceptable risk and in deciding on an ample margin of safety. A disadvantageof this approach is that it is reliant on case-by-case interpretation andjudgment of data, which makes the basis for decision difficult for thepublic to understand, and decisions may appear inconsistent when differentnumerical risks are judged to be acceptable in different cases.The single measure approaches tend to take risk numbers at face value forthe acceptable risk decision, with a fuller consideration of the weightof all evidence at the margin of safety step. The advantages of these approachesare their clarity and ease of administration, which are good bases foradoption of such an approach. Their disadvantage is that they do not considerall of the risk factors, risk characterization, and uncertainties in theinitial step. The Agency would weigh all of the evidence in final decisionsunder any of the approaches.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach A. Case-by-Case Approach</ITAG>In this approach individual risk, risk distribution, and incidence andtheir estimation limitations and uncertainties are all considered in determiningwhat is an acceptable risk. The acceptability of an individual risk levelis judged as a function of the number of persons at that level and theassociated incidence for the exposed population. Judgment on an acceptabletotal incidence includes consideration of how much of the incidence isassociated with higher or lower individual risk.In applying Approach A, the approach is to examine the risk distributionand to consider maximum individual risks around 10^4 or less to be thepreferred range. The 10^4 level was selected for reasons analogous to itsuse in Approach C (see discussion of Approach C for further explanation).Under all Approach A decisions, however, the Agency will closely examinethe aggravating and mitigating factors associated with the risk estimates.Included in this examination is recognition that there are considerableuncertainties in the risk characterization, emission estimates, and exposureassumptions; these uncertainties may vary widely among assessment. Acceptabilityof higher risks includes consideration of the number of people at thatrisk and the total incidence. Greater weight is given to the incidenceassociated with individual risks greater than 10^5; this is because riskslower than this are generally considered small. In addition, both the dose/responseand exposure estimates increase in uncertainty at these lower levels, whichgenerally represent large extrapolations from high to low doses and dispersionof the pollutant at greater distance from the source, respectively. Risksgreater than the 10^4 or less preferred range may be judged acceptablein this approach when all factors are considered. Examples of circumstancesthat EPA believes appropriate to consider include: (1) the uncertaintiesof the analysis; (2) the degree of over or underestimation in the riskcharacterization; (3) the weight of evidence of the health effects andnon-quantified health effects; (4) modeled versus measured exposures; and(5) the estimated population predicted at lifetime risk of around 1 in10,000 or greater.Table V-1A shows the risks proposed as acceptable under Approach A fortwo benzene source categories: Equipment leaks and coke by-product recoveryplants. The findings are more completely discussed in later sections ofthis notice. In considering the risk parameters for the acceptable riskdecision the fact that most of the incidence was associated with lowerrange individual risks was balanced against the fact that the maximum individuallifetime risks were higher than the preferred range of around 10^4 or less.The overall risk distributions shown in Table V-1A were considered acceptablewhen all factors and their estimation uncertainties were weighed.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 278</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>The uncertainty of the risk estimation is considered at both the acceptablerisk and ample margin of safety steps. For both source categories the uncertaintyof the dose/response estimate for benzene was considered. In general, thedata set on benzene is one of the better ones available on any chemicalcarcinogen. Benzene is classified as a human carcinogen and judgment thatthe quantitative dose/response estimate, derived from studies on humans,for leukemia might be on the high side, but still plausible, was balancedby consideration of the fact that other types of malignancy have been observedin human studies. Because these effects were not quantifiable from theavailable data, uncertainty existed about whether all of the cancer riskhad been accounted for. On the exposure from both source categories, forseveral reasons described in later sections, the existing emission estimateswere considered to be upperbound estimates.For the proposed ample margin of safety decision the risk parameters wereagain considered along with the cost and feasibility of risk reduction.The costs and technical factors differ greatly among the categories andare discussed in detail in later sections. As shown in Table V-1B, thesedecisions result in similar after-regulation risk distributions for thetwo categories, equipment leaks and coke by-product recovery plants, withvery low incidence associated with individual risks above 10^4 or 10^5.At both steps, uncertainty is given weight and the risk parameters areconsidered together.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration 280</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Approach B. Incidence-Based Approach</ITAG>In this approach, incidence is proposed to be the only parameter used todecide acceptability of risk. At the ample margin of safety step, all ofthe risk parameters as well as estimation uncertainties, cost, and feasibilitywould be considered. The annual incidence proposed as acceptable wouldbe 1 case/yr. Thus, under Approach B all NESHAP would be set to resultin no greater than 1 case/yr for a source category, as a whole. The EPAis proposing an incidence number of 1 because it is small in relation tothe millions of persons exposed to benzene, and in relation to the incidenceassociated with risks from numerous everyday activities. Comment is requestedon the appropriateness of this criterion or another number.Approach B would rely upon incidence for several reasons. First, incidencereflects the overall ``public health'' concerns toward which section 112is directed. As noted above, most of the members of the public who areexposed to emissions, and therefore most of the incidence associated withthose emissions, is associated with individuals exposed to levels lowerthan the individuals who receive the maximum exposure. Moreover, althoughboth incidence and maximum individual lifetime risk are highly uncertainfigures, in general incidence figures are more likely to be accurate thanmaximum individual lifetime risk figures. A maximum individual life timerisk estimate is much more sensitive to errors in modeling assumptionsin the exposure estimate. When those uncertainties are spread throughoutthe exposed population in an incidence estimate, they tend to average out,and thus to yield results closer to ``true'' risk. For example, the incidencewould be the same as long as the residence is occupied during the 70-yearperiod, regardless by which persons. That is, the incidence would be thesame if the same person lived at the residence for 70 years as it wouldbe if 10 different persons lived at the residence during this time.Figure V-6 is a graph with the log of individual risk on the y axis andlog of annual incidence on the x axis. The lines entered on the graph correspondto the 1 case per year incidence of Approach B and the 1andmultiply;10^4and 1andmultiply;10^6 maximum individual risks of Approaches C and D. Thepoints entered on the graph are the intersection points of maximum individualrisk and incidence numbers estimated for risks from the source categorieslisted in the key. (<T3>Note: </T3>Numbers given in this discussion for radiation risk arefor fatal tumors). The figure indicates that, of the baseline risks shownthere for benzene source categories, those for benzene from coke by-productrecovery plants would be at greater than 1 case/yr. The associated maximumindividual risk would be 10^3. The acceptable risk decisions for coke by-productrecovery plants differ significantly under policy Approaches A and B sincethe baseline risk would be acceptable under A, but not B. The ample marginof safety decision under Approach B would parallel that under ApproachA in method. The annual incidence of less than 1 case/yr is, of course,the starting point for ample margin decisions in Approach B. The analysiswould focus on additional reductions in incidence as well as for the otherrisk parameters, considering cost, feasibility, and other relevant factors.For the benzene source categories, the regulatory outcome would be thesame under both approaches. These results are discussed in Sections VIIthrough X. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration 283</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>Features to note about Approach B include the fact that since maximum individualrisks plays no role in the acceptable risk decision, high maximum individualrisk levels would be acceptable so long as the exposed population is sufficientlysmall that the incidence level is met (see Figure V-6). Another point tonote is that the size of the incidence number may be due largely to exposureof a very large population to a small individual risk. For example, seeTable V-1A. This makes the acceptable risk decision dependent to a greatdegree on estimates of exposure to the least exposed individual furthestfrom the source. As previously mentioned, the dose/response and exposureestimates increase in uncertainty at these low levels which generally representlarge extrapolations from high to low dose and dispersion of the pollutantat greater distance from the source, respectively. Deficiencies of usingonly one risk measure in the first decision could be addressed in the ``amplemargin'' decision. For example, when using only incidence gives slightattention to circumstances in which a small population may be at high individualrisk, EPA could consider action to impart a margin of safety for the smallpopulation. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach C. 1andmultiply;10</ITAG>^4 or less Maximum Individual RiskApproachThis approach would use maximum individual risk as the sole parameter fordeciding acceptable risk. At the ample margin of safety step the risk distributionand incidence would be added to the factors considered as well as uncertainty,cost and feasibility. The acceptable risk level for maximum individual risk under this approachis 1andmultiply;10^4 or less. This level is analogous to the top of the targetindividual risk range used in some other EPA programs. This target rangehas evolved through a history of decisionmaking under the structure ofother statutes. However, the decisionmaking structures under the statutesgoverning those programs are quite different, so comparison is imperfect.And, typically the target range there is for post-control risks, whilehere it would be the first step of the decisionmaking process. Additionally,the 10^4 risk level falls roughly into the middle of the risk range developedin the survey of risks, discussed earlier in this section. For benzene, the regulatory outcome for the coke by-product and equipmentleak source categories would be greater control than under either ApproachA or B. Neither of the two categories would be at an acceptable risk levelprior to regulation, and each would require control beyond the NESHAP proposedunder previous approaches in order to be at 1andmultiply;10^4 maximum individualrisk or less. The result for benzene storage vessels and EB/S process ventswould be the same under all three approaches. This approach and Approach D would put great weight on the estimation ofthe maximum concentration to which anyone could be exposed, which is theexposure element of the maximum individual risk. Without the additionalperspective of the risk distribution and incidence estimates and all otherrisk information, many decisions would ride exclusively on the highly uncertainprediction of the concentration and location of the area of maximum exposure.The accuracy of emission factors, meteorological data, and census datafor specific source locations are among the more uncertain estimates, butwould be the most critical elements under this decision. However, at the ample margin of safety step, the other risk measures couldbe examined to bring the needed perspective to the overall decision. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach D. 1andmultiply;10</ITAG>^4 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproachThis approach is identical to Approach C except that it uses a more stringentcriterion for individual risk. The acceptable risk is defined as 1andmultiply;10^\6\maximum individual risk. One reason why this level might be selected isthat the risk below this level have been generally regarded as negligibleadditions to an individual lifetime risk of cancer. Additionally, the 10^\6\level falls at the lower end of the risk range in the survey of risks,discussed earlier in this section. Each of the benzene source categories would require additional controlto reduce risks to an acceptable level meeting the acceptable risks whichis also an ample margin of safety level for these categories. Requirementswould entail maximum control and cessation of operation for some or allfacilities in each category as later described. Comparison of Effects of Policy Approaches on Pending NESHAPCosts and feasibility cannot be considered at the acceptable risk stage,under <T3>Vinyl Chloride. </T3>However, as in other programs, such as settingNational Ambient Air Quality Standards under CAA section 109, EPA willprovide information to the public about broader implications of ApproachesB, C, and D. The EPA views such information to be similar to that providedin an analysis under Executive Order 12291, or an environmental impactstatement, but which is not considered as part of the statutory basis fordecisionmaking. This section outlines questions about the feasibility ofmeeting such requirements in future NESHAP. It is apparent from analyzingthe impact of various measures of acceptability on benzene source categoriesthat such questions arise. Because Approach A uses balancing of the three risk parameters and allother relevent risk information, as well as risk estimation limitationsand uncertainties, it requires a separate judgment in each case. As a result,it is not susceptible of simple comparisons of effects on source categoriesof various pollutants. In contrast, Approaches B, C, and D use a singlerisk parameter as the criterion for acceptable risk, and their effectscan be more easily compared among the baseline risk for other pollutants.For Approach B, Figure V-6 indicates that, of the baseline risks shownthere for other than benzene categories, those for coke oven emissions,radionuclides from coal-fired boilers, chromium from comfort cooling towers,and active uranium mill tailings would be at greater than 1 case/yr. Theassociated maximum individual risks range from 10^6 to over 10^2. The highestindividual risks that would be left (because associated incidence is lessthan 1 case/yr) would be between 10^3 and 10^2 for four source categories.For the coke oven emissions category, current estimates indicate that inorder to reduce annual incidence to less than 1 case/yr, all sources wouldhave to meet the most stringent level of emission control being achievedby any currently operating coke oven, or otherwise comply with a maximumemissions cap. Some source closures and/or shutdowns of large proportionsof some existing batteries would be likely. Overall, even applying presenttechnology at all sources might not achieve the emission levels neededto meet the incidence criterion within the 2-year NESHAP compliance period.New technology for control of existing coke ovens, or alternative technologiesfor producing coke would likely be necessary, or, alternatively, importedcoke would be used.The incidence associated with emissions of radionuclides from coal-firedboilers comes from about 200,000,000 people being within 50 km of the 50,000sources while exposed at individual risk below 1andmultiply;10^6. Whetherit is feasible, considering costs, to achieve less than 1 annual incidencefor this source category is presently unknown. Currently existing requirementsfor disposal of uranium tailings will achieve an acceptable incidence levelfor emissions of radionuclides. With few exceptions, active mill tailingsfacilities could only achieve an annual incidence less than 1 by closing,and by going to disposal. Chromium from comfort cooling towers is proposed to be regulated underthe TSCA. For Approach C, Figure V-6 shows that five of the source categories arewithin the acceptable range. The incidence associated with the categoriesabove the line ranges from roughly 1 per 1,000 years to about 100 per year.Any category above the line would have to be controlled to achieve a levelbelow the acceptable risk criterion. Table V-2 shows the likelihood of several important source categories beingable to meet this acceptable risk requirement. Table V-2 include roughestimates of the number of plants that would permanently shut down, andcoke production cutbacks for coke by-product recovery plants. Althoughthe underlying assumptions vary somewhat for the different categories,all of the estimates shown under Approaches C and D are based on the technologicallimits of the controls known to EPA. These estimates are not derived fromeconomic analyses. More detail on the benzene source categories can befound in Sections VII through X. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 2-89</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>Additional perspective on the question of what proportion of source categorieswould or would not be at or below 1 andmultiply; 10andCx.11;4 maximum individualrisk prior to regulation is gained from EPA preliminary risk assessmentresults on 1,878 sources of 19 carcinogens. About two-thirds of the sourceswere estimated to present risk at or below 1 andmultiply; 10andCx.11;4, andwould therefore meet this acceptable risk requirement. A 90 percent reductionin emissions is taken to correspond to a 10-fold reduction in maximum individualrisk. Thus, a reduction from 1 andmultiply; 10andCx.11;2 to 1 andmultiply; 10andCx.11;4would require a 99 percent reduction in emissions. If it is assumed thatthe greatest impact of this 10andCx.11;4 acceptable risk level is on sourcesthat would have to reduce emissions by 99 percent or more, then about 10percent of the 1,878 sources would be in the group of greater impact.Approach D would operate much like Approach C. However, the effect of havinga 1 andmultiply; 10andCx.11;6 maximum individual risk ``ceiling'' on all toxicrisk would be to impose significant additional requirements beyond thoseof any previous approach. First, many decisions not to regulate, or notto enter source categories into the Agency's ongoing risk assessment programwould have to be reexamined. The surveyed assessment results discussedabove indicate that approximately 85 percent of the 1,878 sources coveredwould be above 1 andmultiply; 10andCx.11;6 prior to regulation. About 40 percentwould have to reduce emissions by 99 percent or more. Virtually every sourceof radionuclides or radon would require action. The specific impacts andcosts cannot be projected accurately at this time, but would likely bemeasured in billions of dollars. A comparison with natural background radiationlevels will give an idea of the extent of control that would be needed.A 1 andmultiply; 10andCx.11;6 lifetime risk would compare with:1. For radionuclides other than radon_0.03 percent of annual natural backgrounddoes.2. For radon_0.01 percent of annual natural background dose from outdoorair.To achieve this level of control, underground uranium mines would likelyhave to be closed and sealed. Uranium tailings piles would have to be covered;however, the practice of using soil and rock as cover would not be sufficientfor some of the largest piles since average soil contains enough radiumso that the amount needed to keep radon from escaping the tailings woulditself generate enough radon to exceed the 1 andmultiply; 10andCx.11;6 maximumindividual risk ceiling. Many processors and users of radioactive materialswould have to control to virtually no emissions. The cost and feasibilityof meeting the requirements can only be roughly estimated at this time,but may be assumed to impose significant burdens.Table V-2 shows the effects of Approach D on the source categories on whicheffects were shown for other approaches. Because Approach D would requirethe most significant emission reductions, it would have the greatest impact.However, under each of the approaches there would be a potential of productioncurtailment or closure of some or many sources.As noted earlier, the criteria and method of decisionmaking for the amplemargin of safety step would be the same for all approaches. Because thedecision involves a judgment based on concurrent consideration of numerousfactors, the potential outcomes cannot be discussed simply here. The Agencyrequests comments on how the various risk, technical, cost, economic, anduncertainty considerations should be balanced in the decision process forthe ample margin of safety.General Discussion on Format of Standards Which Have No Technology BasisFor some source categories, the acceptable risk and/or ample margin ofsafety decisions can result in the necessity of risk and emission reductionsbeyond what is achievable with any known technology. This situation occursunder Approach C for equipment leaks and coke by-product plants and ApproachD for all benzene source categories. Examples of potential formats forexpressing such standards are emission limits that would apply to wholefacilities, emission limits with risk-based waivers, or actual risk formats.The various formats are discussed under Approach D in Section VII of thisnotice. Selection of one of these formats requires the Agency to considerwhether to allow sources to comply with risk targets using site-by-siteanalyses or whether to require compliance with a national emission limitstandard. For today's benzene proposals the emission limit format was used.Comment is requested on this format as well as any alternative formats.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI Maleic Anhydride Process Vents</ITAG>Since proposal of the standard for maleic anhydride plants in 1980, theindustry has consistently and voluntarily switched to the more economicaln-butane feed process. Since the publication of the denial of petitionfor reconsideration, the one facility using benzene feed in the productionof maleic anhydride has ceased to produce maleic anhydride (Docket No.OAQPS 79-3, Part II, Docket Item VIII-A-9). All benzene exposure due tothis industry, and therefore, all risk from benzene, has been eliminated.Thus, the questions of acceptable risk and ample margin of safety are moot,and no Federal action is warranted.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Ethylbenzene/Styrene Process Vents</ITAG>Source Category OverviewIn 1985, there were 13 plants manufacturing ethylbenzene, styrene, or both.These facilities emitted benzene from process vents, including emergencyrelease vents. Benzene emissions from equipment leaks at these plants wereregulated under the benzene equipment leak standard (40 CFR Part 61, SubpartJ).Estimation Methods and UncertaintiesIn analysis of the EB/S source category, as with the other sources of benzeneemissions, emission estimates were used in calculating leukemia risk. Thissection discusses how benzene emissions and the associated health riskswere calculated for EB/S process vents and the uncertainties associatedwith these estimates.Benzene emission estimates from EB/S process vents considered in today'snotice were based on emissions from the 13 EB/S plants operating in 1985.Benzene emissions from the process vents at these facilities totaled anestimated 155 Mg/yr.The EPA developed plant-specific estimates of emissions from EB/S processvents using data on emissions and control practices requested by the Agencyunder the authority of section 114 of the CAA and provided by the sources.These emission estimates were calculated using detailed vent-by-vent informationthat was based on measurements and site-specific engineering calculations(Docket No. A-79-49, Docket Items IV-D-13, IV-D-34, IV-D-35, and IV-D-36).At plants where control was already in place, the estimate relfects atleast 98-percent control efficiency from boilers, flares and incinerators,and facility-specific efficiencies for product recovery. Using this methodology,EPA estimated total emissions to be 208Mg/yr. This estimate was used incalculating the risk estimates previously presented in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice on denial of the petition for reconsideration.However, the Agency also presented a revised benzene emission estimateof 155 Mg/yr in the same notice. The revision was based on data suppliedby CMA and reflected changes in emissions at 3 of the 13 plants (DocketNo. A-79-49, Docket Item IV-F-2, VI-D-2). These changes included the additionof controls and process modifications. The fact that this total of 155Mg/yr is based on site-specific measurements or engineering calculationsat the 13 individual plants gives the Agency a high degree of confidencein this estimate of emissions from EB/S process vents in 1985.To estimate leukemia risks attributable to benzene emissions from EB/Sprocess vents nationwide, the EPA's Industrial Source Complex (ISC) dispersionmodel was used to predict ambient benzene concentrations, and the HEM wasused to estimate population exposure to the concentrations and predictleukemia risk. Population exposure was modeled out to 20 km from each ofthe 13 sources. The ISC dispersion model was run using plant-specific datafrom the 13 plants for the case where total emissions were 208 Mg/yr. Therisk estimates presented in today's notice were calculated by proportionaladjustment of the risk estimates generated using ISC and HEM to accountfor changes in emissions at the three plants mentioned above.The uncertainties associated with the ambient concentration estimates fromthe ISC and the exposure estimates from the HEM are typical of the generaluncertainties associated with exposure modeling discussed in Section VI.Risk CharacterizationAs discussed in Section V, the first step in making NESHAP decisions isdetermination of an acceptable risk level. In deciding what level of riskis acceptable for EB/S process vents under the four approaches, the Administratorconsidered the range of levels shown on Table VII-1. The levels representexample scenarios to show how different emission levels would result indifferent health risk profiles. Implicit in the range considered is theemission level of zero, not only for this source category, but also forthe subsequent source categories discussed in this notice. The table presentsthe risk estimates at baseline in terms of estimated annual leukemia incidence,maximum individual lifetime risk, total population exposed at or aboveparticular risk levels (i.e., risk distribution), and annual incidenceattributable to the population exposed at each risk level. All risk estimatesfor this and the subsequent source categories discussed in this noticehave been presented to one significant figure. The baseline level representsthe emissions as of 1985 with no Federal standard (i.e., the emission levelof 155 Mg/yr). The table also presents available estimates of annual incidenceand maximum individual lifetime risk for a lower emission level identifiedas Emission Level A.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">insert illustration 296</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG><T3>Application of Alternative Policy Approaches</T3>The decisions that would result from application on each of the four policyapproaches, described in Section V, to the EB/S process vents source categoryare presented below. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach A. Case-by-Case Approach</ITAG><T3>Decision on Acceptable Risk.</T3> The estimated maximum individuallifetime risk of EB/S process vents is 2 andmultiply; 10^5 at baseline. (Thisis the increased risk of contracting cancer if an individual were exposedcontinuously to the maximum modeled annual average concentration of 0.8ppb for 70 years). This estimate is within the range generally consideredto be preferred under the case-by-case approach. The annual incidence atthe baseline is estimated to be 0.004 leukemia case/yr, which is consideredto be small. In addition, as the table shows, only 0.0002 case/yr is associatedwith lifetime risk levels of 1 andmultiply; 10^5 or higher. Most of the incidenceis associated with the large population exposed to predicted lifetime risksin the 10^6 range or lower. As noted in Section V, incidence estimatesat the 10^6 and lower risk levels are given less weight under this approachbecause they are generally considered to be small and the uncertainty inthe risk estimates increases at these lower levels. The modeled maximumbenzene concentration from EB/S emissions in 0.8 ppb, which is close tothe estimated average rural background exposure, but most of the populationis exposed to lower concentrations from EB/S emissions. Based on consideration of the preceding factors, the health impacts atthe baseline benzene emission level from EB/S process vents are consideredacceptable under the case-by-case approach. <T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety.</T3> In determining an ample marginof safety under all four policy approaches, and for any source category,factors such as model uncertainties, available controls and the risk reductionsthey would achieve, the cost effectiveness of emission and risk reductions,and other relevant factors are considered. For EB/S process vents, the estimates of annual incidence and maximum individuallifetime risk at the baseline emission level are quite low. Moreover, themajority (75 percent) of the incidence is associated with lifetime risklevels of less than 1 andmultiply; 10^6. A very small additional reductionin risk achievable by control of the few remaining uncontrolled intermittentemission sources using 98-percent efficient combustion devices (e.g., boilersand flares). Control of these sources would further reduce benzene emissionsby approximately 100 Mg/yr. Such additional control measures could reducethe estimated maximum individual lifetime risk from 2 andmultiply; 10^5 to1 andmultiply; 10^5 and could reduce the annual incidence by 0.003 case/yr.The estimated cost of this additional control is relatively low, about$200,000/yr (1982$). The baseline risks are considered under this approach to provide an amplemargin of safety given that the majority of the low baseline risk is associatedwith exposure at lifetime risks of less than 1 andmultiply; 10^6. Additionalcontrol is not warranted because the costs are disproportionately highwhen compared to the small reductions in risk which would be achieved.Present controls in the EB/S industry are in the form of product recoverydevices or by routing emissions to the process unit's boilers to conserveenergy (less fuel would be required due to the energy content of the wastestream). Thus, there is no incentive for removal of existing controls.Additionally, there is no incentive for new sources to waste product orenergy and major new sources would be subject to other EPA requirements(e.g., new source review, prevention of significant deterioration). Thus,less effective controls are not expected in the future. For these reasons,no standard mandating the present control level is proposed under ApproachA. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach B. Incidence-Based Approach </ITAG><T3>Decision on Acceptable Risk.</T3> Total annual incidence from benzeneemissions from EB/S process vents is estimated to be 0.004 case/yr, or1 case every 250 years. Under the criteria of the incidence-based approach,the baseline level of risk for EB/S process vents would clearly be acceptable.<T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>For EB/S process vents, theestimates of annual incidence and maximum individual risk are low. Themaximum modeled annual average benzene concentration is 0.8 ppb, whichis comparable to rural background levels. Most of the population is exposedto much lower concentrations from EB/S process vents. The baseline level of emissions reflects the fact that most EB/S processvents already have emission control equipment. Control of the remaininguncontrolled intermittent emission sources would further reduce benzeneemissions by approximately 100 Mg/yr. Estimated annual incidence wouldbe reduced by 0.003 case/yr, leaving a residual incidence of 0.001 case/yr.The majority of the baseline incidence is associated with the populationat lifetime risk levels below 1 andmultiply; 10^6, and most of the incidencereduction is associated with the population exposed to these low risk levels.The estimated cost of this additional control is estimated to be about$200,000/yr (1982$). Under the incidence-based approach, the baseline incidence is consideredto provide an ample margin of safety. Factors considered in this determinationinclude the fact that the population is exposed to very low risk levelsat baseline and the disproportionate cost of control relative to the smallrisk reduction which could be achieved. Furthermore, for reasons statedin the discussion of Approach A, EPA would not propose a standard to mandatethe present level of control under this approach. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach C. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^4 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproach <T3>Decision on Acceptable Risk.</T3> As shown in Table VII-1, the maximumindividual lifetime risk at baseline is estimated to be 2 andmultiply; 10^5.As previously discussed, this risk level is associated with exposures toan annual average concentration of 0.8 ppb continuously for a period of70 years. Under the criterion of this approach, which requires target maximum individualsrisks in the range of 1 andmultiply; 10^4 or less, the baseline risks wouldbe judged acceptable. <T3>Decision of Ample Margin of Safety.</T3> For EB/S process vents, theestimates of annual incidence and maximum individual risks are low. Thepredicted baseline maximum individual risk of 2 andmultiply; 10^5 is withinthe target range for Approach C, and is well below the 1 andmultiply; 10^4level. As described in the discussions of Approaches A and B, the majorityof the population exposed to emissions from EB/S process vents are exposedto risk levels below 1 andmultiply; 10^6. Only a small reduction in riskswould be achievable using known control techniques. Maximum individualrisks would be reduced from a baseline level of 2 andmultiply; 10^5 to alevel of 1 andmultiply; 10^5 by applying these controls, and incidence wouldbe reduced by 0.003 case/yr. Considering the above factors, the baseline emission level would be judgedto provide an ample margin of safety under policy Approach C. Furthermore,for reasons discussed in the section on Approach A, EPA would not proposea standard to mandate the present level of control.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach D. 1andmultiply;10</ITAG>^6 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproach<T3>Decision on Acceptable Risk. </T3>At baseline, the estimated maximumindividual lifetime risk is 2andmultiply;10^5, and maximum risks for 6 ofthe 13 facilities exceed the Approach D target maximum risk level of 1andmultiply;10^6.Therefore, under Approach D, the baseline risks would be judged unacceptable,and EPA would propose standards to reduce maximum individual risks to ator below 1andmultiply;10^6.<T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>For the facilities with baselinemaximum individual risks above 1andmultiply;10^6, EPA cannot identify controltechnologies that would achieve risk levels of 1andmultiply;10^6 or lower.As previously noted, application of the additional feasible control touncontrolled intermittent emission sources would result in an estimatedmaximum risk of 1andmultiply;10^5, which exceeds the target level of ApproachD of 1andmultiply;10^6. Thus, the only types of standards that could be proposedto reduce maximum individual risk to below 1andmultiply;10^6 for all facilitieswould be emission limits, emission limits with risk-based waiver provisions,or risk-based limits. These limits would apply to the total combined benzeneemissions from all process vents at an EB/S facility.Under an emission limit format, total emissions from all facilities wouldbe required to be below a given level. The level would be computed to ensurethat no facility would cause maximum risks above 1andmultiply;10^6. However,since risk estimates will vary even for facilities with the same emissionrate depending on dispersion characteristics (e.g., stack height, exitvelocity, and flue gas temperature), meteorology, and population patterns,some facilities complying with the emission limit could have maximum individualrisks well below 1andmultiply;10^6.Under an emission limit with a risk-based waiver, a facility would be permitteda waiver from the emission limit if it could demonstrate that because ofemission source dispersion characteristics, meteorology, or populationpatterns (in the case in which maximum risk were determined with referenceto actual residences), the generally applicable emission limits resultedin maximum individual risks lower than 1andmultiply;10^6.If a risk-based limit were chosen, each facility would have to reduce emissionsto achieve estimated maximum individual risks of 1andmultiply;10^6 or lower.Under this format, as well as the emission limit with risk-based waiverformat, emission rates would be allowed to vary among facilities. The emissionreduction required for each facility could be determined by facility-specificdispersion and exposure modeling. This alternative format could allow forland use planning in addition to emission reductions as means of achievingthe target risk level.To implement either a standard or a waiver to an emission limit that isrisk-based, EPA would have to develop guidance on acceptable methodologyfor conducting the risk modeling. This would include guidance on acceptable(1) dispersion modeling assumptions such as, meteorology and atmosphericstability; (2) characterization of the emission rate, gas exit velocityand temperature, and release height of the emission sources; (3) estimationof the population and their location in the modeled area; and (4) the radialdistances from the source for which concentrations are estimated. In addition,the Agency would have to decide whether maximum individual lifetime riskis to be determined at actual or potential sites of exposure. Even withthe models used by EPA in risk assessments, many different assumptionscan be used and these can significantly affect the estimates. Without suchguidance it would be difficult for enforcement personnel to determine ifthe modeling analysis is appropriate for demonstrating compliance or todemonstrate that a modeling analysis is unacceptable. Although guidancecan be developed from the existing models, it would require more time thanis available under the court order to define precisely the range of acceptableassumptions for site-specific analyses.For benzene, an ambient monitoring alternative to site-specific risk analysisalso cannot be used for either 1andmultiply;10^6 or 1andmultiply;10^4 standards.A 1andmultiply;10^6, or lower, standard would require the benzene concentrationfrom the source to be 0.04 ppb or lower; for a 1andmultiply;10^4 risk standard,the concentration would be 4 ppb, or lower. Since background concentrationsof benzene are typically 1 to 6 ppb, it would not be feasible to differentiatebetween a source's contribution to ambient concentrations and variationsin natural background levels or in analytical measurements. Thus, compliancewith or violation of the standards could not be demonstrated by monitoring.As with a risk-based standard or waiver, it will take considerable timeboth to develop procedures, and to review and approve demonstrations ofcompliance with an emission limit standard. Compliance with an emissionlimit is expected to require extension of available procedures to low concentrationsor development of new test methods and acceptable engineering analyses.In addition, many facilities may elect, subject to EPA approval, to conductsite-specific analyses including testing. In such cases it would be resourceintensive to industry and EPA to implement the standard. However, of thealternatives, the risk-based limit is considered to present somewhat greaterdifficulties because of the additional considerations involved.Therefore, in today's notice, to illustrate the effects of applying policyApproach D (1andmultiply;10^6 risk target), EPA has selected an emissionlimit alternative. It is anticipated that all the alternatives would bedifficult and costly to implement. However, the Agency requests commentson all alternatives.The emission limit that would ensure that no EB/S plant produces maximumindividual risks exceeding 1andmultiply;10^6 is a total emission limit of5.5 kg benzene/day (or 2 Mg/yr) from all process vents at any EB/S facility.This emission limit was calculated by determining the emission/risk ratiosfor EB/S facilities that control all process vent streams by combustionas seen in the risk modeling results and calculating the emission levelthat would correlate to a maximum risk of 1andmultiply;10^6 for facilitieswith the highest risk per unit of emissions. This calculation assumes thatrisk will be reduced in proportion to emissions.With an emission limit of 5.5 kg benzene/day, annual emissions from the13 facilities would be reduced to no more than 26 Mg/yr if all 13 facilitiescontinued to operate. Annual incidence for EB/S process vents would bereduced to about 0.0007 case/yr. No individual would be exposed to a lifetimerisk level above 1andmultiply;10^6, and the majority of the population wouldbe exposed to much lower levels. Therefore, under Approach D, this emissionlimit would also be considered to provide an ample margin of safety.Since EPA has not identified control techniques that would reduce benzeneemissions to 5.5 kg/day, the owners or operators would have to determineappropriate means of demonstrating compliance with the standard. Furthermore,the benzene concentrations in the exhaust gas that would be required tomeet this emission limit at some facilities are below detectable concentrationsusing the available EPA-approved test methods. Therefore, EPA requestscomments on how compliance would be demonstrated under this approach. Itis also unknown if plantwide emissions can be reduced to 5.5 kg/day atall facilities. Controlled process vents emissions at 8 of 13 facilitiesoperating in 1985 exceeded this limit. Because EPA does not know how thestandard might be achieved at those facilities, EPA cannot at present estimatethe costs or economic impacts of achieving this emission limit. However,it is thought that some closures might result due to technical difficultiesof achieving the emission limit. The potential economic impacts of anyclosures could include increased unemployment and the associated communityimpacts, loss of tax revenues, and price increases. The EPA also invitescomment on the economic impacts of closure.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Benzene Storage Vessels</ITAG>Source Category OverviewAs of the June 6, 1984, withdrawal of the proposed standard for benzenestorage vessels, 126 facilities with benzene storage vessels were identified.These facilities generally have multiple vessels. Benzene storage vesselsare located in petroleum refineries, chemical plants, and bulk storageterminals.Estimation Methods and Uncertainties In analysis of the benzene storage vessel source category, as with othersources of benzene emissions, emission estimates were used in calculatingleukemia risk. This section discusses how benzene emissions and the associatedhealth risks were calculated for benzene storage vessels and the uncertaintiesassociated with these estimates. Benzene emission estimates presented in this notice are based on vesselsat 126 plants, using model vessels as a basis for the estimates. The emissionestimates have not been revised or updated since the analysis for the withdrawalof the proposed standard in 1984. When developing benzene emission estimatesfor storage vessels, EPA carefully considered data from four differenttesting programs conducted by Chicago Bridge and Iron for a storage vesselvendor, EPA, and API (two test programs). These tests spanned the rangeof equipment configurations typically used on benzene storage vessels suchas various roof and seal types. The emission estimates derived from the testing programs were applied tomodel units for large and small benzene producers, benzene consumers, andbulk storage terminals. The model units were assigned to each of 126 plantswith benzene storage vessels in one or more of the above uses. Total emissionsare estimated to be between 620 and 1,290 Mg benzene per year. The lowerend of this range, 620 Mg/yr, reflects the assumption that all storagevessels have continuous seals. The upper end of the range, 1,290 Mg/yr,was based on the assumption that some vessels are equipped with shingledseals, which emit more benzene than continuous seals. The number of vesselsestimated to have shingled seals is based on a 1978 survey of benzene storagevessels. The Agency believes that the emission factor used to estimate emissionsfrom vessels with shingled seals is likely higher than the true value.The emission tests on shingled seals involved some test procedure irregularitieswhich EPA strongly believed caused emissions to be overestimated, althoughthe Agency could not quantify this overestimation. More details on thedevelopment of emission estimates from test data can be found in the WithdrawalBID. The risk of leukemia attributable to benzene emissions from benzene storagevessels was calculated based on the range of emission estimates that reflectthe assumptions about the use of continuous seals and shingled seals. Indeveloping the risk estimates, EPA ran the HEM based on the assumptionthat all model vessels had continuous seals. From these results, the estimateswere proportioned to reflect the use of shingled seals. The HEM was runfor 126 plants with exposure modeling to a 20-km radius around each plant.Industry practice is to equip new benzene storage vessels with continuousseals rather than shingled seals. Thus, over the 70-year risk estimatingperiod as existing shingled seal vessels are replaced with new continuousseal vessels, the estimated emissions and risks from storage vessels willlikely lessen. For a general discussion of risk assessment and modeling uncertainties,the reader is referred to Section IV of this preamble. Risk Characterization In deciding what level of risk is acceptable under the four approaches,the Administrator considered the range of levels presented in Table VIII-1,including, as noted previously, a zero emissions level. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 2 108 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C  </ITAG>The levels represent example scenarios to show how different emission levelswould result in different health risk profiles. The table summarizes therisks (i.e., annual incidence, maximum individual lifetime risk, risk distribution,and incidence by risk group) that were estimated for the baseline emissionlevel and a lower level shown as Emission Level A. The baseline representsthe emissions as of 1984 with no Federal standard (i.e., the emission levelranging from 620 Mg/yr to 1,290 Mg/yr). Application of Alternative Policy Approaches The decisions that would result from application of each of the four policyapproaches, described in Section V, to the benzene storage vessel sourcecategory are presented below. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach A. Case-by-Case Approach </ITAG><T3>Decision on Acceptable Risk.</T3> As shown in Table VIII-1, the estimatedmaximum individual lifetime risk at baseline ranges from 4 andmultiply; 10^5to 4 andmultiply; 10^4. (This is the increased risk of contracting cancerif an individual were exposed continuously to the maximum extrapolatedconcentration of 1 to 15 ppb for 70 years). These estimates are withinthe range generally considered to be preferred under the case-by-case approach.The lower end of this range reflects the assumption that all storage vesselshave continuous seals, while the upper end of the range is based on theassumption that all vessels at the maximum risk plant have shingled seals.The upper end of the range 4 andmultiply; 10^4) is a particularly conservativeestimate for three reasons. First, the emission estimate for shingled sealsis believed to be an overestimate. Second, the assumption that all storagevessels at the maximum risk plant have shingled seals is a worst-case assumptionand probably overestimates the risk. Third, over the assumed 70-year exposureperiod, many of the existing vessels will be replaced and the new vesselswill likely have continuous seals and, therefore, lower emissions. The estimated annual incidence ranges from 0.05 to 0.1 case/yr. The rangereflects the range of emission estimates discussed above (620 to 1,290Mg/yr). These incidence levels are considered to be relatively small. Furthermore,0.004 case/yr is associated with a lifetime risk level of 1 andmultiply;10^5 or higher. Therefore, almost all of the incidence (0.1 case/yr) isassociated with the large population exposed to lifetime risks in the 10^6range or less. As previously noted, incidence estimates at the 10^6 risklevel and lower are given less weight because they are generally consideredto be small and the uncertainty in the risk estimates increases at theselower risk levels. The annual average concentrations due to emissions from benzene storagevessels that result in the maximum risk range of 4 andmultiply; 10^5 to 4andmultiply; 10^4 are around 1 to 15 ppb. Additionally, as mentioned above,essentially all of the incidence is associated with risks in the 10^5 rangeor less; these risks are from exposure to concentrations of less than 4ppb. Average urban ambient (background) concentrations are around 3 to6 ppb (see Section IV). After consideration of the above factors, the baseline level of risk forbenzene storage vessels is determined to be acceptable under the case-by-caseapproach. <T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety.</T3> For further analysis, theAgency examined two control options that would require all vessels to haveemission reduction equipment that many vessels already have. Option 2 wouldrequire the use of internal floating roofs on fixed roof tanks, more effectiveprimary seals, improvements to fittings (e.g., gaskets), and secondaryseals on external floating roof tanks. These are the same controls thatare required for volatile organic liquid storage vessels (including benzenevessels) in 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart Kb, which affects vessels constructedor rebuilt after July 23, 1984. Option 1 would require the controls underOption 2 and additionally require secondary seals for internal floatingroof tanks. The estimated impacts of the options are shown in Table VIII-2.These include the emission reduction, annual control cost, cost per Mgof emission reductions, the residual incidence, and the maximum individuallifetime risk. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 2 112 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C  </ITAG>Option 2 would reduce the estimated maximum individual lifetime risk to3andmultiply;10^5 from the baseline range of 4andmultiply;10^5 to 4andmultiply;10^4.(Under the control options, the risks are not expressed as ranges becauseall vessels would be required to have continuous seals. Thus, no facilitycould have vessels with shingled seals, which represent the upper end ofthe baseline range). The estimated annual incidence would be reduced by0.01 to 0.06 case/yr. This option would also substantially reduce the populationexposed to risk levels of greater than 1andmultiply;10^5 and 1andmultiply;10^6.The nationwide annual costs associated with Option 2 are $0.1 million/yr,which are considered to be relatively low. The Agency also considered Option 1. However, it would result in no additionalreduction in maximum individual lifetime risk beyond that achieved by Option2. Furthermore, annual incidence would be reduced by only an additional0.01 case/yr, at a cost of $1.3 million/yr. The additional incidence reductionis associated mainly with the population exposed to lifetime risk levelsof below 1andmultiply;10^6. Under Approach A, EPA would consider Option 2 to provide an ample marginof safety. Although the baseline risks are relatively low (consideringthe conservatism in the upper end of the range), they can be reduced furtherat a reasonable cost using available control technology. Additional controlsbeyond Option 2 are not warranted. The costs of additional controls aredisproportionately high considering that no additional reduction in maximumindividual lifetime risk and only a small reduction in annual incidencewould be achieved. The regulation proposed under this approach would consist of the equipmentspecifications and operating practices described in Section XII. A question in all of the approaches for the ample margin of safety decisionsis whether to require all technically feasible controls for which costsare in some sense reasonable no matter how small the health risk or whetherthere is some risk reduction which is too small to warrant the public costof rulemaking. Public comment is requested on this area. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach B. Incidence-Based Approach </ITAG><T3>Decision on Acceptable Risk. </T3>Total annual incidence resultingfrom benzene emissions from storage vessels is estimated to range from0.05 to 0.1 case/yr. As previously described, the range reflects the rangein emission estimates. The lower end of the range is based on the assumptionthat all plants have continuous seals while the upper end is based on theassumption that some vessels are equipped with shingled seals, which emitmore benzene than continuous seals. Under the criteria of the incidence-basedapproach, the baseline level of risk for benzene storage vessels wouldclearly be acceptable. <T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety</T3>. For benzene storage vessels,the estimates of annual incidence and maximum individual risk at the baselineemission level are relatively low and the upper end of the estimated rangesare conservative. Essentially all of the annual incidence is associatedwith lifetime risks below 1andmultiply;10^5, and the great majority of incidence(about 80 percent, or 0.08 out of 0.1 case/yr) is associated with lifetimerisk levels of below 1andmultiply;10^6. Risk levels of 1andmultiply;10^5 andbelow are associated with ambient concentrations of 0.4 ppb and lower,which is close to the average rural background exposure. The baseline estimates reflect the assumption that most storage vesselsare already fitted with equipment that reduces emissions. However, additionalreduction in risk would occur by requiring that all vessels have emissionreduction equipment. Table VIII-2 shows the impacts of two control optionswhich are described under the discussion for Approach A. Option 2 wouldreduce the estimated maximum individual lifetime risk to 3andmultiply;10^5and incidence by 0.01 to 0.06 case/yr (from baseline) at a reasonable cost.Option 1 would further reduce residual incidence by 0.01 case/yr and wouldnot change the maximum individual lifetime risk compared to Option 2. Thiswould cost $1.3 million/yr. For these reasons (which are described morefully under Approach A), Option 2 would be considered to provide an amplemargin of safety under Approach B. Additional control beyond Option 2 wouldnot be warranted. The details of the equipment specifications and operatingpractices that are proposed under this approach are described in SectionXII. As with Approach A, a question was whether to require in the ample marginof safety step all technically feasible controls for which costs are insome sense reasonable no matter how small the health risk or whether thereis some risk reduction which is too small to warrant the public cost ofrulemaking. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach C. 1andmultiply;10</ITAG>^4 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproach <T3>Decision on Acceptable Risk.</T3> As shown in Table VIII-1, the estimatedmaximum individual lifetime risk at baseline ranges form 4andmultiply;10^5to 4andmultiply;10^4. The upper end of the range, which exceeds the targetrisk, reflects the assumption that all storage vessels at the maximum riskplant have shingled seals. Under the criteria of the approach requiringtarget maximum risks in the range of 1andmultiply;10^4 or less, the baselinerisks would not be considered acceptable. Additional control would be necessaryto reduce risks to an acceptable level at or below the 1andmultiply;10^4target. <T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety</T3>. Reduction in maximum individuallifetime risks to below the 1andmultiply;10^4 level can be achieved throughapplication of available emission control equipment. Two options consideredare shown in Table VIII-2. As previously noted, many benzene storage vesselsare already fitted with emission reduction equipment at baseline. As notedin Approach A, Option 2 would require that all vessels have emission reductionequipment including the use of internal floating roofs on fixed roof tanks,more effective primary seals, improvements to fittings (e.g., gaskets)and secondary seals on external floating roofs. This option would reducethe estimated maximum individual lifetime risk to 3andmultiply;10^5, whichis within the target range. Estimated annual incidence would be reducedby 0.01 to 0.06 case/yr. This would substantially reduce the populationexposed to risk levels of greater than 1andmultiply;10^5. Control of themaximum individual risk to this level also reduces the population exposedto lifetime risks levels between 1andmultiply;10^6 and 1andmultiply;10^5. Thecosts associated with this option are about $0.1 million/yr, which areconsidered to be low. Option 1 would result in no additional reduction in maximum individualrisk beyond that achieved by Option 2 (i.e., maximum risk would remainat the 3andmultiply;10^5 level). Furthermore, annual incidence would be reducedby only an additional 0.01 case/yr, at a cost of $1.3 million/yr. The additionalincidence reduction is associated mainly with the population exposed tolifetime risk levels of below 1andmultiply;10^6. Under Approach C, EPA would consider Option 2 to provide an ample marginof safety. This option would reduce the maximum individual risk to withinthe target range and well below the 1andmultiply;10^4 level. As describedabove, the population exposed to lifetime risks in the 10^5 and 10^6 rangeswould be significantly reduced. Additional controls beyond Option 2 arenot warranted. The costs of additional controls are disproportionatelyhigh considering that no additional reduction in maximum individual riskand only a very small reduction in annual incidence would be achieved.The regulation proposed under this approach would consist of the equipmentspecifications and operating practices described in the summary of standardsin Section XII of this preamble. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach D. 1andmultiply;10</ITAG>^6 or Less Maximum Individual Approach<T3>Decision on Acceptable Risk</T3>. At baseline, the estimated maximumindi vidual lifetime risk ranges from 4andmultiply;10^5 to 4andmultiply;10^4,as described in previous sections. Since this is clearly above the 1andmultiply;10^6target risk level of Approach D, baseline risks would be judged unacceptableunder this approach. Under this approach, EPA would propose standards toreduce the maximum individual risk to 1andmultiply;10^6 or less. <T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety</T3>. The EPA cannot explicitlystate at this time what control technologies would be capable of achievingmaximum individual lifetime risk levels of 1andmultiply;10^6 or lower forall facilities with benzene storage vessels. As shown in Table VIII-2,application of the identified control techniques (Options 1 and 2), wouldresult in an estimated maximum individual risk of 3andmultiply;10^5, whichis still significantly above the target level of Approach D of 1andmultiply;10^6.Therefore, a facility emission limit (or risk limit) is currently the onlymeans of reducing maximum individual risks to below 1andmultiply;10^6 atall sites. As previously discussed in the EB/S section (Section VII) underApproach D, an emission limit format has been selected for illustrativepurposes, however comments on both formats are requested.   The emission limit that would ensure that no facility produces maximumindividual risks exceeding 1 andmultiply; 10^6 is 0.47 kg/day (170 kg/yr).This emission limit would apply to the combined emissions from all benzenestorage vessels located at a facility. The emission limit was calculatedby proportional reduction of emissions from the storage facility with thehighest maximum individual risk per unit of emissions.With an emission level of 0.47 kg/day, annual emissions for the estimated126 plants would be reduced to below 22 Mg/yr if all plants continued tostore benzene. Annual incidence from benzene storage vessels would be reducedto about 0.002 case/yr, and no individual would be exposed to a lifetimerisk level greater than 1 andmultiply; 10^6. Moreover, the majority of thepopulation would be exposed to lifetime risk levels much lower than 1 andmultiply;10^6. Therefore, under Approach D, this emission limit would be judgedto provide an ample margin of safety.Since EPA has not identified control techniques that would reduce emissionsto 0.47 kg/day at all facilities, the owners or operators would have todetermine the appropriate means of demonstrating compliance with the standard.One possibility that a plant may consider for complying with the emissionlimit is the venting of emissions from all storage vessels to a combustiondevice, such as a flare. However, EPA does not presently know if the emissionlimit could be achieved at all plants if this technique were applied tofixed roof vessels with no control equipment such as internal floatingroofs. Moreover, EPA is not able to determine at this time whether thecombination of emission reduction equipment (i.e., Options 1 and 2 in TableVIII-2) with a flare could achieve the emission limit at all plants. Thisis because EPA does not presently know if the emission reduction equipmentspecified in Options 1 and 2 will achieve as much control when used incombination with a flare as when used alone.Because EPA does not know how the standard might be achieved, EPA cannotat present estimate the costs or economic impacts (including the potentialfor closures) of achieving this emission limit. However, it is expectedthat, at a mininum, the costs would be greater than those shown for themost stringent identified control technology (Option 1) in Table VIII-2.For example, the cost of retrofitting existing storage vessels with add-oncontrol devices, such as flares, would vary with vessel design and thecontrol device added. If a flare were used, an existing vessel may haveto be replaced if it were unable to handle an inert gas blanket (whichmay be needed to avoid venting oxygen-containing streams to the flare).Also, the cost would vary depending on whether a flare were available onsite,and on the amount of supplemental fuel that was necessary for the flare.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Equipment Leaks</ITAG>Source Category OverviewTypical stationary sources which handle benzene and, therefore, are likelyto have fugitive benzene emissions from equipment leaks are petroleum refineries,chemical plants, and bulk storage terminals. As of publication of the finalrules for benzene equipment leaks in 1984, there were 131 such facilitiesin the United States. These facilities are now required to be in compliancewith the standard specified in 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart J, that was promulgatedin 1984.In these facilities, the fugitive emission sources of benzene are piecesof equipment handling process streams that contain benzene. These sourcesinclude pumps, pipeline valves, open-ended valves, flanges, compressors,safety/relief valves, sampling connections, process drains, and productaccumulator vessels. The standard affects equipment that contacts processstreams with at least 10 percent benzene (by weight).Estimation Methods and UncertaintiesThe evaluation of human health effects of benzene emissions from equipmentleaks involved estimating emissions from the equipment sources describedabove and then using the HEM to predict concentrations, exposures, andleukemia risks from the estimated exposures. In addition to the uncertaintiesinherent in estimating risk described in Section IV of this preamble, considerableuncertainty is involved in estimating emissions from equipment leaks ofbenzene. This section describes the methods EPA used and highlights areasof uncertainty, so that the basis and limitations of the EPA's estimatescan be better understood.When Subpart J was promulgated in 1984, EPA estimated the NESHAP wouldreduce benzene emissions from equipment leaks by about 69 percent fromthe existing baseline. The standard was estimated to reduce benzene emissionsfrom about 7,900 Mg/yr to 2,500 Mg/yr. The estimate of 2,500 Mg/yr is basedon all 131 facilities existing in 1984 implementing the requirements ofSubpart J. The Agency's current estimate of benzene emissions from equipmentleaks remains as 2,500 Mg/yr. This estimate has not been revised to reflectchanges in the number of facilities or changes in typical industry practiceswhich might have occurred after promulgation of the standard and whichmight have affected the quantity of benzene emitted from equipment leaks.To be meaningful, such adjustments must be based on additional informationand actual analysis of current industry practices. However, such analysisand revisions to the emission estimate based on a new analysis were notfeasible in the time available for reconsideration of the standard.A model unit methodology based on estimated average numbers of variousequipment components was used to estimate benzene equipment leak emissions.Emissions for each model unit were estimated using petroleum refinery VOCemission factors for each equipment component as explained in a memorandumto the docket (Docket No. A-79-27, Docket Item IV-B-22) and in the PromulgationBID. Average weight percentages of benzene assumed for each model unit'sprocess stream were used to adjust the VOC emissions to total benzene emissionsas described in the Proposal BID, pp. 7-6 to 7-7. The petroleum refineryVOC emission factors were developed statistically from field measurements.An explanation and analysis of emission factor development may be foundin the AID. Emission estimates made using the emission factors and modelunits were aggregated on a process unit basis to develop nationwide estimatesand on a facility basis to estimate population exposures and risks (DocketNo. A-79-27, Docket Item IV-B-11).As stated previously, the 2,500 Mg/yr was based on compliance by all facilitieswith the NESHAP. Control efficiencies reflected in this estimate were basedon estimates of efficiencies of NESHAP controls as shown in Table IX-1for each equipment type. Finally, the entire emission estimation procedureis described more completely in the Promulgation BID and the AID.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 2 122</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>In evaluating uncertainties in the emission estimates, two issues shouldbe mentioned. One involves the representativeness of petroleum refineryaverage emission factors used for estimating emissions of benzene. Thebenzene sources overall may have lower percentages of leaking equipmentthan were observed in the petroleum industry before implementation of leakcontrols. Recent studies indicate that the percentage of leaking componentsis probably lower than previously estimated due to changes over time anduse of better controls for chemicals such as benzene with known human healthrisks. Specifically, limited surveys of sources subject to Subpart J showthat the leak frequencies for valves are 2 percent or less (Docket No.A-79-27, Docket Items VII-I-2, VII-E-4, VII-D-2, VII-B-2). Evidence showsthat improved maintenance does result in fewer leaking components and loweremission rates (Docket No. A-79-27, Docket Item VII-B-2). This lower percentageof leaking sources indicates that emission estimates may be overstated.The equipment leak estimates were calculated using factors estimating emissionsfor leaking and for nonleaking equipment, and these factors reflect averageemission rates from facilities with higher percentages of leaking sources.For facilities with lower percentages of leaking sources, these factorswill overestimate emissions for two reasons. First, the percentage of leakingsources, and hence the overall factor is overstated. Second, the averageemission rates for leaking and nonleaking sources will not be characteristicof the distribution of sources at the facility. Therefore, the 2,500 Mg/yrestimate for equipment leak benzene emissions is likely to be overstated.However, the EPA believes that this level of control would not necessarilybe found in the absence of a regulation. The second uncertainty involved in the emission estimates concerns theassumed use of ordinary pumps and values in the model units. In actualpractice, many facilities may use equipment with a lower potential to leak.Information has been submitted to the Agency showing that primary pumpsin benzene service have been equipped with dual mechanical or packlessseals in some facilities (Docket No. A-79-49, Docket Item II-D-13; DocketNo. OAQPS 79-3, Part II, Docket Item II-D-008; Docket No. A-79-27, DocketItems II-D-65, II-D-70, II-D-77). The use of equipment with lower leakrates is not reflected in the emission estimates. Moreover, as mentionedpreviously, within the time allowed for reconsideration of the standard,it was impossible to revise the analysis of industry practice. Consequently,the emission estimates for the 131 facilities were viewed as upperboundestimates, and it is recognized that actual emissions today may be substantiallylower. The benzene equipment leak emission estimates for the 131 plants were inputto the HEM and used to estimate population exposure and leukemia risks.Modeling revisions since 1984 included an extension of the modeling radiusaround each source from 20 to 50 km, and incorporation of the revised URE.For a general discussion of risk assessment and modeling uncertainties,the reader is referred to Section IV of this preamble. In addition to the general modeling uncertainties discussed in SectionIV, dispersion modeling of equipment leaks contains more uncertainty thanmodeling of emissions from stacks because equipment leaks are area sources.Only extremely limited verifications of area source modeling methodologieshave been done to date. It is not possible to estimate the uncertaintybecause the uncertainty varies with the specific plant location and themeteorology used.Risk Characterization In deciding what level of risk is acceptable for equipment leaks underthe four approaches, EPA considered the range of levels shown in TableIX-2. The levels represent example scenarios to show how different emissionlevels would result in different health risk profiles. Table IX-2 summarizesthe risks (i.e., annual incidence, maximum individual lifetime risk, riskdistribution, and incidence by risk group) that were estimated for thebaseline emission level and two lower emission levels, shown as EmissionLevels A and B. The baseline represents the emissions remaining after applicationof the NESHAP promulgated in 1984 (i.e., 2,500 Mg/yr).<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">insert illustration 2-126</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>Application of Alternative Policy Approaches The decisions that would result from application of each of the four policyapproaches, described in Section V, to the benzene equipment leaks categoryare presented below.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach A. Case-by-Case Approach </ITAG>Decision on Acceptable Risk. As shown on Table IX-2, the estimated maximumindividual lifetime risk of 6 andmultiply; 10^\4\ at the NESHAP emissionlevel would fall within the range generally considered to be preferredunder the case-by-case approach. (This is the increased risk of contractingcancer if an individual were exposed continuously to the maximum modeledannual average concentration of 35 ppb for 70 years). The estimated annualincidence at baseline is 0.2 case/yr, and nearly all of these cases occurin the large population exposed to predicted lifetime risks in the 10^\6\range and lower. As noted in Section V, incidence estimates at the 10^\6\and lower risk levels are given less weight under this approach becausethey are generally considered to be small and the uncertainty in the riskestimates increases at these lower risk levels. In deciding an acceptable risk level under the case-by-case approach, EPAparticularly examined the uncertainties discussed in Section IV and describedearlier in this section. The assessment of these factors is summarizedbelow. The overall weight of evidence for benzene carcinogenicity is strong(the URE is based on data from occupational exposure studies). Althoughthe use of alternative dose/response models could produce different URE'sfor benzene (Docket Number OAQPS 79-3, Part I, Docket Item VIII-A-4), thelinear non-threshold model used by EPA represents the best fit for theavailable data. The model is judged, however, to be conservative and therefore,the URE, as a measure of leukemogenic potency, could be considered to errin favor of the protection of public health. This URE, however, does notinclude nonleukemia cancer risks because statistical associations withother cancers have been found to date only in animal bioassays. As previously noted, exposure modeling contains uncertainties and is basedon emission estimates and other assumptions that, in this case, tend tooverstate exposures. Specifically, the assumption that individuals areexposed continuously to the maximum modeled annual average concentrationfor 70 years may overestimate maximum individual lifetime risk. The assumptionthat the facilities will continue to operate at the same emission ratefor 70 years particularly tends to overstate exposures because it ignoreschanges in design and operation of chemical plants and petroleum refineries.Furthermore, as discussed in the previous section, the annual emissionestimates used in the analysis are considered to represent an upperboundestimate. If actual emissions and the expected decline in emissions overtime could be considered in the exposure analysis, the risk estimates wouldbe proportionally lower. Even under these conservative emission assumptions, the estimated annualleukemia incidence is relatively low, 0.2 case/yr. Of this incidence, themajority is associated with lifetime risks of 10^\6\ and lower. Only 0.02case/yr is associated with 10^\5\ risks and 0.007 caes/yr is associatedwith risks of 1 andmultiply; 10^\4\ and greater. It is estimated that noone would be exposed to lifetime risks of 1 andmultiply; 10^\3\ or higher,and the population at risk in the 10^\4\ range is estimated to be 3,000.More than 90 percent of the predicted annual incidence is associated withthe population exposed to benzene concentrations of less than 4 ppb, concentrationswhich are comparable with risks of less than 10^4. These concentrationsare similar to average urban ambient (background) concentrations describedin section IV. Thus, after consideration of all of the above factors concerning the estimatedmaximum individual lifetime risk and annual incidence, the large proportionof the incidence associated with lifetime risks of less than 1andmultiply;10^6,and the likely overstatement of emissions, the Agency would propose thatestimated baseline risks due to emissions of benzene from equipment leaksare acceptable under Approach A. <T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>As discussed above, the baselinerisks would be acceptable under Approach A. Further analysis of equipmentleaks was based on a review of the leak controls identified during thedevelopment of the NESHAP for this source category. For these sources,the estimated impacts of application of additional controls (Option 1)are shown in Table IX-3. The emission reduction, anticipated cocontrolof VOC, annual control costs, cost per Mg of emission reduction, residualincidence, and maximum individual lifetime risk were estimated. Table IX-3shows the emission, risk, and cost impacts of the identified additionalcontrol techniques. The additional control of Option 1 reflects use ofdual mechanical seals for pumps and sealed bellows valves. For the purposesof this analysis, this equipment is considered to be leakless (i.e., 100-percentcontrol). It is not known if leakless valves/sealed bellows valves areavailable for all sizes and types of equipment in benzene service. Equipmentor maintenance practices that would provide emission and risk reductionsbeyond Option 1 have not been explicitly identified by EPA. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration 2 130 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>Under Option 1, the estimated maximum lifetime risk would be reduced from6andmultiply;10^4 to 2andmultiply;10^4, and the annual incidence would be reducedfrom 0.2 case/yr under the current NESHAP baseline to 0.1 case/yr. Themajority of this incidence reduction occurs among the population exposedto lifetime risks less than 10^4 (i.e., exposed to concentrations of lessthan 4 ppb). As previously noted, these estimates are based on upperboundemission estimates. The actual emission reduction is expected to be lessthan indicated and the risk reduction would be proportionally lower. Theadditional annual cost to achieve Option 1 is estimated to be $52.4 million(Docket No. A-79-27, Docket Item V-A-1). The costs were computed usingthe annual cost per control component and the number of components usednationwide in existing units (Docket No. A-79-27, Docket Item IV-B-14).The majority of the estimated cost is from the cost of sealed bellows valvesand would be incurred regardless of the magnitude of the actual emissions.Although Option 1 shows some additional emission and risk reduction tobe achievable, the control cost is disproportionately great when comparedto the small reductions in risk which would be achieved. If the actualemission reduction were known and used, the option would likely be evenless cost effective. Recognizing the conservatism in the emission estimates,the large proportion of the incidence associated with lifetime risks lessthan 1andmultiply;10^6, the questions regarding technical feasibility, andthe costs of additional controls, under Approach A the Administrator wouldconsider the emission levels associated with the existing NESHAP to protectpublic health with an ample margin of safety. Therefore, additional controlbeyond the existing NESHAP would not be warranted and thus would not berequired under Approach A. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach B. Incidence-Based Approach </ITAG><T3>Decision on Acceptable Risk. </T3>Under the criterion of this approach,the incidence of 0.2 case/yr associated with the existing benzene equipmentleaks standard would be acceptable. <T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>Since the predicted risk andincidence resulting from the current standard would be found acceptableunder Approach B, the Agency would then consider other factors in determiningan ample margin of safety. First uncertainties associated with the dose/responsemodel were examined. As shown in Table IX-2, about 90 percent of the leukemiaincidence is associated with risk levels less than 1andmultiply;10^5, whichcorresponds to exposure to benzene concentrations of less than 0.4 ppb.As noted in Section V, risk estimates in the 10^6 range and lower are givenless weight because they are generally considered to be small and uncertaintyin the risk estimates increases at these lower levels. Additionally, actualrisks may be substantially lower due to actual leak frequencies in equipmentsubject to the NESHAP being lower than was assumed in the analysis. Othersources of uncertainty are discussed in Section IV and under Approach Ain this section. Next, EPA reviewed emission controls which were identified during developmentof the NESHAP for this source category. Table IX-3 shows the effects ofan additional control level, Option 1, which reflects the use of dual mechanicalseals for pumps and sealed bellows valves. For the purposes of this analysis,this equipment is considered to be leakless (i.e., 100 percent control).It is not known if leakless valves/sealed bellows valves are availablefor all sizes and types of equipment in benzene service. Equipment or maintenancepractices that would provide emission and risk reductions beyond Option1 have not been explicitly identified by EPA. Risk reduction, cost, and cost effectiveness of controls were also examinedin the evaluation of ample margin of safety. Under Option 1, the estimatedmaximum lifetime risk would be reduced from 6andmultiply;10^4 to 2andmultiply;10^4,and the annual incidence would be reduced from 0.2 case/yr under the currentNESHAP baseline to 0.1 case/yr. The majority of this incidence reductionoccurs among the population exposed to lifetime risks less than 10^4 (i.e.,exposed to concentrations of less than 4 ppb). As previously noted, theseestimates are based on upperbound emission estimates and the actual emissionreduction is expected to be less than indicated. As discussed under ApproachA for equipment leaks, the additional annual cost to achieve Option 1 isestimated to be $52.4 million. The majority of the estimated cost is fromthe cost of sealed bellows valves and would be incurred regardless of themagnitude of the actual emissions. Although Option 1 shows some additional emission and risk reduction tobe achievable, the control cost is disproportionately high when comparedto the small reductions in risk which could be achieved. If the actualemissions, and thus emission reduction, could be quantified, the optionwould likely be even less cost effective. Under the criteria of this approach, the existing NESHAP would be judgedto protect public health with an ample margin of safety. Additional controlwould not be judged warranted considering the small emission and risk reductionthat would be achieved, the questions regarding technical feasibility,and the large cost. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach C. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^4 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproach<T3>Decision on Acceptable Risk. </T3>Under the assumptions used in theanalysis, the maximum lifetime risks under the existing benzene equipmentleaks NESHAP is 6 andmultiply; 10^4. Under the criterion of the approachrequiring target maximum risks of 1 andmultiply; 10^4 or less, the baselinerisks would not be considered acceptable. Additional control would be necessaryto reduce maximum lifetime risks to 1 andmultiply; 10^4 or below.<T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>To ensure that no facilityhas risks exceeding 1 andmultiply; 10^4, emission reductions beyond Option1 would be required. Therefore, the only method of specifying the levelof control necessary to achieve a maximum lifetime risk of 1 andmultiply;10^4 or less at all facilities would be through either a standard limitingfacility emissions or a risk level standard. As previously discussed inSection VII, Approach D, a facility emission limit format has been selectedto illustrate this. Comments are requested on both formats, however.The emission limit for benzene equipment leaks which ensures that no facilityengenders risk exceeding 1 andmultiply; 10^4 would be 14 kg/day (5 Mg/yr).Thus, emissions from all 131 plant sites would, at the minimum, be reducedto less than 700 Mg/yr total. This 14 kg/day limit would apply to benzeneemissions from all equipment contacting benzene at each and any plant sitewhich contains equipment subject to the existing NESHAP. As discussed inSection VII, this limit was derived by proportional calculations of maximumrisks and corresponding emissions.In addition to ensuring that no one is exposed to lifetime risks greaterthan 1 andmultiply; 10^4, the 14 kg/day emission limit would also reducerisks to the total exposed population. Incidence would be reduced to roughly0.07 case/yr total (if all 131 facilities continued to operate), and ofthis about 0.007 case/yr (or 7 cases in 1,000 years) would occur in thepopulation exposed to lifetime risks greater than 1 andmultiply; 10^5. Manyfacilities would have maximum risks below 1 andmultiply; 10^6, and the additionalemission reduction will primarily reduce the exposure levels of the populationswhich are currently in the less than 10^6 lifetime risk category.Based on available information, it is believed that the 14 kg/day emissionlimit will require control beyond Option 1 at all but the very smallestfacilities. However, to ensure that no facility achieving less than 14kg/day through a leak detection and repair program allows emissions toincrease, the current NESHAP (40 CFR Part 61, Subpart J) would still berequired. The majority of facilities would have to achieve an additional50 percent emission reduction to comply with the 5 Mg/yr emission limit.Based on available information, it is unlikely that this can be easilydone.As previously noted, the Agency has not explicitly identified controlsbeyond Option 1. Thus, if the emission limit required by this approachwere adopted, the plant owners or operators would have to determine theappropriate means of achieving essentially leakless operation throughoutthe plant. Consequently, EPA cannot at present quantify the costs and economicimpacts of achieving this emission limit. However, it is suspected thatthe costs will exceed the control costs estimated for Option 1 in TableIX-3. Based on emission rates and technical feasibility for further emissionreduction, the Agency expects that a substantial number of facilities (about100 out of 131 plants) would permanently shut down under this approach.This estimate of permanent closures is not based on cost impacts or aneconomic analysis.Of the approximately 150,000 people employed in the synthetic organic chemicalindustry, roughly 30,000 to 40,000 are estimated to be employed by facilitiesproducing benzene and benzene derivatives. (To derive this estimate theratio of benzene production and consumption capacity to total organic chemicalproduction was applied to the total industry employment). If roughly 100facilities were to close, roughly 27,000 jobs would be lost in the chemicaland petroleum refining industries. In addition to these job losses, jobswould be lost in the affected communities and in related industries, suchas manufacturers of rubber tires, lubricants, nylon fibers, and other plasticsfor consumer and military uses. The health risks associated with increasedunemployment are an additional impact that has not been quantified. Indirectimpacts of a substantial number of closures such as price increases andincreased imports have not been quantified but are expected to be significant.Higher prices would be charged for imported goods made from benzene orfor more expensive substitutes; thus, there would be a general inflationaryimpact. The balance of payments would be affected by an increase in importsof benzene-derived goods.In summary, under the 1 andmultiply; 10^4 risk target approach for NESHAP,the proposed standard would: (1) Limit benzene emissions from equipmentleaks to no more than 14 kg/day at all facilities with equipment contactingbenzene; and (2) require compliance with the existing NESHAP (40 CFR Part61, Subpart J), so as to ensure that no facility currently achieving lessthan 14 kg/day through a leak detection and repair program could allowits emissions to increase. These two requirements together would be judgedto provide an ample margin of safety under Approach C. Further descriptionof the provisions of these alternative standards are contained in SectionXII.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach D. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^6 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproach<T3>Decision on Acceptable Risk. </T3>Under the assumptions used in thisanalysis, maximum lifetime risk under the existing NESHAP exceed the 1andmultiply; 10^4 target risk and would not be considered acceptable. Additionalcontrol would be necessary to reduce the maximum individual risk to 1 andmultiply;10^6 or less.<T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>As discussed under ApproachC, the only method of specifying the level of control necessary to achievea maximum lifetime risk of 1 andmultiply; 10^6 or less would be through eithera risk limit standard or a standard limiting facility emissions. A facilityemission limit standard has been selected to illustrate this approach,but comments are requested on both types of standards.The emission limit for benzene equipment leaks which ensures that no facilitycauses risks exceeding 1 andmultiply; 10^6 would be 0.14 kg/day (50 kg/yr).Emissions from all 131 facilities would then be reduced to below 6.6 Mg/yr.The 0.14 kg/day limit would apply to all equipment contacting benzene,at any plant site that contains equipment subject to the existing NESHAP;even those facilities now exempted because they use or produce less than1,000 Mg benzene/yr would be required to comply with the emission limit.As discussed previously, this limit was derived by proportional calculationsof maximum risks and corresponding emissions.In addition to ensuring that no one is exposed to lifetime risks greaterthan 1 andmultiply; 10^6, the 0.14 kg/day limit would also reduce the totalleukemia incidence to 0.0007 case/yr in the modeled population of 200,000,000.Thus, under this approach, public health would be protected by an amplemargin of safety with this emission limit.However, the EPA has no knowledge of technology-based control measuresthat would acheive the 0.14 kg/day benzene emission rate. If this limitwere adopted as the standard, the plant owners or operators themselveswould have to determine how to achieve compliance with the standard. Consequently,the Agency cannot at present estimate the costs or economic impacts ofsuch a standard. Qualitatively, based on known control measures, emissionrates, and technical feasibility of further emission reduction, this emissionlimit would be expected to result in closures of essentially all operationsproducing or using benzene including chemical plants, petroleum refineries,and other facilities. If all 131 facilities were to close, roughly 30,000to 40,000 jobs would be directly affected. As discussed under ApproachC, other job losses in associated industries could also be expected. Thehealth risks associated with inceased unemployment also have not been quantified.Indirect impacts associated with shutdown of the industry have not beenquantified but are expected to be severe.  In summary, the proposed standard would: (1) Limit benzene emissions fromequipment leaks to no more than 0.14 kg/day at all facilities with equipmentin benzene service; and (2) eliminate the exemption existing in the currentNESHAP for facilities producing or using less than 1,000 Mg/yr of benzene.These requirements would be judged to provide an ample margin of safetyunder Approach D.<ITAG tagnum="84">X. Coke By-Product Recovery Plants</ITAG>Source Category Overview  In the Coke by-product recovery process, various components of the gasesemitted from coke oven batteries are separated and recovered to obtainproducts such as crude tar, naphthalene, light oils, benzene mixtures,and refined benzene. Benzene emissions from 44 existing plants are largelyuncontrolled and are released from a variety of sources such as processvessels, sumps, storage vessels, the cooling tower associated with thefinal cooler, and leaking equipment (e.g., pumps and valves).Estimation Methods and Uncertainties  In the analysis of the coke by-product recovery plant source category,as with other benzene source categories, emission estimates were used inestimating leukemia risk. This section discusses how benzene emissionsand the associated health risks were calculated for coke by-product recoveryplants and the uncertainties associated with these estimates.  The emission estimates presented in this notice were developed based onemission factors derived from source sampling surveys and emission tests,engineering judgment, and site-specific production rates and process informationprovided by the plants. Differences in methods of operation, operatingparameters, and design factors were taken into account to the extent possibleby averaging applicable measurements to obtain an emission factor representativeof a typical source. The nationwide emission estimates were based on applicationof the emission factors (which were in terms of benzene emissions per Mgof coke production) to site-specific information on which processes existin each plant and each plant's coke production capacity, rather than byextrapolation from model plants.  Since the 1984 proposal, revisions to the emission factors and the database have been made based on public comments. As discussed further belowin the ``Response to Comments'' section of this preamble, separate emissionfactors have been developed to distinguish furnace from foundry plantsbecause foundry plants use less volatile coal and longer coking cycles.The data base also has been updated using information provided by the industryand major trade associations at the close of the comment period for theproposal. As of November 1984, a total of 44 furnace and foundry plantswith a combined operating capacity of 50.9 million Mg/yr were identifiedthat are either in active operation or on cold-idle status (i.e., temporarilyclosed but able to restart on demand). Plants on cold-idle are includedin the data base because information is insufficient to determine whetherthese sites will be closed permanently. Nationwide baseline benzene emissionsfrom the 44 plants assuming all operate at full capacity are estimatedat 26,000 Mg/yr. More detail on the estimation of emissions can be foundin the Proposal and Revised Proposal BID's.  At proposal, the health risks attributable to benzene emissions from cokeby-product recovery plants were calculated using the HEM dispersion modelto estimate the benzene concentrations to which people living within 20km of the plants were exposed. After the 1984 proposals, the HEM was againemployed for the health risk analysis using the revised benzene URE, updateddata base and revised emission factors, and with exposure modeling carriedout to 50 rather than 20 km. In the risk analyses, EPA assumed that allplants were operating at full capacity.  The Agency acknowledges that many uncertainties are present in the emissionsand risk estimates. Uncertainties in the emission estimates include theemission factors and the application of the emission factors to variousplants that employ different methods of operation, designs, and operatingparameters; these may tend to over- or under-estimate emissions. In addition,the 44 existing plants are not all operating at full capacity and, in fact,some are on cold-idle. Thus, nationwide emissions are overestimated. Further,the declining domestic coke market makes it particularly likely that EPAhas overestimated emissions for the 70-year lifetime assumed in the exposureanalysis. Additional uncertainty also is present for the dispersion modelingof area sources, such as are found in coke by-product plants, than formodeling of stack point sources. Only extremely limited verifications ofarea source modeling procedures have been done to date. Further informationon general uncertainties in the exposure and risk analysis for benzeneare described in Section IV of this preamble.  Risk Characterization  As discussed in Section V, the first step in making NESHAP decisions isdetermination of an acceptable risk level. In deciding what level of riskis acceptable for coke by-product recovery plants under each of the fourapproaches, the Administrator considered the range of levels shown in TableX-1, as well as a zero emission level. The levels represent example scenariosto show how different emission levels would result in different healthrisk profiles. Table X-1 presents the risk estimates, calculated as describedabove, in terms of annual incidence, maximum individual lifetime risk,risk distribution, and incidence by risk group.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">insert illustration 2 143</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C  </ITAG>Application of Alternative Policy Approaches The consideration of each of the alternative approaches to decisions onthe coke by-product plant source category are summarized in this section.A summary of alternative proposed standards under each approach is includedin Section XII. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach A. Case-by-Case Approach </ITAG><T3>Decision on Acceptable Risks. </T3>As shown on Table X-1, the estimatedrisk to an individual exposed to the maximum modeled annual average concentrationof about 200 ppb for 70 years is 6 x 10^3 at baseline. This risk is abovethe range generally considered under this approach to be preferred. Theestimated annual incidence at baseline is 3 cases/yr; however, about onehalf of these cases occurs in the large population exposed to predictedlifetime risks in the 10^6 range or lower. As noted in Section V, underthis approach, incidence estimates at the 10^6 and lower risk levels aregiven less weight because they are generally considered to be small andto have increased uncertainty. In addition, the majority of the estimatedincidence (2 out of 3 cases/yr) occurs in the population exposed to risksin the 10^5 range and below. This group represents persons who would beexposed to concentrations of less than 4 ppb, which is comparable to averageurban background concentrations of about 3 to 6 ppb (see Section IV). In deciding an acceptable level for coke by-product plants under this approach,the Administrator particularly examined the uncertainties described inSection IV and earlier in this section. The assessment of these factorsis summarized here. The overall weight of evidence for benzene carcinogenicityis strong (the URE being based on data from occupational exposure studies).Although the use of alternate dose/response models could produce differentURE's for benzene (Docket No. OAQPS 79-3, Part I, Docket Item VIII-A-4),the linear nonthreshold model used by EPA represents the best fit for theavailable data. The model is judged, however, to be conservative, and,therefore, the URE, as a measure of leukemogenic potency, could be consideredto err in favor of the protection of public health. This URE, however,does not include nonleukemia cancer risk because statistical associationswith other cancers have been found to date only in animal bioassays. The dispersion modeling of area sources, such as are found in coke by-productplants, is more uncertain than modeling of stack emission sources. Theassumption in the exposure assessment that individuals are exposed continuouslyto the maximum modeled annual average concentration for 70 years will overestimatethe maximum individual lifetime risk for those individuals exposed forsignificantly less than 70 years. As previously stated, the risk analysisassumes that all existing coke by-product plants operate at full capacityover the modeled 70-year exposure period. It is reasonable to include thecold-idle plants and to assume full capacity when estimating the emissionsbecause they are presently potential sources of emissions; however, thisassumption overestimates the actual current emissions. In addition, thedecline in the domestic coke market makes it likely that the emission estimateoverstates the long-term emissions. Based on consideration of all the factors concerning exposure, the estimatedmaximum lifetime risk, and incidence, the Administrator decided under thisapproach that the estimated baseline benzene emission level from coke by-productrecovery plants is acceptable. <T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>For further analysis, theAdministrator considered several technical regulatory options. The controlsanalyzed to determine an ample margin of safety under this approach foreach of the many emission points were the same as those analyzed for theJune 1984 proposal. For each of these emission sources and controls, theemission reduction, estimated benefits of cocontrol of VOC's, control costs,and the risk reduction were estimated. The controls for individual emissionpoints then were grouped into four regulatory options of varying stringenciesfor the Administrator's consideration. These options are shown on TableX-2. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration 2/147 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C </ITAG>Option 1 would require the most stringent controls available on all emissionpoints that were analyzed at furnace and foundry plants. To achieve greaterpublic health risk reduction than estimated for Option 1 may cause theclosure of many plants. Options 2, 3, and 4 would require decreasinglystringent controls and would control fewer emission points than Option1. Many factors were considered in grouping the controls into options.They included benzene emission and leukemia incidence reductions, costs,and, to a lesser extent, the emission reduction of total VOC. In general,the least cost-effective controls were deleted first when departing fromOption 1 to develop Options 2 through 4. Also, in constructing Options2 through 4, the Agency was consistent with the promulgated rules for equipmentleaks of benzene and volatile hazardous air pollutants (40 CFR Part 61,Subparts J and V) in cases where the sources in coke by-product plantswere similar and could be controlled for similar costs. The estimated impacts of each of the four options are shown in Table X-3below. These include the emission reduction, anticipated cocontrol of VOC,annual control cost, cost per Mg of emission reduction, the residual incidence,the population at individual risk of 1 x 10^4 and greater, and the maximumindividual lifetime risk. The EPA also anticipates that there may be unquantifiedreductions in coemitted pollutants with potentially adverse health effects.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M 001 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration 2/149 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C  </ITAG>After consideration of the risk characterization, the factors noted above,and the economic impacts, the Administrator decided that under ApproachA, Option 3 provides an ample margin of safety. The Administrator's reasonsare described below. Option 3 controls 24 of the 30 emission points; 17 of the 24 emission pointsare controlled to the maximum feasible control level. It differs from theproposed rule (49 FR 23522, June 6, 1984) for only a few types of emissionpoints. More stringent control would be required for final cooler emissionsat furnace plants than proposed originally. The 1984 proposal would haverequired zero emissions from naphthalene processing for both furnace andfoundry plants, based on the use of a tar-bottom final cooler. Under Option3, a tar-bottom cooler is still the basis for naphthalene processing forfoundry plants. For furnace plants, Option 3 would require zero emissionsfrom the final cooler and cooling tower, as well as from naphthalene processing,based on the use of a wash-oil final cooler. No controls would be requiredfor storage tanks for excess ammonia-liquor, benzene, light oil, or BTXmixtures at either furnace or foundry plants. These tanks represent only3 percent of the baseline benzene emissions from coke by-product plants,and the health risks are comparably small. The originally proposed standardwould have required 90-percent control of these storage tanks. With therevised cost estimates, the 90-percent control level generally was morecostly for these storage tanks than the gas blanketing control level rejectedat proposal. For all other sources, Option 3 is the same as the 1984 proposedstandard. Many factors were considered in selecting Option 3 as the ample marginof safety under this approach. With these controls, the estimated maximumindividual lifetime risk is reduced to 4 andmultiply; 10^4 from the baselinelevel of 6 andmultiply; 10^3 (a 93 percent reduction). The population estimatedto be exposed to risk in the 10^4 range is reduced from about 100,000 toabout 2,000 after implementation of Option 3. This option also reducesthe estimated incidence from about 3 cases/yr at baseline to about 0.2case/yr, a reduction of 93 percent. Of the remaining 0.2 case/yr, only0.03 case/yr is associated with the population exposed to risks of 10^5and higher. Under Option 3, estimated nationwide benzene emissions would be reducedto approximately 2,000 Mg/yr from the baseline level of 26,000 Mg/yr. Also,estimated VOC emissions from coke by-product plants would be reduced toabout 6,000 Mg/yr_a substantial reduction from the baseline level of about171,000 Mg/yr. Because 80 percent of the plants are in ozone nonattainmentareas, this reduction is expected to have a favorable impact in helpingaffected States meet ozone standards in State implementation plans. The nationwide annual costs of Option 3 (estimated at $16 million/yr in1984 dollars) are considered reasonable, particularly when compared toboth public health risk reductions and VOC emission reduction benefits.As discussed in Chapter 8 of the Revised Proposal BID, the increase incurredin the price of furnace and foundry coke as a result of this option isestimated to be small, less than 1 percent. The EPA's economic analysisindicates that at baseline, several plants may have marginal costs of operationgreater than the price of coke. The analysis predicts that implementationof this option may add one more plant to this group. However, a companydecision to actually close a plant would be based on a number of factorsthat the economic model does not consider, including: The premium a plantis willing to pay for a secure, captive coke supply; requirements for aparticular coke quality; age of the batteries, foundry, or steel mill;continued access to profits from steel production; and management's perceptionregarding their future costs and revenues. The Agency recognizes that implementationof this option could be the factor that would trigger closure decisionsat plants that are presently marginal or operating at a loss. The EPA'seconomic analysis also examined the revised capital costs of control, asdiscussed in Appendix C of the Revised Proposal BID. The Agency judgesthat the estimated capital costs are not unduly burdensome when comparedwith normal annual investment expenditures or cash flow for companies forwhich data are available. The Administrator also considered a more stringent option for the amplemargin of safety under Approach A. This option would have required bothfurnace and foundry coke plants to meet a zero emission limit for the finalcooler, cooling tower, and naphthalene processing, based on the use ofa wash-oil final cooler. Also, this option would have established a standardfor storage tanks containing excess ammonia-liquor, light oil, BTX, orbenzene at furnace plants, based on the 98-percent control afforded bygas-blanketing systems. This more stringent level of control would decreaseemissions by only about 1,000 Mg/yr of benzene and 4,000 Mg/yr of VOC morethan Option 3. The estimated maximum individual lifetime risk would bereduced from about 4 andmultiply; 10^4 to about 2 andmultiply; 10^4, and about300 persons would be exposed to a risk of greater than 1 andmultiply; 10^4.The nationwide annual incidence would be reduced by an estimated 0.1 case/yr.However, most (about 80 percent) of this estimated reduction occurs inthe population exposed to risks in the 10^6 range or lower. Annual costswould be increased by about $5 million/yr. The Administrator decided underthis approach that this more restrictive option is not warranted consideringthe small risk reductions achieved, the small additional VOC reductions,and the greater control costs compared to Option 3.A less stringent level of control also was considered. Under this option,both furnace and foundry producers would be required to meet a zero emissionlimit for naphthalene processing, but not for final coolers and final-coolercooling towers; this would be based on the use of tar-bottom final coolers.No standard for storage of excess ammonia-liquor, light oil, BTX, or benzenewould be included for furnace or foundry plants. Also, there would be norequired control of tar storage (including dewatering) tanks at furnaceor foundry plants. For foundry plants, there would be no standard for controlof light-oil condensers, light-oil decanters, wash-oil decanters, wash-oilcirculation tanks and light-oil sumps. Selection of this option would havereduced benzene emissions by about 80 percent from the baseline level (areduction of about 3,000 Mg/yr less than the selected control level), andVOC emissions would have been reduced only by about 60 percent. This VOCemission reduction would be about 64,000 Mg/yr less than would be achievedby the higher level of control. This is particularly significant because80 percent of the plants are in nonattainment areas where further reductionsare needed. As a result of these greater emissions, the estimated annual incidencewithin the exposed population would have been about 0.3 case/year morethan under the more stringent level of control. These emissions also wouldresult in a shift in the distribution of the population towards more peopleat higher risks. For example, approximately 11,000 persons would have beenexposed to a risk level in the 10^4 range or higher. This reflects an increaseof about 9,000 more persons in the 10^4 range than under Option 3. Theestimated maximum individual lifetime risk remaining after implementationof a standard based on this less stringent option would have been 1 andmultiply;10^3. The nationwide annual costs would be reasonable (about $1 million/yr).Considering the residual benzene and VOC emissions and risk associatedwith this option and the availability of more stringent controls at reasonablecosts, the Agency decided under this approach that this option would notprovide an ample margin of safety for the public health. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach B. Incidence-Based Approach </ITAG><T3>Decision on Acceptable Risk.</T3> As shown in Table X-1, the totalleukemia incidence at baseline for the modeled population of 90,000,000persons exposed to benzene emissions from coke by-product plants is about3 cases/yr. Under the criterion of this approach (i.e., 1 case/yr), theAgency would decide that the baseline emission level is not acceptable,and EPA would propose standards to reduce the estimated incidence to 1case/yr or less. <T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety.</T3> The Administrator consideredthe technical regulatory options shown in Table X-2 for supplemental controlto ensure protection of the public health with an ample margin of safety.As shown in Table X-3, the residual incidence under each of the optionsconsidered would be less than 1 case/yr. Therefore, all of the technicalregulatory options would be considered acceptable. After considerationof the risk characterization, the information shown in Tables X-1 and X-3,and the economic impacts, the Administrator decided that under this approach,Option 3 would best protect the public health with an ample margin of safety.The basis for this conclusion is summarized below, and described more fullyunder Approach A. As previously discussed, Option 3 differs from the 1984 proposal for onlya few emission points (e.g., more stringent control for final cooler emissionsat furnace plants and no control of benzene, excess amonia-liquor, BTXmixtures, or light-oil storage tanks). Option 3 would reduce the estimatedmaximum individual lifetime risk from 6 andmultiply; 10-3 at baseline to4 andmultiply; 10-4, and the estimated incidence from about 3 cases/yr atbaseline to about 0.2 case/yr. These represent 93-percent reductions fromboth risk measures. Of the remaining 0.2 case/yr, only 0.03 case/yr isassociated with the population exposed to risks of 1 andmultiply; 10-5 andhigher. As discussed earlier, these estimates of risk are based on emissionestimates that are likely to be overestimated. Therefore, Option 3 wouldmeet the criterion for acceptable risk of this approach (no more than 1case/yr) and also would provide an ample margin of safety. Other emission,risk, cost, and economic considerations are discussed above under ApproachA. The Administrator considered a more stringent level of control which wouldreduce annual incidence by an additional 0.1 case/yr. However, as previouslydiscussed, about 80 percent of this estimated reduction would occur inthe population exposed to risks in the 10-6 range or lower. For the samereasons as discussed under Approach A, the Administrator concluded thatcontrols more restrictive than Option 3 are not warranted considering thesmall risk reduction achieved, the small additional VOC reduction, andthe greater control costs. The Administrator also considered a less restrictivecontrol level which would allow about 0.3 case/yr more than Option 3. However,about 11,000 persons would have been exposed to a risk level in the 10-4range or higher_an increase of about 9,000 more persons than under Option3. The maximum individual lifetime risk after control would be reducedfrom 6 andmultiply; 10-3 to about 1 andmultiply; 10-3. Considering the residualincidence and risk associated with this option and the availability ofcontrols at reasonable costs, the Administrator decided that under thisapproach, this option would not provide an ample margin of safety to protectthe public health. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach C. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>-4 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproach <T3>Decision on Acceptable Risk.</T3> As shown on Table X-1, the maximumindividual lifetime risk at baseline is 6 andmultiply; 10-3, which clearlyexceeds 1 andmultiply; 10-4, and hence would not be considered acceptableunder Approach C. Therefore, under this approach, EPA would propose standardsto reduce the maximum individual lifetime risk to no more than 1 andmultiply;10-4. <T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety.</T3> To ensure that no facilityhas risks exceeding 1 andmultiply; 10-4, emission reductions beyond Option1 would be required (see Table X-3). As previously discussed in SectionVII under Approach D, an emission limit approach has been selected to specifythis necessary control. Comments are requested on the emission limit approachto achieving the risk target as well as on the risk target approach itself.Based on EPA's risk analysis, a plantwide benzene emission limit of 34kg/day (or 12.5 Mg/yr) applicable to the total of all emission points identifiedin Table X-2 would ensure than no facility has risks exceeding 1 andmultiply;10-4. This limit was derived by identifying the plant with the highestrisk per unit of benzene emissions and then applying that ratio to determinethe emissions that correspond to a risk of 10-4. Different facilities would have to do different things to meet the emissionlimit of 34 kg/day. Some facilities would have to reduce emissions furtherthan the most stringent technology option, but others would apply substantiallyless control, and in a few cases, no control. To ensure protection of thepublic health with an ample margin of safety, EPA also considered additionalcontrol requirements for plants able to comply with the emission limitwith little or no control. The controls considered were those presentedpreviously in Table X-2. For the same reasons discussed under ApproachA, EPA selected Option 3 as the minimum control requirement for all facilities.Implementation of this plantwide emission limit combined with the minimumcontrol level of Option 3 would reduce nationwide benzene emissions fromcoke by-product plants from 26,000 Mg/yr at baseline to about 840 Mg/yr;nationwide VOC emissions would be reduced from about 171,000 Mg/yr to about1,900 Mg/yr. Estimated annual incidence would be reduced from about 3 cases/yrto about 0.07 case/yr. The estimated maximum individual lifetime risk wouldnot exceed 1 andmultiply; 10-4, and most of the exposed population wouldhave much lower risk. Therefore, under the criterion of Approach C, theAdministrator would consider that these combined requirements provide anample margin of safety. Based on the 1984 data and on the assumptions in the analyses, EPA estimatesthat 9 of the 44 plants would achieve the emission limit by applying Option3, 5 plants could achieve it by applying Option 2, and 18 plants couldachieve it by applying the maximum feasible controls in Option 1. In addition,the Agency estimates that 12 plants would not be able to meet the emissionlimit even with the most stringent technology option. Of these 12 plants,the Agency estimates that 8 plants may be able to comply by permanentlyreducing production by an amount that may not be large enough to triggerclosure decisions (e.g., by roughly 40 percent or less). This is basedon EPA's emission estimates, which are generally proportional to coke production.The cost of applying the technology to these 40 plants is estimated tobe $26 million/yr. The cost of lost production could not be estimated atthis time. The EPA estimates that the remaining 4 plants would need topermanently reduce production by roughly 60 percent or more in order tocomply. Although EPA has not conducted an economic analysis of this particularapproach, the Agency believes that it is likely that this reduction wouldtrigger closure decisions. These 4 plants account for 30 percent of thedomestic cokemaking capacity. Including the 8 plants that may be able tocomply by reducing production, the total cokemaking production loss underApproach C could be about 40 percent. The potential economic impacts of closures could include increased unemploymentin the affected geographic areas and the health risk associated with long-termunemployment. Based on information on the by-product cokemaking industryprepared after the 1984 proposal, about 7,000 people were employed. Ofthese 7,000 jobs, roughly 3,000 could be lost with a 40 percent productionreduction (assuming employment is reduced in the same proportion as productioncapacity). In addition to these job losses, other job losses in industriessupplying the cokemaking industry could be expected, such as in coal mining,transportation, and with equipment suppliers. The impacts could also includeloss of tax revenue from the closed facilities, coke price increases, andsubstantially greater dependence on imported coke to replace the lost production.There are two processes that may offer some long-term prospect of replacingconventional by-product cokemaking and, in doing so, eliminate the needfor by-product recovery plants. These processes are the manufacture offormcoke (coke briquettes) and direct reduced ironmaking (DRI), which isan ironmaking process requiring no coke. Neither of these processes couldbe feasible alternatives in the maximum period of 2 years that a sourcehas to comply with a NESHAP; they only may be potential alternatives overthe long term. Formcoking is the general name applied to a number of processes that convertcoal into shaped coke pieces in closed process vessels. Formcoking is expectedto create less air pollution than conventional by-product cokemaking; wastewaterimpacts are unknown. However, a complete assessment of any of the processesto confirm the anticipated environmental and health benefits has not beenmade. The use of formcoke in a blast furnace as a complete replacement for furnacecoke has never been demonstrated and the steel industry is concerned thatthe mechanical strength of the formcoke may not be adequate for this use.Yet, in order to generate enough fuel to conduct a valid blast-furnacetrial, a large formcoke plant would have to be built and formcoke producedfor an extensive period of time. Due to these uncertainties, steel firmsare reluctant to invest in such a plant without financial assistance. Twosteel industry proposals in the early 1980's requested the federal governmentto invest several hundred million dollars to assist in the design and construction(and assume some risk) of a large formcoke facility that would allow anadequate demonstration of the product coke suitability, and potential environmentaland energy-saving benefits. This funding was not provided. Also, successfulcompletion of full-scale blast furnace trials would not necessarily meanformcoke could replace all conventionally made coke. A similar experimentalprogram might be necessary to confirm that foundry coke could likewisebe replaced. The direct reduction of iron ore is an alternative to the production ofiron for steelmaking by blast furnaces that use coke for fuel. Since theproduct of direct reduction is solid iron, it is most suitable for usein combination with electric arc furnace steelmaking by replacing a portionof the scrap charge. None of the reductant processes involve the generationand recovery of benzene or benzene-containing by-products. The differenttypes of reductant processes vary in whether or not polynuclear aromatichydrocarbons (other potential air pollutants) are formed; afterburnersand control devices could potentially limit their emissions. No completeenvironmental assessment of any reductant processes has been made, however,and it is unknown whether the risks of nonbenzene pollutants would be ableto achieve the acceptable criterion of this approach. There are many more full-scale DRI plants in operation worldwide than formcokefacilities. However, the extensive use of DRI in the U.S. would mean almostcomplete restructuring of the iron and steel industry away from basic oxygenfurnaces to electric arc furnaces. This would necessitate the write-offof existing capital equipment (including blast furnaces and basic oxygenfurnaces) and investment in new capital equipment. Substantial cost andeconomic impacts would result from this. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach D. 1 x 10</ITAG>-6 or Less Maximum Individual Risk Approach<T3>Decision on Acceptable Risk.</T3> As shown on Table X-1, the maximumindividual lifetime risk at baseline is 6 x 10-3, which clearly exceeds1 x 10-6, and would not be considered acceptable under this Approach D.Therefore, under this approach, EPA would propose standards to reduce themaximum individual lifetime risk to no more than 1 x 10-6. <T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety.</T3> To ensure that no facilityhas risks exceeding 1 x 10-6, emission reductions beyond Option 1 wouldbe required (see Table X-3). An emission limit was developed to specifythe 1 x 10-6 control level for the same reasons the emission limit formatwas selected under Approach C. At the 1 x 10-6 level, the plantwide emissionlimit would be 0.34 kg/day (125 kg/yr) for the facility, including allthe emission points identified in Table X-2. This limit was derived thesame way as the limit was derived under Option C. Assuming that facilitiesmight be able to achieve compliance without closing, this emission limitwould reduce benzene and VOC emissions to approximately 5.5 Mg/yr and 12.7Mg/yr, total leukemia incidence to 0.004 cases/yr, and maximum individuallifetime risk to 1 x 10-6. Most of the exposed population would be at amuch lower risk. As discussed under Approach C, the potential for development of new technologywithin the next 2 years is doubtful. Achievement of the emission limitwithout substantial production reductions is unlikely. The EPA estimatesthat most plants would have to reduce production permanently by 95 percentor more (and all plants by 75 percent or more) as well as applying thecontrols of Options 1 in order to achieve the emission limit. As discussedin Approach C, these estimates were derived using EPA's emission estimates,which are generally proportional to coke production. The magnitude of thesecutbacks would likely cause closure of all plants, thus reducing the emissionsand risks from coke by-product recovery plants to zero. The EPA judgesthat this emission limit would protect the public health with an amplemargin of safety. The EPA can not at present estimate the cost or economic impacts associatedwith the 0.34 kg/day limit. However, the economic impacts would be severe.Adverse impacts could include increased unemployment in the affected geographicalareas and the health risk impacts associated with long-term unemploymentin a community, loss of tax revenue, price increases, total dependenceon imported coke or a total change in the steelmaking process, and potentialtrade deficits. Based on employment information discussed under ApproachC, closure of all facilities will result in about 7,000 job losses. Inaddition to these job losses, other job losses in industries supplyingthe cokemaking industry could be expected, such as in coal mining, transportation,and with equipment suppliers. <ITAG tagnum="85">XI. Summary of Major Comments and Responses on 1984 Proposed Standardfor Coke By-Product Recovery Plants </ITAG>The EPA received 20 comment letters on the national emission standardsfor coke by-product recovery plants originally proposed on June 6, 1984.These comments are available for review in Docket A-79-16. The commentsare grouped by topics that include: (1) Safety, operation, and demonstrationof emission control technology; (2) impact analyses; and (3) general comments.The following is a summary of EPA's responses to these comments; detailedresponses are included in the Revised Proposal BID (EPA-450/3-83-016b).Safety, Operation, and Demonstration of Emission Control Technology <T3>Comment: </T3>Six commenters recommended that gas-blanketing systems,although appropriate and cost effective for some plants, should not berequired at all sites because of safety, design, and operational concerns.Some commenters stated that, without redesign of process operations andinstallation of new equipment, the safety of gas-blanketing systems isin question because leaks from older pieces of equipment present a potentialfire or explosive hazard. One of these commenters submitted a qualitativecomparative study of the safety of gas blanketing for one of their plants.The report concluded that gas blanketing would involve a significant increasein risk to operating personnel and the surrounding community. Other commentersargued that the presence of electrical equipment and vehicular trafficmay present a hazard. Naphthalene clogging in cold climates if power forheated lines were lost also was cited. Four commenters claimed that gas-blanketingcontrols have not been well-demonstrated. In support, two of these commenterscited closure of one plant that had gas blanketing. <T3>Response: </T3>The EPA disagrees with these commenters. Gas-blanketingsystems have been demonstrated as safe and effective at a total of fiveplant sites over a combined operating period of more than 24 years. Theclosure of one plant has no effect on the successful use of gas blanketingat this site for the 4-year period prior to closure. As discussed in theProposal BID and in the Revised Proposal BID, gas-blanketing systems currentlyare in use at four other plant sites. The safety of recommended control systems should always be considered,and a system considered inherently unsafe would not be selected by EPAas the potential basis of a standard. In direct contradiction to the commenters'statements, EPA considers that well-designed, well-operated, and well-maintainedgas-blanketing systems will improve the safety level now found in uncontrolledby-product plants. A detailed response to these concerns is provided inChapter 5 of the Revised Proposal BID. The Agency's reasons for concludingthat gas blanketing will actually improve current safety conditions aresummarized below. One commenter contends that ``the low positive pressure of the proposedsystem is insufficient to alleviate explosive conditions if leaks occur.''The standard that would be proposed under Approaches A, B, and C do notdictate an overall pressure level for system operation. The system installedmay be positive or negative pressure or a combination of the two. The pressuremaintained will vary by necessity according to the type of source and locationof the connections to the system (i.e., at the main or the gas holder)and overall process design. If leaks in the system occur or the positive pressure blanket fails, thepossibility of an explosive atmosphere forming is no greater than the possibilityunder current plant conditions. At most uncontrolled plant sites, explosiveconditions are present. Liquid organics float on the surface of open sumpsand trenches, and they leak from equipment components and piping systemsthroughout the plant. Organic vapors also are released from ``breathing''tanks as air enters venting systems or holes in the covers. In EPA's judgment,enclosing these sources and ducting the emissions back to the process viaa closed positive pressure gas-blanketing system will reduce substantiallythe explosive hazard that now exists. The Agency does recognize that somesources at existing plants may be in poor condition and require upgradingto accept gas blanketing. The necessary modifications for typical plants,however, have been reflected in the cost estimates. The EPA reviewed a commenter's submittal of a qualitative assessment ofhis plant to support the contention that gas blanketing would involve asignificant increase in risk to operating personnel and the surroundingcommunity. However, EPA does not believe that such a conclusion can bedrawn from the assessment for several reasons. First, the assessment isqualitative; it does not draw quantitative conclusions as to the frequencyof a major failure. In the hazard assessment, probability ratings wereassigned to various hazards within the plant for present uncontrolled conditionsand gas blanketing with various blanketing gases. For example, for explosionpotential under current plant conditions, they assigned a probability ratingof ``D'' which means ``likely to occur 1 time every 10 years.'' With cokegas blanketing, the explosion potential was reduced to ``C'' which means``likely to occur every 100 years.'' However, with gas blanketing, higherratings were assigned to the potential for explosion propagation, on-sitesafety, and financial loss. These types of ratings were assigned to variousplant operations and to various control scenarios. The results were weightedand combined to provide a relative qualitative rating that may be usedby the firm in evaluating options in terms of economic and safety. However,EPA does not believe the commenter's contention based on the report iswarranted for the following reasons: (1) The report did not utilize a gas-blanketingdesign for the plant on which to base a quantitative comparison; withouta specific design, it is not possible to evaluate safety features thatcould be engineered into the system, (2) the assessment was based on areview of the existing conditions in the plant, without consideration ofthe substantial upgrading of the process vessels that would be necessaryto accommodate installation of a gas-blanketing system, and (3) the reportdid not provide any basis or criteria for assigning the probability ratingsor consequence categories that are reported. After reviewing the assessment,EPA remains convinced that the upgrading of equipment needed to accommodategas blanketing, together with the installation of the well-designed controlsystem, will improve existing safety conditions at the sites.The Agency's review of the safety aspects of gas blanketing does not supportthe contention of some commenters that the presence of electrical equipmentand vehicular traffic in gas-blanketed areas aggravates the potential explosivedanger. Hydrogen and methane are the major components of coke oven gas,accounting for 69 to 97 percent of the emission stream. According to NationalFire Code (NFC) guidelines, these lighter-than-air gases seldom producehazardous mixtures (i.e., presenting a fire or explosive danger) in thezones where most electrical connections are made. If special equipmentis required, it should already be in place at plants where the NFC or plantsafety codes have required its installation. In addition, the NFC guidelinesstate that, in the experience of the code's authors, it generally has notbeen necessary to classify as hazardous ``locations that are adequatelyventilated where flammable substances are contained in suitable, well-maintained,closed piping systems which include only the pipes, valves, fittings, flanges,and meters.''Prior to proposal of the standard in 1984, EPA thoroughly evaluated thesafety aspects of gas-blanketing systems. This review included visits tofive plant sites where safety and operational problems were discussed withplant personnel. No safety or operational concerns were reported that routineminimal maintenance would not resolve. Since the 1984 proposal additionalsafety features such as water drains and overflow connections for tar tanksand liquid level sampling/gauging instrumentation with vapor-tight sealsalso have been added to the cost. Assuming each system is properly operatedand maintained after installation, EPA considers that the positive pressuresystem is a safe and effective control technique and that leaks (if repairedas required) do not present the fire or explosive danger described by thecommenters.The EPA agrees that loss of power for heated lines could cause naphthaleneclogging in cold climates. Unless a backup power supply is available forthe entire plant, EPA assumes that such a power loss would affect mostplant operations and probably would result in a shutdown until power wasrestored. The EPA is aware if no other reasonable approach for overcomingthe effects of cold climates.<T3>Comment:</T3> Five commenters believe that negative pressure gas-blanketingsystems present a fire or explosive danger because of air infiltrationfrom ineffective sealing of older vessels, operator error, or equipmentfailure. One commenter also stated that additional monitoring controlsare necessary to monitor the explosive hazard, in addition to measuressuch as automatic nitrogen dilution or enrichment with natural gas to keepthe coke oven gas mixture below the lower explosive limit or above theupper explosive limit.<T3>Response:</T3> The standard that would be proposed under ApproachesA, B, and C (and associated cost) is based on the use of a positive pressuresystem because comments made by the industry before the 1984 proposal questionedthe safety of the negative pressure system recommended initially. Althoughthe use of a negative pressure system is not precluded, EPA encouragescompanies to install safety and monitoring equipment as necessary in accordancewith their historical safety policies and the system's characteristics.The EPA does recommend, however, that firms install the equipment includedin the costs for the positive pressure system intended to alleviate manyof the operating concerns cited by the commenters. Recommendations forspecific equipment and their application are discussed further in the RevisedProposal BID. Regarding the potential danger from equipment failure, EPAconsiders that a failure of a negative pressure system under the scenariosuggested by the commenters presents no more danger than similar situationsencountered in the current uncontrolled plant environment.<T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters are concerned that overpressurizationof a positive pressure system poses an explosive and occupational hazardbecause of the carbon monoxide (CO) released. One commenter stated thatthe presence of CO increases costs for additional monitoring and employeetraining because CO hazards do not exist currently. Similarly, anothercommenter believes that additional employees would be necessary for monitoringfor explosive conditions or that hydrocarbon detection monitoring shouldbe required on each piece of gas-blanketed equipment.<T3>Response:</T3> Coke plant operators have stated that pressure controlin the collecting main and gas holder is inherently reliable because largepressure fluctuations can cause serious operating and safety difficultiesin battery and plant operation. Collecting-main pressure is controlledby an Askania valve at a few millimeters of water pressure, and the pressureis often watched and adjusted manually if necessary. Similarly, the pressurein the gas holder also is carefully controlled. Overpressurization is preventedby bleeder or pressure relief valves and water seals.A CO hazard from coke oven gas would not be unique to blanketed vessels.The coke oven gas in handled is many parts of the coke and steel plants.If all of these locations are subject to the stated monitoring by the company,then consistent application of the policy would dictate monitoring of COand explosive conditions for gas-blanketed vessels. Although the regulationincludes costs for semiannual inspections for leaks, no costs are includedfor monitoring CO or explosive conditions because the existing systemsdid not have such provisions. Therefore, the monitoring questions on COand explosive conditions appear to be those of company policy and site-specificconditions.<T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters believe that covering and sealing sumpscreate a fire or explosive hazard from concentrated fumes because no gasor steam can be used for purging.<T3>Response: </T3>Steam purging strips organic compounds from the sumpand can be especially efficient at removing volatile compounds such asbenzene. Most sumps are installed below grade; consequently, workers andothers in the plant can be exposed to high concentrations of these organiccompounds at ground level, especially with a purge gas. The current practiceof discharging tramp steam to an open sump already poses a hazard if concentrationsare high enough to be explosive. Also, the steam purging may create themovement of explosive vapor from the sump to ground level if a surge orslug of organic material enters the sump during purging. An air-tight sealand a vent to the atmosphere are included in the sump cover costs for safetyconsiderations. The operator also may choose other measures to increasesafety, such as including a flame arrestor on the vent, installing explosivecondition detectors, or replacing the sump with an above-grade closed tank.The solution to the commenters' question will depend on the site's specificconditions and the company's policy.<T3>Comment: </T3>Several comments were received that related to the selectionof controls for naphthalene processing and final coolers. Environmentalgroups and State agencies pointed to the significant emissions and riskreduction achievable with more stringent control of the final cooler. Commentsfrom foundry coke producers on emission estimates and from the industryon costs, which are discussed in more detail in other sections of the preamble,influenced the analysis of the impacts of the controls for naphthaleneprocessing and final coolers. Also, the industry commenters submitted plansfor final coolers using indirect cooling technology that they believedto be more effective than tar-bottom final coolers and less expensive.<T3>Response: </T3>In response to comments received on the 1984 proposal,EPA analyzed the impacts of control alternatives separately for furnaceand foundry plants. Also, the costs for both tar-bottom and wash-oil finalcoolers were revised based on industry's comments. The revised costs fortar-bottom final coolers were higher than proposed; those for wash-oilfinal coolers were lower. The revised cost analysis is discussed in AppendixB of the Revised Proposal BID responding to comments on the 1984 proposal.One of the major reasons that wash-oil final coolers were not selectedas the basis of the original proposed standard is that an analysis of thecapital costs for a wash-oil final cooler compared to annual net incomeand investment indicated a potential for an unreasonably adverse economicimpact on some firms. The EPA reanalyzed the economic impact of a regulatoryoption that is slightly more stringent than the revised standard proposedunder Approaches A and B and that included wash-oil final coolers. TheAgency concluded from the new analysis (Appendix C of the Revised ProposalBID) that the capital costs were not unreasonable when compared with normalannual investment expenditures or cash flow.The Agency used the revised impacts of both wash-oil final coolers andtar-bottom final coolers when grouping the controls into the regulatoryoptions considered by the Administrator. The selection of the regulatoryoption under Approaches A, B, and C that includes wash-oil final coolersat furnace plants is explained in Section X of this preamble.Two industry commenters submitted plans for final coolers using indirectcooling technology that they believed to be more effective than tar-bottomfinal coolers and less expensive. In addition, an engineering firm thatdesigns emission control systems for by-product plants provided informationabout certain alternative indirect cooling schemes. As discussed in Chapter5 of the Revised Proposal BID, EPA based its reconsideration on evaluationsof the tar-bottom and wash-oil final coolers because they are installedat several plants and EPA had more reliable design and cost informationon them. However, the commenters' technologies could be used if they wouldachieve the zero emission limit included in the revised proposed standardfor naphthalene processing, the final cooler, and associated final-coolercooling tower at furnace plants or the zero emission limit for naphthaleneprocessing at foundry plants.One of the commenter's designs eliminated emissions from the final-coolercooling tower, but provided only partial control of the naphthalene processingoperations. Based on EPA's analysis of wash-oil final coolers at furnaceplants, EPA concluded that complete control of both the final cooler andnaphthalene processing is reasonable. In addition, EPA concluded that controlof naphthalene processing alone, based on the use of a tar mixer-settler,is reasonable for foundry plants. Therefore, the design for indirect finalcooling could be used to achieve the standard proposed for furnace or foundryplants under Approaches A, B, and C only if it included complete controlof naphthalene processing emissions.Implementation of a wash-oil final cooler, in which the naphthalene isabsorbed in wash oil, eliminates the emissions that result from the practiceof separating naphthalene from the hot well of a direct-water final cooler.Therefore, the zero emission limit for naphthalene processing that wasproposed in 1984 still is appropriate for the revised standard proposedunder Approaches A, B, and C for naphthalene processing at furnace andfoundry plants. The wash-oil final cooler (or a similar indirect coolingscheme) also would eliminate emissions from the final cooler and associatedcooling tower. Consequently, a zero emission limit for the final coolerand final-cooler cooling tower at furnace plants (as well as for naphthaleneprocessing) was selected for the revised standard that would be proposedunder Approaches A, B, and C. Wash-oil decanters and wash-oil circulationtanks are associated with wash-oil final-cooler designs. As described inthe 1984 proposed standard and in today's proposal, these would be subjectto the same gas-blanketing requirements as wash-oil decanters and wash-oilcirculation tanks occurring in the light-oil recovery operation.Under Approaches A, B, and C, if an owner or operator chose to meet thezero emission limit with an indirect cooling scheme in which the naphthaleneis absorbed in tar or another medium (such as flushing liquor), then thevessel in which absorption takes place (e.g., the tar mixer-settler) mustbe gas blanketed. This is consistent with the standard proposed in 1984.The use of wash-oil final coolers (or other indirect cooling systems) wouldreduce emissions of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) to the air, but could increaseits concentration in the wastewater. The Agency estimates that about 200grams (g) of HCN/Mg of coke produced could be added to the wastewatersof a medium-sized plant producing 4,000 Mg of coke/day. This increase isnot anticipated to cause problems for compliance with effluent regulations.No testing or monitoring provisions applicable to wash-oil final coolersare included in the revised proposed standard under Approaches A, B, andC because compliance would be achieved with installation of the appropriateequipment. However, any associated gas-blanketed vessels (e.g., wash-oildecanter and circulation tanks or tar mixer-settlers) would be subjectto semiannual inspections for leaks using Method 21 in 40 CFR Part 60.These requirements for gas-blanketed vessels are described in this preamblein Section XII for coke by-product plants.Compliance with the zero emission limit would be assessed through recordkeepingand reporting requirements. The owner or operator must record and keepin a readily available location a description of the control system usedto achieve compliance (e.g., schematics), the installation date, and adescription of any changes made after installation. In the initial compliancereport required by 40 CFR 61.10, the owner or operator would be requiredto submit a statement notifying EPA that the provisions of the standardare being implemented. For gas-blanketed vessels associated with the finalcooling system, the recordkeeping and reporting requirements for gas-blanketedvessels described in the 1984 proposed standard and in today's revisedproposed standard under Approaches A, B, and C would be applied.Impact Analysis<T3>Comment</T3>: Two commenters noted the effect of plant closures andreduced battery capacities.<T3>Response</T3>: The interim status of the estimated environmental impactswas acknowledged in the preamble to the proposed standard (49 FR 23524).As stated, the impacts were calculated initially from a data base of 55plants. Data from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) received just beforeproposal indicated that 13 of the 55 plants had been closed. Informationwas not available, however, to determine whether all reported closureswere permanent. Consequently, the preamble presented impacts based on 42plants and stated that they would be revised after proposal.After the June 6, 1984, proposal, the information regarding closures, changesin battery capacities, and changes or corrections in site-specific operatingprocesses was updated to November 1984. These data were supplied by individualcompanies and by two major industry trade associations_the American Ironand Steel Institute (AISI) and the American Coke and Coal Chemicals Institute(ACCCI). As shown in Appendix A of the Revised Proposal BID, 44 furnaceand foundry plants with a combined operating capacity of 50.9 million Mg/yrof coke are included in the data base for the revised proposed standard.Plants on cold-idle in November 1984 are included in the data base becauseinformation is insufficient to determine whether these sites will be closedpermanently. If these cold-idle plants were deleted from the data base,the operating capacity would be reduced by about 7 million Mg/yr of coke.<T3>Comment</T3>: Five commenters stated that fewer emissions are generatedfrom foundry plants compared to furnace plants because of the use of lessvolatile coal and longer coking cycles.<T3>Response</T3>: In response to public comments received on the emissionfactors for foundry plants, EPA reviewed available information and datato determine whether separate factors were warranted for furnace and foundryplants. In general, EPA agrees with the commenters' assertions that benzeneemissions from a foundry coke plant would be expected to be less than theemissions from a furnace coke plant of similar capacity. Foundry coke isproduced from a coal mixture that contains less volatile matter than themixtures used to produce furnace coke. Data supplied by DOE on light-oilyields show that, over a 4-year period, the light-oil yields at merchantplants (mainly foundry coke producers) averaged about 66 percent of thoseat furnace plants on a per-ton-of-coal-charged basis. These yields, displayedin Table A-11 of the Revised Proposed BID, represent the principal basisfor the techniques used to adjust the emission factors for foundry cokeplants.The EPA also agrees with commenters who suggested that the lower cokingtemperatures associated with foundry coke production compared to furnacecoke production (for the same coal) would lead to production of less by-productbenzene. Although one merchant plant commenter indicated that the light-oilfrom coking contains 55 to 60 percent benzene (compared to the 70 percentassumed in the Proposal BID for furnace and foundry plants), the ACCCIprovided an average estimate of 63.5 percent for foundry plants based onan informal poll of member companies. For furnace coke production, however,a light-oil content of 70 percent still is considered appropriate.Separate emission factors for foundry plant sources were developed by applyingcorrection factors to the emission rates initially proposed for furnaceand foundry plants; computations of correction factors and the final emissionfactors are shown in Appendix A of the Revised Proposal BID. <T3>Comment:</T3> The Agency received four comments that the risks wereoverestimated because of: (1) Inclusion of the epidemiologic study by Ottet al. in developing the URE, (2) use of a conservative, linear nonthresholdmodel for dose/response, and (3) application of conservative assumptionsin the HEM, such as assuming exposure for 24 hours/day for 365 days/yearover a 70-year lifetime. One commenter felt that the risks were underestimatedbecause the analyses did not reflect updated epidemiological studies thatwould increase the URE. Also, if EPA had used the ISC model rather thanthe HEM, the estimated maximum individual lifetime risk would have beenhigher.<T3>Response:</T3> The EPA has responded to comments on the benzene UREon several occasions (see ``Response to Public Comments on EPA's Listingof Benzene under Section 112'' (EPA-450/5-82-003) and EPA's response toan NRDC petition for reconsideration of the benzene URE based on the reviewof new scientific reports on benzene carcinogenicity (50 FR 34144, August23, 1985)). In response to the NRDC petition, EPA reevaluated the benzeneURE in light of current scientific literature. The URE was revised from0.022 to 0.026/ppm, a 17-percent increase in the URE that was reflectedin the estimates of risk that accompanied the 1984 proposal. Also sincethe time of proposal, EPA has revised the modeling radius from 20 km to50 km around each plant. This reflects the Agency's judgment that the dispersionmodel yields reasonable estimates of concentrations out to 50 km. Whenadvocating the ISC over the HEM, the commenter cites in support the estimateduncertainty factor of 2 or 3 discussed for the benzene fugitive emissionsrulemaking. Comparisons of ISC and HEM do not always result in the ISCyielding higher concentrations. After comparing the two models for the1984 benzene fugitive emissions rule, EPA concluded that the use of theISC results would not change the Agency's decision on the standard. Becauseof this, the Agency decided this additional analysis for coke by-productplants was not warranted.The EPA recognizes that the assumption of continuous exposure over a 70-yearlifetime likely overestimates the cancer risk for individuals exposed forsignificantly less than 70 years. The uncertainties in the risk estimatesare discussed further in Sections IV and X of this preamble.<T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters argue that the capital costs of thestandard are significantly higher than estimated at proposal. Other commentersbelieve that the value for potential product recovery credits was overstatedor that the cost for their particular plant would be higher than the modelunit costs at proposal.<T3>Response:</T3> The cost impact analysis has been revised since proposalto respond to many of the concerns cited by the commenters. The revisedanalysis, details of which are included in Chapter 7 and Appendix B ofthe Revised Proposal BID, indicates nationwide capital costs for Option3 under Approaches A and B of about $84 million (1984 dollars) comparedto $24 million (1982 dollars) estimated at proposal. This revised estimateunder Approaches A and B includes the use of wash-oil final coolers atfurnace coke plants, which were not included in the original proposal.Of the $84 million, approximately $48.5 million (or 58 percent) is forwash-oil final coolers at furnace plants.In revising the analysis, EPA conducted a detailed review of the estimatesand data supplied by commenters. The EPA also secured the assistance ofa design and engineering firm/equipment vendor to assist in the developmentof revised unit costs. Included in the review was a site visit to a plantto resolve questions regarding equipment locations and source applicability,and to obtain examples of site-specific conditions pertinent to the developmentof the revised unit cost factors. Included in the revised analysis arehigher unit costs for most materials based on data received from commentersin addition to the data developed by the design and engineering firm. Costsalso have been added for sealing all sources, installing roofs on certainstorage tanks, adding more pipe support, installing pressure/vacuum reliefvalues for sealed sources, and making adjustment for work in hazardousareas requiring special safety precautions.As stated above, costs for wash-oil final coolers also have been revisedsince proposal. Based on information supplied by industry, the annualizedcost of a wash-oil final cooler is estimated at $872,400/yr for a medium-sizedfurnace plant producing 4,000 Mg of coke/day. The estimated capital costfor this size plant is $2.7 million. Further information on wash-oil finalcooler costs appear in Appendix B of the Revised Proposal BID.The Agency essentially agrees with the two commenters that the value ofpotential product recovery credits was overestimated at proposal. The differencein production quantity (reflected in new emission factors for foundry plants)was taken into account in the computation of revised fuel value and lightoil recovery credits. Also, the credit for light oil has been decreasedfrom $0.33/kilogram (kg) to $0.27/kg based on DOE information (see TableA-11 of the Revised Proposal BID). The fuel value recovery credit for cokeoven gas also was revised from $0.14/kg coke oven gas compared to $0.15/kgestimated at proposal. Credits for recovery of benzene and/or light oilwere applied to all plants except those few specifically identified asnot being able to benefit from recovery.The EPA acknowledges that costs for particular plants may be higher orlower than EPA estimates, depending on the site-specific conditions. However,the revised cost analysis addresses the concerns cited by the commentersand the costs are reasonable estimates of the industry-wide cost of controls.<T3>Comment:</T3> Commenters from both the furnace and foundry coke segmentsof the industry state that the economic analysis fails to consider thetrue condition of the industry at baseline and that the standard will havean adverse effect.<T3>Response:</T3> At the time the original analysis for the proposed standardwas conducted, the information from published and unpublished sources wascurrent. A reanalysis has been performed since proposal (see Chapter 8and Appendix C of the Revised Proposal BID) that utilizes data on plantsand capacity in existence in November 1984. Financial data and productiondata used in baseline estimates are from the available published and unpublishedsources as of 1984.The reanalysis also examines the economic impacts of control options interms of the effects on coke price and production, imports, and employment.These impacts have been examined separately for furnace and foundry producers.Two scenarios were used for foundry producers. Scenario A reflects a constantprice in imported coke; Scenario B assumes the maximum effect of importsubstitution. In all cases, impacts appear to be small. For the standardfor foundry plants, under Approach A or B, Scenario A would yield an increaseof less than 0.6 percent over baseline for coke prices and production.Under Scenario B, no price impact is estimated; coke production could decreaseby about 2 percent from 1984 levels. About a 0.6- and 2-percent declinein employment levels could occur at foundry plants under the Scenario Aor B, respectively. For the revised proposed standard for furnace plantsproposed under Approach A and B, coke prices could increase by about 0.33percent from baseline levels, and coke production could decrease by lessthat 0.5 percent. The level of imported coke could increase by 0.64 percent.Employment levels at furnace coke plants could decrease by less than 0.5percent as a result of Approach A or B.The economic analysis also compared the capital costs of compliance toaverage annual net investment and to the annual cash flow for individualcompanies. As shown in Appendix C, the capital costs of compliance forthe revised regulation proposed under Approaches A and B are up to 5 and8 percent of the average annual net investments and annual cash flow, respectively,for companies for which data are available.The revised economic analysis did not include an examination of the emissionlimits that would be required under Approaches C and D.General Comments<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter requests that EPA reconsider lowering thedefinition of an equipment ``leak'' from 10,000 parts per million volume(ppmv) to 1,000 ppmv or to the highest level at which the EPA can demonstrate,with data, that directed maintenance does not result in net emission reductions.<T3>Response:</T3> The Agency's rationale for selecting the 10,000-ppmvleak definition was discussed in the preamble for the original proposalof this rule, and in the rulemakings for equipment leaks of benzene andVOC in synthetic organic chemicals manufacturing plants and petroleum refineries.The issue also is discussed in EPA's response to NRDC's petition for reconsiderationof the benzene rulemakings (50 FR 34144, August 23, 1985).As discussed in Chapter 10 of the Revised Proposal BID, the key criterionfor selecting a leak definition is the mass emission reduction demonstratedto be achievable. The EPA has not concluded that a lower leak definitionis achievable. A net increase in mass emissions might result if higherconcentration levels result from attempts to repair a source with a screeningvalue between 1,000 and 10,000 ppmv. Although many leaks can be repairedsuccessfully at concentrations less than 1,000 ppmv, even one repair failurewould offset many successful repairs. Most data on leak repair effectivenesshave applied 10,000 ppmv as the leak definition and, therefore, do notindicate the effectiveness of repair for leak definitions between 1,000and 10,000 ppmv. Although data between these values are available, theyare not sufficient to support a leak definition below 10,000 ppmv. Moreover,even though there is some evidence that directed maintenance is more effective,available data are insufficient to serve as a basis for requiring directedmaintenance for all sources. In summary, EPA does not disagree with thecommenter in that additional emission reductions potentially could be achievedby reducing the leak definition from 10,000 to 1,000 ppmv. However, althoughEPA has concluded that the 10,000-ppmv level is a demonstrated and effectiveleak definition (i.e., there are enough emissions that repair can be accomplishedwith reasonable costs), EPA has not concluded that 1,000 ppmv is a demonstrateddefinition. Until EPA has adequate data to support a lower level, EPA isselecting the clearly demonstrated leak definition of 10,000 ppmv as thebasis of the equipment leak requirements.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter recommends that the standard permits theuse of a 90-percent efficient control device (e.g., a wash-oil scrubber)in lieu of gas blanketing on process vessels, tar storage tanks, and tar-interceptingsumps. The commenter suggests that the control efficiency of blanketingat an older plant may be lower than 98 percent because of leakage and downtime,and a wash-oil scrubber may achieve higher than 90-percent control.<T3>Response:</T3> The control efficiency of gas blanketing theoreticallyis 100 percent. For conservative comparisons with other controls, thisefficiency has been reduced to 98 percent to account for leakage. The 98-percentlevel or higher should be maintained continuously through proper leak detectionand repair. Although a wash-oil scrubber may achieve an efficiency higherthan 90 percent, the parameters were developed to ensure that all plantsusing this technique could achieve a 90-percent control continuously. Basedon a 90-percent control efficiency, wash-oil scrubbers are less effectivethan gas blanketing and may be more costly from a nationwide perspective.<ITAG tagnum="84">XII. Summary of Alternative Proposed Standards</ITAG>This section summarizes the format and provisions of the standards thatare proposed under the four policy approaches described in Section V. Thealternative policy approaches result in alternative standards. The rationalesfor selection of the standards for each source category under each policyapproach are contained in Section VII through X of this preamble. In thissection, general provisions applicable to all standards are listed first,followed by a summary of the alternative proposed standards organized bysource category.General Compliance Provisions<ITAG tagnum="81">Provisions Applicable to all Standards</ITAG>All of the proposed regulations would require compliance within 90 daysof promulgation for existing sources, and at startup for new sources. Methodsfor determination of compliance are described in each subpart. A waiverof compliance for an existing source could be approved by the Administratorfor no more than 2 years from the date of promulgation, as provided in40 CFR 61.11. The following reports are required by the General Provisionsof Part 61:1. An initial source, report;2. Notification 30 days prior to any emission test to permit the Administratorto have an observer present; and3. A written report regarding any emission test within 30 days followingthe test.The following records would need to be maintained on site for at least2 years, and be available for inspection by the Administrator:1. Any emission test data and calculations used to demonstrate compliance;2. Monitoring records;3. A log of startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions; and4. A log of maintenance and repair of control devices.Records on control system design and specifications would be maintainedas long as a piece of control equipment was in use.<ITAG tagnum="81">Compliance Procedures for Emission Limit Standards</ITAG>The following procedures apply to the alternative standards proposed underApproaches C and D for equipment leaks and coke by-product recovery plants,and the standards proposed under Approach D for benzene storage vesselsand EB/S process vents.Compliance with the emission limit would be determined by an emission test,calculation procedures that are described in the applicable subpart, orby an alternative method approved by the Administrator. A report of theresults of the emission test shall be submitted within 30 days of the test.If a calculation procedure or alternative method is used to determine compliance,a compliance report shall be submitted with the source report requiredin andSection; 61.10 or the notification of startup required in andSection;61.09 of 40 CFR Part 61, whichever is applicable.An operating and maintenance plan would be required within 90 days of promulgationfor existing sources, and within 90 days of startup for new sources. Theplan would have to describe any control techniques used to achieve compliance,identify the parameter(s) to be monitored, explain the criteria used indeciding on the parameters, and establish the types and frequency of maintenancenecessary. It would also include a schedule for reporting of excess emissionsor reporting of other information demonstrating continued compliance withthe emission limit. Excess emissions would be indicated by exceedencesof the monitored parameter(s) specified in the operating plan. The reportingschedule should be consistent with the compliance, monitoring, and maintenancemethods, and would be no more frequent than quarterly. The operating andmaintenance plan would be subject to the Administrator's approval.Standards for EB/S Process Vents<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach A. Case-by-Case Approach</ITAG>No standard is proposed for EB/S process vents.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach B. Incidence-Based Approach</ITAG>No standard is proposed for EB/S process vents.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach C. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^\4\ or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproachNo standard is proposed for EB/S process vents.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach D. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^\6\ or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproachThe proposed standard would limit total benzene emissions from all processvents at any EB/S plant to 5.5 kg/day.Standards for Benzene Storage Vessels<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach A. Case-by-Case Approach</ITAG>The proposed standard would require control of all new and existing storagevessels greater than 38 m\3\ (10,000 gallons) used to store benzene witha specific gravity within the range of specific gravities specified forindustrial grade benzene in ASTM-D-836-80. It would not apply to storagevessels used for storing benzene at coke by-product recovery facilitiesbecause they are considered under the coke by-product plant NESHAP. Theproposed standard would require use of certain kinds of equipment on eachtype of benzene storage vessel. Table XII-1 lists the requirements.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 2 188</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>The proposed benzene storage vessel standard would require that fixed rooftanks include an internal floating roof. The proposed standard would alsorequire that, when an internal floating roof is added to an existing fixedroof tank after the effective date of the standard, a liquid-mounted ratherthan a vapor-mounted seal be used with the roof and that fittings on theroof be gasketed. (A mechanical-shoe seal may also be used.) Existing fixedroof tanks that already have internal floating roofs on the effective datewould not be required to have their vapor-mounted seals replaced with liquid-mountedseals, although they would be required to have their roof fittings gasketedwhen the tank is emptied and degassed for other purposes. New fixed roofstorage tanks would be required to be constructed with the same controlsas are required for existing tanks with no internal roof (i.e., with aninternal floating roof, a liquid-mounted primary seal, and controlled rooffittings) and they would also be required to have pipe columns equippedwith a flexible fabric sleeve seal. Note that if tanks were equipped witha secondary seal in accordance with the proposed standard, gasketed fittingswould not be required; the two control techniques achieve the same emissionreduction. Owners of existing and new external floating roof tanks would have to installliquid-mounted primary seals (or mechanical-shoe seals) and continuoussecondary seals meeting certain gap requirements. Existing external floatingroof tanks already equipped with a liquid-mounted primary seal, however,would not be required to add the secondary seal until the first degassingof the tank. The standard would require that each internal floating roof vessel be inspectedfrom inside prior to the filling of the vessel (if it is emptied to installcontrol equipment) and at least once every 10 years. An internal floatingroof having defects or a seal having holes or tears would have to be repairedbefore filling the storage vessel with benzene. The proposed standard wouldalso require that the internal floating roof and its seal be inspectedthrough roof hatches on the fixed roof at least once annually. However,if an internal floating roof were equipped with a primary and secondaryseal, the owner or operator could conduct an internal inspection every5 years rather than perform the annual inspections. Any major defects suchas roof sinking or primary seal detachment as viewed through the roof hatcheswould be required to be repaired within 30 days or the storage vessel wouldhave to be emptied. If repair or emptying within 30 days is not possible,the owner or operator could request an extension of up to 30 additionaldays. The proposed standard would also require that, for external floating rooftanks, the primary seal and secondary seal gaps be measured initially andat least once every 5 years for the primary seal and at least once annuallyfor the secondary seal. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach B. Incidence-Based Approach </ITAG>The proposed standard would be the same as that described under the precedingdiscussion of Approach A. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach C. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^4 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproachThe proposed standard would be the same as that described under the precedingdiscussion of Approach A. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach D. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^6 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproachThe proposed standard would limit total combined emissions from all benzenestorage vessels at a plant to 0.47 kg/day. To determine compliance, theowner or operator would calculate emissions from each vessel and add theseto estimate total facility emissions. One calculation method EPA wouldapprove is use of the equations and procedures in the EPA document ``Compilationof Air Pollutant Emission Factors'', Volume I, September 1985, EPA PublicationNo. AP-42. Other methods of demonstrating compliance could also be usedafter approval by EPA. Standards for Equipment Leaks <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach A. Case-by-Case Approach </ITAG>No new standard is proposed for control of benzene equipment leaks. Thestandard in 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart J, which was promulgated on June 6,1984, would remain in effect without revision. The standard applies toequipment components such as valves, pumps, compressors, pressure reliefdevices, open-ended valves or lines, sample connection systems, and productaccumulator vessels. Equipment that contains or contacts a fluid (liquidor gas) that is at least 10 percent benzene is required to follow specificcontrol procedures. Generally, for each type of equipment, Subpart J includesequipment specifications and/or schedules and procedures for monitoringand repair of leaks. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach B. Incidence-Based Approach </ITAG>No new standard is proposed for benzene equipment leaks. The current standardin 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart J, which is summarized in the discussion ofApproach A, would remain in effect without revision. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach C. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^4 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproachThe proposed standard would require that each facility with equipment subjectto Subpart J meet a total facility emission limit of 14 kg/day for thecombined emissions from all equipment components located at the facility.In addition, the proposed standard would include the current requirementsin Subpart J (i.e., those promulgated on June 6, 1984). Compliance withthe emission limit could be determined through the procedures establishedin the ``Protocols for Generating Unit-Specific Estimates for EquipmentLeaks of VOC and VHAP_Draft'' or through design specifications (i.e., leaklessequipment). <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach D. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^6 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproachThe proposed standard would limit emissions from all equipment componentsat any facility with equipment in benzene service to 0.14 kg/day. The proposedstandard does not retain the exemption for facilities producing or usingless than 1,000 Mg/yr that is currently in Subpart J (as promulgated onJune 6, 1984). The exemption is not appropriate under this approach becauseuncontrolled emissions from many facilities using less than 1,000 Mg/yrwould exceed the 0.14 kg/day emission limit. The current Subpart J provisionswould not be required, because this would be unnecessary since plants wouldhave to use even more stringent controls to comply with the emission limit.Standards for Coke By-Product Recovery Plants <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach A. Case-by-Case Approach </ITAG>There are two major differences between the standard proposed under ApproachA and the 1984 proposal. A design standard requiring a 90-percent emissionreduction was proposed in 1984 for storage tanks containing light oil,benzene, excess ammonia-liquor, or BTX mixtures. The Approach A proposalwould not require that these sources be controlled. Also, the standardproposed for naphthalene processing under this approach would differ fromthe 1984 proposal by requiring zero emissions from the final cooler andassociated cooling tower at furnace plants, as well as from naphthaleneprocessing. The proposed standard for naphthalene processing at foundryplants is not different from the 1984 proposal. Under Approach A, an equipment standard would be established for the controlof emissions from each tar decanter, tar-intercepting sump, tar dewateringtank, light-oil condenser, light-oil decanter, wash-oil decanter, and wash-oilcirculation tank. The rule that would be proposed under Approach A wouldbe identical to that proposed for these sources in 1984. Each of thesesources would be required to be totally enclosed with emissions ductedto the gas collection system, gas distribution system, or other enclosedpoint in the by-product recovery process. Unless otherwise specified, pressurerelief devices, vacuum relief devices, access hatches, and sampling portswould be the only openings allowed on each source. Access hatches and samplingports would have to be equipped with a gasketed cover. The standard under Approach A could be achieved with a gas-blanketing system.A gas-blanketing system is a closed system operated at positive pressureand is generally composed of piping, connections, and flow-inducing devices(if necessary) that transport emissions from the enclosed source back tothe coke-oven battery gas holder, the collecting main, or another pointin the by-product recovery process. Dirty or clean coke oven gas, nitrogen,or natural gas are examples of gases that may be used as the gas blanket.To ensure proper operation and maintenance of the control equipment, theproposed standard would require a semiannual inspection of the connectionsand seals on each gas-blanketing system for leaks, using EPA method 21test for no detectable emissions (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A). Monitoringalso would be required at any other time after the control system is repressurizedfollowing removal of the cover or opening of the access hatch. An organicchemical concentration would indicate the presence of a leak. The standardalso would require a semiannual visual inspection of each source and thepiping of the control system for visible defects such as gaps or tears.A first attempt at repair of each leak or visible defect would be requiredwithin 5 days of detection, with repair within 15 days. The owner or operatorwould be required to record the results of the inspections for each sourceand to include the results in a semiannual report. The revised proposedregulation under Approach A also would require an annual maintenance inspectionfor abnormalities such as pluggages, sticking valves, and clogged or improperlyoperating condensate traps. A first attempt at repair would be requiredwithin 5 days, with any necessary repairs made within 15 days of the inspection.An equipment standard would be proposed to require that the surface areaof each light-oil sump be completely enclosed. This proposed standard wouldbe based on the use of a tightly fitting permanent or removable cover,with a gasket on the rim of the cover. The standard would allow the useof an access hatch and a vent in the sump cover. However, any access hatchwould need to be equipped with a gasket and with a cover or lid, and anyvent would need to be equipped with a water leg seal, pressure relief device,or vacuum relief device. Semiannual inspections of the gaskets and sealsfor detectable emissions would be required; monitoring also would be requiredat any other time the seal system is disturbed by removal of the cover.The inspection and monitoring requirements would be the same as previouslydescribed for gas-blanketed sources. This revised proposed standard wouldnot allow venting of steam or gases from other points in the coke by-productprocess to the light-oil sump. The revised proposed standard also would apply to leaks (i.e., fugitiveemissions) from new and existing pieces of equipment in benzene service,including pumps, valves, exhausters, pressure relief devices, samplingconnections, and open-ended lines, all of which except exhausters comprisethose components that contact or contain materials having a benzene concentrationof at least 10 percent by weight. Exhausters that contact or contain materialshaving a benzene concentration of at least 1 percent benzene by weightalso are in benzene service. The standard for equipment leaks would beidentical to the 1984 proposed standard. Because this standard is the sameas requirements in 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart V, for equipment except exhausters,the coke by-product rule would reference Subpart V where appropriate ratherthan repeating the provisions. Subpart V also would be amended where necessaryfor clarification of the cross referencing. The specific requirements forexhausters are summarized in detail below, because they are not in SubpartV. The revised proposed standard would require that all exhausters in benzeneservice be monitored quarterly for the detection of leaks. If an organicchemical concentration at or above 10,000 ppm were detected, as measuredby Method 21, the revised proposed standard would require a first attemptat repair within 5 days, with repair of the leak within 15 days from thedate the leak was detected, except when repair would require a processunit shutdown. ``Repair'' means that the measured concentration is below10,000 ppm. The standard proposed under Approach A provides three typesof alternatives to the leak detection and repair requirements for exhausters.An owner or operator could (1) use ``leakless'' equipment to achieve a``no detectable emission'' limit (i.e., 500 ppm above a background concentration,as measured by Method 21), (2) equip the exhauster with enclosed seal areasvented to a control device designed and operated to achieve a 95-percentbenzene control efficiency, or (3) equip the exhausters with seals havinga barrier fluid system. The proposed regulation includes specific requirementsfor each of these three alternatives to the leak detection and repair requirements.For foundry coke by-product plants, the revised proposed standard underApproach A would allow no emissions from the processing of naphthaleneseparated from the final cooler water. A foundry coke by-product plantwould be defined as a coke by-product recovery plant connected to the cokebatteries whose annual coke production is at least 75 percent foundry coke.``Foundry coke'' means coke that is produced from raw materials with lessthan 26 percent volatile material by weight and that is subject to a cokingperiod of 24 hours or more. This emission limit could be achieved by aprocess modification involving the absorption of naphthalene in tar, washoil, or an alternative medium (other than water). For example, a mixer-settlercould be added to the final cooler, or a direct-water final cooler couldbe replaced by a tar-bottom or wash-oil final cooler system or anotherdesign that allows no emissions from naphthalene processing. If a mixer-settlerwere used to remove naphthalene from the final cooler water, the mixer-settlermust be gas blanketed and would be subject to the same provisions as othergas-blanketed sources. For furnace coke by-product plants, the revised proposed standard underApproach A for naphthalene-processing operations, final coolers, and theassociated cooling towers would require zero emissions from the final coolerand cooling tower, as well as from naphthalene processing. It would bebased on the use of a wash-oil final cooler; however, other final coolerdesigns that achieve zero emission limits could be used. Compliance with the revised proposed standard under Approach A would beassessed through plant inspections and the review of records and reportsthat document implementation of the requirements. On a semiannual basis,the owner or operator would be required to report the number of leaks detectedand the number of leaks not repaired during the 6-month period. The owneror operator also would be required to submit a signed statement in eachsemiannual report, indicating whether provisions of the standard have beenmet for the 6-month period. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach B. Incidence-Based Approach</ITAG>The proposed standard would be the same as that described under the precedingdiscussion of Approach A.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach C. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^4 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproachThe proposed standard would require that total benzene emissions from allemission points listed in Table X-2 not exceed 34 kg/day. In addition,the owner or operator would be required to meet the standards discussedabove for Approach A. To determine compliance with the emission limit,the plant owner or operator may calculate emissions from all affected sourcesbased on the emission factors for each unit and submit these calculationswith the initial source report. The benzene emission factors for furnaceand foundry plants, as revised based on public comments from the 1984 proposal,are included in the regulation for this approach and in the Revised ProposalBID. Alternatively, the owner or operator could choose to perform emissiontests to estimate emissions using methods and procedures subject to approvalby the Administrator. However, because EPA has not developed and promulgateda test method for determining benzene emissions from process vessels andarea sources, the owner or operator would need to provide an appropriatemethod for review and approval by EPA. For equipment leaks, establishedprocedures can be found in ``Protocols for Generating Unit-Specific Estimatesfor Equipment Leaks of VOC and VHAP_Draft''.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach D. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^6 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproachThe proposed standard would require that total benzene emissions from allemission points listed in Table X-2 not exceed 0.34 kg/day. To demonstratecompliance with the emission limit, the plant owner or operator would usethe methods described above for Approach C.<ITAG tagnum="84">XIII. Format of Alternative Standards</ITAG>Section 112 of the CAA requires an emission standard whenever it is feasible.Section 112(e)(1) states that ``if in the judgment of the Administrator,it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission standard for controlof a hazardous air pollutant or pollutants, he may instead promulgate adesign, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combinationthereof * * *''. The term ``not feasible'' is applicable if the emissionscannot be captured and vented through a vent or stack designed for thatpurpose, or if the application of a measurement methodology is not practicablebecause of technological or economic limitations. This section presentsthe rationale for the selected formats for the standards being proposedunder the four alternative policy approaches.Ethylbenzene/Styrene Process Vents<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach D. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^6 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproachThe proposed standard is expressed as a limit on the mass of benzene emittedper day to ensure that no faclity has risks exceeding 1 x 10^6. BecauseEB/S process vents vary widely in concentration and flowrates, it is notpossible to ensure that any specific concentration or emission reductionwould achieve the target risk. Therefore, a limit was placed on the totalmass emitted on a daily basis.Benzene Storage Vessels<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach A. Case-by-Case Approach</ITAG>The standard being proposed under Approach A is based on design, equipmentand operational requirements due to the infeasibility of measuring emissionsin this case. Internal and external floating roof storage vessels, bothbefore and after the identified controls are installed, do not typicallyhave a conveyance system designed to capture the emissions or a stack orvent through which the emissions pass to the atmosphere.Equipping each storage vessel with a capture and stack system would requirethat the vessel vents be sealed and that the emissions be transported toa measurement system. In most cases, the closure of the vessel vents wouldrequire the vessel to be blanketed with inert gas to prevent the creationof explosive or flammable mixtures in the vessel or measurement system.This would certainly be economically impracticable, especially consideringthat the sole purpose of the system would be for emission testing. Forthis reason the Administrator concluded that requiring emission testingto measure emissions and demonstrate compliance with an emission standardis not feasible for internal floating-roof storage vessels.External floating-roof storage vessels are open to the atmosphere in thatthey have no fixed roof. Because of this, it is technologically impossibleto equip these vessels with a closed vent system. It is possible to equipthese vessels with fixed roofs, in which case they become internal floating-roofvessels. The argument against an emission standard for internal floating-roofvessels presented in the previous paragraph would then hold for them. Therefore,the Administrator has concluded that requiring emission testing to measureemissions and demonstrate compliance with an emission standard for externalfloating-roof vessels is infeasible.The possibility of establishing a ``design, equipment, work practice, oroperational standard, or combination thereof'' was then examined. Typesof equipment available to limit emissions from fixed roof benzene storagevessels are an internal floating-roof with a liquid-mounted primary seal,or a secondary seal and controlled fittings. Equipment available for externalfloating roof tanks include continuous secondary seals. Equipment standardscan be specified to require installation of these types of controls. Operationaland work practice requirements, which consist of inspection and repairrequirements, are necessary to ensure the continued integrity of the controlequipment. Therefore, the Administrator concluded that the format of thestandard for benzene storage vessels should include a combination of design,equipment, work practice, and operational standards.Another control option allowed under the standards is a vapor control systemconsisting of two distinct parts: (1) A closed vent system and (2) a controldevice. The closed vent system collects benzene vapors that have been ventedfrom the storage vessel and transfers them to a control device that thenprocesses the benzene vapors by either recovering them as product, or disposingof them. After reviewing analyses of vapor control systems performed duringthe development of the previous NSPS for VOL storage vessels and the NESHAPfor equipment leaks (40 CFR Part 61, Subpart V) which have provisions forclosed vent systems and control devices, the Administrator concluded thatthe format of the standard for storage vessels equipped with closed ventsystems and control devices should also include a combination of design,equipment, work practice and operational standards.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach B. Incidence-Based Approach</ITAG>The same standard is being proposed under Approach B as under ApproachA. Therefore, the same format was selected for the reasons described underApproach A.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach C. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^4 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproachThe same standard is being proposed under Approach C as under ApproachA. Therefore, the format was selected for the same reasons.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach D. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^6 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproachFor the development of this standard, EPA considered establishing additionalequipment and design requirements. Because the identified controls (inOption 1 of Table VIII-2) would not achieve 1 andmultiply; 10^6 at all facilities,it is not possible at this time to use this format to specify the requiredcontrol level. Therefore, a limit was placed on the total benzene emissionsfrom all storage vessels at a facility.Equipment Leaks<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach C. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^4 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproachFor the development of this alternative standard, EPA considered establishingadditional equipment and design requirements. (In selecting the formatfor the current Subpart J, EPA had previously determined that mass, concentration,or percent reduction formats were not feasible or practicable.) Becausethe additional controls available would not achieve 1 andmultiply; 10^4 atall facilities, it was not possible to use an equipment and design formatto specify the required control. Therefore, the format selected was a dailymass emission limit that would not exceed 1 andmultiply; 10^4 risk. Thisemission limit may be achieved through design of the facility to minimizethe number of components as well as through use of leakless equipment.Additionally, the standards retain requirements of Subpart J (as promulgatedon June 6, 1984), which are expressed as equipment, design, and work practicestandards because some small facilities may be able to reduce emissionsto below the 14 kg/day emission limit by compliance with these provisions.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach D. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^6 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproachA limit on the mass of emissions per day was chosen for this standard forthe same reasons described under Approach C.Coke By-Product Recovery Plants<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach A. Case-by-Case Approach</ITAG>As described in detail for each emission source in the June 6, 1984, proposal,pollutants are not emitted through a conveyance or are not practicableto measure for many of the sources in coke by-product plants. Therefore,the proposed standard under Approach A is a combination of emission limits,equipment, work practice, and operational requirements, depending on thesource to be controlled.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach B. Incidence-Based Approach</ITAG>The same standard is being proposed under Approaches A and B. Therefore,the format was selected for the same reasons.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach C. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^4 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproachThe emission rate corresponding to the 1 andmultiply; 10^4 target is 34 kg/dayfrom all emission points listed in Table X-2. Since EPA has not identifiedany control equipment or procedures that would achieve this emission levelat all facilities, it was not possible to specify the standard solely interms of emission standards for particular equipment, work practice, andoperational requirements depending on the source to be controlled. Therefore,a limit was placed on total daily benzene emissions from all affected sourcesin coke by-product recovery plants. In addition, since some facilitiescould comply with the 34 kg/day standard using less than the provisionsof the proposed standard under Approach A, the standard also specifiesminimum control requirements (i.e., the requirement of Approach A) in termsof equipment, design, work practices, and emission limits on particularsources.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach D. 1 andmultiply; 10</ITAG>^6 or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproachA limit on the mass of emissions released per day from the total of allemission points listed in Table X-2 was chosen for this standard for thesame reasons described under Approach C.<ITAG tagnum="84">XIV. Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The information collection provisions associated with the proposed ruleshave been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>Comments on these requirements should be submitted tothe Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, 726 Jackson Place,NW., Washington, DC, 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA'',as well as to EPA. Please note on the comments that they apply to ICR Number1080. The final rules will respond to any OMB or public comments on theinformation collection requirements.During the first 3 years that the proposed standards would be in effect,the public reporting burden for collection of information, including timefor reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information is estimated to be:(1) 4,184 averaged annual hours with an average of 322 hours/yr per respondentfor EB/S plants' process vents under Approach D;(2) 2,134 averaged annual hours with an average of 17 hours/yr per respondentfor plants with benzene storage vessels under Approaches A, B, and C;(3) 126 averaged annual hours with an average of 1 hour/yr per respondentfor plants with benzene storage vessels under Approach D;(4) 1,383 averaged annual hours with an average of 11 hours/yr per respondentfor plants with equipment in benzene service (equipment leaks) under ApproachC;(5) 129 averaged annual hours with an average of 1 hour/yr per respondentfor plants with equipment in benzene service (equipment leaks) under ApproachD;(6) 7,112 averaged annual hours with an average of 161 hours/yr per respondentfor coke by-product recovery plants under Approaches A, B, and C each;and(7) 44 averaged annual hours with an average of 1 hour/yr per respondentfor coke by-product recovery plants under Approach D. Send comments regardingthe burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information,including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information PolicyBranch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW.,Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.There are no recordkeeping and reporting requirements for EB/S processvents under Approaches A, B, and C. Also, for equipment leaks under ApproachesA and B, the Agency proposes no change in the regulation, therefore, therewould be no additional recordkeeping and reporting burden.<ITAG tagnum="84">XV. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) requires EPA to consider potential impacts of proposedregulations on small ``entities.'' If a preliminary analysis indicatesthat a proposed regulation would have a significant economic impact on20 percent or more of small entities, then a regulatory flexibility analysismust be prepared. Present RFA guidelines indicate that an economic impact should be consideredsignificant if it meets one of the following criteria:(1) Compliance increases annual production costs by more than 5 percent;(2) Compliance costs as a percentage of sales for small entities are atleast 10 percent more than compliance costs as a percentage of sales forlarge entities;(3) Capital costs of compliance represent a ``significant'' portion ofcapital available to small entities, considering internal cash flow plusexternal financial capabilities; and(4) Regulatory requirements are likely to result in closures of small entities.For EB/S process vents, no small business would be subject to any proposedEB/S standard. For benzene storage vessels and equipment leaks, very fewbusinesses would be considered small businesses. According to Small BusinessAdministration guidelines, a small business that manufacturers cyclic crudesand cyclic intermediates, pharmaceuticals, and many other chemicals isone that has 750 employees or fewer. Very few of the businesses in theexisting industry employ fewer than 750 people. Even if benzene storagefacilities owned by small businesses do become subject to a standard underApproaches A, B, or C, none will be adversely affected. In the economicanalysis for this standard, the price increase and profitability impactswere estimated for small as well as for larger facilities. The impactsfor the small benzene storage facilities were very small (about $800/year).For benzene storage vessels under Approach D and for benzene equipmentleaks under Approaches C and D, small businesses will not be more adverselyaffected than larger businesses. For coke by-product recovery plants, the EPA has determined under the SmallBusiness Administration guidelines that any coke firm that employs fewerthan 1,000 workers is a small business. Six foundry coke firms were identifiedas being small. For the standard proposed under Approaches A, B, and C,the economic analysis estimates that one plant may exceed criterion (2)above. However, these standards are not subject to the RFA because thereis not a substantial number (i.e., 20 percent of the small businesses)that would be adversely affected. For standards proposed under ApproachD, the impacts are not expected to be more adverse for small businessesthan for large businesses. <ITAG tagnum="84">XVI. Public Hearing</ITAG>A public hearing will be held to discuss the proposed actions, in accordancewith sections 112(b)(1)(B) and 307(d)(5) of the CAA. Persons wishing tomake oral presentations should contact EPA at the address given in the<T2>ADDRESSES </T2>section of this preamble. Oral presentations will belimited to 10 minutes each. Any member of the public may file a writtenstatement before, during, or within 30 days of the hearing. Written statementsshould be addressed to the Central Docket Section address given in the<T2>ADDRESSES </T2>section of this preamble and should refer to DocketNo. A-79-16 for coke by-product recovery plants, Docket No. A-79-27 forbenzene equipment leaks, Docket No. OAQPS 79-3 (Part II) for maleic anhydrideprocess vents, Docket No. A-79-49 for EB/S process vents, and Docket No.A-80-14 for benzene storage vessels. A verbatim transcript of the hearing and written statements will be availablefor public inspection and copying during normal working hours at the EPA'sCentral Docket Section in Washington, DC (see <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>section of this preamble).<ITAG tagnum="84">XVII. Docket</ITAG>The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submittedto or otherwise considered by EPA in the development of this proposed rulemaking.The principal purposes of the docket are: (1) To allow interested partiesto identify and locate documents so that they can participate effectivelyin the rulemaking process and (2) to serve as the record in case of judicialreview (except for interagency review materials (section 307(d)(7)(A))).<ITAG tagnum="84">XVIII. Miscellaneous</ITAG>As prescribed by section 112 of the CAA, as amended, establishment of today'sproposed national emissions standards was preceded by the Administrator'slisting of benzene as a hazardous air pollutant on June 8, 1977 (42 FR29332). The final regulations will be reviewed 5 years from the dates of theirpromulgation. This review will include an assessment of such factors asthe need for integration with other programs, the existence of alternativemethods, enforceability, improvements in emission control technology andhealth data, and reporting requirements. In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication of these actionson benzene was preceded by consultation with appropriate advisory committees,independent experts, and Federal departments and agencies to the maximumextent practical. Under Executive Order 12291, EPA is required to judge whether this regulationis a ``major rule'' and therefore subject to certain requirements of theOrder. The EPA has determined that the regulations proposed for benzenestorage vessels under Approaches A, B, and C and for coke by-product recoveryplants under Approaches A and B will result in none of the adverse economiceffects set forth in section 1 of the Order as grounds for finding a regulationto be a ``major rule.'' These regulations are not major because: (1) Nationwideannual compliance costs are not as great as the threshold of $100 million;(2) the regulations do not significantly increase prices or productioncosts; and (3) the regulations do not cause significant, adverse effectson domestic competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or competition in foreign markets. The regulations proposed under Approach C for benzene equipment leaks andcoke by-product recovery plants and under Approach D for EB/S process vents,benzene storage vessels, equipment leaks and coke by-product plants maybe determined to be a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291. The regulationscould cause significant adverse effects on domestic competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or competition in foreign markets.As provided by section 8 of the Order, the Agency has not conducted a regulatoryimpact analysis (RIA) of these proposed regulations because of the timeconstraint of the judicially-ordered schedule. All of the proposed regulations presented in this notice were submittedto OMB for review as required by Executive Order 12291. Any written commentsfrom OMB to EPA and any written EPA response to those comments will beincluded in the dockets listed at the beginning of today's notice under``Dockets''. These dockets are available for public inspection at the EPA'sCentral Docket Section, which is listed in the <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>section of this preamble. Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that allthe rules proposed under Approaches A and B, the rules for benzene storagevessels and coke by-product recovery plants proposed under Approach C,and the rules for EB/S process vents proposed under Approach D, if promulgated,will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. I also hereby certify that the rules proposed under ApproachC for benzene equipment leaks and under Approach D for benzene storagevessels, equipment leaks, and coke by-product recovery plants will nothave a more adverse economic impact on small entities than on large entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 61</ITAG>Asbestos, Benzene, Beryllium, Coke oven emissions, Hazardous substances,Incorporation by reference, Inorganic arsenic, Inter-governmental relations,Mercury, Radionuclides, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Vinylchloride, Volatile hazardous air pollutants.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: July 20, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.
