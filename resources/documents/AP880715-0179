Even the State Department, usually sympathetic to the Saudis'pursuit of a modern military force, is showing some concern becausethe new air force Britain is providing and missiles from China arenot subject to the kind of constraints Washington would haveinsisted on.   The main rationale for the purchase of jet fighter planes,helicopters and mine-hunting ships from Britain andintermediate-range missiles from China is to counter Iran, whichfollows a muscular Moslem course at odds with the zealous butconservative Saudi royal dynasty.   But ironically, Iraq, which is fighting Iran in an eight-yearwar with financial help from the Saudis, may pose a longer-rangethreat to the kingdom, in the view of some analysts.   The Reagan administration has worked hard in Congress to clearU.S. weapons for the Saudis. The drive succeeded in 1981 when AWACSradar planes were approved after a bitter fight and failed in 1985when the purchase of 40 F-15 fighters was shelved undercongressional attack as a potential threat to Israel.   But when the Saudi missile sale from China surfaced this year,the State Department grumbled about the Saudis' unwillingness topermit inspection of the rockets.   The Chinese and the Saudis offered assurances the missiles wouldnot be made capable of carrying nuclear warheads, and Riyadh signedthe international treaty against nuclear proliferation, whichprovides for inspection.   When the Saudis struck a $17 billion deal with Britain thismonth for about 50 Tornado jet fighters, up to 60 Hawk jet traineraircraft, more than 60 Westland Black Hawk helicopters and sixminesweeping vessels, the State Department argued that the weaponspurchase _ one of the largest in history _ was not in the interestof the United States.   ``We think our interests are better served when we can selllegitimate self-defense items to friendly Arab countries, when wecan consult with them, when we can put the regulations, therestrictions on them that prevent threats to other countries,''spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said.   At the same time, the department has consistently rejected anysuggestion that the Saudis might turn their arsenal against Israel.The oil-rich state contributed money and at least token units inwars ainst the Jewish state and supported the Palestinian uprisingon the West Bank and in Gaza.   The U.S. constraints deny the Saudis some of the sophisticatedequipment that could make the weapons a bigger threat againstIsrael. Also, the Saudis are sometimes barred from placing theirweapons within easy striking distance of Israel.   The British apparently imposed no restrictions on the range orlocation of the weapons they are selling to the Saudis. The deal isa follow-up to a $9 billion British sale in 1985 and means Britainwill overtake the United States as the principal Saudi supplier.   At the same time, London still maintains an arms embargo imposedagainst Israel after the invasion of Lebanon in 1982.   Israeli officials have denounced the deal as regrettable,cynical and potentially threatening since the Saudis would be under``tremendous pressure'' to throw the weapons into the mix in theevent of another Middle East war.   Anthony Cordesman, a Middle East scholar who advises Sen. JohnMcCain, R-Ariz., on national security affairs, says the Saudibuildup implements a strategy devised a few years ago with theUnited States to construct an effective air force as a deterrent toattack from either Iran or Iraq.   Cordesman said the Saudis are buying billions of dollars of armsnot to threaten Israel, although the lack of constraints on theBritish arms poses a potential problem.   ``I don't think they are on a binge,'' he said. ``I think theyvery consistently have pursued the idea the only hope of having aneffective deterrent is to have an effective air force,'' he said.   From a strategic standpoint, Cordesman saw the United States andSaudi Arabia in a continuing ``partnership'' despite the purchasesfrom Britain and China. Only America can project the kind of powerin the Persian Gulf that would protect the Saudis in a majorcrisis, while the Saudis would provide bases and other help to theUnited States in wartime, he said.   W. Seth Carus, an adjunct scholar at the Washington Institutefor Near East Policy, traces the buildup to the royal family's tieswith the Saudi defense establishment and riots last year in theholy city of Mecca.   ``The Saudis consider themselves the guardians of the holyplaces,'' Carus said. ``The Iranians were saying, `You don't havethat right.' For the Saudis that was a declaration of war. TheSaudis found a real enemy.''   Shai Feldman, senior research associate at Israel's JaffeeCenter for Strategic Studies, said the Saudis face a potentialthreat from Iran during the current Persian Gulf war and from Iraqonce the war ends.   Iraq has built its army up to 28 to 30 divisions in the war withIran, and Saudi Arabia and the weaker gulf states ``are going toworry about the implications,'' he said.   Adding British Tornados to the air force means the Saudis willhave a jet fighter capable of low-level penetration, one that is``more offense-oriented than others,'' Feldman said.   ``That's the real reason some Israelis are worried,'' he said.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Barry Schweid covers diplomacy for The AssociatedPress.</TEXT></DOC>
