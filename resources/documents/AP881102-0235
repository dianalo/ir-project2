The findings were part of a survey of 2,847 Britons conducted in1987 by the independent Social and Community Planning Researchgroup, which has published reports on social attitudes annuallysince 1983.   ``Although we cannot be absolutely sure, it seems certain thatthere is a link between stricter morals and concern over the spreadof AIDS,'' said Sharon Witherspoon, a senior researcher and jointeditor of the report.   ``Our analysis shows that the type of person who tends to be lesssympathetic and more censorious toward AIDS sufferers is exactly thesame person who will be less liberal in their views on generalmatters of sexual morality.''.   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus thatdamages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible toinfections and cancer. It is most often spread through sexualcontact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected bloodor blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. AIDSis fatal, with no known cure.   The British survey found 74 percent of those polled thoughthomosexual relations were always or generally wrong, 12 percent morethan in 1983.   The number of those surveyed who thought sex before marriage waswrong rose from 23 percent in 1985 to 25 percent in 1987. Those whodisapproved of extramarital affairs rose from 83 percent in 1983 to88 percent last year.   Reseachers found ambivalent attitudes on AIDS. Although 57percent of respondents felt that ``most people with AIDS have onlythemselves to blame,'' about 60 percent believed that ``people whohave AIDS get much less sympathy from society than they ought toget.''   One-third of the respondents agreed more money should be spent onresearch into a cure for AIDS, but less than 10 percent thought moreshould be spent on care for AIDS victims.   That finding indicated ``a somewhat chilling lack of strongconcern for increasing the resources available for helpingsufferers,'' said Lindsay Brook, a senior researcher and co-editorof the book.   The survey found that 60 percent of those polled believedteen-agers under 16 should not be given contraceptives, 10 percentmore than in 1983.   The authors said the survey was carried out on a random sample ofpeople living in all areas of Britain except Northern Ireland.Interviews were conducted at respondents' homes.</TEXT></DOC>
