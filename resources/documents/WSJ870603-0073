The Beaverton, Ore., maker of highpowered computers for scientific and engineering applications estimated the cost of restructuring will be a one-time charge of $5 million to $10 million for the third quarter ending July 31.    James Richardson, vice president, finance and administration, said the charge will be &quot;closer to $10 million.&quot; Floating Point plans a &quot;significant&quot; reduction in its facility in Ireland, one of its two manufacturing sites, where it had excess capacity. The cost cuts will save the company $16 million to $20 million a year, Mr. Richardson said.    Because of the restructuring charge, &quot;it seems unlikely&quot; that Floating Point will post profit this year, Milton Smith, chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview. For the year ended Oct. 31, Floating Point posted a loss of $14.3 million on revenue of $88.6 million.    Mr. Smith wouldn't predict results for the current quarter. In the year-earlier quarter, Floating Point posted a loss of $2.9 million on revenue of $20.1 million.    When the staff cuts become effective June 15, Floating Point will have about half as many employees as it did at this time last year. Mr. Smith said that while revenue has remained fairly stable for the past five quarters, expense levels were &quot;out of line.&quot; Expenses were set in anticipation of sales that never materialized, he said. Sales across the board &quot;hadn't gone as strongly as we'd hoped,&quot; he added.    He cited increased competition and softness in the overall computer market, and said that customers are demanding more computing power for their dollar, forcing down profit margins. There &quot;will be a shakeout&quot; among makers of supercomputers and minisupercomputers, he said, but Floating Point &quot;will be a survivor&quot; partly because of its large installed base.    Last fall, the company cut salaries 10% to trim costs. Remaining employees had their salaries reinstated in full as of Monday, however. Mr. Smith said he expects research and development spending will decline slightly from the $18 million last year, but he wouldn't be specific.    Also last year, Floating Point was hit with two investor lawsuits, claiming the company misled investors about its supercomputers, undeservedly inflating its stock price. The company has denied the charges.    Unemployment in Oregon, where Floating Point is a major employer, was 5.3% in May. </TEXT></DOC>
