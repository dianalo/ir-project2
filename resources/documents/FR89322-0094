(``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with theSecurities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposedrule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which items havebeen prepared by the Amex. The Commission is publishing this notice tosolicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substanceof the Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>The Amex is proposing to amend Exchange policy to permit a member firmaffiliated with an options specialist to conduct an upstairs over-the-counter(``OTC'') market making business in the stock underlying the specialtyoption, and to revise its Chinese Wall guidelines (Rule 193 Commentary)to reflect and accommodate this change. The Exchange also is proposingto amend Rule 950 to clarify the general prohibition on such market makingactivity. The text of the proposed rule change follows as Exhibit A tothis notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerningthe purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed anycomments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statementsmay be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex hasprepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of themost significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-regulatory organization's statement of the purpose of, and thestatutory basis for, the proposed rule change <ITAG tagnum="81">(1) Purpose </ITAG>In 1986, the Exchange adopted rules and procedures designed to facilitatediversified members firms' participation in the specialist business whileensuring a functional separation (known as a ``Chinese Wall'') betweenthe specialist and the member firm's other activities. The Chinese Wallprocedures adopted by the Exchange, however, did not provide for ``integratedmarket making'' of stocks and options (the trading of individual optionsand their underlying stocks by different areas within the same firm). Integratedmarket making has traditionally been considered a form of ``side-by-side''trading, which, since the inception of listed stock options, the SEC andthe options exchanges have opposed, based on concerns regarding the potentialfor abuse. While integrated market making involving Amex listed stocks and Amex tradedoptions will continue to be prohibited, the Exchange is proposing to amendits policy to permit member firms affiliated with Exchange options specialiststo act as upstairs OTC market makers in stocks underlying the specialtyoptions, provided satisfactory Chinese Wall procedures between the specialistunit and upstairs firm are established and approved by the Exchange. TheChinese Wall must be designed to prohibit the upstairs firm from furnishingmarket or corporate information to, or otherwise influence particular tradingdecisions of, its affiliated specialist unit, and to prevent the misuseof specialist market information by the upstairs firm. In addition, thespecialist organization and its affiliated upstairs firm must develop proceduresto ensure that there is no communication between the OTC market maker participatingin the National Association of Securities Dealers' Automated QuotationSystem (``NASDAQ'') and the specialist in connection with the executionof proprietary transactions by the market maker in the overlying optionor by the specialist in the underlying stock. To clarify the general Exchange policy that without satisfactory ChineseWall procedures, a member firm affiliated with an Exchange option specialistmay not engage in OTC market making activity in the stock underlying aspecialty option, it is also proposed that a new subparagraph be addedto Exchange Rule 950 specifically setting forth this prohibition. <ITAG tagnum="81">(2) Basis </ITAG>The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act ingeneral and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular inthat it is designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanismof a free and open market. B. Self-regulatory organization's statement on burden on competition The proposed rule change will impose no burden on competition. C. Self-regulatory organization's statement on comments on the proposedrule change received from members, participants or others No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposedrule change. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timingfor Commission Action </ITAG>Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>or within such longer period (i) As the Commissionmay designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer periodto be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as towhich the Amex consents, the Commission will: (A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or (B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule changeshould be disapproved.  <ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
