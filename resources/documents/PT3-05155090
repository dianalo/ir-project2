More      particularly, it relates to a thermal transfer image receiving material      which is excellent in manufacturability, gives a high transfer density,      does not cause fusion by heat and gives an image of excellent quality. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Various information processing systems have been developed as a result of      the rapid development which has taken place in the information industry in      recent years. Methods of recording and apparatus compatible with these      information processing systems have been developed and adopted. Thermal      transfer recording methods, i.e., recording methods of this type, involve      the use of an apparatus which is light and compact, with which there is      little noise, and which has excellent operability and maintenance      characteristics. Moreover, since they also allow coloring to be achieved      easily, these methods are the most widely used. Thermal transfer recording      methods can be broadly classified into two types, namely, thermofusion      types and thermomobile types. In the latter case, a thermal transfer dye      providing material which has, on a support, a dye providing layer which      contains a binder and a thermomobile dye is laminated with a thermal      transfer image receiving material, heat is applied from the support side      of the dye providing material, the thermomobile dye is transferred to the      recording medium (thermal transfer image receiving material) in the form      of a pattern corresponding to the heat pattern which has been applied and      an image is formed. </PAR><PAR>  Moreover, a thermomobile dye is, for example, a dye which can be      transferred from a thermal transfer dye providing material to a thermal      transfer image receiving material by sublimation or diffusion in a medium. </PAR><PAR>  However, the following disadvantages are encountered with thermal transfer      image receiving materials in which the thermomobile type thermal transfer      recording method is employed. </PAR><PAR>  The polymers used in the receiving layer for the thermomobile dye are      soluble in organic solvents and so an organic solvent system is used for      the receiving layer coating liquid. Furthermore, the apparatus and vessels      used , in the manufacturing process must be cleaned with organic solvents.      Hence, the apparatus used for preparing the coating liquid and the coating      apparatus must be explosion-proof. Furthermore, organic solvents are very      expensive when compared to water and so the production costs are      increased. Moreover, problems can arise with the health supervision of the      operators. As stated above, conventional thermal transfer image materials      using organic solvents have various problems with regard to the      adoptability for the production thereof. </PAR><PAR>  Various attempts have been made to obtain an image having a high transfer      density in the thermomobile type thermal transfer image receiving method. </PAR><PAR>  For example, JP-A-60-38192 (the term &quot;JP-A&quot; as used herein means an      &quot;unexamined published Japanese patent application&quot;) discloses the use of      latexes of dye accepting polymers as coating solutions for the image      receiving layer. However, the resulting image is not considered to be      satisfying with respect to transfer density, because the transfer density      is low. Further, when the thermal transfer image receiving material is      placed on the thermal transfer dye providing material and heat is applied      thereto to transfer the thermomobile dye from the dye providing material      to the image receiving material in the method described in the above      patent specification, problems are often caused in that both materials are      fused together by heat, and the dye providing layer of the dye providing      material is peeled off and stuck on the transfer surface of the image      receiving material, or conveying is sometimes made impossible and the      printer is stopped. These troubles are caused particularly when the      applied voltage is raised and thermal transfer is carried out at high      temperatures to obtain a sufficient transfer density. Further, when      additives are used to increase the transfer density of the thermal      transfer image receiving material or to prevent heat fusion from being      caused, it has been found that the image quality of the image receiving      material is liable to be deteriorated. </PAR><PAR>  JP-A-57-137191, JP-A-57-91296 and JP-A-60-38192 disclose that the      dispersions of the latexes of dye accepting polymers in polyvinyl alcohol      (PVA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) or hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) are      used as coating solutions for the image receiving layer to improve image      density. It has been found that an effect of improving image density is      somewhat obtained. However, the effect is low and insufficient. </PAR><PAR>  The present inventors have made studies to solve the above-described      problems caused when the organic solvent solutions of the dye accepting      materials are coated. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  An object of the present invention is to provide a thermal transfer image      receiving material which is freed from the problems associated with the      prior art and gives an image having a high transfer density. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the present invention is to provide a thermal transfer      image receiving material which has improved properties with regard to the      problem of the heat fusion of the image receiving material with the dye      providing material during thermal transfer. </PAR><PAR>  The above-described objects of the present invention have been achieved by      providing a thermal transfer image receiving material comprising a support      capable of accepting a dye which migrates from a thermal transfer dye      providing material when heated, to form an image, wherein the image      receiving layer is formed by coating a coating solution and drying it, the      coating solution being obtained by dispersing an aqueous dispersion of      fine particles of a dye accepting polymer and a high-boiling organic      solvent and/or a thermal solvent in a water-soluble binder solution. </PAR><PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In the present invention, the organic solvent solution of the dye accepting      substance is not coated as in the past, but the dye accepting substance is      dispersed in a water-soluble binder and coated. Accordingly, coating can      be carried out by using water as a solvent in the present invention. Thus,      there is no risk of explosion, the manufacturing costs can be markedly      reduced and adverse effects on operator health are greatly reduced. </PAR><PAR>  Further, when the image receiving layer is prepared by dispersing the      high-boiling organic solvent or thermal solvent in an aqueous dispersion      of fine particles of the dye accepting polymer without using the      water-soluble binder, coating the resulting coating solution and drying      it, the film of the image receiving layer becomes sticky and fusion by      heat is liable to be caused during thermal transfer, while when the image      receiving layer is prepared by dispersing an aqueous dispersion of fine      particles of the dye accepting polymer and the dye accepting high-boiling      organic solvent and/or thermal solvent in the water-soluble binder      solution, coating the resulting coating solution and drying it as in the      present invention, the image receiving layer can sufficiently accept the      thermomobile dye, an image having a high transfer density can be obtained,      and the problem of fusion by heat during thermal transfer is eliminated.      This is an unexpected finding. </PAR><PAR>  Furthermore, when the dye image receiving layer is composed of two or more      multi-layers, the coating-drying stage must be repeated several times in      the methods using conventional organic solvent coating solutions. In the      present invention, the coating solution for the image receiving layer is      the water-soluble binder solution and by which simultaneous multilayer      coating can be accomplished. Accordingly, the present invention has      advantages in that the manufacturing process can be shortened and the      manufacturing cost can be reduced. </PAR><PAR>  Now, the present invention will be illustrated in more detail below. </PAR><PAR>  The thermal transfer image receiving material of the present invention is      provided with an image receiving layer capable of accepting a dye. The      image receiving layer contains a dye accepting substance carried thereon      and dispersed in a water-soluble binder, the dye accepting substance      having a function capable of accepting a thermomobile dye migrating from a      thermal transfer dye, providing material during printing and allowing the      thermomobile dye to be deposited. </PAR><PAR>  In the present invention, the image receiving layer is prepared by      dispersing an aqueous dispersion of the fine particles of the dye      accepting polymer and the dye accepting high-boiling organic solvent      and/or thermal solvent in the water-soluble binder solution, coating the      resulting coating solution and drying it. </PAR><PAR>  Examples of the coating solution for the image receiving layer, which can      be used in the present invention, include: </PAR><PAR>  (a) a composition obtained by emulsifying and dispersing (1) an aqueous      dispersion of the fine particles of the dye accepting polymer and (2) the      dye accepting high-boiling organic solvent and/or thermal solvent, or a      low-boiling organic solvent solution of them, in water or an aqueous      solution of a water-soluble polymer and then mixing the resulting      dispersion with (3) an aqueous solution of the water-soluble binder; </PAR><PAR>  (b) a composition obtained by using a mixed solution of (1) an aqueous      dispersion of the fine particles of the dye accepting polymer and (3) an      aqueous solution of the water-soluble binder as a dispersion medium and      emulsifying and dispersing (2) the dye accepting high-boiling organic      solvent and/or thermal solvent, or a low-boiling organic solvent solution      of them, in the mixed solution; and </PAR><PAR>  (c) a composition obtained by dispersing (1) an aqueous solution of the      fine particles of the dye accepting polymer and (2) the dye accepting      high-boiling organic solvent and/or thermal solvent in an aqueous solution      of the water-soluble binder, without using a low-boiling organic solvent      solution, and then mixing the resulting dispersion with (3) an aqueous      solution of the water-soluble binder. </PAR><PAR>  The aqueous solution of the fine particles of the dye accepting polymer      which is used in the present invention is a dispersion of the fine      particles of the dye accepting polymer in water. The fine particles of the      polymer have a particle diameter of preferably not larger than 5 .mu.m.      More preferably, the polymer is in the form of a latex (particle diameter      of not larger than 1 .mu.m). </PAR><PAR>  Examples of the aqueous solution of the fine particles of the dye accepting      polymer include those obtained by dissolving a dye accepting polymer in an      organic solvent, emulsifying and dispersing the resulting solution in      water and removing the organic solvent; and latexes obtained by emulsion      polymerizing a dye accepting polymer. </PAR><PAR>  Examples of the dye accepting polymer include the following resins. </PAR><PAR>  (I) Resins having an ester linkage </PAR><PAR>  Polyester resins obtained by the condensation of a dicarboxylic acid      component such as terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid or succinic acid      (the dicarboxylic acid component may be substituted by a sulfo group, a      carboxyl group, etc.) with ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene      glycol, neopentyl glycol, bisphenol A or the like; polyacrylate resins and      polymethacrylate resins such as polymethyl methacrylate, polybutyl      methacrylate, polymethyl acrylate and polybutyl acrylate; polycarbonate      resins; polyvinyl acetate resins; styrene-acrylate resins; vinyltoluene      acrylate resins, etc. More specifically, examples of the resins are      described in JP-A-59-101395, JP-A-63-7971, JP-A-63-7972, JP-A 63-7973 and      JP-A-60-294862. Examples of commercially available resins which can be      used in the present invention include Vylon 290, Vylon 200, Vylon 280,      Vylon 300, Vylon 103, Vylon GK-140 and Vylon GK-130 (products of Toyobo      Co., Ltd.) and ATR-2009 and ATR-2010 (products of Kao Corporation). </PAR><PAR>  (II) Resins having an urethane linkage </PAR><PAR>  Polyurethane resins, etc. </PAR><PAR>  (III) Resins having an amido linkage </PAR><PAR>  Polyamide resins, etc. </PAR><PAR>  (IV) Resins having an urea linkage </PAR><PAR>  Urea resins, etc. </PAR><PAR>  (V) Resins having a sulfone linkage </PAR><PAR>  Polysulfone resins, etc. </PAR><PAR>  (VI) Resins having linkages with high polarity </PAR><PAR>  Polycaprolactone resins, styrene-maleic anhydride resins, polyvinyl      chloride resins, polyacrylonitrile resins, etc. </PAR><PAR>  In addition to the above-described synthetic resins, mixtures thereof and      copolymers thereof can also be used. </PAR><PAR>  Examples of the aqueous solution of the fine particles of the dye accepting      polymer which is commercially available include Vylonal MD-1200 (a product      of Toyobo Co., Ltd.) and Pesresin (a product of Takamatsu Yushi KK). </PAR><PAR>  Now, the dye accepting high-boiling organic solvent and/or thermal solvent      will be illustrated in detail below. </PAR><PAR>  Examples of the high-boiling organic solvent include compounds such as      esters (e.g., phthalic esters, phosphoric esters, fatty acid esters),      amides (e.g., fatty acid amides, sulfonamides), ethers, alcohols,      paraffins and silicone oils as described in JP-A-59-83154,      JP-A-59-178451, JP-A-59-178452, JP-A-59-178453, JP-A-59-178454,      JP-A-59-178455, and JP-A-59-178457. </PAR><PAR>  As the thermal solvent, there can be used compounds having such properties      that (1) the compounds are compatible with dyes, (2) the compounds are      solids at room temperature and can be molten (may be molten by aid of      other component mixed therewith) when heated by a thermal head during      transfer and (3) the compounds are not decomposed when heated by a thermal      head. Compounds having a melting point of 35.degree. to 250.degree. C.,      particularly 35.degree. to 200.degree. C., are preferred. </PAR><PAR>  Compounds having an (organic character/inorganic character) value      .gtoreq.2, preferably 2 or more but less than 6, are preferred as the      high-boiling organic solvents and the thermal solvents. If the (organic      character/inorganic character) value is less than 2, the dispersibility is      poor, and the surface gloss of the image receiving material is lowered. On      the other hand, if it is 6 or more, the increasing effect of transfer      density is little. The terms &quot;organic character&quot; and &quot;inorganic character&quot;      as used herein refer to a conception for foreseeing the properties of      compounds. The details thereof are described in Field of Chemistry, 11,      page 719 (1957). </PAR><PAR>  Examples of the high-boiling organic solvents and thermal solvents are      included compounds described in JP-A-62-174754, JP-A-62-245253,      JP-A-61-209444, JP-A-61-200538, JP-A-62-8145, JP-A-62-9348, JP-A-62-30247      and JP-A-62-136646. </PAR><PAR>  More specifically, examples of the high-boiling organic solvents and      thermal solvents include, but are not limited to, the following compounds.      The (organic character/inorganic character) values of these compounds are      also listed in the parentheses together with the formulae of these      compounds below.      ##STR1## </PAR><PAR>  Among these compounds, Compounds 1 to 22, 24, 26 to 31 and 39 can be used      as the thermal solvent; and Compounds 23, 25 and 32 to 38 can be used as      the high-boiling organic solvent, respectively. </PAR><PAR>  The above-described high-boiling organic solvents and thermal solvents may      be used for the purpose of improving slipperiness, releasability and curl      balance. </PAR><PAR>  The image receiving layer of the thermal transfer image receiving material      of the present invention comprises the dye accepting substance dispersed      in the water-soluble binder. Any of the conventional water-soluble      polymers can be used as the water-soluble binder. However, water-soluble      polymers having a group capable of crosslinking in the presence of a      hardening agent are preferred. </PAR><PAR>  Examples of the water-soluble polymers which can be used in the present      invention include vinyl polymers and derivatives thereof such as polyvinyl      alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl pyridinium and cationic modified      polyvinyl alcohol (described in JP-A-60-145879, JP-A-60-220750,      JP-A-61-143177, JP-A-61-235182, JP-A 61-245183, JP-A-61-237681 and      JP-A-61-261089); polymers having an acrylic group such as polyacrylamide,      polydimethyl acrylamide, polydimethylamino acrylate, polyacrylic acid and      salts thereof, acrylic acid-methacrylic acid copolymers and salts thereof,      polymethacrylic acid and salts thereof and acrylic acidvinyl alcohol      copolymers and salts thereof (described in JP-A 60-168651 and      JP-A-62-9988); natural polymers and derivatives thereof such as starch,      oxidized starch, acetyl starch, amine starch, carboxyl starch, dialdehyde      starch, cationic starch, dextrin, sodium alginate, gelatin, gum arabic,      casein, pullulan, dextran, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose,      carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl      cellulose (described in JP-A-59-174382, JP-A-60-262685, JP-A-61-143177,      JP-A-61-181679, JP-A-61-193879 and JP-A-61-287782); synthetic polymers      such as polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyvinylmethyl ether,      maleic acid-vinyl acetate copolymer, maleic acid-N-vinylpyrrolidone      copolymer, maleic acid-alkylvinyl ether copolymers and polyethyleneimine      (described in JP-A-61-32787, JP-A-61- 237680 and JP-A-61-277483); and      water-polymers described in JP-A-56-58869. </PAR><PAR>  Copolymers which are solubilized in water by monomers having an      SO.sub.3.sup..crclbar. group, a COO.sup..crclbar. group, an      SO.sub.2.sup..crclbar. group or the like can be used. </PAR><PAR>  It is particularly preferred that gelatin is used as the water-soluble      binder, because set drying is possible and hence the drying load can be      greatly reduced and simultaneous multi-layer coating can be easily carried      out. Examples of gelatin include gelatin and derivatives thereof such as      lime-processed gelatin, lime-processed gelatin having been subjected to a      calcium removal treatment, acid-processed gelatin, phthalated gelatin,      acetylated gelatin and succinated gelatin; and enzyme-processed gelatin,      hydrolyzates of gelatin and enzymatic hydrolyzates of gelatin described in      Bull. Soc. Phot. Japan, No. 16, p. 30 (1966). </PAR><PAR>  These water-soluble polymers may be used either alone or in a combination      of two or more of them. </PAR><PAR>  The water-soluble binder and the finely divided dye accepting polymer are      used in a weight ratio of the dye accepting polymer to the water soluble      polymer of from 1 to 20, preferably from 2 to 10, particularly preferably      from 2.5 to 7. </PAR><PAR>  The dye accepting high-boiling organic solvent and/or thermal solvent      are/is used in an amount of 1 to 300% by weight, preferably 10 to 200% by      weight, particularly preferably 30 to 150% by weight, based on the amount      of the water soluble binder. </PAR><PAR>  The dye accepting substance can be dispersed in the water-soluble binder by      any of the conventional dispersion methods for dispersing hydrophobic      substances in water-soluble polymers. Typical examples thereof include a      method wherein a solution of the dye accepting substance dissolved in a      water immiscible organic solvent is mixed with an aqueous solution of the      water-soluble binder to carry out emulsification and dispersion, and a      method wherein a latex of the dye accepting polymer is mixed with an      aqueous solution of the water-soluble binder. </PAR><PAR>  The image receiving layer may be composed of one layer or two or more      layers. When the image receiving layer is composed of two or more layers,      it is preferred that a synthetic resin having a lower glass transition      point or the high-boiling organic solvent or thermal solvent is used for      the image receiving layer closer to the support to increase dyeability      with the dye and a synthetic resin having a higher glass transition point      or a fluoro-compound is used for the outermost layer to minimize the      amount of the high-boiling organic solvent or thermal solvent, whereby      troubles such as sticking on the surface of the layer, adhesion to other      substances, re-transfer of transferred dye to other substance and blocking      with the thermal transfer dye providing material are prevented from being      caused. It is preferred that the release agent described hereinafter is      incorporated in the outermost layer. </PAR><PAR>  The total thickness of the image receiving layer is in the range of      preferably 0.5 to 50 .mu.m, particularly preferably 3 to 30 .mu.m. When      the image receiving layer is composed of two or more layers, the thickness      of the outermost layer is in the range of preferably 0.1 to 3 .mu.m,      particularly preferably 0.2 to 1.5 .mu.m. </PAR><PAR>  Any of the supports conventionally used for thermal transfer image      receiving materials can be used in the present invention without      particular limitation. Materials in which thermomobile dyes are highly      diffusible can be used as the supports in the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  Examples of the supports include (1) synthetic paper (e.g., polyolefin or      polystyrene synthetic paper), (2) paper supports such as wood-free paper,      art paper, coated paper, cast coated paper, wall paper, backing paper,      synthetic resin or emulsion-impregnated paper, synthetic rubber      latex-impregnated paper, paper containing a synthetic resin internally      added, cardboard, cellulose fiber paper and polyolefin-coated paper      (particularly paper whose both sides are coated with polyethylene); and      (3) plastic films or sheets such as films or sheets of polyolefins,      polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, methacrylates      and polycarbonates and films or sheets thereof having been treated to      impart white color reflecting properties. </PAR><PAR>  Laminates composed of a combination of two or more of the above materials      (1) to (3) can be used. </PAR><PAR>  Among them, polyolefin-coated paper is preferred, because the      polyolefin-coated paper does not cause recessed deformation by heat during      thermal transfer, has excellent whiteness and scarcely causes curling. </PAR><PAR>  Polyolefin-coated paper is described in, for example, Foundation of      Photographic Engineering (Silver Salt Photography Part), pp. 223-240      (1979) (published by Corona). The polyolefin-coated paper comprises      basically a support sheet and a polyolefin layer coated on the support      sheet. The support sheet is composed of a material other than synthetic      resins and is generally composed of wood-free paper. A polyolefin coat may      be provided by any method, so long as the polyolefin layer adheres closely      to the surface of the support sheet. However, the polyolefin coat is      generally provided by extrusion coating. The polyolefin layer may be      provided only on the surface of the image receiving layer side of the      support sheet. If desired, the polyolefin layer may be provided on both      sides of the support sheet. Any of the high-density polyethylenes, low      density polyethylenes and polypropylenes can be used as the polyolefin.      However, it is preferred from the viewpoint of heat insulation effect that      low-density polyethylenes having a low thermal conductivity are used for      the side on which the image receiving layer is provided. </PAR><PAR>  There is no particular limitation with regard to the thickness of the      polyolefin coat. However, the thickness of one side is preferably 5 to 100      .mu.m. It is preferred that the thickness of the polyolefin coat on the      image receiving layer side is thinner to obtain a higher transfer density. </PAR><PAR>  A pigment such as titanium oxide or ultramarine or a filler may be added to      the polyolefin coat to increase whiteness. A thin gelatin layer in a      coating weight of about 0.05 to 0.4 g/m.sup.2 may be provided on the      surface (the side on which the image receiving layer is provided and/or      the back side thereof) of polyolefin-coated paper. </PAR><PAR>  The thermal transfer image receiving layer of the present invention may be      provided with an interlayer with or without a water-soluble binder between      the support and the image receiving layer. </PAR><PAR>  The interlayer may be a cushioning layer, a porous layer or a layer for      preventing the dye from diffusing depending on the qualities of the      materials which constitute the interlayer. The interlayer may be a layer      having two or more functions. If desired, the interlayer may have a      function as an adhesive in addition to the above functions. </PAR><PAR>  The layer for preventing the dye from diffusing plays a role in preventing      the thermomobile dye in particular from diffusing into the support. Any of      the water-soluble binders or organic solvent-soluble binders may be used      as a binder for the diffusion preventing layer. However, the water-soluble      binder is preferred. Examples of the water soluble binder include those      for the image receiving layer. Gelatin is particularly preferred. </PAR><PAR>  The porous layer is a layer which prevents the heat applied during thermal      transfer from diffusing from the image receiving layer into the support to      effectively utilize the heat applied. </PAR><PAR>  When the water-soluble binder is used as the binder for the porous layer,      the layer can be formed by (1) a method wherein porous fine particles are      dispersed in a water-soluble polymer and the dispersion is coated and      dried; (2) a method wherein a solution of a water-soluble polymer is      mechanically stirred to form bubbles and the solution is coated and dried;      (3) a method wherein a blowing agent is added to a water-soluble polymer      solution and the solution is foamed before coating and then coated or the      solution is foamed during the course of coating and drying; or (4) a      method wherein an organic solvent (preferably a solvent having a boiling      point higher than that of water) is emulsified and dispersed in a      water-soluble polymer solution and microvoids are formed during the course      of coating and drying. </PAR><PAR>  When the organic solvent-soluble binder is used as the binder for the      porous layer, the layer can be formed, for example, by (1) a method      wherein an emulsion of a synthetic resin such as polyurethane or a      synthetic rubber latex such as methyl methacrylate-butadiene rubber latex      is mechanically stirred to form bubbles and the resulting liquid is coated      on the support and dried; (2) a method wherein a blowing agent is mixed      with the above-described synthetic resin emulsion or synthetic rubber      latex and the resulting liquid is coated on the support and dried; (3) a      method wherein a blowing agent is mixed with a synthetic resin such as      vinyl chloride plastisol or polyurethane or a synthetic rubber such as      styrene-butadiene rubber and the resulting liquid is coated on the support      and dried; or (4) a method wherein a solution of a thermoplastic resin or      a synthetic rubber dissolved in an organic solvent is mixed with a      non-solvent (including a non-solvent mainly composed of water) which      evaporates difficultly in comparison with the organic solvent, is      compatible with the organic solvent and does not dissolve the      thermoplastic resin or synthetic rubber, and the resulting mixed solution      is coated on the support and dried to form a microporous layer. </PAR><PAR>  When the image receiving layer is provided on both sides of the support,      the interlayer may be provided on both sides thereof or on only one side      thereof. The thickness of the interlayer is 0.5 to 50 .mu.m, particularly      preferably 1 to 20 .mu.m. </PAR><PAR>  The image receiving layer, the cushioning layer, the porous layer, the      diffusion preventing layer and the adhesive layer which constitute the      thermal transfer image receiving material of the present invention may      contain a fine powder of silica, clay, talc, diatomaceous earth, calcium      carbonate, calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, aluminum silicate, synthetic      zeolite, zinc oxide, lithopone, titanium oxide or alumina. </PAR><PAR>  The thermal transfer image receiving material may contain fluorescent      brighteners. Examples thereof include compounds described in K.      Veenkataraman, The Chemistry of Synthetic Dyes, Vol. 5, 8th chapter and      JP-A-61-143752. More specifically, examples of the fluorescent brighteners      include stilbene compounds, coumarin compounds, biphenyl compounds,      benzoxazolyl compounds, naphthalimide compounds, pyrazoline compounds,      carbostyryl compounds and 2,5-benzoxazolethiophene compounds. </PAR><PAR>  The fluorescent brighteners may be used in combination with anti-fading      agents. </PAR><PAR>  The thermal transfer dye providing material comprises a support having      thereon a thermal transfer layer containing a thermomobile dye. Recording      is made by applying heat thereto and allowing the dye in the form of a      pattern to migrate into the image receiving layer of the thermal transfer      image receiving material. </PAR><PAR>  Any of the conventional supports can be used as the supports for the      thermal transfer dye providing material. Examples of the supports include      polyethylene terephthalate, polyamides, polycarbonates, glassine paper,      condenser paper, cellulose esters, fluoropolymers, polyethers,      polyacetals, polyolefins, polyimides, polyphenylene sulfide,      polypropylene, polysulfone and cellophane. </PAR><PAR>  The support of the thermal transfer dye providing material has generally a      thickness of from 2 to 30 .mu.m. If desired, the support may be provided      with a subbing layer. A layer for preventing the dye from diffusing, which      is composed of a hydrophilic polymer, may be provided between the support      and the dye providing layer, whereby transfer density can be further      improved. The above-described water-soluble polymers can be used as      hydrophilic polymers for the diffusion preventing layer. </PAR><PAR>  A stripping layer may be provided to prevent the dye providing material      from being stuck on the thermal head. The stripping layer comprises a      lubricating substance which contains or does not contain a polymer binder,      such as a surfactant, a solid or liquid lubricant or a mixture thereof. </PAR><PAR>  The dye providing layer contains a dye which is chosen so as to allow a      desired hue to be transferred when printed. If desired, two or more dye      providing layers having different dyes may be arranged on one thermal      transfer dye providing material. For example, when an image like a color      photograph is formed by repeatedly making printing having each color      according to progressive signals, it is desirable that printed hues have      each color of cyan, magenta and yellow and three dye providing layers      containing dyes giving such hues are arranged. If desired, a dye providing      layer containing a dye giving a black hue may be arranged in addition to      the dye providing layers containing dyes giving cyan, magenta and yellow      hues. It is preferred that when these dye providing layers are formed, a      mark for position detection is provided simultaneously with the formation      of any one of these layers, because extra inking or printing stage other      than the formation of the dye providing layers is not required. </PAR><PAR>  The thermal transfer dye providing material using the thermomobile dye      comprises basically a support having thereon a thermal transfer layer      containing a binder and a dye which sublimes or is made mobile by heat.      The thermal transfer dye providing material can be obtained by dissolving      or dispersing the conventional dye (which sublimes or is made mobile by      heat) and a binder resin in an appropriate solvent, coating the resulting      coating solution on one side of the support for the thermal transfer dye      providing material in such an amount as to give a dry thickness of about      0.2 to 5 .mu.m, preferably 0.4 to 2 .mu.m, and drying the coated support      to form a thermal transfer layer. </PAR><PAR>  Any of the dyes conventionally used for the thermal transfer dye providing      material can be used as dyes for use in the formation of the thermal      transfer layer. However, dyes having a low molecular weight of about 150      to 800 are particularly preferred in the present invention. Dyes to be      used are chosen by taking transfer temperature, hue, light resistance,      solubility or dispersibility in inks and binder resins, etc. into      consideration. </PAR><PAR>  Examples of the dyes include disperse dyes, basic dyes and oil-soluble      dyes. Particularly preferred dyes are Sumikaron Yellow E4GL, Dianix Yellow      H2G-FS, Miketon Polyster Yellow 3GSL, Kayaset Yellow 937, Sumikaron Red      EFBL, Dianix Red ACE, Miketon Polyester Red FB, Kayaset Red 126, Miketon      First Brilliant Blue B and Kayaset 136.
