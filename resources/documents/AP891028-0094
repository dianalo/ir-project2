Christopher Shays,R-Conn. ``We didn't nail down and expose what I think was aconspiracy to defraud the government.'''   The investigation by the Government Operations subcommittee onemployment and housing began in April after a Department of Housingand Urban Development report found that a rehabilitation programwas being milked for millions of dollars in excess rents and thatsubsidies apparently had been steered to developers who hiredwell-connected consultants.   In 24 hearings the panel was told how HUD failed to keep trackof millions of dollars, mismanaged programs and gave favoredtreatment to those with agency or political connections.   But the refusal of former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. andthree of his top deputies to answer questions about their rolesleft a gaping hole in the investigation and also effectively endedit. Only a few more hearings are expected before the investigationis closed.   The question of whether there was criminal activity was left tothe Justice Department. Justice Department spokesman David Runkelsaid Friday that investigations are ongoing.   ``We have more than 700 open cases that involve up to 1,000individuals or companies,'' he said. ``These are high priorityitems and will continue to be until this HUD mess is cleaned up.''   But Runkel said Attorney General Dick Thornburgh opposescongressional efforts to get him to name a special prosecutor toinvestigate HUD.   Federal authorities have in recent months reviewed recordscompiled by HUD's inspector general and the subcomittee, andseveral grand jury investigations are known to exist.   The only way for the subcommittee investigation to makesignificant progress would be to secure the testimony of one ormore of the former HUD officials who refused to testify, members ofthe panel said. The only way to do that, it appears, would be togrant immunity.   The panel's chairman, Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said Friday hehad no current plans to offer immunity to anyone but said he hadnot ruled it out in the future.   Lantos appears to lack the support on the panel he would needfor such a move.   ``I have no intention of playing God and trying to decide whoshould and who shouldn't be granted immunity,'' said Shays.   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said immunity was ``a very sensitivesubject'' and should only be granted if approved by prosecutors.   One member of the panel, speaking on the condition of anonymity,said preliminary discussions with two of the former Pierce aidesabout immunity had convinced him they would provide too littleevidence to make it worthwhile.   Even Lantos, who has appeared to relish his role in leading thetelevised hearings, conceded the decisions by Pierce and others notto answer questions effectively brought the subcommitteeinvestigation to a halt.   ``The subcommittee has finished the bulk of its work,'' he said.   That work included public testimony from 50 witnesses, staffinterviews with scores more and occasional theatrics.   With one notable exception, the former HUD officials,consultants, closing agents and attorneys called before the panelto discuss their activities said they had done nothing wrong.   The exception was Marilyn Harrell, better known as ``RobinHUD,'' who wept and read from Scripture as she told how she easilystole more than $5 million from HUD during her work as a closingagent on property sales and gave some of it to the needy. She saidshe deserved to be punished and promised to repay.   Other witnesses, however, defended their HUD-related activities,which including reaping fees of up to $1.3 million for lobbying HUDon behalf of developers.   Paul Manafort, a prominent Republican consultant, conceded hiswork could be called ``influence peddling'' but said he broke nolaws or HUD regulations.   Former Interior Secretary James Watt matter-of-factly defendedhis making $300,000 to $420,000 on one project alone _ for making afew phone calls to HUD and sitting down with Pierce for one meeting.   And Bill Taylor, a National Republican Committee member fromFlorida, bragged about his ability to win HUD work for his clientsand blurted out a sarcastic ``Good luck'' when told the goal of thehearings was to remove influence peddling from government.   He promised to stop cashing in on his political position ``assoon as Congress does.''</TEXT></DOC>
