Burroughs Wellcome Co., the manufacturer, says it's moving asfast as it can to make AZT available to kids. But the assurancerings hollow since the company has yet to apply for governmentapproval to market the drug to children under 12.   Critics say the company is dragging its feet because thepotential market among children is small.   Until the drug receives FDA approval for the children, theinsurance companies and the federal government will not pick up itscost ... about $6,000 a year _ which many parents cannot afford.   In addition, the adult formulation of AZT is too strong forchildren. The capsules must be broken and smaller amounts of thefoul-tasting medicine mixed with juice or another liquid.   The situation is absurd. The company should file an applicationas soon as possible and develop a dosage that is appropriate forchildern. AIDS doesn't discriminate against children.

Citizen Patriot on plans to redesign coins:   Tinkering with the U.S. monetary system is an itch that Congresscan't seem to scratch enough. So, would someone do our fearlessleaders a favor and send a gallon or two of anti-itch oil?   In recent months, a majority of senators and representatives inCongress have supported legislation to change the basic designs ofall of our coins. As one advocate put it, Congress believes thatAmericans want new coins that aren't so ``fixed in the past.''   Congress would have us remove the ``old baldie,'' the Americaneagle. It would be farewell to TJ's fabulous digs at Monticello andAbe Lincoln's multi-columned memorial.   Replacing them would be more contemporary designs on themes ofthe U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. The heads of JFK, FDR andother presidents would still adorn the ``heads'' sides of coins,but the likenesses would be updated.   We've got no objection to modernizing things that need to bemodernized. But where's the hue and cry arising for modernizedcoins? From coin collectors who don't have enough diversity?   It's hard to understand why Congress, so laden down with realmoney problems, must go out of its way to correct perceived moneyproblems. As harmless as it seems, redesigning coins does strangethings to the Americans psyche.   If you don't buy that, then 300 million stockpiled Susan B.Anthony silver dollars argue otherwise.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 29   The News-Leader, Springfield, Mo., on Braniff's Chapter 11:   Braniff Airlines is too much like the Phoenix that crashed inflames, only to rise again from the ashes. Only this bird has triedthe same trick twice at the expense of consumers and employees.   After leaving hundreds of customers stranded, after movinghundreds of employees to Kansas City (Mo.), after laying off 2,700employees, the airline says it expects to fly again despite itsfiling for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11.   Braniff fell victim to its own stupidity.   The final proof came (Sept. 27) when airline officials simplycanceled all but four flights without explanation pending aconfirmation announcement that came (the next day).   It is difficult to imagine, after such a repeat performance, whyanyone would trust Braniff for a future flight.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
