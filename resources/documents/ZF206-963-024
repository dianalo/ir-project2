(reduced instruction-setcomputer) (company profile)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Pelton, Charles.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>MIPS Computer Systems Inc seeks to make its RISC architecture a defacto standard through alliances and technology exchangeagreements with semiconductor companies, as well as systemsmanufacturers such as DEC and Tandem.andP;  The company's primarycompetitors are Sun Microsystems Inc and Motorola Corp. Sun'sSparc architecture has been licensed by several majormanufacturers and Motorola recently announced the 88000 RISCmicroprocessor.andP;  Sun's strategy is to sign up as many licensees aspossible, while Motorola's is to offer the 88000 as a 'completesystem in silicon.' MIPS was started in 1984 as a semiconductormanufacturer, but in 1987 the company switched its focus tosystems.andP;  MIPS machines use chips licensed to and manufactured bythree relatively small semiconductor manufacturers..andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   MIPS Computer Systems Inc.
