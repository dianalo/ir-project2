The agreement with Portugal, which was signedon March 30, 1988, is similar to U.S. social security agreements alreadyin force with ten other countries_Belgium, Canada, the Federal Republicof Germany, France, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and theUnited Kingdom. Agreements of this type are authorized by section 233 ofthe Social Security Act.Like the other agreements, the U.S.-Portuguese agreement eliminates dualsocial security coverage_the situation that exists when a worker from onecountry works in the other country and is covered under the social securitysystems of both countries for the same work. When dual coverage occurs,the worker or the worker's employer or both may be required to pay socialsecurity contributions to the two countries simultaneously. Under the U.S.-Portugueseagreement, a worker who is sent by an employer in the U.S. to work in Portugalfor 5 years or less remains covered only by the U.S. system. The agreementincludes additional rules that eliminate dual U.S. and Portuguese coveragein other work situations.The agreement also helps eliminate situations where workers suffer a lossof benefit rights because they have divided their careers between the twocountries. Under the agreement, workers may qualify for partial U.S. orpartial Portuguese benefits based on combined (totalized) work creditsfrom both countries.Persons who wish to obtain copies of the agreement or want more informationabout its provisions may write to the Social Security Administration, Officeof International Policy, Room 1104, West High Rise Building, 6401 SecurityBoulevard, Baltimore, MD 21235.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 25, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Dorcas R.
