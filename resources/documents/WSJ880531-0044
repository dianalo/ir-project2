The Hartford, Conn., company said the applications would increase electric rates by about $112 million and gas rates by $6.4 million. The increases are proposed to take effect in January 1989.    Northeast Utilities Chairman William B. Ellis attributed the proposed electric-rate increase primarily to the need to improve &quot;sagging&quot; earnings at the unit.    &quot;Connecticut Light andamp; Power's earnings have fallen significantly in the past year and must improve if the company is to continue as a high-quality electric and gas energy supplier,&quot; Mr. Ellis said. </TEXT></DOC>
