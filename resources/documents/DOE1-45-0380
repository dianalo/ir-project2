<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-45-0380 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Du Pont Savannah River Plant (SRP) Waste Management Program is committedto the safe handling, storage, and disposal of wastes that result fromthe production of special nuclear materials for the U.S. Department ofEnergy (U.S. DOE). High-level radioactive liquid waste is stored in undergroundcarbon steel tanks with double containment, and the volume is reducedby evaporation. An effluent treatment facility is being constructed totreat low-level liquid hazardous and radioactive waste. Solid low-levelwaste operations have been improved through the use of engineered low-leveltrenches, and transuranic waste handling procedures were modified in1974 to meet new DOE criteria requiring 20-year retrievable storage.An improved disposal technique, Greater Confinement Disposal, is beingdemonstrated for intermediate-level waste. Nonradioactive hazardous wasteis stored on site in RCRA interim status storage buildings. Technologicaladvancements will continue to be a major part of the waste managementeffort at SRP, along with compliance with progressive federal, state,and local environmental legislation.</TEXT></DOC>
