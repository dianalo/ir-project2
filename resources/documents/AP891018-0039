John C. Danforth, R-Mo., told the Senate on Tuesdayas he withdrew as one of 53 cosponsors of the proposedconstitutional amendment.   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., another cosponsor, also took to theSenate floor to abandon his support.   And Democratic critics said for the first time the measure waslikely to be defeated in a floor vote set for Thursday morning.   ``I hope and expect that there will not be sufficient votes forthe amendment to prevail,'' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,D-Maine, told reporters.   The measure would authorize the federal and state governments toban burning the American flag.   The House approved and sent to President Bush on Thursday a billthat would ban burning and other desecration of the American flagby simple statute. He said he would allow it to become law withouthis signature while continuing to press for a constitutionalamendment.   Supporters of a constitutional amendment say any statute islikely to be overturned in court on grounds that it violates freespeech guaranteed under the Bill of Rights.   The campaign for a constitutional amendment began in June afterthe Supreme Court threw out the conviction of Texas flag-burnerGregory Lee Johnson on grounds that his right to free speech hadbeen violated.   Critics of the amendment say a ``content neutral'' law thatoutlaws flag-burning regardless of whether it involves politicalprotest is better than tampering with constitutional freedoms.   If the measure is approved by the Senate it goes to the Houseand then to state legislatures. A proposed constitutional amendmentmust be approved by 38 legislatures before becoming part of theConstitution.   Danforth said that if the Senate did approve the measure it mostlikely would eventually be ratified, adding, ``If it is going to bestopped it must be stopped in the Senate.''   ``This is not a throwaway vote,'' Danforth said. ``This is notjust the kind of vote you cast thinking, well, this is nothing,somebody else can act as the safety net.''   ``We are the decision-makers,'' he said. ``We will beresponsible if the Constitution will be amended, and if it isamended it will be the first time in the history of our countrythat we have altered the Bill of Rights.''   A backer of the amendment, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, scoffed atthe notion that the Senate would be unduly tampering with freedomof speech if it passed the measure.   ``This freedom has never been deemed absolute,'' Hatch said.``Obscenity has never been protected under the First Amendment.''He said other restrictions also exist, such as libel laws.   Hatch said the measure ``does not prevent a single idea orthought from being expressed ... it merely prevents conduct withrespect to one object and one object only and that's our flag. Wecan withdraw that object from desecration without limiting freedomof speech.''   ``I believe it is futile to try to overturn this particularSupreme Court interpretation of the Constitution by a statute,''Hatch said.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said, however, that the measurewould put new powers in the hands of government and ``it containsno limits, no checks on the exercise of that power.''</TEXT></DOC>
