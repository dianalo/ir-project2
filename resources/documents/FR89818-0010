Background on the Pennsylvania Program </ITAG>The Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Pennsylvania programon July 31, 1982. Information on the general background of the Pennsylvaniaprogram submission, including the Secretary's findings, the dispositionof comments, and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval canbe found in the July 30, 1982, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (47 FR 33050). Subsequent actions concerningthe conditions of approval and program amendments are identified at 30CFR 938.11, 938.12, 938.15 and 938.16. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Submission of Amendment </ITAG>By letter dated August 17, 1988 (Administrative Record No. PA 699), Pennsylvaniaproposed to amend its Program Guidance Manual at Section 1:3:6, paragraph4 by replacing the mandatory civil penalty provision for each ComplianceOrder violation with a discretionary civil penalty provision. Under theexisting Pennsylvania program, all assessments for violations cited onCompliance Orders are mandatory, regardless of their nature. Following receipt of the proposed amendment by OSMRE, the DER discoveredthat the State's Civil Penalty Program document at Section II, paragraph4 had to be revised to reflect the proposed change in the Program GuidanceManual. A proposal to amend the Civil Penalty Program document was submittedto OSMRE by letter dated June 21, 1989 (Administrative Record Number PA780). The substantive content of the proposed revision to the Civil PenaltyProgram document is identical to the proposed change in the Program GuidanceManual with the added limitation that the violation not be related to adischarge. OSMRE is therefore treating the August 17, 1988, and June 21,1989, submissions as one amendment since they concern the same substantiveissue. OSMRE announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the October 6, 1988,<T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 39316), and in the same notice, openedthe public comment period and provided opportunity for a public hearingon the adequacy of the proposed amendment. Comments were not solicitedon the June 21, 1989, submission because the change submitted by the Statewas considered to be within the scope of the original proposal. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Director's Findings </ITAG>The mandatory civil penalty provision for a Compliance Order violationwas approved as part of Pennsylvania's Civil Penalty Program on March 20,1984 (49 FR 10253), along with other civil penalty provisions. At thattime, the Secretary of the Interior found that the program and its accompanyingpolicy statements and guidance manuals provided for civil and criminalpenalties no less stringent than those of Section 518 of SMCRA. The Secretaryalso found that the program's procedures for assessing and reviewing civilpenalty assessments were the same as or similar to those in Section 518of SMCRA and no less effective than those provided by 30 CFR part 845.The proposed amendment will provide DER with the option to waive the civilpenalty for any Compliance Order violation when the calculated assessedamount of the penalty is less than $1,000 and the violation does not relateto a discharge. This amendment will not affect Section 2, paragraph 3 ofthe Civil Penalty Program document which requires mandatory civil penaltieswhen the assessment amount for a Compliance Order violation is $1,000 orgreater. The Federal counterpart at 30 CFR 845.12 requires a mandatory civil penaltyfor each violation assigned 31 or more points which, under the Federalassessment scheme, equates to $1,100. Thus, the proposed amendment providesfor a mandatory civil penalty at a lower dollar level than do the Federalrules. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, in <T3>In re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation </T3>(Civil Action79-1144, February 26, 1980), ruled that SMCRA requires states to developpenalty systems incorporating the penalty criteria listed in section 518(a)of the Act and that these systems must result in the imposition of penaltiesno less stringent than those set forth in the Act; however, penalties neednot be assessed in all cases where they would be under 30 CFR part 845,nor need penalty amounts be equivalent to those of 30 CFR part 845. Under section 518(a) of SMCRA, the assessment of civil penalties by theregulatory authority is discretionary, except when a violation leads tothe issuance of a cessation order. In determining the amount of penalty,a regulatory authority is required by section 518(a) to give considerationto: (1) The permittee's history of previous violations, (2) the seriousnessof the violation, (3) whether the permittee was negligent; and (4) thedemonstrated good faith of the permittee charged in attempting to achieverapid compliance after notification. These criteria are present in Pennsylvania'ssystem of assessment of civil penalties. Furthermore, the State's rulesat 25 PA Code 86.193(a) provide for mandatory civil penalties for eachviolation which is included as a basis for a cessation order. For the reasons discussed above, the Director finds that the amendmentprovides for the assessment of civil penalties no less stringent than thosein section 518 of SMCRA and that the procedural requirements relating tocivil penalty assessments are consistent with 30 CFR part 845. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Disposition of Comments </ITAG>Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), commentswere solicited from various Federal agencies with an actual or potentialinterest in the Pennsylvania program. Only one, the United States EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA), provided substantive comments. It suggested thatPennsylania and OSMRE consider the feasibility of dismissing civil penaltiesonly when the accumulative total of civil penalties for the respectivefacility does not exceed $1,000 annually (Administrative Record No. PA716). Otherwise, all civil penalties would become due and payable. OSMRE does not accept this comment because the State's system for assessmentof civil penalties already gives consideration to a violator's historyof previous violations. Section 86.194(b)(6) of the Pennsylvania Code requiresthat a penalty assessment be increased by a factor of 5.0 percent for eachprevious violation within the previous two-year period. Each previous violationmust be counted without regard to whether it led to a civil penalty assessment.OSMRE believes that Pennsylvania's system for assessment of civil penaltieswhich includes consideration of the permittee's history of previous violationsachieves the financial deterrent recommended by the commenter. The Director also solicited public comments in the October 6, 1988 <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 39316). No comments were received andno one requested a public hearing to present testimony. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Director's Decision </ITAG>For the reasons discussed in the finding above, the Director is approvingthe amendment as submitted to OSMRE on August 17, 1988, and June 21, 1989.The Federal rules at 30 CFR part 938 codifying decisions concerning thePennsylvania program are being amended to implement this decision. Thisfinal rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State programamendment process. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Procedural Determinations </ITAG>National Environmental Policy Act The Secretary has determined that, pursuant to section 702(d) of SMCRA,30 U.S.C. 1292(d), no environmental impact statement need be prepared onthis rulemaking. Executive Order No. 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act On July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSMREan exemption from section 3, 4, 7 and 8 of Executive Order 12291 for actionsdirectly related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatoryprograms. Therefore, for this action, OSMRE is exempt from the requirementto prepare a regulatory impact analysis, and this action does not requireregulatory review by OMB. The Department of Interior has determined that this rule will not havea signficant economic effect on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This rule will not impose any new requirements; rather,it will ensure that existing requirements established by SMCRA and theFederal rules will be met by the State. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Managment and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 938 </ITAG>Coal mining, Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Alfred E.
