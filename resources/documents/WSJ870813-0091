Warwick, according to current and former SEC staff members and outside securities lawyers.    The rift, the staff members said, has been aggravated by the tabling of a major insider-trading investigation. That, in turn, has led to demoralization among some key SEC attorneys and investigators handling insider-trading cases.    The most visible casualty of the rift is Anne Flannery, the New York office's enforcement chief, who resigned last week. Ms. Flannery, who couldn't be reached for comment, left to go into private practice after a series of disagreements with Ms. Warwick, the SEC staff members said. Ms. Warwick, a former corporate securities counsel, was named to head the SEC's New York office late last year.    The turmoil has led to delays in other insider-trading investigations handled by the New York office, staff members said. These staffers blame an inability to communicate with Ms. Warwick and a perception that the administrator isn't interested in pursuing further insider cases. As a result, several senior officials in the office are understood to be seeking jobs elsewhere.    While the SEC's Washington headquarters and the U.S. attorney's office in New York have handled most of the government's sweeping insider-trading investigation, the New York office has handled several major cases and has provided investigators a look into the activities of Wall Street figures such as Dennis Levine and Ivan Boesky. The office has about 200 staff members, including about 40 lawyers in the enforcement division.    &quot;The enforcement division has been rendered so ineffective it can't do its duties,&quot; says one staff member. &quot;Those of us who have been around awhile, who have worked hard to recruit good people, are just going to leave.&quot;    Ms. Warwick, reached yesterday at an American Bar Association meeting in San Francisco, denied the existence of any dissension and expressed surprise at criticism directed at her by SEC staff members. &quot;You've been hearing reports of dissension in the New York office? Absolutely not, not to my knowledge at all,&quot; she said. &quot;It's not true. I've been enjoying (the job) immensely, and have been having great fun.&quot;    Still, rumors of turmoil within the office have circulated in New York's legal community for some time. Many lawyers assumed the friction developed because Ms. Warwick was chosen as regional administrator last year over Ms. Flannery and other candidates inside the agency. Ms. Warwick was a securities counsel for Mobil Corp. for 11 years before entering private practice briefly last year.    &quot;It's a pretty classic problem in government,&quot; says a former SEC official who resigned from the New York office for personal reasons earlier this year. &quot;A situation like this often happens when someone from the outside is brought in. When you get a new boss there's going to be a power struggle. It's really gotten in the way of business.&quot;    However, others who know Ms. Warwick believe she is intent on reining in an enforcement division that enjoyed considerable autonomy under her predecessor, Ira L. Sorkin. &quot;I know Kathy doesn't let them bring things just because they want to,&quot; said Marvin Schwartz, a top securities lawyer with the New York firm of Sullivan andamp; Cromwell. &quot;She looks at their cases with a tough eye.&quot;    Indeed, agency staff members say Ms. Warwick's unusual tabling of an &quot;action memo&quot; recommending prosecution in a major insider-trading investigation has sparked some of the current dissension. Staff members wouldn't identify the case, but one said it has been languishing on Ms. Warwick's desk &quot;for more than several months.&quot;    &quot;Warwick sat on it for several weeks, picked at it -- and it has still hasn't gone on to Washington,&quot; said one agency official, who characterized Ms. Warwick's action as unprecedented. &quot;What's the point of breaking one's neck?&quot; if a major investigation will be tabled, the official asked.    Ms. Warwick, who is 52 years old and began her legal career as an SEC staff attorney in 1965, says she has never delayed any enforcement action. &quot;I have never held up any work,&quot; she said.    The case in question appears to be an outgrowth of the so-called &quot;Yuppie Five&quot; case, in which the SEC's New York office broke up an insider-trading ring that included young lawyers and investment bankers. The continuing investigation is understood to focus on the actions of several prominent investment bankers and arbitragers.    Ms. Warwick denied that she is trying to rein in the enforcement division. However, she took several actions that apparently diminished Ms. Flannery's scope at the SEC. Two staff members say that two-thirds of a large group of additional personnel promised to the enforcement division were diverted instead to other divisions. Ms. Warwick says the enforcement division got most of the new personnel. Ms. Warwick also replaced Ms. Flannery's name on SEC enforcement filings with her own.    Ms. Warwick's management style differs from that of her predecessor, Mr. Sorkin. Where Mr. Sorkin's corridor door was left open, Ms. Warwick's is usually closed -- to prevent passers-by from a nearby Immigration and Naturalization Service office from wandering in, she says. Mr. Sorkin was sociable, knew many staff members' first names and frequently dropped in on hearings and meetings. Ms. Warwick, staff members say, shows little interest in meeting with the staff and spends time pursuing other business, including her interests in the American Bar Association. Ms. Warwick denies that.    &quot;Ike was down with the troops, he knew us,&quot; notes a recently departed SEC staff member. &quot;There is no sense of where the New York office is going. I can definitely confirm the demoralization.&quot;    The departure of Ms. Flannery was a big blow to the New York office's morale. The 35-year-old lawyer, who will be joining the New York office of Philadelphia-based Morgan, Lewis andamp; Bockius, last year received a top award from the Federal Bar Association and had previously received one of the SEC's top three awards. &quot;Anne Flannery was the best lawyer on the entire commission staff,&quot; says Mr. Sorkin, her former boss. </TEXT></DOC>
