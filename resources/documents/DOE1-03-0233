<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-03-0233 </DOCNO><TEXT>The stable isotope separation program, established in 1945, has operatedcontinually to provide enriched stable isotopes and selected radioactiveisotopes, including the actinides, for use in research, medicine, andindustrial applications. This report summarizes the first forty yearsof effort in the production and distribution of stable isotopes. Evolutionof the program along with the research and development, chemical processing,and production efforts are highlighted. A total of 3.86 million separatorhours has been utilized to separate 235 isotopes of 56 elements. Relativeeffort expended toward processing each of these elements is shown. Collectionrates (mg/separator h), which vary by a factor of 20,000 from the highestto the lowest ({sup 205}Tl to {sup 46}Ca), and the attainable isotopicpurity for each isotope are presented. Policies related to isotope pricing,isotope distribution, and support for the enrichment program are discussed.Changes in government funding, coupled with large variations in salesrevenue, have resulted in 7-fold perturbations in production levels.</TEXT></DOC>
