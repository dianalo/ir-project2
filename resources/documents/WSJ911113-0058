The British concession, which came during a key, two-daymeeting here of foreign ministers, greatly increases thechances that there will be a last-minute compromise onpolitical union at the EC's summit Dec. 9-10 in Maastricht,Belgium. At that summit, EC leaders hope to sign twotreaties, streamlining the EC's decision-making proceduresand expanding the EC's powers to foreign affairs, defense andmonetary matters. Britain was the only country that had beenholding back on new powers to the European Parliament.</LP><TEXT>   The British concession was the strongest indication yetthat Britain is softening its hard-line stance againstpolitical union. It comes a day after Prime Minister JohnMajor said he wanted to keep Britain &quot;on the road toever-closer union among the peoples of Europe&quot; and called for&quot;give and take on all sides&quot; to reach an agreement inMaastricht.   Many other disputes have to be settled before thepolitical union treaty can be completed. Moreover, there isstill no agreement on how many areas of Community law the newparliamentary procedure would cover. &quot;The discussion is notyet completed and we will not agree {on the Parliament'spowers} until we know what areas are included,&quot; a Britishofficial cautioned.   The Netherlands, which holds the EC presidency, hassuggested that the new procedure for the parliament be usedin five legislative areas: internal market (laws pertainingto the movement of goods, capital services and people),consumer protection, some areas of environmental legislation,some research and development measures and laws dealing withPan-European infrastructure such as roads andtelecommunications. The regular EC decision-making system,which gives national governments the final say, would beemployed in all other areas, such as social affairs,education, economic affairs, tourism, public health andculture.   But the British official said the list of areas forincreased powers for the Parliament would have to be&quot;considerably more limited.&quot; So far, Britain would considerusing the new procedure only for internal market legislation,he said, though further concessions would be considered.   Nevertheless, the British move on this key element will atleast improve the atmosphere in what has been a difficult andtroubled negotiation. Germany, the Benelux countries(Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg), Spain and Italyhave all been pushing for greater powers for the EuropeanParliament, saying that this is for them the key to apolitical union agreement. Germany, moreover, had said thatit wouldn't approve the monetary union treaty, which is closeto agreement, if there wasn't a parallel agreement that putthe Community under the control of democratic institutionswith proper checks and balances.   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had hinted earlierthat Britain might be prepared to concede some newresponsibilities to the Parliament, but this is the firsttime that he has agreed to give in on lawmaking powers. Untilnow, Britain had suggested, for example, that the Parliamentbe allowed to scrutinize the EC Commission's budget.</TEXT></DOC>
