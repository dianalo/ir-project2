This paper deals mainly with theevaluation and the reduction of the area overhead brought by SEF. A newshift register filtering latch configuration is proposed. The use ofthis latch, optimized for minimum area, reduces the area overhead bya factor of 2.6, when compared with latches optimized for time performance.A detailed analysis of the area overhead with SEF implemented on tworelatively complex machines produced the following results: a SEF versionof the 6800 microprocessor would require an area overhead varying between12% and 69% depending on the SEF latch used and, a SEF version of theRISCII microprocessor would result in a 38.8% area overhead. An analysisof the cost of implementing the Hamming error correcting code on a registerarray is presented and this cost is compared with that of implementingSEU tolerance directly with SEF. Finally, a hybrid approach is proposedwhere a large register array is protected by an error correcting codewhereas the isolated latches are replaced by filtering latches. Thishybrid approach reduces the area overhead to 18.8% for the RISCII architecture.</TEXT></DOC>
