At this early stage in the research, we areconcerned with a full-scale cold flow prototype and are focusing ourwork on the determination of the pressure drop and the particle classificationcapabilities, likely to be encountered. If the pressure drop across theimpactor were to be too large, the concept on an in-situ impactor wouldhave to be discarded. The theory, rationale and final design of the coldflow impactor are described. 4 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
