This week's military coup by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who led thenation's three-man ruling junta for two years until January, wasthe latest in a series of bitter disappointments fordemocratic-minded Haitians.   It ended the nation's experiment with more than four months ofnominal civilian rule and restored the army's almost uninterruptedpolitical monopoly since independence in 1804.   Namphy proclaimed a military government whose Cabinet includesjust one civilian and declared himself president on Monday, only afew hours after easily deposing President Leslie Manigat.   The army's latest occupation of the national palace showsHaiti's 6 million mostly illiterate and poverty-stricken peoplethat little has apparently changed since they ran joyously throughthe streets in February 1986, celebrating the departure ofJean-Claude Duvalier and the end of the 29-year dictatorshipfounded by his father, Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier.   Twice in the past seven months, Haitians have had reason to hopedemocracy might finally be realized _ the days before thwartedelections in November, and last week when Manigat briefly assertedcivilian control over the military.   Both times, Haitians were abruptly and violently deprived ofthat hope.   Manigat, a 57-year-old political scientist, was elected Jan. 17,in fraud-riddled elections. The ballotting was nevertheless thefirst that even hinted at democracy in almost 30 years.   Though critics said Manigat was put in power by the military, hepromised to reorganize the 7,000-man army and make it work towarddeveloping the country.   Even some of his critics cheered his attempt last week to assertcivilian control over the military, saying it confirmed hisassertions he was not a military puppet.   He began Wednesday by overruling a decision made by Namphy, themilitary commander. On Friday, he fired Namphy and put him underhouse arrest.   Manigat's audacity provoked a swift reaction. On Sunday, when hesought to transfer many of Namphy's allies to lesser posts, thearmy rebelled and returned Namphy to power.   Two years earlier, Namphy also raised the hopes of many Haitiansby promising to restore democracy and cede power to afreely-elected government.   He released political prisoners and pledged to try to recovermillions of dollars from the Duvaliers, who left the country'seconomy and agriculture in ruins.   But his 24 months at Haiti's helm were marred by constitutionalviolations and arbitrary arrests, as well as assassinations ofpolitical leaders, peasants and demonstrators.   Meanwhile, there was little change in the living conditions ofthe hungry and homeless masses.   In June 1987, Namphy's government tried to take control ofnational elections and in July his troops killed more than 100demonstrators who were demanding he step down.   On Nov. 29, months of enthusiasm and joy at the prospect of thecountry's first genuinely free elections were shattered in an orgyof blood and death.   While Namphy's soldiers stood by or helped, armed thugs shot andhacked to death more than 30 voters.   The massacre terrorized Haitians and provoked outrage abroad.When asked to go to the polls again Jan. 17 in army-supervisedvoting, the most popular candidates refused to run and few Haitiansbothered to go to the polls.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   EDITOR`S NOTE: Pierre-Yves Glass, recently assigned as an editoron the AP's Caribbean Desk in San Juan, was AP correspondent inHaiti for 16 months and covered the Nov. 29 and Jan. 17 elections.</TEXT></DOC>
