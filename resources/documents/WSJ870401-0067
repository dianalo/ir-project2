Donald Bell resigned after serving as president for slightly more than a year.    He was succeeded by Wallace W. Booth, the 64-year-old chairman and chief executive officer, who again assumes the president's post that he relinquished in 1985.    The electronic-products maker said Mr. Bell also resigned as a director and as president of Kierulff, the company's largest division. Ducommun didn't give a reason for Mr. Bell's departure, although it said he would remain as a consultant &quot;to ensure an orderly transition.&quot;    Mr. Bell, in an interview, said he and Mr. Booth &quot;have had some fundamental disagreements in philosophy and management style. They were of a magnitude that I think we mutually arrived at the decision to leave.&quot; Mr. Bell, 49, said he didn't have any immediate plans other than to &quot;help (Ducommun) through the transition.&quot;    The executive's departure is the second time in recent years that a president at Ducommun lasted in the job for only about a year. Mr. Bell took over his job in February 1986, succeeding David G. Schmidt, who had been president for 11 months. At the time of his resignation, Mr. Schmidt said he was leaving because &quot;I wasn't getting along with the chairman.&quot;    Mr. Bell joined Ducommun as executive vice president of Kierulff in 1980 and was named president of the division the following year.    Ducommun named William J. Smith, vice president, corporate marketing, for Kierulff, to be president of the division. </TEXT></DOC>
