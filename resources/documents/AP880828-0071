(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Long after explorers charted their course bystars or compass, a computer software pioneer has literally mappedout a product and a business strategy that is guiding his companyto success.   The 3-year-old company is MapInfo Corp., which sells a softwarepackage that allows the personal computer user to merge databasesand digital maps of areas within the United States.   With a couple of keystrokes, the user can place the cursor at apoint on a map displayed on the computer screen and have access tovolumes of information about that point.   MapInfo can search a database for points within a boundary,determine latitude and longitude of a point or find an address.Users can focus in on a 52-foot span of a city block or zoom out toa 5,000-mile range.   That may not sound like anything new, says MapInfo PresidentSean O'Sullivan with a smile, but his young company claims to beNo.1 in desktop mapping. In fact, he says, there isn't even anycompetition _ yet.   ``These kinds of capabilities have been available onminicomputers and mainframes before, but it's never been made sothat the common person can use it or it's never been priced so thatthe common person can afford it,'' said O'Sullivan, who developedthe company with three other students of Rensselaer PolytechnicInstitute in 1985.   While some might view MapInfo's product as competition formapping via larger computers, it can also complement those methods,says Thomas Delaney, manager in IBM's geographic and mappingproducts department in Kingston, N.Y.   IBM is on MapInfo's list of customers, and is also a competitor.   ``The market is not really a market where if you do PC stuff,you're going to influence mainframes. It really all has to worktogether,'' he said.   Delaney refused to say if IBM, which now is involved in mappingusing mainframes and minicomputers, is developing a program thatwould be comparable to MapInfo's.   So just who uses digital maps and databases on personalcomputers?   Companies or individuals use MapInfo for sales and marketing,trend analysis, demographic analysis, dispatching and even planningof routes for optical fiber cables.   Customers include police departments who want to map out crimescenes, real estate agents, city planners, cemetery planners,orange growers and scientists tracking insect populations or AIDSconcentrations.   ``Even if the job is really large ... and they've (clients) gottheir heart set on a larger system, we would recommend MapInfo tostart out with and to train their people, if nothing else,'' saidMickey Talton, vice president of CAPS Consulting, which works withthe growing market of geographical information systems.   Based in Tuscaloosa, Ala., CAPS Consulting deals primarily withurban planning departments and recommends MapInfo frequentlybecause of its quality, speed with large databases, ease of use andprice, he said.   ``Smaller cities and smaller government entities can afford tohave this in their offices,'' he said.   O'Sullivan said sales went from zero to millions within oneyear, but he refuses to disclose figures.   Their customers, which are located in 18 countries, include theU.S. Postal Service, United Parcel Service, the U.S. GeologicalSurvey, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., Chrysler Corp., GeneralMotors Corp., Chemical Bank and McDonald's Corp.   This spring, MapInfo won a $250,000 contract with the U.S. Armyto provide mapping software to its recruiting command.   The system will be used for sales and marketing applications tohelp the Army better allocate recruiting personnel.   ``There's a potential (for MapInfo) to be a $50 (million) to a$100 million dollar company down the road,'' O'Sullivan said.   MapInfo came to be when O'Sullivan completed the design of anelectronic map and tracking system for automobiles as part of acollege project. By the time Sullivan graduated in 1985, he andthree other engineers and programmers had joined with businessconsultant Michael Marvin and obtained financial backing to launchthe firm.   The first digital mapping system was unveiled in 1987, thecurrent version in January 1988.   The software package costs $750 and digital maps for 300metropolitan areas in the United States range in price up to $2,000.   The programs provide names of streets, rivers and bridges, aswell as address number ranges for every block and side of a street.   Buyers can also use the software with their own maps.   Because the firm has met with success so far and has beenwritten about in technical magazines, the threat of competitionalways looms.   ``We always feel like we're running against ghosts,'' saidMarvin, who is MapInfo's chief executive officer.   An offshoot of the firm called Map Media International waslaunched this spring, which uses the MapInfo software and adapts itto the markets for newspaper and television.   And at MapInfo, the development staff is always working on thenext version of the mapping system.   ``This company actually has the chance to be one of the top 10software companies in the United States, because the market is justexploding at this point in time,'' O'Sullivan contended.</TEXT></DOC>
