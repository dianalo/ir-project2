CMS Energy said the transaction involves two separate agreements. Under the first, it will acquire about 2.2 million newly issued shares of Oxford at $6 a share. Under the second, it will buy about 2.7 million shares of Oxford from a third party.    A CMS Energy spokesman wouldn't disclose the price the company will pay for the third-party shares, but he said the value of the entire transaction, including the shares purchased from Oxford, is less than $30 million.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, CMS Energy closed at $17.875, up 12.5 cents. Oxford closed at $5.25, up 12.5 cents, in American Stock Exchange composite trading.    CMS Energy's chief subsidiary is Consumers Power Co., Michigan's largest gas and electric utility. The company also is building a large cogeneration plant with Dow Chemical Co. in Midland, Mich. Oxford owns several power facilities including one plant that burns old tires to make electricity and another electric plant that will be fueled by rice hulls, a CMS Energy spokesman said.    &quot;We think they're on the cutting edge of technology,&quot; he said. Future electricity needs are &quot;going to be produced in alternative ways,&quot; he added, which prompted CMS Energy's interest in Oxford. </TEXT></DOC>
