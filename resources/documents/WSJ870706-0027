The 31-month contract, which runs until July 31, 1989, provides for a 3% wage increase Aug. 1 this year and a further 3% increase Aug. 1 next year. It has to be ratified by the union membership. The union has been without a contract since Dec. 31.    Job security and work practices, such as washing up time and the location of lunch breaks, were main issues in the negotiations.    Canada Post, a government agency that operates the postal service, said the new agreement provides &quot;compromises and trade-offs&quot; that will help the corporation meet its goals. The union, which represents 20,000 letter carriers, said the agreement protects the job security of its members. It said it also makes few concessions on work practices.    Canada Post also is threatened by the prospect of another major postal union going on strike. The 23,000-member Canadian Union of Postal Workers, which represents letter sorters and other indoor postal workers, expects to be in a legal position to strike by mid-August. </TEXT></DOC>
