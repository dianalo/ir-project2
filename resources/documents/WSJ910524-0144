Things are lookingpretty good.&quot;   A big reason is that the state government has been able toresist the temptation to lure businesses with such come-onsas tax breaks, largely because of Colorado's naturalattributes: great scenery, great weather, generous naturalresources and great skiing. Perhaps as a result of thestate's economic and political stability, Colorado's totalper-capita taxes -- including sales, income and all otherlevies -- rank 45th in the nation, yet another attraction forcompanies considering moving.   Escaping a national downturn would be nothing new forColorado. In the past four national recessions -- 1981-82,1980, 1973-75 and 1970 -- Colorado's business activity, asmeasured by its gross state product, continued to expand.What's more, Colorado was the only state in the lower 48 toescape the four declines unscathed; Alaska also avoided thenational recessions.   All told, nine states avoided the 1981-82 downturn, 22sailed through the 1980 decline in good shape, 13 skipped the1973-75 recession, and 27 did all right in 1970. But onlyColorado and Alaska weathered all four recessions --conventionally defined as two consecutive declines in grossstate product, which is a state's total output of goods andservices.   The U.S., of course, is a large and diverse country. Somestates always do better than others because they supply goodsand services that happen, at a particular time, to be instrong demand. Some states have their own little businesscycles, perhaps because they are so far away from nationalmarkets that they are unaffected by ups and downs in thosemarkets.   Ken Ackbareli, an economist at First Interstate Bancorp.in Los Angeles, figures that Alaska owes only about 10% ofits growth to national factors. &quot;For Colorado,&quot; he says, &quot;thefigure is about 50%, so both states are partly exempt fromnational declines.&quot;   Colorado had a &quot;little business cycle&quot; in the first halfof the 1980s. Rising oil prices had spurred a drilling boomin the Rocky Mountain area, and a number of oil companies andsupply firms had built headquarters in Denver. But toward themiddle of the decade, oil prices fell, and Colorado'soffice-building boom soured.   Many Coloradans figure they had a recession, but grossstate product and personal income kept growing, though atslower rates. &quot;All I know is that things certainly changedaround here,&quot; says Chris Blackwood, an economist with KichnerMoore andamp; Co., an investment firm in Denver. &quot;Before ithappened I would look out my window and see nothing butconstruction cranes. You don't see those now.&quot;   Nonresidential construction still is weak in Colorado,though office vacancies have been falling. Residentialconstruction is doing well, reflecting the continued influxof new businesses and residents. The economists interviewedby Western Blue Chip Economic Forecast, a newsletter based atArizona State University, now expect housing permits to riseclose to 20% this year and another 20% in 1992.   So, unlike much of the country, Colorado isn't worriedabout housing. &quot;Our construction recession is behind us,&quot;says Ms. Drury of Regis College. &quot;Our troubles in themid-1980s led companies to cut costs and otherwise slim down.Whatever happens to the national economy, we've beenpreparing for it for five years. We're really lean and mean.&quot;   Consumers are reasonably optimistic, too, which bodes wellfor spending. The Conference Board, a private researchorganization, reports that in April the index of expectationsfor the Rocky Mountain area, which includes Colorado, stoodat 119.9, the highest figure for any area in the nation. Notsurprisingly, New England, still mired in a constructionrecession, had an expectations index of 83.7, the lowest forany area.   Carolyn Sherwood-Call, an economist at the San FranciscoFederal Reserve Bank, recently studied the stability of stateand regional economies between l963 and 1986. She found themost stable economies were those of Kansas, the District ofColumbia, California -- and Colorado.   As Ms. Sherwood-Call points out, a region's stability candepend in part on its resource endowments -- and the demandfor them. Such advantages can change.   Colorado, for instance, benefited mightily from thediscovery of gold in the state in 1859. A great influx ofpeople took place to the cry of &quot;Pike's Peak or bust.&quot; Goldfirst was panned from streams, but later miners sought themother lode in the mountains.   By 1890 the gold was largely gone, but its effectslingered. The gold miners' hunger had spurred the developmentof agricultural irrigation on the state's plains, andagriculture remains an important source of state income. Thisled to cultivation of sugar beets and the development of amajor beet sugar industry. Many analysts have calledirrigation the most significant event in Colorado's history.The old mining towns and the old-fashioned trains that linkedthem, moreover, have become major tourist attractions.   Large deposits of iron, oil and coal helped to makeColorado Fuel andamp; Iron, now known as CFandamp;I Steel Corp., based inPueblo, a pioneer steel producer in 1892 specializing inrailroad rails. But distances from markets and the decliningimportance of railroads have contributed to the decline ofthe company. The firm is now in bankruptcy-law proceedings.   Colorado has vast oil shale deposits, but in 1982 it wasdecided to abandon a synthetic-fuel project that would haveused the deposits. So the shale remains right where it was.   During World War II, the need for metals, especiallymolybdenum, spurred a new Colorado industry. Molybdenum is asoft, lustrous metallic element used in alloys, parts forelectrical resistance furnaces, and points for spark plugs,among other things. Demand had declined, but last year thereopening of a large molybdenum mine owned by Amax Inc.signaled the end of that downturn.   At present, Colorado's four major industries are tourism,agriculture, advanced-technology manufacturing, and energy.High-tech manufacturing, which includes a good deal ofdefense, is especially important to Colorado, since its highunit prices make it economic to ship products long distancesto market. And so far, the proposed defense cutbacks have hadlittle effect on Colorado.   Why is there so much high-tech manufacturing in Colorado?&quot;I think the big thing is life style,&quot; says Jerry L. Jordan,chief economist of First Interstate. &quot;You can do that kind ofthing anywhere, but the skiing is better in Colorado. Thesummers are nice, too.&quot;   Colorado's life style has helped to attract an educatedwork force, and industries that have grown rapidly in recentyears have included printing, publishing, and food products.Skiing has grown rapidly, almost too rapidly for the state tohandle it. New facilities continue to be built -- andcontinue to overflow. State economists look for the increaseto continue as oil drilling activity picks up in nearbyOklahoma and Texas, two major sources of Colorado's skiers.   Denver is at work on a major new project that will aidout-of-state skiers -- as well as Colorado business: a newairport. Stapleton, the existing airport, has over the yearsbecome something of a national joke. Inclement weather, notunknown in the Rocky Mountains, can cut Stapleton down to oneor two runways, causing long delays. Since Denver is a majorhub serving several airlines, the weather problems can causesystemwide delays.   While Colorado hasn't been hit as hard as other states byeconomic declines, neither has it had the booms that otherareas have experienced. The only exceptions are the gold rushof a century ago and the brief oil boom of the late 1970s andearly 1980s. As Ms. Sherwood-Call of the San Francisco Fedsays, states can if they choose plan for rapid expansion andrisk the busts. Colorado, by and large, seems to have optedfor stability.</TEXT></DOC>
