In addition, it will make available monthlydata on the activity of these institutions in twelve-month blocks in Augustof each year.The Board will also make available in June aggregates of information reportedby thrift institutions on the amount and yield/cost of financial assetsand liabilities classified by remaining time to maturity or repricing.Beginning with the March 1990 data collection, the Board will release thedata (Section H of the Thrift Financial Report) for individual thrift institutions.The Board has been collecting this data since 1984 as a means of measuringthe interest rate risk exposure of thrift institutions. This information,together with certain assumptions regarding mortgage loan prepayment rates,is used to measure the sensitivity of thrift institution earnings and netasset values to changes in market interest rates. The Board recognizes,however, that such measurement may be imprecise because of the level ofaggregation and simplification required to make it feasible for institutionsof all types to report such information.Because the measurement of interest rate risk exposure is essential tothe assessment of a thrift institution's safety and soundness, the Boardhas developed a comprehensive interest rate risk program encompassing guidanceon prudent interest rate risk policies and procedures (Thrift Bulletin13) and the integration of interest rate risk exposure in the Board's risk-basedcapital proposal. The measurement of interest rate risk is a critical componentof this program.Because of the importance of interest rate risk measurement and the limitationson that measurement imposed by data aggregation, the Board is requestingcomment on methods to improve data collection for interest rate risk measurement.The enhancements to Section H effective June 1989 have extended the rangeof data available to the Board. Further enhancements may be warranted andthe Board is soliciting comment for all interested parties on recommendationsfor such enhancements.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John F.
