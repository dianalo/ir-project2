Thisstructure is composed of two concrete cylindrical shells, tridimensionalinternals, equipments (vessel steam generator) and loops. In additionsoil structure interaction must be taken into account. The present studydeals with the influence of the modelisation on the seismic responseof the whole structure. It is divided into three steps: 3D modelisationof the internals and calculation of an equivalent axisymmetric modelfor both horizontal and vertical seismic input; axisymmetric calculationof the reactor building: the equipment and loops being modelised as addedmass, the soil as springs and dampers; 3D calculation using a substructuredescription of the problem. The seismic responses obtained by the twocalculations are then compared.</TEXT></DOC>
