Lawton Chiles is expected to present a statebudget today that attacks a $1.7 billion revenue shortfallwith layoffs, deep spending cuts and some new twists onFlorida's hodgepodge of fees and consumption taxes.   The new Democratic governor's proposal, as outlined latelast week, includes a 20% increase in state-college tuitionfees and a new 3.5% assessment on hospitals that don'tprovide enough care for the poor. The budget calls for higherwages for some state workers -- but the money would come fromeliminating as many as 6,000 jobs. There would be an extra$91.5 million for prenatal care but less for thecriminal-justice system. School departments would have morefreedom over spending -- but many would have less money tospend.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There's no doubt about it, it's a pain budget,&quot; saidPasquale L. Tornillo Jr., president of the state teachersunion. He and others are hoping the largely Democraticlegislature, after passing a first budget during its regular60-day session, will return this fall to consider changes inthe state's tax system.   Florida, whose annual spending is approaching $30 billion,is one of six states that have no income tax. Prospects forpassing one are slim because it would take a constitutionalamendment and voters have been overwhelmingly opposed.   More than half the state's revenue come from a 6% salestax. The rest comes from a corporate income tax, federaldisbursements, and a panoply of levies passed over the yearsto plug the holes.   But &quot;sin taxes&quot; on alcohol, cigarettes and gasolinehaven't produced the expected revenue. Corporate profit taxeshave slumped. And the sales tax, which exempts food and othernecessities, has proved especially sensitive to therecession.   Meanwhile, Florida's population growth is slowing. So,where the state had doubledigit revenue growth in years pastfrom economic expansion, budget forecasters are now hopingfor 6% growth and getting their pencils ready to lower thatfigure if the war drags on.   The slower growth hasn't eased spending demands much,especially in the entitlement programs that are strainingmany states' budgets: education, welfare and Medicaid. EdwardMontanaro, director of the Florida legislature's division ofeconomic and demographic research, estimates that simplymaintaining services at current levels in those three areaswould cost an extra $550 million this year, eating up 82% ofthe expected revenue gains. And the strain will only increasein coming years, according to University of Florida economicsprofessor David A. Denslow, since school-aged children andnursing home-aged adults will increase as a percentage ofFlorida's population.   The legislature had to cut $800 million from the currentbudget because of a revenue shortfall, and Gov. Chilesalready faces some skepticism that his fees will raise asmuch as he hopes.   But there is little skepticism about the need for Floridato tighten its belt. In one symbolic gesture, the legislatureadopted new rules last month that make it harder for membersto sneak pork-barrel projects into the budget. The governor,for his part, reversed a pay raise for his top aides andproposed cutting his own pay 8%.   Many are resigned to more taxes in the future. In fact, abusiness lobbying group, Associated Industries of Florida,has already floated its own suggestion for a tax on legalfees and other business transactions.   &quot;We're not out there pushing for a new tax. We don't thinknow's the time,&quot; said Jon Shebel, the organization'spresident. &quot;But we want to be prepared when the time comes.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
