Zhao also promised China will proceed with political reform,which has lagged well behind decentralization of the economy.   Although the ruling party has made some effort to separate itswork from that of the government and replace arbitrarydecision-making with laws, the government remains mainly theexecutor of decisions made by a few top party leaders.   Economic and political restructuring should ``support eachother,'' the official Xinhua News Agency quoted Zhao as telling aTurkish delegation.   The tens of thousands of students who have held marches, sit-insand other protests the past three weeks have demanded the pace ofpolitical reform be stepped up and that basic freedoms such as theright to speak and a free press be protected. They also called foran end to worsening official corruption.   ``Many of the demands voiced by the students represent problemsthat the party and government are trying to solve,'' Zhao said,without mentioning specifics.   ``The situation (of the protests) has been prevented frombecoming acute because the party and government have all alongadopted a very tolerant and restrained attitude, and because moststudents have acted with increasing reason,'' he said.   Since a massive march Thursday on Tiananmen Square, many studentactivists have said they will change tactics and concentrate onspreading their message of democracy to the public rather thanmarching.   The only protest still continuing is a class boycott atprestigious Beijing University. Activists said about 70 percent ofthe school's more than 10,000 students remained out of class Monday.   Most other students in Beijing have ended the boycott, whichbegan April 24.   Beijing students also have continued to press their appeal for aformal dialogue with the government on political reform anddemocracy.   The Student Dialogue Representative Group, established by about30 universities to pursue a dialogue, met with officials at thegovernment reception department for nearly an hour Monday.   A member of the group said later the officials ``gave us a phonenumber and told us to call them by Thursday with our proposal for aspecific time and place.'' The student, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the group was not assuming this meant acceptancebut was preparing for talks anyway.   Xinhua reported late Monday that the head of the receptiondepartment, Zheng Youmei, told the students the government andparty would have ``broad contacts and dialogues with workers,peasants, intellectuals, students, teachers and people withnon-party affiliations.'' However, he stopped short of sayingwhether officials would meet with the Student DialogueRepresentative Group.   Various government officials have met with selected students inthe past nine days but have refused to recognize any of theindependent associations the students have formed since beginningtheir democracy movement April 15.   Instead, the government has sought to divide the students byfield. For example, Agriculture Minister He Kang met Sunday withabout 20 students of two agricultural schools and answered theirquestions about rural problems. He acknowledged not enough moneywas being invested in agriculture but offered no solutions,according to a report in Monday's official People's Daily.   The graduate student said such talks did not represent allBeijing students or cover the broad topics that the StudentDialogue Representative Group hopes to discuss.   The group also hopes for protracted talks, not a single meetinglimited to students asking questions.   Journalists for the official media also are pursuing a dialoguewith the government. Several hundred planned to present a petitionTuesday calling for talks on censorship and the dismissal of theeditor of china's most outspoken newspaper, the World EconomicHerald of Shanghai.   The editor, Qin Benli, was fired two weeks ago after refusing toalter an edition in keeping with government instructions.   Qin's firing and tight censorship of reports on the studentmovement prompted about 300 reporters to march with the studentsThursday in an unprecedented rebellion by members of China'sofficial media.</TEXT></DOC>
