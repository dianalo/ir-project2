Party leaders are upset that the upstart DemocraticRevolutionary Party has adopted the same three colors used for 60years by the governing party on its flags and emblems.   Red, white and green also happen to be Mexico's national colors.   Governing party leader Fernando Ortiz Arana said during ameeting of the Federal Electoral Commission on Friday that theparty's newly formed rival should be given 30 days to switchcolors, according to the Excelsior news service.   But Democratic Revolutionary Party leaders say the governingparty should not have a monopoly on the three colors Mexicansassociate with patriotism.   Herbert Castillo, a party leader and former presidentialcandidate of the Mexican Socialist Party, said his former party hadbeen allowed to use the colors red and green. The socialist partyis being absorbed by the Democratic Revolutionary Party.   ``We just want to add white now,'' Castillo said.   The new party is being formed by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a formergovernor of Michoacan state who came in second to governing partycandidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the July 1988 elections.Salinas took office in December.   The Electoral Commission, which is dominated by the governingparty, currently is holding hearings on the formation of the newparty.</TEXT></DOC>
