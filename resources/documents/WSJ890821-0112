But Mexico is going to have a long wait, until next April, before it learns whether the White House may remove the regular 1.6 cent-a-liter U.S. tariff rate for beer imports from that country.    In the meantime, Mexico and its brewing industry appear to be doing a pretty good business in exporting beer to the U.S., where Mexican brands have been popular in some markets and often command premium prices.    Mexico's beer exports to the U.S., even with the regular U.S. import duty, totaled about $196 million in 1987, $175 million in 1988 and about $54 million in the first five months of this year, according to the office of U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.    The U.S. cut off the duty-free treatment for beer from Mexico in 1982 after concluding that these imports no longer met the &quot;competitive needs&quot; test under the U.S. generalized system of preferences for imports from developing countries. At that time, U.S. brewers also were complaining about the competitive imports from Mexico.    Under the GSP program, which is subject to annual review, the U.S. decides each year whether to take various products off the duty-free list or to add items that the governments of developing countries or private business interests in the U.S. or abroad hope to get classified for U.S. duty-free treatment.    The Mexican government and two brewers in that country, Cerveceria Cuahtemoc and Cerveceria Moctezuma, have submitted petitions to the office of the U.S. trade representative requesting a waiver of the general restrictions in the GSP program that deny duty-free treatment for beer imports from Mexico.    The governments of Mexico and several other developing countries eligible for the special U.S. tariff concessions also are seeking U.S. duty-free treatment on many other products they would like to export in increasing volume. They include fruits and vegetables, chemicals, plastics, gloves and mittens, toilet paper, kitchenware, slide fasteners and numerous other consumer goods, as well as automatic data processing equipment, electronic products and automotive parts.    Petitions have been accepted from the governments of Peru, Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, the Philippines, Malaysia and other countries.    In addition, General Motors Corp. is seeking duty-free treatment for Mexican-manufactured electrical ignition or starting equipment for use on cars and trucks, while the Mexican affiliate of International Business Machines Corp. is supporting that country's efforts to gain duty-free status for digital automatic data processing machines.    However, not all of the petitions received from U.S. industries seek to broaden the tariff preferences for imports from developing countries.    U.S. trade-policy officials also will consider, for example, several petitions from U.S. steel wire rope and cable producers who want to take these imports off the list of eligible duty-free import items.    The U.S. battery trade council, another industry group, says 12 volt batteries also should be removed from the GSP list, while Hercules Inc., of Wilmington, Del., has asked that the current duty-free treatment for imports of cellulose nitrates be ended.    Between now and early next year, U.S. officials will be reviewing all of these petitions.    As part of this review, the U.S. International Trade Commission will hold public hearings in Washington in late September, where anyone who is interested, including representatives of the foreign governments, can argue for or against the changes in the GSP program that have been suggested by various petitioners.    The ITC role, as in previous reviews, will be to conduct fact-finding hearings. It will advise the White House later about the &quot;probable economic effect&quot; on U.S. industries, and on U.S. consumers, if, for example, waivers were to be granted to broaden the U.S. duty-free list for imports from developing countries, including Mexico.    U.S. trade officials noted that the Mexican beer petition may attract attention, but this isn't the most important single product category involved in the review.    For example, it was noted that the Mexican government also is seeking U.S. duty-free treatment for various types of railroad freight cars to be produced by constructors Nacional de Carros de Ferrocarril for sale to U.S. railroads.    The developing countries and various industry groups in these nations and the U.S. won't learn the final results of the annual GSP review exercise until next spring.    Technically, U.S. trade law requires President Bush to sign off by next April 1 on what changes should be made in the program, effective July 1, 1990.    The U.S. program of special tariff concessions for imports from more than 100 developing countries covers several thousand different products, including both manufactured goods and agricultural items.    The GSP program started back in 1976 and is slated to continue, under existing law, until July 4, 1993, with annual revisions in line with various technical criteria set by Congress.    Mexico and Brazil currently are two of the major beneficiaries of the GSP program.    During the administration of President Reagan, it was decided that such newly industralized countries as Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, once the main beneficiaries of the GSP program, should be &quot;graduated&quot; out of it.    U.S. imports from these major Asian exporters now are subject to the same tariffs that apply to imports of the same types of goods from industrial nations.    During the current review, U.S. officials will be considering other GSP-related issues, aside from adding products to the duty-free list or taking them off next July 1. They will consider, for example, alleged violations of workers' rights in such countries as Indonesia, Thailand, Nepal, the Dominican Republic, Benin, Haiti, Liberia and Syria.    They also will continue to study whether the U.S. should deny duty-free treatment for imports from Peru, Uruguay, Costa Rica or Venezuela. These countries have been named in petitions filed by various U.S. groups and companies as having expropriated private U.S. property without compensation. One of these cases was filed by Occidental Petroleum Co. against the government of Venezuela in 1988, but thus far there has been no decision by U.S. government officials that GSP treatment for imports from from that country should be denied. </TEXT></DOC>
