For the first time, issues of right andwrong, life and death on a global scale are being considered.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  STUDENT WAR JUNKIES HOOKED ON NEWS ABOUTCONFLICT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  WAR IN THE GULF  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;Every thought I have really comes back to the war,&quot; says Moulton, &quot;becausethis generation has never been through a war before.&quot;;    Together with fiveclassmates, Moulton organized an assembly on the Middle East just before thePersian Gulf war broke out. The young women had researched the topic forweeks, presenting both sides of a war they all had opposed before they begantheir study.;    Moulton has never wavered from her conviction that war iswrong, but some of her friends were surprised to find many of theirassumptions challenged by the contradictory information unearthed in theirresearch. And the more they learned, the less sure they were of anything.;   &quot;Before we did this, I could say where I stood,&quot; said Neda Pakdaman, 17, whohas relatives in Iran. &quot;After we did the research, it just confused me soincredibly. It's making me more depressed.&quot;;    Julie Zaslow, also 17,sympathized.;    &quot;It's harder to have all this information and differentviewpoints,&quot; she said. &quot;It's much easier to take your stand and not thinkabout it.&quot;;    Getting students to think is Kim Anzalone's job. In herContemporary World Issues class, Los Gatos High students look at the war everyday.;    &quot;What's going on in the news, what's the latest?&quot; Anzalone promptedher class on a recent day.;    For the next 15 minutes, the class dissectedthe most recent news, from the shooting of an American outside a Turkish airbase to the steady stream of Iraqi jets flying to Iran. One boy suggestedbombing Iranian airfields to destroy the jets. Another said that would be justthe excuse Iran would need to join the war. The class began buzzing with youngpeople offering their views.;    Anzalone beamed.;    &quot;Here they have anopportunity to spread their wings,&quot; she had explained earlier.;    On theother side of the valley, Gilda Mazzanti's eighth-grade history students atSan Jose's Burnett Middle School have been just as eager to speak theirminds.;    With Mazzanti guiding a freewheeling discussion during the first 10minutes of class, the bright 13- and 14-year-olds in sweat shirts and high-toptennies debated the issues of military censorship and environmental terrorismwith the assurance of informed adults. Many confess to having become warjunkies who rush home every afternoon to catch the latest news.;    &quot;Never inmy life,&quot; said Leslie Brown, &quot;have I been so aware of current events,interested in what's going on in the world.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ALETA WATSON, Mercury News Education Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910218  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  486  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday February 18, 199100049124,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
