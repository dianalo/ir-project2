(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Extremists in an ethnically torn regionof Soviet Georgia ambushed a police patrol, killing two cadets, andseized more than 1,500 weapons in raids on police stations acrossthe region, Soviet media said Saturday.   Troops patrolled the riot-torn Abkhazia region, where 19 peoplehave died in a week of violence between minority Abkhazians andethnic Georgians.   In the capital of Sukhumi, ``fear hangs over the city,'' theGeorgian newspaper Zarya Vostoka said.   ``The feeling is especially strong at night,'' the newspapersaid. ``That's when the gunfire starts in again and the noise isbreaking glass, revving tanks and explosions.''   The capital has been under a state of emergency since Tuesday.   As a result of the violence, two regional party secretaries werefired and two government leaders in Abkhazia lost their jobs, theofficial Tass news agency said.   The attack on the police patrol occurred Friday night in thevillage of Ostapi in Akbhazia, a Black Sea resort area.   Tass said assailants opened fire on the police patrol withhunting rifles, killing two cadets as they roadblocks andconfiscated weapons.   The violence reportedly was sparked by Abkhazian demands tosecede from Georgia.   Col. Gen. Yuri Shatalin, the commander of the all internalsecurity troops who rushed to the republic to take charge, told thegovernment newspaper Izvestia that Abkhazian and Georgianextremists had attacked eight police stations and two sports shopsin western Georgia over the past 24 hours.   ``As a result, 1,441 rifles are in the hands of extremists,'' hesaid.   Earlier attacks on police stations netted extremists hundreds ofweapons, including 56 submachine guns, 40 pistols and three machineguns, Izvestia said.   Shatalin blamed the seizure of the weapons on the ``careless ortreacherous behavior of police,'' apparently members of the localethnic groups. Since the strife began, police have confiscated morethan 2,700 firearms.   He described one battle between Abkhazians and Georgians on abridge in the village of Otap on the Ochamchirsky region lastSunday. ``There were 250 to 300 people from each side who took partin it,'' he said. ``I haven't seen such a battle since my servicein Afghanistan.''   Meetings between Abkhazians and Georgians took place in thecities of Sukhumi and Gagra on Friday, Izvestia said, but did notproduce any concrete results and were ``characterized by mutualreprimands.''   A plenum of the regional party committee of Abkhazia met andfired Mikhail A. Tsuladze and Said R. Tarkil from their jobs asCommunist Party secretaries, Tass said.   The Presidium of the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet fired Premier OtarZugbaya and his first deputy, V.M. Tsugba, Tass said. Thoserelieved of their posts appeared to include Abkhazians andGeorgians, although Tass did not specify their nationalities.   The Tbilisi newspaper Zarya Vostoka said the situation inSukhumi was tense and that industry was shut down and rail and citytransport halted by strikes, apparently by ethnic Georgianscomplaining that Abkhazians control all key jobs in the region.   It quoted the head of the railroad strike committee, MurmanFkhulukhia, as saying that Georgian leaders were ignoring theirdemands, which include the resignation of Abkhazian leaders,arrests of the instigators of violence and a change in thepersonnel policies of Abkhazia.   He said party leader Givi Gumbaridze came to listen to theirdemands at 3 a.m. last Monday. ``He heard us out, but since then,not a single one of our leaders _ party or government _ has come tosee us,'' he said. ``Aren't they interested in the fact that 750people are on strike, and as a result, the railroads are at astandstill?''   Thousands of tourists were being evacuated from the popularsummer resort are of Sukumi. ``The safety is fully ensured ofvacationing children and adults as they leaving Abkhazia,'' Tasssaid.   The news agency said violence also flared Friday in the Republicof Tadzhikistan in Central Asia, 1,500 miles southeast of Moscow,when a fight broke out between two men of different nationalities.   ``The fight grew into a conflict between two groups armed withchains, sticks and stones,'' Tass said. The battle ended whenpolice fired shots into the air, Tass said. Forty-three people weredetained.   The news agency did not identify the nationalities of thecombatants, although fighting was reported over water rights in therepublic earlier this month between Tadzhiks and Kirghiz. Bothnationalities are Moslem. The Kirghiz speak a Turkic dialect andthe Tadzhiks speak Persian.   At least 132 people have died in ethnic unrest during the pastmonth in the southern Soviet republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan,Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan.</TEXT></DOC>
