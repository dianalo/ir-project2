Brauchli   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>08/30/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C1</SO><CO>   JAPAN</CO><IN>BANKS (BNK)CDS, INTEREST RATES, COMMERCIAL PAPER (FIN)INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC NEWS AND STATISTICS (IEN)</IN><LP>   TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan boosted its benchmark interestrate Thursday, taking what some economists warned could be aninternationally risky step to avert inflation at home.   The central bank said it would raise its discount rate0.75 percentage point to 6.0%, effective immediately. Thediscount rate is the amount the central bank charges on loansto financial institutions.</LP><TEXT>   The increase was the fifth since authorities startedtightening official credit in May 1989. The last time thediscount rate was at this level was Dec. 11, 1981, when theBank of Japan lowered it to 5.5% from 6.25%.   More critically to the rest of the world, though, the ratechange was the first since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug.2 sent oil prices soaring and threw most countries' economicplans into limbo.   And Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno suggested itmight not be the last rate increase if the crisis continues.   Mr. Mieno said the central bank hoped its action wouldhelp sustain, not derail, economic growth. &quot;Under thesecircumstances at home and abroad we concluded that we had toact at this time to ensure continued stable growth,&quot; he said.   By raising the discount rate, the Bank of Japan said ithoped to ward off inflation at home. The bank said in astatement that the decision to raise the rate reflecteddomestic economic concerns, including a tight labor market,rapidly expanding money supply and rising money marketinterest rates. Unstated was the worry uppermost in manyofficials' minds here that high oil prices eventually couldtranslate into inflation in Japan, a country that imports 99%of its oil. People in Japan still refer to the 1973 and 1979oil crises as &quot;shocks.&quot;   But coming in the midst of the crisis in the Middle Eastand a slowing U.S. economy, some analysts warned that theBank of Japan's decision could prove too focused on domesticconcerns -- and harmful to the international economy.   &quot;If it causes any upward pressure in ratesinternationally, it could be very bad,&quot; said Keikichi Honda,director of economic research at Bank of Tokyo Ltd.   Japanese policy makers were presented with an agonizingconundrum. At issue was whether, with rates in the Japanesecredit market already rising, authorities should pushinterest rates higher. Higher interest rates probably willsucceed in forestalling inflation with the domestic economyexpanding rapidly -- many economists expect it to grow nearly5% this year. Japan's annualized inflation rate during June,as measured by the consumer price index, was 2.2%.   But Japan's effort to hold down its relatively tameinflation could be the nail in the U.S. economy's coffin whenmany are increasingly concerned about the possibility of aU.S. recession. Policy makers at the U.S. Federal Reservehave been leaning toward a modest easing of credit. Fedofficials suggest, however, that they won't move to cutshort-term interest rates until financial markets settledown.   Higher Japanese interest rates would compound Washington'sproblem by making it harder for the U.S. authorities to lowerrates. Japanese investors already have grown weary of fundingthe U.S. debt when they can obtain equivalent returns onJapanese government bonds.   In an interview before the rate change, Tomomitsu Oba,president of the Japan Center for International Finance and aformer vice minister of finance, warned that if Japan raisesrates too quickly, &quot;the world economy will be facing a very,very serious problem.&quot;   So delicate is the economic balance that analysts Thursdaymorning were speculating that Mr. Mieno, the central bankgovernor, must have discussed the rate change in advance withU.S. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. Mr. Mieno himself saidWednesday that he was taking &quot;international&quot; considerationsinto account in setting Japan's monetary policy. Bank ofJapan officials wouldn't elaborate on their statementannouncing the rate change.   The world's financial markets are acutely sensitive to thedangers, though. Rumors this week that the Bank of Japan wasconsidering a discount-rate increase pushed the yen to itshighest levels of the year. Wednesday, markets were upsetagain by leaks in the Japanese media that the central bankhad begun discussions with the Ministry of Finance on raisingthe rate by 0.75 percentage point to one point. The reportscited worries about the inflationary effects of higher worldoil prices resulting from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, andof tight labor conditions in Japan.   Although the Bank of Japan moved aggressively to squelchany such speculation, its announcement Thursday that the rateindeed would rise gave mild reassurance to the markets. Butthe stock market gave back most of its early gains, finishingup 34.68 points at 24929.47. It had been up more than 300points earlier.   &quot;They kind of caught people off guard after denying it&quot;Wednesday, said Mike Morizumi, a strategist in Tokyo forShearson Lehman Hutton Inc. &quot;But people are basicallyaccepting it.&quot;   Only a day earlier, reports of a possible increase in thediscount rate had crushed a three-session recovery on thebeleaguered Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Nikkei index plunged815.97 points, or 3.17%, to 24894.79.   Now, analysts say, the great fear is that Thursday's ratechange won't be the last. In a news conference Thursdaymorning, Mr. Mieno hinted that there could be more, sayingthat the situation in the Persian Gulf would require flexiblemonetary policy.   &quot;The prospect of war is so close,&quot; said Richard Koo, aneconomist at Nomura Securities Co.'s research affiliate. &quot;Itwould be much worse if they tried to raise rates now, a warstarts, oil prices rise, and they have to do it again.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
