(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Six months ago, Chinese students aroundthe world rallied by the thousands and hastily formed aidcommittees after the bloody government attack on demonstratingclassmates in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.   Today, foreign interest in their cause has waned, donations havefallen off and internal bickering over personalities and policy hashurt their credibility.   The exiled students watch wistfully as movements of the peoplesweep Eastern Europe's Communist parties from power _ and China'scontinuing crackdown from newspaper front pages.   Nonetheless, a core of activists, led by students who survivedthe June 3-4 army attack and fled overseas, are putting college andcareers on hold and exposing themselves and their families topolitical retribution to organize a long-term fight for democracyfrom exile.   ``It is our duty to speak before the whole world: Chinese peopleare suffering,'' said Li Lu, 23, one of only two students whoescaped in June while on the Chinese government's most-wanted listof 21 students. He now studies economics at Columbia University inNew York City but says his career will be fighting for human rightsin China.   ``I feel deeply guilty,'' said Li, pressing his hand to hisheart. His wife, whom he married amid the bright student banners inTiananmen Square, remains in China.   In world history, exile groups have a poor record of achievingchange at home. Prospects are especially bleak for the exiles fromChina, where many of the 1.1 billion people are semi-literatepeasants with little awareness of events abroad.   ``What we do here is limited,'' acknowledged An Wei, who camefrom Beijing to study and now works part-time at the ChinaInformation Center in the Boston suburb of Newton. The center wasset up in May to get news about Chinese political developments intoand out of China, including randomly faxing Western news reports toChinese offices.   ``Any change (in China) will have to happen from within. Butexternal pressure can have an impact,'' he said. ``If we send in100 faxes and only 10 get into the hands of concerned people, thatwill help.''   Results may be slow in coming, said 21-year-old Wu'er Kaixi, theother key student leader to escape. He is now studying at Harvard.   ``We must wait for a good opportunity. It could be DengXiaoping's death or another student movement or changes in themilitary,'' he said. ``When it comes, we have to be ready ... toreturn in a minute to China and play a role.''   Wu'er is one of the leaders of the Front for a Democratic China,founded in Paris in September and the most prominent of theoverseas Chinese activist groups.   In an underheated apartment in an aging frame house inSomerville, just outside Boston, Wu'er and fellow Chinese studentsrun the Front's main U.S. office. They write speeches for hisfrequent public appearances, lobby for foreign sanctions againstChina and plot to spirit other dissidents out.   From dozens of makeshift offices and homes across the UnitedStates and abroad, other exile groups also churn out news releasesand manifestos demanding democracy and smuggle anti-governmentmaterials into China.   A week ago, their goal of persuading foreign governments topressure China on human rights was dealt a blow by the trip toBeijing of National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, DeputySecretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger and a White House aide, thefirst high-level American officials to visit since the killings inJune. The Bush administration said the visit was meant to mendstrained ties between the two governments.   But even before Scowcroft's visit, many activists said they weredisappointed by the official American stance. The U.S. Consulate inHong Kong refused visas to many fleeing Chinese dissidents.President Bush has vetoed bills that tried to widen sanctionsagainst China and allow students to remain in the United Statesindefinitely.   Bush ordered administrative protection for Chinese students, butactivists remain dissatisfied, noting he is free to cancel theorder at any time.   Next to their visa status, financing is the main worry of theChinese groups, which share a scruffy, penny-pinched look.   The China Information Center is one of the better housed, in atwo-story frame house provided by an ecumenical religious group. Itpays rent when it can.   The Independent Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars,based in Washington, was formed by Chinese student groups on anumber of campuses around the country. In Chicago, six Chinesestudents tape daily half-hour programs of news and commentary thatare broadcast into China on shifting frequencies as ``The Voice ofJune 4.''   The movement's only newspaper to date is the Press FreedomHerald in Los Angeles. Yan Zhongmei, a Chinese visiting scholar inTokyo, has started a magazine, Democratic China.   Spiritual grandfather to all the groups is the Chinese Alliancefor Democracy, formed seven years ago by a Chinese studentdefector. From a small apartment in the New York City borough ofQueens, the Alliance publishes the anti-Communist magazine ChinaSpring.   The Alliance offers a sobering example to newcomers: although ithas found steady if sparse financial support and survived bitterinternal splits, it can claim to have influenced only small groupsof urban Chinese, despite efforts by underground members in China.   The newcomers realize that to do merely as well, they mustbecome better organized and work together, overcoming thehistorical tendency of Chinese groups abroad toward factionalism.Already, fellow exiles have criticized Wu'er in public for allegedimmaturity, and divisions have developed over whether the CommunistParty can be reformed from within.   They also must figure out how to introduce democracy in acountry with no tradition of popular participation in government.   ``The sad thing is everybody wants democracy and freedom, but ifyou ask them what kind of democracy, they can't answer,'' An said.   Yang Lixin, president of the Chinese Student Association ofColumbia University, said new groups such as the Front have yet todemocratize themselves. ``Very frequently, it is because (theexiles) learned about democracy from books,'' he said. ``They don'tknow how it works.''   They are trying to learn, in part through lobbying activities.   But many fear Americans will forget them, as they believe theU.S. government is doing.   In June, the China Solidarity Committee set up in Washington byFeng Shengping had seven full-time volunteers answering telephonecalls. ``Now one person can handle everything,'' he said.   Some say they have received vague warnings from Chineseofficials of eventual retribution, or their families in China havebeen questioned.   Feng predicts some activists will lose interest or be forced tofind paying jobs.   ``But some will stay, definitely, just like after a big tide isover, you still have rocks left behind,'' he said.   ``People like me have burned our bridges. If we want to go backto China to see our parents and friends, we have to promote thecause, or else we must stay here forever.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Dec. 17</NOTE></DOC>
