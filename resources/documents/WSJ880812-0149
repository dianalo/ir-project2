The immediate impact of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's decision Tuesday to force up interest rates has been to heighten pressure on West Germany to do the same. The Belgian central bank quickly raised its discount rate Wednesday, and French economists said the moves are likely to keep France from continuing to cut interest rates. {U.S. banks yesterday raised their prime rates a half-point to 10%.}   But in a sampling, economists and finance officials in major European capitals say they aren't yet revising downward their forecasts for next year. Slower growth for Europe has been predicted for some time, and many economists were expecting interest-rate increases. Many experts applaud the moves to nip inflation in the bud as well-timed and prudent.    At the same time, there is growing concern about the outlook, especially in West Germany, Europe's largest economy. The Bundesbank already has been forced to push through a series of interest-rate increases to support the flagging mark. In a news conference yesterday, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said a further increase in the value of the dollar could lead to higher West German interest rates. That would only add to pressures on the sluggish West German economy, and trouble there could ripple across Europe.    &quot;If the Bundesbank continues to move along a restrictive path, the outlook for the economy will begin to look dark,&quot; says Professor Rudiger Pohl, a Hagen University economist who is on a five-member advisory panel to the Bonn government. &quot;This weakness would then spill over into our neighboring countries.&quot;    Adds Ernst-Moritz Lipp, chief economist of Dresdner Bank AG in Frankfurt: &quot;If interest rates keep rising the way they have been in leading European economies, we are very likely to see a slowdown in European economic activity by the second half of 1989.&quot; But &quot;so far, we see no fundamental weakening in the business cycle.&quot;    Mr. Lipp expects West German economic growth to slow to about 2% in 1989 from an expected 3% for this year.    In Britain, which has raised interest rates seven times since June, economists applaud the increases as necessary to keep a lid on inflation, even though they are likely to slow growth across Europe next year. In Britain, inflation has been running at about 4.6%.    &quot;The cooling is a good thing,&quot; says Bill Martin, senior economist at Phillips andamp; Drew, a London stockbrokerage. &quot;The industrial countries are working this one very well. The inflationary risk was such that a rise in interest rates was required. They {the higher rates} don't presage a slide into recession.&quot;    He and other British economists haven't revised their growth forecasts following this week's increases in interest rates, which they expected. Economists are sticking with predictions that Britain's gross domestic product, or output of goods and services minus foreign income, will rise just 2% or 3% next year after rising about 4% this year.    Higher mortgage rates will slow Britain's growth next year. U.K. lenders recently raised their mortgage rates 1.75 percentage points to an average 11.5%.    Some economists say any slowdown in consumer spending could hit the construction and consumer durables industries particularly hard. But these economists generally don't fear a severe, consumer-led recession because high wage gains and falling unemployment continue to underpin the British economy.    French government officials and economists in Paris remain bullish on the outlook for France. &quot;There will be no change in France's economic policy, which favors cheap credit,&quot; a Finance Ministry official says.    But economists say the U.S. move will prevent France from achieving its goal of further reducing rates. France was running against the trend in most other European countries and had cut rates in May and July.    This was possible in part because French short-term interest rates are about two percentage points higher than West Germany's, when adjusted for inflation, so France could cut its rates without fearing an outflow of capital. But now, as pressure rises on Germany to raise its rates again, France has less margin of maneuver.    &quot;I'm confident for the next few months,&quot; says Philippe d'Arvisenet, an economist at Banque Nationale de Paris. &quot;As long as there's trust in the dollar and mistrust in the Deutsche mark, the franc will be protected.&quot; Moreover, he adds, the steady improvement in French corporate profits has increased French companies' ability to invest without borrowing, so rising interest rates wouldn't necessarily have a deep impact on economic growth.    Still, says J. Paul Horne, chief economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham in Paris, the rise in interest rates &quot;adds a bit of weight to a descending elevator&quot; because French economic growth, though strong, has been slowing slightly. But Mr. Horne says the world economy has sufficient momentum to weather a rise in interest rates if it is only a temporary, inflation-fighting measure. </TEXT></DOC>
