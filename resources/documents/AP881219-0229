(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Surgeons who corrected Nicolasa Menchu'sscoliosis used a magnet during the operation, stimulating her brainto make her limbs twitch and demonstrate that they hadn't damagedany nerves or arteries.   The surgery reduced the curvature of the 27-year-old Guatemalanstudent's spine to remove the pressure on her organs that kept themfrom functioning normally. The electromagnet, she says, ``saved mefrom being paralyzed.''   The spinal cord carries sensory signals to and from the brain.Doctors generally use small electric shocks to the limbs andelectrodes on the scalp to test whether the spine is intact andthose signals are getting through.   The use of the doughnut-shaped attached to the patient's headlets doctors to be more aggressive with some spinal procedures, saidDr. John R. Johnson, assistant professor of orthopedic surgery andco-director of the Kenton D. Leatherman Spine Center of Norton andKosair Children's hospitals.   About two years ago, Johnson and colleagues at the University ofLouisville School of Medicine heard that researchers in England werestimulating the brain with a pulsed magnetic beam to diagnosenervous-system disorders.   Because the magnet can trigger nerve cells in only the part ofthe brain that controls limb movement, they wondered if it might letthem test the spinal cord while avoiding some of the side effects ofelectrical stimulation.   In April 1987, they started testing magnetic stimulation on rats,then on themselves, students and secretaries _ about 60 volunteers.They found that the magnet triggered twitching of arms and legs ifplaced over the correct region of the brain. The muscle activity ismeasured and analyzed by a computer.   The doctors have used the procedure on 48 patients, and it hasfailed to trigger movement in about 20 percent. Harvey L. Edmonds,research director for the anesthesiology department, said anesthesiamay be suppressing those patients' leg muscles.   ``I'm very enthusiastic about it,'' said Dr. Susan Porter, ananesthesiologist who has used the technique in about 20 operationsat the University of Kansas medical center. Porter said she foreseesother uses for the magnet, such as in monitoring the sciatic nerveduring hip surgery.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Dec. 22</NOTE></DOC>
