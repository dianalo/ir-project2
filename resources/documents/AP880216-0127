Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,chairman of the Armed Services Committee.   ``I do think there is a consensus for the modernization ofshort-range nuclear weapons,'' but there is no agreement yet onspecifically which weapons to build, he said.   Nunn and Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., were among agroup of key senators who visited U.S. allies in Europe last weekas part of the Senate's consideration of the Intermediate-rangeNuclear Forces treaty negotiated two months ago by President Reganand Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.   The treaty would eliminate medium-range missiles on both sides,but would allow both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and theWarsaw Pact to build nuclear weapons with a range of less than 300miles.   Byrd told reporters that European leaders told the senators``that the INF treaty should be approved without amendments andthat following that, NATO should procede with modernizing thoseground-based nuclear weapons that are eligible under the treaty.''   ``The general consensus was that the allies should not go forthe third zero option,'' said Byrd, referring to calls from someEuropean politicians for the total elimination of nuclear weapons.   ``They should plan to improve the range of those short-rangetheater weapons that would be allowed, and not emphasize themodernization of short-range artillery-type weapons.'' said Byrd.   But Nunn, at the reopening of hearings by his committee on thetreaty, said NATO needs to decide specifically what type ofshort-range weapons to build.   The options include nuclear-tipped artillery shells, which havea range of 15 or 20 miles, and longer-range weapons, such as theLance missile.   In 1983, NATO ministers agreed to build a new generation ofshort-range weapons, but that decision has not been implemented.   The Reagan administration has urged NATO to improve itsnon-nuclear weapons to offset Soviet numerical advantages inconventional weapons. The alliance has long relied on thepossibility of using nuclear weapons to deter a Soviet attack.   Edward L. Rowny, one of Reagan's top arms control advisers, toldNunn's committee Tuesday that ``Soviet officials have franklyadmitted to me that the cutting edge of their political andmilitary power lies in their conventional forces.''   ``They may be attempting to mesmerize the West with nuclearreductions while protecting the utility of their conventionalsuperiority,'' Rowny said.   Another witness, Ronald Lehman, who helped negotiate the INFpact, noted that ``a substantial number of U.S. nuclear weaponswill remain in Europe'' after the INF treaty.   But NATO has never had a ``politically easy'' time when it builtnew nuclear weapons, Lehman said.   ``Undoubtedly, the Soviet Union hopes that a new arms controlagreement will have a soporific effect on Western security concernswhich will weapon NATO's defenses,'' he said.   Retired Army Gen. Bernard Rogers, former supreme allliedcommander, told the Foreign Relations Committee that NATO shouldbuild a number of new short-range atomic weapons.   They include an air-to-ground missile, new artillery shells, andan updated version of the Lance, Rogers said.   He also urged approval of what he said are ``low-cost'' stepsNATO could take, including a comprehensive arms control strategy.   Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser under PresidentCarter, told the Armed Services Committee ``it would be a mistake''to go along with efforts to negotiate for the elimination of allnuclear weapons.   Meantime, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said the Democraticleadership will go ahead and offer an amendment proposed by Sen.Joseph Biden, D-Del., that would require the administration toadhere to the view of the treaty outlined by administrationwitnesses.   Biden recently underwent surgery and is not expected to returnto work before the treaty comes up for a vote, Cranston said.   The proposal stems from an ongoing dispute between theadministration and congressional Democrats over how to interepretthe 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. Democrats want a``narrow,'' or restrictive, interpretation, while theadministration has said it has the right to move to a ``broad''interpretation that would allow tests of Reagan's Star Warsanti-missile program.   Secretary of State George Shultz recently wrote Nunn and Byrdthat administration witnesses are speaking authoritatively, meaningthat some future administration won't be able to change its view ofthe what the treaty means.</TEXT></DOC>
