Bilinski.andP;  The standard contractsalso have effectively brought about greater standardization withinthe Air Force because the machines were very current and very goodtechnology as well as lower in cost.andP;  The contracts expire Feb 28and Desktop III, the follow-on contract probably will not becomplete until Jun 1989 or after.andP;  Departments and agencies mustplan their orders to account for that gap, Bilinski says.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     United States.

 I asked the staff to go look atall the microcompumters that had been purchased under Z-100 and Z-248 and themicros purchased off what I call non-standard contracts.andM;On the average, per unit the standard Air Force requirements contracts weregiving us these microcomputers at about $1,200 lower than non-standard ones.andM;The other things these requirements contracts have done is allowed us a veryquick method of obtaining standardization in microcomputers within the AirForce.andM;First, because those  computers represented very current and very goodtechnology, they were attractive to the users.andP;  And they were inclined ratherthan to seek a waiver to use that microcomputer contract to get that newtechnology.andP;  Second, they were inclined to do it because the prices were farlower than other contract vehicles that they had.andM;GCN: Are you seeing the improvement in productivity that you expected fromthe infusion of that much computing power?andM;BILINSKI: I think so.andP;  You need to remember that not every microcomputer thatwas purchased off the Z-248 or the laptop computer or the Z-100 is used inthe Air Force.andP;  As a matter of fact, if you look at the current Z-248contract, of the three services the Air Force has purchased less than theNavy and the Army.andM;The Army really has the lead.andP;  The last time I checked they had purchasedprobably 20,000 more units than the Air Force had.andM;The productivity gains are very apparent.andP;  Let me give you two examples; oneis a personal example.andP;  We have computers here in the office and everyone hasone on their desk.andP;  We have five professionals being supported by oneadministrative secretary.andP;  When I got here we had two professionals beingsupported by one secretary, and she was busy, absolutely busy, all the time.andM;And let me tell you one short story about a very simple cargo managementsystem that I had the opportunity to see out at the Military Airlift Command[MAC].andP;  A young tech sergeant received a Z-100 several years ago.andP;  Heprogrammed a system that all of MAC uses today for cargo management inloading aircraft -- C-103s, C-141s and C-5s.andM;And essentially what this system does is you key in dimensions of each box oreach pallet and the individual weight of each pallet and size in terms ofwhat you want to load on the airplane.andP;  And this little computer system willallocate -- based on its weight and size -- an optimal location on theaircraft for each of the boxes.andM;And it will then put out an inventory list that will tell you the order inwhich you should put it on the plane in exactly what location.andP;  It also thencalculates the center of mass for the aircraft.andP;  And it also will tell youhow much additional cargo you can put on the plane.andP;  If you change a box onthe airplane it will reallocate and redistribute everything -- and almostinstantaneously.andM;This job that took the cargo managers, the senior non-commissioned officers,four to fiver hours to do for a C-141 or for a C-5A is now done in less thanhalf an hour, and it's very responsive to changes.andP;  What that means is thatthose teams of cargo management personnel can service and plan for many moreairlifts than they previously could.andM;GCN: What happens between the ending of Z-248 and the beginning of itsfollow-on, Desktop III?andM;BILINSKI: Obviously that's going to be a big problem.andP;  Our last date forordering equipment off the existing contract is the 28th of February.andP;  We'reprojecting an award of Desktop III in the June time frame.andP;  Now if we happento get somewhere between 10 and 20 separate proposals, it's going to takemore time and staff to evaluate those proposals, so that award date could infact be even later.andM;It will then be necessary for the military departments and agencies to do oneof two things.andP;  One, they can anticipate their ordering requirements in theperiod between March 1st and, say the end of June, and they can submit anorder in February.andP;  Second, they can wait for the award of Desktop III.andP;  Thethird alternative is that they can do a separate acquisition.andM;GCN: For separate acquisitions would you insist Air Force buyers get thestandard micro, say a Zenith, off the schedule contract?andM;BILINSKI: No, I think we'd have some problems specifying a make and model inthe interim period.andP;  I don't think that would be wise.andP;  We are going to putout a policy letter that says that certain capabilities and features on thesemicrocomputers that get acquired in the interim have to conform with variousaspects of our communications and computer architecture.andM;GCN: When you developed the final Desktop III specifications, you droppedOS/2 as a requirement.andP;  Why?andM;BILINSKI: We had to apply a test to that specification: because OS/2 is aproprietary product, were manufacturers and vendors other than IBM able toprovide it?andP;  And was OS/2 equally accepted across the commercial marketplace,and was it at that time a de facto standard?andP;  And the answer was no.andP;  We didnot feel that it was a de facto standard.andP;  We did not feel that it wassufficiently available from a wide variety of hardware vendors.andM;And we felt that it would be contrary to the Competition in Contracting Act.andO;Clearly, we had to make a decision as to whether or not that specificationwas going to be defendable in a protest.andM;Finally, was there a distinct military requirement that demanded OS/2, andwas it sufficiently documented and was it defensible? Again the answer tothat question turned out to be no, and so we had to abandon OS/2 as amandatory requirement.andM;GCN: Consider AFCAC 251 for a moment.andP;  With the progress the Air Force hasmade in local area networks and powerful micros, why do you need 20,000minicomputers?andM;BILINSKI: The 20,000 really is spread across all the military departments,and it has about 2,000 for non-DOD agencies -- we included that estimate atthe request of the General Services Administration.andP;  You need to rememberthat some of those systems are two- and three- person systems.andP;  At the ratethe Air Force has been automating, I can truly see a need for the 20,000throughout government.andM;For the Z-100 contract, we thought that we would buy about 10,000.andP;  In factwhen that contract was over, the number was actually over 40,000.andP;  On theZ-248 our estimated quantity was 90,000, and in fact it will be almost310,000 when we're all done.andM;We've consistently shown that the appetite for the technology, given the lowunit prices, comes up with far greater numbers of actually demanded systemsas opposed to estimates.andM;GCN: The ATandamp;T 3B2 is a fairly recent model but the processor technology isfairly old.andP;  You've been criticized for taking the &quot;safe route.&quot;andP;  Is that afair comment?andM;BILINSKI: I don't think we took a safe route at all.andP;  I think in the analysisof the different vendor proposals -- and there were very many aspects as youwell know, technical aspects that were evaluated -- the processor speed andarchitecture was only one.andP;  The peripheral capabilities, the ability of thesystem to support various interfaces with other systems, compatibility, thesoftware capabilities, all went into that equation on the award.andM;And overall the Air Force chose the best technical solution that was providedby industry.andP;  So anyone that tells you that we did not choose the besttechnical solution simply does not understand the facts.andM;GCN: In the 251 acquisition you were able to specify System V InterfaceDefinition compliance and fight off a challenge to that.andP;  Everyone thoughtother agencies would follow your lead on SVID, but we haven't seen that.andP;  Forinstance, the Treasury Department looked like it would but ended upspecifying Posix compliance.andP;  Has this surprised you?andM;BILINSKI: No, I am not surprised.andP;  I can assure you that the protest thatDigital Equipment Corp. and Wang Laboratories Inc. submitted caused the AirForce to expend probably more effort than any other single acquisition of thesame dollar value.andP;  That was a large investment, and many other governmentagencies and departments simply do not have the numbers of people and thetop-level management time.andM;So it's easier to not take the route the Air Force has done.andP;  I wasdisappointed that the Treasury acquisition did not follow, but I understand.andM;GCN: In the almost four years you've been in the Air Force, how would you saythe Air Force computing environment has changed?andM;BILINSKI: If you look at the total Air Force C4 -- command, control,communications and computer -- budget, which for the last seven years has runat about $7 billion a year, in four years we've purchased almost $30 billionworth of capability.andP;  We've had almost a quantum leap in technologycapability because we've had several back-to-back acquisitions that wereawarded and quickly produced technology capability.andM;GCN: If you had stayed on, where would you have focused your attention?andM;BILINSKI: I would focuse on base-level systems integration: getting theindividual system capabilities that now exist on individual base-levelsystems to interface together such that information is electronicallytransferred between the different base-level locations that need thatinformation.andM;I would push very hard for a standard wing command and control system [WCCS]there are several prototype WCCS systems that currently are underdevelopment.andP;  In a war the wing commander is the most important person at anAir Force base.andP;  He is the one that gets tasking through the Air Forcehierarchy that comes from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the president.andP;  Iwould like to see the wing command and control system get thatelectronically.andM;The WCCS system would be able to transmit back status of forces information,essentially the status of how successful the combat sorties have been -- howdid we do, what are our losses, what is our operational readiness, how manyplanes did we lose, how many sorties can I fly in six hours, how much fuel doI have? -- all of that electronically.andM;The second thing the WCCS system would do is it would be the central focalpoint at the base level for the wing commander to electronically know thecapability of the rest of the base.andM;The ability to fly a sortie depends on the information on many computersystems.andP;  It depends on the status of munitions from the Air Force CombatAmmunition System.andP;  It depends on the maintenance people that are trying tofix an airplane and get it ready for operational status.andP;  We need tointegrate that horizontally.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
