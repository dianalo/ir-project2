No injuries were reported. Witnesses said they saw armed mendressed in civilian clothes detain one student during the two-hourclash on a street between the University of Panama and the Arts andTrades College.   Police fired tear gas to try to break up the protest. At leasttwice, the students, from 13 to 16 years old, picked up unexplodedcannisters and tossed them back at police. Several policemen werevisibly affected by the gas.   A torrential rain ended the demonstration.   Students said they blocked Bolivar Street to protest theindefinite closing of two high schools in Chiriqui, in the westernpart of the country, and one in Colon, 50 miles north of PanamaCity, after anti-government demonstrations last week.   The Education Ministry has warned that it will close any schoolwhere there are disturbances in the weeks before the scheduledchange of government Sept. 1.   One student died and several others were injured at theuniversity Aug. 3 when police fired birdshot to break up ademonstration.   Acting President Manuel Solis Palma's term expires Sept. 1, butthe lack of a successor threatens to create a vacuum in thegovernment.   International observers say the opposition defeated thegovernment presidential candidate by a landslide in May 7 elections,which the government annulled.   The opposition is demanding its victory be recognized so it cantake power and that Noriega step down as chief of the DefenseForces, a post that makes him the country's de facto leader.   Government and military representatives have refused bothdemands, but continued talks with the opposition on Wednesday.   An Organization of American States mission that has beenmediating the talks is to report on progress on Aug. 23.   Noriega was indicted in Florida on U.S. drug trafficking andmoney laundering charges. He denies the charges.</TEXT></DOC>
