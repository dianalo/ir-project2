Oxford First, a mortgage-banking and financial-services concern, agreed last May to be acquired by the closely held Cawsl, a Wynnewood, Pa.-based holding company.    Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Oxford First common closed at $24.25, up 50 cents.    Separately, Oxford First said it had bought an $80 million portfolio of mortgages created by the sale of homesites in Nevada and Colorado by Preferred Equities Corp., based in Las Vegas, Nev. Oxford added that Fidelity Bank, a Philadelphia unit of Fidelcor Inc., and Provident National Bank of Philadelphia, a unit of PNC Financial Corp. in Pittsburgh, each purchased a 25% participation in the portfolio from Oxford. </TEXT></DOC>
