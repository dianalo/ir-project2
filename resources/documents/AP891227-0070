Pro-Ceausescu security police today attacked Bucharesttelevision headquarters, where the provisional government wasbased, but were driven off by army units supporting the revolution.   ``After a gunbattle of a half an hour, the army regained firmcontrol of the situation,'' Hungary's MTI news agency reported fromthe scene.   MTI said the army was in control of most of the capital but thatthere were fears the security police would strike again.   Overall, however, things appeared to be quiet, and businessesand factories began resuming operations after the 12-day-longrevolt that ousted Ceausescu after 24 years of strict Communistrule.   The governing National Salvation Committee demanded thatsecurity police surrender by Thursday and indicated they face thesame fate as Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, if they do not.   The government set up military courts Tuesday to try members ofCeausescu's vicious security police.   Ion Iliescu, named president by the governing National SalvationCommittee, today defended the secrecy surrounding the Ceausescus'trial and execution on Christmas Day.   ``We are people carried away by a very spontaneous process. Sothere was a general demand which pushed us to follow thisprocess,'' he told French television. He said the security policecould have tried to rescue Ceausescu.   Romania's Agerpres news agency said Tuesday night that Romania'sinterim leaders set up special military courts to try ``all casesof terrorist acts'' and said sentences would be carried out``immediately.''   It said the interim government demanded all members of thesecurity police surrender by Thursday afternoon or they will be``tried and condemned.''   Romanian television Tuesday night showed the first videotapefootage of the trial of Ceausescu and his wife.   ``Everything that was said here is false, and I don't want totalk anymore,'' Ceausescu told his accusers, insisting he was stillin power and refusing to acknowledge either the severe hardships heforced on his people or the massacre of thousands of people by hissecurity forces.   Earlier in the day, state television showed pictures of thebullet-riddled bodies of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu, who wassecond-in-command in Romania.   Ceausescu, unrepentant right up until his execution, did nottolerate even the mildest dissent in 24 years of rule, and manyRomanians are concerned that the bloody 12-day-old revolution thattoppled him will not lead to democracy.   Iliescu, in a speech Tuesday night, stressed that the 37-memberNational Salvation Committee intends to govern only until ``newstructures'' can be established under a new constitution.   The leadership promised free elections in April, which would bethe first in Romania since 1937.   The committee, comprised of dissidents, disaffected governmentofficials and army commanders, has run the short and bloodyrevolution since taking over television headquarters Friday.   Sporadic gunfire still rang out through parts of the capitalafter proof of the execution was broadcast, but Bucharest radio andRomanian sources said Ceausescu loyalists were surrendering by thehundreds.   Many buildings in Bucharest were burned out or pocked by thethousands of bullets and shells fired in earlier battles betweenthe army _ which sided with the people _ and security forcessniping from windows and rooftops.   The provisional government appointed its leaders on Tuesday andsaid it was repealing many hated laws that held Romanians in astraitjacket of repression, including one that required theregistration of all typewriters.   Some members of newly founded political parties demanded thatall Communists be excluded from the government.   The committee said Iliescu, 59, a senior Communist officialuntil his demotion by Ceausescu, would remain chairman as well aspresident. Petre Roman, a 43-year-old professor of hydroengineeringwith no political background, was named prime minister.   In one of the government's first acts, Iliescu and DefenseMinister Gen. Nicolae Militaru ordered the dreaded state securitydepartment placed under the jurisdiction of the defense agency,leaving only traffic police, firefighters and prison guards underthe jurisdiction of the Interior Ministry.   Other decrees repealed laws forbidding unauthorized contact withforeigners and requiring the intelligentsia to live in the samecity where they work _ a statute frequently used to banish criticalvoices to remote towns.   ``What we have achieved so far is to solve only emergencyproblems,'' Prime Minister Roman told the Soviet television newsprogram ``Vremya.''   ``The questions I'll be dealing with are connected withrestoration of the economy under new conditions.''   In a late night television address reported by Agerpres, Romansaid his new government would be formed ``quite soon.''   ``We are not in a desparate situation,'' he was quoted assaying. But he noted that ``the Ceausescu clique'' left the economya ``disaster.''   ``The economy and social organization were ... at (the) beck andcall of two primitive minds, with no perspective, but with thethirst for power,'' Roman said of the Ceausescus.   At his trial, the 71-year-old Ceausescu lashed out at hisaccusers as the charges were read against him and refused to replywhen asked who ordered that demonstrators be shot on Dec. 17 in thewestern city of Timisoara, where the revolt began.   ``This was a coup d'etat, and I don't answer your questions,''he said.   The Ceausescus were convicted of killing more than 60,000 peopleduring their years in power, stashing more than $1 billion inforeign banks and ruining the national heritage and economy.   Romania's standard of living has plunged in recent years becauseof Ceausescu's harsh campaign to pay off the foreign debt, whichincluded exporting the vast bulk of the nation's crops.   A military officer who asked not to be identified said 300soldiers volunteered for the firing squad to kill the former rulingcouple but only three were chosen. The Ceausescus' were grantedtheir last wish, to die together, the officer said.   ``Down with tyranny!'' a radio announcer proclaimed after theexecutions. ``Romania is free ... the supreme moment has come.''   For some, death was not enough.   ``He should be stripped naked, and his body paraded through thestreets,'' said Dimitru Minca, 70, whose 14-year-old grandson wasamong those killed in the unrest.   The Ceausescus were reportedly captured in an underground bunkerafter fleeing the capital in a helicopter. Their son and daughter,Nicu and Zoia, and other family members were arrested andreportedly face trial.</TEXT></DOC>
