The report prepared by the State Department concluded that companies in France, Italy and Israel were selling arms to Pretoria, probably &quot;with the knowledge of their governments,&quot; a department official said. However, after the report emerged from a White House review Wednesday night for submission to Congress, the reference to the probable knowledge of the three governments was omitted.    The report also said that companies in West Germany, Britain, the Netherlands and Switzerland violated the embargo &quot;without government permission,&quot; or by selling equipment in &quot;the gray area between civilian and military application.&quot; This category was left unchanged by the White House.    The Reagan administration also delayed submitting the report to Congress until yesterday, missing an April 1 deadline. One official said this was done in part to limit embarrassment for French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, who completed a visit to Washington Wednesday night. The State Department had cleared the report for transmittal to Capitol Hill about 7 p.m. EST Wednesday, but it wasn't sent to the lawmakers until midday yesterday.    The report was mandated by Congress under an anti-apartheid law that was passed last year over President Reagan's veto. The measure imposed economic sanctions on South Africa as a means of pressuring its minority-white government into dismantling its system of racial separatism.    The amendment requiring the report vaguely threatens to cut U.S. military aid to any country that is violating the 1977 U.N. arms embargo. Israel receives $1.8 billion in military aid from the U.S., but lawmakers say that a cutoff is extremely unlikely. Last month, Israel announced that it wouldn't sign any new military contracts with South Africa and that it was considering severing certain cultural ties between the two states.    The administration submitted a three-page unclassified report to Congress, as well as a longer classified version. The unclassifed version said that South Africa has reacted to the embargo by building &quot;a large and sophisticated indigenous arms industry.&quot; It said that Pretoria imports weapons systems or parts when it can't make the items itself, or can't arrange for a licensing-manufacturing arrangement in South Africa. The report said that because the arms imports are &quot;small and difficult to detect&quot; it was impossible to estimate the volume of shipments. </TEXT></DOC>
