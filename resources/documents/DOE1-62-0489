The amountof H/sub 2/O partial pressure during the cleaning procedure is determinedby the absorption of the microwave power with corresponding rotationalspectra of 22.235 GHz for water molecules. By applying this method, itis possible to measure the relatively high gas pressure (up to 100 Pa)encountered during the cleaning. The rate of H/sub 2/O production andthe time history of H/sub 2/O during the cleaning are monitored and theefficiency of the reduction of H/sub 2/O is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
