Gorbachev has emerged from his fourthsuperpower summit with little to show for it on paper. But heappears to have persuaded a longtime adversary he is sincere in hispledge to build a new relationship with the West.   President Reagan, in what was most probably his last U.S.-Sovietsummit, took back his notorious characterization of the Soviet Unionas an ``evil empire'' and heralded the beginning of ``a new era inhistory, a time of lasting change in the Soviet Union.''   Though short on tangible achievement, the latest talks betweenReagan and Gorbachev produced a mood of good will and talk of mutualinterest. ``Momentous,'' Reagan called it.   From their first meeting, in 1985, came ``the spirit of Geneva,''in which the two great nuclear powers took a tentative step towardeach other after years of cold stares and bluster.   In Reykjavik, Iceland, the following year, they rushed toward adisarmament pact, finding agreement on broad statements ofprinciple. But the meeting collapsed in disappointment felt 'roundthe world when the two leaders hit an impasse over the future of``Star Wars.''   Washington, last December, saw the triumphant signing of thefirst treaty to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons, thoseborne by medium- and shorter-range missiles, and both sides lookedforward to even greater achievement in Moscow. There, both sidessaid, they hoped the two leaders could sign an agreement to cuttheir long-range nuclear arsenals in half.   As at Reykjavik, however, they stumbled again over ``Star Wars,''Reagan's visionary program to develop a space-based defense againstnuclear attack. But this time, neither side seemed particularlydisappointed.   As he welcomed the American president to the Kremlin, Gorbachevtold Reagan, ``It is better to see once than to hear a hundredtimes.'' And for Reagan, his first visit to the Soviet Unioncertainly was an eye-opener.   After building a political career on staunch anti-communism andopposition to practically every accord between the two superpowers,Reagan returned home convinced that the reforms Gorbachev is tryingto implement will change the character of the United States' ColdWar enemy.   ``The events of this week in Moscow were momentous,'' he said.``Not conclusive, perhaps, but momentous. And believe me, right now,momentous will do just fine.''   A senior American official, who has watched the pitch and yaw ofU.S.-Soviet relations for many years, said Reagan's conversationswith Gorbachev appeared to break down the Soviet leader's typicallyRussian suspicion about his guest's intentions.   ``He is more convinced, not just intellectually but in the gut,that the American people do not really represent a threat,'' theofficial said of Gorbachev.   Reagan said that he found Gorbachev ``different than previousSoviet leaders.'' As for the ``evil empire,'' he said, that was``another time, another era.'' Reagan used the term to describe theSoviet Union in March 1983, two years before Gorbachev rose to power.   ``We must not stop here,'' Reagan said after his fourth and finalday of summit talks.   And Gorbachev told a news conference the same day that it is``vitally necessary'' that superpower summitry continue, albeitprobably with the retiring president's successor.   Both sides seemed prepared to look beyond their problems with anew arms accord to continue building bridges for improvedunderstanding.   ``Let us look at one another with open eyes; let us see eachother's history, traditions and values,'' Gorbachev said. ``Let usrespect each other's choice, respect our peoples.''   Reagan, too, sensed a change not just at the negotiating tablebut in national attitudes.   ``Quite possibly, we are beginning to take down the barriers ofthe postwar era,'' he said. ``Quite possibly we are entering a newera in history, a time of lasting change in the Soviet Union.''   Even on human rights issues, which at one point appeared tothreaten the cooperative spirit, Gorbachev appeared willing to seeknew approaches, and Reagan muted his criticism by blaming the Sovietbureaucracy for the slow pace of Jewish emigration.   ``The American administration does not have an understanding ofthe real situation with human rights, with the processes that aretaking place in our country in the sphere of democracy.'' the Sovietleader told reporters. ``Probably we, too, do not have a clearunderstanding of the American situation in this sphere of life.''   He said he suggested to Reagan that the two nations hold alawmakers' seminar to exchange views on the subject.   He also praised his own country's press for reporting on Reagan'smeeting with dissidents and Jews who have been refused permission toleave the country.   ``This part of the president's visit had to be shown to ourpeople,'' he said. ``The people should know everything.''   Because Soviet television carried some of the summit events live,the people did see and hear much more about American conduct andU.S. policy than is normally available to them. Some even got ataste of Western news programming when they discovered they couldpick up Cable News Network broadcasts, which were beamed into Moscowfor officials and journalists during the summit.   As for a new strategic arms reduction treaty, Reagan's nationalsecurity adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin Powell, indicated that is just amatter of time.   ``We have to take this slowly,'' he said. ``This is too importantto rush.''   In the meantime, Powell said, the relationship between the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union ``is solidly in place without a lot ofups and downs, without too many sharp turns that cause people tohave anxiety.''   ``It is a fairly stable, maturing, growing relationship,'' headded, ``and I think it's a relationship that will be built on bythe next administration, regardless of which party wins the electionin the fall.''   Gorbachev suggested that the real key to the future lies indeveloping economic ties between the two nations, not just informulating acceptable treaty language on reducing weaponry.   ``The more we depend on each other economically,'' he said, ``themore we will be predictable on the political plane.''</TEXT></DOC>
