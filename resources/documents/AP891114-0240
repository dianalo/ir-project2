But others on Capitol Hill welcome the change at thegovernment's principal consumer protection agency, with oneconsumer group calling Young ``by far the worst FDA commissioner''in the past 18 years.   Young, who has been FDA commissioner since July 1984, will leavethe agency next month to take another top position within theDepartment of Health and Human Services.   The new job, deputy assistant secretary for health handlingscience and environmental matters, is an expansion of a vacant postin the Public Health Service. FDA is part of the Public HealthService.   Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., ranking Republican on the HouseEnergy and Commerce investigations subcommittee, said Young ``waspart of the solution, not part of the problem'' at FDA. He said hefeared Young's departure would be a setback in efforts to makeneeded reforms at the agency.   The department has not announced a replacement for Young. Butunlike Young and his predecessors who were appointed by the HHSsecretary, the next FDA commissioner will have to be confirmed bythe Senate, which could lengthen the time it will take for areplacement to take over.   Sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said theybelieved Young was being forced out in the fallout over the scandalthat uncovered fraud, corruption and mismanagement within the FDA'sgeneric drug division and the generic industry.   Department officials, however, discounted the speculation asunfounded rumor and said Young was eager to take the new job, eventhough the move is a lateral one.   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the panel, said hedidn't blame Young for the FDA's generic drug problems, which ledto bribery convictions of several FDA employees and drug companyofficials along with disclosures that some companies cheated onproduct safety tests.   ``His intentions were good and he did his best when problemswere brought to light. But he was handicapped by the budgets andattitudes of an administration that let the agency go to seed,''Dingell said.   But Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the House GovernmentOperations subcommittee on human resources, said: ``Under extremepressure from the Reagan-Bush White House, Frank Young oversaw theerosion of FDA as an independent watchdog agency. As a result, theAmerican public has lost the confidence in FDA's ability to protectconsumers from unsafe foods and drugs.''   Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health ResearchGroup, called Young ``by far the worst FDA commissioner in the 18years since Ralph Nader and I started the Health Research Group.''   He said Young ``has been more concerned with protecting theindustries FDA is supposed to regulate than in protecting thepublic from these industries.''   The FDA is one of the most visible government agencies,responsible for assuring the safety of drugs, cosmetics and mostfood products.   Department officials denied that the generic drug scandal hadanything to do with the changes. In fact, the department'sannouncement that Young will move into the new position Dec. 18praised his handling of the generic drug problems.   ``All of the rumors are just that _ typical Washingtonnonsense,'' said James Brown, a spokesman for the Public HealthService.</TEXT></DOC>
