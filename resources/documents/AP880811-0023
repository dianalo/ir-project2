VERNACI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republicans dispensed with a bitterdelegation fight and turned back a request to make the partystructure more open to minorities as they cruised toward nextweek's convention with sharpened attacks on the Democrats.   ``When I look up there and don't see a black face, I getsuspicious,'' Lugenia Gordon, a 67-year-old black Republican fromNew York City, told the Republican National Committee on Wednesday.   ``It seems to me that the Republican Party looks at us likeLimburger cheese _ a little bit of us goes a long way,'' said Ms.Gordon, who was speaking on behalf of an appeal from a groupcalling itself Freedom Republicans that urged the party to includemore minorities in the party structure.   The RNC rejected the proposal.   RNC Chairman Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. sought to focus the party'sattacks on the Democrats, saying they have no right to get upsetover Republican criticism.   Fahrenkopf cited George Bush's appearance ealier in the weekbefore the GOP platform committee when the vice president referredto Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis as ``the stealth candidate''and said the Massachusetts governor was invisible on the issues.   ``Dukakis is already crying foul,'' Fahrenkopf said in a speechto the RNC, which was meeting less than a week before the party'snational convention. ``But how can Dukakis call this negativecampaigning and go unchallenged?   ``Yes, the vice president's remarks were critical. ... But thevice president used a memorable rhetorical device to make a pointgrounded in fact _ that Dukakis will not discuss the issues,'' hesaid.   Also on Wednesday, the committee settled a bitter six-monthfight in Georgia, where two groups wrestled for control of thestate's 48-member delegation to the national convention.   In the end, a faction that included supporters of televisionevangelist Pat Robertson along with dissident party members won amajority of the state's delegation, even though all Georgiadelegates are obliged to vote for Bush.   On the other side were party regulars, who were outraged at asettlement imposed on them by the national committees and approvedby the national campaigns of Bush and Robertson.   Georgia GOP Chairman John Stuckey, who was on the losing side,left for home Wednesday, saying he would not return to claim hisseat as a convention delegate next week and would not rule out thepossibility of resigning his state party post.   Asked if the Bush campaign had leaned on him to accept anagreement, Stuckey replied, ``No, they fell on me.''   Negotiators included Rich Bond, deputy manager of the Bushcampaign, and Mark Nuttle, who had been manager of the Robertsoncampaign.   ``We are striving to get our family together on this and aim ourfire at Michael Dukakis and not at each other,'' Bond said.   However, Stuckey said he doubted the settlement would achieveparty harmony in Georgia.   ``If the object of this exercise is to buy peace, it will havethe same effect as Mr. (Neville) Chamberlain ... to buy peace,''said Stuckey, referring to the former British prime minister'sattempt to negotiate peace with Nazi Germany before World War II.</TEXT></DOC>
