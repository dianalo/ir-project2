RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today gave federalregulators broad power to oust bank executives from their jobstemporarily when the executives are accused of serious crimes.   In a 9-0 ruling, the court said the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp. acted properly in suspending an Iowa bank president.   The justices upheld a law permitting the FDIC to suspend a bankexecutive accused of serious wrongdoing for up to 90 days while theagency decides the executive's appeal for reinstatement.   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said a bankexecutive's ``interest in continued employment is without doubt animportant interest that ought not be interrupted withoutsubstantial justification.''   But Stevens said, a suspended officer also ``has an interest inseeing that a decision concerning his or her continued suspensionis not made with excessive haste.''   The case stems from the indictment in 1986 of James E. Mallen,president of the now defunct Farmers State Bank of Kanawha, Iowa,on charges he made false statements to the FDIC.   Mallen was accused of concealing financial interests in otherbusinesses and of concealing loans his banks made. His smallagricultural bank in a town of 750 people had assets of $18 million.   He was convicted in federal court last year and sentenced tothree years in prison and fined $10,000. He was ordered to spendonly 60 days in jail and the rest of the sentence was suspended.   Prior to his criminal trial, the FDIC barred him from continuingas bank president and director, prohibited him from taking part inrunning the bank and said he could not vote his stock in the bank'sholding company.   The FDIC acted under a law empowering federal banking regulatorsto suspend executives charged with crimes involving dishonesty orbreach of trust that are punishable by imprisonment for more thanone year.   The law gives the executive a right to appeal to the regulatoryagency. But the statute allows the agency to take up to threemonths to resolve the appeal.   Moreover, the law does not guarantee the banker a chance topresent oral arguments in making the appeal.   A federal judge ruled Mallen's rights were violated by thesuspension and by the ban on oral testimony to the FDIC.   The Reagan administration, on behalf of the FDIC, appealed theruling to the Supreme Court.   The case is FDIC vs. Mallen, 87-82.</TEXT></DOC>
