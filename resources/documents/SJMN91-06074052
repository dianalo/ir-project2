Theproblem is getting enough neighbors to put money into the legal costs.&quot;;   Daniel Cooper, a Ben Lomond attorney representing the Beckers and many of theother homeowners, said the next step -- if his clients decide to take it --would be to appeal the decision in court.;    Santa Cruz County officialsissued an abatement order in 1982 for 28 houses after geologists said a nearbymountainside was in danger of collapse. Since that time eight of the houseshave been destroyed, dismantled, moved or damaged beyond repair.;    The SantaCruz County Building Appeals Board overturned the original abatement orderlast January. County Supervisor Fred Keeley appealed that decision, bringingit before the board of supervisors. The supervisors voted unanimously Tuesdayevening to abate the homes.;    &quot;Revisiting this issue raises pain for thepeople affected,&quot; said Supervisor Robley Levy. &quot;But this is a public safetyissue and our responsibility is to protect the people in Santa Cruz County.&quot;;   The potential landslide area was adjacent to an 800-foot-tall ridge thatcollapsed after a torrential storm dropped 19 inches of rain on the SanLorenzo Valley in 24 hours. The landslide buried nine homes and killed 10people. Dr. Gerald Weber, a geologic adviser to the Santa Cruz County PlanningDepartment, said it took less than 90 seconds for the landslide to occur, andbelieves the other slope could fail just as quickly.;    &quot;It's a textbooklandslide in many respects,&quot; said Weber. &quot;We have very strong evidence --hell, it moved.&quot;;    Weber said he has detected three episodes of movement inthe last nine years. &quot;The more it moves, the more it weathers, and the weakerit becomes,&quot; he said. &quot;When it moves it has the potential to completelyobliterate the area below it.&quot;;    Several homeowners, noting that thepotential for landslides exists in many areas throughout the county, said theywere willing to assume that risk, and offered to sign waivers freeing thecounty from responsibility.;    County Counsel Dwight Herr said such waiverswould not protect the county from lawsuits if visitors to the Love Creek areahomes were killed or injured in another landslide.;    &quot;I don't know why wewere singled out for abatement when the whole (San Lorenzo Valley) area is indanger of landslides,&quot; said Florrine Becker. &quot;We think it's all unfair.&quot;;   Other homeowners said the fact that the hillside above their homes did notcollapse proves that the danger has passed.;    &quot;When a man can't tell me whyit didn't come down, he can't tell me when it will come down,&quot; said homeownerJohn Pizzut. &quot;I think the danger has already taken place.&quot;;    Unlikecondemnation proceedings, where residents are compensated for being forced outof their homes, the owners of the homes in the Love Creek area were placed inthe position of retaining ownership of homes they could not legally live in.;   Twenty-two residents filed a lawsuit against the county in 1982 for failingto warn them about the landslide danger. After paying legal fees, residentsreceived $7,000 to $8,000 each when that case was settled out of court in 1987.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  TERRI MORGAN, Special to the Mercury News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Santa Cruz/Monterey  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910314  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  611  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday March 14, 199100074052,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
