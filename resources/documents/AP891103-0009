The Navy called a news conference Thursday in Portland toreiterate its position that cruise missile testing is safe, butspokesmen denied they were campaigning against the Maine ballotproposal.   While passage would not bind the Navy to stop tests, a ``yes''vote could have an impact on the nuclear arms race, says theCoalition for the Cruise Missile Referendum.   Supporters also say passage would help prompt political actionto halt the missiles.   Gerald Miller, technical director of the Navy's cruise missileproject, said Thursday that all the tests have been conductedwithout injury. He acknowledged that if the Maine question passes,similar movements could crop up in southern and western stateswhere the cruise missiles are flown.   Maine is one of five states where dummy Tomahawk missiles areflown in Navy test missions. In the Maine tests, the missiles arelaunched from submarines off the coast and fly to the western partof the state.   The coalition's Eric Johnson said the tests advance a systemthat is unnecessary because the United States already has a nucleararsenal that could wipe out its adversaries many times over.   Johnson also calls the $11 billion weapon a waste of taxpayers'money and says its development seriously impedes nucleararms-reduction initiatives.   The Navy's Robert Holsapple, noting that 75 percent of theappropriations for the program already have been made, stressedlast week that 3,300 of the 4,030 missiles envisioned in theprogram will carry conventional arms.   He defends Tomahawks as a balance against the relatively strongconventional forces of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact nations.Deploying cruise missiles on 200 surface ships and submarines alsowould complicate Soviet targeting, he said.   The Maine Nuclear Referendum Committee is working against voterratification of a waste-disposal contract that would allow Maine todump low-level waste at a Nevada site for three years. They say itwould do nothing to establish a permanent site to help Maine complywith federal requirements that it take responsibility for its ownlow-level waste, he said.   Gov. John R. McKernan is urging passage of what he says is anecessary contingency in the event the South Carolina dump nowaccepting Maine's waste decides to close its doors to the state.   Passage also would give generators _ principally the MaineYankee atomic plant, which produces 83 percent of the state's wasteby volume _ more time to build long-term storage sites, accordingto advocates of passage.</TEXT></DOC>
