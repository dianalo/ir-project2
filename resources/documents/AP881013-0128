(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican U.S. Senate candidate Jim Dunnhas filed suit against his own party, saying a national GOPcommittee crippled his campaign by breaking a promise to contribute$638,000.   The former congressman said he filed the lawsuit in U.S.District Court in Lansing on Wednesday as a last resort to get themoney in time to pay for television ads before the Nov. 8 election.   The Democratic incumbent, Sen. Donald Riegle, holds a 2-1 leadover Dunn in the latest polls.   Dunn's lawsuit names as defendants the Republican NationalCommittee and one of its arms, the National Republican SenatorialCommittee. It seeks an emergency injunction ordering the senatorialcommittee to come up with about $438,000 for his campaign.   Dunn, an East Lansing home builder, said he had received$200,000 from the committee, but had been told he wouldn't get therest, even though his financially strapped campaign couldn't affordtelevision ads without it.   Dunn has spent $250,000 of his own money on his campaign andsaid the promise of $638,000 from the senatorial committee was oneof the reasons he decided to enter the race.   He said he didn't know why the senatorial committee had renegedon its promise. ``They won't return my phone calls,'' he said.   Tom Mason, a spokesman for the senatorial committee inWashington, said it would have no direct comment on the lawsuit orthe commitment to Dunn.   ``We don't like to fight in public with any of our guys. Wethink it doesn't help anybody ... on the other hand, we don'tcriticize them for anything they do if they think it will helptheir campaign,'' Mason said.</TEXT></DOC>
