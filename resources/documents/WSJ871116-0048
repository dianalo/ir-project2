The utility said it asked the Michigan Public Service Commission for permission to cut between 16% and 35% the rates charged &quot;certain large industrial and commercial&quot; customers by 1989. At the same time, residential rates would increase 2.9%.    CMS, which sells both electricity and natural gas, said the net effect would be &quot;essentially no increase in total gas revenues.&quot; The company, however, said the change would improve its &quot;ability to compete with alternate sources of energy&quot; available to industrial and commercial buyers. The typical residential customer's bill would increase $2.50 &quot;during a cold winter's month,&quot; CMS said. </TEXT></DOC>
