<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-69-0611 </DOCNO><TEXT>Major issues raised by the proposed policy are: determination of marketingarea, allocation of power among customers within the marketing area,extent and condition of sales to TVA, utilization of area utility systemsfor power integration, firming, wheeling, and other essential relationships,wholesale rates, handling of resale rates, and conservation measures.This Marketing Policy will continue present practices in many areas,and to the extent that this is done, the existing environmental impactswill continue. SEPA has informally consulted with other agencies, publicbodies, and individuals which may be affected by the proposed policyto look for activities resulting from the proposed action which couldaffect the environment on a local or regional basis. In this review,SEPA has not uncovered any unresolved conflicts as a result of the implementationof the proposed policy. SEPA has found that the nature and extent ofthe environmental consequences resulting from the policy are too remoteand speculative to link directly to any air, land, or water quality impacts.No extraordinary, controversial, unique, or hazardous circumstances orconditions will be created or furthered by this policy.</TEXT></DOC>
