The Commission is chaired by Richard Schubert, President ofthe American Red Cross and a former Under Secretary of Labor. The Commissionhas 21 members representing experts and senior executives from business,labor, government, academia, and the public. The findings of the Commissionwill be issued as a report to the Secretary on Labor Day of 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">Agenda Topics/Issues </ITAG>These hearings will focus on two aspects of the labor market: workforcequality and labor market efficiency. The issues being considered by theCommission have been stated below in the form of questions. The first setof questions address mechanisms for increasing the skill level of workers(workforce quality). The second set of questions address methods for makingbetter use of the skills that already exist in the workforce (labor marketefficiency). These questions are intended to facilitate the presentationof views on the options that should be considered by the Commission. Members of the public should be aware that these questions by no meansinclude all possible avenues of inquiry of interest to the Commission.However, they should prove helpful to potential participants in preparingwritten or oral comments. In addition, the questions are intended to assistin focusing the information provided to the Commission through the hearings.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Workforce Quality </ITAG>A. Incentives for Student Achievement There is reason to believe that some of the deficiencies of secondary schoolstudents could be addressed by creating incentives for students to stayin school longer and to work harder in school. The idea is to convincethe students that their hard work and perseverance will be rewarded. i. What incentives can be given to students to attend class regularly andreceive good grades? ii. Would it help if teachers were consistently asked by employers to writeletters of recommendation on behalf of students? iii. Would students perform better if employers asked them for their highschool transcripts? iv. Is it possible for employers to work with the schools to guaranteegood jobs to good students upon graduation? v. Is there an increasing need to facilitate information flows betweenemployers and educational institutions? What kind of information shouldbe the primary focus of these information flows? What role should governmentand the private sector play in facilitating this communication? B. ``Second Chance'' Education and Training Systems Government-provided programs can be used to provide education and trainingto individuals who are high school dropouts and those who have completedhigh school but do not plan to pursue post-secondary education. Many suggestthat the proper focus of these programs is on basic language, mathematics,and job-readiness skills because job-specific skill training will be amplysupplied by private employers to those individuals who possess basic skills.Others argue that specific skill training is an essential element of governmenttraining programs because it provides a much needed applied dimension tobasic skills instruction. i. What is the appropriate focus of government training programs? ii. Should universal free basic education for adults be a priority goalof employment and training policy? iii. Should a tighter integration of federally-supported job training andplacement services occur (e.g., JTPA, Employment Service, and VocationalEducation) and at what level(s) of government? What are the impedimentsto integration? iv. Is there an increasing need to facilitate information flows betweenemployers and training institutions? What kind of information should bethe primary focus of these information flows? C. Lifetime Training and Retraining Many people believe that the rate of structural change in the economy isincreasing because of technological advances and increasing foreign competition.If this is true, it will become increasingly important that all workersreceive training throughout their lifetimes so that they will be betterable to adjust to these changes. i. What is the appropriate mix between the public and private sectors forproviding training and retraining to workers? ii. Are public policies needed to encourage more training within the privatesector? iii. What is the most effective approach to encouraging private investmentin training? iv. Should policies to encourage private-sector training be focused onparticular groups of workers? If so, what should the focus be? D. Financing and Tax Treatment of Education and Training Private capital markets represent the primary source of financing for humancapital investment. Government programs designed to facilitate access tothese markets (e.g., guaranteed student loans) have encountered repaymentand other administrative problems. Moreover, some observers, who questionwhether loans provide sufficient access to capital markets for minoritiesand the disadvantaged, believe that grants should be made more widely available.Finally, the role of corporate and personal income taxes in creating incentivesfor human capital investment must be considered. i. How would private loan sources respond to changes in the availabilityof government loans? ii. What alternative loan schemes are practical and what role should bedelineated for government in each? What are the trade-offs associated witheach loan scheme? iii. What groups should be targeted for assistance in accessing financialcapital markets? Should there be universal access to loans for post-secondaryeducation? iv. Should the corporate and personal income tax structures be changedto encourage investment in human capital? If so, how should they be changed?<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Labor Market Efficiency </ITAG>A. Matching Workers and Jobs Efficient use of the human capital that is embodied in our labor forcerequires that we have mechanisms for quickly matching the skills of unemployedworkers with the skills that are demanded by employers. The Omnibus Tradeand Competitiveness Act of 1988 and the Worker Adjustment and RetrainingNotification Act are intended to facilitate this process for dislocatedworkers. In addition, all job seekers can use a variety of other mechanismsand institutions ranging from private labor market intermediaries to government-fundedagencies such as the Employment Service. i. Could a relocation bonus, provided through the unemployment insurancesystem, create a sufficient incentive for dislocated workers to relocate?Are additional incentives needed? ii. What policy changes are needed to encourage a larger role for laborand management in facilitating the process of adjustment for dislocatedworkers? iii. What is the appropriate mix of services for the Employment Service?iv. Should vouchers be given to job seekers, thereby allowing them to choosebetween public and private agencies that provide labor market information?v. Are changes needed in the way the Employment Service is financed? vi. Are policy changes needed to facilitate flexibility on the part ofstates and localities in organizing Employment Service functions and otheremployment and training services?B. Enhancing Labor Force Participation Through Flexibility The demographic composition of the labor force is changing rapidly. Witheach passing year, a greater percentage of the workforce will consist ofwomen and minorities. At the same time, the workforce is aging. These changeswill require increased workplace flexibility if firms are to attract andretain productive workers. This flexibility may require employers to becomeincreasingly involved in assisting workers with their dependent care responsibilities,providing increased flexibility in working hours, and offering more flexibleemployee benefit options. It will also require human resource policiesthat facilitate the labor force participation of segments of the populationwho have experienced difficulties in the labor market. i. What should be the respective roles of government and employers in assistingworkers to meet the cost of dependent (child and elder) care? Should eligibilityfor government assistance in meeting the cost of dependent care extendto those engaged in non-market work (e.g., school or full-time trainingor work in the home)? ii. Does employer-sponsored dependent care have a positive effect on workerproductivity and the profitability of the firm? iii. What are the impediments to increasing worker flexibility in managingwork time? Which of these impediments result from public policy? iv. What should government do to encourage private sector human resourcepolicies that facilitate labor force entry and advancement in employmentamong groups that have experienced labor market problems, e.g., black youth(expecially males), women who are household heads, displaced homemakers,persons with disabilities, and older workers? How can the private sectorreach out to these groups?v. Should increased pension portability be a public policy priority? Whatshould be the major elements of pension policy with respect to portability?vi. Are changes needed in retirement policies to facilitate the labor forceparticipation of older workers? C. Industrial Relations and ProductivityIn the 1970's and through the 1980's the American industrial relationssystem turned increasingly to efforts to enhance worker performance andproductivity. These programs have included: more labor involvement in plantmanagement, quality circles, job redesign, employee stock ownership arrangements,labor-management cooperation focused on a broad range of employment issues,other types of employee participation, and pay-for-knowledge plans.i. What is the impact of employee participation and involvement programsand innovative pay schemes on worker morale and productivity? ii. What is the appropriate focus of public policy in this area: disseminationof ``best practice'' information, or incentives to encourage worker participationand involvement in both union and non-union firms? iii. Does the current tax treatment of employee ownership plans providethe proper economic incentives?<ITAG tagnum="84">Hearings Objectives and Procedures </ITAG>The Commission seeks participation in the hearings from a wide spectrumof individuals and organizations.
