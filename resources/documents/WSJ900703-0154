One Treasury official privately predicts that thedepartment will recommend rolling back the official insuranceceiling from $100,000 to perhaps $50,000. Says anotheradministration aide: &quot;We have to find a way to limit thecosts to the taxpayer.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   In a switch from the past, Congress, chastened by the costof the savings-and-loan disaster, is receptive to some typeof deposit-insurance revision, though not necessarily alongthe lines Treasury plans to propose by year end. &quot;Nobodywants to even remotely believe we would have to face thisagain,&quot; says Sen. Alan Dixon, an Illinois Democrat who sitson the Senate Banking Committee.   Overhauling the system of &quot;insuring,&quot; or guaranteeing,deposits could be the most important aftershock of the $150billion savings-and-loan bailout. It would be likely toreshape U.S. financial institutions, most notably by causingsome big depositors to lose money and endangering many of thecountry's 12,000 small banks and thrifts. But some say majorreforms are the last, best hope to prevent another Sandamp;L-typeblowout.   &quot;I don't think the problems in the Sandamp;Ls are attributableto anything other than deposit insurance,&quot; says PeterWallison, a banking lawyer who served as the top attorney atthe Treasury and the White House during the Reagan years.Although that ignores the widespread fraud and the Reaganadministration's policy of deregulation without adequatesupervision, it's true that the problem would have been farsmaller without insurance on big deposits. And many agreewith Mr. Wallison's conclusion that &quot;if we don't fix thesystem, it will fail again in the banking industry.&quot;   Yet even tinkering with deposit insurance remainspolitically explosive, and reforming it is far from a surething.   The issue splits the banking industry bitterly. Two of thethree most important banking trade groups favor exposingcorporate or wealthy individual depositors to a loss in bankfailures. But the third, representing small banks, isdead-set against it. Small banks fear that they will losemany depositors and be crippled if deposit insurance isslashed, so they are proposing instead that the governmentopenly insure all deposits, no matter how large. Inpreparation for the looming confrontation, rival bankinglobbyists already are working Capitol Hill door-to-door.   &quot;The battle for the soul of the Treasury is on,&quot; saysKenneth Guenther, who runs the small-bank group, theIndependent Bankers Association of America.   The Treasury Department is contemplating turning around atrain that has been roaring in the same direction since 1934.Congress responded to the failure in the early 1930s of morethan a third of the nation's 25,000 banks by protecting$2,500 per account. Partly to adjust for inflation, Congressgradually jacked up that amount, with the biggest increase,from $40,000 to $100,000, in 1980. The program now coverseveryone from children to savvy investors who scour thenation for the highest rates on &quot;jumbo&quot; deposits.   In the 1980s, $100,000 deposits flew like needles to amagnet to get the highest yields, and thus many of them endedup in the riskiest, most fraudulent Sandamp;Ls in the country.Thrift executives drew giant salaries from thetaxpayer-backed deposits. Then they rolled the dice andinvested the rest in thousands upon thousands of crazyreal-estate projects, junk bonds, luxury-car dealerships andexpensive artwork. If the investments paid off, they mademore money. But the dice often came up snake eyes. And nowall the losing propositions are in the hands of those whoreally paid for it -- the taxpayers.   By attracting deposits with above-market rates and agovernment guarantee backing them up, &quot;Thrifts wereessentially printing money through deposit insurance,&quot; saysWilliam Seidman, chairman of both the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. and the new agency running the Sandamp;L cleanup,the Resolution Trust Corp. Richard Breeden, a key architectof the cleanup and now chairman of the Securities andExchange Commission, agrees: &quot;The institutions that grew2,000% or 3,000% weren't getting those funds becauseinvestors thought they were well-run businesses. Depositinsurance made those funds available.&quot;   Yet there's more to the Alice-in-Wonderland quality ofdeposit insurance. Most important, the $100,000 insuranceceiling is really an apparition. Since the then-ailingContinental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co. was rescued in1984 on the theory that its collapse might severely damagethe financial system and perhaps the whole economy, thegovernment -- under a policy dubbed &quot;too-big-to-fail&quot; -- hascovered almost all deposits by arranging sales of brokebanks. And, out of fairness to smaller banks, &quot;too big tofail&quot; has been extended to protect virtually all depositorsfrom losing money. (In most cases, the only depositors cutoff at $100,000 are those in small banks that the governmentcan't sell and liquidates instead.)   The upshot: Deposit insurance is like an auto-insurancefund where 16-year-old drunks and Sunday drivers pay the samepremium and everybody gets fully paid off in an accident.Some are asking why anyone other than accident-prone peopleshould favor that.                                                                                                          Treasury's Tradeoff                                                                                                          Treasury officials don't. So they are preparing a packagethat would rework deposit insurance and expand the businessesthat banks can enter. Treasury is also considering a call forfurther dropping the barriers to interstate banking, aimingto give the banking system more stability by spreading risk.Although the outcome of their deliberations could beinfluenced by political pressure, their basic thinking seemsset. &quot;An industry that can't make profits is doomed tooperate in an unsafe and unsound condition,&quot; reasons a topofficial overseeing the study.   He and other Treasury officials worry that big U.S. bankscould become shaky if they fall behind in competition withforeign banks, many of which enjoy broad powers not permittedU.S. banks, such as selling insurance, underwritingsecurities and forging close links with commercialbusinesses. &quot;Diversifying the activities of banks candecrease risk,&quot; he says.   Many banking experts agree, but the trouble is that thissmacks of financial deregulation, which rattles Congressthese days. Anticipating such fears, Treasury will probablypropose stringent rules to ensure that the deposit-insurancesafety net isn't stretched to include the new businessactivities. So-called firewalls, for example, would preventinsured money from being used in the areas to be opened tobanks.   In sum, Treasury is likely to propose to Congress a quidpro quo: Prevent a future bailout by giving big banks broaderpowers while cutting deposit insurance.   Conspicuously absent from that equation are small banks --possibly the fatal flaw in the Treasury's approach. Big bankswield huge financial clout, but small banks, with offices inevery congressional district, carry more political weight onCapitol Hill. To thousands of small banks and thrifts acrossthe country, the Treasury proposal will look like a tradeoffwithout a payoff. They are uninterested in getting newpowers. And they fear that a cutback in deposit insurancewould send their depositors running to big banks viewed as&quot;too big to fail&quot; and thus 100%-insured, no matter what thegovernment says.                                                                                                          A `Haircut' for Depositors                                                                                                          So the banking industry has cooked up a compromise: Imposea little &quot;depositor discipline.&quot; The American BankersAssociation, which represents both big and small banks,proposes shaving off a percentage -- say, 10% -- onreimbursements beyond the first $100,000, which would befully covered. A person with $200,000 in a failed bank, forexample, would recover $190,000. The size of the haircutwould increase as bank failures increased.   The haircut idea appeals to a Congress fearful ofantagonizing politically potent bankers but eager to limitthe government's liability. &quot;I feel too many people have beenmade whole,&quot; says Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the rankingRepublican on the Banking Committee.   The sticking point here is that small bankers simply don'tbelieve that regulators would force depositors in a big bankto actually take a loss. They want Congress to make the&quot;haircut&quot; mandatory. &quot;That is kind of a linchpin,&quot; saysWilliam Brandon, president of a small bank in Helena, Ark.,and a member of the ABA committee on deposit insurance.   Small banks are right to be skeptical. Because of thedamage a big-bank failure might do, says Federal ReserveBoard Governor John LaWare, &quot;I don't know how you canaltogether get rid of `too-big-to-fail.'&quot;                                                                                                          Insuring Everything                                                                                                          If you liked the Sandamp;L mess, you'll love the small banks'response to it. They want the government to insureeverything.   Actually, the idea isn't as crazy as it may seem. All itwould do is formally extend the too-big-to-fail doctrine toall banks and thrifts. The Independent Bankers Association ofAmerica, the small-bank group, is canvassing Capitol Hill forfull coverage, and although legislators aren't exactly liningup to support the idea, some are sympathetic. &quot;I think theradical tinkering should be on the regulatory side,&quot; saysRep. Jim Leach, an Iowa Republican. &quot;Modest tinkering shouldbe considered for deposit insurance.&quot;   If Uncle Sam is on the hook for every dollar on deposit,how can he prevent another bailout? Big banks fear that under100% insurance, the public will start treating banks likeutilities. And, in fact, those who propose covering alldepositors suggest a slew of accompanying regulations.   Most important of such regulatory moves, the Fed's Mr.LaWare says, &quot;is effective supervision and effectivecapitalization. That's better than cleaning up the mess afterthe bank has failed.&quot;   Mr. LaWare and other regulators argue that as long asbanks maintain adequate capital -- the bank owners'investment, which in a crisis is drained off before federaldeposit insurance is tapped -- major revisions in theinsurance may be unnecessary. The Sandamp;Ls, they assert, wouldn'thave risked those wild investments if the government hadn'tlet them operate with little or no capital. Without muchinvestment at risk, thrift owners had every incentive togamble for high stakes. The regulators add that althoughdepositors now are being paid off in full, shareholders andbondholders lose their investment, and they demand prudencefrom bank managers.   But critics of that view say regulations can be peeledback. If the thrift mess teaches us anything, they argue, itis that bank and thrift owners will always press thegovernment to ease up, imperiling the deposit-insurance fund.&quot;The worst ones will squawk the most,&quot; contends Bert Ely, afinancial consultant. &quot;That's the way the political processworks.&quot; In fact, even as the thrift bailout metastasized inrecent months, banks burdened with real-estate problems askedregulators for forbearance on capital requirements, tostretch out the period in which the banks have to recognizereal-estate losses. So far, regulators have rebuffed thoserequests.   Wary of the entire deposit-insurance thicket, some inCongress are looking for ways to tiptoe around it. Limitingdepositors to one insured account apiece is a popular idea onthe Hill, but no one has yet come up with a workable way todo that.   Another idea is to link the premiums banks pay to theriskiness of their assets. If a bank's managers took unusualrisks, the thinking goes, premiums would rise to the pointwhere its stock price and dividend would fall, andshareholders would apply pressure to lower the risk.   But some question whether insurers can properly judge therisk in a bank's portfolio. A decade ago, for example, manyexperts were positive that the oil boom had nowhere to go butup; but, of course, oil prices collapsed, taking down a lotof Texas banks.   Even so, the idea is probably the least controversialfloating around Congress. Hoping to prod the Treasury tothink seriously about risk-based premiums, Sen. Dixon soonwill introduce a plan to require the FDIC to go to a privateinsurer to back up a small slice of its liabilities. Theprivate insurer, with its own money at risk and presumablyimmune to pressure from Congress, would look over the FDIC'sshoulder in setting premiums.   The wild card in the deposit-insurance debate is thepublic, which really hasn't been heard from yet. Congresscould quickly lose its fervor for reform if depositors howledabout reduced coverage.   &quot;As depositors, the public has been treated handsomely,&quot;says Carter Golembe, chairman of the Secura Group, a bankconsulting firm. &quot;The government made a promise todepositors, and it kept the promise. The question is: Is thepublic more angry as taxpayers than it is happy asdepositors?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
