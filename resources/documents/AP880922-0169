The ``Competitive Strategies Initiative'' would involve usingconventional weaponry ``in new ways,'' put heavy emphasis on navalforces and use high technology to deploy and mobilize conventionalforces in Europe, aides said.   Democratic rival Michael Dukakis has made beefed-up conventionalforces a cornerstone of his campaign.   Aides said Bush's comments, at a $3.1 million Texas fund-raiserin which he shared the stage with President Reagan, could pave theway _ under certain circumstances _ for U.S. troop reductions inEurope in the future, although Bush did not automatically favorsuch a reduction.   And one senior campaign adviser, speaking only on the conditionof anonymity, said that elements of Bush's so-called ``CompetitiveStrategies Initiative'' would be embraced by the outgoing Reaganadministration and announced within the next few days by DefenseSecretary Frank Carlucci.   ``It marks a change in the way we utilize forces, usingconventional weaponry in new ways,'' the official said.   Meanwhile, Reagan, here to help Bush's presidential candidacyand to raise money for the party, said Democrats ``use our wordsand borrow our tune but the song is way out of key.''   Reagan said prevailing Democratic Party views on nationaldefense would make two prominent late Texans _ President LyndonJohnson and House Speaker Sam Rayburn _ ``shake their heads inwonder and confusion.''   Serving as a warmup speaker for Bush, Reagan accused Dukakis offlip-flopping on such questions as support for the B-1 bomber.   Without mentioning Dukakis' name, Reagan told 2,500 GOP faithfulthat ``we believe in a national defense that defends our shores andour allies by land, air and sea _ and very soon, space, through theStrategic Defense Initiative.''   ``But the opposition wants to reduce the size of our Navy, rightat a critical moment when the Soviets are building up their navalpresence in the Pacific,'' he said.   Reagan, in particular, reiterated his call for a 600-ship Navy.Bush aides said the candidate's new defense proposal, likewise,would put heavy emphasis on naval forces.   Bush, here after a brief foray into Dukakis' backyard to collectthe endorsement of a Boston police union, discussed his defenseproposals without getting into specifics.   He said in prepared remarks his Competitive StrategiesInitiative would be ``based on the idea of putting our strengthsagainst our competitor's weaknesses.''   He said the initiative had been under study for two years in the``Reagan-Bush Defense Department.'' He said he would make theprogram, and working on it with U.S. allies, ``a high priority inmy administration.''   The plan is based on ``existing weapons systems and those wehave in the pipeline now,'' Bush said.   ``It is designed to ensure that we need not match the Sovietsbullet for bullet and tank for tank,'' Bush said.   In general, the proposal involves using high technology systemsfor mobilizing and deploying forces, principally for the defense ofEurope in the wake of the new U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminateintermediate-range nuclear missiles, aides said.   Asked if Bush's remarks could suggest a movement toward reducingthe number of U.S. troops in Europe, Bush spokeswoman Alixe Glensaid, ``it could. It could mean there would be less emphasis onthat.''   However, she said that the initiative did not automatically meanthat Bush favored such a reduction.   And Dennis Ross, Bush's foreign-policy adviser, said that theproposal ``is simply a new management process for spending ourmoney smarter in new weapons systems of the future.''   Bush said he would detail the proposal in the weeks ahead.   In the speech here and in an earlier address to Republicanactivists and college students on the campus of Baylor Universityin Waco, Texas, Reagan accused the Democrats of moderating theirviews on national security issues in response to public opinionpolls.   Reagan said Dukakis and Democratic running mate Lloyd Bentsen ofTexas had adopted his and Bush's issues.   ``You'll hear them say there are no disagreements between themand us about these bedrock principles,'' Reagan said. ``But it justdoesn't sound right. They use our words and borrow our tune, butthe song is way out of key.''   The joint appearance by Reagan and Bush was their second sinceBush was nominated as the Republican presidential candidate in NewOrleans last Aug. 17. The pair appeared together at a rally in LosAngeles a week later.   During the Waco speech earlier, Reagan seemed to be poking funat the attempt in recent weeks by the Dukakis campaign to burnishthe Massachusetts governor's defense credentials, particularly thedecision to have Dukakis don a helmet and pose in a military tank.   ``Lately, some liberal leaders have seen what was happening tothem in the polls and had a death-bed conversion,'' he told some9,000 cheering students and others in the Baylor Universityathletic center. ``They'd have you believe that they're born-againGeorge Pattons. But if we go the way they want to go, our defenseswill run out of gas in no time.''   Gen. George Patton was a renowned World War II combat hero.</TEXT></DOC>
