The toddler remained hospitalized in stable condition today,said Sgt. George Anthony, a police spokesman. He said no details onthe girl's identity and injuries would be released.

Police said the girl apparently was carried from a playgroundand sexually assaulted Sunday in a vacant house, one of many in theWest Side neighborhood.   ``We've been calling about these ... houses,'' said residentEllen Goddard, complaining about a lack of response by cityofficials. ``They told us a lie that they would get them down inthree months.   ``It made me feel so bad I wanted to hurt somebody.''   Dale Lee, 30, and Bobby Anderson, 37, found the girl in thetrash bin Sunday afternoon as they returned from a store.   ``We heard something howling. We thought it was a cat,'' saidLee. ``When we got closer we thought it was a baby. I saw theDumpster shaking up and down and I looked in it and there she wasjumping up and down.''</TEXT></DOC>
