The president spoke before a hastily assembled crowd at aceremony at the Iwo Jima Memorial, the statue of five Marinesraising the flag on a Pacific island during World War II.   Bush used the ceremony to register his support for aRepublican-drafted proposed amendment that asserts: ``The Congressand the states shall have power to prohibit the physical desecrationof the flag of the United States.''   ``This flag is one of our most powerful ideas,'' Bush declared.``If it is not defended, it is defamed...it represents the fabric ofour nation.''   Bush said the statue behind him, a huge bronze casting of aphotograph by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal, was``stunning...even now it humbles us, inspires us.''   Bush said that the amendment drafted by Republican congressionalleaders with the support of some Democrats was ``simple, stark andto-the-point.''   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas praised Bush forsupporting the amendment and called it ``a serious step'' tocircumvent last week's 5-4 Supreme Court ruling that said flagburning is a form of free expression protected by the Constitution.   Dole said that people across the nation were speaking out againstthe ruling. ``People are saying, keep your hands off Old Glory,'' hesaid.   Also speaking at the ceremony were co-sponsors of the amendment,House Republican leader Robert Michel of Illinois and two Democrats,Sen. Alan Dixon of Illinois and Rep. Sonny Montgomery of Mississippi.   Both Democrats and Republicans have publicly deplored the SupremeCourt decision, but a spokesman for the Democratic NationalCommittee accused Bush of using the issue for political opportunism.   ``He's running for president instead of being president,'' MikeMcCurry, DNC communications director, said Wednesday. ``The heroesof Iwo Jima didn't die so they could become a backdrop for somepolitical photo opportunity.''   Bush used the flag ceaselessly in his presidential campaign lastyear. He visited a flag factory and attacked Democrat MichaelDukakis, the Massachusetts governor, for vetoing as unconstitutionala bill requiring the Pledge of Allegiance to be recited in schools.   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., introduced theresolution Thursday before the House adjourned for its holidayrecess.   Michel said he expects Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole ofKansas to introduce it there when that chamber returns from itsextended Fourth of July holiday, which began last week.   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Thursday the HouseJudiciary Committee will begin hearings on the flag issue in July.   Foley, while condemning flag burning, has urged caution aboutamending the Constitution. Michel said he generally agrees, butbelieves such action is the only answer in this case.   ``I just have to assume we're not going to be thwarted,'' hesaid, insisting he did not view the issue as a Republican attempt topaint the Democrats as less patriotic.   Democratic Rep. Sonny Montgomery of Mississippi joined Michel inintroducing the resolution.   Michel said the amendment avoids specific methods of desecrationbecause any list might leave one out. He pointed out, however, thatthe amendment referred only to physical desecration in order toavoid hampering free expression.</TEXT></DOC>
