At most, the results suggest it probably evolved from its WestAfrican cousin within the last 100 years, said researcher TempleSmith.   AIDS viruses are found in humans and monkeys, but the studycould not determine whether an ancestral virus jumped from monkeysto humans, or vice versa, said Smith, director of the MolecularBiology Computer Research Resource at the Dana-Farber CancerInstitute of Harvard Medical School.   The work follows a study published last week that suggested anancestral AIDS virus infected the primitive ancestors of humans andmonkeys more than 20 million years ago. Smith said he doubts thatconclusion.   The new work, which used a different method of analysis, appearsin the British journal Nature. Smith wrote it with colleagues atthe U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and the Los AlamosNational Laboratory in New Mexico.   It concerns the AIDS virus, called HIV-1, a West Africanrelative called HIV-2, and a monkey AIDS virus called SIV.   Researchers focused on genes, which act as inherited blueprints,for proteins from the coating of the viruses. They compared genesfrom a total of seven samples of HIV-1 and HIV-2, plus two samplesof SIV.   After defining similarities and differences that resulted fromthe evolutionary history of each virus sample, they constructed afamily tree that would account for the similarities and differencesthey found.   To measure how fast HIV-1 was evolving, they compared a 1976sample to others found during the 1980s.   Results suggest that HIV-1 and HIV-2 split into separateevolutionary paths at least 40 years ago, Smith said in a telephoneinterview. And ``unless there is something very unusual going on,''he said, the split must have occurred no more than 80 to 100 yearsago.   Russell Doolittle, biology professor at the University ofCalifornia, San Diego, said the estimate made sense to him.   Other researchers also have concluded the split in the humanvirus occurred relatively recently, said Doolittle, who has studiedthe evolution of the family of viruses that includes the onecausing acquired immune deficiency syndrome.   Smith said the monkey virus also have split from the humanviruses 40 years to 100 years ago. But that assumes that the monkeyvirus has evolved at about the same rate as the human viruses, andno information is available on that, Smith said.   Such a recent branching into human and monkey viruses contrastssharply with last week's study that suggests the split occurredmore than 20 million years ago, when humans and monkeys went theirown ways on the family primate tree.   Smith said he doubted that various samples of the human AIDSvirus found so far would resemble each other so closely if a humanversion had so much time to evolve into different variants.</TEXT></DOC>
