But don't hold your breath.</LP><TEXT>   Hostage-holding by Iran-inspired terrorist groups was thebiggest single obstacle to a rapprochement between Tehran andWashington. But Iran's recent behavior in several other,less-publicized areas has soured the mood of even thoseadministration policy-makers who would like to see relationsimprove.   In particular, Iran has embarked on an ambitiousrearmament program, analysts say. And, though it seems to beyears away from success, Iran appears to have launched aserious effort to develop nuclear weapons. Moreover, Iran hasviciously criticized the U.S.-led Middle East peace processand openly supported radical terrorist groups hoping todisrupt it.   Of course, it isn't just the U.S. that will have troublewarming up the American-Iranian relationship. Though Iranprobably helped end the hostage problem to improve itschances of building business ties to the West, its rhetorictoward the U.S. remains laced with Khomeini-style rantingsabout the &quot;Great Satan.&quot; The public mood such rhetoriccreates in Iran would make it difficult for President HashemiRafsanjani to move very far toward the U.S., even if he wantsto.   Iran weighs heavily on the minds of U.S. officials becauseits natural riches and strategic position make it the logicalcandidate to emerge as the dominant power in the Persian Gulfregion over the long run. Tehran seems to have decided torebuild its military strength in hopes of playing that roleprecisely at a time when the U.S. is leading an effort toslow down the arms race in the Middle East.   Iran's military strength was sapped by its long,debilitating war with Iraq, and its armed forces emerged fromthe fight weaker than did Iraq's. But the pounding Iraq tookin the Persian Gulf War appears to have convinced Iran thatit has an opportunity to regain military parity with Iraq,U.S. analysts say.   American officials think the Iranians have decided torestock with Soviet-designed equipment. Last year, Iranbought 20 MiG-29 jet fighters from the Soviet Union, and isbelieved to be negotiating to buy more from Moscow or China.The Iranians also appear to be shopping for Soviet T-72tanks, perhaps from East European countries interested inselling their Warsaw Pact equipment for cash.   In addition, Tehran signed a contract this year with Chinato acquire about 40 F-7 fighters, Iranian opposition groupsand U.S. officials say. Iran also has been acquiring missilesfrom China and North Korea, and seems particularly interestedin extending the range of its missiles.   Iran has about 120 Iraqi planes that Iraq sent to Iranianairfields to save from destruction during Operation DesertStorm. But U.S. analysts think Iran has incorporated only ahandful of those planes into its armed forces, and would havetrouble absorbing the rest because it lacks the training andspare parts needed to operate the kinds of planes Iraq uses.It's more likely Iran will use the planes in negotiationswith Iraq about reparations from their war or sell them toraise cash.   Even more troublesome are growing signs that Iran isseeking materials from China, India and Argentina to buildnuclear weapons. Though Iran has signed the internationalnon-proliferation treaty, some of its own Islamic leadershave suggested in recent weeks that their country needs todevelop nuclear weapons to match Israel's arsenal. Iranianopposition officials assert that Iran has covertly openedseveral new nuclear research facilities in recent years.   All this is taking place at a time when Iran is agitatingto disrupt the nascent peace negotiations between Israel andits Arab neighbors. Iran's initial response to the U.S.-ledpeace effort was to invite the Arab world's most virulentopponents of peace with Israel, including the region's mostactive terrorist leaders, to a conference in Tehran in lateOctober. It isn't merely fringe elements of the Iraniangovernment who have been beating the drum; Ayatollah AliKhamenei, Iran's supreme religious leader, declared as thetalks began: &quot;Those who take part in this treason will sufferthe wrath of the nations.&quot;   Most analysts think Iran's railing against the peace talkshas more bluster than bite, and is designed by Mr.Rafsanjani's government principally to placate radicalelements inside Iran. &quot;The rejectionist front meeting inTehran had almost no importance,&quot; asserts William Quandt, ananalyst at the Brookings Institution. Still, the rhetoric hasleft a sour taste in the mouths of U.S. officials, andsuggests that Iran still would like to limit Americaninfluence in its corner of the world.</TEXT></DOC>
