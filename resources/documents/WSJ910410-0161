But SEC officials are sharply divided on whether they havethe legal authority to take action should they find evidenceof insider trading in the junk-bond market, as they found inthe stock market in the 1980s.</LP><TEXT>   Says SEC Commissioner Edward Fleischman: &quot;There's no realbody of law&quot; to bring insider-trading cases in the junk-bondarea.   William McLucas, the SEC's enforcement chief, also seeslegal hurdles in prosecuting suspected junk-bondinsider-trading cases. &quot;Analysis is much more difficult inthe debt area,&quot; he says. &quot;Corporations have fiduciary dutiesto equity holders that aren't owed to debtholders,&quot; making itharder to bring cases.   In recent weeks, the SEC's New York office has soughtdocuments and trading records from a number of well-knownjunk-bond buyers, according to people familiar with theinquiry. They say that the New York office has opened a casefile titled: &quot;Informal Inquiry-Trading in Securities byMembers of Creditors Committees.&quot;   The people say that SEC staffer members suspect that somejunk investors may have traded junk bonds and related stocksbased on information learned from their roles on variouscreditors committees. When a company gets into financialtrouble, its creditors often establish committees to act onbehalf of bondholders in negotiations with management aboutfinancial restructuring.   However, the people say that the SEC's New York officehasn't sought permission from the SEC in Washington to open aformal investigation that would give investigators subpoenapower.   Separately, staff members of the SEC's market regulationand economic analysis departments in Washington have talkedwith officials of a number of large brokerage firms to learnmore about the junk-bond market.   Several SEC commissioners think the agency does have thelegal muscle to bring insider-trading cases involving junkbonds based on theft of confidential corporate information.Commissioner Richard Roberts, for example, is urgingenforcement staffers to bring a case &quot;with the right factsand circumstances.&quot;   The growing concern over insider trading in junk bondscomes soon after the federal government successfullyprosecuted a string of securities-fraud and insider-tradingcases centering on the stock market. Now, however, insidertrading appears to be spilling over into other markets wherelaws guiding such trading may be unclear.   Several times in recent months, prices of certainhigh-yield junk bonds have surged a day or two before bullishcorporate news became public. The junk bonds of HarcourtBrace Jovanovich Inc. and Fort Howard Corp., among others,have seen such price run-ups.   Junk bonds &quot;often seem to trade up significantly prior tothe announcement of deals,&quot; says Dan Harmetz, a junk-bondportfolio manager at Fidelity Investments, the big mutualfund group.   Keeping track of trading is far tougher in junk bonds thanin stocks. There isn't any central junk-bond exchange withposted prices, minute-by-minute, as there is in the stockmarket. Instead, all junk-bond trading is doneover-the-counter by dealers on the telephone. That makes ittough for regulators to monitor trading, as they do in thestock market, for unusual bursts of activity before importantnews.   Reacting to suspicious run-ups in junk-bond prices, Sen.Donald Riegle Jr., chairman of the Senate Banking Committee,asked the SEC in January whether it had the legal authorityto bring insider-trading cases in the junk-bond area. TheMichigan Democrat was prepared to push through federallegislation to give the SEC added powers to take on problemsin the junk market.   In a tepid March 29 letter to Sen. Riegle, SEC ChairmanRichard Breeden said, &quot;The staff of the (SEC) Division ofEnforcement is examining trading activity in certain issuesof junk bonds or `high-yield' debt.&quot; Mr. Breeden added that&quot;We believe the commission will be able to respondeffectively to any abuses that exist&quot; and that legislativeaction would be &quot;premature.&quot;   Mr. Breeden declined in the letter to elaborate on the SECinquiry, saying all SEC investigations must remainconfidential.   But despite its inquiry into the trading activities ofmembers of creditors committees, the SEC -- in another,contradictory move -- said it was proper for financialinstitutions that are members of creditors' committees totrade in the securities of bankrupt companies. The SECstressed, however, that such institutions must have &quot;Chinesewalls&quot; in place to prevent the misuse of inside information.The SEC took this position last month in a court brief filedin the Federated Department Stores Inc./Allied Stores Corp.bankruptcy case.   Some securities lawyers say that the SEC will have a toughtime making insider-trading cases in the junk market. &quot;Underexisting law, it would be difficult for the SEC to bring aninsider-trading case, absent unusual circumstances,&quot; in thejunk-bond area, says Harvey Pitt, a former SEC generalcounsel. David Brodsky, a New York lawyer who representsseveral financial institutions, says &quot;the SEC will have tofind a really dirty case to make&quot; new insider-trading law inthe junk-bond market.   But some active junk investors believe that regulatorsshould police junk bonds in the same way as stocks becausethey usually trade in tandem with the equity market. &quot;Asecurity is a security, whether it's an equity or a junkbond,&quot; says Fidelity's Mr. Harmetz. &quot;The SEC has anobligation to enforce insider trading in this area, just asthey would with stocks.&quot;   Yet even those SEC commissioners who favor such actionbelieve the agency's hands may be tied. &quot;People here can bepretty creative about legal theories,&quot; says CommissionerPhilip Lochner Jr. &quot;The question is not whether thecommission has the will to do it; it's whether it will standup in court.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
