They plunge into a dark,mucky cave, fleeing with Robin Hood from two feral dogsunleashed by the evil Sheriff of Nottingham.   Ah, not to worry: Robin lets loose an arrow, which piercesthe sheriff's heart, and then he skips off to his forest lairto do some medieval partying. Lo, what's this? Robin isswilling mead and presiding over a banquet table spread withlots of deliciously fake 700-year-old food: acrylic roasthog's head and a tureen of what appears to be multi-colored,vibrating Jello.</LP><TEXT>   Did they have fun in Sherwood Forest, or what?   As visitors leave the time machine -- actually a series ofcartoonish dioramas viewed from a carousel chair slidingalong a track -- Maid Marian asks: &quot;Would you like to have ago at shooting the sheriff?&quot;   Robin Hood, a 13th-century outlaw, is in. So what if hemay be mostly myth? So what if Maid Marian is really Frenchand Friar Tuck and Robin were never pals. Robin has capturedthe public imagination for perhaps 700 years, and these dayslots of people are trying to capture -- and cash in on -- theman in Lincoln green.   Maid Marian, the time-machine conductor, wearing a greenburlap dress, is in real life Liz Baxter. She works part-timeas Robin's legendary paramour at &quot;Tales of Robin Hood,&quot; atwo-year-old tourist attraction plunked down in the concretejungle of modern-day Nottingham. Robin, in green tights, isrecreated by Tyrone Quinn, in real life Ms. Baxter'sboyfriend. &quot;This is what I get for getting involved with MaidMarian,&quot; he says.   It isn't exactly Disneyland, but the $3.5 million facilityattracted 150,000 visitors last year and is hoping for a lotmore this year. Twenty miles north (past the Maid Mariandiner and a Robin Hood Express tour-bus company), the countypark that encompasses what's left of Sherwood Forest, isgleefully girding for a similar onslaught.   The reason for such optimism: What glitters on Hollywood'ssilver screen is almost certain to turn to gold on this sideof the Atlantic, where Robin has been slowly mutating fromfolk hero to icon of the tourist industry. After a 15-yearcinematic interregnum, the king of outlaws is back, in notone but two movies.   The first, called &quot;Robin Hood,&quot; shown recently on FoxTelevision in the U.S. and currently in British cinemas, is akind of gritty fish-and-chips western starring Patrick Berginas a Saxon noble driven to outlawry by greedy, sinisterNorman overlords. The other, &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,&quot;set to open June 14, is a $50 million extravaganza starringswashbuckling heartthrob Kevin Costner.   This resurgence of Robin mania is turning tourismofficials in Nottinghamshire, Robin's putative hangout, intovery merry men. They have teamed up with local hotels andtour operators to offer bargainpriced &quot;In Search of RobinHood&quot; weekends (&quot;The hotel rooms feature little johns,&quot; jokesone tourism official). To add to the realism, visitors toSherwood can dine on gruel at a diner built to approximate atree-house lair, or go dashing through the forest chasingRobin Hood dress-alikes.   These Hollywood-styled highwaymen won't rob you, but holdon to your wallets anyway. The local souvenir industry isbusy grinding out tons of bric-a-brac. Thebow-and-rubber-tipped arrow sets, at $20, seem a littlepricey, and other treasures have the scent of medievalrelic-peddlers all over them. A Robin Hood audio tape turnsout to be a badly bowdlerized children's tale setincongruously to music from the &quot;Nutcracker Suite.&quot;   &quot;In terms of the local economy, Robin means loads ofmoney,&quot; says Shaukat Khan. Mr. Khan, a Pakistan native, is ayouth worker by profession but is more widely known in theseparts as the Sheriff of Nottingham, the elected ceremonialheir to the office once held by Robin's archenemy. Thesheriff's job in recent years has largely been to defendRobin against historical naysayers, some of whom continue toinsist there is more myth than truth to the Robin Hoodlegend.   In fact, the latest battles involving Robin have beenfought by the pen instead of the sword. Two years ago, forexample, a number of local tourism officials were publiclyflogged (in the press) by a former sheriff who was seethingover a brochure that debunked the standing of both MaidMarian and Friar Tuck.   Though the offending publication was swiftly pulled fromprint, most scholars agree that Marian is a fictionalcharacter borrowed from a medieval French poem and insertedinto the Robin Hood tales in the late 15th century to addromance. And Friar Tuck, though a real-life outlaw,terrorized travelers in Sherwood a full 150 years after Robinwould have lived. Like Marian, Tuck was simply woven into thestory by later spinners of the tale.   All of which raises some central questions: Was Robin Hoodhimself real? What was his actual connection to Nottinghamand Sherwood Forest? And what will you see if you visit?   J.C. Holt, a Cambridge author of the definitive scholarlytome on Robin Hood, says the legend may have sprung from theexploits of Robert Hod, a tenant-farmer-turned-outlaw fromYorkshire who stalked Sherwood Forest after being declared afugitive by the courts in 1226.   But Mr. Holt also thinks that the protagonist of thesurviving medieval Robin Hood manuscripts is a &quot;compositefigure&quot; of various rogues stitched together over twocenturies by traveling minstrels who had a stake inlocalizing the tale. Mr. Holt has another jolt: The originalRobin was more hood than hero -- he robbed priests and hegave to the poor in return for securing places to hide fromthe sheriff.   &quot;The original tales were crude, despicable,&quot; says Mr.Holt. They appealed to &quot;young louts hanging out in pubs.&quot;   As for Nottingham and Sherwood Forest, they certainlyappear in the original Robin Hood tales -- but so do villagesin Yorkshire, to the north.   Sherwood, the 100,000-acre forest where Robin poached theking's red deer, is largely covered by towns, farms andhousing developments. What's left is 450 scenic acres of oakand glade squeezed into a county park. Sherwood's onlyremaining physical link to Robin Hood is the presence of amassive old oak said to be Robin's actual gathering place.   A trek to the tree, however, proves enigmatic. Numeroussigns describe the natural virtues of Sherwood (it is home to218 species of spiders, which probably kept Robin busychecking his boots). But a sign describing the oak seems tosaw away at the notion that this could really have beenRobin's lair. It notes the probability that the tree is nomore than 500 years old -- and even at 700 years old wouldhave been a mere sapling in the days of Robin Hood.   As for the medieval Nottingham of Robin's time, it waslargely torn down to make way for a 19th-century industrialcity; only a tower to a 13th-century castle and a medievalhouse, used as a lace factory, survive. Still, Robin mightrecognize himself in a more-modern Nottingham landmark, animpressive bronze statue depicting Robin, bow at the ready,poised for combat beneath the ancient tower.   He might also identify with the hoodlums who, over asuccessive number of years, stole the bronzed arrow right outfrom under Robin's fingertips. City fathers only recentlystopped the thefts with clever modern alchemy: They weldedthe arrow to Robin's bow.</TEXT></DOC>
