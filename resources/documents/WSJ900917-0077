Robert White, president of the Canadian Auto Workersunion, said the two sides were still &quot;miles apart&quot; overeconomic issues such as wages, vacations and cost-of-livingallowances. &quot;Another couple of days of this and we'll have todiscuss seriously recessing the talks,&quot; he said.</LP><TEXT>   A breakdown in negotiations likely would drag out thestrike long enough to begin hobbling some of Ford's key U.S.plants, which depend on parts, especially engines, made inCanada. Ford has said it would need to begin closing some ofits U.S. operations within two weeks of a Canadian strike.   Ford Canada spokesman James Hartford said a prolongedstrike could further hurt the company at a time of economicslowdown and increasingly competitive markets. Ford Canadahas forecast sales in the current model year, which endsSept. 30, of 992,000 cars and 453,000 trucks, representing adecline of 9% from the previous year.   Mr. Hartford acknowledged that &quot;considerable differences&quot;separated the two sides. Nevertheless he hinted that thecompany could make a new contract offer to the union by earlythis week.   &quot;We want this to be a short strike. Obviously the ball isin our court,&quot; Mr. Hartford said.   The union began negotiations Sept. 5 after selecting Fordas a contract target. Since then, the company has made onecontract offer, which was swiftly rejected by the union. Theunion claimed the company wasn't offering nearly enoughmoney. A counteroffer by the union was similarly turned downby Ford.   Any contract reached at Ford will serve as the basis forsubsequent negotiations with the Canadian subsidiaries ofGeneral Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. Contracts at each ofthe Big Three auto makers, covering a total of 61,000 workersin Canada, expired Friday.   The strike, the first against Ford in North America since1976, has shut nine Ford plants in Canada. The largest ofthose affected is the company's St. Thomas, Ontario, assemblyplant, which is the sole source for the large Mercury GrandMarquis and Ford Crown Victoria models.   In addition, Ford's Windsor, Ontario, engine plant buildsthe six-cylinder unit for the Lincoln Continental luxury car.Company officials said the highly profitable Wixom, Mich.,plant that builds the Continental likely would be the firstU.S. operation to be hurt by a lengthy strike in Canada.   Another Ford plant, in Niagara Falls, Ontario, is the soleprovider of auto glass to four of the company's light-truckassembly operations in the U.S. In all, about 80% of Ford'sCanadian output is exported to the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
