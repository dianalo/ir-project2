His overall job-approval rating in a new Wall StreetJournal/NBC News poll dips to 64% from 70% a month ago;voters disapprove of his performance on the economy by 51% to41%. In one key barometer of the national mood, voters by 49%to 33% say the country is on the wrong track -- wiping outthe brief surge of optimism after the collapse of Sovietcommunism.</LP><TEXT>   A Bush veto of the bill expanding jobless benefits wouldbe tough to sustain: 58% in the poll favor the measure, andsix of the 13 GOP senators siding with the Democrats face thevoters next year. Seeking a pro-growth agenda, Sununupromises Sen. Gramm that Bush will vocally back his plan tojump-start the economy through a capital-gains tax cut,expanded IRAs and other tax incentives.   While 59% of voters think Bush isn't doing enough tocombat the recession, 71% think Congress isn't either. TheFed fares a bit better.                                                                                                          SENTIMENT SLOWLY BUILDS for deep U.S. defense reductions.   The new Journal/NBC poll finds 42%, up from 37% in March,say U.S. defense spending is too high; only 10% say spendingis too low. A surprisingly large minority -- more than fourin 10 -- believe defense can be halved by decade's end.   While few voters think a major war is likely in the nextfive years, 44% think another conflict like the Gulf War islikely, and 32% expect Panama-style quick operations.Reflecting such concerns, Air Force Secretary Rice says thePentagon's Special Operations are &quot;the only part of the forcethat's bound to grow.&quot; Also resistant to deep cuts, Pentagonofficials say, will be funds for the C-17 cargo plane, cargoships and surveillance satellites critical to suchoperations.                                                                                                          DEMOCRATIC HOPEFULS stir little public interest but rushto set their teams.   Of the expected presidential candidates, only Jerry Brown,at 11%, breaks double digits in the Journal/NBC poll; that ismostly the product of name recognition. The others all arebunched at 5% to 7%. &quot;It is more wide-open than any race forthe nomination we've seen,&quot; say the pollsters who conductedthe survey, Democrat Peter Hart and Republican Robert Teeter.   Harkin draws liberal activists -- such as former Rep. TobyMoffett -- but still lacks a media expert and pollster.Kerrey draws some of the best Gary Hart veterans, plus a fewMondale aides, such as guru John Reilly. Clinton has highlyregarded Frank Greer for media and Stan Greenberg forpolling.   But Clinton's offers of top jobs are declined by formerDukakis chief John Sasso and Mondale operative Tom Donilon.                                                                                                          HEAVYWEIGHTS: The addition of Cuomo and Jackson to thefield would turn things upside down, the poll finds. Cuomoleads with 29%, while Jackson gets 20%; no one else gets morethan 6%. The New York governor trounces Brown in the West,Kerrey and Harkin in the Midwest, Clinton and Wilder in theSouth and Tsongas in the Northeast.                                                                                                          THOMAS GETS a boost from his confirmation hearings. Thepoll finds 46% favor his confirmation, up from 35% in July,while opposition, 12%, is virtually unchanged. Some 38% don'texpect him to side with either conservatives or liberals mostof the time.                                                                                                          NUNN'S SUPPORT for extending public hearings on Gatescheers foes of the CIA nominee, who must have the influentialGeorgian's vote to have a chance of derailing the nomination.The poll finds voters with an opinion closely divided onGates's confirmation, but more than six in 10 don't have anopinion.                                                                                                          GORBACHEV STAGES a comeback among U.S. voters, who nowprefer him to Yeltsin as Soviet leader by three to one;immediately after the failed coup, Yeltsin had narrowed themargin to 47%-27%. U.S. officials say Yeltsin blundered inseeking to put all Soviet nuclear weapons in Russia, a stepthat set off alarm bells in the U.S. as well as elsewhere inthe Soviet Union.                                                                                                          SOVIETS SEEK more U.S. food assistance -- and are likelyto get it.   Soviet pleas for aid grow more desperate: Officials warnU.S. visitors that food riots could yet trigger a popularrevolt against the government. U.S. officials are skeptical,saying many Soviet citizens have accumulated huge hoards offood in their homes. But more U.S. aid is nonetheless likely-- in part because it's popular with U.S. voters and farmers.   The Journal/NBC poll shows that 57% favor helping theSoviets strengthen their economy, up from 51% last month and38% in July 1990. The Bush administration eases terms foranother $200 million in farm export credit guarantees for theSoviets.   Officials worry that lawmakers may try to use the Sovietsituation to force a sweeping overhaul of U.S. farm exportprograms.                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: Despite the fall of Castro's Soviet patrons,voters by 51% to 31% think he'll still be in charge of Cuba ayear from now. . . . With both Jackson and Wilder in thefield, black voters right now would prefer Jackson by 49% to7%.</TEXT></DOC>
