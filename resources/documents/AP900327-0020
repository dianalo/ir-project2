The refugees have topped 700 and are stretching the means ofmunicipal authorities in the Baltic port of Swinoujscie, the PAPnews agency said.   The official news agency said the refugees first began arrivingby ferry from Sweden on Thursday and that at least 300 had beendenied entry by that country. It said Poland's government hasappealed to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva foradvice on how to deal with the situation.   Elzbieta Piela-Mielczarek, the mayor of Swinoujscie, also sent acable to the commissioner appealing for assistance because the citydoes not have the means to provide basic care, PAP said.   The Polish government, in the midst of implementing radicaleconomic reforms that are seriously taxing the Polish people, hasnevertheless decided to grant funds to take care of the refugeesand has assured them free medical treatment, the agency reported.   Television showed pictures of the refugees, including childrenhuddled with their baggage. The report also showed refugees inSwedish buses that were loaded onto a ferry. It said some refugeeswere not allowed out of the buses during the 20-hour trip acrossthe Baltic.   ``Here at least is democracy,'' one refugee said in thetelevision report. Most of the refugees hid their faces from thetelevision camera, however.   ``We escaped from Lebanon because there is war,'' one teen-agegirl said.   The Polish government has ordered border officials to check thedocuments of foreigners boarding ferries in the city of Swinoujscieto see if they have valid entry visas for Sweden, PAP said.   Forged Swedish visas can be bought in Poland on the black marketfrom Arabs for $200 to $2,000, according to the television report.   Many of the refugees have run out of money, PAP said. About 300of the refugees were being lodged at vacation homes belonging totwo power plants, and another 400 were being housed in privatehomes, the agency said.   Over the weekend, Jacek Piechota, a parliamentary deputy fromthe port of Szczecin, about 50 miles south of Swinoujscie, appealedto Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki to take action to resolve thesituation.</TEXT></DOC>
