(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's top military officialpraised blacks' contributions in U.S. wars at a ceremony Saturdayopening construction of a monument to the ``buffalo soldiers'' whofought in the West.   The Buffalo Soldier Monument will honor all black Americansoldiers, said Gen. Colin Powell, the first black chairman of theJoint Chiefs of Staff.   ``From pre-Revolutionary times through the Revolutionary War,through every one of our wars and on up to the present, black menand women have willingly served and died,'' Powell said.   ``But for most of that time blacks served without recognition orreward for the contribution they made for our freedom,'' he said,adding that it was ``freedom they did not enjoy here in their ownbeloved native land.''   The monument is planned for the Fort Leavenworth grounds nearSmith Lake in northeast Kansas, where the buffalo soldiers of the10th Regiment once camped between campaigns against Indians on theGreat Plains.   ``America has made enormous progress from the days of thebuffalo soldiers to the days of a black chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff,'' Powell said. ``We aren't perfect. We never willbe. But the beauty of this country is that we're always makingprogress.''   Powell serves as the top military adviser to the president, thesecretary of defense and the National Security Council.   The 9th and 10th Calvary Regiments of buffalo soldiers wereformed by Congress in 1866 to patrol the western frontier. It wasthe Indians who dubbed black men who served in the segregatedregiments the ``buffalo soldiers.''   In their service from the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, thebuffalo soldiers endured discrimination, hardships and neglect thatwhite regiments didn't have to suffer. They protected settlers,built forts and fought Apaches and Comanches on the Great Plainsand along the Texas border.   The monument's design calls for a large bronze statue of arifle-carrying buffalo soldier on a horse. In the design, thesoldier stands on rocks between two ponds _ one behind him torepresent the past and a reflective pool in front to see into thefuture.   Water will flow over the rocks into the reflective pool.</TEXT></DOC>
