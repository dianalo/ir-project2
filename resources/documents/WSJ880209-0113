PAUL, Minn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing Co. said it is withdrawing certain models of its air ionizers from use in packaging food, beverages, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.    The move followed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's suspension three weeks ago of sales of the devices, after they were discovered to be leaking radiation at Ashland Chemical Co. plants in Easton, Pa., and Dallas. Ashland Chemical is a unit of Ashland, Ky.-based Ashland Oil Inc.    A spokesman for Ashland said the company tested workers at the two plants and determined that none had been harmed. The company expects to finish cleaning up the plants this week and to resume full production, he added. However, he said: &quot;When our facilities open, we will not be using 3M air ionizers. We will be using a different type of technology.&quot;    An NRC spokesman said 25 facilities, including several Coca-Cola bottling plants, have reported finding problems with the devices.    Minnesota Mining maintained that the air ionizers, which use a radioactive material to keep industrial facilities free of dust, don't threaten public health or safety. But the company said it is withdrawing about 1,500 of the 20,000 devices in use nationwide &quot;to prevent any public misperception about the safety of both the ionizers and their use in industry.&quot;    A spokesman said 3M would discuss &quot;how to ensure the reliable use&quot; of the remaining devices with NRC officials this week, when it reports on the results of its tests of about 10% of the ionizers in use around the country.    The spokesman said the tests indicate that ceramic microspheres, housing a radioactive source known as polonium 210, have escaped from the devices in some cases because the epoxy binder holding them in place was exposed to moisture, oil or other foreign matter in the device's compressed-air line or to solvent-laden air.    The company said the microspheres are too big to be inhaled and, if ingested, would pass quickly through the body without any harmful side effects.    The ionizers in question -- models 902, 902F, 906 and 908 -- use poloniun 210 to eliminate electrostatic charges. The emitted material, known as alpha particles, can't penetrate human skin, 3M said. </TEXT></DOC>
