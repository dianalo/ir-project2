The General Accounting Office report, released by Sen. JohnGlenn, D-Ohio, also said Army contractors are being permitted torequisition material from Pentagon supplies without beingidentified as contractors, as required by regulations.   Glenn said the Defense Department estimated that Armycontractors held about $2.8 billion in government-furnishedmaterial as of the end of fiscal 1987.   ``We have created a large potential problem by givingcontractors ready access to billions of dollars' worth ofgovernment property,'' said Glenn. ``Fiscal restraint should not beAWOL at the Army.''   Government-furnished material, or GFM, includes parts,assemblies and other materials used in the production of tanks,aircraft and ships.   The Pentagon provides the material to contractors when it isdetermined to be in the government's best interest. And the Armyallows contractors to obtain the material through direct access tothe defense supply system.   ``The Army does not have in place the management control andreporting systems that DOD requires to adequately control GFMprovided to contractors,'' the GAO concluded.   The GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said the Army expectsto have a new management-control system in place by June 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
