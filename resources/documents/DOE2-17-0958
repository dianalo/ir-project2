The current state of coalproduction and exports in South Africa, China, North America, USSR andPoland, Australia, Colombia and Venezuela are reviewed. Forecasts ofsteam coal trade to 2000 suggest that sales will increase rapidly intothe 1990s as new power plant comes on stream. Growth will particularlybe seen in Asia and the Mediterranean area.
