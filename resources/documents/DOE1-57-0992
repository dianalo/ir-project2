The success of the compositetube truss structure depends on its stability to long-term exposure tothe low earth orbit environment with particular emphasis placed on atomicoxygen. Concepts for protectively coating graphite/epoxy tubes includeuse of inorganic coated metal foils and electroplating. These coatingswere applied to graphite/epoxy tubes and then subjected to simulatedLEO environment to evaluate survivability of coatings and coated tubes.1 reference, 6 figures, 1 table.</TEXT></DOC>
