(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Colt Firearms Division said a ruling thatit rehire 800 strikers with back pay could cost the gunmaker lessthan $16 million, not the $40 million estimated by the union.   An administrative law judge, Martin Roth, said in a rulingreleased Monday that Colt had engaged in dozens of unfair laborpractices during the 3{-year-old strike, and he ordered the workers'reinstatement.   The United Auto Workers and Colt said Tuesday it was too early tosay whether they would appeal the ruling to the National LaborRelations Board.   Colt Industries spokesman Michael Dunn on Tuesday estimated thecompany's total liability at less than $6 million. He declined tosay how the company arrived at the figure.   Robert Madore, a regional official with the UAW, stuck by hisestimate that the back wages totaled $40 million, or an average of$50,000 per worker.   ``I don't know how they come up with their figure,'' Madore said.``I think they're going to have to sharpen their pencil.''   Madore speculated that the discrepancy stemmed from a companyoffer at some point during the strike to let 50 strikers return towork. Roth's ruling said the company must pay back wages to strikers``to the date of a valid offer of reinstatement.''   ``If they have 50 job openings and they offer 50 jobs to 800workers, does that stop the back pay? It can't realistically,''Madore said.</TEXT></DOC>
