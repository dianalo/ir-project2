The compounds selected for the studyincluded 153 semivolatile organic compounds on Appendix VIII to 40 CFRPart 261 (including the Michigan List, Federal Register, December 21,1984), that is a previous part of the program had shown to be amenableto gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric (GC/MS) analysis. The extractionefficiency from water and seven-day aqueous stability of the compoundswere determined to provide in part, basic information for the finalizationof a subset of Appendix VIII suitable for groundwater monitoring.</TEXT></DOC>
