<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-59-1245 </DOCNO><TEXT>Angiography of the cerebral and visceral arterial systems is performedmuch less frequently than it was before the advent of computed tomographicscanning (CT). Most institutions have experienced at least a 50% reductionin the number of angiograms performed since installing a CT scanner.However, angiography still plays an important role in the confirmationof diagnoses made using a scanner, and in providing valuable informationto the surgeon prior to excision of tumors or the repair of traumatizedorgans. Recently a number of sophisticated therapeutic procedures requiringvascular catheterization and the injection of contrast agents have beendeveloped. In these procedures catheters are selectively placed in bloodvessels perfusing a pathological process, such as an arteriovenous malformation,or at the site of an arterial stenosis; embolization of the arteriovenousmalformation or tumor, or dilatation of the stenotic segment, is thenperformed. Whether the vessel catheterization is for diagnostic or therapeuticpurposes, the basic approach is the same, and the technologist's dutiesare similar. The principal difference between a diagnostic and a therapeuticprocedure is the length of time required to carry out the study; therapeuticprocedures often require significantly longer periods of general anesthesiaor sedation than do diagnostic studies.</TEXT></DOC>
