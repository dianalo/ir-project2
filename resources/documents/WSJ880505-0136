Transforms 'Lazy Assets' Into No. 4 Telecommunications Service </HL><AUTHOR> Thomas Petzinger Jr. (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> WMB </CO><IN> TEL </IN><DATELINE> TULSA, Okla.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In Joseph Williams's view, they were &quot;lazy assets,&quot; and Williams Cos. had too many of them. Specifically, they were pipelines, obsolete after decades of use.    Then, an aide proposed a solution: using the pipelines as underground corridors -- for fiber-optic cable. &quot;The idea seemed preposterous,&quot; Mr. Williams says.    Yet the logic seemed unassailable. By running telecommunications cable through the idle sections of its interstate pipelines, Williams Cos. could avoid the cost of purchasing rights of way and digging trenches. And in the brave new world of deregulated telecommunications, Williams could offer phone companies and others the security of a so-called hardened system, virtually invulnerable to breaks.    &quot;I had to summon all my courage,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I'll never forget walking into that board meeting and saying, 'Here's what we ought to do, but I can't give you a marketing study.'&quot;    That was five years ago. Today, Williams has become the nation's fourth-largest purveyor of long-distance telecommunications service, after American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., US Sprint Communications Co. and MCI Communications Corp.    Last year, the Williams telecommunications unit accounted for only a small portion of the company's $1.78 billion in revenue. But after barely a year of full operations, Williams Telecommunications Group now is hauling in revenue at an annual rate of about $125 million. What's more, the whole operation became profitable in February.    The birth of Williams's fiber-optics business was only the latest event in a corporate history full of sometimes wild diversification -- and severe retrenchment. Founded near the turn of the century by two sidewalk-paving brothers in Arkansas, Williams earned its first distinction for deal-making by shelling out nearly $300 million to buy a pipeline in the mid-1960s -- the biggest acquisition ever, until Howard Hughes bought Trans World Airlines later in the decade.    Williams used cash from the highly profitable pipeline to finance entries into insurance, appliance stores and other farflung ventures, many of which it eventually dumped. Then, after Joe Williams had taken over the leadership from his cousin John in 1978, he launched a campaign to make the company &quot;inflation-proof,&quot; gobbling up such cyclical resources as oil and gas, coal and farm fertilizers.    The strategy worked -- briefly, until oil and gas, coal and farm fertilizer all went bust in the deflation of the early and mid-1980s. &quot;I didn't expect Mr. Reagan would so substantially alter our economic destiny,&quot; Mr. Williams explains.    He began fearing a possible dividend cut. The stock price sank. Worst of all, he says, &quot;Somebody might have bought the company with the intention of breaking it up.&quot;    Mr. Williams thus launched a divestiture binge that ended only last year, ultimately raising more than $1.2 billion in cash -- money that the company plowed not only into reducing debt and upgrading its its natural-gas pipelines, but also into transforming old pipelines into new telephone lines.    Williams laced fiber-optic cable through the system by boring into the pipelines at intervals of three miles and pulling the strands through. In areas where Williams's pipelines were still busily hauling hydrocarbons, the company at least owned the rights of way -- and still could boast to customers that its ubiquitous above-ground &quot;danger&quot; signs would help prevent explosion-wary contractors and others from digging near the telecommunications lines.    &quot;The next best thing to being inside a pipeline,&quot; Mr. Williams says, &quot;is to be alongside a pipeline.&quot;    Today, Williams Telecommunications Group owns 4,600 miles of fiber-optics cable, as well as 800 miles of microwave line, enabling it to provide coast-to-coast long-distance service. And in addition to the company's natural-gas pipelines, which it is continuing to upgrade and expand, the telecommunications system will receive much of the cash that is still coming in from asset sales.    But not all of the company's growth has been internal. For instance, Williams has turned outside -- through acquisitions and otherwise -- for much of its telecommunications expertise. &quot;If I tried to razzle-dazzle you with megabytes and gigahertz,&quot; Mr. Williams demurs, &quot;you'd know I was a phony.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
