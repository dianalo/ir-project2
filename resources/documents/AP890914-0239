Because of the job reductions, severance pay and other costs, theDallas-based electronics giant will take a $10 million charge in itscurrent fiscal quarter, said TI spokesman Stan Victor.   He said Wednesday the departures are in addition to 230 jobseliminated in the defense electronics group announced in August.   Cuts were made to control expenses and to adjust to changes inthe defense group's business, Victor had said earlier. Older defenseprograms are being replaced with newer programs that require lessmetal, he said.   Although Texas Instruments takes the multimillion-dollar chargeagainst profits in the current quarter, ``this reduction will lowercosts in this group on a look-forward basis,'' the company said in astatement.   By this month's end, the combination of voluntary and involuntaryjob cuts will reduce employment in the Defense Systems andamp; ElectronicsGroup to roughly 23,000 workers.   The company said in January it planned to cut its nationwide workforce by up to 1,000, including up to 700 employees in North Texasin a voluntary termination and retirement program.   Demand from makers of electronic equipment is slowing for memorychips, at the same time competitors are increasing their productionof such chips, the company said.</TEXT></DOC>
