It was entitled &quot;Our Base Ball Club and How It Wonthe Championship,&quot; and recounted the exploits of a small-townteam formed by the city fathers to boost civic pride. Onehundred years later, a writer named Marjorie Lewis wrote abook that also dealt almost exclusively with baseball. It wasentitled &quot;Wrongway Applebaum,&quot; and recounted the exploits ofa dyslexic fifth-grader who desperately struggles to masterthe sport, eventually hits a dramatic, last-at-bat homer towin the big game, but in vintage dyslexic fashion, circlesthe bases backward. Obviously, times had changed.   This informal history of baseball fiction comes to us fromAndy McCue, author of &quot;Baseball by the Books: A History andComplete Bibliography of Baseball Fiction&quot; (Wm. C. Brown, 164pages, $19.95), which is one of the oddest entries of this orany year. Mercifully, Mr. McCue's rather dry history ofbaseball fiction takes up only a few pages; most of the bookconsists of thumbnail descriptions of the hundreds ofbaseball-oriented novels or story collections that haveappeared in the past century or so. Though most of thesebooks are aimed at juvenile readers, there are alsomysteries, pornography (Lust League), and serious novels byauthors such as Bernard Malamud (&quot;The Natural&quot;), RobertCoover (&quot;The Universal Baseball Association: J. Henry Waugh,Proprietor&quot;), and Philip Roth, author of the unclassifiablybrilliant &quot;The Great American Novel.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. McCue, a veteran journalist who once worked in the FarEast, and apparently quite a straight arrow, generallyforgoes the immense satirical possibilities in writing aboutbooks as ghastly as those that appear herein. An example is&quot;The Yachtsville Boys&quot; (1869), whose teen ballplayer hero&quot;regrets tearing his pants during the action and forfeiting achance to earn money to help his poor but hardworkingmother.&quot; Seeking to atone for his dastardly deeds on thediamond, he hangs up his spikes, &quot;becomes a true Christian,&quot;and winds up as a missionary in Hindustan.&quot; Just as JoseCanseco will.   Equally idiotic is &quot;Stay Loose,&quot; which describes a groupof social scientists who &quot;try to create the perfect baseballteam by bringing in athletic South Pacific Islanders whowon't get choked up by the pressures of the game.&quot; &quot;Freddyand the Baseball Team From Mars&quot; deals with a pig detectivewho is tracking a kidnapped Martian while organizing a localteam in his spare time. And &quot;Muckaluck&quot; focuses on theMuckaluck Indian War of 1873, precipitated by a cavalryman'sspiking an Indian second baseman. Or was it a Brave?   In addition to such obvious subjects as Martians,leprechauns, ghosts, genies, lefthanded piano-playingpitchers who forsake the mound for Mozart after beaningsomeone, and homicidal maniacs, drunks also play a large partin works of this genre. In &quot;Saturday Night Dead,&quot; we meetHarvey Blissberg, a utility player who gives up his career tobecome a private eye after his roommate is murdered. His jobis &quot;to keep the American League MVP sober for the week he'sscheduled to host `Saturday Night Live.'&quot; &quot;Never Come Back&quot;features a player who drinks himself out of the majors andthen comes back with the Phillies. It is not clear whetherthis is a step up or down.   Other themes that occur again and again in these sagas ofswat are religion, politics and incurable diseases. In&quot;Sister Beatrice Goes to Bat,&quot; Catherine Corley Andersonwrites of a junior high school nun who forms a baseball teamto help a refugee from the 1956 Hungarian uprising adjust toAmerica. In &quot;Nice Guy, Go Home,&quot; a young Amish ballplayermust renounce his heritage in order to make it to the bigs.&quot;In Spitballs and Holy Water,&quot; &quot;a black nun pitches againstthe 1927 Yankees, striking out Babe Ruth and later the Devilhimself.&quot; Speaking of devils, the evil empire surfaces in &quot;APennant for the Kremlin,&quot; as well as in Dave Palmer's&quot;Diamond Mystery,&quot; wherein the hero unearths the secret ofhis team's first baseman's erratic play: His father is acommunist from Puerto Rico. The kid probably had troublemoving to his right.   Uplifting, life-affirming triumphs over disease orphysical deformity are the linchpins of several dubiousvolumes. In addition to &quot;Wrongway Applebaum,&quot; Mr. McCue listssuch books as &quot;It's Your Turn at Bat,&quot; in which thedesignated hitter for a Little League team has cerebralpalsy, and &quot;The Short-Stop&quot; (1909), which features ahunchback lucky enough to be adopted by the altruistic hero.That story was written by the immortal Zane Grey, who had abrief career in the minors before becoming a major writer.   Many of the books are alluring if only for their titles.Who could resist &quot;Two Strikes, Four Eyes,&quot; whose protagonistis &quot;torn between the embarrassments of wearing glasses orstriking out all the time&quot;? Nevertheless, my personalfavorite is &quot;Rachel, the Rabbi's Wife,&quot; a 1978 novel in which&quot;a woman finds some relief from a disappointing marriage bysharing her son's passion for the New York Mets.&quot; In 1978,the Mets traded Tom Seaver to the Reds for a bunch of stiffsand immediately began their voyage to the bottom of thedivision. Must have been some marriage.</TEXT></DOC>
