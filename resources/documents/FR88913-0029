Background</ITAG>The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (the new law) (Pub. L. 100-293,102 Stat. 95) was signed into law by the President on April 22, 1988. Thenew law amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C.321 <T3>et seq.</T3>) as follows:(1) Requires State licensing of wholesale drug distributors under Federalguidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling, and recordkeeping;(2) Bans the reimportation of prescription drugs for human use producedin the United States, except when reimported by the manufacturer or foremergency use;(3) Bans the sale, trade, or purchase of drug samples;(4) Bans trafficking in or counterfeiting of drug coupons;(5) Mandates storage, handling, and recordkeeping requirements for drugsamples;(6) Requires practitioners to request drug samples in writing;(7) Prohibits with certain exceptions the resale of prescription drugspurchased by hospitals or health care facilities; and(8) Sets forth criminal and civil penalties for violations of these provisions.This proposed rule sets forth guidelines for minimum standards, conditions,and terms for State licensing of wholesale prescription drug distributors.Promulgation of this rule will implement that part of the new law, whichprovides that no person may engage in the wholesale distribution in interstatecommerce of drugs subject to section 505(b) of the act (prescription drugs)in a State unless such person is licensed by the State in accordance withfederally-prescribed minimum standards, conditions, and terms, as set forthin guidelines issued as a regulation by the agency (21 U.S.C. 353(e)(2)(A)and (B)).In developing these guidelines, the agency has followed the recommendationof the House of Representatives' Committee on Energy and Commerce thatit consider the Guidelines for the Inspection of Wholesalers issued bythe National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP). It has also consideredthe Proposed Uniform Standards of Practice for Wholesale Drug Distribution,which has been adopted by the National Wholesale Druggists' Association(NWDA). Finally, the agency has considered public comments which it hasalready received on this matter. Copies of correspondence and other communicationsto the agency on this topic have been placed on file with the Dockets ManagementBranch (address above) and are available for review under this docket numberbetween 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Provisions of the Proposed Rule</ITAG>A. ScopeSection 205.1 states that the regulation applies to all wholesale drugdistributors.B. PurposeSection 205.2 states that the purpose of the regulation is to implementthe Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987.C. DefinitionsSection 205.3 sets forth definitions as they apply to this regulation.Terms defined include ``drug sample,'' ``manufacturers'', ``prescriptiondrug'', ``wholesale distribution'', and ``wholesale distributors''.D. Wholesale Drug Distributor Licensing RequirementSection 205.4 sets forth the requirement that a wholesale distributor belicensed by a State.E. Minimum Required Information for LicensureSection 205.5 sets forth minimum information to be required from each licensee,such as the licensee's trade name or names, principal address and telephonenumber, the address(es) and telephone number(s) of each facility, and thenames of corporate or proprietary principals and contact persons.F. Minimum QualificationsSection 205.6 sets forth certain minimum qualifications for licensing.State atuhorities are called upon to consider an applicant's past history,including any criminal violations, which may reflect upon the applicant'sability to prevent drug diversion. Where granting a license would not bein the public interest, State authorities may deny a license to an applicant.The agency believes that careful screening of applicants is necessary andprudent in reducing the opportunities for diversion of prescription drugs.G. PersonnelSection 205.7 sets forth minimum personnel standards for licensees. Empoyeesmust be qualified by education and/or experience to perform their duties.H. Violations and PenaltiesSection 205.8 provides for suspension or revocation of licenses, and permitsfines, improvement, or civil penalties upon conviction of violations ofFederal, State, or local drug laws.I. Minimum Requirements for the Storage and Handling of Prescription Drugsand for the Establishment and Maintenance of Prescription Drug DistributionRecordsSection 205.50 sets forth minimum requirements for the storage and handlingof prescription drugs (including storage and handling by representativesand agents), and for the establishment and maintenance of prescriptiondrug distribution records. These requirements, which reflect present industrystandards for good manufacturing practices for prescription drug storage,handling, and recordkeeping, include:1. <T3>Facilities.</T3> Paragraph (a) sets forth minimum requirements forstorage facilities. These facilities are required to have sufficient space,and environmental and security controls to assure that stored drugs donot become adulterated, or stolen and that damaged, adulterated, and misbrandeddrugs are segregated from other drug products.2. <T3>Security.</T3> Paragraph (b) establishes minimum security standards.Basic physical security measures are needed to deter theft of drugs andthe resulting divesion of stolen items. This paragraph also addresses theftby computer, where computerized inventory control systems could be compromisedand electronic records altered in order to hide and/or facilitate drugdiversion. 3. <T3>Storage.</T3> Paragraph (c) sets forth minimum standards for storageof prescription drugs. Emphasis is placed upon appropriate temperatureconditions because storage under adverse (usually elevated) temperaturesis a prime cause of drug deterioration. Because it is vital to maintainapropriate temperature conditions on a continuing basis, there must besuitable recording equipment and/or logs to document maintenance of propertemperatures.4. <T3>Examination of materials.</T3> Paragraph (d) requires detailed examinationof incoming and outgoing shipments. Such examinations are necessary toprevent acceptance and distribution of drugs which are contaminated orotherwise unfit for distribution.5.<T3> Returned, damaged, and outdated drugs.</T3> Paragraph (e) includesdetailed instructions for the handling of returned, damaged and outdateddrugs. Provisions in this paragraph are intended to prevent distributionof potentially adulterated or misbranded drugs which may have been damagedin storage, transit, or in possession of consignees.The accountability provisions in this paragraph will provide a high levelof protection againt drug diversion.6. <T3>Recordkeeping.</T3> Congress intended that the new law would resultin a higher level of accountability in the business practices of drug wholesalers.Paragraph (f) includes detailed minimum recordkeeping requirements, coveringall transactions regarding receipt and distribution or other dispositionof drugs. Such records are vital for achieving a high degree of accountabilityfor all prescription drug transactions, including returned drugs. The higherlevel of accountability will provide protection against drug diversion.7. <T3>Written policies and procedures.</T3> Paragraph (g) sets forth minimumstandards for the establishment and maintenance of detailed written policiesand procedures for the receipt, security, storage, inventory, and distributionof prescription drugs, including policies and procedures for identifying,recording, and reporting losses or thefts and for correcting all errorsand inaccuracies in inventories. Also mandated are procedures for conductingefficient drug recalls. By following preestablished procedures, a firmcan better assure proper storage and distribution of presciption drugson a consistent basis.8. <T3>Responsibility.</T3> Paragraph (h) requires the maintenance of listsof persons in responsible company positions. Clear delineation of individualresponsibilities in such lists provides a deterrent to drug diversion.9. <T3>Compliance with Federal, State, and local law.</T3> Paragraph (i) requireswholesale drug distributors to operate in compliance with all applicablelaws and regulations.10. <T3>Salvaging and reprocessing.</T3> Paragraph (j) states that wholesaledrug distributors are subject to any applicable Federal or State laws relatingto salvaging or reprocessing. Some salvaging operations are complex andnecessitate controls on a par with those used to originally manufacturethe drugs. Accordingly, current good manufacturing practice regulationsfor finished pharmaceuticals in 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211 are incorporated.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Impact Analysis </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12612: Federalism Executive Order 12612 requires Federal agencies to carefully examine regulatoryproposals to determine if they would have significant impact on federalism.The agency must assess the impact of the proposed rule on the States, ontheir relationship with the National Government, and on the distributionof power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. FDA is required by statute to issue a regulation that establishes a guidelinesetting forth minimum standards for State licensing of wholesale prescriptiondrug distributors. The regulation is to include minimum requirements forrecordkeeping, storage, and handling of prescription drugs. While someState laws might be preempted because they would not meet the minimum standardsin the regulation, States would be free to adopt standards that exceedthe minimum, would maintain maximum administrative discretion, would beable to develop their own policies to achieve program objectives, and wouldbe encouraged to work with appropriate officials in other States and inFDA. States will have an opportunity to participate in the developmentof these standards through the notice-and-comment rulemaking process. Twoyears after the issuance of the final rule, drug wholesalers in those Stateswhose laws do not meet these minimum standards will not be permitted todistribute prescription drugs. FDA certifies that it has examined the proposed rule, and while it mayhave a possible significant effect on federalism issues, the agency's actionis mandated by law, the agency has no discretion, and it must implementits legal mandate by regulation. B. Executive Order 12291: Regulatory Impact and the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (Pub. L. 96-354) The agency has examined the economic impact of this proposed rule in accordancewith Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354). The new law's requirements for State licensing of wholesale drug distributorsand the attendant requirements for minimum standards for recordkeeping,storage, and handling of prescription drugs pose potential economic implicationsfor wholesale drug distributors. Although the statute itself does not specifythese minimum standards, Congress clearly intended that these standardsmatch currently recommended practices within the wholesale drug sector.The recommendation by the House of Representatives' Committee on Energyand Commerce for FDA to consider the Guidelines for the Inspection of Wholesalesissued by the NABP provided explicit guidance on the specifications forthese standards. FDA sought to conform the proposed minimum standards withthe NABP guidelines and NWDA's-related proposed uniform standards by limitingmodifications to conformance with current language and to clarificationsrequired for consistency with existing drug regulations. Thus, the proposedminimum standards are intended to mirror recommended practices alreadyexisting among drug wholesalers. The agency is not aware of the degree to which drug wholesalers complywith the various existing guidelines, but the agency believes that theserepresent the norm of current practices and procedures among drug wholesalers.Thus, the agency expects minimal incremental costs to occur when thesestandards become effective 2 years after the publication of the final rulebased on this proposal. To the extent to which this perception is not correct,any substantial costs that may arise will be attributable to the statuteitself. Thus, this rule is not expected to produce economic consequencesbeyond those contemplated by the act. Accordingly, the agency concludesthat this proposed rulemaking is not a major rule as defined by ExecutiveOrder 12291. For similar reasons, the agency certifies, in accordance withthe Regulatory Flexibility Act, that this proposal will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Proposed Legislation </ITAG>On April 22, 1988, when the President signed the Prescription Drug MarketingAct into law, he issued a statement expressing his support for the goalsof the bill but noting reservations about some of its provisions. Amongthese was the requirement that States adhere to Federal standards whenlicensing wholesale drug distributors. The President said he objected tothis provision because of his commitment to fundamental principles of federalism.The President stated that he had directed the Department of Justice tosubmit to Congress legislation repealing this portion of the new law. ThatDepartment is now in the process of drafting legislation for submissionto Congress that would repeal the requirements (1) that a wholesale distributorbe licensed by the State in accordance with Federal guidelines, and (2)that FDA shall by regulation issue such guidelines establishing minimumstandards, conditions, and terms for State licensing of wholesale drugdistributors. If this legislation is passed by Congress and signed intolaw by the President, this rulemaking will become moot. If such legislationis not passed by Congress or signed into law by the President, this rulemakingwill go forward as required by current law and discussed in this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 </ITAG>Sections 205.7 and 205.50 of this proposed rule contain certain collectionof information requirements. As required by section 3504(h) of the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980, FDA has submitted a copy of this proposed rule tothe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review of these collectionof information requirements. Other organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on thecollection of information requirements should direct them to the DocketsManagement Branch (address above) and to the Office of Information andRegulatory Affairs, OMB, Rm. 3208, New Executive Office Bldg., Washington,DC 20503, Attn: Desk Officer for FDA.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Environmental Impact </ITAG>The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(7), (8), and (10) thatthis action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively havea significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmentalassessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Request for Comments </ITAG>The new law requires the agency to adopt a final rule establishing Statelicensing guidelines not later than 180 days after April 22, 1988, thedate the new legislation was enacted into law. Accordingly, pursuant to21 CFR 10.40(b)(2), the Commissioner of Food and Drugs finds that goodcause exists for shortening the comment period on the proposed rule to30 days. The 180-day deadline cannot be met if a 60-day period is allowedfor comment after the date of publication of the proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Interested persons may, on or before October 13, 1988, submit to the DocketsManagement Branch (address above) written comments regarding this proposal.Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individualsmay submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket numberfound in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments maybe seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Proposed Effective Date </ITAG>FDA proposes that any final rule based on this proposal become effectiveupon publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The new law provides that 2 years after theissuance of the final rule, only drug wholesalers licensed by States whoselaws meet these guidelines will be permitted to distribute prescriptiondrugs in interstate commerce (21 U.S.C. 353(e)(2) (A) and (B)). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 205 </ITAG>Drugs, Labeling, Manufacturing, Warehouses, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.
