The proposed purchase, which is subject to negotiations, could involve as many as 51 helicopters and related systems with a total value of of two billion Canadian dollars ($1.51 billion), Canada's Defense Department said.    The EH-101, which was jointly developed by Westland Group Ltd. of Britain and Agusta S.p.A. of Italy, will be used by the Canadian navy for surveillance and anti-submarine duty.    The Westland-Agusta partnership submitted the bid to the Canadian government in association with several Canadian-based firms, including Bell Helicopter Textron Canada Ltd., a unit of Textron Inc., Providence, R.I.; Paramax Electronics Ltd., a unit of Unisys Corp., Detroit; IMP Group Ltd., Halifax, Nova Scotia; and Canadian Marconi Co., a unit of General Electric Co. of Britain, London.    A rival bid for the contract was made by Aerospatiale, a French government-owned aircraft company, and Canadair Ltd., a unit of Bombardier Inc., Montreal.    Britain's navy has ordered 50 EH-101s, and Italy's navy is expected to order 36. </TEXT></DOC>
