Roberti, D-Los Angeles, is president pro tempore of the state Senate.CommentarySee also related stories on P. 7C of this section  </MEMO><TEXT>     The one brief shining moment came in the 1960s, when leaders and votersapproved the State Water Project.;    If nothing else, the drought shouldbring the warring parties together to talk it out. I am organizing a publicwater policy summit for April 5 in Los Angeles for the private and publicsectors to present proposals, modifications and reforms for California'slong-term water policy.;    I propose this as an agenda:;    (check) Watertrading, banking and pricing. Water trading is an essential field forexperiment. It will take cooperation from the Water Resources Control Board,to ensure that traders' long-term water rights are not confounded, and fromthe environmental interests.;    (check) Conservation. As long as water isinordinately cheap, there is no reason for people to conserve or to trade orsell. But a system of water trading, in which farmers would be sufficientlycompensated to persuade them to voluntarily trade water, would effectivelychange the price of water, and encourage conservation through market forces.;   Some estimates say we use around 40 million acre-feet of water in Californiaeach year. A surcharge of $2.50 per acre-foot would raise $100 million. Itwould add a negligible amount to the cost paid by users of high-cost water. Itwould add a lot to the cost of the most underpriced water in the state, andstimulate interest in conservation.;    (check) State-federal cooperation.California's two massive water systems, the federal Central Valley Project andthe State Water Project, are run under different pricing structures,allocation rules and managements. Rules effectively prohibit using water fromthe larger federal system in Southern California.;    California cannot hopeto have a sensible water management policy so long as the federal system isrun separately and incongruously from state water policy.;    (check)Reservoir Management. Running the reservoirs of a water project is a gamble.There is a trade-off between supplying more water in most years and havingwater in reserve to get you through dry periods.;    The state and Legislatureshould have said &quot;no&quot; to agriculture when it asked to avoid cuts in the lastfive years.;    (check) Natural resources. Fish and wildlife and even plantspecies have claims on water, too. The heart of state water policy is the SanFrancisco Bay estuary; how we solve the bay-delta problem signals theresolution of our water dilemma.;    (check) Groundwater. Groundwater is ourultimate water insurance, the aquatic bank account that can get us through drytimes.;    Many aquifers are contaminated with fuels, solvents or pesticides.They have to be restored, even if it is difficult and expensive. Anotherproblem is unregulated use and overuse of groundwater.;    (check) Growth.California's growing population places additional strain on resources. Do weneed to increase California's net water supply? Changes in the delta may beneeded. More reservoirs may be needed. Better facilities for moving andstoring wet-year water may be needed.; (hbox);    Nothing is forbidden in thisdiscussion about long-term water policy. Everyone must share the pain and theresponsibility.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID A.
