The 0.1 percent rise in non-farm business productivity, outputper hour worked, continued a sawtooth pattern in effect for all oflast year with a strong gain in one quarter followed by a poorshowing in the next quarter.   Productivity had risen at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in thefirst quarter of 1988 only to plunge at a rate of 2.4 percent in thesecond quarter. It then rose at a 2 percent rate in theJuly-September quarter only to slow to the miniscule 0.1 percentadvance in the final three months of the year.   Of particular concern to economists were signs that tight labormarkets and high factory operating rates were beginning to show upin inflationary pressures.   Unit labor costs, which reflect changes in hourly compensation aswell as changes in productivity, rose at an annual rate of 5.6percent in the fourth quarter, almost double the 3.7 percent rate ofincrease in the third quarter.   It was the biggest increase in unit labor costs since a 6.8percent rise in the second quarter last year.   The figures released today represented only slight revisions froman initial productivity report issued a month ago. The 5.6 percentrise in unit labor costs was unchanged from the prior report.   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan cited the sharpescalation of unit labor costs as one factor behind the centralbank's recent anti-inflation moves. The Fed is hoping that bypushing up interest rates it will dampen demand enough to cool anoverheated economy and prevent an inflationary wage-price spiralfrom taking hold.   For the year as a whole, productivity increased 1.4 percent,matching the average annual gain since the end of the 1981-82recession.   While the increase was up slightly from a 0.8 percent rise in1987, it was still far below the 2 percent annual gains the Bushadministration is counting on in future years to shrink the $170billion budget deficit to zero by 1993.   Meeting the Bush targets for productivity is considered essentialto reaching the administration's optimistic projections for overallgrowth of the economy without triggering higher inflation rates.</TEXT></DOC>
