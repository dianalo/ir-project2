The intelligent assistance component of USCSH is capable of respondingto user queries posed in natural language. An ATN-based natural languageinterface has been implemented for this purpose. This paper demonstrateshow the ATN framework can be used to embed domain-specific semantic informationinto the parsing process without sacrificing the generality of the parser.The advantage of incorporating semantic processing in the syntactic analysisphase is that it makes the subsequent processing of queries more efficient.They also show the actions attached to the arcs of the ATN can be generalizedto incorporate the ability to examine conditions, make decisions andexecute entire procedures. Finally, this research presents techniquesto show that the ATN can be used for parsing both grammatical and ungrammaticalinput, even though it has traditionally been employed as a syntax-orientedmachine. The ATN can thus be seen to provide a unified representationfor both syntactic and semantic processing of natural language, and thisconforms to the human language understanding process.</TEXT></DOC>
