<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-49-1086 </DOCNO><TEXT>BTU content, moisture content, carbon content, cellulose content, color,and reflectance have all been used to some degree in defining the boundarybetween peat and lignite; yet, most authors have been noticeably vaguein their use of these parameters. Two reasons for this vagueness maybe 1) the lack of comparable data on peats and lignites and 2) the overlappingof measured values between materials that are presently accepted as peatsand those that are presently considered lignites. The ASTM Classificationof Coals by Rank, for example, defines the lower limit of lignite at6300 BTU/lb (MMMF); yet, naturally-occurring peats may have BTU valuesexceeding this value. Overlapping values have also been measured forcarbon content, color, and even reflectance. Comparisons of these measurementsmay be further complicated by uncertainty as to which ingredients inpeats are comparable to those in lignites. Another complicating factoris that different peat constituents can change at different times duringearly stages of coalification. The transformation from peat to ligniteis, thus, a somewhat erratic process in which ingredients are changingat different times and different rates depending on such factors as 1)original chemical composition, 2) water chemistry, and 3) biologicalprocesses, with variability in these factors being on a microenvironmentalscale.</TEXT></DOC>
