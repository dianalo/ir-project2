The 12-nation trading bloc said in a statement Coca-Cola ExportCorp.-Filiale Italiana, known as Export Italia, agreed to changeits discount program retroactive to Jan. 1.   The agreement, it said, ``opens the way for normal conditions ofcompetition to develop on the Italian cola drinks market.''   ``However,'' it said, ``the (EEC) will be particularly vigilantin the future and will not fail to act against any agreement orpractice which infringes EEC competition rules.''   The community said the Italian company San Pellegrino filed acomplaint in September 1987 against Export Italia's discountprogram.   ``Export Italia concluded agreements with many largedistribution companies,'' the statement said. ``It would grant arebate to distributors selling only Coca-Cola.''   ``The amount of these rebates was fixed individually for eachproducer,'' it said. ``The agreements often provided clausesextending the exclusivity to other soft drinks.''   The EEC said it conducted a preliminary investigation of thecomplaint and found that Export Italia ``enjoys a dominant positionon the Italian cola market.''   It said the so-called fidelity rebate program violated EEC rulesbecause ``it encourages the distributors to sell only Coca-Colaand, therefore, prevents or hinders competing producers fromentering the Italian colas market.''   It found other rebate programs offered by the company alsoviolated EEC rules, it said. These included offering discounts ifdistributors met certain targets that were based on the previousyear's volume.   But it said the EEC did not object to rebates which were basedon buying various sizes of the same product, resupplying shelves orusing advertising materials.</TEXT></DOC>
