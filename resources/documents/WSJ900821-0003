The two had sought a meeting of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries to endorse a plan under whichthey and other producers would increase output to avoid oilshortages and runaway prices during the current Middle Eastcrisis.</LP><TEXT>   The rejection of their bid was widely thought to mean thatSaudi Arabia will soon produce more oil anyway. The kingdomhad previously stated that it would do so if OPEC failed toact. Venezuela is expected to follow suit.   A statement issued by OPEC's Vienna headquarters yesterdaysaid the request for a special meeting failed to get therequired support of a majority of OPEC's 13 member nations.The statement added that Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oilminister and OPEC president, would &quot;meet some OPEC oilministers for consultations before the end of the month.&quot;   Despite the decision against an emergency session, bothSaudi Arabia and Venezuela still held out hope for some sortof OPEC meeting quickly to consider their intention toreplace more than half the four million barrels a day ofIraqi and Kuwaiti crudes lost to world oil markets. Also,some others in OPEC who had voted against an immediateemergency meeting appeared to be having second thoughts.   Last night, several oil ministers were trying to arrangeat least such an informal meeting, possibly by Friday. Theirgoal is to provide some kind of OPEC &quot;umbrella&quot; for theincreased output, mainly to avoid the appearance of aproduction free-for-all.   &quot;The potential for a meeting of some sort, by at least sixor seven, is still there,&quot; said Bahman Karbassioun, aVienna-based consultant and former OPEC official. The ideawould be to &quot;use OPEC's good offices&quot; for the productionincreases that are going to happen anyway &quot;and not damage theorganization,&quot; he said.   In Caracas, meanwhile, Venezuelan President Carlos AndresPerez was quoted by the government news agency as saying thatseveral OPEC nations with the potential to increase oilproduction expect to meet in the next few days. And he saidVenezuela will increase its production &quot;when there is anaccord within OPEC.&quot;   There wasn't any immediate official response from SaudiArabia to the rejection of the call for an emergency meeting.But one Persian Gulf oil official close to developmentssuggested that OPEC's &quot;saying `no' to a conference meanssaying `yes' to the idea that everybody can act on his own.&quot;   Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, had made clearover the weekend that the kingdom, which has been producingwithin its OPEC quota of 5.4 million barrels a day, wouldshortly increase output by as much as two million barrels aday with or without OPEC's approval. Among other reasons, Mr.Nazer cited the damage to the economies of developingcountries from escalating oil prices. And he suggestedVenezuela and the United Arab Emirates would produce anadditional 500,000 barrels a day each, and urged others withlesser spare capacity to help make up the lost four millionbarrels a day.   Yesterday, President Bush applauded the Saudi decision.White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, &quot;The presidentnotes that we are very pleased by the boost in world-widesupply being provided by Saudi Arabia, and overall we believewe have reasonably stable conditions with regard to oilproduction and supply.&quot;   Oil prices, which have gained as much as $8 a barrel sincethe Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, had been expected tolevel out this week on the basis of the Saudi public pledgeto increase production. Yesterday, crudes generally werehigher though the rate of climb did slow. Petroleum productprices rose sharply as market worries centered on possiblytighter fuel supplies. On the New York Mercantile Exchange,unleaded gasoline for September delivery surged 4.28 cents tosettle at $1 a gallon.   Several OPEC nations remain strongly opposed to any changethat would pour more oil onto world markets at this time.Iraq is among them. It vociferously objects to any OPECmeeting designed to replace its blockaded oil. And its oldwar foe Iran also is opposed to such a meeting.   Iran's oil revenues have increased sharply since Iraqinvaded Kuwait, and Iran not only has sold most of the oil ithad sitting in storage, but has received substantially higherprices for the oil. Meanwhile, it is winning new customers onlong-term contracts in Japan who formerly purchased fromIraq.   There are also several members of OPEC who maintain thatthere isn't any need to increase production while oilinventories, including government-stored crudes in majorconsuming nations, remain high. Indonesia, usually a moderateon oil prices, proposes that OPEC's ministerialmarket-monitoring groups carefully study the supply anddemand situation before considering a full meeting.   Meanwhile, a meeting of the governing board of theInternational Energy Agency that had been scheduled forThursday has been postponed until Aug. 31. The delegates tothe Paris-based agency are to consider the consuming nations'possible responses to the oil-supply crunch. The governingboard first met earlier this month but concluded then thatconditions didn't warrant the use of the emergencyoil-sharing system or drawdowns of strategic oil stores.</TEXT></DOC>
