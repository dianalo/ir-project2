However, actual rain hasa higher acidity in most cases and the causative substances are almostexclusively SO{sub 2} and NOx. The pH averaged over 100 points acrossJapan is 4.5, and it is also between 4 and 5 in Tokyo. In some urbanareas, there are sources of alkaline substances that serve for neutralization.The value of PH was in the range from 4.0 to 5.0 in Europe from 1978to 1982, while the yearly average of PH is 4.2 - 5.0 in areas rangingfrom the south side of the U.S's Great Lakes to southeastern Canada.A wide variety of factors including substances of natural origins shouldbe taken into account in investigating the acidification of rain.
