The market fought back from an early decline to reach narrowly mixed levels late in the session, but the recovery attempt collapsed as sellers emerged near the close.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which reached its best level since last October's market crash three times last week, finished near its session lows by falling 13.16 to 2170.34. The slide was exacerbated by weakness in oil stocks, which are well represented in the average.    Among broader market averages, the declines were less severe. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index fell 1.38 to 282.28, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index dipped 0.86 to 265.27 and the New York Stock Exchange Index eased 0.57 to 158.85.    Even when the indexes recovered lost ground in the final hour, however, the overall market failed to follow suit. Some 866 issues were lower in price on the Big Board at the close, while 596 advanced.    Tomorrow's scheduled release of data on third-quarter gross national product kept some participants away from the market, traders said. About 170.6 million shares changed hands on the Big Board, compared with 195.4 million Friday.    Bill Langevin, manager of institutional trading at Morgan, Keegan andamp; Co., Memphis, Tenn., said that while institutional activity was light yesterday, &quot;last week confirmed that cash is ready to go to work.&quot; The Dow Jones industrials ended the week at 2183.50, their post-crash high, amid unusually active trading.    Should the GNP report serve to confirm recent evidence that the economy's growth is slowing, Mr. Langevin said, some of that cash will probably find its way into stocks.    Ralph J. Acampora, head of technical research at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., said that while he expects the Dow Jones industrials to move past the 2200 level soon, the market's advance from current levels is likely to be &quot;trudging all the way.&quot;    Calling its recent advance &quot;labored&quot; and &quot;very, very selective,&quot; Mr. Acampora said he sees market psychology as the primary barrier to any escape from its year-old trading range. &quot;Unless you really get some bullish, bullish sentiment, you'll just maintain the same type of action,&quot; he said.    He also suggested that the recent rash of takeovers won't have any lasting impact on the market. &quot;You take them out of the way, and what do you really have?&quot; he asked.    Not much, said Robert L. Kahan, manager of equity trading at Montgomery Securities, San Francisco. &quot;It's a deal market. The stocks that are in play are the stocks where the action is,&quot; he said.    Suresh L. Bhirud, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., said a two-tier market has developed recently, with takeover stocks rallying and other issues, especially technology and economically sensitive stocks, remaining stuck in a downward trend that has prevailed since April.    Mr. Bhirud said the current round of mergers, acquisitions and restructurings should hold any downturns in stocks to a minimum but that investors' fears about the economy could return to haunt the market if the GNP report doesn't live up to expectations. &quot;I think the market wants to believe that the economy is weak, but in reality the economy will show a reasonably good growth pattern,&quot; he said.    &quot;The market will have difficulty in making progress if a strong economy continues to put pressure on inflation. Then the market is going to have to start worrying about the implications for interest rates after the election,&quot; Mr. Bhirud said, referring to the possibility that the Federal Reserve could act to push rates higher.    On the takeover front, RJR Nabisco surged 7 1/4 to 84. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts said it plans to offer cash and securities valued at $90 a share, or more than $20 billion, for the company in a leveraged buyout. Last week, a management group said it intends to propose a buy-out for about $75 a share in cash. RJR was the most active Big Board issue, as 10.8 million shares changed hands in composite trading.    Kraft, which is planning a recapitalization aimed at thwarting a takeover attempt by Philip Morris, soared 10 to 102 on composite volume of 7.8 million shares. The company puts a value of $110 a share on its plan, including a special dividend of $84 in cash and bonds valued at $14 a share. Philip Morris, which is bidding $90 a share, rose 1/8 to 97 1/2; the company went to court in an effort to block Kraft from carrying out its plan or selling any assets.    Chicago Pacific jumped 13 1/4 to 56 5/8 as Maytag agreed to acquire the company for about $1 billion. The accord calls for Maytag to pay $60 a share in cash for 49% of the company's common stock, and swap stock worth $60 a share for the rest. Maytag dropped 2 3/4 to 23 3/4.    West Point-Pepperell climbed 4 3/4 to 50, well above investor William Farley's offer of $48 a share, in composite trading of 2.9 million shares. Mr. Farley said he plans to sell Pepperell's apparel, apparel fabrics and industrial fabrics businesses if his bid is successful.    Digital Equipment, which has dropped 4 1/8 points Friday following a disappointing earnings report, rebounded 3 to 90. Rumors of a possible takeover bid from American Telephone andamp; Telegraph contributed to the rise, traders told the Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Digital noted that the rumors have surfaced a number of times in the past; it declined further comment.    Oil stocks dropped along with oil prices.    Exxon fell 5/8 to 45 1/2, Chevron went down 5/8 to 46 3/8, Du Pont dipped 1 1/2 to 83 3/8, Mobil eased 5/8 to 45 5/8 and Amoco skidded 1 1/2 to 74 3/8. On the other hand, NWA gained 1 1/4 to 53 1/4 as a result of the oil-price decline and its report that third-quarter net income rose to $3.98 a share from $2.89 a year earlier. Other airline stocks moved higher as well.    Federal Express dropped 2 1/2 to 48 1/4.    United Parcel Service, a major competitor, is cutting prices for its air freight service and introducing volume discounts for the first time.    Marion Laboratories rose 1 1/8 to 19 7/8 on composite volume of two million shares after a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee agreed to consider its request for approval of a new form of Cardizem, its leading drug. Both the company and analysts expect a favorable recommendation.    The American Stock Exchange Index dropped 1.12 to 304.95. Volume totaled 9,010,000 shares.    Forstmann andamp; Co. slid 1 7/8 to 9 1/8. The company said a special committee of its board is talking with several parties regarding a sale of all or part of the company.    Maxxam Group lost 3/8 to 22 5/8. The Wall Street Journal reported that four former shareholders of Pacific Lumber filed a $2.25 billion lawsuit seeking to invalidate Maxxam's 1985 acquisition of the company.    United Medical added 7/8 to 5 1/8 after it reported net income from continuing operations of $491,000, compared with a loss from continuing operations last year of $1.8 million.    A poor earnings report sent Barrister Information Systems down 3/8 to 2 1/2. The company reported a loss of $1.5 million, compared with net income of $366,000 a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
