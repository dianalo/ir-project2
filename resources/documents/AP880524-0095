PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Communist Party will consider at a Juneconference a proposal to limi party officials to two five-yearterms, but it is uncertain whether the change would apply togeneral secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a top official said today.   ``This is a big step in the development of intrapartydemocracy,'' Karl Vayno, party leader of the Estonian republic,said in an interview with Western correspondents.   Current terms for party jobs are unlimited, and longevity is oneof the key ways Communist Party officials build their personalpower and maintain privileges in their city, region or at thenational level.   Vayno, one of the more than 300 members of the policy-makingCentral Committee, discussed the committee's meeting Monday duringa break in a session of the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominalparliament.   The Central Committee discussed and approved the party'sblueprint for the June 28 special party conference, which otherofficials say is shaping up as a show-down between backers ofGorbachev seeking radical changes in the Communist Party and thosewho want limited changes.   Other officials have said earlier that limits on terms of officewould be considered at the party conference, but Vayno providedmore detail on the proposal after it had been accepted by theCentral Committee for discussion.   One proposal is to limit all elected party leaders, from citiesand local regions all the way to the ruling Politburo, to twofive-year terms, Vayno said.   But he said there were other proposals to exclude certain partyjobs, including Gorbachev's, from the limitations. He said it wasuncertain what the conference would decide.   Asked his personal view, he said it ``depends on thepersonality.''   ``If the vote is about Gorbachev, I would vote with both handsto exclude him,'' Vayno said.   Gorbachev has urged the Commuunist Party to adopt means ofensuring turnover in top party positions, and asked by theWashington Post in an interview last week whether he supportedlimited terms of office he answered ``yes,'' but did not elaborate.   The Central Committee also agreed to place reforms in theelectoral system for government positions before the partyconference, Vayno said. He did not elaborate.</TEXT></DOC>
