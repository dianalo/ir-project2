There is no word on McCarthy's welfare and no group has claimedresponsibility for his kidnapping.   ``We think constantly of the long years you have spent in Beirutand hope that 1990 will see you safely back home,'' McCarthy'sfather, Patrick, wrote in a message.   McCarthy's girlfriend, Jill Morrell, wrote: ```No one hasforgotten you for a second. I long to know how you are and what youare thinking, but the longer this goes on the more determined I amto see you back home. Hang on and do not lose hope.''   Several newspapers, radio and television stations in Beirut areplanning to broadcast or print the messages that friends andrelatives hope McCarthy will be permitted to hear or read.   McCarthy, 33, was kidnapped April 17, 1986, while driving toBeirut airport to catch a flight to London. He was working for theLondon-based Worldwide Television News.   In London, a noon church service and a silent vigil outside theIranian Embassy were planned to mark his abduction.   Despite repeated appeals from his family, published in Beirutnewspapers, little is known about McCarthy's kidnappers.   McCarthy's mother, Sheila, died of cancer at age 66 on July 9,1989. A month before her death she appealed to her son's abductorsto let her see him before she passed away. She received no responseand it is unclear if McCarthy is aware of his mother's death.   Appeals from the British government, the InternationalFederation of Journalists and the United Nations Education,Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) have also failed todraw any response from the kidnappers.   Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin, spiritual head of Lebanon'sShiite Moslem community, said recently that all Western hostageskidnapped in Beirut were alive and well. He did not expand on thestatement.   Shiite extremists loyal to Iran are believed to hold most of the18 Western hostages in Lebanon. Most have been captives for morethan three years.   Longest-held is American journalist Terry A. Anderson, 42, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was abductedMarch 16, 1985.   The 18 hostages include eight Americans, four Britons, twoSwiss, two West Germans, an Irishman and an Italian.</TEXT></DOC>
