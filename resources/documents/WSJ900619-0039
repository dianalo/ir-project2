Such machines, dubbed note-pad computers, are being toutedas the next big thing in computing, because they would allowpeople who are intimidated by technology to write with apenlike instrument on a computer screen, which can be aneasier way to communicate than typing strings of complicatedcommands.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, lightweight, portable note-pad computerswould open up new applications -- inventory-taking, forexample, or use by salespeople, secretaries and journalists.   Several note-pad computers are already being marketed,most notably by Tandy Corp.'s Grid Systems unit. But theseearly stabs at handwriting recognition require users to printclearly and to leave adequate spacing between letters. IBMsaid its advance, which it presented at an industryconference in Atlantic City, N.J., points the way towardeliminating these restrictions.   &quot;This is another nice step in a continual progression tothe point where a computer can recognize whatever you slapdown on its screen,&quot; said Vern Raburn, chairman of SlateCorp., a Scottsdale, Ariz., company developing software fornote-pad computers.</TEXT></DOC>
