The ITC, on a 3-3 vote, ruled yesterday that the imports are injuring domestic manufacturers. That was the final step in U.S. consideration of trade complaints that Bethlehem Steel Corp. filed against the imports last year on behalf of U.S. steel producers. An ITC spokesman said that in such cases, a tie vote results in the imposition of penalties.    Earlier, the Commerce Department ruled that some of the imports were being &quot;dumped&quot; -- that is, sold in the U.S. at prices below the cost of production or the prices in the home market. The department also found they were being subsidized by the Canadian government, making them subject to U.S. countervailing duties in addition to the anti-dumping duties.    The department said that Algoma Steel Corp. and other Canadian producers have sold steel rails to U.S. railroads, subway systems and other buyers at prices averaging 38.79% below &quot;fair value.&quot; Such &quot;dumping margins&quot; will be the amount of extra import duties to be assessed on the imports.    An ITC official said extra tariffs will be collected on new steel rails supplied by Sydney Steel Corp. to offset Canadian government subsidies. The Commerce Department concluded earlier that Algoma Steel should be excluded from the countervailing-duty case because its estimated subsidies have amounted to only about 0.24% of the price of its rail exports.    According to the ITC, steel-rail imports from Canada totaled about $10.7 million in 1987 and increased to more than $12 million in 1988. The Commerce Department had indicated that the imports totaled more than that, but its figures included imports of other products that weren't covered in the two steel-rail trade cases. </TEXT></DOC>
