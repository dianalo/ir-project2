(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cities and states should look to tolls,fees and lotteries to finance roads and bridges because of thefederal government's budget problems, Transportation SecretarySamuel Skinner told mayors today.   Skinner told the U.S. Conference of Mayors that local governmentscan no longer count on Washington for most of its transportationinvestments.   He said lotteries, toll roads and bridges, user fees and feescharged to developers are ``new, creative ways'' that state andlocal governments are turning to.   Skinner said federal transportation grants will increasingly beawarded to areas that offer to put up more local money than the 20percent or 25 percent many federal programs require.   ``If you don't have 50 percent or better state and localparticipation ... that grant will be so far down the priority listit will not be reached,'' he said.   On Monday, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp toldthe mayors he had taken partisanship out of funding decisions at hisscandal-ridden department.   ``Democrats and Republicans need to read my lips _ it's open toeverybody on the basis of need as opposed to greed, as it existed inthe past,'' Kemp told the U.S. Conference of Mayors on Monday.   ``I will clean it up. I will clean it out.''   The more than 200 mayors from both parties were continuing theirfive-day meeting today, with appearances by more Bush administrationofficials and Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown. The conferenceconcludes Wednesday.   Environmental Protection Agency chief William K. Reilly also wasscheduled to appear today.   In prepared remarks, Reilly urged support for President Bush'sclean air act proposal and said merely offering it was ``an act ofgreat political courage.''   ``The president is walking head-on into one of our thorniestpolitical briar patches,'' Reilly said.   Bush's proposal is aimed at breaking a decade-long congressionalstalemate that has blocked enactment of tougher federal clean airlaws. It calls for a 50 percent, 10 million ton reduction in sulfurdioxide emissions, a chief cause of acid rain, from coal burningpower plants. Other measures are aimed at smog and ozone problems,including a phase-in of cars powered by methanol.   The proposal marks a break from the Reagan administration, whichdid not acknowledge acid rain as an environmental concern andopposed tougher laws to curb smog.   Kemp was greeted warmly, in contrast to an earlier appearance byRepublican National Chairman Lee Atwater. Atwater's sharply partisanremarks, including his pledge to work actively for GOP mayoralcandidates and reference to the mayors as the ``farm team'' of theparty, drew complaints from mayors in both parties.   Kemp repeated his recent promise to crack down on mismanagementand fraud in the department and eliminate political influence fromdecision-making on federal grants. HUD has been beset by a series ofscandals, including the embezzlement of millions of dollars andcharges that well-connected Republicans used influence peddling tosteer the awarding of HUD grants.   He said reforms would not interfere with his goals, includingestablishing urban enterprise zones that are aimed at luring jobs tothe ghettos, allowing public housing tenants to manage and purchasetheir residences, and fighting drugs.   Kemp declined, however, to say whether former HUD SecretarySamuel Pierce, who served throughout the Reagan administration, mustshoulder blame for the problems being uncovered.   ``I'm not going to make a political judgment about any pastsecretary because I think it's unseemly of me,'' he said.   Kemp said he was ``confident I understand the scope'' of thescandals at HUD.   ``I don't think it's as bad as the critics say. I don't thinkit's as good as I want it to be,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
