The mud-and-straw house was given to her by a volunteerorganization that works for the poor.   ``Where shall I get the money?'' asked Noorjahan, a 35-year-oldwidow who lived with her three children in Nirala, a small villagenear Manikganj.   Like many of the 130,000 people left homeless by the April 26tornado, Noorjahan and her children are living outdoors andsurviving on government-supplied food.   The twister slashed through 40 villages, destroying at least30,000 houses and injuring about 12,000 people.   Some are suffering from gangrene, and doctors estimate at least500 people will have to have arms or legs amputated because ofgangrene.   Ahsanullah, 45, who is well-off by local standards, said he soldone of his two cows for about $144 to rebuild his tin-roofed,wooden house in Tilli village.   The government plan to build 2,400 houses and the non-governmentvoluntary organizations have promished to construct 4,000 houses.   Officials at the Relief Ministry said Friday that more than1,100 people died in the tornado.   ``We are certain that more that 1,100 people perished in thetornado,'' said one official, speaking on condition of anonymnity.   He said the 400 people listed as missing are now reported to bedead. Among those are 200 fishermen who were in their boats whenthe tornado hit about 25 miles northwest of Dhaka.   The storm also left lingering health problems, because waterfacilities were destroyed by the storm and people have beendrinking polluted water.   Manikganj doctors said they had treated at least 500 people fordiarrhea in the last five days and two had already died.   Bangladesh is plagued by a cycle of natural disasters thatincludes floods, drought, cyclones and tornadoes. The low-lyingnation of 110 million people, most of it barely above sea level,has an average annual income of $160.   Last summer, floods killed 1,400 people and left 2.5 millionhomeless. A cyclone in November claimed 1,100 lives.   In Ashkali village near Manikganj, Ashraf Ali sat in the ruinsof his house.   ``Look, there was a house here. There was a happy home. Now Ihave nothing, nothing but an uncertain future,'' said Ali, 65.   His wife, two daughters and grandson died in the tornado.   ``There they are, sleeping in peace,'' he said, pointing to amass grave. ``I need to join them.''</TEXT></DOC>
