The generic drug holding company, whose subsidiaries arePar Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Quad Pharmaceuticals Inc., saidnone of the products for which withdrawals are beingrequested are currently being made or marketed by eitherunit. Most of the products haven't been made or marketed formore than 18 months. Par said it would recall three productsfor which it ceased distribution earlier this year, but thatwouldn't have a material effect on its financial results.</LP><TEXT>   The action followed a recent announcement by the FDA thatit plans to make a validity assessment of companies that havebeen implicated with fraud, Kenneth I. Sawyer, PharmaceuticalResources president and chief executive officer, said. TheFDA found in 1989 that Par, the predecessor to PharmaceuticalResources, submitted false and misleading information innew-drug filings with the agency, and former companyofficials were convicted of making illegal payments to FDAemployees. The company said the FDA won't approve any newabbreviated applications or most supplements to existing onesuntil the assessments are completed. Par was one of severalgeneric companies implicated in a continuing federalinvestigation of fraudulent generic-drug applications.   Mr. Sawyer said the company decided to seek thewithdrawals because its own audits found that data orrepresentations submitted in support of the applications wereinaccurate or inadequate.</TEXT></DOC>
