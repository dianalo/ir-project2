(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jin Di has been on an odyssey of his ownsince fellow scholars in China asked him 10 years ago to do theseemingly impossible: translate James Joyce's ``Ulysses'' intoChinese.   With few Joyce scholars or books in his country to guide him,Jin has used his wanderings outside China and correspondence withan expert at Yale to learn enough about the novel to begin totranslate it into his native tongue.   After a year as a senior research fellow at the University ofNotre Dame, the 67-year-old teacher of translation theory can nowbe found hunched over material from the James Joyce collection atYale's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.   He has been studying various translations to see how others inhis field dealt with the almost scientific precision Joyce used intelling the story of advertisement-canvassser Leopold Bloom.   Jin's translation of about a fifth of the work into Chinese waspublished three years ago, and a publishing house in Beijing hasagreed to publish his translation of selected portions from alittle more than half of ``Ulysses'' in 1990.   Jin aspires to translate the entire book, but said ``muchdepends on what I can do here.''   ``There are no Joyceans in China, so if there are any questions,I have nobody to discuss them with,'' Jin said one recent morning.   He will spend a semester at the University of Virginia after histwo-month fellowship ends here at the end of May, and then returnto the Foreign Languages Institute in Tianjin, where he has been aprofessor since 1977.   It was in 1979 that people at the Tianjin Academy of SocialSciences asked him to attempt the translation.   ``They thought it was outrageous this book which was so famousin the West was not at all known in China,'' he said.   ``Nobody had dared approach it _ both the translation and thereading. Linguistically, it was almost impossible, and thesociopolitical atmosphere had almost killed the possibility of itbeing translated into Chinese,'' he said.   Jin said he hesitated when he received the request.   ``I didn't even know what Western scholars had been doing sincethe Second World War. It was all a blank to us. China had beenclosed to the West for 30 years,'' he said.   He had read the work only once before _ in 1945 _ when someonehe knew lent him a copy for a week.   ``I ended with some admiration of the great art of which I hadsome glimpses, but I did not really understand what was in it,'' hesaid.   Jin started with one of the easier sections to translate, thesecond episode, in which Stephen Dedalus, the hero of Joyce's firstfull-length novel, ``A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,'' canbe found teaching a class in Roman history.   Jin said he was at the point of abandoning the project when hemet Mary T. Reynolds, a Joyce scholar whose husband, a Yaleeconomics professor, was lecturing at a Chinese university. Withher advice, encouragement and books, Jin continued his project withrenewed vigor.   ``Ulysses,'' which Joyce wrote from 1914 through 1921 afterhaving left his native Dublin, has been translated in its entiretyinto Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Japanese,Latvian, Spanish and Swedish. Portions have been translated intoGreek, Italian and Russian.   Jin hopes to give his compatriots the same opportunity to enjoy``Ulysses,'' which is the record of a single day, June 16, 1904, inand around Dublin.   ``It's really a pity that a fifth of the world cannot read thismasterpiece.''</TEXT></DOC>
