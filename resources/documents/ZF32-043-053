 A file half as long will take half as long to transmit.andP;  Ofcourse, you'll only send half as much data, but that need not be a penalty.andO;By eliminating redundant information from inside, some kinds of files can becompressed to a fraction of their size.andP;  Like dehydrated soup, the vitalcontents can be more easily stored and reconstituted when needed.andM;Some modems have built-in automatic compression abilities.andP;  MNP-5 and V.42bisare two such examples of compression schemes.andM;Compressing files before sending them to your modem, rather than depending ona modem's internal compression, has a big advantage.andP;  Aside from stretchingyour storage resources, compression prior to sending trims your file-transfertime.andM;File compression works because most programs save files in a form that's easyto use, rather than the one that's most economical with file size anddisk-storage space.andP;  The worst offenders are spreadsheets that sometimes savezillions of empty cells in addition to the half dozen filled with data.andP;  Textand graphics applications waste space, too.andP;  For example, the letters of thealphabet, capitals and lowercase--even with punctuation marks and numbersthrown in--use less than half the possibilities of an 8-bit digital code.andO;Two letters (or more) can easily be stored in a single byte, which mostprograms use for each text character.andP;  Bitmapped graphics, with large areasof continuous tone, waste even more storage resources with redundantinformation.andM;File compression has become standard in places where storage space is at apremium, and time for transferring data must be minimized.andP;  Electronicbulletin boards almost universally deal in archives, files compressed one wayor another to take best advantage of their resources.andM;Understandably, then, most archival data-compression products began asshareware products--distributed through bulletin boards, advertised onlythrough word of mouth, free to try but requiring a modest licensing fee forcontinuing (and commercial) use.andM;As others beyond bulletin-board operators and their users have discovered theusefulness of file-compression programs, commercial vendors have joined thelist of suppliers, both tailoring compression for special applications andjoining the mainstream with archiving utilities that pack data as tightly aspossible.andM;The first program to win wide acceptance for file compression and archivingamong bulletin-board operators was ARC from System Enhancement Associates(SEA).andP;  Since its introduction in 1985, ARC has been revised a number oftimes and has been distributed as shareware.andP;  That is, you can download andtry the program for free, but continued use requires payment of aregistration fee, which generally brings a comprehensive manual and a mostrecent upgrade.andP;  Shareware programs are not in the public domain and may notbe freely copied except under their own licensing terms.andM;ARC uses two forms of compression: repeated-character and dynamic Lempel-Zivcompression.andP;  The program itself picks the most effective of the two.andP;  Filescompressed using ARC are distinguished by their use of the filenameextension.andM;Many bulletin boards have abandoned ARC file compression for a competingproduct, PKZip from PKware Inc.andP;  Reasons vary.andP;  Some people did not likeSEA's aggressive use of the legal system against PKware.andP;  Others found PKZipto be faster, more efficient, and more versatile in file compression.andP;  (ARCand PKZip vigorously compete against one another, each trying to outdo therival in speed and compression efficiency.)andP;  As ARC, PKZip is distributed asshareware.andM;Both of these products are so comprehensive that they've left little room onthe market for commercially distributed (as opposed to shareware)file-compression programs, although if you look hard, you can find some.andO;Their principal competition comes from programs even more liberal in theirlicensing terms--freeware.andM;Two such programs that have found acceptance among bulletin-board operatorsare LHARC and ZOO.andP;  (While you are free to use these programs individually,the commercial use of these utilities is shrouded with doubt because today'scopyright law protects even those creative works that lack a formal copyrightnotice.)andP;  LHARC was written by Haruyasu Yoshizaki and Zoo was written byRahul Dhesi.andP;  These programs are usually available on the electronic bulletinboards that use them for file archiving and may even be available from thosethat don't.andP;  They are not commercially distributed.andM;All of these compression and archiving programs differ in the algorithms theyuse for streamlining data, whimsically identifying their particulartechniques as crunching, squashing, compressing, squeezing, imploding, anddistilling, almost anything short of transmogrification (and that may appearat any time).andP;  Necessarily, they yield different file formats.andP;  Although someare compatible with the formats used by others, you have no guarantee thatone compression program can decompress a file packed by another.andP;  In otherwords, if you plan to exchange compressed files, the sender and recipientwill need to use the same or an explicitly compatible program.andM;All of these applications allow multiple files to be grouped together in asingle archive file and provide utilities (or options) for checking whichfile is in what archive.andM;One word of warning.andP;  Once a file is compressed, it usually cannot becompressed further.andP;  Consequently, modems with built-in filecompression--such as those that follow the MNP-5 or V.42bis standards--won'tbe able to further compress such files.andP;  In fact, sometimes MNP-5 takeslonger to transmit a compressed file than it would take to send the filewithout using MNP-5 compression.andP;  Software compression programs are, thus, analternative rather than a supplement to hardware data compression in modems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
