But the typical personal computer lacks sufficient diskstorage space to hold vast amounts of material, such as thecontents of a year's newspapers or lists of all thebusinesses in a state.   A new kind of computer disk, identical in appearance toaudio compact disks, brings that kind of storage and searchcapability to PCs. Each of these disks, clumsily calledCD-ROMs (for compact disk-read only memory), can hold over600 megabytes of information. That's enough to store thecontents of an entire encyclopedia, including pictures, or ayear's worth of the Congressional Record, or millions oftelephone listings. You can't store your own data on thesedisks, but they hold huge quantities of reference material.   Special software allows users to search through the disksfor topics or items they need. Once retrieved, the results ofthese searches -- say, a recent newspaper article on Boliviancurrency, or a list of businesses in your state selling wingnuts -- can be saved to your hard disk or printed out, orexcerpted in something you're writing.   CD-ROMs have been around for several years. But only inthe past year or so has the price of the special disk drivesneeded to read them come down enough -- and the informationavailable on them become varied enough -- to make them apractical purchase for owners of IBM-compatible or Macintoshpersonal computers. Many of the disks remain pricey, butthey're getting cheaper, and some are real bargains.   Today, a careful shopper can buy major-brand CD-ROM drivesfor $600 or less, a price that often includes software. Atypical offering is Sony's Laser Library, which features aspeedy, rugged, free-standing drive that connects easily toIBM-compatible computers. It also comes with six disks,including Compton's Family Encyclopedia, an atlas, andMicrosoft's Bookshelf of popular reference works, includingan almanac, book of quotations and compact encyclopedia.   DAK Industries, the mail-order electronics firm, offers aSony-built free-standing drive with just the MicrosoftBookshelf disk for $399. Radio Shack has a new CD-ROM drivefor $399, without software, for mounting in your computer.   But the real attraction is in the software, the data beingoffered on CD-ROM disks. For instance, a small outfit calledDeLorme Mapping offers a CD-ROM with a national street atlasfor $99. The disk, Street Atlas USA, allows users to zoom inon any street or block or neighborhood and then print out amap of the area.   Another small firm, Phonedisc USA, offers two CD-ROMs withnationwide residential phone and address listings for about$1,000 each. Dataware publishes SpeedDial, a $299 disk thatcontains nine million business telephone listings from aroundthe country.   UMI, in Ann Arbor, Mich., offers disks containing threeyears of the complete text of many newspapers, including thisone, for $1,000 to $2,500 a disk.   A good way to get a feel for CD-ROM is to contact theBureau of Electronic Publishing in Parsippany, N.J., a majorvendor of CD-ROM software and hardware. The company's catalogincludes articles that explain the technology and compareproducts.   Some notes of caution: As with other new technologies, thecomputer industry has managed to confuse people aboutCD-ROMs. There are two similar technologies, called CD-I andCDTV, which aren't meant for computers, but work instand-alone players as adjuncts to Tv sets. Still anothertechnology is Sony's Data Discman, a handheld machine thatuses smaller disks.   Also, be wary about pitches for &quot;multimedia&quot; CD-ROMs,which play sound, moving pictures and text. This is anexciting technology, but so far there isn't much softwarethat takes advantage of it, and most IBM-compatibles (but notMacs) must be upgraded with sound capability to use it.   Microsoft, which is pushing multimedia hard, offers amultimedia version of the Bookshelf reference software, and adisk called Multimedia Beethoven that plays and analyzes hisNinth Symphony. The company also says it will sell a CD-ROMversion of its integrated Works program with audio animatedtutorials.   To get ready for such disks, you might want to buy a drivethat meets Microsoft's technical specifications formultimedia. But some multimedia-compatible drives, such asRadio Shack's, are relatively slow at &quot;access&quot; speed -- ameasure of how fast the drive can search through data. Forheavy-duty database work, try to get a drive with an accessspeed of 500 milliseconds or better. But don't go overboardon speed: Small differences won't be noticed by most people.   Another caution: CD-ROM disks require careful handling.Nearly all drives require that protective &quot;caddies&quot; be usedwith disks; that can either mean lots of loading andunloading of caddies, or buying one caddy for each disk youown. They cost about $10 each and are hard to find.   But there is a bonus to buying a CD-ROM drive. Most of thedrives can also play regular audio CDs, so you can hear BillyJoel or Bach while you work.
