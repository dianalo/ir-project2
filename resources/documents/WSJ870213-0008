The company said it will post a $2 million charge for the fourth period to provide for possible losses from the disposition of assets, hazardous waste removal and other claims.    Sales for the year were about even with 1985 sales of $397 million, the company said. Last September the company said it expected 1986 profit from continuing operations to fall below the 1985 level of $5.9 million, or 82 cents a share. Changes in the federal tax law also increased the company's 1986 tax expenses, the company said. Dallas will, however, show a positive net income for 1986 compared with a net loss of $2 million in 1985, the company said.    Dallas makes building products for commercial, industrial and residential construction. Costs of plant conversions, startups at two plants and equipment malfunctions hurt fourth-quarter profit, the company said. Earnings were also impaired by a decline in commercial and residential construction in the Southwest.    In the year-ago fourth quarter, the company reported profit from continuing operations of $702,000, or 10 cents a share, a loss from discontinued operations of $2.8 million and a net loss of $2.1 million. Sales were $105 million in the 1985 fourth quarter.    The company said it plans price increases in 1987, has undertaken cost-control programs and realigned management in response to low profits. Dallas is also extending its operations to other geographic regions. The changes aren't expected to have a material effect on earnings until mid-1987, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
