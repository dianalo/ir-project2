Nopickup.^By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state-run PAP news agency on Thursdaysaid action was taken to end a 10-day-old strike at the huge Leninsteel mill in the Krakow suburb of Nowa Huta, and an official inKrakow said the strike had ended.   PAP also warned employees to stay away from the Gdansk shipyard,where striking workers, including Solidarity leader Lech Walesa,were occupying the facility. PAP quoted management as saying thatworkers not participating in the strike will receive paid leaves ofabsence until the strike was settled.   ``There's no strike any longer,'' a switchboard operater at theLenin steelworks in Nowa Huta said at 8:30 a.m. (2:30 a.m. EDT).She said no one from management was available to answer questions.   ``I don't expect they (the striking workers) left themselves,''said Bogdan Drej, the Krakow city spokemsan, confirming that thesteel mill strike had ended. ``So I assume they had to be helped toleave.   ``In the languages of press communiques, this means that forcesof order making use of available means, assured again thepossibility of normal operation of the combine.''   An aide in the government press office in Warsaw said no one wasavailable to answer questions.   PAP reported that ``actions were undertaken this morning aimedto ensure normal functioning of all departments'' at the hugeplant. No more specific information was given in the dispatch.   It said the strike had threatened ``the fundamental interests ofthe society and national economy.'' Strikers had said about halfthe 32,000 workers were on strike, the government had put thenumber at a few thousand.   Workers also were told to stay away from the shipyard in Gdansk``until further notice,'' PAP said. About 7,000 workers at theshipyard in the Baltic port went on strike Monday, the fourthstoppage since April 25 in Poland's worst wave of labor unrestsince the 1981 military crackdown on Solidarity.   Walesa, founder of the outlawed labor federation, spentWednesday night at the shipyard where he works as an electrician.   ``Due to the existing situation which makes impsossible thenormal functioning of the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, its activity isbeing suspended until further notice,'' the management said in acommunique carried by PAP.   ``The workers not striking will have paid leaves ensured forthis period. I appeal to all working on the first and second shiftsnot to come to work starting today, May 5,'' it said.   ``Management of the shipyard will choose and inform in aseparate notice workers indispensible for ensuring of theappropriate equipment in the shipyard,'' the news agency said.   The reported action in Nowa Huta came less than 24 hours aftergovernment spokesman Jerzy Urban accused the strikers of``terrorist'' tactics and threatened ``serious consequences.''   Earlier today, the strike committee at Nowa Huta said it waspromised talks with management through the help of Roman Catholicchurch mediators. Those talks were supposed to take place today.   But strike leaders at the Gdansk shipyard said on Wednesday thatmanagement had refused to church-mediated talks with its strikecommittee.   The strikers at both plants demanded higher wages, anindependent union, reinstatement of fired union activists andrelease of political prisoners.   On Wednesday, five independent Catholic intellectuals acting atthe church's request arrived at the striking shipyard andsteelworks to serve as mediators. The government would not say ifit had authorized the move.   Also, Roman Catholic bishops urged authorities to find a commonground with Poles by meeting with representative groups.   Urban indicated authorities may crack down if the unrestcontinues.   ``We shall not allow any anarchy,'' he said Wednesday onnational radio and television. ``The two wildcat strikes havedegenerated, and I am warning, they may result in seriousconsequences.''   Urban said employees who tried to resume work at the Nowa Hutasteel mill were threatened by strikers armed with bottles. He saidthat in the Gdansk shipyard, groups of strikers threatenedmanagement and workers and pulled drivers from cars as they weredelivering materials around the yard.   ``We are talking here about terrorist actions,'' Urban said.</TEXT></DOC>
