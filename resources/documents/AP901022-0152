Duffy worked for a British company, Merz and McLellan, in Kuwaitwhen Iraq invaded Aug. 2.   A Foreign Office spokesman said the Iraqi Foreign Ministryreported Duffy's death to the British Embassy in Baghdad on Sunday,but did not say where he died.   Duffy, who had no history of heart trouble, worked for thecompany for 26 years, mostly on foreign postings. His widow saidshe received a letter from him two weeks ago saying he was well.   He was among hundreds of Britons held at various facilities inIraq as part of President Saddam Hussein's policy of using Westernhostages to deter an attack, British officials said.   Earlier Monday, the Foreign Office said Iraqi troops in Kuwaithave rounded up seven more Britons and are holding them at theRegency Hotel in Kuwait City to await transfer to Iraq.   ``It is illegal and deplorable, like all the others(detained),'' said a spokesman, who requested anonymity.   He said the men rounded up were ``almost certainly in hiding,''but there were no details of how they were caught.   The Foreign Office said there were 650 Britons left in Kuwait,most in hiding, and about 800 Britons trapped in Iraq, including340 being held at strategic locations.   Former British Prime Minister Edward Heath said Saddam promisedon Sunday to release an unspecified number of sick or elderlyBritons.   An aircraft from British-based Virgin Atlantic airline isscheduled to fly to the Iraqi capital of Baghdad on Tuesday forHeath and to possibly return freed hostages.   Duffy was the third Briton to die in Iraq or Kuwait since theinvasion.   A Scottish scientist, William Norrie Atack, 46, died in Kuwaitthis month. A 45-year-old businessman, Douglas Thomas Croskery, wasshot to death in August while trying to escape from Kuwait.   Three members of the Irish parliament were granted Iraqi visasMonday for a November trip to Baghdad to plead for the release ofnationals trapped by the gulf crisis.   The legislators are expected to meet Iraqi government officials,but it was not known whether they would talk directly with Saddam.   Ireland's Gulf Relatives Support Committee asked the legislatorsto make the trip, which is not formally sanctioned by the Irishgovernment.</TEXT></DOC>
