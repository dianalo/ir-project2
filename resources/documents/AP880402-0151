With b0660-b0661, b0662.</NOTE><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Here, briefly, is how carbon-dating works:   All living things absorb carbon 14, a radioactive isotopecreated by rays bombarding the Earth's atmosphere from outer space.   There is a certain proportion of carbon 14 to nonradioactivecarbon 12 in the air and in living things. While plants and animalsare alive, this proportion remains the same. When they die, theystop absorbing carbon 14.   Because it is radioactive, carbon 14 decays at a known rate. Ittakes 5,730 years for half the carbon 14 to decay.   Carbon 12 does not decay. So by measuring the proportion ofcarbon 14 to carbon 12 left in a sample, scientists can tell whenthe plant or animal it came from died.   To count carbon atoms, a sample must first be converted intocarbon dioxide. This is done by burning.   A technique more advanced from original procedures used in the1940s, when carbon-dating was first applied, uses a nuclearatom-counting machine called an accelerator mass spectrometer.   It propels carbon dioxide through a tube at tremendous speed,causing the various atomic particles to separate and making itpossible to detect carbon 12 and carbon 14.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 3</NOTE></DOC>
