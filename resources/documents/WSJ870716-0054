The identity of the buyer couldn't be learned.    A person close to the La Mirada, Calif.-based restaurant chain confirmed last night that such an agreement has been made and would be announced today. But he disputed a Wall Street source's assertion that the price tag would be $1 billion. However, the individual close to the company said that the price would significantly exceed the $854 million offer by Marriott Corp., a Bethesda, Md.-based lodging and food service company that was previously turned down by Denny's.    As previously reported, Marriott had approached closely held Denny's last May about buying the company. Marriott was interested in buying the company's 1,185 Denny's restaurants in 43 states and six foreign countries and its 42% stake in the 780-unit Winchell's Donut House L. P. chain.    Denny's, with 1986 revenue of $1.3 billion, also operates 68 El Pollo Loco Mexican-style chicken restaurants, which were not part of Marriott's proposal.    In early 1985, Denny's was acquired by an investor group in a leveraged buyout valued at $45 a share, or $800 million. The buyout group, led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, the investment banking arm of New York-based Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., included about 50 of the company's top managers.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company.    In 1984 -- its last year as a public company -- Denny's reported net income of $44.8 million. Sources close to the company have said Denny's has remained profitable, although its margins have fluctuated in recent years and competition has been sharp.    Originally a chain of coffee shops, Denny's in recent years has developed into a full-menu operation that aggressively markets special items and regional dishes.    Since ending talks with Marriott last week, Denny's has been courted by at least two other suitors, a source said. The identity of those suitors couldn't immediately be learned. </TEXT></DOC>
