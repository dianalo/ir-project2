Three 757-200s valued at $150 million will be delivered as soonas possible, said Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman RandyHarrison.   The planes were to be delivered in June but were held up when theState Department's Office of Munitions Control suspended the exportlicenses for crucial navigational components in the aircraft,department spokesman Ken Bailes has said.   President Bush halted all sales of military equipment to Chinafollowing the killing of hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators inBeijing on June 4.   The State Department on Friday lifted the suspensions on thethree planes and on one other plane that is scheduled for deliverylater this month, Harrison said.   ``As far as I know, the State Department has reviewed thesuspensions and decided that these items are not part of theoriginal intent of the presidential trade sanctions,'' Harrison said.   State Department spokesman Dennis Harter said the suspensionorder was lifted for Honeywell Corp. navigational systems used inthe Boeing planes. The navigational systems are on the controlledU.S. munitions list.   ``Our decision is in keeping with the president's intent not todisrupt non-military commercial trade with the Peoples Republic ofChina and was based on the fact that these navigational systems aredesigned for inclusion in civilian products and are critical to thesafe operation of commercial aircraft,'' Harter said.   ``To have denied these exports would have jeopardized the safetyof civilian airline passengers traveling in China.''   Harter said the order also authorizes Honeywell to repair andreplace defective navational systems in civilian Chinese aircraft.   Original dates of delivery of two aircraft to Guangzhou Airlineswere June 12 and June 22. The due date for one airplane for ShanghaiAirlines was June 17, Harrison said.   The planes have a two-class seating configuration for between 176and 180 passengers, Harrison said. He did not know when actualdelivery would take place.   The Chinese Aviation Administration Corporation system alreadyoperates five 757-200s, Harrison said. The Chinese government haspurchased 61 Boeing airplanes of all models since 1971, with a totalvalue of $2.35 billion.   The Chinese government is still awaiting delivery of anotherseven aircraft. The 11-plane deal is valued at $650 million,Harrison said.</TEXT></DOC>
