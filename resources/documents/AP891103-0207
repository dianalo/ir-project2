The conservative New Democracy Party staged a concert of popularGreek music at Olympic Stadium in Athens, and former socialistPremier Andreas Papandreou addressed a rally of his party'ssupporters in the northern city of Salonica.   New Democracy leader Constantine Mitsotakis expressed confidencethat his party would win an outright majority Sunday. His partyadvocates closer ties with the West.   ``A bright victory lies ahead, not only for us but for Greece,''Mitsotakis said before the concert, which featured three of themost popular Greek composers.   The 71-year-old conservative leader said this week that if hisparty did not win a clear majority it would move to hold newelections rather than cooperate with any other party.   In June, New Democracy defeated Papandreou's socialists butfailed to gain a majority of the 300 seats in Parliament. It teamedwith the Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress to endPapandreou's eight-year administration and investigate charges ofcorruption in that government.   The unusual conservative-communist governing alliance hadPapandreou and five former ministers indicted by Parliament inSeptember for alleged complicity in scandals.   Papandreou, 70, has appeared unfazed by his indictment oncharges of authorizing the widespread telephone wiretaps while inoffice and charges of complicity in the embezzling of $210 millionfrom a bank.   Special high courts are expected to try him and his ministersearly next year.   ``Hands off Andreas,'' his supporters chanted throughout hisspeech in a central square in Salonica.   Papandreou has promised to increase private and publicinvestment, fight unemployment, and boost farmers' income ifelected.   The communist coalition has refused to cooperate with thesocialists so long as it is led by Papandreou. They also say thatit is impossible to govern with New Democracy because theirprograms are incompatible.</TEXT></DOC>
