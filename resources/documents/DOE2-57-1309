It was revealedrecently that alkoxide polymers containing Ti, Zr, Nb, Ta possess photocatalyticactivities in the region of visible light. Alkoxide polymers of variousmetal elements such as Cu, Ga, Y, La, Ge, Sn, V, Mn, which were nevertested until now, were prepared. And ESR intensity response by visiblelight and the behavior in methanol adsorption were measured. Furthermore,the photographic sensitivities of these polymers were defined and measuredby the variations of ESR intensity during visible light illuminationin methanol vapor. Hydrogen generating rate in methanol/water systemwas compared with ESR intensity, and it was found that there is a correlationclose to a proportional relation between them, except for the polymerscontaining Ti and Zr.
