The measurements were conducted at room temperature(20+-3 deg C) and alternating current in the 1-50 kHz frequency range.It is shown that introduction into fluoroplastic composition resultsin a monotonous decrease of electric conductivity. The dependence ofelectric conductivity on composition for the TPA-PVA system includestwo parts and reflects chemical interaction in the solid phase. An analyticalform of the composition of double-composite mixtures is derived.</TEXT></DOC>
