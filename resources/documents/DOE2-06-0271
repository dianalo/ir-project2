Image distortion from aircraft movement preventedprecise image-to-image registration in some areas. However, when smallscenes were used (190 to 240 hectares), a first-order linear transformationprovided registration accuracies less than or equal to one pixel. A largerarea was successfully registered using a piecewise linear method. Fivewetland classes and one transitional community were indentified and evaluatedfor change. Phenological differences and the variable distribution ofvegetation limited wetland type discrimination. Using unsupervised methodsand ground-collected vegetation data, overall classification accuraciesranged from 84 to 87 percent for each scene. A post-classification changeanalysis identified wetlands transformations in some areas. Cypress-tupeloswamp forest was commonly replaced by more thermally and flood-tolerantmarsh species. In areas where cooling water releases were discontinued,invasion by scrub/shrub communities occurred. Results show that multi-date,high-resolution aircraft MSS data can be registered if small areas areused, and that wetland vegetation change can be accurately detected andmonitored. 33 refs., 6 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
