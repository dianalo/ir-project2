Cooling downto 77 K, the flexural strength of PEEK-CF increased to about 20 % thanthat at room temperature. The data of flexural strength for the irradiatedspecimens showed some scattering, but the strength and modulus at 77K were changed scarcely up to 120 MGy. The flexural strength and modulusin the unirradiated specimen decreased with increasing of measurementtemperature, and the strength at 140 deg C, which is the just below temperatureof the glass transition of PEEK, was to 70 % of the value at room temperature.For the irradiated specimens, the strength and modulus increased withdose and the values at 140 deg C for the specimen irradiated with 120MGy were nearly the same with the unirradiated specimen measured at roomtemperature. The improvement of mechanical properties at high temperatureby irradiation was supported by a viscoelastic measurement in which theglass transition shifted to the higher temperature by the radiation-inducedcrosslinking. A glass fiber reinforced PEEK composite (PEEK-GF) was preparedand its irradiation effects by electron beam was studied. UnirradiatedPEEK-GF showed the same performance with that for GFRP of epoxide resinas matrix material, but by irradiation the flexual strength and modulusdecreased with dose. It was revealed that this composite was destroyedby delamination because inter laminar shear strength (ILSS) decreasedwith dose and analysis of the profile of S-S curve showed typical delamination.Fractoglaphy by electron microscopy supported the delamination whichis caused by the lowering of adhesion on interface between the fiberand matrix with increase of dose.</TEXT></DOC>
