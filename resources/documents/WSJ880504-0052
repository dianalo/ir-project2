A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. both tended to recommend stocks of small companies, while others, such as Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc., emphasized shares of big companies. Investors who followed the firms' recommendations benefited -- or suffered -- accordingly.    A study of brokerage houses' stock-picking prowess by Zacks Investment Research Inc. of Chicago shows that the issues selected by Edwards gained an estimated 15.1% in the first quarter. Next best was a 14.1% gain for Merrill Lynch's recommended stocks. The smallest gains were the 2.9% notched by Thomson McKinnon and 3% for Drexel Burnham.    The study, conducted quarterly by Zacks for The Wall Street Journal, estimates the value of brokerage-house stock recommendations to individual investors. The strong first-quarter showing by Edwards enabled it to wrest the 12-month lead from Thomson McKinnon, which excelled in the first running of the study, published earlier this year.    Stocks selected by St. Louis-based Edwards, the only non-New York firm among the 10 large brokerage houses studied, gained an estimated 0.3% for the 12 months, according to the Zacks tally. Slim though it is, the gain looks good in a period that included October's historic stock crash. Buying the other nine houses' favorite stocks, Zacks figures, would have led to losses ranging from 2.4% (for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.) to 15.0% (for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.).    The stocks recommended by seven of the 10 houses last quarter outperformed the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index, which contains the stocks of relatively large companies. And stocks selected by eight of the firms outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average, whose 30 stocks all have large market capitalization.    Because small stocks did so well in the first quarter, however, none of the firms' recommended lists was able to beat the 16.9% jump in the &quot;Zacks Universe&quot; average. That's the average of the approximately 3,000 stocks followed by the 10 brokerage houses; because the stocks are weighted equally and most are relatively small, it amounts to a small-stock index.    Some firms have criticized the study's methodology, particularly its once-a-month system for pricing recommended stocks. But several investment authorities not associated with the firms say it gives a fair measure of the usefulness of the recommendations to individual investors.    The study measures stock-picking ability only. It doesn't consider another important type of advice: asset allocation, which is the apportioning of an investor's assets among stocks, bonds, cash and other alternatives. The brokerage houses that do best in stock-picking don't always do best in asset allocation, and vice versa.    Here's a firm-by-firm rundown of how the brokerage houses have done and what they expect:   DEAN WITTER: &quot;I'm not looking to knock the cover off the ball,&quot; says Manny Korman, Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.'s research director, &quot;because I'm unwilling to accept the risk that would entail.&quot; He anticipates a volatile market, with the industrial average oscillating between 1800 and 2100 for the next several months. In that climate, he favors chemical stocks and defensive issues, such as food, beverage and tobacco stocks. &quot;Sometimes,&quot; he says, &quot;the tortoise wins the race.&quot;    This particular tortoise was in the middle of the pack for the past 12 months and the latest quarter. For the full 21 months covered by the Zacks study, however, it brings up the rear.    DREXEL BURNHAM: The typical company on Drexel's &quot;Priority Selection List,&quot; according to the Zacks analysis, has a market value of $5.6 billion. That's about the size of Xerox Corp., one of the largest 100 U.S. corporations in market value. As a result, Drexel missed the action in small stocks, eking out a meager 3% gain in the first quarter and dropping to ninth from fifth in the 12-month rankings.    Drexel's picks generated no fireworks, either on the winning or losing side. Only two of its recommended stocks gained more than 25% during the 12 months: Mobil Corp., up 32%, and General Public Utilities Corp., up 29%. Drexel research director Arthur Kirsch points out that the firm's &quot;Priority Selection List&quot; deliberately sticks to about 35 big stocks suitable for most investors; individual Drexel analysts also recommend other, smaller stocks, however.    A.G. EDWARDS: The firm, which has led the three-month results for the past two quarters, recommended the smallest stocks overall of any house in the study -- with an average market value of $692 million, as of March 1. But Terry Dessent, director of research, is reluctant to attribute the firm's stock-picking success to the size of the stocks. He thinks the firm's emphasis on stocks that appear to be undervalued is the reason its recommendations have been performing so well.    The firm's picks do outscore most competitors on some common measures of value. For instance, its favorites had the highest average dividend yield (3.3%) and the lowest price-to-book-value ratio (2.38). In addition, their price-earnings ratio (11.8) was among the three lowest. Other firms use similar value measures, however, and didn't do nearly so well.    Edwards doesn't have a recommended list as such. Zacks judges the firm on the basis of the stocks its analysts say to &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;accumulate.&quot;    Four of Edwards's recommended stocks -- Elgin National Industries Inc., Union Special Machine Corp., Murray Ohio Manufacturing Co. and Acme Steel Co. -- got a boost from takeovers or takeover rumors. &quot;We don't recommend stocks on that basis,&quot; Mr. Dessent says. But he suggests that value-oriented stocks often attract takeover bids.    KIDDER PEABODY: Losses in such stocks as Consolidated Stores Corp., Texas Air Corp. and Catalyst Energy Corp. held Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. to eighth place in the 12-month ranking. Longer term, Kidder moved up to fifth, partly because of a change in how it was judged.    Kidder used to publish two separate lists of recommended stocks -- a basic list and a high-risk list. Last fall, however, it discontinued the high-risk list and transferred some stocks from it to the basic list. In its previous analysis, Zacks judged Kidder on both lists combined. This time results were recalculated to reflect only the basic list, which Kidder says better reflects the advice customers were given by the firm's registered representatives before the high-risk list was dropped.    R. Joseph Fuchs, appointed Kidder's director of research earlier this year, says he expects a &quot;muddle-through environment&quot; with &quot;treacherous&quot; volatility for the next few months. His list now is tilted toward energy, &quot;predictable growth,&quot; and selected manufacturing stocks.    MERRILL LYNCH: Because there's no recommended list at Merrill, Zacks's evaluation is based on the stocks given a No. 1 rating for the &quot;intermediate term,&quot; or up to a year, by Merrill's securities analysts. The individual analysts must be doing something right, since Merrill was among the top three finishers in each period.    Partly because it follows so many stocks, Merrill had more big winners and big losers than any other firm. Gillette Co., Beecham PLC, Alberto Culver Co., Koppers Inc. and Compaq Computer Corp. all gained more than 80% during the 12 months. Lear Petroleum Corp., Safecard Services Inc., Texas Air Corp., Boys Markets Inc. and Matrix Science Corp. all lost more than 60%.    &quot;Our breadth of focus,&quot; says Andrew Melnick, research director, allows Merrill to &quot;find companies that others might not find, at a reasonably early stage.&quot;    PAINEWEBBER: Though it was in the middle of the pack overall for every time period, PaineWebber Inc. also generated a lot of ups and downs for people who went along with its picks. Inland Steel Industries Inc., for example, rose 90% in the past year, and E-II Holdings Inc. rose 82%. But Hadson Corp. dropped 56% and Deb Shops Inc. fell 55%.    Margo Alexander, PaineWebber's director of research, says the firm has made a special effort lately to give customers timely advice on takeover situations, such as Sterling Drug Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc. But because takeovers are &quot;fast-moving situations,&quot; she says, that advice typically doesn't show up on the recommended list.    PRUDENTIAL-BACHE: Despite a respectable showing last quarter, Prudential-Bache dropped to the bottom of the 12-month rankings -- a far cry from its third-place finish in the first run of the Zacks study. The key to the big drop was the first quarter of 1987. Back then, the firm had chalked up a scorching 35.4% gain -- by far the best quarterly gain any firm has achieved in the study. But that quarter isn't part of the most recent 12 months, during which Prudential-Bache suffered nasty losses in such stocks as Environmental Treatment andamp; Technology Corp., Xyvision Inc., QMS Inc., Fur Vault Inc. and Matrix Science Corp.    &quot;I'm not satisfied with the performance, but I'm pleased that we have bounced back in the first quarter,&quot; says Michael Culp, director of research. &quot;Probably we were early in focusing on small-cap names. The small-caps (companies with small market value) really got crushed in October.&quot;    SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON: &quot;What you don't see on the list&quot; often is as important as what you do see, says Jack Rivkin, Shearson's director of research. &quot;We have underweighted retailing (stocks) since last July. I think that's helped us.&quot; Indeed, Shearson -- along with Drexel Burnham and Thomson McKinnon -- was relatively successful at avoiding major losers. But, unlike those two firms, it also came up with some blockbuster winners. In Britoil PLC, up 140%, and Stanadyne Inc., up 104%, it boasted the only two picks that doubled during the past 12 months. (Both were takeover situations.) Thus, Shearson managed to come in second or third in every time period.    Mr. Rivkin favors stocks that are expected to show major growth in earnings. Currently, he likes capital-goods stocks, such as Clark Equipment Co. and Deere andamp; Co. He continues to avoid consumer stocks, figuring that consumers will be &quot;fairly tame&quot; in spending for a year or more.    SMITH BARNEY: New to the survey is Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., replacing E.F. Hutton, which was swallowed by Shearson. Smith Barney didn't enter the pool with a big splash, though. It was eighth for the recent quarter and seventh for both the 12-month and 21-month periods. Retail stocks such as Limited Inc. (down 51%) and Liz Claiborne Inc. (down 41%) proved to be poor bets, as did Marion Labs Inc. (down 42%) and Prime Computer Inc. (down 42%).    D. Larry Smith, director of research, says the Zacks study gives an incomplete picture because it ignores advice on which sectors to emphasize. For example, he says Smith Barney recommends a heavy weighting on energy, but doesn't necessarily have many energy stocks on its list; investors are expected to put more money into those stocks than others. (Over the past 12 months, most of Smith Barney's recommended energy issues have been flat. For the full 21 months covered by the study, however, Smith Barney scored gains of 47% in Royal Dutch Petroleum Corp. and 22% in Amoco Corp.)    THOMSON MCKINNON: Thomson publishes several different recommended lists, some of which are specialized; Zacks judges it on the more general &quot;Long-Term Investment&quot; list. The firm's research director, Harry Zisson, recently pulled Digital Equipment Corp. and General Electric Co. (both losers over the past 12 months) off that list, but it's still heavy with large-company stocks. Despite last quarter's puny 2.9% return, Mr. Zisson believes the &quot;blue-chip sector is still the place&quot; to be. He expects the market to be &quot;institutionally dominated,&quot; and thinks stock prices will be volatile but show little if any net gain during 1988.    ---   How the Big Brokerage Houses' Favorite Stocks Performed Estimated performance of stocks recommended by major securities firms in periods ending March 31, 1988, and biggest gainers and losers for each firm during the 12 months ended March 31 A.G.
