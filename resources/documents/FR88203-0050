All Orders are to be promulgatedthrough the rulemaking process and, and when issued in final form, applyon a nationwide basis. A table is included in andSection; 3164.1 that showsall existing or formal Orders. This proposed rulemaking would result inanother Order. It is intended specifically to supplement the provisionsof andSection; 3162.7-1_Disposition of production, and andSection; 3162.7-3_Measurementof gas, and Subpart 3163.Section 3162.7-3 requires that all production be measured by orifice meteror other methods acceptable to the authorized officer. This order wouldset out specific and detailed requirements that are minimum standards forgas measurement by orifice meter, based on the standards and specificationspublished by the American Gas Association (AGA) ``Orifice Metering of NaturalGas'' Committee Report No. 3, 2nd editions (August 1985) and the AmericanPetroleum Institute (API) Standard 2530. This publication is referred toin the Order as AGA Committee Report No. 3. Those items selected for inclusionin this Order as requirements are those which are necessary to ensure thatgas production is measured accurately, so that the Federal Government,the general public, and State governments, which share in the proceeds,and Indian mineral owners will receive all royalties due under the variousoil and gas leases. Specific comments are requested on whether the requirementsof this Order should be phased in over a period of time for existing facilitiesand how long such a period of time should be.The Bureau is aware of the existence of old (10 to 15 years) purchase contractswhereby the lessee/operator is committed to sell the gas for a fixed priceranging from 4 to 50 cents per thousand cubic feet (MCF), and of the existenceof wells producing at very low volumes (100 MCF per day or less). Compliancewith the minimum standards requiring specific equipment for the measurementof the flowing gas temperature, adherence to proper Beta ratio, and therequirement for the secondary element to record the static and differentialpressure in at least the middle one-third of the production chart couldresult in materials and labor costs out of proportion to any potentialadditional royalty income derived from the well. Such costs could promptpremature abandonment or shut-in, resulting in the lost of potential gasreserves and royalty payments. For example, the cost of compliance withthe requirement that the flowing gas temperature be measured could be $1,000per well. However, under a typical old contract with a price of 30 centsper MCF, and a royalty of 12.5 percent, production of 100 MCF per day wouldproduce an annual royalty of $900. On the other hand, requiring compliancein the above situation with a temperature error 10 degrees would only increaseroyalties by 9 dollars per year. Even at current prices of $2.70 per MCFand a 1 percent volume error, the increase in royalty in this example wouldonly be $81 per year. If such a well were abandoned because of the costof compliance, these royalties and the reserves in the ground would belost. Therefore, we believe that it would be in the public interest toexempt certain wells from some requirements of this Order. The public isspecifically requested to comment on (a) the criteria for determining whichwells or fields should be exempted from these standards and (b) the particularminimum standards that may be subject to exemption. It is expected thatno well would be exempted from this Order as a whole, but that any exemptionwould apply only to specific appropriate minimum standards set forth inthe Order. With regard to other possible systems of gas measurement which may be acceptableto the authorized officer, the Order would set forth no specific or detailedrequirements or minimum standards for any such method, but would clearlyrequire, for any and all such methods, that prior approval by the authorizedofficer is necessary before any alternate gas measurement method may beemployed. The application for approval to use any alternate system forgas measurement would be required to furnish convincing evidence that theproposed system will measure gas accurately and result in no loss of royaltyto the Federal Government or Indian mineral owners.The Order would set out a procedure whereby an operator may request approvalfor a variance from any of the required minimum standards. An applicationfor variance would be required to propose an alternative means for satisfactionof the minimum standard.The Order would also contain provisions for corrective actions and normalabatement periods. These would set out for each minimum standard, the correctiveaction necessary when an incident of noncompliance with the minimum standardis detected, and the time frame within which such corrective action shallbe taken. Many of these abatement periods are shown as ``Prior to salesor removal'' in this proposal. Specific comments are requested on whetherany or all of these provisions should also specify a firm deadline as analternative. For example, ``Prior to sales or removal, or 30 days, whicheveroccurs first.''The principal authors of this proposed rulemaking are Mr. Richard T. Hunter,Lakewood, Colorado, Mr. Terry Messerli, Billings, Montana, and Mr. UpendraParikh, Jackson, Mississippi, assisted by the Orders Task Group, the staffof the Office of Legislation and Regulatory Management, all of the Bureauof Land Management, the Office of the Solicitor, Department of the Interior,and Mr. Jim Fisher, retired from the Bureau of Land Management. Mr. ScottEllis, Minerals Management Service, was also part of the Orders Committeeand provided input on royalty accounting issues.It is hereby determined that this rulemaking does not constitute a majorFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environmentand that no detailed statement pursuant to 102(2)(C) of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(c)) is required.The Proposed Order would have minimal adverse economic effects, since itsrequirements reflect the operating practices currently followed by prudentoperators when gas production is measured in accordance with the standardsand specifications published by the American Gas Association (AGA) andthe American Petroleum Institute (API). The proposed Order may providea beneficial economic effect, in that industry is less likely to be subjectedto assessments or penalties resulting from violations and/or the requirementto undertake costly remedial actions, if it has a better understandingof this Bureau's requirements for the measurement of gas production. TheState governments that share in the royalties collected and Indian mineralowners will also benefit from assurance of more accurate gas measurement.The minimum standards established by this Order essentially are those whichhave been required but not promulgated by this Department and would imposethe same burden on all lessees and operators, regardless of size, on landswhere the measurement of gas production is under the jurisdiction of thisBureau. Therefore, the Department of the Interior has determined that thisdocument is not a major rule under Executive Order 12291, and that it willnot have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of smallentities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601).The information collection requirements contained in this proposed rulemakinghave been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> and assigned clearance numbers 1004-0134, 1004-0135, and1004-0136.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 43 CFR Part 3160</ITAG>Government contracts, Mineral royalties, Oil and gas exploration, Oil andgas production, Public lands_Mineral resources, Indian lands_Mineral resources,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Under the authority of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended andsupplemented (30 U.S.C. 181 <T3>et seq.</T3>), it is proposed to amend Part 3160, Group 3100, SubchapterC, Chapter II of Title 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations as set forthbelow:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 3160_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.

Introduction</ITAG>A. AuthorityThis Order is established pursuant to the authority granted to the Secretaryof the Interior pursuant to various Federal and Indian mineral leasingstatutes and the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982. Thisauthority has been delegated to the Bureau of Land Management and is implementedby the onshore oil and gas operating regulations contained in 43 CFR Part3160. Section 3164.1 thereof specifically authorizes the director to issueOnshore Oil and Gas Orders when necessary to implement or supplement theoperating regulations and provides that all such Orders shall be bindingon the lessees and operators of Federal and restricted Indian oil and gasleases which have been, or may hereafter, be issued.Specific authority for the provisions contained in this Order is foundat: andSection; 3162.7-1, <T3>Disposition of production</T3>; section 3162.7-3, <T3>Measurement of gas</T3>; and subpart 3163, Noncompliance and assessments.B. PurposeOne purpose of this Order is to establish requirements and minimum standardsfor the measurement of gas by the methods authorized in 43 CFR 3162.7-3,i.e., measurement by orifice meter or other methods acceptable to the authorizedofficer. Proper gas measurement ensures that the Federal Government, thegeneral public, State Governments which share in the proceeds, and Indianmineral owners receive the royalties due, as specified in the governingoil and gas leases.Another purpose of this Order is to establish abatement periods for correctiveaction when noncompliance with the minimum standards is detected, and tospecify the assessments and penalties that will be imposed as a resultof noncompliance and/or a failure to correct the noncompliance within thespecified abatement period.C. ScopeThis Order is applicable to all Federal and Indian (except Osage) oil andgas leases. In addition, this Order is also applicable to State or privatelyowned lands when Federal and/or Indian leases are entitled to share inthe revenues from non-jurisdictional wells under the terms of an approvedagreement.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Definitions </ITAG>A. Authorized representative means any entity or individual authorizedby the Secretary to perform duties by cooperative agreement, contract,or memorandum of understanding (43 CFR 3160.0-5).B. Production unit means, for purposes of reporting production, a measurementunit of 1000 standard cubic feet (Mcf).C. Standard cubic foot means the volume of gas contained in one cubic footat a base pressure of 14.73 pounds per square inch absolute (psia), ata base temperature of 60anddegrees;F or 520anddegrees; Rankine (43 CFR 3162.7-3).D. By-pass means any piping arrangement connected upstream and downstreamof a meter that allows gas to continue on the sales line without passingthrough the meter. Equipment that permits the changing of the orifice platewithout bleeding the pressure off the gas meter run shall not be considereda by-pass.E. Incident of Noncompliance (INC) means a notice transmitted to a lesseeor operator (Form 3160-9) that a violation of this Order has occurred,and serves as a notice of violation.F. Lessee means the party authorized by or through a lease or an approvedassignment to explore for, develop and produce oil and gas on the leasesite in accordance with the lease terms, regulations, and law. For convenienceof reference, the term ``lessee'' also refers to and includes the ownersof approved operating rights and designated operators (see 43 CFR 3160.0-5).G. Major violation means noncompliance which causes or threatens immediate,substantial, and adverse impacts on public health and safety, the environment,production accountability, or royalty income (see 43 CFR 3160.0-5).H. Minor violation means noncompliance which does not rise to the levelof a major violation (see 43 CFR 3160.0-5).I. Gas means any fluid, either combustible or noncombustible, which isproduced in a natural state from the earth and which maintains a gaseousor rarefied state at standard temperature and pressure conditions (see43 CFR 3000.0-5(a)).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Requirements</ITAG>All gas production shall be measured in accordance with an authorized methodof measurement. As set out in 43 CFR 3162.7-3, gas measurement authorizedfor gas produced from leases, units, and communitization agreements subjectto the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management, as such jurisdictionis defined in 43 CFR 3161.1, may be by orifice meter or other methods acceptableto the authorized officer. The requirements and minimum standards for gasmeasurement are set out in this Order.The requirements of this Order are based on the standards and specificationspublished by the American Gas Association (AGA) Committee Report No. 3.and the American Petroleum Institute (API). The AGA and the API publishedstandards and specifications and considered to be appropriate for propergas measurement by both the Department of the Interior and the Oil andGas Industry. The requirements set minimum standards necessary to promoteconservation of natural resources and to ensure proper measurement of gasproduction for sales purposes, so that the Federal Government and Indianmineral owners will receive the royalties due under governing oil and gasleases.A. Gas Measurement by Orifice MeterThe following are recognized as minimum standards for measurement of naturalgas using orifice meters.

TheBTU content most recently determined and used for royalty purposes shallbe reported monthly to the authorized officer on Form 3160-6.<T3>Violation: </T3>Minor.<T3>Corrective Action: </T3>Conduct test for weighted average BTU and submiton an amended Form 3160-6 the proper weighted average BTU.<T3>Abatement Period: </T3>20 days.26. Operators shall submit a copy of the meter calibration report to theauthorized officer within 30 working days.<T3>Violation: </T3>Minor.<T3>Corrective Action: </T3>Submit meter calibration report(s) to authorizedofficer.<T3>Abatement Period: </T3>10 days.27. No special form is required, but all meter calibration report formsshall include the following information, if applicable:a. Name of producer or seller.b. Name of purchaser.c. Federal or Indian lease number, communitization agreement number, orunit name or number, and participating area identification.d. Station or meter number.e. Meter data (make, differential and static range, recording period).f. Type of connections (flange or pipe, upstream, or downstream staticconnections).g. Orifice data (plate size and ID of meter tube).h. Base of data used on each chart or record (temperature, specific gravity,atmospheric pressure, integration value, etc.).i. Name of company performing the integration.j. Time and date of test.k. Instrument error(s) found and certification of corrections, and ``found''and ``left'' data for all instruments.l. Signature and affiliation of tester and witness.m. Remarks.<T3>Violation: </T3>Minor.<T3>Corrective Action: </T3>Submit amended meter calibration report(s)to authorized officer, including all required information.<T3>Abatement Period: </T3>10 days.28. For purposes of measurement and meter calibration, atmospheric pressureis that value defined in the buy/sell contract (normally assumed to bea constant value). In the absence of such a definition in the buy/sellcontract, the atmospheric pressure shall be established as a constant valuebased on the elevation at the metering station.<T3>Violation: </T3>Minor.<T3>Corrective Action: </T3>Recalibrate gas meter and submit amended Form3160-6 indicating correcting volumes due to adjusted ``absolute zero''or incorrectly calculated pressure extensions.<T3>Abatement Period: </T3>20 days.29. The method and frequency of determining specific gravity are normallydefined in the buy/sell contract. Except when a continuous recording gravitometeris used, specific gravity may be determined at the time of an instrumentcheck using a spot or cumulative gas sample, and is usually effective thefirst of the following month. The continuous recorder may be of a balanceof kinematic type. Also, specific gravity may be determined from a laboratoryanalysis of a spot or cumulative gas sample.<T3>Violation: </T3>Minor.<T3>Corrective Action: </T3>Redetermine specific gravity of gas by approvedmethod and submit an amended Form 3160-6 with corrected volume.<T3>Abatement Period: </T3>20 days.30. The operator shall keep all test data, meter reports, charts/recordings,or other similar records for 6 years from the date they were generated,or if involved in an audit or investigation, the records shall be maintaineduntil the record holder is released by the Secretary from the obligationto maintain them. The authorized officer and/or authorized representativemay request these records any time within this period. Records submittedshall include all additional information used to compute volumes so thatcomputations may be verified.<T3>Violation: </T3>Major.<T3>Corrective Action: </T3>Submit data as required.<T3>Abatement Period: </T3>20 days.<T3>B. Gas Measurement by Other Methods or at Other Locations Acceptableto the Authorized Officer</T3>Using any method of gas measurement other than by orifice meter at a locationon the lease, unit, or communitized area, requires prior approval fromthe authorized officer pursuant to 43 CFR 3162.7-3. Other measurement methodsinclude, but are not limited to:<ITAG tagnum="15">Turbine metering systems</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Pitot tube</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Orifice well tester</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Critical flow prover</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Gas-oil ratio</ITAG>The requirements and minimum standards for gas measurement on the lease,unit, or communitized area by an alternate method of measurement, or ata location off the lease, unit, or communitized area by either an authorizedor an alternate method of measurement, are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="81">1. </ITAG><T3>Measurement on the Lease, Unit, or Communitized Area</T3>a. An application for approval of an alternate gas measurement method shallbe submitted to the authorized officer and approval obtained before anysuch alternate gas measurement method is installed or operated. Any lessee/operatorrequesting approval of any alternate gas sales measurement system shallsubmit performance data, actual field test results, or any other supportingdata or evidence acceptable to the authorized officer, that will demonstratethat the proposed alternate gas sales measurement system will perform withreliability and accuracy equal to or exceeding gas measurement by orificemeter.<T3>Violation: </T3>Major.<T3>Corrective Action: </T3>Submit application and obtain approval.Abatement Period: Prior to sales.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. </ITAG><T3>Measurement at a Location Off the Lease, Unit, or Communitized Area</T3>a. An application for off-lease measurement shall be submitted to the authorizedofficer and approval obtained before any such off-lease gas measurementfacilities are installed or operated. The application for approval of off-leasemeasurement shall justify location of the measurement facilities at thedesired off-lease location before approval will be granted, but no additionalapproval as to the gas sales measurement method is required, provided measurementis to be accomplished by orifice meter pursuant to the requirements andminimum standards of this Order.<T3>Violation: </T3>Minor.<T3>Corrective Action: </T3>Submit application and obtain approval.<T3>Abatement Period: </T3>20 days.b. If gas measurement is to be accomplished at a location off the lease,unit, or communitized area by any alternate measurement method (any methodother than measurement by orifice meter), then the application, in additionto justifying the location of the measurement facilities, shall also demonstratethe acceptability of the alternate measurement method pursuant to Sec.III B 1 of this Order.<T3>Violation: </T3>Major.<T3>Corrective Action: </T3>Submit application and obtain approval.<T3>Abatement Period: </T3>Prior to sales.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Variances From Minimum Standards</ITAG>An operator may request that the authorized officer approve a variancefrom any of the minimum standards prescribed in Section III. All such requestsshall be submitted in writing to the appropriate authorized officer andshall provide information as to the circumstances warranting approval ofthe variance(s) requested and the proposed alternative means by which therelated minimum standard(s) will be satisfied. The authorized officer,after considering all relevant factors, shall approve the requested variance(s)if it is determined that the proposed alternative(s) meets or exceeds theobjectives of the applicable minimum standard(s), or does not adverselyaffect royalty income or production accountability.<ITAG tagnum="84">Attachment</ITAG>I.
