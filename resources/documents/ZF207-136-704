(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>TOOLS ARE IMPROVING AS DB2 GETS MORE USEandM;The battle for the mainframe relational database market may not be over, butIBM's DB2 has established a commanding lead.andP;  Almost 4,000 copies have beeninstalled to date, approximately half of those in the last year.andP;  As theintegration of DB2 continues, it is likely to be used more as the number ofapplication development tools that work with it increases.andM;Although organizations have introduced DB2 into their shops, they have notbeen quick to move it into key production applications.andP;  As a relationalDBMS, DB2 is supposed to be easier to use than older technologies, such asIMS, the structured DBMS from IBM.andP;  But &quot;easier to use&quot; doesn't translateinto instant expertise.andP;  Organizations that have spent over 10 years learningIMS to its best advantage are only gradually integrating DB2 into theiroperations.andM;The first applications for DB2 were oriented toward the information centerand information retrieval.andP;  But companies quickly learned that SQL, the mainlanguage of DB2, is not designed for the casual user.andP;  As a result, many areusing query tools and report writers to meet the need for information access.andM;Query Management Facility (QMF) is designed to simplify database access forthe DB2 or SQL/DS user.andP;  It provides three facilities: an interactive SQL,Query-By-Example (QBE) and a report writer.andP;  For all but the simplest oftasks, SQL is a programmer's language because it requires a detailedunderstanding of its syntax and semantics to produce correct results.andM;IBM has added a prompting mode to QMF which helps the user construct the SQLnecessary to solve many business problems.andP;  This prompting interface issubstantially similar to that in OS/2 Extended Edition Query Manager.andM;However, for end users, QBE may be an easier tool to master.andP;  Developed atIBM in the mid-70s by Moishe Zloof (now at Ashton-Tate), it presents an imageof a DB2 table or tables in which the user puts values under the appropriatecolumn.andP;  For example, selecting all the customers in Boston from the Customertable would look like Table 1.andM;QBE is powerful enough so that most things that can be expressed in SQL canbe specified in QBE.andP;  On PCs, Paradox, from Borland International, ScottsValley, Calif., and dBase IV, from Ashton-Tate, Torrance, Calif., have bothadopted variations of QBE as an end-user language.andM;QMF uses the data from either a QBE or an SQL query to format into a reportor graph.andP;  The report writing facility uses a command- and forms-basedapproach for specifying layout of the report and to control breaks.andP;  It alsoallows crosstab reports.andM;A crosstab report is formatted so that the values of one database field makeup the columns, values of a second field make up the rows and a summary of athird field is reported.andP;  For example, Table 2 lists the products a companysold across the top, the customers on each row and the total amount orderedfor each product by each customer.andM;Natural language is another approach to querying databases that makes usingDB2 easier for the non-programmer.andP;  Intellect, from AICorp, Waltham, Mass.,andO;translates English language requests into SQL, which are then run againstDB2.andP;  A problem may occur with natural language when a user's question isinterpreted differently from his or her intent.andP;  Intellect avoids thisproblem by echoing back the generated SQL so that the request can bevalidated.andM;TRAINING INCLUDEDandM;La-Z-Boy Chair Company in Monroe, Mich., has been using DB2 since 1986.andP;  Thecompany implemented DB2 so managers and analysts would not have to wait forCobol programs to be written; they wanted to provide direct end-user accessto the data.andP;  Management turned to Intellect after using QMF, which did notprovide the transparency of access required.andM;No product works if users do not know what is in the database, so La-Z-Boyprovides training not only in using Intellect but in the contents of thedatabase.andM;Frank Kolebuck, vice president of MIS, reports that the users are quitehappy.andP;  Non-data processing users, such as marketing analysts and costaccountants, can get the information they need from the over eight millionrows of data in about 75 DB2 tables.andP;  They are even getting answers toquestions which were previously impossible to get because of programmingbacklogs.andM;One of the most widely used programs with DB2 is Focus, from InformationBuilders, Inc., New York City.andP;  Usually thought of as a report writer andanalytical tool, IBI has extended Focus to make it useful for developingfull-scale DB2 applications.andM;The DB2 catalog information is automatically captured into the Focusdictionary, where additional information, such as column validations, arekept.andP;  Either SQL or Focus language can be executed against DB2.andP;  BecauseFocus has interfaces to other file and database systems, such as Vsam andIMS, data from various sources can be combined in reports.andM;The Dylakor Division of Sterling Software, Chatsworth, Calif., has addedDYL-Interface DB2 to DYL 280 and DYL 280 II, to allow DB2 databases to beprocessed.andP;  SQL can be embedded in the report specification to retrieve data,which is then formatted into a report or used in statistical analysis.andM;Questions about DB2 performance have made many companies reluctant to use DB2in production applications, particularly those that process transactions at ahigh rate.andP;  IBM is addressing this objection by gradually improving theperformance of DB2.andP;  With the release of version 2, IBM markets DB2 as a DBMSfor all applications, while claiming transaction rates in excess of 200transactions per second (TPS).andM;However, most companies not only want the DBMS to be fast but also forapplications to be implemented rapidly.andP;  The dearth of applicationdevelopment tools has thus slowed the adoption of DB2.andP;  To address the needfor a fourth-generation language (4GL), many vendors are porting theirproducts to DB2.andM;Because most of the 4GLs for DB2 have been released only recently, or areabout to be released, very few 4GL applications have yet reached theproduction stage.andP;  Many of them are still prototypes.andM;IBM has made Cross System Product (CSP) its entry for serious applicationdevelopment.andP;  Originally intended for use on midrange systems, CSPapplications can be developed in a wide range of environments, including MVSwith TSO or CICS, VM/CMS and DOS with CICS.andM;Applications can be executed but not developed on MS-DOS systems.andP;  They caneven be developed on VM with SQL/DS for production under MVS with DB2.andP;  CSPwill also work with Vsam files and IMS databases.andM;Integral Systems, Walnut Creek, Calif., is a developer of human resourcemanagement software.andP;  The company's strategy is to develop products that willwork with their clients' choice of DBMS.andP;  Integral is also committed toworking with 4GLs to attain better programming productivity.andP;  For IBMmainframes, they have used Natural from Software AG to work with Adabas,Ideal from ADR to work with Datacom/DB and CSP from IBM to work with DB2 andSQL/DS.andM;Steve Knowles, SAA product manager, is very happy with CSP.andP;  He points outthat the release of version 3 of CSP has features that are necessary for itto work with DB2, as well as a PERFORM verb to build the applicationsmodularly.andM;Development has been much faster than programming in Cobol.andP;  CSP uses the DB2catalog to pick up the data definitions with which it works.andP;  It willgenerate default SQL access for tables or views which can be edited.andM;For example, it is necessary to edit the defaults to specify joing conditionsbetween tables.andP;  To help debug applications, there is a test facility thatruns in interpretive mode and provides tools such as breakpoint setting andtracing data items.andM;The performance of generated applications has been surprisingly good.andO;Although not quite as fast as Cobol, a reasonable-sized database with over 20operators produces subsecond response time.andP;  This is in part due to the factthat CSP applications can use static SQL, which provides for fasterprocessing than dynamic SQL.andM;The success of DB2 has exerted great pressure on the independent mainframeDBMS vendors.andP;  Many are allowing their 4GL to work with DB2.andP;  Three of thelargest independents have taken this route: ADR, Princeton, N.J.andP;  (now partof Computer Associates), Cincom, Cincinnati, and Software AG, Reston, Va.andM;Ideal from ADR has been used to good advantage by Datacom/DB users, and it isADR's hope that it will find similar favor with the DB2 community.andP;  Ideal isa high-level programming language that uses SQL to access DB2.andP;  It runspseudo-conversationally under CICS.andP;  SQL statements may be embedded in Ideal,just like in a Cobol program.andM;Alternatively, high-level Ideal constructs, such as a FOR EACH tablestatement, may be automatically translated into the appropriate SQL.andP;  Idealprovides a screen painter for panel definition and a report writer.andP;  Panelsare created, named and saved independently from the procedures in which theyare used.andM;After debugging, the application can be compiled using static SQL.andP;  An Idealutility helps simplify this process.andM;Natural 2 from Software AG is also a high-level programming language that hasbeen extended to work with DB2 and SQL/DS, as well as its own DBMS, Adabas.andO;In particular, Natural 2 allows an organization that has data in a variety ofother file systems or DBMSs (including Vsam, VL/1 and IMS) to bring themtogether in a single application.andP;  It also supports a wide range ofteleprocessing monitors, including CICS (both conversationally andpseudo-conversationally) and IMS/DC.andM;The interface to DB2 is through SQL, which is automatically generated fromNatural statements.andP;  This SQL cannot be modified.andP;  For performance, staticSQL can be generated.andM;Ingres, from Relational technology, Inc. of Alameda, Calif., is moving itsfront ends, the Ingres Tools, to run against DB2, SQL/DS and IMS usingIngres/Gateway.andP;  Not only will the Ingres Tools run on a mainframe, but theywill also provide access to DB2 data from PCs, VAXs and other platforms.andO;Applications can be built using dynamic SQL, and run using static SQL forefficiency.andM;Unlike many of the other vendors who are copying the DB2 catalog informationinto their own dictionary, RTI is using the DB2 catalog itself.andP;  The companypoints out that in an active environment where DB2 data definitions maychange, this direct coupling helps maintain integrity.andM;RTI is also a pioneer on the distributed database front.andP;  It is the onlyvendor to optimize distributed joins of data across a network.andP;  The newrelease of Ingres/Star will extend this optimization to heterogeneousdatabases so that data from different DBMSs on different platforms can belinked more efficiently.andM;MICROS TO PLAY LARGER ROLEandM;PC-based tools will play an increasingly important role in using DB2.andP;  Thiscomes from two main factors.andP;  First, the PC environment provides better userinterfaces than 3270-type terminals, or PCs acting as 3270s.andM;Because the screen is tied to local memory and processing, screens can bebit-oriented instead of character-oriented.andP;  Changes to the data can beimmediately reflected on the screens with no communications delay.andM;Secondly, the processing overhead of managing complex front ends is quitehigh.andP;  Moving that out to the PC, where on or more mips may be devoted to it,frees the mainframe for database use or number crunching.andM;PC/SQL Link, from Micro Decision-ware, Boulder, Colo., provides a menu-basedsystem for construction of SQL statements under MS-DOS.andP;  The statements aresent to the mainframe, where DB2 or SQL/DS finds the data which is returnedto the PC.andP;  The prompts and menus minimize the amount of SQL knowledgerequired, as well as providing a better interface than 3270-styleinteraction.andM;DB/Access, Santa Clara, Calif., also provides end-user access to DB2 orSQL/DS data using its View/PC in conjunction with its Access/Star.andP;  View/PCprovides a Microsoft Windows-based interface that leads the user through theconstruction of an SQL query and then sends it to the mainframe, whereAccess/Star manages the interface with the host DBMS.andP;  Of particular interestis that Access/Star will also provide data to other non-IBM hosts, such asVAXs or HP 3000s.andM;SQL Windows, from Gupta Technologies, Meno Park, Calif., is designed forbuilding applications that work in the bit-mapped environment of MicrosoftWindows and Presentation Manager.andP;  Running under Windows itself, it isvisually-oriented, uses pull-down menus and dialogus boxes, and effectivelyuses a mouse to help build applications.andM;OUTLINER AND SCREEN PAINTERandM;The package also uses a combination of an outliner and an interactive screenpainter to develop applications.andP;  With a new application, a default outlineappears on the left of the screen and the window editor on the right.andM;In the window editor, a complex form can be designed, with text, multilinetables, dialogus boxes, scroll bars, pop-up menus, push buttons, radiobuttons and check boxes.andP;  As these objects are placed in the window, the codefor producing them is automatically created in the outline.andM;SQL Windows uses the LU 6.2 protocol for process-to-process communication.andO;Presently, it only works with DB2 on mainframes and its own DBMS, SQLBase, onPCs.andP;  SQL Windows will work with SQL/DS when VM supports LU 6.2.andM;The advent of database servers on PCs will soon increase the number of toolsavailable for DB2 users.andP;  The techniques for communicating with the serversare all based on SQL and are similar to the requirements for working withDB2.andP;  As tools are released from Lotus and others, expect them to work inmultiple environments.andM;The popularity of DB2 is going to increase, and the large number ofinstallations will act like a magnet for independent software vendors.andP;  Thereare some good choices now for query languages, report writers and 4GLs.andP;  Inthe future, the existing products will be better, and there will be many newones from which to choose.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
