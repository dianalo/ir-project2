By their calculations, that will be 23.65 million barrelsa day -- slightly above current output, but equal to whattheir own technical experts say is needed from theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries over the nextthree months.</LP><TEXT>   The ministers, who reached their informal agreement lastnight after two days of talks, called the new productionlevel a &quot;ceiling,&quot; and said it is intended to stabilize oilmarkets by meeting world demand during the high-use wintermonths. It is also designed to help move OPEC toward a $2 abarrel increase over the current average of $19 to $20.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, the OPECnews -- including a decision to reconvene ahead of the nextscheduled meeting in November, if the reference price isn'tmet -- helped crude oil recover from a slide brought on bylessening tensions between the U.S. and Iraq. November crudeon the Nymex, which had dropped below $22 a barrel during thetrading day, came back to close at $22.21, up two cents fromTuesday's close. (The OPEC price is an average of severaldifferent kinds of crude that tends to lag the Nymex price by$2 to $3 a barrel.)   Despite the ceiling term the ministers used, oil analystshere for the OPEC meeting said the arrangement continues theexport group's recent &quot;free-for-all&quot; approach to production.Also, it provides little additional room for any Iraq andKuwait oil exports for the remainder of this year.   Still, analysts said, the new production level is unlikelyto exert any downward pressure on prices because of theseasonal rise in demand in the fourth quarter combined withslumping supplies from non-OPEC producers, such as the SovietUnion. &quot;Everybody is producing at capacity, and the fourthquarter is prone to tightness anyway,&quot; said Michael Rothman,a senior energy futures analysts at Merrill Lynch.   Several oil ministers, including those from Iran andAlgeria, wanted a stronger effort to get the price to $21quickly, mainly by holding production slightly below theanticipated level of demand. Still, Nordine Ait Laoussine,the Algerian minister, said that &quot;under the circumstances,this is the best we can do.&quot;   But Gholamrezah Aghazadeh, the Iranian minister,questioned whether some OPEC members really wanted to advancethe price. &quot;In my opinion,&quot; he said in an interview, &quot;if OPECwanted to very seriously, we could reach $21.&quot;   Most ministers said they expect to achieve the $21reference price soon, however. &quot;We are hoping we will reachit in a month,&quot; said Abdulla Salem El Badri, the Libyanminister.   Still, some oil ministers said Mr. Aghazadeh and othershad been critical of Saudi Arabia during the meeting. HishamNazer, the Saudi oil minister, had said soon after hisarrival here this week that he was also committed to reaching$21, but only if it were left to market forces rather than toOPEC actions. He advocated a higher ceiling -- 24.5 millionbarrels a day, according to Saudi delegates -- and restakedthe kingdom's claim to a fourth-quarter production level of8.5 million barrels a day, whatever the outcome of the OPECtalks.   After the meeting ended last night, Mr. Nazer reaffirmedhis belief that oil demand is surging more than his peers hadestimated. &quot;There is a buoyant market,&quot; he said. &quot;In fact, wecan't keep up with it.&quot;   Although the fourth-quarter ceiling is sharply higher thanthe previous widely ignored voluntary production limit of22.3 million barrels of oil a day, it is a more realisticreflection of actual output, according to outside estimates.Petroleum Argus, an oil industry publication, will reportMonday that OPEC's September output has averaged slightlymore than 23.5 million barrels a day.   There wasn't any discussion of individual country quotasunder the new production ceiling. &quot;Demand is better than theceiling,&quot; said Iran's Mr. Aghazadeh. Also, he said, OPEC'scapacity isn't any larger than the ceiling. &quot;That means wedon't need to discuss quotas,&quot; he said.   Some oil ministers, nevertheless, are worried about nextyear, particularly the second quarter, when oil demand beginsto drop seasonally and considerably more oil from Iraq andKuwait is expected to be flowing into world markets.   &quot;The challenge for OPEC will come in the month of Marchwhen we have to decide what the production level will be inthe second quarter,&quot; Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oilminister, said in an interview.</TEXT></DOC>
