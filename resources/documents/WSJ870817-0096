Denver-based Manville, whose reorganization plan was confirmed by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland here in December, said the appeal would delay its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings until &quot;sometime after the first of next year.&quot;    The building and forest products concern filed for Chapter 11 protection in August 1982, when it was faced with a flood of asbestos-related lawsuits claiming death, disease or property damage. Asbestos, a mineral, was once widely used in piping and insulation and can cause deadly lung diseases and cancers that often don't show up for years.    The appeal, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit here, wasn't a surprise. Aaron Simon, a Los Angeles attorney who represents the dissident group, was formerly a member of the bankruptcy committee that represented health claimants, but resigned over proposals to pay claimants through a $2.5 billion to $3 billion trust that would insulate Manville from future claims. He has vowed repeatedly to take his group's objections to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. </TEXT></DOC>
