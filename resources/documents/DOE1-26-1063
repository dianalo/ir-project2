Average annualfatalities for the modes and submodes are compared. Factors which mightinfluence society's valuation of risk are examined - victim age, trendsin fatalities, and variability of fatalities. Finally, other measuresof risk (fatalities per ton-mile, per passenger-mile, and per vehicle)are presented to help judge the acceptability of existing risk levels.</TEXT></DOC>
