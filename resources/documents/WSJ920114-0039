Kozo Watanabe, Japan's minister of international trade andindustry, and Hisham Nazer, Saudi oil minister, agreed thatthe two countries should go ahead with feasibility studiesunder the renewed plan of establishing three joint-venturerefineries in Japan with a total capacity of 450,000 barrelsa day.</LP><TEXT>   Under the original plan, three Japanese companies --Nippon Oil Co., Nippon Mining Co. and Arabian Oil Co. -- hadbeen studying with the Saudis since last year the possibilityof building one 150,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Japan and a300,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Saudi Arabia. The size ofthe Saudi refinery will be left unchanged from the originalplan.   The companies said they haven't decided how the threerefineries will be accommodated in the project, which will be50%-owned by Saudi Arabia. The other 50% will be owned by thethree companies plus Caltex Petroleum Corp. of the U.S.,which owns a 50% stake in Nippon Petroleum Refining Co., arefining arm of Nippon Oil.   The project will enable Japan, which is almost entirelydependent on imported oil, to strengthen ties with theworld's largest oil exporter while giving Saudi Arabia accessto the lucrative Japanese oil product market, oil industryofficials and analysts have said.</TEXT></DOC>
