The Denver-based group, the American Energy Assurance Council,said its members hope to stage a 48-hour simulated oil crisis inthe third week of November, with 100 participants, and persuade oneof the television networks to make an hour-long program out of it.   ``Polls indicate that national leaders and the American publicare convinced there will be another energy crisis,'' said one ofthe organizers, Gov. George A. Sinner of North Dakota. But, headded, ``Energy policy has fallen off the national agenda,''especially since crude oil plunged from $28 a barrel to less than$10 in 1986.   Charles Ebinger, a staff member at the Center for Strategic andInternational Studies and an energy consultant, said, ``The purposeof the game is to convince everyone that on the basis of thecurrent impasse, that no one is going to win their agenda.   ``Environmentalists may see their interests run roughshod overin another crisis and oil and gas companies may have to acceptprice controls again, which isn't in their interests either,''Ebinger said.   The rules of the game have not been decided upon. When it isover, organizers of the group hope to get conflicting interests tostart serious bargaining on a few unspecified topics whereagreement might be possible.   Crude prices have recovered to about $18, but are stillconsidered low in the oil patch. Asked why an oil crisis waslikely, Michael Beatty, senior vice president of Coastal Corp., aHouston-based oil and gas producer, said, ``Low prices arestimulating consumption and rapidly expanding demand for cheapoverseas oil.''   Crude and product imports now account for 39 percent of U.S.consumption, up from 34 percent this time last year.   John Jenkins, president of the group, said it will try ``tograpple with conflicting solutions,'' such as theconservation-at-any-price vision backed by some environmentalorganizations and the expand-production-everywhere solution of someoil companies.   ``We are working together with people whose views we vehementlydisagree with,'' Beatty said.   The group includes consevation advocate Amory Lovins and aconsuming-state governor, Thomas Kean of New Jersey.</TEXT></DOC>
