U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein on Monday also ordered acomplete overhaul of the financially ailing Manville Corp. trustfund created to compensate victims of diseases such as lung cancerand mesothelioma.   But Weinstein said the only possible solution to ``thiswasteful, inefficient war over asbestos'' may be to group all ofsome 90,000 outstanding cases into one class-action lawsuit beforehim.   The judge asked lawyers for about 40 defendant companies andthousands of victims exposed to asbestos on the job to agree on aconverting the cases. That would remove cases from the dockets of500 state courts and all 96 federal courts.   ``The courts ... are now so overloaded with drug cases and othermatters that the extra burden of asbestos litigation is seriouslyinterfering with the administration of justice in this country,''Weinstein said.   Consolidating the cases also would sharply reduce payments toplaintiffs lawyers, who have received as much as 40 percent ofcompensation payments to victims.   Asbestos, a white mineral with natural heat-resistance andinsulation properties, was widely used in shipbuilding,construction and other industries for decades. Lengthy exposure hasbeen found to cause cancer and other serious and often fataldiseases.   In his order, Weinstein also temporarily froze all payments bythe Manville trust, citing a ``severe cash shortage ...constituting a judicial emergency.'' Included in the stay arepayments of any settlements, court judgments and legal fees.Ongoing court cases are not affected.   He ordered that the trust, created in 1988 as part of ManvilleCorp.'s bankruptcy court reorganization, be restructured andrefinanced by Aug. 6 to allow quicker payments to the neediestvictims of asbestos-related disease.   The Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust is out of cash topay new claims and has said that people who file claims now may notget paid until well into the 21st century.   The cash shortage has been induced by more cases, larger payoutsand quicker settlements than expected. To date, the trust has paid$974 million to settle more than 22,300 cases, an average paymentof about $43,000 per claim.   Weinstein is involved in the asbestos saga because he issupervising, along with a state judge, 579 cases consolidated fortrial involving former workers of the Brooklyn Navy Yard.   Weinstein called for a new method to compensate workers andtheir families who were most seriously injured by asbestos diseasesand need money immediately. He supported installment payments tovictims to maximize the trust's available funds.   ``Those workers and their families who were most seriouslyinjured must secure compensation immediately,'' Weinstein said.   That would replace the system developed in bankruptcy court thatpays victims on the basis of when they file a claim rather than thenature of their disease, one of the most highly criticized featuresof the trust.   On refinancing, Weinstein suggested several steps, includinghundreds of millions of dollars in loans or advances from Manville;sale of control of Manville by transferring the trust's assets; orthe trust buying the entire company.   As part of its Chapter 11 reorganization, Denver-based Manvilleplaced $2.5 billion in assets, mostly stock, into the trust. Thecompany also agreed to contribute $75 million annually starting in1991 plus 20 percent of annual net income from 1992 until allclaims are paid. The trust effectively controls 80 percent ofManville.   Weinstein supported an injunction prohibiting asbestos victimsfrom directly suing Manville, a measure he hinted at recently,because ``the value of the trust depends upon a healthy, viablecorporation.''   David Austern, general counsel for the Washington-based trust,said he would ask the trustees whether to object to the stay ofpayments.   According to court documents, the trust has on hand $93.2million to pay $112.8 million in claims already settled. That moneyis frozen by the judge's order.</TEXT></DOC>
