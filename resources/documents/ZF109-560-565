(VSAT satellite networks) (Very Small Aperturesatellite Terminals)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Knowles, Anne.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>According to market analysts, the very small aperture satelliteterminal (VSAT) satellite network market is one of only a fewcommunication equipment areas experiencing high growth.andP;  The VSATmarket has risen about 50 percent, going from $220 million in 1988to $325 million in 1989.andP;  During 1990 and 1991, another 50 percentincrease is expected.andP;  VSAT network prices have dropped and thisis one reason for the increase in use.andP;  In some situations VSATsare economical alternatives to packet switching and leased linesnetworks.andP;  Technical problems that once plagued VSATs have mostlybeen corrected but glitches are occurring in network management.andO;One of the main problems is that users of VSAT network managementsystems need to be highly-skilled.andP;  These people are expensive tohire or hard to train.andP;  They systems themselves are not userfriendly and are rudimentary at best.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Very Small Aperture TerminalsSatellite CarriersNetworksMarket AnalysisNetwork Management.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
