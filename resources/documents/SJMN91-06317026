He arrived from Portugal with his wife andsix children, and his first jobs were working by day at a sausage factory andat night as a unionized janitor.;   Twenty-four years later, at the pinnacleof his career, his $5 million janitorial company has become the target of afiery year-long campaign by union and community organizers to win better pay,benefits and working conditions for janitors who work at Apple Computer Inc.,his biggest customer.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  EMBATTLED BOSS TELLS HIS SIDEJANITOR FIRM OWNER DENIES MISTREATMENT,EXPLOITATION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See also related story on page 6E in this section  </MEMO><TEXT>     Until now, Pereira, 49, has chosen to let his lawyer speak for him inresponse to the demonstrations, vigils and labor charges filed against hiscompany, Shine Building Maintenance Inc. But a community coalition's plan tohold a hunger strike in front of Apple's headquarters in Cupertino today hasforced him out of his customary silence, which he confesses was partly due toan immigrant's embarrassment about speaking to the press with his heavyaccent.;   To the community, church and labor coalition allied against him --the &quot;Cleaning up Silicon Valley&quot; coalition -- Shine is an exploitive company.;  &quot;We believe that Shine Building Maintenance disregards the rights of theiremployees: their right to a decent wage and living standard and the legalrights under state and federal law to a workplace free from harassment and aworkplace free from health and safety hazards,&quot; said Jon Barton, director oforganizing for the Service Employees International Union.;   But Pereira, whoangrily denies that he mistreats his workers, said he has become the victim ofa powerful and well-organized union campaign.;   &quot;It's been terrifying,&quot; hesaid. &quot;Sometimes I ask myself how I put up with this thing. I'm for justice,not against it, but not the way they like to do justice.&quot;;   Pereira said theunion's confrontational tactics rankled him from the beginning. His firstformal contact with them came when a group of about 20 people with banners andsigns marched into his company offices. Since then, the Service Employeesunion has picketed his Campbell home as well as the home of Apple CEO JohnSculley. The union admits it picketed his office early in its campaign butsaid the march was a spontaneous protest after Pereira fired two workersactive in the organizing drive.;   The union sees Pereira as a guy with bigbucks who won't share the wealth. He drives a Rolls Royce and a BMW, oneorganizer said. But Pereira, who says he has only four years of formaleducation, said his salary is $120,000, and half of that goes to his firstwife. The Rolls, a 20-year-old car, was recently sold, and the BMW is a 1985model with more than 100,000 miles on it.;   Pereira said he sympathizes withhis workers, but the business' slim margin leaves little room for generosity.;  &quot;No one knows better than I do that $5.50 to $6 an hour is not a decent wagefor anyone to live on,&quot; he said. In his first job, Pereira supported his largefamily on $1.68 an hour.;   &quot;I feel sorry for them, but what am I going todo?&quot; &quot;I cannot pay more than that and be in business more than a week or two,&quot;he said. &quot;I have to pay what the competition pays.&quot;;   Fighting the union haseaten further into company profits. Shine General Manager John L. Krauseestimates the firm lost about $250,000 in contracts this year after the unionpressured several clients. Another $160,000 went to legal fees in connectionwith the union drive. All this has been costly for a firm that managers saidhas profit margins of only 2 to 3 percent.;   Yet Pereira said he will nevergive in to the union's demand to represent his workers unless it holds anelection at his company and wins it.;   The union wants the company torecognize it outright, without an election, a legal tactic unions haveembraced recently because they say new labor laws make it harder for them towin traditional election drives. And in the case of Shine, organizers say thecompany environment is so &quot;tainted&quot; with anti-union sentiment that a fairelection isn't possible.;   But Pereira is determined he'll make his stand onthis issue, even if he loses his main client, Apple, in the battle. Apple isnow deciding which firm to award its next janitorial contract to.;   &quot;Even ifthey come and cut my throat out, I'll say let's let these people have anelection,&quot; Pereira said. &quot;I don't mind the union, and I said this all along.But I won't make decisions for people.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MICHELLE LEVANDER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911112  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  809  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, November 12, 199100317026,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
