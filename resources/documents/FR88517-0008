Because of the need for immediateguidance in this regard, the Internal Revenue Service has found it to beimpractical to issue these temporary regulation either with notice andpublic comment procedure under section 553(b) of Title 5 of the UnitedStates Code, or under the effective date limitation of section 553(d) ofTitle 5.<ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Provisions</ITAG>Prior LawPrior to 1987, if a taxpayer sustained a foreign source loss with respectto income in a separate limitation category, the loss was treated as offsettingthe taxpayer's U.S. source income before offsetting foreign source incomesubject to another separate limitation. A foreign tax credit was allowedfor the taxpayer's other foreign source income if that income was subjectto foreign tax. Thus, it was possible for a taxpayer to enjoy a doublebenefit in a single taxable year in the form of reduced U.S. source incomeand a foreign tax credit.Statutory ProvisionSection 1203 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 amended section 904(f) by addingparagraph (5) at the end thereof which requires that a foreign source losswith respect to any income category first offset the taxpayer's foreignsource income subject to other separate limitations for the taxable yearon a proportionate basis before the loss offsets the taxpayer's U.S. sourceincome.<ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Temporary Regulations</ITAG>The Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed the order in which foreign source lossesoffset U.S. source and foreign source income of a taxpayer and expandedthe number of separate limitation categories for income. The TemporaryRegulations contained in this document provide transition rules for thetreatment of overall foreign losses incurred by a taxpayer in taxable yearsbeginning before January 1, 1987 (pre-effective date years), that are recapturedin taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986 (post-effective dateyears). In addition, transition rules are provided for an overall foreignloss that is part of a net operating loss incurred in a pre-effective dateyear which is carried forward to a post-effective date year and for anoverall foreign loss that is part of a net operating loss incurred in apost-effective date year which is carried back to a pre-effective dateyear.Section 1.904(f)-13T Transition Rules.Paragraph (a)(1) provides that an overall foreign loss incurred in a pre-effectivedate year shall be recaptured in post-effective date years by recharacterizingincome received in the income category described in section 904(d) as ineffect for post-effective date years that is analogous to the income categoryfor which the overall foreign loss account was established. For example,an overall foreign loss incurred with respect to the income category describedin section 904(d)(1)(B) (Dividends from a DISC or former DISC) as in effectfor pre-effective date years shall be recaptured from income earned inthe income category described in section 904(d)(1)(F) (Dividends from aDISC or former DISC) as in effect for post-effective date years.Paragraph (a)(2)(i) provides, in general, that an overall foreign lossincurred in the general limitation category of section 904(d)(1)(E), asin effect for pre-effective date years, shall be recaptured from the taxpayer'spost-effective date general limitation income, financial services income,shipping income and dividends from each noncontrolled section 902 corporation.If the sum of the taxpayer's general limitation income, financial servicesincome, shipping income and dividends from each noncontrolled section 902corporation for a taxable year subject to recapture exceeds the pre-effectivedate overall foreign loss to be recaptured, then the amount of each typeof separate limitation income that will be treated as U.S. source incomeis determined pursuant to a formula set forth in paragraph (a)(2)(i).Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) provides an exception to the general rule for recaptureof an overall foreign loss in the general limitation category of section904(d)(1)(E) as in effect for pre-effective date years if a taxpayer candemonstrate to the satisfaction of the Internal Revenue Service that theloss is attributable, in sums certain, to one or more separate categoriesof section 904(d)(1), as in effect for post-effective date taxable years.In such a case, the taxpayer may recapture the loss (in the amounts demonstrated)from those limitation categories only.Paragraph (a)(3) provides that an overall foreign loss incurred by a taxpayerin a pre-effective date year shall be recaptured to the extent thereofbefore recapture of post-effective date overall foreign losses.Paragraph (b) provides that an overall foreign loss that is part of a netoperating loss incurred in a pre-effective date taxable year which is carriedforward to a post-effective date year will be allocated first to incomein the income category analogous to the income category set forth in section904(d) as in effect for pre-effective date taxable years in which the lossoccurred. If the loss exceeds income in the analogous income category,the loss shall be allocated to other foreign source income earned by thetaxpayer in accordance with the rules set forth in section 904(f)(5). Lossesremaining after application of section 904(f)(5) shall be allocated tothe taxpayer's U.S. source income, which will create an addition to thetaxpayer's overall foreign loss account.Paragraph (c)(1) provides that an overall foreign loss that is part ofa net operating loss incurred by the taxpayer in a post-effective datetaxable year which is carried back to a pre-effective date taxable yearshall be allocated first to income in the pre-effective date income categoryanalogous to the income catetgory set forth in section 904(d) as in effectfor post-effective date taxable years in which the loss occurred. The generallimitation income category for pre-effective date years shall be treatedas the income category that is analogous to post-effective date generallimitation income, financial services income, shipping income, dividendsfrom each noncontrolled section 902 corporation and high withholding taxinterest income.Paragraph (c)(2) provides that if an overall foreign loss carred back toa pre-effective date taxable year exceeds the foreign source income inthe analogous category for the carry back year, the remaining loss shallbe allocated against U.S. source income as set forth in andSection; 1.904(f)-3.An addition to an overall foreign loss account resulting from the carryback of a net operating loss shall be treated as having been incurred bythe taxpayer in the year in which the loss arose and shall be subject torecapture pursuant to section 904(f) as in effect for post-effective dateyears.Paragraph (c)(3) provides that to the extent that an overall foreign losscarried back as part of a net operating loss exceeds the separate limitationincome to which it is allocated and the U.S. source income of the taxpayerfor the taxable year, the loss shall be allocated pro rata to other separatelimitation income of the taxpayer for the taxable year. However, thereshall be no recharacterization of separate limitation income pursuant tosection 904(f)(5) as a result of the allocation of the net operating lossto other separate limitation income of the taxpayer.Paragraph (d) provides that for taxable years beginning after December31, 1986, and before January 1, 1991, the rules set forth in andSection;1.904(f)-6 shall apply for purposes of recapturing general limitation andforeign oil related income (FORI) overall foreign losses incurred in taxableyears beginning before January 1, 1983 (pre-1983). For taxable years beginningafter December 31, 1990, the rules set forth in andSection; 1.904(f)-13Tshall apply for purposes of recapturing pre-1983 general limitation andFORI overall foreign losses.Paragraph (e) provides that the rules set forth in paragraph (a)(2) shallapply for purposes of recapturing overall foreign losses incurred in taxableyears beginning before January 1, 1983, that were computed on a combinedbasis in accordance with andSection; 1.904(f)-1(c)(1).<ITAG tagnum="84">Nonapplicability of Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The Treasury Department has determined that these temporary regulationsare not subject to review under Executive Order 12291.

For its taxable year ending December 31, 1988, Xhas $800 of financial services income, $100 of general limitation incomeand $100 of shipping income. X has a balance of $100 in its general limitationoverall foreign loss account which resulted from an overall foreign lossincurred during its 1986 taxable year. X is unable to demonstrate to whichof the income categories set forth in section 904(d)(1) the loss is attributable.In addition, X has a balance of $100 in its shipping overall foreign lossaccount attributable to a shipping loss incurred during its 1987 taxableyear. X has no other overall foreign loss accounts. Pursuant to section904(f)(1), the full amount in each of X corporation's overall foreign lossaccounts is subject to recapture since $200 (the sum of those amounts)is less than 50% of X's foreign source taxable income for its 1988 taxableyear, or $500. X's overall foreign loss incurred during its 1986 taxableyear is recaptured before the overall foreign loss incurred during its1987 taxable year as follows: $80 ($100 x 800/1000) of X's financial servicesincome, $10 ($100 x 100/1000) of X's general limitation income, and $10($100 x 100/1000) of X's shipping income will be treated as U.S. sourceincome. The remaining $90 of X corporation's shipping income will be treatedas U.S. source income for the purpose of recapturing X's $100 overall foreignloss attributable to the shipping loss incurred in 1987. $10 remains inX's shipping overall foreign loss account for recapture in subsequent taxableyears.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>The facts are the same as in <T3>Example (1) </T3>except that X has $800 of financial services income,$100 of general limitation income, a $100 dividend from a noncontrolledsection 902 corporation and a ($100) shipping loss for its taxable yearending December 31, 1988. Pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section,the rules of section 904(f)(5) apply before recapture of overall foreignlosses. Therefore, the ($100) shipping loss incurred by X will be allocatedto its separate limitation income as follows: $80 ($100 x 800/1000) willbe allocated to X's financial services income, $10 ($100 x 100/1000) willbe allocated to its general limitation income and $10 ($100 x 100/1000)will be allocated to X's dividend from the noncontrolled section 902 corporation.Accordingly, after allocation of the 1988 shipping loss, X has $720 offinancial services income, $90 of general limitation income, and a $90dividend from its noncontrolled section 902 corporation. Pursuant to section904(f)(1), the full amount in each of X corporation's overall foreign lossaccounts is subject to recapture since $200 (the sum of those amounts)is less than 50% of X's foreign source taxable income for its 1988 taxableyear, or $450. X's overall foreign loss incurred during its 1986 taxableyear is recaptured as follows: $89 ($100 x 720/810) of X's financial servicesincome and $11 ($100 x 90/810) of its general limitation income will betreated as U.S. source income. Accordingly, after application of section904(f), X has $100 of U.S. source income, $631 of financial services income,$79 of general limitation income and a $90 dividend from its noncontrolledsection 902 corporation for its 1988 taxable year. X must establish a separatelimitation loss account for each portion of the 1988 shipping loss thatwas allocated to its financial services income, general limitation incomeand dividends from its noncontrolled section 902 corporation. X's overallforeign loss account for the 1986 general limitation loss is reduced tozero. X still has a $100 balance in its overall foreign loss account thatresulted from the 1987 shipping loss.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>Y is a domestic corporation which has a branch operationin Country Z. For its 1988 taxable year, Y has $5 of shipping income, $15of general limitation income and $100 of financial services income. Y hasa balance of $100 in its general limitation overall foreign loss accountattributable to its 1986 taxable year. Y has no other overall foreign lossaccounts. Pursuant to section 904 (f)(1), $60 of the overall foreign lossis subject to recapture since 50% of Y's foreign source income for 1988is less than the amount of its overall foreign loss for 1986. Y can demonstratethat the entire $100 overall foreign loss was attributable to a shippinglimitation loss incurred in 1986. Accordingly, only Y's $5 of shippinglimitation income received in 1988 will be treated as U.S source income.Because Y can demonstrate that the 1986 loss was entirely attributableto a shipping loss, none of Y's general limitation income or financialservices income received in 1988 will be treated as U.S. source income.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4). </T3>The facts are the same as in <T3>Example</T3> (3) except that Y can only demonstrate that $50 of the1986 overall foreign loss account was attributable to a shipping loss incurredin 1986. Accordingly, Y's $5 of shipping limitation income received in1988 will be treated as U.S. source income. The remaining $50 of the 1986overall foreign loss that Y cannot trace to a particular separate limitationwill be recaptured and treated as U.S. source income as follows: $43 ($50andmultiply; 100/115) of Y's financial services income will be treated asU.S. source income and $7 ($50 andmultiply; 15/115) of Y's general limitationincome will be treated as U.S. source income.</ITAG>(b) <T3>Treatment of overall foreign losses that are part of net operatinglosses incurred in pre-effective date taxable years which are carried forwardto post-effective date taxable years</T3>_(1) <T3>Rule.</T3> An overall foreign loss that is part of a net operatingloss incurred in a pre-effective date taxable year which is carried forward,pursuant to section 172, to a post-effective date taxable year will beallocated first to income in the category analogous to the income categoryset forth in section 904(d) as in effect for pre-effective date taxableyears in which the loss occurred. The analogous category shall be determinedunder the rules of paragraph (a) of this section. If the loss exceeds incomein the analogous income category (or categories) to which the loss is carried,the overall foreign loss shall be allocated to other foreign source income(if any) earned by the taxpayer in the carryover year in accordance withthe rules set forth in section 904(f)(5). If a loss remains after applicationof section 904(f)(5), the loss shall be allocated to U.S. source income,which will create an addition to the taxpayer's overall foreign loss account.(2) <T3>Example. </T3>The following example illustrates the rule of paragraph(b)(1).<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example. </T3>Z is a domestic corporation which has a branch operationin Country D. For its taxable year ending December 31, 1988, Z has $100of passive income and $200 of general limitation income. Z also has a $60net operating loss which was carried forward pursuant to section 172 fromits 1986 taxable year. The net operating loss resulted from an overallforeign loss attributable to a general limitation loss. Z can demonstratethat the loss is a shipping loss. Therefore, the net operating loss willbe treated as a shipping loss for Z's 1988 taxable year. Pursuant to section904(f)(5), the shipping loss will be allocated as follows: $20 ($60 andmultiply;100/300) will be allocated to Z's passive income and $40 ($60 andmultiply;200/300) will be allocated to Z's general limitation income. Accordingly,after application of section 904(f), Z has $80 of passive income and $160of general limitation income for its 1988 taxable year. Although no additionto Z's overall foreign loss account for shipping income will result fromthe NOL carryforward, shipping income earned by Z in subsequent taxableyears will be subject to recharacterization as passive income and generallimitation income pursuant to the rules set forth in section 904(f)(5).</ITAG>(c) <T3>Treatment of overall foreign losses that are part of net operatinglosses incurred in post-effective date taxable years which are carriedback to pre-effective date taxable years_</T3>(1) <T3>Allocation to analogous income category. </T3>An overall foreign lossthat is part of a net operating loss incurred by the taxpayer in a post-effectivedate taxable year which is carried back, pursuant to section 172, to apre-effective date taxable year shall be allocated first to income in thepre-effective date income category analogous to the income category setforth in section 904(d) as in effect for post-effective date taxable yearsin which the loss occurred. Except for the general limitation income category,the pre-effective date income category that is analogous to a post-effectivedate income category shall be determined under paragraphs (a) (i) through(iv) of this section. The general limitation income category for pre-effectivedate years shall be treated as the income category that is analogous tothe post-effective date categories for general limitation income, financialservices income, shipping income, dividends from each noncontrolled section902 corporation and high withholding tax interest income. If the net operatingloss resulted from separate limitation losses in more than one post-effectivedate income category and more than one loss is carried back to pre-effectivedate general limitation income, then the losses shall be allocated to thepre-effective date general limitation income based on the following formula:(2) <T3>Allocation to U.S. source income. </T3>If an overall foreign loss iscarried back to a pre-effective date taxable year and the loss exceedsthe foreign source income in the analogous category for the carryback year,the remaining loss shall be allocated against U.S. source income as setforth in andSection; 1.904(f)-3. The amount of the loss that offsets U.S.source income must be added to the taxpayer's overall foreign loss account.An addition to an overall foreign loss account resulting from the carrybackof a net operating loss incurred by a taxpayer in a post-effective datetaxable year shall be treated as having been incurred by the taxpayer inthe year in which the loss arose and shall be subject to recapture pursuantto section 904(f) as in effect for post-effective date taxable years.(3) <T3>Allocation to other separate limitation categories. </T3>To the extentthat an overall foreign loss that is carried back as part of a net operatingloss exceeds the separate limitation income to which it is allocated andthe U.S. source income of the taxpayer for the taxable year to which theloss is carried, the loss shall be allocated pro rata to other separatelimitation income of the taxpayer for the taxable year. However, thereshall be no recharacterization of separate limitation income pursuant tosection 904(f)(5) as a result of the allocation of a net operating lossto other separate limitation income of the taxpayer.(4) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraph(c)(1).<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>X is a domestic corporation which has a branch operationin Country A.

The net operating loss resultedfrom a shipping loss; X has no U.S. source income in the 1987. X had $20of general limitation income, $40 of DISC limitation income and $10 ofU.S. source income for its 1985 taxable year. The $60 NOL is allocatedfirst to X's 1985 general limitation income to the extent thereof ($20)since the general limitation income category of section 904(d) as in effectfor pre-effective date taxable years is the income category that is analogousto shipping income for post-effective date taxable years. Therefore, Xhas no general limitation income for its 1985 taxable year. Next, pursuantto section 904(f) as in effect for pre-effective date taxable years, theremaining $40 of the NOL is allocated first to X's $10 of U.S. source incomeand then to $30 of X's DISC limitation income for its 1985 taxable year.Accordingly, X has no U.S. source income and $10 of DISC limitation incomefor its 1985 taxable year after allocation of the NOL. X has a $10 balancein its shipping overall foreign loss account which is subject to recapturepursuant to section 904 (f) as in effect for post-effective date taxableyears.
