The White House said its negotiators in Geneva, responding to a Soviet concession, presented a new proposal at negotiations over an agreement to remove U.S. and Soviet short-range and intermediate-range missiles from Europe.    The administration also announced that Secretary of State George Shultz would meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in September. A White House spokesman called that meeting &quot;an optimistic sign for a summit&quot; on arms control between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.    At Geneva, the U.S. proposed to destroy its European nuclear missiles and launchers, rather than convert them into other weapons. This concession reversed a U.S. position that it could turn the Pershing 2 missiles into shorter-range, conventionally tipped Pershing 1As.    The U.S. move came in response to Moscow's decision last week to give up all of all of its European and Asian medium-range and short-range systems, including 100 medium-range missiles in Asia that the Soviets previously refused to surrender. The Soviet concession brought Moscow in line with the U.S. &quot;double zero&quot; position.    &quot;There's still much to do in Geneva, but I'm heartened that the climate is now receptive to an historic proposal of this type,&quot; Mr. Reagan said in explaining the timing of the latest American move. &quot;The United States is proud to be in a position to make this proposal.&quot;    If signed, the agreement would require the U.S. and the Soviet Union to scrap all their land-based intermediate-range missiles.    U.S. officials are frustrated, however, that West Germany is once again in the spotlight as the apparent barrier to an arms agreement, raising the possibility of new strains between Washington and Bonn. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl only reluctantly agreed this year, after a painful domestic debate, to a U.S.-Soviet plan to remove all short-range missiles from Europe, which many in Bonn fear would leave Germany more vulnerable to Soviet conventional arms superiority.    Administration officials say the 72 West German missiles have never been part of superpower negotiations because, like British and French weapons, they are independent of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Soviets argue that the German missiles are an issue because Washington controls the warheads.    The administration appears divided on the issue. In general, the Pentagon thinks Germany should keep its Pershings. But the State Department and some White House officials are willing to surrender the Pershing 1As, which they argue will be militarily obsolete anyway in five to seven years. Thus far, West German officials say they haven't been under any pressure to alter their refusal to compromise.    Edward L. Rowny, arms control adviser to the president and secretary of state, believes that if the administration can show patience, Moscow will return to its previous position of disregarding the West German missiles, which weren't even discussed during Secretary of State Shultz's last talks with Soviet officials last April in Moscow.    &quot;The U.S. position on the German missiles is very clear -- they aren't part of this negotiation as far as we are concerned,&quot; Gen. Rowny says. &quot;The Soviets said they would never go to zero in Asia. We hung tough and we're at zero in Asia. You've got to be tenacious.&quot;    A West German official argues that to surrender the Pershing 1As would further erode Bonn's confidence in American commitment. &quot;The Americans are right in sensing they have asked enough of the Germans at this time,&quot; he says. &quot;The U.S. is well-advised not to push the {Bonn} government on this matter.&quot;    American experts say that although West Germany's position on keeping and modernizing the missiles is technically sound, it mightn't be politically possible at a time when the Soviet Union is removing so many missiles from Europe.    Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher is far more willing to give them up than Chancellor Kohl. Opinion polls show most West Germans agree with Mr. Genscher, and Mr. Kohl wants to avoid looking like an impediment to arms control before Erich Honecker's September trip to West Germany, the first official visit to West Germany by an East German Communist Party leader.    &quot;Kohl doesn't want to be perceived as the man who has prevented an arms control deal between the Soviet Union and the U.S.,&quot; says Angela Stent, an expert on Soviet-West German relations at Harvard's Russian Research Center.    But West German officials hope that in the end the Soviets will give up on the Pershing 1A issue at a time when they are trying to woo instead of pressure Bonn.    Even if the Pershing issue is settled, Washington and Moscow will face tough negotiations on verifying the arms treaties. Washington wants to count the missiles before their dismantling, observe their destruction and have a challenge inspection system to ensure they aren't being produced any longer. The Soviets argue that such methods are more complex and cumbersome than necessary. </TEXT></DOC>
