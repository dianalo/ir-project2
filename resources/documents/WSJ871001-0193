In addition, Repsol's chairman, Oscar Fanjul, said he hoped to conclude by early next year negotiations with Petroleos Mexicanos under which the Mexican state oil company would take a stake of about 10% in Repsol.    The moves are part of a strategy to strengthen Repsol's commercial position prior to the opening in 1992 of the Spanish oil market to companies from elsewhere in the European Community.    Currently, Repsol uses its own production to meet about 25% of its daily refining needs of 400,000 barrels of oil. Mr. Fanjul said he wanted to raise the proportion to 50%.    As a first step, Repsol has bought for $20 million Tidewater Inc.'s 7,000-barrel-a-day share of production rights to deposits in Java and Sumatra in Indonesia. Officials said they also are examining the possibility of buying production rights in the North Sea, several Latin American countries and Gabon, Angola and Egypt. </TEXT></DOC>
