The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose 0.3% last month, or at a 4.2% compound annual rate, after increasing 0.2%, or at a 2.1% annual rate, in December.    But excluding food and energy prices, which vary widely from month to month, the index was up a surprisingly large 0.5% after rising 0.2% on the same basis in December. &quot;This is not a small increase,&quot; said Joel Popkin, a private forecaster here. &quot;The numbers are starting to show signs that inflation is going to be a problem.&quot;    The sharpest price increases occurred in services. Medical-care costs rose 0.8%, largely because of higher hospital and doctor fees. Entertainment costs were up 0.6%. Auto insurance rates rose 1.5%, the biggest increase since October 1986. Hotel and motel rates rose 3.2%. The price of tobacco products also rose, climbing 2.8%. The figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.    &quot;Services tend to be more correlated with core inflation than other components of the CPI and we don't like to see a popup there,&quot; said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University. &quot;One month doesn't make a trend . . . but those people who thought that inflation was dead are going to have to look closely. It isn't vigorous, but it is flopping around.&quot;    But Lawrence Chimerine, president of WEFA Group of Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said, &quot;The inflation scare is somewhat exaggerated.&quot; Prices of services and imports will rise this year, he said, but oil prices continue to fall and wages aren't rising substantially.    The Labor Department said energy prices fell 0.7% in January. Food prices rose 0.3% as declines in the price of meat, fresh fruit and vegetables were offset by higher prices for eggs, poultry, cereal and liquor.    Before seasonal adjustment, the consumer price index stood at 115.7% of its 1982-1984 average, up 0.3% from 115.4% in December and 4% higher than in January 1987. The department has shifted to a 1982-1984 base from its previous 1967 base. The price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers rose 0.3% in January, both before and after seasonal adjustment. Before adjustment, the index stood at 114.5% of the 1982-1984 average, up from 114.2% in December. This index, which covers about a third of the U.S. population, is used to adjust Social Security benefits.    The Commerce Department said consumer spending rose 0.3% in January to an annual rate of $3.049 trillion after climbing a revised 0.7% in December. The December increase previously was estimated at 0.5%. Consumer spending on durable and non-durable goods was nearly unchanged from December, but there was an increase in spending on services, which accounts for more than half of all consumer spending. The figures are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, but not for inflation.    &quot;Consumer spending started slowing down about a year ago,&quot; Mr. Chimerine said. &quot;That pattern is going to continue.&quot; For the economy overall, however, the slowdown in consumer spending will be offset at least in part by continued strong overseas demand for U.S. products, many economists say.    Personal income increased 0.3% to an annual rate of $3.879 trillion in January after climbing 0.7% in December. The figures were affected by several one-time factors, including a pay raise for federal employees and higher Social Security taxes in January and a retroactive payment to Postal Service workers in December. Without these, personal income rose 0.5% in January and 0.4% in December.    Savings as a percentage of after-tax personal income rose to 4.7% from a revised 4.4% in January, substantially above the 1987 annual average of 3.8%.    Separately, the Labor Department said average weekly earnings of U.S. workers rose 0.1% in January after adjusting for inflation and seasonal factors. Earnings fell a revised 1% in December.    Before inflation adjustment, average hourly earnings rose 0.4% and average weekly hours were unchanged, the department said.    Weekly earnings averaged $317.16, up from $315.77 in December after seasonal adjustment. Before adjustment, weekly earnings averaged $315.79, down from $318.29.    ---   Here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department's consumer price index for January 1988.                                           % change from                                        Dec.
