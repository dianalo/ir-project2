Wall Street speculation over the weekend focused on Unilever PLC as a logical candidate to rescue the Minneapolis-based food and restaurant company from Grand Met's $60-a-share offer.    Stephen Carnes, food analyst at Piper, Jaffray andamp; Hopwood Inc. in Minneapolis, said yesterday a counterbid probably &quot;would need to be north of $65. Using discounted dollars coming out of Europe, you might be able to do it.&quot;    Sources said that Roger Headrick, Pillsbury's chief financial officer, was in London last week. The company also announced it was retaining Kleinwort Benson Ltd. as its financial adviser in Britain on the Grand Met offer.    A Pillsbury spokesman contacted yesterday about the Unilever speculation said, &quot;I wouldn't even get close to commenting on it.&quot;    In London, a Unilever spokesman declined to comment about whether the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate might act as Pillsbury's white knight. &quot;We don't comment on matters of speculation,&quot; he said. Unilever has headquarters in both London and Rotterdam, the Netherlands.    Pillsbury has until tomorrow afternoon to reply to Grand Met's $5.32 billion offer. </TEXT></DOC>
