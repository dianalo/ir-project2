Hundreds of riot police fired tear gas and hurled rocks to driveback the protesters in the southern cities of Taegu and Kwangjuwhere dissident groups rallied in support of Moon Ik-hwan's visit,police and witnesses said.   The South Korean government has said Moon will be prosecuted ifhe returns to the south. His visit has sparked major controversy inSouth Korea, with the government charging that dissidents aretrying to undermine its authority.   Students gathered at Chonam University in Kwangju to denouncePresident Roh Tae-woo's government and demand unification. Yonhap,the South Korean news agency, said about 5,000 students took partin the protest.   Police opened fire with tear gas when the protesters attemptedto march into the streets.   About 5,000 radical students and workers attended a rally atKyemyong University in Taegu, where dissident leader Paek Ki-wansaid Moon went to North Korea to speak for farmers, workers and thepoor.   He said the Roh government was not interested in unification.   Aboput 2,000 protesters then attempted to march into the streetsand clashed with riot police blocking the way, police said.   Police in Taegu and Kwangju said they had no immediate reportsof arrests or serious injuries.   In Jinju on the southern coast, about 800 students clashed withpolice in another anti-government protest, but officials said thedemonstration was not linked to Moon's visit.   The protest came as South Korean leaders, angered by Moon'svisit, were reconsidering efforts to improve relations with thenorth. Officials have charged the north is trying to undermine theSeoul government by having independent contacts with South Koreandissidents.   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon and other government leaders metand agreed to take a ``cautious stand'' in future detente withNorth Korea, a government official said, requesting anonymity.   Yonhap quoted a ``highly-placed'' government source as sayingPresident Roh Tae-woo is considering a cabinet reshuffle to holdsecurity officials responsible for failing to stop the visit.   Moon met North Korean President Kim Il Sung Monday in Pyongyang,the communist capital.   Officials in Seoul say he will be arrested when he returnsbecause he violated South Korean law, which forbids unauthorizedcontact with North Korea.   In a related development, newspapers in Seoul reported todaythat the government may call off a scheduled visit to North Koreaby Chung Ju-yung, founder of one of South Korea's largest businessconglomerates, the Hyundai Group.   Chung was to visit Pyongyang in April for talks on jointventures with the north, which include a resort development inNorth Korea's Diamond Mountains on the east coast. He visitedPyongyang in January.   Both South and North Korean governments approved the visit.   A government official, speaking on condition of anomymity, saidSouth Korea would continue efforts to ease tension on the Koreanpeninsula and maintain limited contact with the north, butofficials were reviewing the impact of Moon's trip on theinter-Korea dialogue.   Roh's government has been trying to improve relations with thenorth to ease tension on the peninsula and broaden its trade withother communist nations.   The two Koreas technically are still at war nearly four decadesafter the Korean War ended, with their border sealed, althoughthere have been government-level talks on and off since the early1970s.</TEXT></DOC>
