Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale, which owns about 60% of Banca Commerciale, was responding to the Fed's decision last week to consider IRI a bank-holding company and require it to file a formal application with the Fed in connection with Banca Commerciale's bid. It is the first time that the Fed has applied the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act to a foreign government-owned bank.    Separately, Enrico Braggiotti, chairman of Banca Commerciale, issued a brief statement yesterday saying: &quot;We are surprised by the board's determination, which is contrary to its (previous policy) . . . We are exploring various options for proceeding ahead. Banca Commerciale remains committed to its proposed transaction with Irving.&quot;    Since April, Banca Commerciale has been locked in a battle for Irving with Bank of New York Co., which launched a hostile bid for 100% of the company nearly a year ago. With the support of Irving's management, Banca Commerciale is offering $84 in cash a share for 51% of Irving, or about $840 million. Bank of New York is offering $15 cash and 1.575 shares of its own stock for each Irving share that it doesn't already own. The offer is valued at about $1.4 billion.    Bank of New York yesterday declined to comment on IRI's statement.    It appeared yesterday that Banca Commerciale and Italian bank regulators were attempting to negotiate with the Fed on exactly what will be required of IRI.    Robert A. Falise, Irving's executive vice president for legal affairs, said yesterday that there &quot;may be some room for negotiations&quot; with the Fed. &quot;It's my understanding that Italy's central bankers are talking to the Fed about this,&quot; Mr. Falise said. A Fed spokesman said he wasn't aware of any such discussions.    Some banking industry analysts have speculated that IRI may be unwilling to meet the conditions laid down for Banca Commerciale's purchase of 51% of Irving, and that the bid might have to be withdrawn. Both Irving and Banca Commerciale spokesmen have sought to dispel that notion.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Irving closed yesterday at $66.375, up 25 cents.    In Italy, the Fed's decision to consider IRI a bank-holding company generated much surprise and some suspicion of protectionist motives. Although the Fed didn't require IRI to file an application when Banca Commerciale bought Long Island Trust Co. in 1982, the Fed at the time did express serious concerns about IRI's ownership of industrial companies. U.S. banking laws prohibit joint ownership of banks and industrial firms.    The Fed said at that time that it would have been unfair to apply the law to a foreign bank without any prior warning. But in approving the purchase, the Fed stressed that it hadn't resolved the issue.    IRI, the state-owned Italian holding company, has extensive banking and industrial interests. In addition to Banca Commerciale, it controls Banco di Roma, Credito Italiano, Banco Santo Spirito and indirectly owns the single largest stake in merchant bank Mediobanca S.p.A. But its interests in industry are even more vast. It owns more than 1,000 industrial companies, in steel, aerospace, shipbuilding, food, the state airline Alitalia, the state television network and many of Italy's autostrade, or highways.    IRI's total sales last year were 53.511 trillion lire ($38 billion), and its profits were 190 billion lire ($135 million).    In applying the law to the Italian government-owned company, the Fed offered IRI an exemption of at least three years from having to comply with the U.S. ban on joint ownership of banks and industrial firms. </TEXT></DOC>
