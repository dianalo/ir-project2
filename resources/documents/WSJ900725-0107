The accuracy of replies to inquiries on tax law improvedmarkedly last spring to about 77% from 63% in 1989's filingseason. But that isn't good enough, and the IRS has greathopes for more gains with a system that helped Boston-areaaides boost their accuracy rate to 79% from 58%. When an aidefeeds in a tax topic raised by a caller's inquiry, the systemdisplays a series of questions that prompt the aide to probefor information that will identify the exact issue and leadto the correct answer.</LP><TEXT>   It isn't clear how much of the gain in Boston was due tothis system and how much to other actions. But AssistantCommissioner Brand says the project was deemed a success andwill be extended next year to Philadelphia, Atlanta, Dallasand Los Angeles. It is to be expanded to all areas in lateryears. The system also makes it much easier to update filesof technical information for phone assisters, Brand adds.   The anticipated cost through 1994 of installing the systemthroughout the nation is $60 million.                                                                                                          ANOTHER NEW SYSTEM speeds up the not-so-simple job ofverifying names.   Until April, the 15,000 data-retrieval terminals in IRSdistrict offices and service centers didn't have directaccess to data from master files. Lacking account data inlocal files, workers couldn't immediately verify names,addresses, and Social Security numbers of people calling foraccount information. It could take weeks to correct an errorthat delayed or misdirected an IRS reply. Now a system calledOLE lets a terminal operator call up a central file andcompare ID data in seconds.   OLE is averaging 160,000 queries a day. It alsocrosschecks spouses' names and numbers. It soon will be usedin service centers to initiate fast updates of master-fileIDs. Later this year, it will be used to verify IDs onemployers' tax deposits; and ID data from third-party reportssuch as Form W-2s will be added. In 1991, the IRS plans toadd more account information from the master files to theseparate OLE files to speed up responses to inquiries.                                                                                                          RED INK TO RED CARPET: An ailing hotel welcomes a New Yorkstate refund.   A ruling in U.S. Bankruptcy Court bars the state fromapplying a 10% real-estate-gains tax to the 1989 sale of NewYork City's Stanhope Hotel under court auspices. JudgeBrozman ordered the state to refund a $2.6 million tax that995 Fifth Avenue Associates paid under protest so that itcould close the $76 million sale to Tobishima Associates ofJapan. The tax hits gains from real-estate sales exceeding $1million.   The hotel owners sought Chapter 11 protection fromcreditors in 1988 and sold the hotel under a court-approvedplan to pay debts. The gains levy would have to be paid if itwere an income tax. But the judge called it a transfer taxthat can't be imposed in Chapter 11 cases under bankruptcylaw. People selling troubled properties now must considerwhether to go through Chapter 11, says Joshua J. Angel, alawyer for the Stanhope's former owners.   New York officials say they plan to appeal the decision.                                                                                                          NO SHOESTRING STINGS here. A pending illegal-drug billwould renew through 1991 an expired law that let IRSundercover operations pay expenses with their sting incomeinstead of depositing it in the U.S. general fund. The billalso would make violation of the cash-transaction-reportinglaws a felony instead of a misdemeanor.                                                                                                          IN RE: SAUCES AND GEESE: The Boston Globe supported thenew tax package, including sales taxes on services, to trimMassachusetts's deficit. Now it is suing to challenge asection that, it says, makes newspaper publishing the onlymanufacturing industry in the state subject to sales tax onraw materials and machinery.                                                                                                          A HANDWRITTEN NOTE from his sister confirmed Brent D.Amundson's 50% interest in their home, although his namewasn't on the mortgage, the Tax Court said. It let theSunnyvale, Calif., man deduct his interest payments on themortgage.                                                                                                          LIFE-INSURANCE SELLERS may get a break on business-expensedeductions.   Self-employed people deduct expenses in full on Schedule Cof personal returns, but employees deduct unreimbursedexpenses on Schedule A only to the extent that allmiscellaneous deductions exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.Then there are &quot;statutory&quot; employees, who report income onSchedule C as the self-employed do, but fall in between fortax withholding: Employers withhold Social Security andunemployment taxes, but not income taxes, on payments tothem.   The special category includes full-time life-insurancesalespeople and certain people who do piecework at home,deliver food or laundry, or travel in sales jobs; employers'Form W-2 pay reports show this status. According to publisherResearch Institute of America, the IRS now says it will treatstatutory employees as self-employed for the purpose ofletting them deduct business expenses in full on Schedule C.   The IRS is expected to issue a statement to that effect.                                                                                                          BRIEFS: A House Government Operations panel plans ahearing today on the feasibility of a tax amnesty, which theIRS and the Treasury have opposed in the past. . . .Montana's November ballot will list a citizens'constitutional initiative to abolish all of the state's taxesand to replace them with a 1% &quot;trade charge&quot; on all businessand financial transactions.</TEXT></DOC>
