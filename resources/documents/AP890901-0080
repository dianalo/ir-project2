(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An 18-year-old who concealed her pregnancywill face trial on a charge of killing the infant she allegedlyabandoned in a trash container.   Wendi Hawes was bound over for trial Thursday by District JudgeJohn T. Connolly, who reduced the charge from an open count ofmurder to involuntary manslaughter.   Police said Hawes gave birth April 9 in her room while her motherwas in the next room unaware of the delivery, and told her mothershe had the flu when her mother asked about a noise.   ``She didn't tell her mother. She was afraid that she would loseher mother's respect,'' said Hawes' attorney, Donald Poniatowski.   Hawes told police she believed her son was born dead. Butforensic examiners said the boy was alive when left in the trash,and that he bled to death after dogs pulled him from the trash andmauled him.</TEXT></DOC>
