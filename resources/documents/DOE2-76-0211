New hardwarevendors are scrambling to produce the longest list of available applicationsfor their machines; researchers at universities and in private industryare sweating away at the programming problems presented by parallel computers;and a move to Unix is underway. And meanwhile, users and potential userseverywhere are looking over the new machines and realizing that new kindsof problems can be tackled with them due both to the plummeting costof performance and to new kinds of capabilities-most notably small, single-usersystems that combine number-crunching power with interactive graphics-orienteduser interfaces. Observers who wonder what all the new supercomputerswill be used for can rest assured: there are meaningful, profitable usesfor these machines. As the product-rollout boom in mid-range and low-endsystems proceeds, existing supercomputer users can instantly apply thenewly available computation capacity-many of them need just as much poweras their budgets will allow. New applications, as they capitalize onfalling prices, will in turn drive the market.</TEXT></DOC>
