The Machinists union, Boeing's largest representing 57,800workers around the country, struck early Wednesday after membersoverwhelmingly rejected a three-year offer that included theirfirst wage increase in six years.   The strike hits Boeing in its fifth consecutive year of recordjetliner orders. So far this year, Boeing has had orders for 736commercial jets worth $38.5 billion, boosting its order backlog to$80 billion.   The orders have pressured the company to maintain deliveryschedules, and the heavy overtime required of workers has become amajor issue in the strike.   ``When my kids found out about the strike, they said, `Oh boy,we get to see Daddy,''' said Bob Junka, who was on a picket line ata plant in Renton, south of Seattle.   No talks were scheduled, Boeing spokesman Harold Carr said thismorning. The company's operations are continuing, he said, ``butone obviously needs to recognize that we're operating without43,000 people who are normally here.''   Federal mediator Douglas Hammond said he was trying to get bothsides to resume talks soon because of the large number of workersand the potential for economic havoc with a long strike. Boeing isthe state's largest private employer and the nation's leadingexporter.   Boeing took out full-page advertisements in Seattle-areanewspapers to outline its contract offer, describing it as``substantial, providing for continued growth in compensation andbenefits.''   Members of other Boeing unions reported to work as usualWednesday, but some unionized workers for a subcontractor stayedaway from a plant in the Seattle area after unexpectedly findingpickets at the gate.   In Wichita, Kan., where 12,000 Machinists are on strike, Boeingsecured a judge's order to limit the number of pickets at plantgates and prohibit pickets from speaking in an abusive orintimidating manner to people trying to report for work.   The order was granted after pickets stopped each vehicle headedtoward the plant and attempted to persuade the occupants to honorstrike lines. Traffic delays of three hours or more were reported.No problems were reported this morning.   Two motorists were detained for questioning by Sedgwick Countysheriff's deputies after allegedly bumping people with their cars.No one was seriously injured.   In the Washington, Tom Baker, Machinists district president,went from plant to plant in the Puget Sound area and talked withpickets.   ``Everybody's spirits are high,'' the union leader said. ``Ijust tell them to keep dug in.''   ``That's what we like to see, (he's) right out here with us,''striker Blake LaLonde said of Baker.   LaLonde, 23, and his fellow pickets cheered with each honk ofsupport from passing motorists.   Boeing offered a salary hike totaling 10 percent over threeyears, plus bonus pay, but Machinists said they want more money andwere upset at having to work mandatory overtime. The proposal wouldhave cut mandatory overtime to 160 hours a quarter from 200 hours.   ``Most people we talked to were basically insulted by thecontract,'' said picket Bryce Bushby, who spoke outside Boeing'ssouth Seattle headquarters. Boeing machinists haven't gotten araise in six years, but received yearly bonuses.   Pickets marched in 45-degree weather outside the plant, wavingsigns as motorists and truck drivers honked horns.   In addition to those in the Seattle and Wichita areas, 1,700Machinists in Portland, Ore., and smaller numbers in a half-dozenother locations are on strike.   Worldwide, Boeing employs 164,000 people, including 106,000 inwestern Washington.   Binder said he didn't know how many airplanes were far enoughalong that they could be completed by supervisory personnel.   Before Boeing can deliver any airplanes completed during thestrike, the Federal Aviation Administration will require thecompany to demonstrate its compliance with an FAA-approved qualitycontrol program, KIRO-TV reported.   The FAA said it would increase on-site production surveillanceat Boeing plants during the strike.</TEXT></DOC>
