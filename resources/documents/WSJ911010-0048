The Wall StreetJournal sought the views of men and women in a variety ofoccupations and found that while the workplace is changing,sexual harassment remains a problem. But there was lessagreement on how to deal with harassment on the job. Whatfollows is a sampling of opinion.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   WHAT IS SEXUAL HARASSMENT?                                                                                                          &quot;I think that it is something that every woman has her owngauge of what that means to her. For some women it might justbe a comment or something that is said to her. For others itcould be someone coming up and touching her.   &quot;It really seems to happen more to women who are insupport positions than management. Somehow it seems thehigher up you are in the management system, the moreinsulated you are from harassment due to your position. Ialways found that for me personally it was when I was in mysecretarial position, going back 10 years ago, that I wasteased a lit tle bit, taken for granted quite a bit by myboss and I was dumped on a lot.&quot;   -- Sheri Poe,   president and chief executive,   Ryka Inc., a maker of women's athletic footwear                                                                                                          &quot;I define sexual harassment in a very broad sense. We allought to be able to come to the workplace and be in asexist-free environment. I think it becomes sexual harassmentwhen you have not given any kind of indication that that'swhat you are interested in.&quot; An example of sexual harassmentmight be a colleague after work, over a coffee or drink,beginning to talk about his wife's frigidity or maritalproblems, without any indication that the other person wasinterested in him romantically.   &quot;If someone were to speak to me about pornographic films,I would be extremely offended. If it were the first sexualadvance or comment I would deal with it one to one. If he didit in front of somebody else, I would cut him off at theknees. If you are going to degrade me in front of others, Iwon't let you get away with it. If he did it again, I wouldfile charges.&quot;   -- Jewell Jones,   commissioner,   Los Angeles County Superior Court                                                                                                          Sexual harassment extends to a boss asking an employeeout. &quot;It creates the impression that your job can be at stake-- that elevates it to the level of sexual harassment. To askout a subordinate is inappropriate.&quot; If a boss feelscompelled to date a subordinate, the boss should first findanother position within the company.   In the case of one colleague approaching another,determining what constitutes harassment is based more on thechoice of words and on how much pressure is applied to becomeinvolved. Certainly, suggestive sexual comments or leeringare harassment. But being asked out to dinner isn'tnecessarily.   -- Sally Suchil,   senior vice president,   corporate legal affairs,   MGM-Pathe Communications Co.                                                                                                          &quot;I can understand that it can be confusing for men. But ifa man wants not to be confused, it's his responsibility tocome ask. When a woman says no, everything after that Iconsider harassment.&quot;   -- Mary Gaddis,   steamfitter                                                                                                          A colleague describing a porno flick to a woman would beas &quot;tacky&quot; today as it would have been 10 years ago, &quot;whenthere were no guidelines at all for any of this stuff.&quot; It'snever clear what constitutes the difference betweenharassment and a blooming office romance. Most acquaintanceswould avoid starting a romance in the office mainly becausethey are so potentially &quot;disruptive, especially if they don'twork out,&quot; rather than out of any heightened concern aboutharassment charges.   -- Richard Howrilka,   executive vice president-trading,   Kalin Associates                                                                                                          &quot;I find it no accident that professional women are enragedabout this and the men don't seem to understand what the bigdeal is.&quot; The fact that the reactions are so different &quot;tellsus something scary&quot; about the difference in the perceptionsof men and women about what constitutes sexual harassment.   A situation of sexual harassment would need to have twoelements: The man must be in a position of greater power thanthe woman, and the action must be repeated. &quot;There's a cleardifference between something that's done in a joking mannerand something that's done and repeated after the woman makesit clear that she finds it offensive. It's the persistentnature that makes it harassment.&quot;   -- Joan A. Lipton,   director, evaluation department,   Klein Beltzer andamp; Co., accountants                                                                                                          &quot;The key word is unwelcome.&quot; But sexual relationships are&quot;never a good idea in the workplace, because what's welcometoday may become unwelcome tomorrow.&quot; Once it crosses theline from welcome to unwelcome, the conduct must stop and theemployer must investigate by talking with both parties andinformed third parties.   -- Mark S. Shiffman,   lawyer,   Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler andamp; Krupman                                                                                                          &quot;There's a line somewhere out there, and the line dependson the individual and the circumstances. If a personapproaches another person and wants a date and the womanrejects that and he continues to do things that the woman hasobjected to, there comes a point which crosses over the line.If it's the boss, the line gets crossed a lot sooner. If it'sa co-worker on equal footing, I think a woman should be ableto tolerate a little more than a person in a subservientposition because their employment is not threatened.&quot;   -- Len Beauchamp,   director of research and collective bargaining services,   the Boilermakers Union.                                                                                                          HOW WIDESPREAD IS IT?                                                                                                          &quot;Unfortunately, the current `sexual harassment' is likethe current use of `racism' and `antisemitism': It coverssuch a broad range of behaviors. It undermines what actuallyis sexual harassment. I would really have to hear both sidesof the story. It's very easy to level the charge, but thereare times when there is a legitimate grievance.   &quot;If we can make a distinction between calling someone`honey' and backing someone up against a cooler and saying`Do you want a raise?' we won't make light of or belittlewhat is true sexual harassment.   &quot;Anytime that you put men and women together, you're goingto have situations where people are going to make advances,or attempt to make connections, because usually people'slives revolve around work. There needs to be a distinctionbetween bad manners and what is illegal. We need to come upwith a better definition.&quot;   -- John W. Uhlmann,   president, Uhlmann Co.,   a food company in Kansas City, Mo.                                                                                                          &quot;It depends on the industry you work in. I've seen someimprovement in the '70s and early '80s, but then after themid-'80s, it got worse again. It seemed for the 20 steps wetook forward, we've almost taken 21 back.   &quot;In the high-tech industry, it's particularly bad. What Ifound {in a previous job} was the type of harassment wheremen would refer to women as babes, or talk in a patronizingway. The human resources manager grabbed my breast. But a lotof it was innuendo-derogatory comments. The director of humanresources and the human resources manager said &quot;that they'dlike to know what it would be like for them to have sex withme at the same time.&quot;                                                                                                          -- Karlene Betts,   a marketing communications manager                                                                                                          &quot;I believe that the workplace definitely has improved inthe last few years, due to the fact that there are so manywomen in the work force in middle and senior managementworking in collaborative ways with their male businessassociates. You have people who are on the same level. Youhave men who report to women. The work force has changed.&quot;   -- Kate Burnham,   director of investor relations,   Reebok International Ltd.                                                                                                          &quot;I've been sexually harassed every day I've spent on atrading floor. That's life in this business. That's life,period.&quot;   -- Sharon Kalin,   founder of Kalin Associates,   an institutional stock brokerage boutique                                                                                                          &quot;Without a doubt,&quot; sexual harassment has declined in theworkplace. For one thing, workers are more aware today ofwhat's acceptable. The improvement also results from a &quot;moremature&quot; work force at the plant: most employees are over 35years old.   In addition, society's view on what's acceptable seems tohave changed over the years. &quot;It's pretty clear that a lot ofthings that were done in the past could now be called sexualharassment.&quot; For example, the calendars of women wearingbathing suits and holding wrenches are no longer acceptableat the plant.   -- Mark Johnson,   a union official at a Deere andamp; Co. plant   in East Moline, Ill.                                                                                                          &quot;As a scientist, I have been in situations where peoplewho had power over my jobs were interested in me in a waythat had nothing to do with my job.&quot; But the situation wasalways dealt with privately rather than taken to higherauthorities. &quot;I once simply left my job. I didn't quit. Ijust left. At other times I have avoided exciting thesituation.&quot;   The workplace hasn't improved much in the past 10 years.&quot;It seems to me that we are stuck with disadvantages. Sexualharassment has come to be accepted as normal in the Westernworld. What do you do?&quot;   -- Polly E.C. Matzinger,   scientist,   National Institutes of Health                                                                                                          The workplace has &quot;improved dramatically&quot; over the past 10years. &quot;We males have learned how to work with professionalfemales a lot better than we knew how to 10 years ago. It'simproved because much more attention is paid to the qualityof the work and the ability of the individual as opposed towhat sex they are.&quot;   -- Eli Broad,   chairman and CEO of Broad Inc.                                                                                                          The work environment has improved in the last 10 years.&quot;People will not suffer the jokes that they would have in thepast. More people are aware of their rights. If they feeloff-color, ethnic or racial jokes are in bad taste, they aremore likely to bring it up and confront it.&quot;   People are also more aware these days of sexualharassment, particularly in light of the numerous situationsinvolving congressmen and television evange lists.   People today are calling the bluff of their bosses, too,by talking about going to the Equal Employment OpportunityCommission if threatened. &quot;All of a sudden you've got theboss running for cover.&quot;   -- Kevin Cleary,   manager, Amling's Flowerland,   a chain based in Hinsdale, Ill.                                                                                                          WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?                                                                                                          &quot;I've learned to manage&quot; instances of sexual harassment&quot;to the point where they aren't career blockers and I movepast them.&quot;   &quot;You manage the situation with dignity and professionalismand you reject the offer. You have to finesse it to the pointwhere the other person feels nonthreatened, can continueworking, and doesn't feel guilty.&quot; If the problem persists, awoman must decide whether to fight it publicly or move on toother pastures.   -- Gloria Scoby,   publisher,   Crain's Chicago Business                                                                                                          If a male colleague were sexually harassing a femalecolleague, &quot;I'd probably butt in and say, `Get the hell awayfrom her.' Isn't that what any normal guy would do?&quot;   -- Jesse Henecke,   an actor in Los Angeles                                                                                                          Obviously, construction is a male-dominated game at mylevel. We do get more and more women on sites these days. Ibelieve that individually, women who come on now as opposedto 10 years ago catch less of that kind of stuff. But withmore women on sites, you see plenty of harassment. Maybe it'snot as crude or heavyhanded as it once was, but there isstill a lot of the boys-will-be-boys mentality in thisbusiness.&quot;   -- Jeffrey Elliott,   a construction crew supervisor in Houston                                                                                                          &quot;If someone is using their position to leverage arelationship, you start to cross the line. If overturescontinue where there clearly isn't any interest, then youcross the line. Every individual sees the line in a differentplace, so everyone needs to recognize that people's tolerancefor overtures varies a great deal. It's incumbent upon theperson making the overture to err on the side of caution.It's also important that the person receiving the overturegive the person asking some feedback.&quot;   -- Pat Farrell,   regional director,   Cradlerock Outdoor Network Inc., a consulting firm                                                                                                          I would tell {a fellow worker} that during business hoursthis is a professional place, and you don't do something likethat if it involves the customers or the business. If hedidn't listen, then someone has to go.   &quot;It's when it becomes personal -- when a woman says I'mmarried -- and they rub against her anyway. Men are going totake as much liberty as you give them, and you have to cut itoff somewhere. My wife works in an all-male butcher shop andthey go over the border sometimes, and she lets them know.When she says it's harassment, they shut up because theydon't want a lawsuit.&quot;   -- John Hernan,   a San Francisco barber</TEXT></DOC>
