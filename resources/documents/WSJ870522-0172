What is not yet obvious are the high stakes for Congress as an institution. There is a hidden constitutional trap for Congress in these hearings that it is almost obligated to walk into.    Congress's essential constitutional mandate is to formulate and maintain a sensible fiscal policy. Our Constitution gives Congress, and Congress alone, the power to raise and spend our tax dollars. The president is charged with the fundamental responsibility of conducting our relations with foreign governments. In matters of national security, the framers of the Constitution knew that an effective and sustaining government needed to speak with a single voice. As such, the president, and the president alone, is given the position as commander in chief of the Armed Forces.    The substantive case against Lt. Col. North and others within the Reagan administration will depend almost exclusively on the Boland amendment. By its principle, the Boland amendment places limits on the president in pursuing his foreign policy and national-security agenda with respect to Nicaragua. Many legal experts, conservative and liberal alike, consider this legislation as patently unconstitutional if it is to be used as anything more than an anti-appropriations bill. Further, most feel that it warrants a well-justified constitutional challenge as it could be applied in indicting Reagan administration officials involved in orchestrating the Contra funding.    If there is even one indictment in this case based on the Boland legislation, the subsequent appeal almost certainly will result in a Supreme Court ruling. At that point the outcome of the hearings, which Congress has sought to control within its own domain, will take a dramatic turn. The focus of the debate will shift away from individuals, personalities and events to a constitutional focus on the limits of congressional authority and power in establishing U.S. foreign policy. Lt. Col. North will be replaced on the &quot;hot seat&quot; by the institution of Congress. If such does happen, Congress has a great deal to lose as a governing institution-power.    The current congressional hearings might prove in the end to be one of the great ironies of modern political times. Congress, in its attempt to exert further control in the foreign-policy arena, might very well be forcing an issue that will ultimately strip away much, if not all, of its current ability to dictate to the president on such policy matters.
