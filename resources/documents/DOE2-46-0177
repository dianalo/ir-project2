Correspondinganalyses of environmentally polluting types of energy sources show theimpact of natural gas to be very slight, that of petroleum to be moderate,and coal to be considerable. As to non-polluting properties, only solarheating is superior to gas heating. The paper describes in detail howthe use of gas-heated special boilers optimized for NO/sub x/ can contributetowards environmental protection, and what construction measures areneeded to do so. The mechanism of NO/sub x/ formation is dealt with (thermicnitrogen oxide, nitrogen oxide formed due to nitrogen being present asan organic component in fuel, and primary nitrogen oxide), as well asthe parameters on which the NO/sub x/ emission factor depends. Theseare: burner and plant design, adjustment of the burner respectively theplant, and the rated capacity of the plant. The non-pollution ratingof gas-heated special boilers optimized for NO/sub x/ (rate of annualutilization: up to 93%) is up to 63% higher than for older heating systems.(HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
