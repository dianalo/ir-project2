House Democrats proved to be deeply divided on the issue during a caucus on the subject yesterday. And Republicans on the tax-writing panel, after meeting with Rep. Rostenkowski, declined to back away from a separate plan that would reduce the capital-gains tax rate.    As a result, the Illinois Democrat said there was only a &quot;slight chance&quot; he will reconvene the committee before the House is scheduled to adjourn tomorrow for a month-long break. Negotiations are expected to continue behind closed doors, however.    Rep. Rostenkowski's proposal would remove from taxation that part of a gain that is attributable to inflation. This inflation indexing would apply to assets acquired after July 31 and held for a year or more.    After five years, taxpayers would have another, novel option. For assets sold after five to 10 years, the taxable gain, as an alternative to inflation adjustment, could be 75% of the price at which the asset is sold. After 10 years, the taxable gain could be 50% of the sale price.    The alternative would be attractive to taxpayers with particularly large gains.    Assets covered by the Rostenkowski plan include corporate stock, real estate, timber and tangible assets used in a trade or business. It wouldn't cover collectibles, preferred stock, stock of foreign corporations and bonds and debt instruments.    Rep. Rostenkowski didn't present his proposal in detail to the caucus but indicated that he hoped to negotiate a compromise. The difficulty of finding a middle ground was underscored by the diversity of opinion expressed by his colleagues in the lengthy, closed session.    Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) presented the leadership's position, which is to strongly oppose a cut in the capital-gains tax rate on the ground that a cut would lose revenue over time and would disproportionately benefit the rich. But he backed away from earlier assertions by leading Democrats that opposition to the cut was a keystone position for the Democratic Party. Advocates of the cut saw this statement as an indication that he feared their proposal would prevail with strong Democratic support if the issue came to a vote in the House.    A plan that would cut the top capital-gains tax rate, which currently is as high as 33%, has been proposed by Democratic Rep. Edgar Jenkins of Georgia. Backed by President Bush, Mr. Jenkins is among six Democrats and 13 Republicans who now hold a one-vote majority in the Ways and Means Committee.    Rep. Rostenkowski tried to interest the Republicans on his committee in his inflation-related capital-gains plan. But the GOP lawmakers said they were sticking with the Jenkins plan, at least for now. &quot;There are a lot of objections to it,&quot; Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the committee's senior Republican, said of the chairman's proposal. &quot;It's clearly not something we want to reach out and grab.&quot;    Mr. Archer said that more negotiation is needed, particularly since the Bush administration hasn't embraced the Rostenkowski plan.    But late yesterday afternoon, the committee Republicans met with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House Budget Director Richard Darman, and lawmakers came away thinking that a compromise, eventually, was possible, with indexing as its base. &quot;There was a desire to work with the chairman on something that everybody can accept,&quot; said Rep. Rod Chandler (R., Wash.). </TEXT></DOC>
