SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   American women still do most of the cooking,laundering and housecleaning, but men have accepted an increasedshare of other household chores such as pet care, gardening anddealing with bills, a university study shows.   Overall, American women do two hours of housework for every onehour put in by a man, according to the report by sociologist John P.Robinson of the University of Maryland.   Robinson's findings, based on his 1985 survey of 5,000 men andwomen, compare to earlier, similar studies at the University ofMichigan which said that women performed a 3-to-1 share of houseworkin 1975 and nearly 6 to 1 in 1965.   All three analyses found four primarily female tasks _ cookingmeals, cleaning up after meals, housecleaning and laundry.   Men dominated two areas, yard work and home repairs, Robinsonfound.   And two areas where women previously did the majority of the work_ physically dealing with bills and the combined category ofgardening and pet care _ were about evenly divided in the mostrecent report.   ``Several important trends account for shifts in who does howmuch housework,'' Robinson said. These include declines in the shareof households with children, a smaller share of married-couplehouseholds and the increasing number of women in the paid workforce.   Robinson's study is reported in the December edition of AmericanDemographics magazine, which concentrates on population andstatistics issues.   In 1985, Robinson found, men averaged 9.8 hours of houseworkweekly, while women put in 19.5 hours.   The 1975 study found men working 7.0 hours a week on home taskscompared to 21.7 hours for women.   And a decade earlier, men spent 4.6 hours a week on housework,compared to 27.0 hours for women.   But despite the increasing male share of the load, men and womenstill tended to observe traditional separations of tasks. Forexample, in 1965 some 98 percent of washing and ironing was done bywomen, while by 1985 that was only down to 88 percent. Women did 87percent of cooking in 1965, and 77 percent in 1985.   On the other hand, men did only 32 percent of the bill-payingchores in 1965 but increased their share to 52 percent by 1985.   And men did 53 percent of the gardening and pet care in 1985, upfrom 33 percent two decades earlier.   Women with children under age 5 averaged 22.5 hours of houseworkweekly in 1985, compared to 19.9 hours for women with children overage 5 and 17.9 hours for childless women. All three figures are downfrom prior years.   The studies show that getting married in 1965 increased a woman'shousework time from 15.5 hours weekly to 31.6 hours. Men, on theother hand, eased their burden a bit, averaging 4.7 hours whensingle and only 4.5 hours after getting married.   By 1985, marriage increased the housework for women from 14.9hours to 22.4 hours, while men worked 7.9 hours on housework whensingle and 11.1 hours after getting married.   In 1965 a housewife averaged 34 hours of housework a week,compared to 17.8 hours for women with paid jobs. By 1985 that haddeclined to 23.6 hours for the women at home and 14.7 hours forthose with jobs.</TEXT></DOC>
