The ACLU filed its request Tuesday in Pittsburgh after BlairCounty Judge Norm Calan ruled in Altoona in favor of the woman'sboyfriend.   Marion Damick, associate director of the ACLU in Pittsburgh, saidWednesday the organization will represent the woman in arguing thatCalan overstepped the law Monday in issuing the preliminaryinjunction.   Calan said he the abortion laws unsettled and he preferred to erron the side of the fetus.   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that states cannot givehusbands veto power over their pregnant wives' decisions to haveabortions, and lower courts have applied the ruling to unmarriedcouples.   In keeping with the Supreme Court ruling, Pennsylvania has no lawto support Calan's ruling, according to the ACLU and the NationalAbortion Rights Action League.</TEXT></DOC>
