Despite the gains, traders described the currency market as indecisive and cautious. &quot;You're not seeing massive positions in the market being taken by professionals and big speculative players,&quot; said Richard Witten, a vice president at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;The mood is one of indecision.&quot;    In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.8150 West German marks from 1.8008 marks the day before. The unit also increased to 152.75 yen from 152.60 yen. The British pound fell to $1.5225 from $1.5275.    &quot;The figures which came out (on Tuesday) gave the dollar a little bit of support,&quot; said Axel Illenseer, a vice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in London. &quot;People are reassessing the statistics and want to see if the trend will continue or not. If it continues, you will see a higher dollar.&quot;    U.S. employment data for January are scheduled to be released tomorrow. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that its composite index of leading indicators rose 2.1% in December and that new factory orders climbed 1.2% in the same month. It also said sales of new single-family houses rose 12.7% in December. All the figures were higher than expected.    Those announcements came on top of Friday's Commerce Department report that December's trade deficit had narrowed to $10.66 billion, the smallest gap in 21 months.    On Tuesday, the economic statistics helped move the dollar off its intraday lows but were unable to boost it above Monday's late New York quotes.    But &quot;the attitude in the market has changed slightly. There are a few optimists around who feel that the dollar has come down enough,&quot; said Roberto Bianchi, a vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich. &quot;I agree that maybe we've seen the lows for a few weeks.&quot; He predicted the dollar will trade between 1.80 and 1.90 marks and 1.50 and 1.60 Swiss francs for the next two weeks.    Even so, Mr. Illenseer warned that &quot;the market is still cautious.&quot; He and Mr. Witten expect a 1.80-to-1.83 mark trading range for the next two days, and Mr. Illenseer saw the dollar's topside potential as 1.85 marks unless future U.S. economic data confirm the current positive trend. &quot;If so, we could see the dollar in the 1.90 (mark) range again,&quot; he said.    The dollar also received support from West German economic statistics that indicate the German economy may be less healthy than some analysts have thought. The Federal Statistics Office reported that unemployment jumped to 10% of the labor force in January from 8.9% in December, and that industrial production fell 1% in December. The statistics agency also said consumer prices rose 0.4% in January, after declining throughout most of last year.    Despite a lack of hard evidence, traders increasingly believe that senior Western monetary and finance officials from the so-called Group of Five -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France -- are preparing to meet to address exchange-rate volatility and the dollar's 10.2% plunge against the mark -- Europe's benchmark currency -- since mid-December.    Japanese press reports quoted central bank sources as saying that the Bank of Japan is trying to convene a Group of Five meeting. Also, traders noted reports that representatives of the Group of Seven nations -- G-5 plus Italy and Canada -- would meet in Florence, Italy, this week. Even though the meeting is to prepare for the nations' annual summit, to be held this year in June in Venice, and reportedly has nothing to do with specific monetary issues, traders remained wary of steps that could be taken to stabilize the dollar.    &quot;The market is in a state of indecision because there is a looming event that will dramatically affect the market -- that is the G-5 meeting,&quot; said Mr. Witten of Goldman, Sachs. &quot;The feeling is that if there is a meeting, it will result in some kind of agreement.&quot;    He and others noted that several recent pronouncements by senior monetary and finance officials that expressed satisfaction with the dollar's level had lacked teeth when challenged by the market.    Also, Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa speaking at a televised session of the Japanese parliament's upper house, yesterday called currency speculation &quot;unpardonable&quot; and said he was determined to fight it.    In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar stood at 152.75 yen, unchanged from New York yesterday afternoon.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for delivery this month settled at $402.70 an ounce, down 90 cents. Estimated volume was a moderate 2.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $402.55 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                      CURRENCY RATES                       New York     Home Mkt.
