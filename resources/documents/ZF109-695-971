 But worse is yetto come.andM;Reversing its earlier prediction of a profitable fourth quarter, thecompany's biggest in any year and, hence, the most likely to yield positiveresults, management in late October signaled the likelihood of a loss for theperiod.andM;Inevitably, for the full year of 1990 Unisys will report another major loss.andO;Ironically, the 1989 loss, incurred through major write-offs, was designed toposition the company for a profitable 1990.andM;As to prospects for 1991, in the recessionary environment emerging here andin Europe Unisys will find it very difficult to do better than break even, ifthat.andP;  The company recently announced layoffs of 5,000 more employees, on topof the 10,000-employee reduction begun in late 1989.andM;Unisys is a major federal contractor supplying general-purpose computersystems and services, as well as specialized aerospace and defense systems.andO;IRM executives and contracting officers are concerned and must assess thebeleaguered company's financial viability, if not its survival prospects.andM;Inevitably, observers are asking what went wrong and what are the lessons tobe learned.andM;Time's Running OutandM;Experienced executives who grew up in the computer industry knew severalyears ago that time was running out for the suppliers of non-IBM-compatiblesystem architectures, except probably Digital Equipment Corp.'s VAX design.andM;They understood that irresistible technological forces, such asmicroprocessor-driven, distributed systems, would encroach seriously on themarket for large host-based, hierarchical designs.andP;  Under thesecircumstances, the traditional economies of scale in manufacturing no longerwould work out as well as they once did.andM;The base economic case for the Burroughs/Sperry merger into Unisys was thatdeveloping, manufacturing and marketing two separate, non-IBM-compatiblemainframe architectures would increase production volumes on certain systemcomponents.andP;  But in the changing technological environment, this reasoningwas flawed from the beginning.andM;Compounding the miscalculation, to finance the acquisition Burroughs burdenedUnisys with a multibillion-dollar debt.andP;  It pushed the new company'sdebt-to-capital ratio to 55 percent, well above the industry average.andM;Of course, management had a game plan that would reduce the bloated debt --which stood at $4 billion at the end of 1990's third quarter -- to moreacceptable levels.andP;  Cost savings made possible by the merger and higherrevenues after the first year, stemming from the expected acceptance ofbeefed-up product lines, would yield enhanced cash flows and allow for payingdown the debt.andM;Alas, management did not deliver on either of these two hoped-for factors.andO;After an initial spurt of cost reductions and efficiency-inducing moves, amore laissez-faire attitude became apparent.andM;The anticipated positive market response to Unisys, the power of 2,materialized only marginally.andP;  At the same time, beginning in 1988, U.S.andO;demand for computers, especially non-IBM mainframes, slowed significantly.andM;Furthermore, in moves that conservative observers questioned, the companyproceeded with costly and risky acquisitions of Memorex (since sold),Convergent Technology and Timeplex Inc.andP;  As a result, debt levels haveremained too high.andP;  Interest running at more than $1 million a day is a heavyburden.andM;In light of the recent downgrading of Unisys' credit rating by the two majorratings services, these expenses may become even more of a drag on earnings,unless Unisys succeeds in selling off certain assets and portions of itsdefense business.andM;Last, but not least, to escape from the dead end represented by adherence toproprietary architectures, Unisys has pursued distributed data processingbased on standard Unix platforms.andP;  Although successful by some measures, thisstrategy so far has yielded no profits.andM;By comparison, NCR Corp., which has followed a similar open-systemsphilosophy with microprocessor-based products, has had no problem milkingprofits from its well-executed business plans.andM;What Lies AheadandM;Voices are being heard in the land wondering if Unisys will be acquired, willseek protection from its creditors in Chapter 11 bankruptcy or can continueto go it alone.andP;  With a current market capitalization (price per sharemultiplied by number of shares outstanding) of only about $400 million on $10billion of sales, Unisys may be of speculative interest to one of the band ofcorporate raiders.andM;But most computer companies will be reluctant to bite into this one, giventhe problems facing vendors of large systems based on proprietaryarchitectures, such as Groupe Bull and Siemens-Nixdorf.andM;Determined to fight on as is, Unisys denies it faces a liquidity crunch.andO;With $300 million in cash on hand, proceeds from planned asset sales, and thesavings from the discontinued dividend on the common stock, it looks as ifUnisys will be viable, at least for a while.andM;The fly in the ointment is the likelihood that the computer business inEurope is slowing markedly.andP;  Britain, the most important European country forUnisys in terms of revenue, is in recession.andP;  Until this year, Europeandemand in the face of soft conditions in the United States bailed out mostmultinational systems vendors, including Unisys.andM;If in 1991 the United States goes into a fairly sustained recession andEuropean demand remains sluggish, all bets are off.andP;  Still, Unisys can shrinkits product line, exit some market niches where it is unlikely to playcompetitive catch-up, and further streamline its unwieldy organization,making further personnel cuts.andM;If such always-unpleasant actions are taken soon, Unisys should be able toremain independent and financially viable, barring a deep worldwiderecession.andM;Ulric Weil is president of Weil andamp; Associates, a Washington consulting firm.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
