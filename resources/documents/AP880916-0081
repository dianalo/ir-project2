BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists trying to get to the root of America'sozone pollution should reconsider the role trees play, researcherssay.   Trees contribute such a high amount of hydrocarbons to theatmosphere, pollution-control efforts would be more effective ifthey sought to limit nitrogen oxide instead, according to researchby Georgia Tech faculty members.   Aware of Ronald Reagan's ``killer trees'' theories of 1980,Georgia Tech geophysicist W.L. Chameides hastens to say that treesdon't cause ozone pollution any more than the sun does.   Chameides concedes the conclusions place him and his colleaguesout on a scientific limb, but said Thursday, ``I think there areother scientists that are coming along with us.''   He said he expected that the conclusions would be accepted,despite what he called ``institutional inertia.''   Ozone is produced by the combination of sunlight, hydrocarbonsand nitrogen oxides. It protects the Earth from harmful radiationat high atmospheric levels, but can harm humans and crops at lowlevels.   All three ingredients must exist before ozone can be formed, and``no one has inferred from that that the sun was a polluter or thatwe should put a big screen over the United States to protect it,''Chameides said.   During the 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan angeredenvironmentalists by suggesting that trees and other parts ofnature were the chief culprits of air pollution. The idea led tojokes about ``killer trees'' and the appearance of protesters whodressed themselves as trees and carried signs saying, ``Chop UsDown Before We Kill Again.''   Chameides stressed that the researchers do not suggest cuttingdown trees, but instead believe pollution control efforts shouldcenter on nitrogen oxides, which are produced by many of the sameprocesses that emit hydrocarbons.   Chameides led a team of Georgia Tech researchers who studied theproduction of hydrocarbons, or hydrogen-carbon compounds, inAtlanta, a heavily wooded city that frequently fails to meetfederal air-quality standards.   The study found that vegetation, principally trees, emit as manyhydrocarbons as cars and factories, and on a hot day can provideenough hydrocarbons on their own to form illegal levels of ozone.   Published in today's edition of Science magazine, the study saysthe Environmental Protection Agency's decision to attack ozonethrough limiting hydrocarbons is therefore doomed to failure.   The Clean Air Act has sought to limit ozone through devices oncars and in factories that reduce the emission of hydrocarbons,paying little attention to nitrogen oxide, Chameides said.   ``We've pursued the hydrocarbon strategy for about 10 years orso, and I think it's pretty clear that for some reason we have notbeen successful,'' Chameides said. ``We need to re-evaluate whatwe're doing instead of continuing down the same garden path.''   EPA spokesman Chris Rice agreed that air-quality rules have notsucceeded in reducing ozone levels significantly. But he said, ``Weestimate that in the absence of control programs, (hydrocarbonlevels) would be close to 80 percent higher than they actually are.We've basically treaded water in the '80s.''   During the creation of ozone, natural hydrocarbons are used upfaster than man-made hydrocarbons ``and thus can have a significanteffect in spite of their low concentrations,'' the study says.   Chameides said his findings ``should be viewed cautiously,'' buthe added, ``Just because there are some uncertainties, you don'tignore a source of 50 percent of hydrocarbons. We've got to includeall of the scientific evidence that's available.''   He said he is anxious for other scientists to check his work andfor research to be conducted in other cities.</TEXT></DOC>
