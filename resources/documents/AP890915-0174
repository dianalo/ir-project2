Perez Prado, born in Matanzas, Cuba, died Thursday at his home ina Mexico City suburb after a long illness. The 72-year-old musiciansuffered a cerebral hemorrhage in July.   He was remembered Friday for popularizing the Caribbean musicknown as mambo in the 1940s and 1950s with his musical performancesand film appearances.   Musicologists consider him a founder of the mambo and itssyncopated beat. The mambo dance, which features lots of hip motion,is similar to the cha-cha.   But fans know him simply as the ``king of mambo'' and ``sealface,'' a name he earned for the trademark barking sound he madeduring his songs.   In his front-page essay in the Mexico City daily La Jornada,Garcia Marquez, a Colombian winner of the Nobel literature prize,said, ``Maestro Perez Prado leaped out of anonymity overnight.''   He said Perez Prado had ``discovered how to string together allthe sounds of urban life with a saxophone.''   A homage to Perez Prado has been running at the Teatro Blanquitain Mexico City for the last week, starring people he worked with.Among them have been singer Maria Victoria and dancer YolandaMontes, known as ``Tongolele.''   ``This homage is for him, in the most sorrowful moment, but heshould feel happy because the whole world loved him. We will keeplistening and dancing to his music,'' Tongolele said after his deathwas announced Thursday night.   Perez Prado studied classical music as a youth. However, he movedto Mexico after World War II and achieved world fame with themambo's sexy sound.   By 1947, he was already well-known in Mexico, where he joined anorchestra called the ``Beach Casino.''   He eventually acted in dozens of movies. The Italian filmdirector Federico Fellini helped make him famous in Europe when heincluded the mambo ``Patricia'' in the celebrated film, ``La DolceVita.''   Perez Prado recorded hundreds of records, including such songs as``How Fine Is the Mambo,'' ``Mambo No. 8,'' ``Lupita,'' ``PinkCherry,'' ``The Black Horse,'' ``The Popoff Girl'' and ``MariaChristina.''   After World War II, the mambo craze swept New York, Chicago, andother American cities.   However, when the fever finally cooled, Perez Prado tried tochange his style. His ardent fans, though, pressured him to keepchurning out the same kind of music that made his famous.</TEXT></DOC>
