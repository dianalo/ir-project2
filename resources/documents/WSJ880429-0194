This issue is too complex to paint in such absolute terms.    Crop Genetics has engineered a microbe called Cxc, which lives inside plant tissues, to contain a gene for a natural toxin. This toxin, from a bacterium called Bt, is specific to caterpillars. Crop Genetics hopes that the engineered microbe, Cxc/Bt, will provide an alternative to the chemical pesticides used against European corn borers. In laboratory tests, Cxc/Bt slows the growth of corn borers but doesn't kill them.    Crop Genetics' proposed small-scale field trials pose low environmental risks. Cxc/Bt survives poorly outside of plant tissue, and Crop Genetics will take steps to minimize its spread. Cxc/Bt has two characteristics that are likely, however, to make it undesirable for large-scale use. First, farm tools can spread Cxc to other plant species. Widescale use could spread Cxc/Bt to wild and weedy plants, causing them to become toxic to insects and disrupt ecosystems. Second, Cxc is a mild plant pathogen and can depress corn yields. As we noted in comments to the Environmental Protection Agency, Crop Genetics probably could choose a better vector than Cxc for the Bt toxin gene.    We welcome new methods of biological control. But such developments must be based on careful ecological analysis -- particularly because biological pesticides, unlike chemical ones, can reproduce.
