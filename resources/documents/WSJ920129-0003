In his third State of the Union address, Mr. Bushannounced a series of steps that built upon nuclearreductions he unveiled in September. His new proposals wouldend production of the B-2 bomber once 20 of the radar-evadingplanes are built; halt production of new warheads forsea-based nuclear missiles; stop new production of 10-warheadMX Peacekeeper missiles and kill the Air Force's smaller,single-warhead Midgetman missile; and end purchases ofadditional advanced cruise missiles.</LP><TEXT>   And in a move that would permanently change the characterof U.S. and East European nuclear forces, Mr. Bush said hehas proposed to Russia and the other former Soviet republicsthat all sides' land-based multiple-warhead nuclear missilesbe eliminated. He described the early response from RussianPresident Boris Yeltsin -- who is scheduled to visit with Mr.Bush at Camp David this weekend -- as &quot;very positive.&quot;   &quot;By the grace of God, America won the Cold War,&quot; Mr. Bushtold members of Congress who packed the House chamber. &quot;Thereare still threats. But the long, drawn-out dread is over.&quot;   Crediting U.S. taxpayers for bearing &quot;the brunt of theburden&quot; in defeating communism, the president offered back &quot;ahunk of the glory&quot; -- and $50 billion in cuts from projectedPentagon spending over the next five years to be devoted todeficit reduction, helping free up other revenues fordomestic programs. At the same time, Mr. Bush warnedcongressional Democrats that he would fight additionalreductions in the Pentagon budget, which totals $291 billionin the year that began Oct. 1, and specifically what remainsof the Strategic Defense Initiative.   &quot;This deep, and no deeper,&quot; Mr. Bush declared. &quot;We mustnot go back to the days of the hollow army . . . For theworld is still a dangerous place. Only the dead have seen theend of conflict.&quot;   By invoking U.S. foreign policy triumphs, which consumedthe first third of Mr. Bush's remarks, the president remindedAmericans of his strong suit and set the stage for thesoaring rhetoric in which he enveloped his domestic program.&quot;We are going to lift this nation out of hard times inch byinch and day by day, and those who would stop us had betterstep aside,&quot; Mr. Bush pledged near the end of his speech. Inaddressing U.S. current problems, he repeated his vow toexpel Saddam Hussein's army from Kuwait a year ago: &quot;Thiswill not stand.&quot;   But for all his display of determination, Mr. Bush facedradically different political circumstances than in his twoprevious State of the Union speeches. In January 1990, onemonth after the invasion of Panama that toppled ManuelNoriega, the president's public approval rating topped 70%. Ayear later, amid his leadership of the one-sided Persian GulfWar, Mr. Bush's popularity was near 80%. Foreign affairsdominated both speeches, and the Democratic response wasmuted.   Yesterday, with the spotlight fixed on domestic problems,the White House in turmoil, and the president's popularitysagging at around 50%, an increasingly assertive Democraticmajority was maneuvering for advantage even before thepresident spoke.   The House Ways and Means Committee approved another13-week extension of federal benefits for jobless workers, anaction Mr. Bush opposed vehemently last year but nowsupports. And Senate Democrats fired a warning shot ofpartisan brawls to come with an amendment aimed at shiftingdefense funds to domestic programs. The proposal fromColorado Sen. Timothy Wirth was non-binding and lost 53-45,but that margin was much closer than votes on similarproposals late last year, indicating further erosion ofsupport for the 1990 budget agreement that Mr. Bush continuesto support.   Hoping to build public backing, Mr. Bush and his aides inrecent days selectively released the good news portions ofthe administration budget that might otherwise get lost inthe focus on economic policy: increases in funding for theHead Start preschool education program, a space station,anti-drug efforts and environmental cleanup. But for other&quot;discretionary&quot; domestic programs -- which doesn't includeso-called entitlement programs like Social Security andMedicare -- Mr. Bush in his speech proposed a budget freezewhile calling for elimination of some 246 unspecifiedprograms.   &quot;It's time we discovered a home truth the American peoplehave never forgotten: This government is too big and spendstoo much,&quot; Mr. Bush said. He reiterated his past requests --which lawmakers have repeatedly rejected -- for authority toveto individual line items in legislation passed by Congress.   Mr. Bush demanded that Congress pass his domestic programby March 20 and urged Democrats not to &quot;put their party'sfortunes before the public good&quot; in this election year. Butseveral of the domestic initiatives Mr. Bush discussed arelikely to receive an indifferent reception.   The president called on the country &quot;to revolutionizeAmerica's schools,&quot; and said his education plan &quot;will giveparents more choice, give teachers more flexibility, and helpcommunities create new American schools.&quot; But a few hoursearlier, the Senate, in a 92-6 vote, approved an educationbill that largely rejects the main tenets of the White Houseapproach.   Mr. Bush repeated his demand that Congress pass hisanti-crime legislation. The legislation, which has consumedthousands of hours of debate in recent years, would expandthe federal death penalty and increase mandatory prison termsfor violent crime. Various versions have passed at differenttimes, but the overall legislation has repeatedly failedbecause of objections from members of both parties. Ininterviews, officials of Mr. Bush's own Justice Departmentexpressed disappointment that the anti-crime portion of thespeech contained so few initiatives.   To combat the breakup of families in the inner city, Mr.Bush announced that he would create a Commission on America'sUrban Families at the request of a group of mayors with whomhe met recently. Co-chairing the commission will be MissouriGov. John Ashcroft and former Dallas Mayor Annette Strauss.   Echoing a theme that is increasingly popular in stategovernments, Mr. Bush said he would move to &quot;reform thewelfare system&quot; by making &quot;able-bodied&quot; welfare recipients&quot;seek work, education or job training.&quot; Mr. Bush promised tohelp state governments revamp the welfare system by making iteasier for them to waive certain federal regulationsgoverning welfare.   The president also called on Congress to fund fully ahousing program that would &quot;empower the poor&quot; by allowingthem to purchase public housing. But the administration's $1billion request for this program is considered likely to bewhittled down considerably by Congress, which in the past hasbeen reluctant to allocate scarce housing dollars to theinitiative.   In the nationally televised Democratic response, HouseSpeaker Thomas Foley pledged to seek common ground with theadministration, but also underscored the importance of hisparty's principles and the need for change in a post-Cold Warworld. &quot;The old ways of thinking and leading will not do,&quot;the Washington state Democrat said.   Hoping to deter Republicans from using such divisivecampaign issues as racial quotas, Mr. Foley spoke strongly ofcivil rights and declared that &quot;appeals to race should haveno place in our politics or our national life.&quot; He invokedanother social issue -- abortion -- that could give Democratsan election-year boost and that Mr. Bush didn't mention inhis remarks.   &quot;We will stand -- and we will fight -- for a woman's rightto choose,&quot; Mr. Foley vowed. &quot;If the Supreme Court removesthe guarantee of choice from the Constitution of the UnitedStates, this Congress will write it into the laws of theUnited States.&quot;   Mr. Bush's defense initiatives, as expected, seek to savean additional $50 billion over five years, primarily bycutting weapons development and procurement. The moves areexpected to save only about $1 billion in fiscal 1993,however, and Congress has been looking at some of the movesfor some time.   By contrast, Mr. Bush made it clear that the U.S. won'teliminate the current MX arsenal or slash warheads onsubmarine-based missiles unless the other side agrees todrastic reductions in its most potent, multiple-warheadmissiles. On the U.S. side, Mr. Bush is offering to eliminatethe new arsenal of 50 MX missiles, each of which has 10warheads. And the U.S. would also remove two of the threewarheads on each of the nation's 500 Minuteman 3 missiles.   But the cuts would have to be even deeper on the Russianside, which probably has to eliminate or reduce to a singlewarhead its force of SS-18 and SS-24 missiles. The formerSoviet Union always depended more heavily than did the U.S.on big land-based missiles.   To compensate for the deeper Russian cuts on land, Mr.Bush also offered to cut the number of warheads on U.S.sea-based missiles by a third. But Mr. Bush didn't offer toeliminate all multiple-warhead missiles based on U.S.submarines. And without being specific, Mr. Bush said that hewould &quot;convert a substantial portion &quot; of U.S. nuclearbombers to conventional use.   ---   Gerald F.
