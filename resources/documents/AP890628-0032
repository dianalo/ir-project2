Dan Glickman, D-Kan., said Tuesdayas the House approved the measure 368-47.   The bill would have the Justice Department count the crimes ofhomicide, assault, robbery, burglary, theft, arson, vandalism,trespassing, threats and others the department deems appropriate ifthey have an element of bigotry against the victims.   The House has approved similar bills three times before but theSenate has not followed suit. Hate-crime legislation cleared theSenate Judiciary Committee on March 9, however, and supporters arehoping for a floor vote.   Annual nationwide crime statistics already are published by theFBI, but the data is not broken down to reflect crimes involvingbigotry.   Supporters of the bill say it could help combat a growing wave ofhate crimes across the nation. ``This legislation is an opportunityto begin the counterattack against crimes based on hate,'' said Rep.Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y.   ``The more we know about crimes of hate the more chance we haveof preventing them,'' said Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly, D-Conn.   Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., said 1,281 anti-Semitic acts werereported by the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith in 1988.He said the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force reported 7,008 actsof anti-homosexual violence in 1987. ``There is also evidence ofgrowing (Ku Klux) Klan, neo-Nazi, skinhead and other hate-groupactivity,'' Green said.   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that gathering suchdata could cost from $1 million to $10 million a year, depending onthe methods used.   Supporters said the measure was important for its symbolism aswell as for the actual collection of data.   ``Congress should send a clear signal to all people that crimesbased on race, religion or sexuality will not be tolerated,'' saidRep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y.</TEXT></DOC>
