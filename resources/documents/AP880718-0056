As it turned out, it was thelast proud moment for quite a while.   On the morning after the 67-65 victory of Jan. 23, 1986, threemembers of the Golden Gophers basketball team were accused of rapein an incident in a Madison, Wis., hotel room.   The three later were acquitted in a trial filled with sordidtestimony. But the notoriety was only beginning for Minnesota,which is among the nation's largest universities.   With 44,293 undergraduate and graduate students and 18,000extension students, the Minnesota campus sprawls over both banks ofthe Mississippi River near downtown Minneapolis.   The misdeeds, improprieties and embarrassments over the next 31months were dizzying:   _The men's basketball team was placed on probation by theNational Collegiate Athletic Association for numerous infractions,mostly over its recruiting of student athletes.   _University President Ken Keller resigned in a scandal overhundreds of thousands of dollars spent on his official residence.   _Keller's interim replacement, Richard Sauer, admittedplagiarizing part of a magazine article while applying for a jobelsewhere.   _A former university official was indicted on charges ofswindling money and giving it to athletes; the school's popularathletic director, Paul Giel, was fired.   The troubles may be unprecedented among major universities.   Robert L. Gale, president of the Association of Governing Boardsof Universities and Colleges, recalls discussing Minnesota's skidwith colleagues. ``They would say, `Those poor devils. Everythinghas happened to them at once.'''   The long-term effect isn't clear.   ``It is going to be more difficult for the university tofunction in an autonomous fashion because the Legislature is goingto be looking over their shoulder a lot more than it has in thepast,'' said Gale.   After the 1986 rape charges, many people began looking over theuniversity's shoulder.   A Big Ten report later that year said the men's athleticdepartment had the conference's lowest rate of graduation from 1978through 1983.   While the school was still reeling from that report, NCAAinvestigators arrived to investigate recruiting.   In March, the NCAA announced 40 rules violations, most of themin the basketball program under Coach Jim Dutcher, who resignedafter the rape trial.   In the same month, Keller resigned after a six-week controversyover university financial management. It was sparked by his $1.5million renovation of the official residence at more than twice thebudgeted amount.   Keller also approved a $200,000 remodeling of his offices,including a $15,822 mahogany desk and credenza.   Students picketed the mansion, and a local radio station's dittyreferred to Keller as the ``Renovation Man.'' His ``Commitment toFocus'' plan to upgrade some programs, cut others and reduceenrollment by 8,000, was mockingly referred to as ``Commitment toFurniture.''   A widening probe turned up a $221 million reserve fund. Criticscalled it a slush fund, and it rankled professors whose programshad been targeted for elimination and angered some contributors andalumni, who quit giving.   When Sauer took over the president's duties, he remained in hisown home, accepted a used desk and set out to mend fences.   Then the plagiarism scandal hit him while he was applying forthe presidency of North Dakota State University.   After he apologized to the University of Minnesota regents, theygave him a unmanimous vote of confidence. North Dakota State sincehas asked him to renew his application for the presidency.   Sauer's troubles were followed by the athletic department comingunder further investigation. Luther Darville, former actingdirector of the school's Office of Minority and Special StudentAffairs, was indicted in May on three counts of felony theft byswindle.   Darville has fled to his native Bahamas and authorities havestarted extradition proceedings.   University officials acknowledge that the turnover among toppersonnel has caused problems, but they say the school is runningmore smoothly than might be expected.   ``I think the fact is that the university is being well-governedby the interim people,'' said David Lebedoff, chairman of theUniversity of Minnesota Board of Regents.   George Robb, the university's associate vice president forexternal relations, said the school's reputation among the publicis less important than its image among potential students andfaculty.   ``The graduate student or faculty member who might be thinkingabout coming here in physics is much more concerned about thephysics department than the athletic department,'' he said. ``We'vegot more than 100 new endowed chairs that have resulted from thefund-raising campaign that just finished. That's almost anunheard-of number of endowed chairs.''   David Merkowitz, spokesman for the American Council onEducation, said he couldn't recall any other university having somany problems recently.   Still, Merkowitz said, ``I am absolutely sure a university likeMinnesota with 45,000 students is going to survive these things.''</TEXT></DOC>
