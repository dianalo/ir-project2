It consistsof: a control system for effecting control actions to regulate a selectedprocess variable to a value called for by a setpoint reference signal;and means responsive only to rapid fluctuations in the load signal abovea predetermined frequency for adjusting the value of the setpoint referencesignal by an amount which substantially matches the variation in thevalue of the selected process variable expected as a result of the rapidfluctuations in the load signal without control action, and taking intoaccount any time delay in the affect of the rapid fluctuations on theselected process variable, whereby control actions effected by the controlsystem are substantially reduced.</TEXT></DOC>
