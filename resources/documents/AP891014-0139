Students gathered to buy books at the center of the BeijingUniversity campus near a long red banner that urged them to upholdMarxist principles and take a clear stand against Westerncapitalist values.   Few were willing to talk about the protests that ended ingunfire and triggered a hard-line backlash in which Communist PartyGeneral Secretary Zhao Ziyang was ousted and thousands werearrested.   ``Most students have become more realistic about the situationand now they want to study,'' said one. But they reported thatamong themselves, and on other Beijing campuses, students havetaken to sarcastically singing the jingle from a pesticidecommercial that goes, ``We are the harmful insects.''   Students were noticeably fewer than usual. The 750-memberfreshman class _ down from about 2,100 last year _ will be absentall year to undergo military and political training at an armyacademy outside the capital. Their dormitories were empty.   Authorities announced after the protests that freshmen for thefirst time would spend a year at a military academy, but theyinsisted it was not punishment for the pro-democracy protests.   The reduction in the freshman class was part of a nationwide cutin first-year students from about 640,000 to 610,000.   Beijing University has been particularly hard-hit, partlybecause it is mainly a liberal arts school and liberal arts arelosing the most new students. The university played a leading rolein the demonstrations, but authorities claim the enrollmentreductions had nothing to do with that.   The school has an enrollment of about 10,000, but students saidsome upperclassmen failed to show up, fearing investigations oftheir roles in the protests.   Other colleges are still continuing such investigations twomonths after reopening, with special teams pressuring teachers andstudents who were heavily involved to write fuller``self-criticisms,'' or confessions.   An official notice posted in several places at BeijingUniversity said the government would be lenient toward those who``turn themselves in, confess or render meritorious service'' _which it explained meant reporting the crimes of others orproviding evidence.   Other schools reopened early, in August, to complete the springsemester's unfinished work and hold special political ideologyclasses. But Beijing University's opening was delayed until afterthe Oct. 1 anniversary of 40 years of Communist Party rule,apparently for fear its students would disrupt the festivities. Theday passed peacefully.   The party newspaper, the People's Daily, said Friday thatBeijing University was a ``major disaster zone'' during theprotests.   It called for strengthening school management, saying thatpeople with bourgeois liberal, or anti-socialist, views tookadvantage of its past free atmosphere.   ``Bourgeois liberals will always try by hook or by crook tomeddle in Beijing University'' because of its tradition as China'smost prestigious school, it warned.   But university President Wu Shuqing, a Marxist economist whoreplaced the relatively liberal Ding Shisun after the protests,said in an interview last week that he was confident the studentswould be ``more healthy'' this year.   ``The university will help the students to understand how toadvance the nation's economic and political reforms according toChina's actual problems and sticking to a socialist orientation,''he said.   Wu said the school's goal was to train students to be both ``redand expert.''   Beijing University traditionally has led other schools inpolitical activism, dating back to its leadership in the 1919 ``MayFourth Movement,'' a student-led protest movement against Germanconcessions.   Although most students in Beijing and other cities havepredicted there will be no big protests this year, there havealready been individual acts of defiance. One student at atechnical college wrote ``Down with (Premier) Li Peng'' on ablackboard. He was tracked down and arrested.</TEXT></DOC>
