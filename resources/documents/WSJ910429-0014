Cash is pouring into fund companies, andtheir pile of dollars under management stands at a recordhigh of almost $1.2 trillion.   So why are the stocks of most publicly traded mutual fundcompanies trading for less than the market multiple of justunder 18 times earnings?</LP><TEXT>   The last time fund-company shares regularly commanded apremium to the market was in 1985 and 1986, both strong yearsfor mutual fund sales. In 1986, fund companies attracted arecord $165 billion more in new money than they surrenderedto departing shareholders. This year could turn out to be asgood as 1986; fund companies have pulled in $55 billion inthe first two months alone. Yet most fund-company stocks,despite a pretty good run-up so far this year, seem to betrading at bargain levels.   To understand why mutual fund-company stocks aren'tgarnering a lot of enthusiasm, take a look at FranklinResources, the country's largest manager of municipal bondfunds.   Lately, Franklin's business has been chugging alongnicely, but its stock is trading at just 35 7/8, equal to 15times trailing 12-month earnings and less than 13 timesexpected earnings for the fiscal year through September 1992.At first blush, these multiples seem low, especially so sincethe company is sitting on a cash hoard equal to almost $7 ashare.   Why this disparity between the company's business and thecompany's stock? It seems Franklin, like other fundcompanies, has become a victim of its own success. As a fundcompany's assets grow larger, it becomes ever more difficultfor the company to sustain its earlier growth rate.   In the past decade, Franklin was one of the country'sfastest growing fund companies. In the 1980s, the firm'sassets under management surged to $42.4 billion from $277million and its payroll grew to 1,852 from 26. The company'sstock, which started the 1980s at three cents (adjusted forstock splits), closed Friday at 35 7/8.   Franklin is now the largest employer in the city of SanMateo, Calif., where the company is based. &quot;There's kind of alocal joke, you either work for Macy's or you work forFranklin,&quot; says a former employee.   The company's rapid growth has translated intoconsiderable wealth for Franklin President Charles Johnsonand his halfbrother Rupert, who together control 39% of thecompany's stock. Charles Johnson's stake alone is valued atclose to $300 million. In all, six Johnson family memberswork at Franklin, including three of Charles Johnson's sixchildren.   Much of Franklin's growth has been built around thesuccess of just two funds. Its $11.6 billion Franklin U.S.Government Securities Fund was the first fund to investexclusively in Government National Mortgage Associationbonds. Its $11.5 billion Franklin California Tax-Free IncomeFund was the first California -- only municipal bond fund,which means the income it kicks off to California residentsis exempt from both federal and state income taxes.   Both funds were launched in the early 1980s, and togetherthey account for close to half of Franklin's $49 billion inmutual fund assets. Other municipal and taxable bond fundsaccount for another $17 billion in assets. Stock and moneymarket funds account for most of the remaining $8 billion.   Lately, cash has continued to pour into Franklin's funds.Franklin's bond funds have recently garnered interest asinvestors, disgruntled about low money market yields, havestarted moving into bond funds.   Assets are surging at Franklin's adjustable-rate mortgagefund, which so far has attracted $1.5 billion from fundinvestors willing to take a little more risk in order to pickup a higher yield. And as the country's largest manager ofmunicipal bond funds, Franklin has been a big winner duringthe current municipal bond-buying frenzy.   But while Franklin is pulling in heaps of money, itprobably won't translate into rapid earnings growth.Franklin's assets grew an astonishing 65% a year during the1980s. Last year, asset growth was just over 8%. So far thisyear, assets are up almost 6%. Though Franklin is stillattracting investors, compared to the assets it already hasunder management, this new money is a relatively paltry sum.   &quot;The past rate of growth just can't be duplicated,&quot; saysJames Hanbury, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder. &quot;We'reclearly down to a slower rate of growth.&quot;   Mr. Hanbury figures that Franklin's earnings and assetgrowth will chug along at a 10% to 12% annual rate, betterthan the 7% annual earnings growth notched up by the averagecompany in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index.   &quot;I think {Franklin will} grow faster than the market, andit's trading at less than the Sandamp;P 500,&quot; points out Mr.Hanbury. Although Franklin isn't on Wertheim Schroder's listof recommended stocks, Mr. Hanbury does consider the company&quot;moderately undervalued.&quot;   ---   Franklin Resources   (NYSE; Symbol: BEN)                                                                                                          Business: Mutual fund adviser                                                                                                          Year ended Sept. 30, 1990:   Revenue: $287.9 million   Net income: $89.4 million; $2.28 a share                                                                                                          Second quarter, March 31, 1991:   Per-share earnings: 60 cents vs. 56 cents                                                                                                          Average daily trading volume: 48,886 shares                                                                                                          Common shares outstanding: 39 million</TEXT></DOC>
