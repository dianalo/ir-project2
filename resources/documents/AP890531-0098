(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michigan's Supreme Court today refused aspeeded-up ruling on the constitutionality of a voter-approved banon state-funded abortions for the poor.   The high court declined to bypass the Michigan Court of Appealsand take up the issue first, saying it was unconvinced the questionneeded to be handled so quickly.   The Michigan chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union hadappealed directly to the Supreme Court a decision by Wayne CountyCircuit Judge John H. Hausner upholding the ban, which was approvedby the voters in November.   The ACLU acted on behalf of a 15-year-old girl from Detroit whobecame pregnant as a result of a gang rape. The girl's family hadchallenged the cutoff of about $6 million a year for some 18,000Medicaid abortions.   The girl obtained an abortion privately after Hausner upheld theban on use of state money.</TEXT></DOC>
