In its report of an interview with Alexander I. Kondrusev, deputyhealth minister, the Communist Party daily did not say whether theaccords already were in force or when they would take effect.   A spokesman for the Foreign Office in London, speakinganonymously in keeping with British practice, said he was unaware ofany agreements, but ``the Soviet Union introduced certainregulations for foreigners over a year ago. That's all we know.''   No requirement of AIDS tests for visa applications has beenreported.   The Soviets, who once called the deadly disease a purely foreignproblem caused by Western sexual decadence, have expressed growingconcern about it.   Tass reported the country's second AIDS death Tuesday, a4-month-old child from the Odessa region on the Black Sea apparentlyinfected by its mother. A 29-year-old Leningrad prostitute died ofAIDS in September.   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, for which no cure has beenfound, is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles orsyringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,and from pregnant women to their offspring.   Pravda quoted Kondrusev as saying one way to combat the spread ofAIDS was ``the exchange of certificates, which by agreement withanother country, require anyone coming to our country or leaving itto show a document that proves negative results from a test'' forthe virus.   ``Today, such an agreement already exists with the countries ofCOMECON, Great Britain, Denmark and others,'' he said. COMECON isthe Soviet bloc equivalent of the European Economic Community.   Kondrusev said existing regulations require all foreignersstaying more than three months to undergo ``mandatory checkups'' forAIDS.   That requirement, which the Soviets said early last year wasunder study, never has been mandatory for the thousands of Westerndiplomats, business people and journalists who live in Moscow. Itwas not clear whether Kondrusev's remarks presaged wider enforcement.   Some African students who have tested AIDS-positive have beendeported, according to Soviet media reports.   Kondrusev said the Soviet Union had more than 80 carriers of theAIDS virus. He said that was low compared with 70,000 AIDS patientsin the United States, but the number of Soviet carriers had nearlytripled this year.</TEXT></DOC>
