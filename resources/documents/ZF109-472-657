 Three such programs, Freedom of Press 3.0 fromCustom Applications Inc., T-Script 1.3 from TeleTypesetting Co. andUltraScript from QMS Inc., are available now and could be especially usefulfor offices that already have a non-PostScript laser printer or for users ofdot-matrix, inkjet and color printers, most of which are non-PostScript.andM;First the bad news.andP;  While these utilities may sound like attractive low-costalternatives to buying a PostScript printer, there are some serious drawbacksto consider.andP;  Software emulators use the Macintosh's processor to interpretPostScript code and convert it to a bit map, which is then sent to thenon-PostScript printer of your choice.andP;  This typically ties up the Macintoshfor lengthy periods, considerably longer than it takes to print the samedocument to a PostScript printer.andM;Software emulators also require plenty of RAM and disk space.andP;  A minimum of1.5 Mbytes of RAM is needed for the emulator application, so your Mac needs 4Mbytes of RAM and you have to run MultiFinder to print from within a wordprocessor, spreadsheet or other typical application.andP;  Because the first stepin printing is generating a PostScript file, you also need room on your harddisk, because PostScript files can be large.andP;  Our 700-Kbyte PageMaker testfile created a 4-Mbyte PostScript file, while our three-page, 5-Kbyte Worddocument containing 20 downloadable fonts demanded a whopping 2.8 Mbytes inPostScript form.andM;You need a reasonably fast way to transmit the final bit-mapped image of thepage to the printer, and the higher the printer's resolution, the moreinformation needs to be transmitted.andP;  A serial connection is very slow, evenat 19,200 bps.andP;  Users who plan to drive low-cost laser printers, such asHewlett-Packard Co.'s LaserJet series, would be well-advised to consider aparallel interface card.andP;  Laser printers also need at least 1.5 Mbytes of RAMto image a full page, so if you plan to use a standard HP LaserJet IIP, forexample, you'll also need a memory upgrade.andM;QuickDraw printers, such as Apple's LaserWriter IISC and GCC TechnologiesInc.'s PLP II, use the SCSI port to receive information from the Mac, andthis generally is the fastest way to send bit maps to a printer.andM;Only UltraScript is capable of printing directly to a QuickDraw printer fromwithin an application; Freedom of Press and T-Script make you switch manuallyfrom the application you are using to create your documents to another forprinting.andP;  (Neither suffers from this limitation with non-QuickDraw printersthat have their own Macintosh driver.)andM;When you add up the cost of extra disk space, possibly an interface adapter,and RAM for the Mac and the printer, and you factor in the extra print timeand general inconvenience of these emulators, a low-cost PostScript printerstarts to look more attractive, especially considering the increasingcompetition at the low end of the PostScript printer market.andM;However, there are some situations in which a PostScript emulator can proveinvaluable, such as in obtaining PostScript output from non-PostScript colorprinters or film recorders.andP;  The three emulators we tested here all support avariety of popular color printers and film recorders.andP;  In addition, all threepackages let you dedicate a Macintosh as a PostScript print server for anetwork, with the added attraction that only one copy of the emulatorsoftware is needed for the entire network.andP;  The server appears as aChooser-level device to all other machines on the network.andM;Testing.andP;  We tested the three packages in both stand-alone and serverconfigurations, driving an Apple Personal LaserWriter SC and an HP LaserJetIIP from both a Macintosh II equipped with 8 Mbytes of RAM and a 2.5-MbyteMac SE.andP;  We printed five files designed to test both performance andcompatibility.andM;The first, a 17-page Word document with all text in 12-point Courier, was asimple test of overall throughput.andP;  The second, a 20-page Word documentcontaining all four fonts in the Palatino family, gave a more realisticpicture of performance with a typical document.andP;  A three-page Word documentcontaining 20 downloadable fonts provided a rigorous test of font handlingand compatibility.andP;  A single PageMaker page containing rotated text, a TIFFimage and two Encapsulated PostScript graphics tested the capability of thepackages to work with complex PostScript documents.andP;  The final document, a230-Kbyte Adobe Illustrator file containing blends, clipping paths, androtated and skewed text, tested some of the most processor-intensivePostScript features.andM;All three packages have two different versions, one for the Mac Plus and SE,the other for the Mac II family and SE/30.andP;  Because there are majordifferences in performance between the two platforms, we considered themseparately.andM;Freedom of Press.andP;  Installing Freedom of Press is relatively straightforward.andO;The Freedom of Press Installer application leads you through the process,prompting you to insert disks as necessary.andP;  However, configuring it to workwith a QuickDraw printer is less-than-intuitive, and the documentation isn'tas helpful as it should be.andP;  We finally noticed a note in the on-line helptelling us that to work with QuickDraw LaserWriters we had to choose NetworkMode 1 from the Advanced Options menu in the Configuration dialog box.andP;  Thiswasn't mentioned anywhere in the manual, and it didn't seem particularlyintuitive.andP;  However, setting up Freedom of Press to work with an HP LaserJetIIP was easy.andM;The Freedom of Press package contains two applications, Freedom of Press andFP Spooler, as well as a Startup document (INIT) and a folder with supportingfiles.andP;  The FP Spooler application is designed to run under MultiFinder; itappears as a LaserWriter in the Chooser for all users on the network.andP;  If youselect FP Spooler as the current printer, it intercepts an application'sprint output and creates a PostScript file on-disk.andM;If you have sufficient RAM, you can run Freedom of Press 3.0 at the same timeas the application from which you are printing.andP;  If you check the Auto Printoption, it automatically takes the PostScript files created by FP Spooler,interprets them and sends them to the printer for which it's configured.andM;With non-QuickDraw printers, this process is entirely automatic, but withprinters that use Apple's QuickDraw driver, such as Apple's LaserWriter IISCor Personal LaserWriter SC, you must manually initiate printing from Freedomof Press.andP;  An alert appears on-screen asking you to bring Freedom of Press tothe front when it's ready to start printing, so the process isn't difficult,but it means that you can't leave your Macintosh to print unattended.andM;If you're unwilling or unable to use MultiFinder, you must manually create aPostScript file.andP;  Some applications, such as Aldus PageMaker, let you do thisdirectly.andP;  With other applications, pressing Command-K immediately afterclicking OK in the Print dialog box spools a PostScript file to disk.andP;  Youcan then run Freedom of Press 3.0 and print the PostScript file manually.andM;Freedom of Press comes with outline fonts that correspond to the basic 35fonts found in most PostScript printers.andP;  Unlike its predecessors, Freedom ofPress 3.0 directly supports Type 1 PostScript fonts.andP;  It interprets fonthinting slightly differently than true PostScript printers.andP;  While some mayfind this offensive, we think most users will find that the type produced byFreedom of Press is actually superior to that produced by most PostScriptprinters, with sharper serifs and finer line weights.andP;  Freedom of Press workswell with font-management utilities such as Suitcase II and Master Juggler,so we rate its font compatibility as excellent.andP;  Freedom of Press' graphicsoutput was indistinguishable from that of a true PostScript printer.andM;On a Mac II, Freedom of Press was the fastest overall performer, althoughUltraScript proved faster on graphics-intensive files (see chart, previouspage).andP;  However, the version for the Mac Plus and SE was much slower, to thepoint that its usefulness is probably limited to users who havelow-resolution dot-matrix or inkjet printers or the patience of Job.andM;T-Script.andP;  T-Script was the easiest package to install and set up, partlybecause of the concise but clear documentation.andP;  The T-Script packagecontains the T-Script application; 17 outline fonts corresponding to theCourier, Helvetica, Helvetica Narrow, Times and Symbol families; and aspecial version of Apple's LaserWriter 6.0.1 and Laser Prep 6.0.1 driver thatputs a Print to Disk option in the Print dialog box.andM;Working with T-Script and a QuickDraw printer is somewhat cumbersome.andP;  Whenyou print a document from within an application, you first choose LaserWriterfrom the Chooser and click the Print to Disk option.andP;  Then you switch toT-Script, choose the QuickDraw printer driver in the Chooser, select thePostScript file you created and print.andM;With non-QuickDraw printers, T-Script appears in the Chooser as aLaserWriter, and you can simply print to it, assuming that T-Script is openand running under MultiFinder.andP;  Users who have insufficient RAM to run theirapplication and T-Script under MultiFinder can use the Print to Disk optionto create PostScript files, then quit their application, launch T-Script andprint.andM;T-Script's unique preview function lets you print a PostScript document to awindow on-screen in black and white or color, and it also has a text windowin which you can enter up to 30 Kbytes of PostScript code directly.andP;  Takentogether, these make T-Script a PostScript debugging and learning tool andprovide the best reason for buying the program.andM;T-Script 1.3 directly supports Type 1 fonts and works with Suitcase II andMaster Juggler.andP;  It doesn't read hints as well as PostScript, so the type issomewhat heavier than type from a true PostScript printer.andP;  It also had aproblem with the TIFF image in our PageMaker file, printing a mostly blackbox with a few white pixels.andM;T-Script was the slowest of the three packages on both platforms.andP;  The MacPlus and SE version failed to print two of the three test files we used andprinted the PageMaker file only after almost two hours.andP;  If you want to learnmore about PostScript and to write PostScript code directly, T-Script is avaluable tool.andP;  But as a PostScript printing utility, its usefulness islimited at best.andM;UltraScript.andP;  UltraScript is easy to install and fairly straightforward toconfigure but suffers from a couple of glaring weaknesses.andP;  UltraScript&quot;supports&quot; Type 1 fonts only via a utility that converts Type 1 toUltraScript's own QMS font format.andP;  Each typeface takes 40 seconds toconvert, and unless you're prepared to delete your Type 1 fonts, you need tofind disk space for the QMS fonts as well.andM;We ran into a serious problem when trying to convert Stone Serif Bold to QMSformat.andP;  Not only did the conversion not work, but the resulting font killedthe UltraScript application and damaged the directory on our hard disk.andP;  QMS'tech-support line professed ignorance about the font conversion utility anddirected us to the California office.andP;  We did get a call within 24 hoursconfirming the problem, but the only work-around QMS was able to offer was toavoid using that font.andM;We also found that we had to install the screen fonts directly into theSystem file, rather than use a font-handling utility.andP;  QMS tech support toldus that they &quot;had never tried&quot; using Suitcase II or Master Juggler, which webelieve is simply out of step with the realities of Mac font management.andM;Apart from these fairly serious limitations, UltraScript was a smooth andsolid performer.andP;  It provides a Chooser-level driver that automaticallyspools PostScript to disk and, if you're running MultiFinder, to theUltraScript application.andP;  (If you run under the Finder, you can spool filesto disk and print them later from the UltraScript application.)andM;Graphics output from UltraScript was indistinguishable from true PostScript,but the QMS fonts showed noticeable stair-stepping on diagonal lines whencompared with true PostScript fonts.andM;UltraScript was significantly slower than Freedom of Press in font-intensivefiles and somewhat faster on graphics when running on a Macintosh II.andP;  It wasthe only one of the three packages to offer acceptable speed when printinggraphics from a Macintosh SE, however.andM;Network operation.andP;  All three packages work smoothly when used in theirserver configuration; they simply appear as LaserWriters in the Chooser.andP;  Allthree have an option to delete the spooled PostScript file after printing,which is necessary to avoid filling the server hard disk too quickly.andO;Printing to a high-resolution color device such as a film recorder almostdemands a fast Mac as a server; the higher the output resolution, the longerit takes to create and send the bit-mapped image to the output device.andO;Printing color also requires more RAM.andP;  The minimum realistic requirement is4 Mbytes of RAM in a server used for color printing.andM;Conclusions.andP;  Freedom of Press 3.0 is the most polished of the threepackages, but its documentation could stand improvement: Small mistakes inconfiguration can quickly land you in the Twilight Zone, as we found when weinadvertently created a 28-Mbyte PostScript file when trying to print athree-page document.andP;  Macintosh Plus and SE users with low-resolutionprinters might find its performance acceptable, but we felt it was simply tooslow driving a 300-dpi printer from those machines.andM;T-Script scores points for clear documentation, and its preview feature is awonderful tool for those who want to hack PostScript code, but as a printerdriver it's very slow.andM;UltraScript is reasonably speedy on both 68000-based Macs and on the Mac IIfamily, but in a market in which virtually every vendor is moving towarddirect Type 1 font support, QMS clearly is marching to a different drummer.andO;We find its lack of support for Suitcase II and Master Juggler very hard toforgive.andM;As specialized tools for providing non-PostScript color printers and filmrecorders with PostScript compatibility, each of these packages provides asolution, but for the average user, they promise more than they deliver.andM;PostScript emulatorsandM;These three PostScript emulators let you get PostScript output fromnon-PostScript printers.andP;  But they are especially useful when used with colorprinters and film recorders for which PostScript options often areunavailable.andP;  All three packages require a Mac II or better, 4 Mbytes of RAMand MultiFinder for optimal operation.andP;  With a Plus or SE, they are glaciallyslow or simply fail to print.andP;  However, they all work smoothly as printservers on a network, so if a fast Mac is used as a server, slower Macs couldbe used as workstations.andM;Freedom of Press is the clear winner in terms of overall speed, compatibilityand convenience.andP;  However, it cannot print directly to a SCSI QuickDrawprinter; you must manually bring Freedom of Press to the foreground toinitiate printing when prompted to do so.andM;UltraScript provides its own Chooser-level driver, but its indirect supportof Type 1 fonts leaves a lot to be desired, and its lack of support forfont-management utilities such as Suitcase and Master Juggler is hard toforgive.andP;  However, if you can live within these constraints, UltraScriptperforms smoothly.andP;  For graphics files, it's a little faster than Freedom ofPress, but it slows down in documents that contain mostly text.andM;T-Script was slower than the other two packages and printing to SCSIQuickDraw printers was cumbersome.andP;  Printing to serial or parallel printers,however, is transparent.andP;  T-Script's unique preview window and direct inputfrom a text window makes it a valuable tool for learning or debuggingPostScript, but its overall slowness and minor compatibility problems make ita questionable choice.andM;If you don't need to print PostScript graphics or complex desktop publishingfiles, Adobe Type Manager 2.0 provides Type 1 font compatibility with muchfaster print times, fewer hardware demands and a lower price than thePostScript emulators.andP;  Printing our downloadable font document to thePersonal LaserWriter SC using Apple's driver with ATM 2.0 took only twominutes and 31 seconds, compared with more than 10 minutes for the fastest ofthe emulator packages, with no discernible difference in the quality of theoutput.andP;
