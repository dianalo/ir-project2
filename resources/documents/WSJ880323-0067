Sesit (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP CANDA FREST JAPAN </CO><IN> MON PCS CMD FRX </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Canadian dollar continued to climb to a four-year high yesterday in light trading that saw the U.S. dollar inch up against the West German mark, break even against the yen, and fall slightly against its British counterpart.    In late activity, the Canadian dollar was quoted at 80.25 U.S. cents, up from 80.08 cents Monday. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar rose to 1.6919 West German marks compared with 1.6894 marks late Monday, and stood unchanged at 127.05 yen. At $1.8315, the British pound was slightly higher than its late Monday quote of $1.8302.    The dollar opened Wednesday in Tokyo at 126.91 yen, down from 127.07 yen at the close of trading Tuesday.    Attracted to high yielding Canadian securities and a relatively strong economy, investors and currency traders &quot;are stretching for yield on top of a reinforcement that the yield will stay there,&quot; said William Orsini, corporate foreign exchange manager for Bank of Montreal in New York.    Three-month and six-month Canadian Treasury bills currently are yielding 8.51% and 8.84%, respectively. That compares with current rates of 5.81% and 5.97% for comparable U.S. securities.    Moreover, &quot;you've had very strong economic growth in Canada through 1987, and we've seen it so far this year,&quot; said Mr. Orsini. &quot;If you add the two together, it means they aren't going to be forced to lower interest rates.&quot; Mr. Orsini noted that Bank of Canada Governor John Crow has stated that &quot;his number one objective is to fight inflation,&quot; seeking to keep it below 4% annually. In February, Canadian inflation, on a yearly basis, stood just about at 4%, said Mr. Orsini.    Elsewhere, &quot;the big play continues to be the yen-mark; that seems to be the cross everyone's fallen in love with,&quot; said Robert Hatcher, a vice president at Barclays Bank PLC in New York. Trading the yen-mark so-called cross rate was especially strong on Monday and in Far Eastern markets Tuesday until the Bank of Japan reportedly intervened late in Tokyo activity to support the U.S. currency. At the time the dollar was trading near its intraday low of 126.80 yen. The intervention amounts were reported to be small, about $10 million.    When traders buy yen against marks, they use the U.S. currency as an intermediary vehicle, selling marks for dollars and then selling the dollars for yen. That tends to boost the dollar against the mark but weaken it against its Japanese counterpart. Yesterday, the Japanese central bank temporarily damped that play by selling yen for dollars.    &quot;People think the dollar has been artificially propped up, not only by the Bank of Japan but also the life insurance companies,&quot; said Mr. Hatcher. That's because under Japanese accounting regulations if the average yen-dollar rate for March is more than 15% below where it stood on March 31, 1987, Japan's life insurance companies could be forced to write down the value of their nonlisted dollar-denominated securities. The so-called magic rate is believed to be roughly 126.85 yen.    Nonetheless, many dealers and speculators have been seeking to buy yen and sell marks, because they believe that when the the new Japanese fiscal year begins on April 1, the yen will appreciate more quickly against the dollar than will the West German currency.    Shigeru Tokunaga, foreign-exchange manager for Fuji Bank Ltd. in New York, noted that Japan's economy is growing faster than most of those of Continental Europe and that Japanese interest rates could widen their yield differential over West German rates. Currently three-month Euroyen deposit rates yield 4.31%, a full percentage point more than their mark equivalents.    Consequently, &quot;it is easy to buy yen against some European currencies, especially against deutschemarks and Swiss francs,&quot; said Mr. Tokunaga. He added: &quot;There's speculation that after April 1 (Japanese) institutional investors will come back into the market and sell dollars to hedge their portfolios.&quot;    In another actively traded cross-rate, sterling at one point climbed above 3.10 marks before retreating to 3.0987 in late trading. &quot;The market's always probing, always testing to see whether the Bank of England will come in,&quot; to weaken the pound, said Mr. Hatcher of Barclays. The concern is that a strong pound erodes the competitiveness of British goods against those of its major European trading partners.    Elsewhere, the Bank de France injected 17.65 billion francs ($3.07 billion) into the domestic banking system through repurchase agreements, just over half the amount of earlier agreements set to expire today.    Analysts said the slight credit tightening reflected concern that the franc might come under selling pressure against the mark within the eight-currency European Monetary System in the weeks preceding the two-stage French presidential elections ending in May. The central bank left its key money-market intervention rate unchanged at 7.25%.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $448.70 an ounce, down 50 cents. Trading was moderate at an estimated 2.9 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $449.50 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Tuesday, March 22, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
