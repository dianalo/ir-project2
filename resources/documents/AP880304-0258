The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Thursdayrejected a bid from Kajima Corp., a major Japanese contractor,together with Peter Kiewit and Sons Corp. of the United States, toconstruct a 1,200-meter subway tunnel and station in WashingtonD.C., officials said.   According to the Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), it was thefirst time a Japanese construction firm involved in bidding for anAmerican public works project was rejected since the U.S. Congresslast year passed legislation calling for reciprocity in awardingsuch contracts.   Local reports said the bid by the two companies totaled 6.3billion yen, or $48.8 million, the lowest offer among anunspecified number of international bidders.   Hajime Sako, chairman of the Japan Federation of ConstructionContractors Inc., said in a statement that ``...the fact that theJapanese firm's tender was actually canceled is extremelyregrettable.''   Sako, also chairman of Taisei Corp., a major Japaneseconstruction firm, said the local construction industry ``stronglyhopes the latest U.S. measure will be retracted as soon aspossible, and that such a measure, which will adversely affectfriendly Japan-U.S. relations, will not be taken again.''   Kishio Nagayama, president of Kajima Engineering andConstruction Inc., a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary based in LosAngeles, California, that handled the latest bidding, alsoexpressed regret over the decision.   In a statement issued by the company's head office in Tokyo,Nagayama said his company will decide how to respond by consultingwith its U.S. partner.   Japanese and U.S. officials resumed working-level talks inWashington Thursday to discuss access to Japan's large-scaleconstruction projects. Both sides failed to reach agreement in aprevious meeting held in Tokyo last month.   Access to the Japanese construction market has been a majortrade issue in recent years between the two countries. To date,U.S. firms have had access to only two semi-public projects inJapan _ the Tokyo Bay bridge and the multi-billion dollar KansaiInternational airport project.   Japanese firms won about $2.3 billion worth of contracts in theUnited States in 1986, while U.S. companies did about $500 milliondollars worth of business in Japan, according to constructionofficials.</TEXT></DOC>
