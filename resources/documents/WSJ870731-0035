The institutions closed yesterday were First National Bank of Yukon, Yukon, Okla., which had assets of $37.8 million; Bank of Granite, Granite, Okla., which had assets of $13.9 million, and Empire National Bank, Los Angeles, which had assets of $9.2 million.    First National was closed by the Comptroller of the Currency. Its single office is to reopen tomorrow as a branch of Bank of Oklahoma, Tulsa. The failed bank held deposits of $38.5 million in 7,800 accounts, including $24,000 in nine accounts that exceeded the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor.    Bank of Granite's office, closed by state banking authorities, is to reopen today as a branch of Farmers andamp; Merchants Bank, Maysville, Okla. The failed bank held $12.7 million in 1,800 deposit accounts, including $109,000 in nine accounts that exceeded the insurance limit.    Owners of uninsured deposits at both banks will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds from the sale of the failed banks' assets. A total of 17 Oklahoma banks have failed this year.    The FDIC said it was trying last night to arrange for the sale of Empire National, which was closed by the comptroller's office. Empire National, which held $7.6 million in 700 deposit accounts, was the fifth bank to fail this year in California. </TEXT></DOC>
