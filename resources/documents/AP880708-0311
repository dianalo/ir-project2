Levine can'tpay his $12.2 million tax bill with the money he made throughillegal activities, a federal judge has ruled.   Instead, said U.S. District Judge Richard Owen in a ruling lateThursday, the money should go to compensate defrauded investors.   Owen rejected motions by Levine and convicted co-conspiratorRobert Wilkis to pay off their tax liabilities with disgorgedprofits now in the hands of the government.   Owen also rejected the Securities and Exchange Commission'sproposed plan for distributing the $12.8 million disgorged byLevine and the $3.4 million Wilkis has relinquished.   The pair wanted their federa; tax bills _ $12.2 million forLevine and more than $2.8 million for Wilkis _ to take precedenceover investor claims.   The SEC at first balked, but later devised a compromise plan inwhich 42 percent of the Levine money and 49 percent of the Wilkismoney would go toward federal and state tax claims.   Owen refused to approve it.   ``It is almost an affront to suggest that those defrauded byLevine's insider trading activities have their recovery reduced bythe amount of his fine,'' said the judge, calling the fine``personal and punitive in nature and as such is not subject topayment out of Levine's illegal gains to the detriment ofinvestors.'   Lawyers for both Levine and Wilkis said they would appeal theruling.   Levine, a former Wall Street investment banker, confessed in1986 to masterminding a massive insider trading scheme, using hisadvance knowledge of impending takeover deals to profit by buyingand selling stocks.   Levine's admissions implicated other Wall Street professionals,including speculator Ivan Boesky, who paid the SEC a record $100million in penalties and disgorged profits to settle an insidertrading claim.   Levine pleaded guilty to four criminal counts and was sentencedto two years in prison. Earlier this week he was released to ahalfway house for the remainder of his term.   Wilkis, another former investment banker, pleaded guilty toinsider trading charges in 1986 and was sentenced to a year inprison.</TEXT></DOC>
