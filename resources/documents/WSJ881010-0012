British officials said talks between the two sides are continuing after a meeting in Brussels last week. They said the British government is defending the 15% ceiling it set on foreign stakes in Rolls-Royce when the company was privatized last year.    The British contend Rolls-Royce is exempt from EC internal-market rules that ban discrimination by one member state against shareholders in other EC countries because the engine maker produces military equipment. EC regulations permit exceptions based on national-security grounds.    &quot;We are trying to satisfy the commission's concerns,&quot; one British official said. A commission spokesman declined to comment on the issue. But Lord Cockfield, the internal-market commissioner, in March wrote to Lord Young, British trade and industry secretary, warning that the 15% limit might violate EC law. The commission apparently has received complaints from other EC countries, but it hasn't yet begun formal infringement procedures.    The negotiations between London and Brussels are taking place in the midst of a controversy over Britain's decision to order Kuwait to cut its stake in British Petroleum Co. by more than half, to 9.9%. The move angered Kuwait, which has hinted it might retaliate, and has raised fears in Britain that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is retreating from her free-market principles. </TEXT></DOC>
