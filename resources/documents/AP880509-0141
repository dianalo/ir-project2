NOW also urged the Democrats to continue official support of theEqual Rights Amendment, abortion rights and gay rights, and to adda new platform plank promoting women candidates.   ``We think it would be a very serious mistake'' to eliminate allpotentially controversial issues from the platform, NOW PresidentMolly Yard said at a news conference a day before she was scheduledto testify before the party's platform committee.   Yard distributed a list of 47 prominent Democratic women, sayingshe wants the party to consider them as national conventionspeakers and officers as well as potential running mates.   On the list are current and former office-holders from Congressdown to city council, including former New York Rep. GeraldineFerraro, who was chosen by Walter F. Mondale as his running mate in1984. Women's groups, including NOW, heavily lobbied Mondale to puta woman on the ticket.   Others on the list include Rep. Patricia Schroeder of Colorado,Vermont Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin, Rep. Barbara Kennelly ofConnecticut, Houston Mayor Kathy Whitmire, former San FranciscoMayor Dianne Feinstein and Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland.   Asked which vice presidential nominees would be acceptable orunacceptable to NOW this year, former NOW chief Eleanor Smeal namedSen. Sam Nunn as a negative example.   Citing the Georgia senator's support for banning abortion andfor an ERA only with amendments, she said, ``His position onwomen's issues would not be called exemplary.''   ``We want both parties to consider a woman vice presidentialcandidate,'' Smeal said. ``There are plenty of prospectivecandidates out there who are women and we think they should beconsidered seriously.''   Smeal and Yard said they are confident ERA, abortion and gayrights, as well as others supporting child care, family leave, payequity and a minimum wage hike, will remain in the platform.   ``They don't have the votes to delete these planks. They're justnot there,'' Smeal said. She said there would be a strong feministcontingent at the Atlanta convention in July.   Smeal said she would introduce a new platform plank requiringequal representation of women candidates in primaries. She notedthe Democrats already have a rule requiring equal numbers of menand women on committees and at conventions.   Under her proposal, endorsements by Democratic organizationswould have to be split 50-50 between male and female candidates.She said she intends to press it at the Republican convention aswell.   Smeal said the current system amounts to ``incumbent protectionclubs'' that give people ``30 years of job security whether they'redoing the job or not. ... This is just suicide to have a policythat is keeping their decisionmakers virtually all white men.''   Democratic leaders, including party chairman Paul Kirk, havesaid they may try to win a brief platform acceptable to allDemocrats that excludes specific mention of controversial topics.</TEXT></DOC>
