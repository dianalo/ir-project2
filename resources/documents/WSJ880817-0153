The ministry said it will establish an independent division, within the Securities Supervisory Board, responsible for uncovering insider trading and making recommendations for legal action.    The steps, aimed at protecting investors and strengthening development of the financial markets, will take effect Sept. 1, after the related regulations are revised, a ministry spokesman said.    The stock market watchdog body will make a &quot;black list&quot; of those with access to inside knowledge based on computerized data. The data will include securities trading of insiders who are director-class officials of business concerns, shareholders with more than a 10% equity stake, and other individuals and corporations having access to inside information, it said.    The ministry also said the government will order officials at the securities-related organizations to report signs of unfair trading to the SSB.    The Korea Stock Exchange will automatically start surveillance of the market when stock prices and trading volume fluctuate suddenly and notify the SSB of its opinion, it said.    The SSB will be authorized to trace the origin of unfair trading funds, in cooperation with the Office of Bank Supervision and Examination, and to notify the Office of National Tax Administration of the results of the investigation, according to the ministry.    If found to have engaged in irregular trading practices, violators will face legal punishment, and firms committing irregularities will be obliged to publish an apology in daily newspapers, it said.    The ministry will rewrite the related laws and decrees to guarantee the rights of investors who have had financial losses through unfair trading practices such as price manipulation. </TEXT></DOC>
