The colliery of thefuture will be a semi-automated one whose individual systems will benetworked together and organised in a hierarchical-decentralised structure.The lowest hierarchical level is mainly focussed on the automation ofsubsystems, particularly in the winning area. The missing links in thischain mainly comprise sensors capable of detecting the boundary layerbetween coal and the surrounding rock. The computer-backed area controlstation controls and monitors underground operations from a surface vantagepoint. This has resulted in a significant improvement in the machineutilization rate. Information centres are currently being introducedthroughout the industry to serve as the management centre for that particularcolliery. The data compiled are also processed by the colliery's businesscomputer unit; this would include information from the subsystems personnel,materials, operations management, planning and cost controlling. Extensivedata stocks are stored and processed in the company's central computer.All computer units, including personal computers networked together atmanagement level, have access to the mass data stores of the other computers.6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
