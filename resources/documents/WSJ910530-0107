In January, the FDIC projected that a total of 340 bankswould fail in 1991 and 1992 if the recession ended in themiddle of this year, and that 440 banks would fail over thetwo years if the recession continued into 1992.</LP><TEXT>   For several months, FDIC officials have adhered to the&quot;baseline&quot; forecast of 340 failures. &quot;However, our presentexpectations place us somewhere between the two scenarios,&quot;John Bovenzi, deputy to FDIC Chairman William Seidman, toldthe House Ways and Means Committee yesterday. &quot;The longer therecession continues, particularly if it extends into 1992,the further we are likely to move toward, and perhaps beyond,the pessimistic scenario&quot; of 440 failures over two years, hesaid.   An increase in bank failures would further strain the BankInsurance Fund, which backs deposits up to $100,000. Underthe baseline forecast, the FDIC projects that the fund, whichtotaled $8.4 billion at the end of 1990, will fall to $4.1billion at the end of this year, and $3.6 billion by the endof 1992. The pessimistic forecast puts the fund at $200million at the end of this year and $4.6 billion in deficitat the end of next year.   So far this year, bank failures are running behind theprojected rate. In its baseline forecast, the FDIC projected180 failures this year; 53 have failed so far. But theeconomy's reluctant recovery is prompting the agency toproject an increase in failures next year, Mr. Bovenzi saidafter the hearing. &quot;We're closer to midyear, and we haven'thad a turnaround yet,&quot; he said. In its pessimistic forecast,the FDIC projects 230 failures this year and 210 in 1992.Last year, 169 banks failed.   &quot;Even if the economy turned around within a month or so,you are still going to get a good number of bank failuresbecause the banking industry's turnaround always lags thegeneral economic turnaround,&quot; Mr. Bovenzi told the panel.   The worsening bank failure projections are likely toincrease pressure on Congress to pass a plan to expand FDICauthority to meet fund losses with expanded borrowing to berepaid slowly by the banks.   &quot;Clearly, without recapitalization, the Bank InsuranceFund could well become insolvent,&quot; Mr. Bovenzi warned. TheFDIC recently voted to boost the insurance premiums banks payto 23 cents for each $100 of domestic deposits, from thecurrent 19.5 cents. The increase, which takes effect June 30,was designed to pump more money into the fund and to repay upto $10 billion the FDIC is prepared to borrow to cover fundlosses.   In addition, the Bush administration has proposed a planto allow the FDIC to borrow up to $25 billion (including the$10 billion the agency already is prepared to borrow) fromthe Federal Reserve Board, to be paid back over 15 years bybanks.   A House Banking subcommittee recently passed a plan thatwould allow the FDIC to borrow $30 billion from the Treasuryto cover losses. Robert Glauber, Treasury undersecretary forfinance, told the Ways and Means Committee that the Houseversion &quot;appears workable,&quot; although the administrationprefers its own plan.</TEXT></DOC>
