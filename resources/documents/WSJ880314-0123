The Kuwaiti government's investment arm began to amass BP shares last November. Since then, market observers have been guessing how high Kuwait would take its holding. Analysts recently had suggested the KIO would seek a 25% stake and a seat on BP's board.    The agency surprised market observers late Friday by announcing that it intends to boost its BP stake no further than 22.5%. But yesterday, KIO Deputy Chairman Fauad Jaffar said on British television that the agency considers that decision a short-term commitment. &quot;If the situation changes, obviously any prudent investor must have an open mind, and one cannot make judgments on the future on unknown matters,&quot; Mr. Jaffar said.    On Friday the KIO repeated its assertions, made over the past few months, that it considers its BP stake a long-term investment and won't seek a board seat.    Earlier Friday, the KIO said it had boosted its BP holding to 21.28% from 19.53%. The agency declined to say when it would raise its stake to 22.5%. The two announcements sparked heavy trading in BP shares, accounting for nearly 27% of volume Friday on London's stock exchange.    BP declined comment on either KIO announcement. But it has viewed the agency's share purchases with growing alarm. Last month, Chairman Sir Peter Walters said he would be worried if the KIO boosted its then-19.53% holding above 20%.    Opposition politicians also have voiced anxiety about a foreign agency's building up a major stake in BP. Government officials have met KIO representatives to discuss the BP holding. A government spokesman said Friday that the KIO announcements didn't change the situation, as the agency already has told the government it wouldn't try to control BP.    The KIO's new assurances won't necessarily relieve BP's fears. The planned 22.5% holding still represents &quot;a very substantial stake,&quot; said Simon Irwin, an analyst at the London stockbrokerage Sheppards. &quot;And there's always the threat they could take their stake higher if they wanted to. There's nothing to stop them, except their own word.&quot;    Still, the immediate threat of the KIO's asserting significant control over BP's management appears to have ended. &quot;BP would have been happier with under 20%,&quot; said Michael Unsworth, an analyst at Smith New Court, another London brokerage. But the agency's planned 22.5% stake falls short of the level at which it would be able to block shareholder motions requiring 75% approval, the analyst said.    The KIO's announcements Friday whipped BP's stock up and down on the London exchange. The shares surged after the office announced it would boost its holding to 22.5%, as U.S. and Japanese investors scrambled to buy shares on the Kuwaitis' coattails, London analysts said. Fully paid BP shares climbed nine pence (17 cents) to 286 pence ($5.28), and partly paid shares rose 3 1/2 pence, to 86 1/2 pence.    But the stock tumbled an hour later, after the KIO said it wouldn't boost its BP holding beyond 22.5%. The fully paid shares traded late Friday at 274 pence, down three pence, while the partly paid shares traded at 81 1/2 pence, down 1 1/2 pence.    About 102 million fully paid BP shares and 82 million partly paid shares changed hands on the exchange.    The KIO's 21.8% stake represents about 1.27 billion BP shares, up from the agency's previous holding of about 1.16 billion shares. </TEXT></DOC>
