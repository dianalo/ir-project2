<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-26-0532 </DOCNO><TEXT>The presence of right-handed currents and left-right mixing contributesto the neutrino radiative decay amplitude a term that is directly proportionalto the charged lepton mass. This has led to the suggestion that observabledecays of relic neutrinos might occur in the left-right model or themirror model. Explicit calculations in these models are carried out includinga careful analysis of the origin of neutrino mass, here assumed to bea Dirac mass. It is found that the amplitude is proportional to the neutrinomass and thus too small to be of interest. A brief comment on the neutrinomagnetic moment in an SU(2)/sub L/ x U(1)/sub Y/ model, which containsan iso-singlet charged scalar eta/sup +/, is also presented.</TEXT></DOC>
