A federal appeals court ruling that upheld the award makes ``amirage'' of the required appellate court review of libel lawsuitswon by public figures, the justices were told.   ``The central difficulty of the court of appeals ruling is thatit eviscerates the rule of independent review,'' argued Lee Levine,a Washington lawyer for The Hamilton Journal-News.   The award was won by Daniel Connaughton, a Hamilton lawyer whounsuccessfully ran for the office of municipal judge in a 1983election against incumbent James H. Dolan.   John A. Lloyd of Cincinnati, a lawyer representing Connaughton,urged the justices to uphold his client's legal victory.   ``His evidence was massive, his cause was just,'' Lloyd contendedafter accusing the newspaper of writing falsehoods about Connaughtonwith ``perverse, premeditated ignorance.''   The court's decision, expected by July, could supply importantnew guidelines about how closely appeals courts must scrutinize juryfindings of ``actual malice'' when a public figure sues for libel.   About five weeks before the municipal judge election, Connaughtonfiled a private criminal complaint with Hamilton police based oncorruption allegations against Billy New, then the municipal court'schief administrative officer.   Connaughton told police that two women claimed to have paidbribes to New to ``fix'' cases, and that one of the women said someof the transactions had occurred in Dolan's presence.   New eventually was convicted of bribery. Dolan was not indicted.   Connaughton's campaign contended that Dolan bore the ultimateresponsibility for ``any failure to manage the court or itsemployees.''   A Nov. 1, 1983, article in the Journal-News said one of the womenwho offered grand jury testimony against New ``claims DanConnaughton offered her and her sister jobs and a trip to Florida`in appreciation' for their help.''   The article quoted the woman as saying she thought Connaughtonused ``dirty tricks'' in obtaining her cooperation with hisinvestigation of New.   Connaughton sued Harte-Hanks Communications, the newspaper'spublisher, for libel. A federal jury awarded him $5,000 incompensatory damages and $195,000 in punitive damages.   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the award last year,rejecting the newspaper's arguments that a 1984 Supreme Courtdecision required a reversal of the verdict.   In a case called Bose vs. Consumers Union, the nation's highestcourt in 1984 said appeals courts have broad authority _ and aconstitutionally required obligation _ to second-guess trial courtsin libel cases filed by public figures.   To win a libel suit, a public figure must prove the allegedlylibelous statement was false and was made with ``actual malice'' _knowledge or reckless disregard of its falsity.   In the 1984 ruling, the justices said appeals court judges ``mustindependently decide whether the evidence in the record issufficient to cross a constitutional threshold that bars the entryof any (libel) judgment that is not supported by clear andconvincing proof of actual malice.''   In Connaughton's case, the 6th Circuit court said the 1984 callfor independent review does not apply to a case's facts but instead``was limited to a review of the ultimate conclusion of clear andconvincing proof of actual malice.''   Attacking that ruling Monday, Levine argued for the Hamiltonpaper that the 6th Circuit ``erected a presumption of actual malicein every case.''   But Lloyd contended that if the justices reverse Connaughton'svictory they would be erecting ``a rule of absolute immunity'' forthe news media against libel suits by public figures.   He said a decision favoring the Hamilton Journal-News would``send a signal'' to other defamed public figures ``to give up.''   The case is Harte-Hanks vs. Connaughton, 88-10.</TEXT></DOC>
