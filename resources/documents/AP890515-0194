Ron Brown, Labor Party member of Parliament, made public aletter he said he received from the Libyan government thanking himfor a communication and offering to ``do anything you recommend tosecure the release of individuals held hostage.''   The letter expressed opposition to terrorism and said, ``Weinvite you to visit Beirut to discuss your proposals with our localrepresentative.''   Britain broke diplomatic relations with Libya in April 1984after a policewoman was fatally shot during a demonstration bydissident Libyans outside Libya's embassy in London. Britain saidshe was killed by a Libyan shooting from inside the embassy.   Brown has links with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi and hashelped gain the release of several Britons who were detained inLibya.   Gadhafi has repeatedly denied claims by the United States andsome Western European that his government supports internationalterrorism. Some of the hostages in Lebanon are believed to be heldby pro-Iranian terrorists.   British hostages believed held in Beirut are Terry Waite, thearchbishop of Canterbury's special envoy; journalist John McCarthyand Brian Keenan, a teacher with dual Irish-British nationality. Afourth Briton, Jack Mann, disappeared in Beirut Friday and his wifesaid she feared he had been kidnapped.   Twelve other foreign hostages were kidnapped in Lebanon,including nine Americans.
