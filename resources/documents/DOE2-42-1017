<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-42-1017 </DOCNO><TEXT>Gives an economist's view of the structure of the USSR coal industry withrecommendations for its future development. The coal industry generallyhas too high a ratio of passive to active fixed assets. Equipment costshave risen by several times over 10-20 years, which, coupled with increasedcosts of deeper underground mining, has tended to offset the greaterproductivity achieved. Hydraulic mining is recommended as much more efficientthan conventional underground mining (output by this method scheduledto increase to 10.3 million t/a by 1990). Surface mining is also recommendedover underground (9 times higher labor productivity, 4.5 times lowercoal production cost - scheduled to constitute 46% of total coal productionby 1990). Presents a number of general recommendations for improvingefficiency in underground mining, while observing that the greatest benefitsare expected from the Kansk-Achinsk and Ehkibastuz coalfields (surfacemining) where the level of return on assets exceeds the average for undergroundmining by a factor of 6-6.5. 3 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
