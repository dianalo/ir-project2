But as the American economic picture continues to worsen,a successful war campaign may not keep the dollar fromdeclining, analysts say.</LP><TEXT>   Adapting to trade in a wartime market, currencies nolonger swing wildly on each news report from the Persian Gulfregion. As a result, the U.S. dollar's status as aflight-to-quality security is eroding.   &quot;The foreign exchange market has gotten used to trading onwar news,&quot; says Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst at ShearsonLehman Brothers. &quot;Instead of trading on every singleheadline, it seems to be able to decide what's important,&quot;she adds.   And when there's a lull in news from the front lines, themarkets still look to economics on the home front, analystssay.   Recent reports indicate that the U.S. economy is in arecession of undetermined longevity and severity. WhileFriday's report that fourth-quarter U.S. gross nationalproduct was stronger than expected, &quot;it still is reflectiveof a weak economy,&quot; says Ms. Finstrom.   The Commerce Department said the economy declined 2.1% inthe quarter, less than the 3.1% decline forecast on averageby economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.   Late Friday, the dollar was quoted at 1.4915 marks and132.50 yen, up from 1.4865 marks and 132.35 yen late Thursdayin New York. The previous Friday, the dollar ended at 1.4975marks and 132.25 yen.   In Tokyo early Monday, the dollar was trading at 132.60yen, up from Friday's Tokyo close of 132.38 yen. Meanwhile,the U.S. currency was trading at 1.4890 marks, up a bit from1.4878 marks at Friday's close.   In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee lastweek, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said thatthe Fed was concerned about the sluggish growth in the moneysupply. As a result, a further easing of interest rates sooncould be in the offing, Mr. Greenspan indicated.   Many foreign exchange analysts expect this Friday'semployment report to show that nonfarm payrolls continue todecline, another bearish factor for the dollar.   Barring any radical change in the Mideast war situation,U.S. economic news will greatly affect the dollar, says EarlJohnson, vice president, foreign exchange division at HarrisTrust andamp; Savings Bank in Chicago.   &quot;Weak economic fundamentals indicate a weaker dollar,&quot; Mr.Johnson says. He sees a rising dollar hitting resistance at1.4925 marks and a falling dollar finding support at 1.4825marks.   &quot;Now that we're in a recession, we need to know how bad itis. If we continue to see deterioration of these figures,that will change the market perception of the dollar,&quot; saysJavier Santalla, vice president, Nippon Credit Bank.   &quot;The dollar is only priced for a moderate recession,&quot; Mr.Santalla adds. So, a large drop in nonfarm payrolls suggeststhe dollar could be in for more weakness than expected, hesays.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold forcurrent delivery settled at $375.70 an ounce, up $2.70.Estimated volume was a moderate 3.4 million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Monday, gold was trading at $374.50 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
