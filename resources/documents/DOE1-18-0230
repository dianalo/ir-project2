The field data provide a basis for estimating theamount of insulation settling that occurs after installation. The fieldstudy has progressed through stages of increasing complexity to include:(1) density measurements 1 to 10 years after installation; (2) monitoringof insulation density and thickness with time, starting with installation;and (3) monitoring of insulation density and thickness with time, startingwith installation at densities near the manufacturer's recommended value.The first part of the study revealed unexpectedly high insulation densities.The latter parts of the study have shown that settling continues forabout 2 years after installation. Sufficient data were collected to constructcorrelations that can be used to predict final thickness or density valuesfor the products that were tested. The mineral fiber insulations installednear label density showed thickness loss in the range of 6 to 7% whileproducts installed at densities 20% or more above the manufacturer'srecommended value did not settle. Data obtained for loose-fill cellulosicinsulation shows settling for at least 2 years that can be correlatedwith results from the blower-cyclone-shaker test for settled density.This report includes an analysis of the effect of settling on R-valueand correlations that are useful for calculating R-values from thicknessand density measurements.</TEXT></DOC>
