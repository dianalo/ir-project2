The National Association of Attorneys General adopted guidelinesthis week aimed at encouraging more accurate price disclosure andadvertising by the rental companies.   The group issued the guidelines after their annual meeting inWashington ended Tuesday, and after reviewing the proposals with carrental companies.   ``Our investigation uncovered major and pervasive problems in theadvertising and pricing practices throughout the car rentalindustry,'' Robert Stephan, Kansas attorney general, said Wednesday.``In all too many instances, consumers have found it virtuallyimpossible to rent an automobile for the price trumpeted in therental company's ads.''   Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan said his state isconsidering filing a lawsuit over allegedly misleading advertisingby car rental companies.   He said that when the attorneys generals' task force beganlooking into the rental practices a year ago, ``rental car adsroutinely promised low prices that were in fact a complete fiction,with a bewildering variety of surcharges, fees and other mandatoryadd-ons that drove the final price much higher.''   Stephan said the industry has since moved to improve advertisingand eliminate misleading information on prices.   The guidelines are voluntary and intended to advance uniformenforcement by providing guidance for the states in enforcing theirown consumer protection laws, and for the companies to avoidviolating state consumer laws.   Under the guidelines:   _Mandatory fees, such as fuel surcharges, must be included in theadvertised price of a car.   _Advertised prices must ``clearly and conspicuously'' disclosekey restrictions and conditions, such as geographic or timelimitations on price, requirements for advance payment, and the costof collision damage waivers.   _Companies must maintain enough cars available at the advertisedprice to meet reasonably expected demand, unless the ad clearlystates supply is limited.   The group's task force that investigated car rentals said itfound a series of ``deceptive, unfair or unconscionable practices''involving the waivers, including pressure to purchase them by rentalagents who made commissions on the sale.   In many cases, a driver's personal insurance would cover repairs.   The attorneys general recommended state legislatures adopt one ofthree proposed reforms:   _Prohibit the practice of charging for accidental damage ortheft, thus eliminating the need for the waivers.   _Limit the amount of money for which consumers can be held liableto $500 or less.   _Require the cost of waivers to be regulated by the state throughits insurance department or other regulatory agency.   New York Attorney General Robert Abrams said the guidelines hadbeen reviewed by the car rental industry and that the industrygenerally had no objection.   Joe Russo, spokesman for Hertz Corp., the largest car rentalcompany, said it supports the proposed guideline and said it willpermit comparison shopping. Demetria Mudar, spokeswoman for AvisInc., the second largest rental company, said it supports theguidelines.</TEXT></DOC>
