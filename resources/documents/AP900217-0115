The plan would virtually obliterate her Hegewisch neighborhoodon Chicago's far southeast side.   Hegewisch _ an old steel mill neighborhood separated from thecity by stretches of landfills, factories and vacant lots _ is oneof two neighborhoods and two suburbs where 6,700 homes and 47businesses would be demolished to make way for the proposed LakeCalumet Airport.   ``We have all this land everywhere and they still have toflatten this town,'' Kolojay said, while working a cash register ata local food store.   ``Why not Bridgeport?'' said resident Mike Hennessy, referringto Daley's neighborhood.   Daley said the $4.9 billion project would rejuvenate an areaimpoverished over the last decade by the decline of the mills andother industry. He said the airport would generate 200,000 jobs and$13.7 billion in annual revenue.   The airport, scheduled to open in 2010, would be 20 percentlarger than O'Hare International Airport on the city's farnorthwest side and 15 times the size of Midway Airport, southwestof Chicago.   O'Hare has been criticized by federal officials as beingovercrowded and the cause of national travel delays. The questionof a third airport has been under debate for months and four othersites have been proposed.   Federal Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner and IllinoisGov. James R. Thompson said that Daley's proposal, unveiledThursday, will be considered with the others.   ``We are a long way from having a third airport,'' said GregoryBaise, chairman of a three-state committee conducting a $6 million,study to pick a rural south suburban site. ``I would view (Daley's)plan very skeptically.''</TEXT></DOC>
