On a time scale of millennia, the data agree with otherpaleohydrologic records from sub-Saharan east Africa. Time-series analysisof both data sets reveal periods of about 270, 200, 165, and 100 yr.The thickness data suggest additional periods of about 78, 44, 31, 25,and possibly 20 yr. The sediments consist of laminated light and darkcouplets, which are interpreted as a response to an average 4-yr variabilityin the hydrology of the Ethiopian Plateau. The authors suggest that thismay be a feedback from the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.</TEXT></DOC>
