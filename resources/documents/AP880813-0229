The yield of the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond roseFriday to 9.42 percent, its highest point since 9.44 percent onDec. 11, 1987, rounding out a bad string of performances for thebond market.   ``It's just been a lousy week,'' said Mitchell Held, chieffinancial economist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., referringto the slide in the bond market.   Inflation fears made for a bad week on Wall Street as well. TheDow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 1.78 to 2,037.52,extending its loss for the week to 81.61 points.   The dollar was mixed Friday against major foreign currencies,while oil futures prices declined.   In another indication of rising rates, a nationwide surveyFriday found interest rates on new one-year, adjustable-ratemortgages surged this week to 8 percent, the highest level sincelast November.   Fixed-rate mortgages jumped to 10.57 percent, just below thepeak of of late May and early June, according to the survey by theFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.   On the inflation front, the Labor Department said the 0.5percent rise in its Producer Price Index in July occurred in spiteof smaller increases in food prices. That compared with a rise of0.4 percent in June.   Analysts were concerned that, unlike previous months, thebiggest increases were not in the normally highly volatile food andenergy sectors but across a wide spectrum of consumer and capitalgoods.   Drugs, men's clothing, tires, soaps, cosmetics, home electronicequipment, glassware, tobacco products and construction equipmentall rose at annualized inflation rates in the double digits.   ``These prices will slow down, but something else ... will pickup the slack,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of economicforecasting at Georgia State University. ``There's a lot ofinflation kicking around.''   Ratajczak predicted the August figures will look even worse whenthey come out next month as energy prices rebound and the impact ofthe Farm Belt drought wends its way through the food productionprocess.   Consumer food prices on the wholesale level rose just 0.4percent in July. The price decline was led by falling meat costs asdrought-plagued farmers and ranchers rushed their herds toslaughter rather than continue feeding them high-cost grains.   In a related report on the inflationary front, the CommerceDepartment reported Friday business inventories rose 0.7 percent inJune despite a 1.5 percent increase in sales.   That indicated some businesses were stocking up on inventoriesto beat expected price increases, said Allen Sinai of the BostonCo., a money management firm.</TEXT></DOC>
