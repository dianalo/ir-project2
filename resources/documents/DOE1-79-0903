<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-79-0903 </DOCNO><TEXT>A popular component of the annual Short Course in Medical and ExperimentalMammalian Genetics each summer at the Jackson Laboratory has been the&quot;mouse clinic,&quot; At this &quot;clinic,&quot; the interested student is shown representativeexamples of mouse mutations considered to be of biomedical significance.On display are single gene mutations that cause anemias, obesity, diabetes,disorders, endocrinopathies, muscular and neurologic defects, immunodeficiency,autoimmunity, X-linked disorders, and a variety of miscellaneous defectsincluding those involving bone, connective tissue, hair, skin, and numerousother specific organs. Although many of the students taking the coursehave primary interests in human medicine and genetics, the course teachesthem an appreciation of the mouse as more genetically defined experimentalsystem. Consequently, during the &quot;mouse clinic&quot;, it is not unusual ofclinically oriented students to be drawn to the exhibit showing mousemutants that share some characteristics with the human genetic diseasesyndromes of interest to them. For example, an endocrinologist treatingpatients with Prader-Willi syndrome might go to the display of singlegene mutations producing obesity and dwarfism syndromes and inquire:&quot;What do you have that produces Prader-Willi syndrome in mice?&quot; Suchquestioners usually walk away with their quest unfulfilled; a given mousemodel seldom provides the clinician with exactly the same symptomatologythat one is accustomed to finding in the patient. The purpose of thischapter is to describe how mouse models of genetic diseases are discoveredand what their value and limitations are as models for an analogous orhomologous condition in humans.</TEXT></DOC>
