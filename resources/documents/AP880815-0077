Waves of troopers in green combat fatigues and black visoredhelmets charged the students as they tried to march out of YonseiUniversity in western Seoul. Police armored vans also fired salvosof tear gas bombs into the screaming students.   ``Unite the fatherland'' and ``Yankee go home,'' students yelled.   Police dragged away about 200 students, some of them screamingwith fear and pain. The unresisting students huddled in groups onthe ground, clinging to each other as troopers beat them with fistsand even riot shields.   Senior police officers hit and slapped their own men to try tostop the beatings.   President Roh Tae-woo, in a speech today to mark IndependenceDay, called radical students a threat to next month's SummerOlympics and said disorder would not be tolerated.   ``The people and the government will not forgive anyone whospoils the (Olympic) festival through mob action or the throwing offirebombs,'' he said.   The students tried to march out of the college three times, butwere beaten back by police. Marchers did not try to fight back,except when police pushed deep into the campus and studentsattacked them with clubs and rocks.   They apparently decided not to resist initially and letthemselves be arrested, departing from their normal tactic of beingfirst to start violence. Some said they volunteered to be arrested.   About 3,000 students had assembled on the campus to try to march35 miles north to the border truce site of Panmunjom for talks withNorth Korean student delegates on reuniting the divided Koreanpeninsula. The government banned the march and deployed 25,000 riotpolice in Seoul to stop it.   The North Korean students waited for two hours in Panmonjumtoday but left when the South Korean students failed to arrive,according to a report by the North's official Korean Central NewsAgency. It was monitored in Tokyo.   The South Korean radical students, a small but powerful minorityon campuses, have virtually no public support and protests lastweek attracted just a few thousand people. Still, Koreans fear thatviolent protests by the radicals could cast a shadow over theOlympics.   After the march was blocked, students regrouped on the campusand surged out with firebombs and rocks to battle the 7,000 riotpolice around the school. Police vans blasted tear gas bombs andboth sides pelted each other with rocks.   Police had few problems containing the students. Students wereunable to get past troopers surrounding the university.   Hundreds of students tried to stage protests in other parts ofSeoul or get to train stations to reach the border. But riot policequickly broke up protests and seized scores of radicals.   Roads leading to the border were also blocked by riot police.   A similar attempt to march to Panmunjom on June 10 was blockedby police, and the turnout for today's march appeared considerablysmaller.   Student leaders told a rally before trying to march out ofYonsei that the radicals would not stop trying to oust the Rohgovernment and reunite the two Koreas.   Dozens of students cut their fingers with razors and wroteslogans in blood.   ``We will never give up until we have destroyed the militarydictatorship and reunited our nation,'' one leader said.   The radicals also denounced the United States, saying Washingtonsupports military rule in South Korea. They demanded the withdrawalof the 42,000 U.S. troops based here under a treaty.   Two American leftists, Sue Bailey of Washington D.C., andCharles Scheiner of White Plains, N.Y., told the rally they broughtmessages of support from radicals in the United States. They toldthe students millions of Americans support their struggle and wantU.S. troops out of South Korea.   President Roh called for greater efforts to ease tension betweenNorth and South Korea. He proposed reunification talks with NorthKorean President Kim Il Sung.   Similar proposals in the past have not led to talks, but the twoKoreas are considering parliamentary talks on easing tension. Afirst meeting may be held at Panmunjom on Friday.   Radical students have seized on the reunification issue to tryto mobilize public support for their anti-government campaign.   The students say they are not communists, but insist that thepeninsula must be reunited immediately with political differencesto be worked out later. Most South Koreans fear the North isdetermined to conquer them.   The peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of WorldWar II. North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to start the KoreanWar, which ended three years later without a political solution.</TEXT></DOC>
