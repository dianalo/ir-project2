For money managers, it's a fashionable investment idea. Recently, they've been buying an unlikely anti-cholesterol play: Procter andamp; Gamble.    Pandamp;G shares have had a big run in the past week amid speculation that Metamucil, Pandamp;G's old standby fiber laxative, may soon be shown to reduce cholesterol levels.    A few traders who are loading up on Pandamp;G shares have even been shorting Merck, which is developing a high-powered anticholesterol drug called lovastatin. These traders suggest the laxative might steal future sales from Merck, though doctors scoff at such an idea.    Metamucil is made from natural fiber. Dietary fiber helps to control cholesterol levels. But speculators admit they aren't sure whether the laxative can be taken for prolonged periods, or if it works better than, say, oatmeal.    &quot;Cholesterol is trendy,&quot; says Marjorie Corp of One Federal Asset Management. &quot;It's very pervasive.&quot; Analysts say there could be a $5 billion market for anticholesterol remedies in a few years.    Although Metamucil is a laxative, a Pandamp;G spokeswoman says doctors report that some patients have swallowed it daily for 15 years without getting diarrhea. She won't talk about Metamucil's supposed wonder-drug potential. But she says that &quot;a noted university researcher&quot; will report the result of clinical studies involving the laxative at a March 31 meeting of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Washington, D.C.    The researcher, James Anderson of the V.A. Medical Center in Lexington, Ky., isn't saying Metamucil will change the world. He says it's easier to tolerate than other fiber supplements and could be &quot;a tool&quot; to lead patients &quot;to a better diet.&quot;    Starting two years ago, he put patients on Metamucil for eight-week periods. Cholesterol levels &quot;promptly&quot; dropped about 14%, he says. He hopes people would graduate from Metamucil treatments to eating more oatmeal and beans; cholesterol &quot;goes back up if you go off a high-fiber diet.&quot; People with higher cholesterol levels might, in addition, keep taking Metamucil, he says.    A healthy diet is many doctors' first choice because potent drugs can have potent side effects. But Daniel Steinberg of the University of California in San Diego says high-fiber diets are secondary in controlling cholesterol to cutting intake of saturated fats. &quot;Even the best diets don't work&quot; if high cholesterol is genetically determined, he adds.    Drug industry people don't expect Metamucil to steal sales from Merck's lovastatin or similar drugs. Lovastatin is meant for serious cases and has been shown to cut cholesterol levels 30% to 40%. Federal regulators recently gave it preliminary approval and it should be available in late 1987 or early 1988, analysts say.    The Metamucil craze started last week when Hercules Segalas, a Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst, told clients Pandamp;G might start promoting the laxative as an anticholesterol aid. From only 86 a week ago, Pandamp;G shares shot up to 91 3/4 yesterday.    The 5 3/4-point runup has added $970 million to Pandamp;G's total market value. It means investors are paying almost 29 times the additional $35 million annual profit that Mr. Segalas expects to come from Metamucil in the future. They shouldn't pay more than a market multiple of 13, says John Curran of Curran Capital Management.    Metamucil, Mr. Segalas acknowledges, is a tiny part of Pandamp;G, generating estimated sales of $125 million and net profit of $15 million. By 1989, sales might be $300 million and profit $50 million, he says. But he projects total sales for Pandamp;G of $19 billion and profit of $1 billion in the year ending in June 1988.    &quot;Even if Metamucil is perfect, it's not a reason to buy the stock,&quot; says Hugh Zurkuhlen of Salomon Brothers.    Pandamp;G won't say whether it will apply for a drug license for Metamucil, which would allow it to make a new medical claim for the product. Without a license, industry sources say, Pandamp;G might have to promote Metamucil's anticholesterol benefits indirectly: Studies show natural fibers might help reduce cholesterol in some cases, and Metamucil is one way to get fiber.    &quot;You know how convincing that sounds,&quot; says One Federal's Ms. Corp. But she likes Pandamp;G, which is still a relatively cheap stock. She thinks there are signs of regeneration at Pandamp;G after some sluggish years. Besides Metamucil, Pandamp;G is developing another product aimed at cholesterol sufferers, sucrose polyester, but hasn't yet filed a new-drug application.    Mr. Segalas is due to appear on &quot;Wall Street Week,&quot; the television program, this Friday, and might talk about Metamucil. He isn't &quot;trying to hype&quot; the laxative, he says, only to call attention to the fact that Pandamp;G isn't just a seller of detergents and diapers.    ---   Procter andamp; Gamble   (NYSE; Symbol: PG)   Business: Household products   Year ended, June 30, 1986*   Revenue: $15.44 billion   Earnings: $709 million, or $4.20 a share    Second quarter, Dec. 31, 1986   Per-share earnings: $1.11 vs. 99 cents.
