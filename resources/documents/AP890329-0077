(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's firstlicensed, private spaceship blasted off into the morning sky todayon a suborbital flight lasting 15 minutes.   The Consort 1 payload of scientific experiments went throughmore than seven minutes of near weightlessness after the 8:42 a.m.launch. The craft climbed 198 miles above Earth and landed about 50miles north of the launch pad.   ``We've been working a long time to put up a successfullaunch,'' said a jubilant Bill Vance, vice president of finance andadministration for Space Service Inc., which launched thecommercial rocket. ``It's the first of many, and we think its areal breakthrough.''   Spectators cheered as the slender, white rocket shot into thecloudless sky, leaving a white vapor trail.   The 100 people who gathered 1{ miles from the launch pad didn'thear the rocket's whoosh until it dropped its first stage, sixseconds and more than a mile into the flight. The rocketdisappeared from view in 25 seconds.   The voyage was a small step by the standards of previous spacetravel but a giant leap for the fledgling private spacecraftindustry, observers inside and outside the government believe.   In the 1990s, private companies are expected to begin puttingsatellites into orbit as the federal government gets out of thebusiness.   The federal government began to realize the potential of theprivate space industry after the successful September 1982 launchof the Conestoga 1 rocket with a dummy payload from MatagordaIsland, Texas, officials said.   But Space Services Inc., the Houston-based company responsiblefor both the Conestoga and Consort rockets, had to deal with 18federal agencies in its quest to fire Conestoga 1 because there wasno precedent for the flight.   That prompted the federal government to assign the Department ofTransportation the task of licensing private launches and helpingcut red tape. The Consort 1 is the first commercial ship licensedby the department.   The government felt more pressure to foster private launchesafter the disaster of the space shuttle Challenger in January 1986,said Ray Whitten of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration's office for commercial programs.   The Transportation Department expects to process 10 launchlicenses this year, said Carol Lane, director of the agency'scommercial space transportation department.   Five companies are offering launch services and Florida, Hawaiiand Virginia are considering offering private spaceports, she said.   Space Services sees suborbital flights like the Consort 1 asonly a beginning and plans orbital flights in the future, spokesmanMark Daniels said.   ``The orbital business is where we'll make the big bucks,'' hesaid.   Consort 1 is estimated to cost $1 million to $2 million. Danielssaid he expects to see Space Services generate annual revenues of$100 million to $500 million once it starts sending satellites intoorbit in the next decade.   The Consort 1's 650-pound payload was assembled by theUniversity of Alabama-Huntsville's Consortium for MaterialsDevelopment in Space, one of 16 commercial development consortiumssponsored by NASA.   It includes experiments designed to measure how liquids mix inweightlessness, how plastic foam forms and cures, how liquids coatglass surfaces, how epoxy reacts in weightlessness and how finelypowdered metals bond under high temperature to produce alloys.   The experiments have applications in medicine, the manufactureof metal alloys and in construction of space stations.   Consort 1 was boosted into space by a modified Terrier Navyrocket; the second stage is a Black Brant rocket. The entirevehicle stands about 52 feet and weighs 6,000 pounds at liftoff.</TEXT></DOC>
