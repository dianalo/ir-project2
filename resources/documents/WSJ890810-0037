In the year-earlier period, the company had a loss of $61.7 million. Revenue rose 39% to $120.1 million from $73.1 million.    The heavy investment is being financed by a huge amount of debt. Interest expense amounted to $64.4 million in the quarter, up from $45 million the year earlier. Cellular service revenue jumped 77% to $83.7 million, with the number of cellular subscribers increasing 30% to 336,000 as of June 30.    In the first half, the loss widened to $185.2 million from $123.1 million a year earlier. Revenue increased 58% to $222.2 million, from $141.1 million.    The wider loss, which was expected, was announced after the close of national over-the-counter trading yesterday when McCaw fell 25 cents to $37 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
