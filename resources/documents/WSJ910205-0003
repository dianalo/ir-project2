Long-term Treasury bond yields sank to 8.04% yesterday,the lowest level in more than a year and down from 8.09%Friday. As recently as late August, Treasury bonds yielded9.17%.</LP><TEXT>   Treasury bond prices, which move in the opposite directionfrom yields, gained more than 1/2 point, or over $5 for each$1,000 face amount. That came in addition to Friday's surgeof nearly 1 3/8 points.   Corporate bond yields also fell and prices rose,encouraging more companies to raise money by selling new debtissues. Nearly $1 billion of new corporate debt was sold toinvestors. That came in addition to $2.6 billion Friday.   Yesterday's bond rally came even though the governmenttoday begins a huge three-part sale of notes and bondstotaling $34.5 billion. The Treasury will sell new three-yearnotes, which are expected to yield around 7%.   Bond prices often fall just before these massive Treasuryfinancing operations. But any fears about the government'shuge borrowing needs were overshadowed by growing speculationthat the Fed will reduce rates further in coming months toprevent the recession from spreading.   Fed officials face intense pressure from the White Houseto cut rates. Bond investors are &quot;jumping on the bandwagonbecause the economy is even weaker than they thought andbecause they're afraid of missing a big rally,&quot; said EdwardA. Treichel, a vice president at Van Kampen MerrittInvestment Advisory Corp.   Shortly after the Labor Department released anunexpectedly gloomy employment report Friday, the Fedannounced a cut in its discount rate, the rate it charges onloans to banks and other financial institutions. The Fed cutthe rate to 6% from 6.5%. The Fed also pumped enough moneyinto the banking system to drive down the federal funds rateto 6.25% from 6.75%. The funds rate, which is the rate bankscharge on overnight loans to one another, heavily influencesmany other rates.   Short-term rates continued to drop. For example, rates onnew short-term Treasury bills at the government's regularweekly sale fell to their lowest auction levels in nearlythree years. The average yield on new three-month billsdropped to 6.15%, the lowest since April 1988.   The drop in rates spread beyond the bond market, bringinglower rates on mortgages. In Washington, the VeteransAdministration cut its key mortgage ceiling rate to 9% from9.5%, effective today. The reduction brought the VA ratebelow 9.5% for the first time in nearly four years.   Also, more big banks cut their prime lending rate to 9%from 9.5%, following the lead of several large banks Friday.The prime rate is watched closely because banks use it as abenchmark for loans to many small and medium-sizedbusinesses. It also is used to peg rates on home-equityloans.   Because of the economy's continued weakness, the Fedprobably will cut short-term interest rates &quot;by at leastanother half a percentage point by this spring,&quot; said MariaFiorini Ramirez, president of Maria Ramirez CapitalConsultants Inc. She said individual investors seeking safetyand capital gains should consider buying the three-yearTreasury notes to be auctioned today.   The Federal Reserve's policy committee meets today andtomorrow in Washington to review its strategy.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasury bond prices surged again, as the benchmark30-year bond's price rose to 107 30/32 from 107 11/32 lateFriday. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction fromthe price, fell to 8.04% from 8.09%.   Today, the Treasury begins its three-part quarterlyfinancing operation with a sale of three-year notes. Lateyesterday, the three-year notes were quoted in when-issuedtrading at a yield of 6.99%. The 10-year notes to be soldtomorrow were quoted in when-issued trading at 7.83%.   The Treasury sold new short-term bills yesterday at thelowest yields since early 1988. The average discount rate onthe 13-week bills was 5.97%, which translates into a yield of6.15%. The average rate on new 26-week bills was 5.94%, for ayield of 6.21%.   Here are additional details of yesterday's Treasury billauction:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it. Thepercentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while thecoupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                                                                                                                      13-Week           26-Week                                                                                                          Applications .......... $31,538,325,000   $33,515,270,000   Accepted bids ......... $10,011,040,000   $10,057,845,000   Accepted at low price .             66%               61%   Accepted noncompet'ly .  $1,850,945,000    $1,406,430,000   Average price (rate) ..  98.491 (5.97%)    96.997 (5.94%)   High price (rate) .....  98.501 (5.93%)    97.012 (5.91%)   Low price (rate) ......  98.491 (5.97%)    96.997 (5.94%)   Coupon equivalent .....           6.15%             6.21%                                                                                                          Both issues are dated Feb. 7, 1991. The 13-week billsmature May 9, 1991, and the 26-week bills mature Aug. 8,1991.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          Corporate treasurers, eager to take advantage of lowerinterest rates, continued their borrowing spree.   Among the biggest borrowers was Du Pont Co. TheWilmington, Del., chemical company sold $300 million of12-year notes priced to yield 8.50%, or 0.62 percentage pointabove the Treasury's 10-year note.   Timothy Skidmore, senior financial analyst at Du Pont,said the notes, which are callable after 10 years, leave thecompany some flexibility to refinance if rates are lowerthen. As rates head lower, Du Pont plans to extend thematurities of its debt issues, he said.   Elsewhere in the corporate sector, prices of bank bondsclimbed in tandem with a strong rally in bank and financialstocks. The sector got a boost Friday when the FederalReserve cut its discount rate.   Corporate bond traders said that while issues from majorbanks were higher in thin trading, the biggest gains came inbonds of recently depressed Northeast banks. &quot;The bottom endof the market was stronger,&quot; said Thomas Quigley, a corporatebond trader at Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp.   For instance, Shawmut National Corp.'s 8.125% notesmaturing in 1997 soared five points to 39, and MidlanticBanks Inc.'s 11.35% notes due in 1993 surged 4 1/2 to 73 1/2.   In the junk-bond market, prices of speculative-gradesecurities with low credit ratings or no credit ratings atall advanced an average of 1/4 point.   Among the leaders, RJR Nabisco Inc.'s 17.375% convertiblepay-in-kind debentures due in 2009 soared 4 1/2 points to 119on the New York Stock Exchange. Pay-in-kind issues payinterest in the form of additional securities instead ofcash.   On the other hand, Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.'s 12.25%senior subordinated notes due in 1996 fell three points to38.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          New York City bond prices rose and yields fell on newsthat Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. affirmed its single-A-minusrating on the city's approximately $15 billion of generalobligation debt.   Sandamp;P also took the city's bonds off its CreditWatchsurveillance list. One trader late yesterday quoted New YorkCity bonds due in 26 years at a yield of about 8.45%, downfrom 8.49% late Friday.   Elsewhere in the market, municipal bonds ended littlechanged to 1/4 point higher. The New Jersey TurnpikeAuthority's 7.20% securities of 2018 rose 1/4 point to 1001/4, to yield 7.17%.</TEXT></DOC>
