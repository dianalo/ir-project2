In an internal memorandum obtained by The Associated Press onFriday, Watkins told the department's No. 3 official, John Tuck, toassume temporarily the added title of head of defense programs,which runs the nuclear weapons system.   The defense programs office has been without a permanentdirector for more than a year.   ``The vital national security mission of the department can nolonger be carried out under the current management arrangement,''Watkins wrote, adding that Tuck's assignment was designed to givethe office ``leadership and direction.''   The central problem for Watkins is that his choice to bepermanent head of the weapons office, Victor Stello, has beenunable to gain Senate confirmation.   Stello was nominated by the White House in July, but aconfirmation hearing by the Senate Armed Services Committee has notbeen scheduled.   Stello has been sharply criticized by environmentalists and somemembers of Congress for being lax on nuclear safety, although hecalls the charge unfair.   Watkins said he hoped the Stello nomination would be acted uponsoon, but one environmental group opposed to Stello said itappeared Watkins was anticipating the possibility that Stelloeither would be blocked by Congress or dropped by the White House.   ``He's doomed,'' said Stephen Schwartz, a spokesman forGreenpeace U.S.A.   Also Friday, Watkins announced the resignation of Robert O.Hunter Jr. as director of the office of energy research. Hunter haddrawn criticism in some scientific circles for his efforts torestructure the department's fusion research program.   No replacement was announced.   In a related development, advisers told Watkins on Friday thatthe department may be moving too quickly in its plans forrestarting the three idled Savannah River nuclear reactors thatproduce a gas needed in nuclear warheads.   In a letter to Watkins, members of the Advisory Committee onNuclear Facility Safety said that while prospects for a saferesumption of production at Savannah River had improved in recentmonths, a number of serious problems remained.   The chief concern was that training of Westinghouse Corp.workers who operate the reactors has not included ``reactorfundamentals'' learned by operators of commercial nuclear reactors.Westinghouse runs Savannah River under a government contract.   The Savannah River reactors, built for the government in theearly 1950s, were closed down more 18 months ago because ofmechanical problems and safety concerns. Among the major issues inplanning a restart is whether the operators are adequately trainedand whether Westinghouse puts enough emphasis on safety.   The advisers told Watkins that while restart planning wasgenerally good, the absence of operator training in reactorfundamentals was a serious problem.   ``That this omission will remain through restart may belieWestinghouse's claim that safety is their primary concern and thatearly restart of the reactors is not the driving factor intraining,'' the letter said.   In addition, the committee members said Watkins may be bitingoff more than he can chew in trying to get all three idled reactorsback in operation within a six-month period starting next summer orfall.   It might be wiser, they said, to focus all the best availabletalent on restarting one reactor before focusing on another.</TEXT></DOC>
