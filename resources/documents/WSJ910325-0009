Both the latestand earlier-year periods included a $20 million tax-losscarry-forward.   Revenue for the latest year rose about 26%, to $7.3million from $5.2 million, the company said.   Alexander Energy said it boosted its oil production by17.5% and its natural gas production by about 25% last year,primarily on the strength of increased exploration andacquisitions. It said it expects to increase its totalreserves an additional 20% this year.   The company said it expects its reserve base to be furtherenhanced by the inclusion of anticipated production fromthree areas in Texas and Oklahoma where it is in the earlystages of exploration and production programs. It said it isespecially optimistic about a 13,000-acre lease site south ofSan Antonio in the Austin Chalk area. The company is awaitingtest results from a well that &quot;if it does as well as we thinkit will, it will be the battleship of the fleet,&quot; Mr.Alexander said in an interview.   Plans call for drilling a total of 85 wells in the threeareas over the next three-to-four years.   Roughly 60% of the company's reserves are natural gas.   &quot;We are more interested in finding good, long-life gasreserves,&quot; Mr. Alexander said. &quot;We simply think natural gaswill do better in terms of prices in the next 10 years thanoil. There will be a bigger demand.&quot;   Alexander Energy is also working on two acquisitions thatjointly would give the company an additional 600,000 barrelsof oil equivalent and an introduction into the natural gaspipeline industry. The company already has interests in agas-gathering system in the Arkoma Basin, an area borderingArkansas and Oklahoma. It wouldn't disclose details of theproposed acquisitions, which it said would probably beaccomplished through a stock-swap merger or using bankfinancing.   Completion of those acquisitions would increase cash flow30% or 40% or an additional $1.5 million in 1991, whileboosting net income about 20% or another $150,000, Mr.Alexander said.</TEXT></DOC>
