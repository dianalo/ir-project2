Tirello Jr., utility analyst with Smith Barney,Harris Upham andamp; Co., said the acquisition would double theassets of the PGandamp;E Enterprises unit to about $829 million.(PGandamp;E Resources is a subsidiary of PGandamp;E Enterprises, whichwas formed in 1988 to hold the company's nonutility assets.)   Joseph T. Williams, president of PGandamp;E Resources, said theacquisition will make the company &quot;one of the larger and moreactive independent oil and gas exploration and productioncompanies in the U.S.&quot; Pacific Gas andamp; Electric is one of thenation's largest investor-owned utilities.   TEX/CON said it has proved and probable reserves of 30.4million barrels of oil and 317.9 billion cubic feet of gas.Other TEX/CON assets include an onshore U.S. seismic database of about 76,000 miles and 185,000 net acres ofundeveloped leases.   Douglas W. Preiser, utility analyst for Kidder, Peabody andamp;Co., said several utilities are already in the natural gasbusiness or &quot;actively trying to get into the business.&quot; Theysee the prices of gas assets &quot;at reasonable levels, and theyare looking to buy them as investments for the future,&quot; hesaid. &quot;Utilities are big buyers of fuel and they understandthe marketplace for that fuel.&quot;   Mason Willrich, president of PGandamp;E Enterprises, said thecompany believes it is a &quot;good time to add reserves throughacquisition since gas prices are very low. We think we are ator near the bottom of a cycle,&quot; he said. &quot;With moderate priceincreases in the future, we think we will do very well.&quot;   British Petroleum's BP Exploration unit previouslyannounced the sale of TEX/CON's gas transmission andmarketing business to Transok, a subsidiary of Central andamp;South West Corp., Dallas. Assets remaining in TEX/CON afterthe Transok transaction consist of the concern's oil and gasexploration and production business.   PGandamp;E Enterprises is involved in a joint venture withBechtel Corp. to develop independent power projects outsideCalifornia and has real estate development interests inCalifornia besides its oil and gas exploration and productionoperations.   A spokesman said PGandamp;E Enterprises isn't expected to addsubstantially to the parent company's earnings until themid-1990s.</TEXT></DOC>
