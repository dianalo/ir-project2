Circle said it plans to acquire Overland, another truck carrier, through a stock swap valued at about $8.1 million. It has agreed to buy closely held Continental for an indicated total of $50.7 million in cash and stock. Continental, however, won't receive a stock swap for the 30% of Overland's 1.7 million shares it owns; instead, they will become treasury shares, Circle said. All three companies are based in Indianapolis.    The acquisition of Overland will increase Circle's hauling capacity. Continental, which operates a truck driver training school, should enhance Circle's ability to get drivers at a time when groups such as the American Trucking Association are warning of severe driver shortages.    In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Circle shares closed at $12.50, up $1, and Overland shares closed at $6.75, down 37.5 cents.    Circle said Gary L. Eyler will remain chief executive officer of Overland and Continental, and will become chief operating officer of Circle. Mr. Eyler owns a controlling interest in Continental. Circle said it expects no major management changes at any of the companies. </TEXT></DOC>
