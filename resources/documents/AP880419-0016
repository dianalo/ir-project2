The State Department told the committee on Monday that theSoviet position was spelled out last week in a conversation betweenSecretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard A. Shevardnadze.   The dispute centers on the treaty signed Dec. 8 by PresidentReagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, eliminating nuclearmissiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles.   The Reagan administration said the treaty banned both existingmissiles and any ``futuristic'' weapons, such as those using lasersor beam rays, as long as the weapons had a range covered by thetreaty.   But critics, including members of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, questioned whether the Soviets might have a differentview of the treaty and suggested that the ambiguity should becleared up.   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the chairman of the ForeignRelations Committee, said Shevardnadze's ``unequivocal statementshould allay concerns that have been raised about this subject.''   Pell's committee sent the full Senate a report Monday that saidthe Senate should approve the treaty and protect its constitutionalrights by blocking presidential attempts to change the way treatiesare interpreted.   The 515-page report sums up the panel's three months of hearingsand its votes on the historic pact.   The report was approved by the same 17-2 majority whichrecommended two weeks ago that the treaty should be ratified by thefull Senate. The opposition votes were cast by Sens. Jesse Helms,R-N.C., and Larry Pressler, R-S.D.   Ratification requires a vote of 67 of the 100 senators. Leadersof both parties estimate that 90 or more senators will support theIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty when it finally comes to avote.   Publication of the committee report means the way is finallyclear for formal consideration on the Senate floor.   Republicans say the most contentious issue will likely be theDemocratic-backed amendment that would bar the United States fromchanging the interpretation of the INF treaty.   The amendment, approved 12-7 by the committee, arises from afight over the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   Reagan has asserted that the White House can unilaterally changehow the ABM pact is viewed, a move that would permit expanded``Star Wars'' testing, but congressional Democrats dispute thatclaim.   ``A presidential right to adopt a different interpretation of atreaty, irrespective of the understanding on which the Senate basedits consent, would tend to nullify the Senate's share of the treatypower and thus undermine a basic provision of the Constitution,''the report said.   ``The Senate's only recourse, to prevent its share of the treatypower being nullified, would be to attach elaborate and numerousconditions to treaties in order to have the Senate's understandingbecome an integral and explicit part of the ratificationdocuments,'' the report said.   ``Such procedures could easily overburden the treaty process tothe point of paralysis,'' it warned.</TEXT></DOC>
