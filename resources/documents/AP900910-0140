The strike is so swift the Khmer Rouge leavesbehind half-eaten meals and tons of arms as they flee.      _On Jan. 10, 1979, a new Communist government is proclaimed. Itis led by Heng Samrin and other Khmer Rouge defectors who had fledto Vietnam, fearing the previous government's bloody purges. Butsanctuary from Thailand and arms from China soon raise the KhmerRouge into a potent guerrilla insurgency.   _In January-February 1979, China wages a border war againstVietnam to ``punish'' it for the invasion of Cambodia.      _In June 1982, the Khmer Rouge, the forces of Prince NorodomSihanouk and those of former Premier Son Sann form a resistancecoalition. The United Nations recognizes it as Cambodia'sgovernment. _In March 1985, Vietnamese forces, allied to thegovernment in Phnom Penh, overrun every major border camp in theirgreatest victory of the war.   _In July 1987, Sihanouk holds peace talks in France with PhnomPenh's Prime Minister Hun Sen.      _On Dec. 19, 1988, Premier Li Peng says China will decrease itsaid to the resistance as Vietnam withdraws from Cambodia. He saysChina will halt all aid when the troops are gone.      _In December 1988, Vietnam begins its pullout of an estimated50,000 troops.   _In January 1989, Vietnam sends a senior official to Beijing todiscuss the conflict. The two sides agree that Vietnam willwithdraw its troops by September in exchange for an end to Chineseaid to the guerrillas.   _In July 1989, a 19-nation conference on Cambodia opens inParis. Sihanouk calls for an interim government with Khmer Rougeparticipation. Hun Sen opposes the idea.   _In September 1989, Vietnam says it has withdrawn its lasttroops. Guerrillas call it a sham and begin a general offensive.China calls the pullout a fraud and indicates it will continuearming the guerrillas until there is a political settlement.   _On Sept. 30, 1989, non-communist guerrillas seize the districtseat of Thmar Puok near the Thai border. They make their greatestgains in the war in the coming months.   _On Feb. 11-13, 1990, the U.N. Security Council's permanentmembers say regrouping the Cambodian armies into designated areasis essential to the peace process. But they fail to agree onproposals to disarm the factions. Sihanouk and Hun Sen hold talksin Bangkok, Thailand. They agree on the need for a U.N. presence inCambodia and a ``supreme national body'' to government the country.   _In April, Sihanouk urges an immediate cease-fire. He says theU.N. Security Council should deploy peacekeeping troops to enforceit.   _In June, Cambodian guerrillas launch major attacks and seizeareas of several provinces as Cambodia's warring factions prepareto meet to discuss a cease-fire. Chinese, Thai and U.S. officialsjoin attempts to foster progress in peace talks stalled by theKhmer Rouge's refusal to attend.   _In July, U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker announces thatWashington is withdrawing diplomatic recognition of the resistancecoalition because it includes the Khmer Rouge.   _On Sept. 5, Baker announces the United States will open directtalks for the first time with Hun Sen's government.
