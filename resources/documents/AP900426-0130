(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A smiling Robert Polhillreturned to American soil today after 39 months as a hostage inLebanon.   Polhill flashed a thumbs up sign and waved as he walked off theU.S. military plane that flew him to Andrews Air Force Base outsideWashington.   He quickly shook hands with a small welcoming delegation, thenwalked with his wife, Feryal, to a nearby car for a drive to WalterReed Army Hospital.   The 55-year-old business professor declined to talk toreporters, pointing to his throat as if to say he was not yet readyto speak.   Polhill's release left seven Americans among 17 Western hostagesstill held in Lebanon. The longest-held is American Terry Anderson,chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   AFN, the U.S. military's radio network, reported that a specialU.S. debriefing team that met with Polhill in West Germand earlierin the week had left Europe. The report gave rise to speculationthat another hostage release was not immediately expected.   Polhill was released by his captors in the Middle East on Sundayand underwent medical tests and intense debriefings at a U.S. AirForce Hospital in Wiesbaden. He was to undergo additional tests atWalter Reed.   His release left seven Americans among 17 Western hostages stillheld in Lebanon. The longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnappedMarch 16, 1985.   One U.S. source said the debriefing team was impressed with thevivid details that Polhill provided about the conditions andsurroundings in which he was held for 39 months in Lebanon.   On Wednesday, Hussein Musawi, the reputed spiritual mentor ofPolhill's captors, Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine,urged the kidnappers not to release another hostage because of aU.S. House of Representatives resolution declaring JerusalemIsrael's capital.   Syria today also sharply condemned the House resolution, sayingit was intended to emphasize the American desire to ``defy Arabsand Moslems by stealing their rights without any lawful orhistorical justification.''   In Iran, a radical newspaper said today that the resolutionwould delay the release of other Western hostages in Lebanon. TheFarsi-language Jomhuri Islami, or Islamic Republic, said it ``madethings more complicated by blocking the way for solving problems.''   On Wednesday, he visited with a kindergarten class of childrenof U.S. servicemen who had sent him a welcome-back card theydesigned featuring a teddy bear. In his first public appearancesince arriving on Monday, he posed for pictures on a hospitalbalcony with the 14 children.   Accompanied by his wife and his two sons, Polhill waved toreporters and kissed and hugged his wife.   The balcony was lined with American flags and draped with abanner saying: ``Welcome Home! Pray For The Others.''   About 75 servicemen, nurses, doctors and fellow patients cheeredPolhill, who clasped his hands over his head and held his fingershigh to form a victory sign.   Polhill, who quickly has become known for his good sense ofhumor _ something doctors say helped him endure captivity _bantered with his sons Stephen, 26, and Brian, 23.   ``I'm funnier than he is,'' Brian shouted.   Laughing, Polhill pointed to himself and gave a thumbs-up signand a thumbs-down sign to his sons, then spoke to them.   ``He says you're making him feel really wonderful _ thanks,''Brian shouted to the crowd of onlookers and reporters.   Kindergarten teacher Kim Miller said that during the five-minutevisit, Polhill gave each of the children a yellow flower, and theygave him pictures they had drawn.   ``He gave everybody a little hug and he thanked us for coming,''Mrs. Miller, of Upland, Calif., told reporters.   Polhill, a diabetic, lost 25 pounds during his captivity and wasvery tired when he was released Sunday.   Mrs. Miller said he still appeared weak on Wednesday and spokevery softly.   ``I told him that it was nice to have him back,'' said6-year-old Ricky Houser III from Youngstown, Ohio.   Wiesbaden City Manager Reinhold Edel visited Polhill earlier andformally welcomed him to the city with a case of local wine.Polhill said he hoped the case contained a reorder blank, militaryofficials said.   Polhill was abducted on Jan. 24, 1987, from the BeirutUniversity College campus along with two other U.S. academics,Alann Steen and Jesse Turner.   U.S. officials said Tuesday that Polhill shared a room withTurner and Steen and was probably in the same building as some ofthe other Western hostages held by the Moslem Shiite fundamentalistgroup Hezbollah, or Party of God.</TEXT></DOC>
