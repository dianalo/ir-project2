The government said the reports were sensational propaganda andlies.   The human rights group Africa Watch and other sources said theviolence occurred July 14 in Mogadishu, the capital of the EastAfrican nation, following the slaying of a Roman Catholic bishopand the arrests of Moslem religious leaders.   Africa Watch and the sources put the number killed during therioting at about 400 after soldiers opened fire on houses inresidential districts.   More than 1,000 people were injured, but many were afraid to goto the hospital for fear of arrest, said the human rights group ina statement released in Nairobi. The group has offices inWashington and London.   Throughout the evening of the riots and the following night,witnesses said soldiers went from house to house arresting men,raping women and looting. Africa Watch said about 2,000 people werearrested during the searches.   Forty-six people arrested two days after the riots were accusedin military courts of having participated in the violence, foundguilty and taken to a beach outside Mogadishu where they were shotto death, said Africa Watch.   The government has said 23 people died and 59 were injured inviolence it blamed on ``troublemakers.''   In Washington, the State Department said it was concerned aboutwhat it termed ``credible reports'' of executions in Somalia.   ``We are very disturbed by these reports,'' said spokesmanRichard Boucher. ``We are directing our embassy in Mogadishu toraise our concern with the Somali government and ask it to act toensure that civil liberties and human rights are fully protected.''   In September, the human rights group Amnesty International saidthe government of autocratic President Mohamed Siad Barre executedup to 1,000 civilians while trying to end an insurgency in thenorth. In response, the U.S. Congress froze $55 million in aid tothe impoverished nation.   The government has forbidden journalists from visiting Somaliasince heavy fighting broke out between government forces and thenorthern rebel Somali National Movement in 1988. Telecommunicationswith the country are difficult.   The Somali Embassy in Washington relayed a statement issued bythe Foreign Ministry in Mogadishu that said:   ``After last week's events in Mogadishu, enemies of the Somalipeople and their collaborators have been disseminating sensationalpropaganda, lies about the true situation in Somalia. The sourcesof such malicious disinformation are terrorist groups whoseultinmate motive is to spread chaos throughout the country.   ``The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Somali DemocraticRepublic wishes to state categorically that the situation inMogadishu is normal and (in) the country as a whole.''   Independent sources, who would not be identified for fear ofgovernment reprisals, corroborated much of the human rights group'sreport, including the executions.   The July 14 violence broke out after the arrests the previousday of four Moslem leaders and an unspecified number of civilians,according to the sources and Africa Watch.   Armed detachments surrounded Mogadishu's mosques in anticipationof protests and used physical and verbal abuse to disperseworshipers as they left, the sources and Africa Watch said.   Soldiers then opened fire on the worshipers who fought backprimarily with rocks and stones. In at least one neighborhood ofwestern Mogadishu, worshipers outnumbered security forces, seizedtheir weapons and returned fire, according to Africa Watch.   The army moved into the city with tanks and took over all majorgovernment buildings and crossroads and closed all roads fromMogadishu, according to Africa Watch.   In addition to the arrests of the Moslem leaders, the violenceappeared linked to the July 9 slaying of Mogadishu's Roman CatholicBishop Salvatore Colombo, an Italian who had lived in Somalia formore than 40 years, according to Africa Watch.   The government said Colombo was shot by a lone gunman. AfricaWatch said there was widespread suspicion in Mogadishu that Colombowas killed by government forces who suspected him of passinginformation about human rights abuses to foreign governments.   Moslem leaders are said to have been angry that the governmentoffered a $13,000 reward for information about Colombo's slayingbut showed little concern for the welfare of its own people, saidAfrica Watch.   Some residents, who reported a recent upsurge in anti-Christianand anti-white feeling in the capital, said Colombo was suspectedof trying to convert Moslem youth.   Scattered incidents of gunfire were reported in Mogadishu sincethe riots. A dusk-to-dawn curfew ordered after the clashes waseased Thursday to 9 p.m. to 5 a.m.   Somalia is populated by an estimated 6 million members of theSomali tribe, which is composed of about half a dozen clans.   Islam is the state religion in the impoverished pastoral nation,which is on the Horn of Africa and juts into the Indian Ocean tothe south and the Gulf of Aden to the north. There are about 2,000Roman Catholics in the nation.   Barre has ruled Somalia as a one-party state since 1969.
