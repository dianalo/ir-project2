Rep. Marvin Leath (D., Texas), leading the charge, states &quot;this does a lot to disrupt the system,&quot; though he doesn't dispute the health hazards posed by smoking.    Several years ago, a similar plan surfaced at the Pentagon, and Rep. Leath and other members of Congress quashed it through a direct appeal to then Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.    Congressional sources said that if similar tactics don't succeed this time, they'll try to overturn a tobacco ban through legislation early next year. The Pentagon said that at this point, the plan is only under consideration. </TEXT></DOC>
