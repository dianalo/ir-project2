Gen. Richard V. Secordpleaded guilty today to one count of lying to congressionalinvestigators in the Iran-Contra scandal.   Secord had been scheduled to go on trial next Monday on 12criminal charges, nine of them stemming from his testimony toCongress in 1987.   But at a pre-trial hearing, Iran-Contra prosecutor ReidWeingarten announced that the government and Secord's lawyers hadnegotiated a plea agreement. The government will seek dismissal ofthe other 11 criminal charges against Secord, who also could havefaced tax charges, prosecutors said.   ``No further criminal charges, including criminal tax charges,will be brought against the defendant based on information now knownto the Office of Independent Counsel relating to the Iran-Contraaffair,'' the plea agreement stated.   Prosecutors were prepared to present evidence that ``Secordpersonally received ... in excess of $1.5 million'' in profits fromthe sale of weapons to the Contras and Iran, the office ofindependent counsel Lawrence Walsh said in court papers.   Secord agreed to ``cooperate fully'' with Iran-Contra prosecutors``by testifying truthfully at any trial ... to which he may becalled,'' according to the plea agreement.   He could become a government witness against former nationalsecurity adviser John M. Poindexter, whose criminal trial isscheduled to begin Jan. 22. Poindexter is accused of obstructingCongress and giving false statements in various investigations.   Poindexter has told the judge in his case that his daily meetingswith then-President Reagan included discussions of Secord's role asa middleman in the transfer of arms to Iran. Poindexter is trying tosubpoena Reagan's notes and diaries.   Secord flew with Poindexter from Central America to the UnitedStates on April 20, 1986, after the two men reviewed problems inWhite House aide Oliver North's secret Contra re-supply network.   When they landed in Miami, Secord and Poindexter met with Northat the offices of Southern Air, a former CIA-owned company involvedin Contra re-supply, according to deposition testimony given toCongress by one of the participants in the operation.   Secord admitted in U.S. District Court that he made a falsestatement when he told congressional investigators on June 10, 1987,that he had not been aware any money from his business dealings inthe Iran-Contra affair went to White House aide Oliver North.   Secord told Judge Aubrey Robinson that he had paid for a $13,800security fence at North's home.   ``I should have known that they were aiming at the fence,''Secord said of the question by congressional investigators that ledto his false statement. Secord said his answer was ``a misguidedeffort to prevent further criticism,'' noting that there had``already been a firestorm in the press'' about who paid for North'ssecurity fence.   Secord said ``I was trying to shield both of us'' when he liedabout North's fence in his deposition to the congressionalinvestigators.   Secord could be sentenced to up to five years in prison.   Secord's profits for his work on the administration's Iran armssales and assisting the Contras ``exceed $1.5 million,'' prosecutorssaid in a recent court filing. Secord had been called into bothinitiatives by North.   The government presented a document listing the evidence it wouldhave presented at Secord's trial in support of the charge to whichhe pleaded guilty.   The document stated that in addition to Secord paying for thefence, there was an attempted cover-up of who paid for the fencethrough the use of back-dated documents.   Secord's attorney, Thomas Green, objected to that portion of thegovernment's evidence, saying Secord had not been involved in acover-up.   The document also said Secord and his business partner, AlbertHakim, had arranged to set aside $200,000 for an insurance fund forNorth's wife for the education of the North children.   The document said Secord told North that the money had been setaside.   In his congressional testimony in 1987, North testified that heknew nothing of the $200,000.   Secord's deal with prosecutors was first reported Tuesday nightby NBC-TV.   Secord was one of the first figures in the Iran-Contra affair tocooperate with the congressional investigation. He was the leadoffwitness in televised hearings in the summer of 1987 and testifiedwithout immunity from prosecution that was granted others, includingNorth.   Hakim and Secord were the middlemen in U.S.-Iran arms sales.Secord, an expert in covert operations, also helped North, then aNational Security Council aide, set up a secret arms supply networkto the Nicaraguan rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
