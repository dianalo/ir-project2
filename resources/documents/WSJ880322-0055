The firing of Subroto, who is also a member of OPEC's influential price-monitoring committee, occurred amid new disarray in world oil markets. Just yesterday, for instance, Saudi Arabian King Fahd officially confirmed that the kingdom has been pricing its oil in such a manner that it can produce up to its full production quota.    Although Saudi Arabia's flexible, market-related pricing has been widely known and reported, the king's comments sent oil prices reeling. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery closed at $16.50 a barrel, off nine cents on the day, but down 54 cents from a high of $17.03 earlier in the session.    With prices sliding and violence escalating anew in the Persian Gulf, &quot;this is not a good time from OPEC's point of view for Subroto to be yanked from the scene,&quot; said Brian Jacoboski, a senior oil analyst at PaineWebber Inc. who regularly attends OPEC meetings.    The 59-year-old Mr. Subroto, who spent 10 years as the head of Indonesia's OPEC delegation, recently helped to form a new centrist bloc that has been instrumental in controlling the strife within OPEC over the Iran-Iraq war. Along with the oil ministers from the non-Persian Gulf nations of Venezuela and Nigeria, Mr. Subroto prevented last December's meeting of the 13 OPEC ministers from collapsing in a severe dispute over the production quotas to be assigned to Iran and Iraq.    &quot;You've lost a strong moderating force in OPEC,&quot; said Bahman Karbassion, a consultant and former OPEC staff member. &quot;This was a man who could make a compromise.&quot;    In the shake-up of 19 cabinet ministers by Indonesian President Suharto, Mr. Subroto was succeeded by Ginandjar Kartasasmita, a 47-year-old first air marshal. &quot;Now you've got a first air marshal who's got to learn how to play the game from scratch, and that's definitiely a negative factor,&quot; said Joseph Story, president of Gulf Consulting Services in McLean, Va.    President Suharto swept out fully half his 38-member cabinet Monday after beginning his fifth term 10 days ago. He stressed that the incoming cabinet would ensure &quot;continuity&quot; in the way Indonesia is governed. And although the fired ministers included a number in prominent economic positions, Western business officials based in Indonesia expressed little anxiety over the new appointments.    A former university professor partial to bow ties, the soft-spoken Mr. Subroto -- often called &quot;the prof&quot; -- has been trying to defuse Persian Gulf politics in OPEC councils since the Iran-Iraq war erupted in 1980. As the host for a meeting in Bali, Indonesia, shortly after the war began, Mr. Subroto, then the president of OPEC, broke the protocol of alphabetical seating by placing Indonesia's delegation between those from Iran and Iraq. At the time, Iran's oil minister was a prisoner of war in Iraq; his delegation placed his photo in his empty chair at the conference table.    In recent days, Mr. Subroto had been more closely involved in addressing the decline of oil prices, carrying on an active consultation with fellow members of OPEC's five-member price-monitoring committee over whether to hold a meeting of the committee.    One of his colleagues on the committee, Rilwanu Lukman, the president of OPEC and the oil minister of Nigeria, is expected to hold a news conference today in Lagos, Nigeria, in an effort to stem the slide in world-wide oil prices.    Mr. Lukman may report OPEC's production figures for January as audited by a newly hired accounting firm. The figures are expected to show that OPEC produced roughly 14.4 million barrels a day during that month -- well below the 15.1 million-barrel-a-day ceiling set last December by all OPEC members except Iraq in the delicate compromise that Mr. Subroto helped to achieve.    But the January production figures don't include 250,000 barrels a day in the Neutral Zone, which is jointly controlled by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, or the oil output of Iraq, which totaled about 2.5 million barrels a day in the month. </TEXT></DOC>
