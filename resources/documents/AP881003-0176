(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Florida Democrats choose a candidateTuesday to oppose Republican Rep. Connie Mack III for the seatbeing vacated by three-term Sen. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat.   Only about one-fourth of the state's voters are expected to showup for the election featuring a runoff between longtime rivals BillGunter, 54, and Rep. Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay, 55.   It's Gunter's third try for the Senate and the second forMacKay, a former state legislator serving his third term in theU.S. House.   Gunter, Florida's insurance commissioner since 1976,unsuccessfully sought his party's nomination in 1974. He won theDemocratic primary and runoff in 1980 before losing to RepublicanPaula Hawkins in the general election.   MacKay ran third in the 1980 primary.   Both candidates engaged in negative campaigning to such anextent that state Democratic Chairman Charles Whitehead said itcould cost the party the Senate seat being vacated by Chiles after18 years.   ``I certainly think, what with what has gone on in the primary,it's going to make a tougher race for us to win than I would haveliked to have had,'' said Whitehead.   MacKay has made personal integrity an issue, pointing toGunter's taking campaign contributions from the industry heregulates, and saying a 1986 FBI investigation cast a shadow overGunter's performance as commissioner. Gunter says the investigationexonerated him.   In a state with a large Jewish population, Gunter has questionedMacKay's support for Israel. MacKay has angrily depicted this aspart of a whispering campaign unjustly accusing him ofanti-Semitism.   Both campaigns said the race was close.   Dot Joyce of the Florida Division of Elections predicted anoverall turnout of 25 percent as voters choose party candidates torun for a variety of other posts, including insurance commissioner,secretary of state, and federal and state House races.   There are three U.S. House runoffs, all among Republicans.   L.A. ``Skip'' Bafalis and former Lee County Commissioner PorterGoss seek the GOP nomination in the 14th District, where Mack hasgiven up the seat once held by Bafalis to run for the Senate.   The GOP runoff victor faces Democrat Jack Conway, a retiree whowas the first national president of Common Cause, a governmentwatchdog group, and a longtime civil rights activist.   Clifford Stearns, an Ocala hotel and restaurant operator, meetsJim Cherry of Turkey Creek, former head of the state Farmers HomeAdministration, in the 6th District Republican race.   The winner will face Democratic state legislative veteran JonMills of Gainesville in the general election battle to succeedMacKay.   In the 11th District, Republicans will select Bill Tolley ofMelbourne or Rod Borum of Indialantic to face five-term incumbentBill Nelson, who plans to run for the Democratic gubernatorialnomination in 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
