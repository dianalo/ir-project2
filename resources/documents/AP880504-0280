Inspector Kierie du Rand, a police spokesman, said the ranks ofmarchers swelled from an initial 400 schoolchildren to about 3,000as the procession moved through the black township of Katutura,outside the capital of Windhoek.   He said police used rubber bullets when the marchers reached thetownship police station.   The Namibia Communications Center estimated the number ofmarchers at 6,000 and said police used tear gas and truncheons aswell as rubber bullets. The communications center is a news agencythat works with churches opposed to South African rule ofSouth-West Africa, also known as Namibia.   The center said one youth was shot in the leg by the bodyguardof a pro-government tribal chief. Police reported no injuries orarrests.   Wednesday was the 10th anniversary of a South African militarystrike on Cassinga, an Angola town about 150 miles north of theborder with Namibia.   The South-West African People's Organization, which has beenwaging a guerrilla war for independence for 20 years, says 582Namibian refugees camped at Cassinga were killed in the attack by370 South African paratroopers. Among the dead refugees were 120children, the rebel group says.   South African military officials contend that Cassinga was theguerrilla group's main operational base and that the attack wasnecessary to pre-empt guerrilla strikes in Namibia. They say 800guerrillas and six South African soldiers died in the battle.   A military parade celebrating the Cassinga strike was heldWednesday at Oshakati, a major South African army base in northernNamibia.   Lt. Gen. Ian Gleeson, South Africa's army chief of staff, saidthe raid had dealt the guerrilla group a blow from which it hadnever fully recovered, forcing it to concentrate on non-militarytargets.</TEXT></DOC>
