The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 18.98 points to 2276.43, breaking the record it set Wednesday, when it spurted nearly 31 points.    Big gainers included technology, drug and paper issues.    The broader market indexes also broke records established Wednesday, but their gains weren't as strong as the surge in the industrial average. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index was up 1.90 to 290.52, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.00 to 165.41.    Volume on the Big Board rose to 205.4 million shares from 198.4 million Wednesday. There were 898 issues advancing and 716 declining.    General Motors, whose announcement of a huge stock buyback plan helped trigger Wednesday's rally, fell 1 3/8 to 78 1/8 after rising 3 7/8 Wednesday.    &quot;I think things are toned down on GM,&quot; said Jon Groveman, head of equity trading at Ladenburg Thalmann. A decline is normal after such a big gain, analysts said. Also, although GM clearly can afford to fund the big buyback, some analysts reportedly wonder whether the purchase is advisable when the company is a net debtor and struggling to solve major business problems.    Technology stocks were strong, including Cray Research, which was up 3 3/4 to 124; Texas Instruments, up 2 3/4 to 169 1/2; and International Business Machines, up 1/2 to 140 3/8.    Digital Equipment was up 4 1/2 to 170 3/4. Market sources said Marc Schulman, a computer analyst at Salomon Brothers, reiterated his buy recommendation on the stock, which he said could hit 180 soon.    Mr. DaPuzzo said technology stocks were strong because of the belief that the economy will strengthen in the second half, increasing business for such companies.    In addition, Mr. DaPuzzo said, technology stocks &quot;react most quickly in an up market&quot; and tend to post most of their daily gains in one spurt. So institutions expecting big upward moves in the market rush to invest in the sector, creating a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, he said. &quot;If you don't get in quickly, you can miss the pop&quot; in these issues, he said.    Some arbitrage programs tied to stock-index futures helped push stock prices higher but weren't a dominant force in the rally, traders said.    An important boost for the rally came from investors who took advantage of rising stock prices to replace March Sandamp;P 500 stock-index contracts with June contracts, said Mr. Groveman of Ladenburg Thalmann. Such so-called rollover moves, he said, could damp volatility in the stock market at the next quarterly &quot;triple witching hour&quot; March 20, when stock-index futures, options and options on individual stocks all expire.    Market participants said President Reagan's speech Wednesday night responding to the Tower Commission report allayed some of their fears and may have contributed to yesterday's rally. But Mr. Groveman said, &quot;I think the market would have gone up anyway unless Reagan gave a terrible speech.&quot;    Paper stocks surged again, with International Paper up 4 3/4 to 98 1/4, Mead up 4 1/8 to 71, Kimberly-Clark up 7/8 to 110 1/8, James River up 1 to 41 3/8, Champion International up 1 3/8 to 38 5/8, Union Camp up 3 7/8 to 68 1/4 and Weyerhaeuser up 3 to 54 1/4.    Many paper stocks have outpaced the Sandamp;P 500's approximately 20% gain this year. The issues are outperforming the market because the weak dollar gives a big boost to paper makers' overseas sales, analysts said. In addition, analysts said, because of recent cost-cutting in an industry where operating rates are very high, much of the price increases move right into earnings.    Major retailers advanced on their reports of generally stronger-than-expected sales for February. J.C. Penney rose 3 to 98 1/2, F.W. Woolworth inched up 1/4 to 48 1/2, Federated Department Stores increased 7/8 to 96 1/2, K mart advanced 2 1/8 to 60, Carter Hawley Hale inched up 1/4 to 57 1/8. But Sears eased 1/8 to 52 7/8.    Dayton Hudson advanced 1 to 45. The company said February sales rose 19.5% but also said certain expansion costs will cost the company 30 cents a share in 1987.    Heck's plunged 2 5/8 to 4 1/4 after filing for protection under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy law. The company said a bank lending group failed to renew its credit commitment on terms acceptable to Heck's. Several Heck's units aren't included in the Chapter 11 filing.    Bethlehem Steel said it asked its attorneys to study the implications of a Chapter 11 filing, but the nation's No. 3 steelmaker stressed it hasn't any near-term plans to take such action. Nevertheless, the company's stock fell 7/8 to 7 1/2.    General Host plunged 2 1/8 to 11 1/4. Late Wednesday the company said it expects to report a sharp decline in net income or no net income for the year ended Jan. 26.    PepsiCo rose 1 to 34 7/8 with the aid of a buy recommendation by Kidder Peabody analyst Roy Burry. He told Dow Jones News Service that PepsiCo's profit margins for its domestic soft drink business will rise.    MCI Communications called for the immediate deregulation of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph. The move could help stanch regulator-imposed price cuts on ATandamp;T that MCI thought it had to match. MCI's profit has been hurt by such price cuts.    Trans World Airlines, USAir and Piedmont all fell. USAir rejected TWA's $52-a-share takeover offer, and said it had met with Piedmont to discuss its acquistion of Piedmont. TWA fell 7/8 to 31, USAir was down 5/8 to 48 1/2 and Piedmont dropped 1 to 68 5/8.    NWA rose 1 3/4 to 74 1/2 after gaining 2 1/2 Wednesday, when it reported a fourth-quarter profit compared with a year-earlier loss.    Chrysler was up 2 to 52 3/8 after announcing a 3-for-2 stock split in the form of a 50% stock dividend and raising its dividend. Ford rose 1/2 to 79 3/4 and American Motors slipped 1/4 to 3 1/2.    The Nasdaq OTC composite index rose 2.26 to 429.00. In the OTC market there were 1,293 issues advancing and 989 declining. Volume rose to 170.4 million shares from 155.7 million Wednesday. The American Stock Exchange Market Value index rose 3.17 to 329.47. Both the Nasdaq and Amex indexes surpassed records set Wednesday.    Among drug issues, Merck rose 2 1/8 to 160 5/8, Carter-Wallace advanced 4 to 126 1/4, Pfizer was up 3/4 to 73 1/4, Upjohn increased 2 1/2 to 149 3/4 and Squibb rose 3/4 to 165 1/2. </TEXT></DOC>
