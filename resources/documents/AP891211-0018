But after the summit's first day, the Nicaraguans were no closerto getting agreement on their proposal.   ``Nothing has been done,'' Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto ofNicaragua told reporters after the day's session had ended.   ``The demobilization of the Contras must be complied with,'' hesaid. ``The United Nations must begin to function in Nicaragua.''   Also Sunday, the Salvadoran government rejected a truce proposedby leftist rebels fighting in that country.   In return for demobilization of the Contras, the Nicaraguangovernment would consider resuming its cease-fire and ``technicaltalks'' with the leadership of the Honduras-based rebels, said aNicaraguan source after the opening of the two-day summit.   The source close to the Nicaraguan delegation, who refused to beidentified, also said Nicaragua was willing to allow the U.N. groupto verify that no weapons are sent from Nicaragua to El Salvador'sleftist rebels.   The U.N. observers were approved four months ago to monitor thevoluntary repatriation of the Contras and make sure that onecountry's territory was not being used to launch attacks on aneighbor.   The source, however, said the Nicaraguan government was notoptimistic about acceptance of the proposal in view of the UnitedStates' ``bipartisan decision to keep the Contras alive until afterthe February elections in Nicaragua.''   Nicaragua canceled its cease-fire with the Contras on Nov. 1,accusing them of disrupting registration for the Feb. 25 elections.   Also at Sunday's opening session, the Salvadoran governmentrejected a cease-fire proposal by the leftist rebels of theFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN.   The rebels asked for the dismissal of seven high-rankingmilitary leaders in El Salvador and ``full respect for human rightsand democratic liberties of political and social organizations.''   The Salvadoran government instead asked the rebels to make acommitment not to launch attacks in urban areas and offered toresume negotiations in Venezuela.   Costa Rica proposed a truce in El Salvador from Dec. 12 throughJan. 15 ``to give the FMLN and the government time to beginnegotiations for a permanent cease-fire.'' Costa Rica also proposedthat the United Nations be given powers to verify such a cease-firein El Salvador.   The five Central American presidents opened their meeting in anatmosphere of frustration and pessimism, hoping the superpowerswould help rescue the flagging peace efforts in the region.   ``We must face that reality'' that the superpowers' help isneeded, said Costa Rican Foreign Minister Rodrigo Madrigal, whocommented on the presidents' discussions. He added that regionalagreements will not have much validity in those places whereparties in the conflicts have close ties to the United States andthe Soviet Union.   Attending the summit are presidents Oscar Arias of Costa Rica,Alfredo Cristiani of El Salvador, Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala, JoseAzcona Hoyo of Honduras and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua.   The presidents met briefly in a conference room, listened to awelcoming speech by Costa Rican Information Minister Jorge Urbina,and then went into a private session.   Arias on Saturday had called the superpowers, without naming theUnited States and Soviet Union, ``two-faced.'' He said they spokeabout political solutions while encouraging military activities.   ``We must demand from them a definition of their roles, whatthey have done themselves or through other countries to exert anegative or positive influence in the region,'' Madrigal said.   He did not suggest how the superpowers might respond, but onesource, speaking with the condition of anonymity, said the twomight send representatives or observers to negotiations between thewarring parties.   The United States supports the Nicaraguan rebels fighting theleftist Sandinista government. It also backs El Salvador in itscivil war against leftist insurgents. Washington accuses the SovietUnion and Cuba of providing arms and aid to Nicaragua and theSalvadoran rebels.   This summit had been scheduled to be held in Nicaragua, but itwas changed to San Jose when El Salvador suspended relations withNicaragua last month.   El Salvador took the action after two small planes were found inEl Salvador carrying surface-to-air rockets that Cristiani saidwere being flown from Nicaragua to the FMLN. One plane crashed andthe other was burned at a rural airstrip.   Agreements reached at an August summit in Tela, Honduras, calledfor the Nicaraguan Contra rebels to disband by Dec. 5. However,their forces, headquartered in camps in Honduras, have remained inplace.</TEXT></DOC>
