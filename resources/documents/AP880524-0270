When the Moscow summit _ the fourth between Reagan and SovietCommunist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev _ was set latelast year, both sides were optimistic they could sign a treatyreducing long-range nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent.   But the negotiations are far from complete, snagged onverification and the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative, among otherthings.   Among the other issues to be discussed during the Moscow summit:</TEXT><HEAD>NUCLEAR TESTING</HEAD><TEXT>   Reagan and Gorbachev are expected to sign two protocols inMoscow dealing with underground nuclear explosions. Both aredesigned to improve monitoring procedures.   A U.S.-Soviet treaty signed in 1974 limits underground blasts,the only nuclear explosions still legal, to 150 kilotons. At thesummit, the two leaders are likely to set the ground rules forjoint experiments in Nevada and in Semipalatinsk in July and Augustto measure the force of detonations.   The Americans prefer a system known as Cortex, which involvesinserting a cable in a shaft about 30 feet from the test and takingmeasurements from it, while the Soviets like the seismic systemused for earthquakes.   Both systems will be used at the U.S. and Soviet tests.   A 1976 treaty set the same 150-kiloton ceiling for so-calledpeaceful blasts. These are nuclear explosions to change the coursesof rivers, or for other non-military purposes. The United Stateswants to be able to monitor blasts above the 50-kiloton level.   Neither side now engages in such testing.   Still, Reagan has said if verification measures to guard againstcheating are improved he would submit the unratified treaties tothe Senate for approval.</TEXT><HEAD>CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS</HEAD><TEXT>   Top U.S. officials say the summit will give both sides anopportunity to ``review where we are'' regarding conventionalweapons in Europe, but a bilateral accord is unlikely because ofon-going negotiations in Vienna between the countries of the WarsawPact and NATO alliance. There have been hints that Gorbachev mightunilaterally withdraw 50,000 to 100,000 troops from Eastern Europeto gain a public relations advantage in the negotiations.   Moscow has conceded for the first time that it has an advantageover the West in some military categories. The Pentagon estimatesthe Soviets have 230 divisions in Eastern Europe compared to 121for NATO.</TEXT><HEAD>CHEMICAL WEAPONS</HEAD><TEXT>   Like conventional arms, the issue of chemical weapons is thesubject of multilateral treaty negotiations under way in Geneva.Hence, the United States is reluctant to sign anything, althoughthe issue will be raised.   The Soviets have been pressing the United States to endorse asweeping ban on lethal chemical weapons, but U.S. officials saythat push is politically motivated. What the United States wants isa ``truly global chemical weapons agreement'' that can be verified,Assistant Secretary of State Rozanne Ridgway said.   The Soviets have agreed to join the verification process, butthey haven't filed the necessary plans to safeguard againstcheating. U.S. officials estimate the Soviets have 300,000 tons ofchemical weapons, about six times the U.S. amount.</TEXT><HEAD>REGIONAL CONFLICTS</HEAD><TEXT>   The future of Afghanistan will be raised even though the Sovietshave agreed to withdraw from the country under a U.N. agreementsigned this spring. Specifically at issue is the fate of 5 millionrefugees living in Pakistan and Iran.   The top regional issue, however, is Angola where U.S. and Sovietofficials have been trying to arrange a withdrawal of 40,000 Cubantroops from the country. Withdrawal would have to be accompanied byimplementation of U.S. resolution 435, calling for an end to theSouth African occupation of Namibia.   Otherwise, the United States wants the Soviets to stop sellingweapons to Iran in the Gulf War and to pressure Vietnam to removeits troops from Cambodia.   On the Mideast, the Soviets want a full-blown internationalpeace conference to reach a settlement, while the United Statesfavors a mostly ceremonial conference that would lead to bilateraltalks between Israel and its Arab neighbors.</TEXT><HEAD>CULTURE, EDUCATION</HEAD><TEXT>   The two sides hope to arrive at a three-year agreement oneducational and cultural exchanges, extending the accord signed atGeneva in November 1985. The exchanges, monitored by the U.S.Information Agency, have mushroomed as Americans and Soviets seekto learn more about each other through visits and study. But theexchanges are still lopsided with many more Americans visiting theSoviet Union than vice versa. Under the agreements, high school andcollege students have traveled abroad, and entertainers from bothcountries have toured.</TEXT><HEAD>HUMAN RIGHTS</HEAD><TEXT>   Reagan can be expected to broach the human rights issue,particularly the plight of thousands of Soviet Jews who have beenprohibited from emigrating. Meantime, both sides are moving towardan agreement that would allow American psychiatrists to visitSoviet mental hospitals to determine if dissidents are beingimprisoned in the hospitals. The Soviets would carry out reciprocalvisits to U.S. mental hospitals.</TEXT><HEAD>SCIENCE</HEAD><TEXT>   Negotiators have drawn up _ but may not sign _ a draft agreementthat calls for annual U.S.-Soviet meetings to promote freerscientific data exchanges. It includes regulations to protectscientific ideas, and gives the United States possible access toSoviet research fields such as nuclear fusion, mathematical theoryand metallurgy.</TEXT><HEAD>SPACE</HEAD><TEXT>   The United States has agreed to help a Soviet unmanned probe ofthe planet Mars in 1994, but the two sides are far from signing anagreement for a joint mission. The Reagan team, however, isprepared to propose the exchange of studies of future spaceprojects.</TEXT><HEAD>FISHERIES</HEAD><TEXT>   The Americans are excited about the possibility of a fisheriesagreement at the summit. At its heart would be the U.S. right tofish in the Soviet economic zone, 200 miles from shore. Ofparticular interest to the United States is the Bering Sea. Sovietvessels already have access to the U.S. 200-mile zone. Thecomprehensive agreement would also cover conservation andenvironmental protections.</TEXT><HEAD>COAST GUARD</HEAD><TEXT>   The Coast Guard and the Soviet maritime are exploringcooperation on search and rescue operations and exchangingtransporation technologies.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 29</NOTE></DOC>
