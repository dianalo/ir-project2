Dale Bumpers says he can't fathom why thefederal government would sell mineral-rich lands at terms enactedby Ulysses S. Grant.   So the Arkansas Democrat is sponsoring legislation that wouldlevy an 8 percent royalty and raise the fees charged on landsobtained from the federal government for mining ``hardrock''minerals such as gold, silver, copper or iron.   The 118-year-old law, signed into law when Grant was president,allows miners outright ownership of land for a fee of $2.50 to $5an acre - the approximate price of land in 1872 - if they provethey've found a valuable deposit and performed $500 worth of workthere.   ``I don't understand why this particular industry ... ought tojust have a bird nest on the ground,'' Bumpers said Thursday at ahearing of a Senate Energy and Commerce subcommittee. ``There isn'ta state in the nation that would permit this.''   The government already gets royalties from oil, gas and coalleases, he noted.   The Bush administration, however, joined representatives ofmining companies in opposing Bumpers' proposal.   Royalties could make it economically unfeasible to riskdeveloping mineral deposits on public lands, said Cy Jamison,director of the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management.   Stephen Alfers, a Denver attorney who analyzed Bumpers'legislation at the Senate committee's request, said the proposal``would have a devastating impact on the U.S. mining industry.''   Smaller miners will ``have no future, many mines will close,construction of new mines will decline precipitously, explorationand discovery of new deposits will decline, and mining activitywill concentrate on private lands and in foreign countries,''Alfers said.   An 8 percent royalty on gross proceeds would consume nearly halfthe typical mining company's profit, said Alfers, who representslandowners and mining companies who develop minerals on public andprivate lands.   The proposed royalty would raise $300 million a year for federaland state governments, Bumpers said. The Bureau of Land Managementestimates that $3.9 billion in minerals are mined from public landseach year, he said.   Since 1970, the federal government has sold land worth up to $47million for just $4,500, according to a recent General AccountingOffice study.</TEXT></DOC>
