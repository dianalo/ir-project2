A spokesman for the trucking and truck-leasing company said the O'Neill family, descendants of the three O'Neill brothers who founded Leaseway, had initiated the sale of the stock, which the spokesman said represents the family's entire taxable holdings. Prior to the sale, the O'Neill family held about 30% of Leaseway's 11.8 million shares outstanding. The family's remaining 1.3 million shares, or an indicated 13.5% of the company's 9.6 million shares currently outstanding, are held in various trusts, the spokesman indicated. The company said that the 2.2 million shares will be held in treasury.    The $48.125-a-share price is below the $51-a-share price being offered by an investor group that plans to take Leaseway private through a leveraged buyout. As previously reported, the group led by Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd. and including several members of Leaseway management proposed the $602 million buyout in mid-November. The buyout is now valued at about $490 million, reflecting fewer shares outstanding, a company spokesman said.    According to the Leaseway spokesman, the O'Neill family found it more advantageous for tax purposes to sell their taxable holdings in 1986 even at the lower price than wait until next year. Under the new federal tax law, the more favorable treatment of capital gains will be eliminated starting in 1987.    The $48.125 price was the closing price for Leaseway on the New York Stock Exchange Dec. 16, the company said. Leaseway said it purchased the shares &quot;over the last few days.&quot;    Leaseway stock closed on the Big Board yesterday at $47.75, down 12.5 cents.    Completion of the buyout is subject to various customary conditions, including that the investor group obtain necessary financing. Leaseway said the group has obtained &quot;satisfactory&quot; financing commitments. In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
