STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DRESDEN, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Lutheran Church in East Germanyis under increasing pressure from the nation's communist governmentto curb its support of human rights efforts and to disavow would-beemigres.   ``The government at the moment appears to view all our effortstoward dialogue as destructive,'' Bishop Werner Leich, who heads thenation's Lutheran Church Conference, told The Associated Press in arecent interview.   At a series of conferences last year, church leaders have calledfor dialogue with government officials on a variety of topics,including human rights issues, implementation of Soviet-stylepolitical reforms, education policies and alternative militaryservice.   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, oropenness, has been a frequent theme, and church leaders havecriticized the nation's conservative leadership for rejectingoutright the need for such a reform course.   Church calls for change, including a loosening of the nation'stough foreign travel and emigration policies, have been rebuffed bythe government, which has seized or censored several churchpublications in recent months.   Human rights activists loosely allied with the church have beendetained and questioned. Would-be emigres _ some of whom turned tothe church for help</TEXT><TEXT>   have been imprisoned. Others have lost theirjobs.   Scores have been warned not to participate in silent vigilsstaged in front of churches to protest government decisions denyingthem exit visas.   A church-sponsored international youth congress was also bannedin November. State-run news media said the conference's proposedthemes _ peace issues and discussions about reforms in the SovietUnion _ could have ``threatened church-state relations.''   The Communist Party's chief ideologues have charged that thechurch has overstepped its bounds and have cautioned it to stick toreligious issues and stay out of politics.   About 80 percent of the population is Lutheran.   ``The East German Communist Party has traditionally beenorthodox, intolerant and inflexible,'' says a Western diplomaticsource. ``In regard to its (present) behavior toward the LutheranChurch, it's certainlyliving up to that tradition.''   Bishop Leich said the government's reaction to the church'sefforts to discuss social and political problems has been needlesslyharsh and that its refusal to discuss problems has led to a certainresignation among East Germans.   ``I have the impression that in many instances the politicalleadership is no longer in touch with reality,'' Leich said.   Leich ran afoul of the communist leadership when he declaredrecently that socialism in East Germany should show a more humanface, in a reference to a term used to describe short-lived reformsin Czechoslovakia in 1968.   The church has traditionally sought to work together with thestate in resolving problems from within, its willingness tocompromise summed up in agreements with the state that defined therole of the ``church in socialism.''   That view guided largely conformative church policy during thedifficult decades of reconstruction after World War II.   But Leich said times have changed.   ``Discussion has now become more important than simply followingorders,'' Leich said.   ``We have always believed that our church has the task andresponsibility of helping to determine and to shape our society andour nation. To do that, one must speak openly and critically.''   But over the past year, the church has found itself increasinglyat odds with the government over the issue of ``ausreisewillige,'' _or those who want to leave the country.   Growing dissatisfaction over economic and political conditionshas led to a record number of applications from East Germans whowant to leave the country for neighboring capitalist West Germany.   According to estimates by the West German government and humanrights groups, more than 750,000 people have filed applications toleave East Germany.   Counting family members, the total amounts to 1.5 million of thenation's 16 million population.   In keeping with its position to change the system from within,church leaders have been careful not to encourage East Germans toleave the country, arguing instead for patience and renewedcommitment to the community.   ``We try to give people strength, but it's hard, very hard,''said a Lutheran pastor, whose congregation in a small town outsideDresden has dwindled over the years as more an more families haveleft for the West.   ``You can't hold a community together with people who alreadyhave one foot in the federal republic (West Germany),'' said thepastor, who asked that his name not be used.   At a church conference earlier this year, participants urged thegovernment to loosen its travel and emigration restrictions, saying``we'll want to stay, once we're allowed to leave.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs Jan. 6.</NOTE></DOC>
