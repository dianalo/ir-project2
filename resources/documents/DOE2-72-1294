The correspondingcurrent is a one-particle analog of the Pauli-Lubanski vector. An anomalyin the divergence of the current in an external gravitational field isfound. The result is used to determine the electromagnetic radiativecorrection to the chiral anomaly of a fermion in a gravitational field.</TEXT></DOC>
