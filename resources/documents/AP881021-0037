A weary House Speaker Jim Wright predicted Thursday night thatboth houses would approve the leaders' ``final agreement'' on thedrug bill today, but cautioned that the obscenity language couldnot be ``nailed down'' until lawmakers reviewed it. The bill is themajor legislation keeping Congress in session.   After marathon meetings by rank-and-file negotiators, Wright _along with the majority and minority leaders of both houses _gathered to tackle the unresolved issues Thursday night.   The thorniest among them proved to be Senate-passed language togive the federal government broad new powers to combat obscenity.   Earlier in the day, rank-and-file lawmakers stripped thelanguage from the drug bill after liberals insisted thegovernment's powers would be too broad.   ``We were threatened with a revolt'' by conservatives, saidWright, who admitted he began envisioning an embarrassing floorfight that would destroy his effort to unite liberals andconservatives, Democrats and Republicans, behind the bill thatcould help all incumbents.   A coalition of conservative groups began an intense last-ditchtelephone campaign to win inclusion of the anti-obscenityprovisions, said Diane Quartermain, legislative affairs director ofthe Liberty Federation, formerly the Moral Majority.   The bill _ which would authorize some $2.5 billion in newanti-drug money, is an ambitious attempt to deal with all aspectsof the drug problem, including law enforcement, treatment,rehabilitation, education and help for authorities indrug-producing countries.   New initiatives would include up to $10,000 in civil fines forthose caught with personal use amounts of drugs; a federal deathpenalty for killers in drug-related crimes; and denial of somefederal benefits to convicted drug offenders, including users.   A number of lawmakers cautioned the drug bill would bemeaningless without new financing, and the House AppropriationsCommittee took quick action Thursday.   The panel approved $500 million in new spending for the drugbill, an amount that would pay for barely a third of the estimated$1.4 billion first-year costs of the legislation. The final cost isexpected to be about $2.5 billion if the multi-year measure isfully financed.   The $500 million includes: $242 million for treatment,prevention and education; $179 million for new agents and equipmentfor federal law enforcement agencies; $42 million for the federalcourts; $25 million for the Coast Guard; and the rest for programsof the departments of state and agriculture, and the Food and DrugAdministration.   A combined bill to combat adult obscenity and child pornographyhad passed the Senate 97-0 previously, and was added to the drugbill when the House refused to take action. The child pornographylanguage was approved by the drug bill negotiators.   The obscenity language passed by the Senate would allow thefederal government to seize property used to commit or promote anobscenity offense; and authorize the government to seek civil finesagainst those producing, transporting or receiving obscenematerials.   But Wright said the leadership agreed to target only majordealers or producers of obscene materials who were ``knowinglyengaged for a long period of time.'' He said the language was notaimed at the bookstore owner who may have a single volume judged tobe obscene.   He called the language ``constitutionally respectable andacceptable.''   Lawmakers opted to accept portions of House and Senate languageon a program to deny federal benefits to convicted drug offenders,including those convicted of possession.   Benefits such as federal public housing, grants, contracts,loans, mortgage guarantees, and some forms of veterans' aid couldbe lost to drug offenders. Judges would have discretion, however,on whether to impose the penalty after conviction.   The president would submit a report on the program to Congressnext May, allowing lawmakers to reconsider the proposal. No onecould be denied benefits before next September. Social Security,Medicare, welfare benefits and some other veterans' aid programswould be exempted even after September.   Negotiators agreed that if someone is killed during a federaldrug felony, the federal death penalty could apply if: the killerwas engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise; was trafficking inmajor amounts of cocaine, heroin or other drugs; intentionally gavean order that resulted in a killing; or killed a police officer.   In other key decisions, negotiators:   _Agreed to create a ``drug czar'' in the president's Cabinet, tocoordinate national drug policy. The official would develop plansfor every phase of the drug war, share with relevant Cabinet headsthe authority to transfer personnel, and have the right to objectwhen he believes drug funding is inadequate or misdirected.   _Dropped a House provision that would have permittedintroduction in federal court of evidence seized illegally, but in``good faith,'' even in warrantless searches.   _Accepted Senate language on child pornography, including a20-year-to-life prison term for anyone convicted of facilitatinguse of a child for producing sexually explicit materials.   _Gave the Justice Department nine months to develop a system forgun dealers to check whether purchasers are convicted felons.   _Agreed that records of those punished by civil fines would beexpunged automatically after a period of time.   _Resolved that states initially would have to contribute 25percent of the cost of federal grants for anti-drug crime programs.After the first year of the four-year program, the state portionwould go to 50 percent.   _Agreed to restore to U.S. attorneys the ability to prosecutecorrupt public officials under the theory that they deprivedAmericans of honest government services. A Supreme Court ruling inJune 1987 had prevented such prosecutions.   _Agreed to finance drug education programs for privateemployees, low-income pregnant women, gang members, students, anddropouts.   _Decided to drop proposals for random drug testing oftransportation workers.</TEXT></DOC>
