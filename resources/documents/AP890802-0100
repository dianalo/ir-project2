KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate, struggling toward passage of a$295 billion defense authorization bill, voted today to pay for thewar on drugs with an infusion of unspent dollars from governmentagencies _ including the Pentagon.   The 90-9 vote, taken as the Senate worked into the early morninghours, would authorize the transfer of $1.7 billion from all but ashort list of exempted federal programs to pay the full cost ofkeeping the government's promise to fight ``the epidemic ofnarcotics sweeping this country.''   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the SenateAppropriations Committee, said the action, if approved by the Houseand enacted into law, puts the problem of paying for the drug warsquarely on President Bush's shoulders.   ``This amendment authorizes the president to fund the drugpackage,'' Byrd said. ``It says: `Mr. President, when it passesinto law, it's your baby. You fund the war on drugs. If you don'tlike it, find another way.'''   In other action before adjourning at 2:50 a.m. EDT, the Senate:   _Voted to give air police last-resort permission to shoot downaircraft flying narcotics into the United States.   _Adopted a series of ``burden-sharing'' amendments aimed atincreasing the contributions to defense by U.S. allies in Europeand Asia.   _Bolstered Bush's bid to make the MX missile a moving ratherthan a stationary target by shelving, 62-38, an amendment slicing$502 million from the funds available to place the force of 50missiles on railway cars.   _Turned aside an attempt to bring to an immediate vote anamendment restoring the military pension lost when former MarineLt. Col. Oliver L. North was convicted on three felony counts inthe Iran-Contra affair. As a compromise, it ordered the SenateJudiciary Committee to hold hearings and report on the contentiousissue by Nov. 1.   When the Senate resumed consideration of the defense bill thismorning, lawmakers voted 53-44 to turn aside an amendment thatwould earmark $100 million for the effective deployment of 100ground-based interceptors in Grand Forks, N.D., by 1995.   The interceptors, part of the Accidental Launch ProtectionSystem, would be used against sudden terrorist missile attacks.   The Senate also voted 84-13 to limit the number of amendments onthe defense bill to those that are germane to the subject, thusshortening debate.   Lawmakers took that step after an amendment regarding tests ofanti-satellite systems was deemed not germane to the defense billbecause of technical reasons.   After a rancorous debate earlier, the Senate declined to supportan amendment to siphon $450 million from the authorization for theStar Wars strategic defense initiative for the war on drugs.   Instead, it approved the compromise drafted by Sen. Sam Nunn,D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Forces Committee as adesperation move to guarantee the drug war will be fully funded.   Nunn said his amendment would keep the promises of the drug billpassed last year by shifting unspent balances in federal programsleft over at the end of the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.   The measure exempts entitlement programs, including SocialSecurity, Medicare, and subsidized housing. But all othergovernment programs and agencies would be compelled to contribute.   ``This is not the best way to fund the drug bill and I hopeanother way will be found,'' Nunn said. ``But this will do the job.   ``This says, before you spend money on other things you've gotto fund the drug bill.''   Several senators complained that such popular programs asstudent aid and education for the handicapped would be ``sharplyand severely'' cut by the amendment.   But Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del. told the Senate: ``I'm arealist. I know there is no way to get the money out of Star Wars.... I have no hesitation of choosing money for the war on drugsover student aid, over any other thing in the entire budget.''   Biden, rhetorically addressing Bush, complained theadministration had not kept promises to fully fund the drug war.   ``You've given us cardboard cops, you've given us cardboardprisons, you've given us nothing, Mr. President,'' Biden said,adding that while Bush has vowed not to increase taxes, theAmerican people want the drug war paid for, no matter the cost.   Voting against the amendment were Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.,Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., Bennett Johnston,D-La., Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., JohnKerry, D-Mass., Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J., and James McClure,R-Idaho. Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., did not vote because he had toleave for a family emergency.   In a flurry of early morning action, the Senate by voice voteadopted a series of amendments intended to press U.S. allies intoaccepting a greater share of the defense burden.   One issues a warning to NATO that the United States may reduceU.S. troop strength in Europe if the alliance unilaterally cuts itsstrength in the absence of negotiated troop reductions by theSoviet Union.   Another calls on Japan to boost defense and foreign-aid spendingand requires the president to negotiate an agreement providing forJapan to completely offset the costs of maintaining U.S. forces todefend Japanese territory.   A third directs the president to prepare a five-year plan forthe U.S. military presence in South Korea, including a discussion``of the feasibility and desirability of partial, gradualreductions in U.S. military personnel stationed there.''</TEXT></DOC>
