The suspecthoses were manufactured using a material that has subsequently been foundto be understrength in that it degrades prematurely under certain heatconditions. This hose material was manufactured by Aeroquip Corporationand the suspect hoses are installed in 601-type hose assemblies. The suspectfuel supply hoses bear cure date codes of 3Q84 through 2Q87; the suspectvapor recovery hoses bear cure date codes of 2Q84 through 3Q87. The suspectbulk 601 hose has a CAGE code of 50556 (regardless of cure date code).Failure of the main fuel supply or vapor recovery hose could result ina fire in the airplane engine compartments.The FAA has reviewed and approved the following service bulletins, whichdescribe procedures for inspection of the main fuel supply and vapor recoveryhoses on the various affected airplanes, and replacement of the hoses,if necessary:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s100,r70,r70,r70</C> <H1>Airplane</H1><H1>Manufacturer</H1><H1>Service Bulletin</H1><H1>Date</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">B-747 series with CF6-45/50 engines<D>Boeing</D><D>747-73A2048</D><D>June 9, 1988.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">B-747 series with RB211-524 engines<D>Boeing</D><D>747-73A2049</D><D>December 8, 1988.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">DC-9 series, DC-9-80 series, Model MD-88<D>McDonnell Douglas</D><D>A73-10, Rev. 1</D><D>June 22, 1988.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">DC-10 series<D>McDonnell Douglas</D><D>A73-21</D><D>June 23, 1988.</D></ITAG></ITAG>  Additionally, Airbus Industrie has issued the following service bulletinswhich describe similar procedures:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s100,r70,r70,r70</C> <H1>Airplane</H1><H1>Manufacturer</H1><H1>Service Bulletin</H1><H1>Date</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">A300<D>Airbus Industrie</D><D>A300-73-009</D><D>September 30, 1988.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A300-600<D>Airbus Industrie</D><D>A300-73-6008</D><D>October 11, 1988.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A310<D>Airbus Industrie</D><D>A310-73-2011 Rev. 1</D><D>September 27, 1988.</D></ITAG></ITAG>Airbus Industrie Model A300, A300-600, and A310 series airplanes are manufacturedin France and type certificated in the United States under the provisionsof section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicablebilateral airworthiness agreement.Since this situation is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type designs, this AD requires inspection of the main fuel supplyand vapor recovery hoses and, if fuel leakage is detected, replacementof the hoses prior to futher flight, in accordance with the applicableservice bulletin previously described. If fuel leakage is not detected,the suspect hoses must be repetitively inspected until replaced with serviceablehoses. Such replacement constitutes terminating action for the repetitiveinspections. This section also prohibits the installation of bulk 601 hosewith CAGE code of 50556.The Direction GeandCx.174;1neandCx.174;1rale de L'Aviation Civile (DGAC), whichis the airworthiness authority of France, has issued a similar airworthinessdirective addressing this subject.Since a situation exists that requires immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable,and good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than30 days. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationand is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291. It is impracticablefor the agency to follow the procedures of Order 12291 with respect tothis rule since the rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafecondition in aircraft. It has been further determined that this documentinvolves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If this action is subsequently determinedto involve a significant/major regulation, a final regulatory evaluationor analysis, as appropriate, will be prepared and placed in the regulatorydocket (otherwise, an evaluation is not required).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection; 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
