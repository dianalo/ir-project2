Baker III said Wednesday.   Baker said at the White House ``we deeply regret'' theexecutions, which were carried out in Shanghai over pleas forclemency by the United States and other Western nations.   Vice President Dan Quayle said, ``We're very disappointed withthe government of China.'' He repeated U.S. calls for restraint.   One day after adopting new sanctions and asking China to sparethe lives of demonstrators sentenced to death, the United Statesmuted its reaction to the executions. State Department spokesmanRichard Boucher said there was no plan to register a protest or tocall in a Chinese diplomat.   President Bush brushed aside reporters' questions about thematter.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said sanctions and pleasfor leniency have not swayed Chinese leaders.   ``It's hard to suggest that there has been very much impact''Fitzwater said.   ``The weight of world opinion has been heavy on the shoulders ofChina and it does not appear to have made much difference.'' He said``history has shown that they generally are not that responsive tooutside kinds of pleas.''   Fitzwater joined Baker in emphasizing that the United States mustcontinue to do business with China despite international outrageover the country's bloody crackdown and suppression of pro-democracyforces.   ``This is a country of a billion people and is a sizable portionof the world population that cannot be closeted off and ignored,''Fitzwater said.   On Capitol Hill, however, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,D-Maine, said that in view of the executions and other ``barbaric''acts, ``the president must and should consider taking further steps,particularly with respect to trade.''   ``There are times when what American stands for and believes inis more important than an economic benefit to be derived from atrade relationship,'' Mitchell said.   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Appropriationsforeign operations subcommittee, said he told Chinese Ambassador HanXu that economic sanctions are certain to be imposed if executionscontinue.   ``Much that has been built up in the last 10 years could bedestroyed,'' Leahy said.   He said Han replied that actions by his government are ``internalmatters'' and that he hoped the administration ``would be careful innot taking steps that would sever a relationship carefully nurturedover a decade.''   After prodding from Congress, the White House announced Tuesdayit was ending all high-level official contacts with Beijing andattempting to postpone new loans from international banks, a stepthat could affect at least $1.4 billion for Beijing.   The World Bank, chief source of aid to Third World countries,said it already had suspended new loans to China, as of June 8, justdays after Chinese troops killed hundreds _ perhaps thousands _ ofdemonstrators in Beijing.   Shanghai authorities executed three men who were convicted ofsetting fire to a train after it crashed through a barricade erectedby pro-democracy demonstrators and killed six people.   Baker said, ``The United States is not contemplating anyadditional action at this time'' against Beijing.   ``There is an important relationship here which we should seek topreserve if we possibly can,'' Baker said. ``That is a considerationthat must be taken on board.''   Baker commented to reporters outside the White House as heescorted visiting West German Foreign Minister HansDietrich-Genscher to a luncheon.   Genscher had been asked his reaction during a picture-takingsession with Bush and began to reply that ``we are condemning thebrutal. ...'' His comment was cut off by a White House aide whoshouted an order for the photo session to end.   Later, Genscher told a news conference that he and Bush``discussed with great concern the developments in the People'sRepublic of China. I said that we condemn the brutality that isexpressed in the death sentences and their execution.''   Fitzwater, discussing the U.S. approach to China's crackdown,said, ``It's important that we have some perspective in viewing theoverall, long-term relationship with China and that we believe wehave tried to strike the right balance.   ``We feel we're walking a line there in a sense but we thinkthere's been no question about how the U.S. feels,'' he said. ``Noone around the world can have any doubt about the U.S. outrage atthis entire process.''</TEXT></DOC>
