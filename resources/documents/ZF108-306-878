 The performance of applicationsoftware and peripherals can be only as good as the NeXT hardware, operatingsystem and user interface allow.andM;We looked at the NeXT environment as a publishing workstation, but many ofthe comments could apply to any application.andM;Getting started.andP;  The NeXT Computer System is basically plug and play, likethe Macintosh.andP;  Loading software or hooking up peripheral devices isgenerally straightforward.andP;  We had occasion to go into the Unix terminal totroubleshoot a problem setting up the GatorBox and mounting a floppy drive tothe system, which exposed the less friendly side of the system.andP;  You'll needa Unix aficionado around for those unseemly situations.andM;The NeXT OS and software.andP;  The NeXT environment brings some real strengths topublishing, including the on-line Webster's dictionary and thesaurus, superbbuilt-in networking and electronic mail, and the capability to archivedocuments for search and retrieval with Digital Librarian.andM;NeXT's variant of the Unix operating system provides a broader range ofbuilt-in capabilities than the Mac operating system, including interprocesscommunication, which allows live links between applications, and multitaskingwith memory protection.andP;  However, that built-in functionality takes a lot ofhorsepower.andP;  We recommend 16 Mbytes for publishing applications, but eventhat and NeXT's dedicated I/O processors can't fully harness the prodigiouscapabilities of the operating system.andM;Display PostScript.andP;  NeXT's windowing system uses Adobe Systems Inc.'sproprietary Display PostScript, which provides the NeXT computer with aunified imaging model: PostScript on the MegaPixel Display and PostScript inthe printers.andP;  This creates a high degree of fidelity between the screen andprinted output, ensuring that the fonts and images on screen are what theprinter will produce.andM;User interface.andP;  The look and feel of the NeXT interface adds a dimensionthat impresses even the most loyal Macintosh user.andP;  The windows and objectsthat make up the interface are rendered in gray shades, creating a 3-D effectthat we found very seductive.andM;Like the Mac interface, the NeXT user interface employs pointing and clickingas its underlying foundation.andP;  Users will find their Mac skills highlytransferable.andP;  The cube has its Finder, in the form of the Workspace Manager,which has icons, tear-off menus, dialog boxes (called panels) and a filedirectory.andP;  And, like the Mac, the interface encourages consistency acrossapplications, so the learning curve for new programs is shorter.andM;Display.andP;  NeXT offers only one display device, the 17-inch (diagonal),flat-screen MegaPixel Display.andP;  The screen has a gray-level interface butsupports only black and white and two shades of gray.andP;  Nonetheless, the highresolution -- about 94 dpi, compared with 72 on the Mac -- and gray levelsproduce a smooth, crisp viewing environment.andP;  Positioning graphics is easierand more precise than on a typical large-screen display for the Mac.andP;  Thetilt-and-roll mechanism for the display makes it easy to adjust the viewingangle.andM;For publishing, the display has one drawback: The size does not permit facingpages to be viewed at 100 percent.andM;Keyboard and mouse.andP;  The feel of the NeXT keyboard is similar to that of thestandard Mac keyboard.andP;  It has 85 keys, including the power switch, cursorkeys and a numeric key pad.andP;  Some users may miss the presence ofuser-definable function keys.andM;The NeXT system is mouse-intensive, but Mac users shouldn't have a problemadapting to NeXT's two-button, opto-mechanical mouse.andM;Mass storage.andP;  We recommend that you run your applications from a hard disk.andO;The optical disc is too noisy and slow to be used for anything but backup andsoftware distribution.andP;  The internal 330-Mbyte hard disk, with an averageseek time of 14.8 milliseconds, is adequate.andP;  NeXT also offers a 660-Mbytehard disk but has not solicited third-party storage options.andM;Performance.andP;  One of the main issues for publishing or any other applicationon the NeXT computer is speed.andP;  Multitasking Unix and the beautiful interfacecome at a price that users accustomed to personal computers may finddifficult to accept.andM;Unlike the Mac operating system, which allows multiple applications to beopen simultaneously and has limited background processing capabilities,NeXT's true multitasking allows various tasks to operate concurrently;however, as with any multitasking system, the performance of individualapplications suffer.andP;  In some circumstances we found that multitasking andinterprocess communication cannot be used effectively because the NeXTmachine is too sluggish.andM;You can edit a FrameMaker document while you are searching Digital Librarianwithout noticeable delays, for example, but frequently we found ourselvestemporarily locked out of the computer while loading in data from disk, suchas when launching an application and when printing complex multipagedocuments.andP;  Resizing and zooming in on images in TopDraw and otherapplications was also slow in many instances.andM;Additionally, when the system is overloaded, response to menu commands can beslow, and the NeXT interface, although intuitive, doesn't always offer theuser much in the way of feedback to indicate that the system is busy.andM;Complex graphics files don't work very predictably yet, and there areconversion problems with both TIFF and Encapsulated PostScript files thataren't fatal but are a nuisance.andP;  We also experienced system crashes whilerunning applications.andM;In the case of formidable programs such as FrameMaker, we recommend that yourun only one application at a time, especially if you are running in amulti-user working environment.andM;Printing.andP;  The NeXT laser printer, which can be shared on a network, gets itspower and intelligence from the cube.andP;  At 400 dpi, the printer delivers afiner image than the 300-dpi Apple LaserWriter -- 160,000 dots per squareinch compared with the 90,000 dots per square inch at 300 dpi.andM;Each page is imaged in the cube before it is sent to the printer, which cantie up the system temporarily.andP;  Printing to the LaserWriter offloads the NeXTcomputer from imaging the document.andP;  Documents also can be sent to theLinotronic imagesetters to produce typeset-quality documents.andM;Digital audio.andP;  The CD-quality sound is impressive.andP;  Voice or soundannotations can be attached to FrameMaker documents, for example, which isuseful for work-group publishing environments.andM;Software.andP;  As a monochrome publishing solution, the NeXT system lacks severalpieces.andP;  For typefaces, only Adobe Systems Inc.'s Adobe + Pack is availablefor the NeXT computer, but, according to the Mountain View, Calif.-basedcompany, it plans to release its entire type library.andP;  There's also a needfor design-intensive software like Aldus PageMaker or FreeHand.andM;Technical support.andP;  NeXT provides technical support for registered developersand campus support people.andP;  Businessland Inc. provides support for customerswho purchase their NeXT equipment through its outlets.andM;Conclusion.andP;  The NeXT computer is like a Ferrari for the price of a Honda butwith a Honda engine under the hood.andP;  Yes, it has great electronic mail andnetworking features for workgroup collaboration, a superior imaging modelwith Display PostScript, a compelling interface and other powerful features,but it doesn't have enough raw horsepower for heavy-duty publishing projects.andM;With a faster processor, graphics coprocessors, speedier peripherals and morekey software programs, however, the NeXT machine has the potential to be thebest monochrome system for publishing applications.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
