<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-52-1038 </DOCNO><TEXT>Discusses degassing of highly productive panels in gassy coal seams. Suggestsways of selecting effective degassing of seams related to prevailingmining-geological conditions, extraction methods and ventilation systemsused. Deals with: vertical boreholes drilled from mine surface; connectingdrainage holes from worked out areas and boreholes into rock strata abovedomes over caved rock; removal of gas from behind barriers erected atjunctions of longwalls and ventilation roadways, and others. Lists methodsof complex degassing employed in Karaganda, Donetsk and Vorkuta coalbasins. Determines efficiency of complex degassing employing variousways of reducing gas emission.</TEXT></DOC>
