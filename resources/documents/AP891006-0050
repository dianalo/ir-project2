The group, the Federation of Committees of Mothers and Relativesof Political Prisoners, initially took 16 hostages when theystormed the embassy compound Thursday.   But Ambassador Jesus Fernandez was taken from the embassy in anambulance later in the day and two other diplomats were allowed toleave the offices.   Fernandez, who had heart bypass surgery two months ago, appearedto be breathing with difficulty as he left the building. He wastaken to a hospital and then sent home, the ambassador's wife,Janine, said.   The 20 human rights activists, who were mostly women, allowedConsul-General Humberto Murillo and First Secretary Rene Aldama toleave the third-floor offices to talk to Fernandez's wife throughthe back gate.   The consul said four women and nine men were still being held.Also in the offices but not being held hostage early today werefour journalists, three of them Americans.   A spokeswoman for the group said on condition of anonymity thatthe activists would leave the embassy today.   The action was to draw attention to alleged human rightsviolations under the rightist government that took power June 1 andto pressure the administration ``to take concrete measures'' to endthe decade-old civil war, the spokeswoman said.   The Federation of Committees for the past eight years hasprotested the kidnapping and killing of suspected leftists byrightist death squads.   Fernandez said some of the activists were armed. He did not saywhat weapons they carried, but reporters saw what appeared to be ahandgun tucked into the pantwaist of one woman.   There were also several packets of what looked like fuseswrapped in newspaper.   In a communique late Thursday, the government said thedemonstrators were armed with grenades and handguns. It called thetakeover ``a flagrant violation of the human rights of the peopletaken hostage.''   The government statement said the takeover was intended ``tofrustrate the dialogue process,'' a reference to preliminary peacetalks with leftist guerrillas that began last month in Mexico. Theyare scheduled to proceed Oct. 16-17 in Costa Rica.   Fernandez said the hostage-takers made no specific demands orstated conditions for eventually abandoning the embassy.   ``They have made their point,'' he said.   Several dozen soldiers and police surrounded the six-storyembassy building shortly after the takeover. But Fernandez askedthat the cordon be lifted, and by early today only 20 troopersmanned unobtrusive positions around the block.   The government of President Alfredo Cristiani considers thegroup _ as well as dozens of other union, peasant and human rightsorganizations _ leftist guerrilla fronts.   More than 70,000 people have been killed since a leftistguerrillas began their war against a succession of U.S.-backedgovernments a decade ago. Human rights groups say many victims havebeen civilians slain by right-wing death squads.   Cristiani's party, the Republican Nationalist Alliance, has beenlinked to the death squads. After taking office, Cristiani said heplanned to introduce draft legislation giving the police, armedforces and courts a freer hand against suspected subversives.   Opposition political, union and human rights organizations havedescribed the proposed measures as totalitarian.</TEXT></DOC>
