A left-wing lawmaker, who met recently with officials of thePalestine Liberation Organization in New York, said he believes thePLO has accepted the plan, which reportedly would shut the group outof participation in the first stage of Israeli-Palestinian peacetalks.   Also today, a group of Jews from 40 countries attending aconference in Israel that was organized by Prime Minister YitzhakShamir adopted a resolution expressing solidarity with Israel.   ``We are proud of Israel's adherence to its principles ofdemocracy, justice and freedom. ... We support the democraticallyelected government of national unity in its efforts to achieve peaceand security with its neighbors,'' the resolution said.   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, residents staged ageneral strike to mark a 1968 battle between Palestinians andIsraelis. Six Arabs were reportedly wounded by army gunfire inclashes in the territories.   The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said that under a U.S.-backed peaceplan, Israel would negotiate an interim settlement with electedPalestinian representatives from the occupied lands.   The PLO would join the talks in the second stage when a finalsettlement is negotiated, Haaretz said in an unattributed report.   The PLO has insisted on participating in every stage ofnegotiations.   ``The link between the two stages is an American promise to thePLO in the first stage that it will be included in the secondstage,'' Yossi Sarid of the leftist Citizens Rights Movement said onIsrael radio.   ``This has been accepted by the PLO, according to my knowledge,''said Sarid, who recently attended a symposium on the Middle Eastthat also drew PLO representatives. Sarid said his party proposed asimilar plan recently in Israel's parliament.   Washington has not announced such a peace plan, but Secretary ofState James A. Baker III said Tuesday the United States believed itwould be a ``major mistake'' to rule out eventual Israeli-PLO talksif they could lead to Middle East peace.   The left-leaning Labor Party, which governs in a coalitiongovernment with Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc, has said it wouldaccept elections in the occupied lands. Defense Secretary YitzhakRabin, Labor's No. 2 leader, has repeatedly called for them.   Ronnie Milo, minister of environmental protection and a leadingmember of the Likud bloc, hinted that Shamir would propose electionsin the occupied lands as part of his peace agenda, to be presentedto Washington next month.   Milo also suggested Israel would accept the Palestinianrepresentatives chosen in such elections even if they sympathizewith the PLO.   ``I'm convinced that the people elected will derive theirauthority from their voters, and not from sombody in Tunis,'' hesaid on Israel radio.   ``It's possible that in their hearts, they feel closeness orsympathy for one or another group outside the territories,'' Milosaid.   Such a compromise could help break the deadlock caused by thePLO's insistence on participation in all stages of peace talks andIsrael's vow never to negotiate with the group.   Shamir has refused to disclose details of his peace plan.However, American Jewish leaders visiting Jerusalem have suggestedthat Shamir and his political rival, Labor Party leader ShimonPeres, have united behind a compromise.</TEXT></DOC>
