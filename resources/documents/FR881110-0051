The NBECSis a general purpose statistical survey conducted for non-regulatory purposes.It is designed to meet the needs of public and private data users in additionto meeting the legislative requirements of EIA as specified in section52 of the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974, Pub. L. 93-275 asamended. Section 52 requires the EIA to establish a National Energy InformationSystem which ``* * * shall contain such information as is required to providea description of and facilitate analysis of energy supply and consumptionwithin and affecting the United States on the basis of such geographicareas and economic sectors as may be appropriate * * *''The NBECS provides basic statistical informaiton on the consumption of,and expenditures for, energy in U.S. commercial buildings, along with dataon energy-related characteristics of these buildings. EIA conducts thisnational sample survey of nonresidential buildings and their energy supplierson a triennial basis. Previous NBECS were conducted in 1979, 1983, and1986. The data from these surveys have been used by policy-makers at theFederal, regional, State, and local levels, and by the private sector forbenchmarking forecasting, policy evaluation and planning.The design of the 1989 NBECS is expected to yield national estiamtes basedon 6,000 completed interviews. Present plans call for data to be collectedthat will yeild valid estimates also for the four Census regions (Northwest,South, Midwest, and West).As in previous surveys, the 1989 NBECS will be conducted in two states.In the first stage, information about buildings are collected in the BuildingCharacteristics Survey through voluntary personal interviews with the owners,managers or tenants of a sample of buildings located throughout the UnitedStates. At the conclusion of the interview, the building respondent isasked to sign a waiver authorizing the survey contractor to obtain fuelconsumption records from the building's energy suppliers. In the secondstage, the Energy Supplier Survey, data concerning the actual consumptionof and expendutures for energy are obtained from records maintained byenergy suppliers to the building. This informaiton is obtained by meansof a mail survey conducted under EIA's mandatory data collection authority.The interviews with the building owners and managers will take place inthe late summer and fall of 1989. The initial mailings for the Energy SupplierSurvey will start in January, 1990 and nonresponse follow-up efforts willcontinue through September 1990.The proposed 1989 NBECS is not substantially different from the previoussurveys in its basic data requirements. Some changes have been made inorder to: Make the data collection more efficient; improve the reliabilityof the data; and reduce respondent burden.A series of proposed screening questions and a new survey form, Form EIA-871H,the Facility form have been developed for use on the 1989 NBECS. This newform has been developed to obtain better data on (1) cogeneration and (2)district heating and cooling that takes place in a campus, a complex ormulti-building facility such as a hosptial or a shopping mall.Because NBECS is a building survey and collects information about energyconsumed in a building, a problem arises when the building is part of afacility and receives energy from the facilitiy's central power plant.A series of proposed screening questions has been developed as part ofthe Building Characteristics Survey to determine (1) if the building islocated on a facility and (2) if the building receives energy from a centralpower located on that facility. If so, Form EIA-871H, the proposed Facilityform, will then be sent during the Energy Supplier Survey to the facilityon which the building is located. This new form will gather the informationnecessary to permit disaggregation of consumption data for the sampledbuilding.Destermination if any of the energy generated at the facility is from acogeneration system would also be obtained from this proposed new form.Previous NBECS surveys asked about cogeneration systems only in the sampledbuilding themselves. Although there are indications that the number ofpackaged cogeneration units designed to serve a single building is growing,cogeneration in the commercial sector is more likely to be found in a largefacility such as a college, hospital, and shopping mall rather than inan individual building, such as a church. Therefore, since most of thebuildings on facilities that meet the sampling criteria to be includedin the NBECS survey do not contain the cogeneration equipment for the facility,a major segment of the consumption of energy produced through cogenerationmight be missed wihout the proposed new Facility form.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>To obtain additional information or copies of the proposedforms, contact Ms. Julia D.

Background</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">II. Current Actions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">III. Written Comments</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background</ITAG>The proposed 198 NBECS will use essentially the same sample design andquestionnaires that were used on the 1986 survey. Comments on the 1986NBECS were solicited in a March 11, 1986, <T4>Federal Register</T4> Notice (51 FR 8351). That version of the NBECSwas modified on the basis of those comments and the EEUD's experience fromprevious surveys.The proposed 1989 NBECS design utilizes experience gained from the administrationand processing of the 1986 NBECS, and on consultations with respondents,trade association representatives and data users.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Current Actions</ITAG>EIA proposes to make the changes described below to the 1986 NBECS formsfor use in the 1989 survey. These changes are being made to better servethe needs of data users, to streamline the administration and processingof the survey and to improve overall data quality.Specific changes in data items from the 1986 NBECS are discussed below.<T3>Form EIA-871A-Building Characteristics Questionnaire and AuthorizationForm.</T3> Most of the changes made to the Building Characteristics Questionnairewere to clarify instructions, definitions and the intent of the questionsto both the respondent and the interviewer. As a result, questions havebeen combined, reworded, reformatted, and in some cases dropped altogether.In addition, several interviewer self-edits have been added to ensure thatthe interviewer has obtained all the pertinent information on energy sourcesused and energy end uses from the respondent before leaving the building.Of greater importance is the addition of questions relating to the cogenerationand district heating and cooling issues discussed above. There is a needto collect better information on these two areas. For the 1989 NBECS itis proposed that additional questions be asked on Form EIA-871A if thebuilding is part of a facility or campus complex. If so, information willbe obtained on the address of the facility's power plant (if differentfrom the building), the use of a cogeneration system in the facility, andthe number of buildings and the total enclosed square footage of all thebuildings served by the power plant on the facility. As described below,the facility will then be mailed the proposed Form EIA-871H during theEnergy Supplier Survey.<T3>Energy Supplier Forms, Forms EIA-871B through F.</T3> The energy supplierforms are essentially the same as those used on previous surveys. Questionsand data items that were not found to be useful have been deleted. As aresult of our experiences with the 1986 survey, instructions have beenclarified, administrative questions have been modified to better obtainthe requested data and some questions have been added to help clarify dataresponses. For example, the question on fuel switching, which appearedon Form EIA-871C (Usage of Natural Gas), has been moved to the BuildingCharacteristics Survey after comments received from respondents indicatedthat most suppliers of natural gas could not provide the information onback-up fuels used.<T3>Form EIA-871G, Construction Improvements and Maintenance and RepairsSupplement.</T3> This is a special supplement designed and collected forthe U.S. Bureau of the Census at the end of the Building CharacteristicsSurvey. It is planned that it will be administered again in the 1989 survey.As in previous surveys, this form will be cleared through OMB by the Bureauof the Census.<T3>Energy Supplier Form, Form EIA-871H, Facility Form.</T3> A new formis under consideration that will capture better information at the facilitylevel on (1) district heating and cooling and (2) cogeneration that takesplace on a multi-building facility, such as a campus or complex. Sinceit may be implemented, it is presented here for comment.Because the NBECS is a building survey and collects information about energyconsumed in the building, a problem arises when a building is part of afacility and receives energy from a central power plant. Usually buildingson a facility are not individually metered for this energy making it difficultto isolate the consumption for the sampled building. To correct this situation,the EIA is proposing a new form, Form EIA-871H, to obtain information onthe total consumption of primary fuels, the total number of buildings onthe facility and other information that will assist in the disaggregationof consumption data for the individual buildings located on the facility.The proposed Form EIA-871H will also be used to help obtain better informationon cogeneration. Previous NBECS surveys asked about cogeneration at thebuilding level (Questions H-1 to H-3 on Form EIA-871A). For the most part,cogeneration identified by these questions would tend to be performed byrelatively small packaged cogeneration units. However, the EIA is concernedthat by focusing on the building, a major portion of the consumption ofenergy through cogeneration has been missed: Cogeneration systems locatedin an on-site power plant that provide the building with district heatingand/or cooling. Thus, questions have been developed for the proposed newForm EIA-871H to determine (1) if electricity is cogenerated on the facility;and (2) if so, how many kilowatt-hours of electricity were generated in1989; (3) the total generating capacity of the equipment; and (4) if thefacility has been designated a Qualifying Facility (QF) under the PublicUtility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Written Comments</ITAG>The following general guidelines are provided to assist in the preparationof comments. When providing comments, please indicate the form to whichthe comment applies: (1) The Building Characteristics Questionnaire (FormEIA-871A); (2) the Energy Supplier Forms (EIA-871B through F); (3) theConstruction Improvements and Maintenance and Repairs Supplement (FormEIA-871G); or (4) the Facility Form (Form EIA-871H).As a potential data user: A. Can you use data at the levels of detail indicated on the forms (orat higher levels of aggregation, if necessary)?B. For what purpose would you use the data? Please be specific. C. How could the forms be improved to better meet your specific data needs?D. Are there alternative sources for the data: What are they? Do you usethem, What are their deficiencies?
