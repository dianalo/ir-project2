 These computers, in orderto work together, must have some way to share information.andP;  Theoptions available for such transfers include transferringcompatible data files; using e-mail, specialized transfersoftware, or certain disk drives with multi-format capabilities;transferring files to and then from tape backups; using formattranslation software; using alternate format coprocessor boardsand transferring files through peripherals or over networks.andP;  Eachof these options is discussed and 37 different products arepresented as examples.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Product:   Apple Macintosh (Microcomputer) (usage)IBM PC (Microcomputer) (usage).andO;Topic:     Software packagesElectronic mail systemsFile TransferTechnologyComparisonTape Drives.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>MAC AND PC EVEN THE MOST STRIDENT PC booster would have to agree that we nowlive in a world where integration between the PC environment and theMacintosh environment is essential and inevitable.andP;  Both offer valuableadvantages, and improving PC-to-Mac communication can only increase overallproductivity.andP;  No longer do we question the ability to integrate the twosystems; instead we try to find the best way to do it.andM;PC-to-Mac communication has evolved to the point where there is a whole cropof products, in a wide price range, for exchanging data, sharing peripherals,and forming heterogeneous networks.andP;  The trick lies in determining what youneed to do, how frequently you need to do it, and how complex your setup is.andM;To help you decide which method of transfer is best for you, it's a good ideato look at how the two data formats differ.andP;  There are currently seven diskformats in the personal computer arena.andP;  The Mac use 400K, 800K, and, mostrecently, 1.44MB 3 1/2-inch floppy disks.andP;  MS-DOS computers use either 360Kor 1.2MB 5 1/4-inch floppy disks or 720K or 1.44 MB 3 1/2-inch floppy disks.andO;The physical formatting of a disk determines the number of tracks, sectorsper track, and bytes per sector.andP;  IBM formats through DOS with MFM (ModifiedFrequency Modulation), and Apple uses a technique called GCR (Group CharacterRecording).andP;  When the disks are formatted, a file system moderates theorganizationof data on the disks.andP;  Once again, the two schemes areincompatible: IBM uses the MS-DOS file system and Apple uses HFS(Hierarchical File System).andM;The need to overcome this incompatibility has encouraged third-party vendors,as well as Apple, to develop products that bridge the gap between the twosystems.andM;TRANSFERRING COMPATIBLEandM;DATA FILESandM;There are several application programs on the market that are mutuallycompatible and create data that can be transferred without translation.andP;  Thismeans that some PC programs can create and save data files in a format thatcan be read directly into a Mac application and vice versa.andP;  Many programs,especially word processors, are being written with a standard DCA (DocumentContent Architecture) conversion utility.andP;  By saving a document in DCAformat, you can transfer it into a different program in a file formatcompatible with that application.andP;  Furthermore, the DCA conversion utility iscapable of preserving most of your text file's formatting codes.andM;Some completely compatible programs that need no DCA translation include thePC and Mac versions of Microsoft Word, WordPerfect, PageMaker, MicrosoftExcel, VersaCAD, and AutoCAD.andP;  Also able to communicate without translationare Adobe's Illustrator (Mac) and Ventura Publisher (PC), Lotus 1-2-3 (PC),and dBase Mac and dBase III Plus (PC).andM;USING E-MAILandM;The simplest way to transfer data files that don't need translation betweenMacs and PCs is through electronic mail services such as MCI Mail or ATandamp;TMail.andP;  Recently, however, other companies have been designating e-mailsystems specifically for Macs and PCs.andP;  Desktop Express, developed jointly byApple, Dow Jones, and MCI, allows you to exchange Macintosh files with DOScomputers running Lotus Express or send text messages to MCI users.andP;  It ispriced at $195.andP;  Dayna Mail, from Dayna Communications, is a server-basedapplication for Apple and IBM computers.andP;  It costs $295 per five-user packand enables you to send and receive messages across AppleShare, TOPS, 3+, andNetWare LANs.andP;  Microsoft Mail for the PC on an AppleTalk network sends phonemessages, memos, graphics, and entire disk files between PCs and Macs on anetwork.andM;TRANSFERandM;SOFTWAREandM;A more comprehensive transfer method involves using special software.andP;  Thefirst complete package to bridge the gap between PCs and Macs was PC to Macand Back from Dilithium Press.andP;  It is still on the market (at $149) but isunable to run on the newer Macintosh II or IIx models.andP;  PC to Mac and Backtransfers BASIC programs, ASCII text, and binary files by modem or directcable connection.andP;  A more recent software duo from Dynamic MicroprocessorAssociates allows remote computing from any Macintosh computer equipped withthe $99 PC MacTerm and a PC running the $145 pcAnywhere III.andP;  With thiscombination you can control PC programs, data, peripherals, and internalcards through a modem, a direct cable link, or an AppleTalk network (with PCMacTerm/Network, $395).andP;  It is even possible to link to a PC and collaborateon a spreadsheet or word processor with both the Mac and PC keyboards activeat the same time.andM;HARDWARE-BASEDandM;DATA TRANSFERSandM;Special drives, such as the Apple PC 5.25 External Drive ($399), alsotransfer data.andP;  If you are a Mac SE or Mac II user, you can read and writefiles from MS-DOS formatted floppy disks to your Mac.andP;  The drive is directlylinked to the Macintosh through the Apple Macintosh SE-Bus Drive Card or theApple Macintosh II PC Drive Card ($129 each).andP;  Another external drive thatlets all Macintosh systems ead and write to DOS disks is the well-knownDaynaFile from Dayna Communications.andP;  It is available as a single- ordual-drive unit and accepts all PC-compatible disk formats.andP;  Prices for thesingle unit start at $650; dual drives sell for $905 and up.andP;  Although theDaynaFile is able to read, write, and format high-density Mac disks, itdoesn't accept 400K and 800K and Mac disks.andP;  It connects to the SCSI port ofyour Mac and can be daisy-chained to up to six other peripheral devices.andM;The most recent addition to the add-on-drive family is the Apple FDHDInternal Drive, priced at $599.andP;  It is similar to but more sophisticatedthanthe DaynaFile.andP;  The FDHD drive can read, write, and format all Mac,MS-DOS, and OS/2d disks and even includes a high-density-disk detector thatautomatically formats to the correct disk capacity.andP;  The latest Macintoshsystem, the IIx, is equipped with the FDHD Internal Drive.andM;Another hardware solution, the Copy II PC Deluxe Option Board from CentralPoint Software, enables you to read and write Mac data files if yiou have aPS/2 Model 25 or 30 or an AT compatible with an internal 3-1/2-inch floppydisk drive.andP;  The $159 board is supplied with the Macintosh Control Program(MCP), which controls the transferring of data in and out of the Macintoshformat.andP;  To facilitate these transfers, the MCP uses a command format that isalmost identical to DOS.andP;  Batch files that imitate the syntax of DOS commandsare used, and an M is placed in front of all commands.andP;  For instance, MFORMATwill format a Macintosh floppy disk.andM;TAPE BACKUP SOLUTIONSandM;Transferring by tape backup is an innovative idea, and two companies haveintroduced such systems.andP;  Tecmar has developed a $395 interface card calledNu-Link that allows IBM and Apple users to share tape-drive systems.andP;  Thecard goes into a Mac II or IIx, and you use tape cartridges to migrate datato and from any PC.andP;  The second company, Irwin Magnetics, has also developeda range of tape-drive systems that permit data to be transferred betweencomputers.andP;  You just send the data from your Mac to a minicartridge in anIrwin Tape Backup System/Minicartridge Tape Drive, load the tape into aPC-based tape drive, then download the Macintosh files onto your DOS harddisk in the right format.andP;  The Mac drives start at $1,395, and the PC unitsare priced at $699 and up.andM;TRANSLATION SOFTWAREandM;SOLUTIONSandM;Not every program can be transferred without the help of file conversions.andO;Many Macintosh applications contain codes that are not recognizable by PCapplications (and vice versa).andP;  Frequently these codes signify formattingdetails like underlining, bold-faced, and tab settings.andP;  Translationapplications are designed to exchange the data files while preserving theformatting attributes of the program from which they came.andP;  An application'scodes are translated into codes that the receiving program can understand.andM;A translation program with text and binary transfer options lets you transferany type of file, including graphical formats that are common to both PC andMacintosh environments.andM;Apple offers its own version of translation software, the Apple File ExchangeUtility, for $49.andP;  The utility can be used with multiple translatorssimultaneously by indicating which files you want translated.andP;  The programselects the appropriate translator from the available set.andP;  It includestranslators for text, binary, and DCA-RFT (Revisable Form Text) formats andis packaged with several Apple products, including the Macintosh II PC DriveCard, the Macintosh SE-Bus Drive Card, and the $249 Apple LocalTalk PC Card.andO;It can also be used for translation with the Macintosh IIx, the FDHD InternalDrive, DaynaFile, and the PC 5.25 External Drive.andM;The best-known translation software package is MacLink Plus from DataViz.andO;The $195 program comes with Macintosh software, PC software in 5-1/4-and3-1/2-inch formats, and cabling.andP;  MacLink Plus is a Macintosh-orientedprogram that is displayed as a Mac window to provide complete visibility fortransfers and translations.andP;  It provides access to several DOS devices: adesktop PC; a laptop connected to the Mac; a printer port with the serialcable: a remote PC connected through a modem, remote disks from an AppleTalkserver; or one of the add-on Macintosh/DOS disk drives.andP;  MacLinkPlus/Translators, a complete library of file translators, is sold as aseparate module for $159.andP;  It may be used in conjunction with MacLink Plus orthe Apple File Exchange Utility.andP;  Dayna Communications offers DaynaTranslation Software, a customized version of MacLink Plus that works withthe DaynaFile.andM;Traveling Software markets a translation package similar to MacLink Pluscalled Lap-Link Mac.andP;  It retails for $139.95 and includes software andcabling for both PCs and Macs.andP;  Lap-Link Mac is a PC-oriented program thatmust be installed on both computers to exchange files in both directions.andO;All actions are initiated on the PC,and the program is capable of binarytransfers.andM;Insignia Solutions' SoftPC, a $595 software product for the Mac SE and MacII, operates on a different concept.andP;  It emulates PC-XT hardware: aprocessor, 640K of RAM, CGA video, two serial ports, a parallel port, aMicrosoft Mouse, ROM BIOS, one 360K floppy disk drive, and three hard disks.andO;Insignia Solutions calls it &quot;synthetic hardware.&quot;andP;  You can't insert PC disksinto your Mac drive, however, A utility called SlavePC transfers data from aPC through a serial cable into the Mac, and you can save PC files to Macdisks, cut and paste text and graphics, convert PC program printing codes toMacintosh print information, and print to any PC printer that is connected toyour Mac's serial port.andM;TRANSLATION HARDWAREandM;SOLUTIONSandM;Following the same principle as SoftPC is the AST Mac286 MS-DOS coprocessorfrom AST Research.andP;  The $1,599 Mac286 brings AT performance to the MacintoshII, including 640K of memory for DOS applications.andP;  On screen, the boardcreates a look like a Macintosh application, with a window from which you cancopy and paste text or graphics from DOS applications; save PC and Mac filesto the same disk; toggle the Macintosh mouse to emulate a Microsoft Mouse;and gain access to LaserWriter and ImageWriter printers.andP;  Obviously, you arenot able to insert DOS formatted disks into your Macintosh II.andP;  You need toseek out additional hardware alternatives.andP;  DOS applications can be loadedthrough the Apple PC 5.25 drive, the DaynaFile 3-1/2-inch drive, or anetwork, and they run exactly as they do on an AT.andM;PERIPHERAL SHARINGandM;If you are not interested in sharing data with a Macintosh but would like totake advantage of a high-quality Apple printer, the $399 AppleTalk PC Card isa good (if slow) choice.andP;  The half-length card connects your PC to anAppleTalk network through the Apple LocalTalk Cabling System ($75 per kit),allowing you to print documents on an Apple LaserWriter or LaserWriter Plus.andO;The TOPS network operating system also has an optional module called TOPS NETPrint ($189) that allows peripheral sharing.andP;  With additional software, suchas the InBox from TOPS, you can share information with Macintoshes on thenetwork.andP;  The InBox software is priced at $249 for one message center andthree clients.andM;FILE AND PERIPHERALandM;SHARING VIAandM;NETWORKSandM;To share file information as well as peripheral hardware, you have to seekout network solutions.andP;  One of the first network systems developed tointegrate PCs and Macintoshes was the TOPS network from Sun Microsystems.andP;  Ona TOPS system, every computer on the network can act as a file server ornetwork station and can access printers, disk space, and data files.andO;Requests from each machine are translated into codes that can be recognizedby the TOPS Network Software installed in any of the other computers on thenetwork.andP;  To hook your PC into an AppleTalk network equipped with TOPSsoftware you must use the FlashCard interface card.andP;  TOPS Network Softwarefor the Macintosh sells for $249 per station; the PC version is $289 perstation.andM;3Com approaches the file-sharing problem from a PC joint of view, allowingMacintoshes to link into Ethernet.andP;  3Com's 3+Mac, priced at $495 per server,is an extension of the 3+Share network operating system and lets the Mac useraccess the network through a LocalTalk port on the file server.andP;  The fileserver allows several users to access the same file and print services.andM;Apple gets into the networking picture with the Apple LocalTalk PC Card, a$249 half-length card for the PC bus that allows a PC user to access theAppleTalk network through LocalTalk cabling.andP;  In conjunction with AppleSharePC software ($149 per station), the card allows you to utilize email, printservices, storage space, files, and peripherals as a Mac user.andP;  The inclusionof the Apple File Exchange Utility lets you share files created underdifferent operating systems.andP;  Also available is the $699 Apple Macintosh IIEtherTalk Interface Card, which plugs into a Macintosh II slot and providesdirect connection to an Ethernet-based network.andM;Dayna Communications offers DaynaTalk, which is available as either a $189connector box that plugs into the printer port of your Macintosh and theninto a LocalTalk connector box, or as a network interface card for the PC($289) that provides you with LocalTalk connectivity.andP;  Used either way,DaynaTalk enhances the performance of LocalTalk by increasingdata-transmission speeds.andP;  It can be used with any AppleTalk-compatiblenetwork that uses LocalTalk cabling.andM;The Kinetics division of Excelan manufactures products that connect Applecomputers to Ethernet networks.andP;  EtherPort II ($695) and EtherPort SE ($850)connect Macintosh II or SE computers to networks with EtherTalkcompatibility.andP;  The $2,795 FastPath, a gateway box, provides Ethernetconnectivity for AppleTalk LANs.andP;  Kinetics also offers Host Access Software,a $595 collection of software products that gives you Macintosh direct accessto multiple hosts on Ethernet.andP;  It contains Telnet, which allows you to logon to a TCP/IP host computer, and a utility that lets you list local orremote directories and transfer files from one host to another.andM;Novell has also embraced the Mac environment.andP;  NetWare for the Mac ($200)provides a gateway on the server that allows your Mac to use networkresources transparently.andP;  Your Mac can hook up to the server throughLocalTalk or Ethernet.andP;  Apple Computer Inc.andP;
