West German authorities arrested 13 Palestinians in raids inseveral West German cities on Wednesday and Thursday and seized alarge quantity of explosives, detonating devices and heavy-caliberweapons.   ``There were so many weapons you could arm an army,'' onesecurity source said.   Security sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity,declined to specify the target of the planned attack.   The sources said three of the suspects arrived in West Germanyfrom a foreign country, while the other 10 lived in West Germany.   One man came to West Germany from Damascus at the beginning ofthe year, while the other two arrived the past two weeks. Thesources declined to specify where the other two men came from.   The sources said the suspects had been under police surveillancefor some time.   ``We had them under control,'' one source said.   The arrested men were believed to be from the Popular Front forthe Liberation of Palestine-General Command, a Syrian-controledfaction opposed to Palestine Liberation Organization leader YasserArafat.   The faction is headed by Ahmad Jibril, a former Syrian armycaptain.   Western and Middle East intelligence reports say the group'sfighters have been leased to the Syrian and Libyan secret servicesin the past to carry out assasinations and bombings.   The most spectacular action by the group came last November, whenthree guerrillas flying motorized hang-gliders infiltrated intoIsrael across the Lebanese border and clashed with Israeli soldiers.Six Israeli soldiers died and seven were wounded before the threeguerrillas were also killed.   Security sources in Germany declined to give any details aboutthe arrested men. They said some of the suspects may be releasedtoday for lack of firm evidence but that the three suspectedringleaders who had arrived from abroad would be kept in custody.   Jochen Ruhland, chief prosecutor in Duesseldorf, said the 13Palestinians were arrested in raids throughout the country Wednesdayand Thursday.   He said police searched 16 apartments and offices in West Berlin,Hamburg, Frankfurt and Neuss, just outside Duesseldorf, and seizedexplosives, detonators and incriminating documents.   West German authorities previously had said they were concernedabout possible terrorist attacks linked to the Frankfurt trial ofconfessed TWA hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem.   However, Ruhland told The Associated Press that ``we have noclues'' of any possible connection between the arrested Palestiniansand Hamadi.   A Frankfurt judicial official, also speaking on the condition ofanonymity, said authorities recently circulated warnings about plansfor an imminent strike by Palestinian terrorists.</TEXT></DOC>
