The source, speaking privately, said the court in Bratislavaacquitted Hana Ponicka, Anton Selecky and Vladimir Manak, who werecharged with sedition last summer together with Jan Carnogursky,another activist.   All five had signed a statement urging Slovaks to mark the 21stanniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of August 1968, whichcrushed the brief ``Prague spring'' of reform, by laying flowers inmemory of the victims.   About 100 supporters, who could not get into the court buildingin Bratislava for the two-day trial, shouted ``Long live freedom!''and ``Long live Dubcek!'' after the verdicts were announced.   Alexander Dubcek, the Communist Party chief who led the 1968reform and was disgraced afterward, attended the trial.   The court changed original charges of sedition and subversionagainst Kusy to ``harming state interests abroad'' under Article112 of the criminal code, which appeared to be a lesser charge, thesource in Vienna said. The maximum prison term for sedition is fiveyears.   Kusy, a party Central Committee secretary in 1968, was expelledfrom the party after the invasion.   Carnogursky, a Roman Catholic activist who has been held sinceAug. 14, faces charges of sedition and subversion, but his trialwas suspended because his lawyer is ill.   He was brought to the courtroom in handcuffs Tuesday and askedto testify as a witness, but refused, said Palach Press, anewsletter based in London that monitors human rights inCzechoslovakia. It said Carnogursky would be tried next Monday andTuesday.   Last week, about 200 people demonstrated in Bratislava for hisrelease.</TEXT></DOC>
