The industrial services concern said the plant will process 3,000 tons of trash daily and have a daily capacity of 72,500 kilowatts of electricity. The power will be bought by Dominion Resources Inc.'s Virginia Electric Power Co. unit. Ogden will contribute $33 million toward the construction cost, with the rest coming from part of the proceeds of an industrial-revenue bond issue.    Construction is scheduled to begin later this year, and commercial operation is expected by late 1990. The facility will provide the primary means of garbage disposal for 1.3 million residents of Fairfax County and the District of Columbia, Ogden said. </TEXT></DOC>
