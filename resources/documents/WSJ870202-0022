The report states that most recipients in the work-related efforts don't reach the goal of leaving the government's main welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Childen, or AFDC.    &quot;Most participants ended up in low-paying and/or part-time jobs, so that in half the programs, fewer than 48% of the participants left AFDC after finding work,&quot; says the report, which is being released today.    The GAO studied 61 programs in 38 states at the request of Rep. Ted Weiss (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House intergovernmental relations and human resources subcommittee. In a statement released by his office, he said, &quot;The minimal services these people receive cannot be expected to prepare them for productive, well-paid, lasting jobs.&quot;    According to the report, job-search assistance, rather than more-expensive training and education programs, was the predominant feature of the federal work incentive, or WIN program. Many welfare specialists say child care and transportation are important elements in any welfare-work program. Almost all of the programs provided those services, but half spent less than 6.4% of their 1985 budgets on child care, and the median program spending for transportation was 6.9% of the budgets.    Though they receive most of their funds from the federal government, welfare programs are operated by the states. In 1981 and 1982, Congress permitted the states to try various work-program options. But since 1981, WIN funds have declined 70%, limiting the resources for education and training, according to the report.    President Reagan's budget calls for elimination of the WIN program. He also plans to ask Congress to change federal welfare regulations so that states can have greater flexibility in designing their programs. The GAO said giving states greater flexibility could help &quot;preserve some of the more desirable features of programs that have begun in the past five years.&quot;    Rep. Weiss believes that administration cuts in welfare funding will prevent recipients from getting the services they need to leave welfare. &quot;This report confirms that work programs alone cannot be expected to produce massive reductions in the welfare rolls,&quot; he said. &quot;If the Reagan administration fails to recognize the need for comprehensive education and training and support services, its work-welfare initiatives are doomed.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
