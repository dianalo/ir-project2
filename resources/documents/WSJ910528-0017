General Dynamics Corp. Chairman William Anders, whorecently picked up $800,000 as part of a new executivecompensation package, abruptly canceled plans to tour thecompany's San Diego facilities this week after it becameclear that employees were going to try to disrupt the visit.</LP><TEXT>   Workers say they're steamed that Mr. Anders and othersenior officials received fat bonuses, while the St.Louis-based defense contractor intends to cut one-third ofits jobs, or some 30,000 positions, over the next four years.About 16,000 people work for General Dynamics in San Diego.   The chairman had been scheduled to deliver a banquetspeech to a gathering of San Diego managers tonight. Butmembers of the Machinists union announced plans to hold araucous rally to protest. &quot;Let's tell the CEO where to go]]&quot;says a union flier handed out to employees last week. &quot;ComeGive Bill Anders an earful.&quot;   Michael Keel, executive vice president of GeneralDynamics' missiles and electronics division, says he askedMr. Anders to postpone his trip because &quot;it is apparent . . .that there are some misunderstandings and concerns that needto be addressed.&quot;   Vicki Powers, a business representative for MachinistsDistrict Lodge 50, says the union will still hold itsdemonstration. But she's miffed Mr. Anders isn't coming.&quot;It's just going to create more ill will,&quot; she says. &quot;If hereally thinks he's right, he should be able to tell thatstraight to the employees.&quot;   But Mr. Anders, somewhat exasperated, says he isn'trunning away from anything. &quot;Why get involved in a shoutingmatch?&quot; he asks.   Earlier this month, Mr. Anders and 24 other top executivesreceived &quot;gain-sharing&quot; awards equal to their base salarieswhen the company's stock price for the 10th consecutive dayhit at least $10 above the $25.5625 level that it stood atwhen the plan was adopted last February. For each subsequent$10 jump in the share price, the executives get additionalbonuses equal to twice their base salaries.   Mr. Anders, noting that the gain-sharing provision is onlyone part of a broad new incentive program, says he hopes theemployees eventually will understand that what's beingimplemented &quot;is good for them in the long run.&quot;   Clearly, though, he still has a lot of convincing to do.Circulating in the San Diego plants last week was a cartoon,first published in a local newspaper, that shows employeestrudging up a flight of stairs and hurling themselves into agiant shredder. At the base of the contraption, executivesare collecting bonus checks.   Ms. Powers says employees also had heard that Mr. Andershates the color pink -- and were therefore planning to dressin pink from head to toe when he toured the Tomahawk cruisemissile factory.   Retorts Mr. Anders: &quot;I have no great feeling for pink oneway or another.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
