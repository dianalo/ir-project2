Division of SpaceSpace Craft.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The first Anik-E satellite left the Canadian Space Agency's David FloridaLaboratory Monday where it was assembled and underwent environmental testing.andM;The satellite is now on its way to Kourou, French Guiana where it will belaunched on the European launch vehicle, Ariane IV, scheduled for late March1991.andM;Built for Telesat Canada by Spar Aerospace and its Canadian team, the twoAnik-E communications satellites will extend available channels for domesticcommercial usage which will benefit Canadians into the next century.andP;  EachAnik-E can carry the equivalent of 56 television channels, as well as longdistance telephone and data communications.andM;The second satellite is currently in its final test phase at the DavidFlorida Laboratory.andP;  This activity is expected to be completed in May 1991.andO;The launch date has tentatively been set for July 1991.andM;The David Florida Laboratory has been a major component of Canada's spaceefforts since it was built in the early 1970s.andP;  There are few like it in theworld.andP;  The laboratory provides aerospace testing services and three largeclean rooms suitably equipped for the assembly of satellites and other spacehardware.andP;  A variety of other chambers and systems can be used to simulateconditions in space.andM;The David Florida Laboratory (DFL) is an integral part of the Canadian SpaceAgency's facilities, and is used for the testing, assembly and integration ofsatellites and other spacecraft.andP;  The DFL's contribution to Canadiantelecommunications has been substantial, and its role in the development ofthe Canadian telecommunications and aerospace industries has become a keyfactor in the success of Canada's Space Program.andM;The DFL has made a substantial impact on satellite communications in Canadaand continues to play a major role in the development of Canada'scommunications and space industries.andP;  As a result of past achievements theDFL is also in growing demand as a facility for environmental testing andintegration of spacecraft world-wide, and it is expected that the DFL'scontinuing service will be a key element in maintaining the success ofCanada's national space program.andM;Built in the early 1970s to assist in the development of the joint Canada-USCommunications Technology Satellite, HERMES, the laboratory has sincesupported a number of major programs and projects.andP;  The most extensive use ofthe laboratory facilities has been in support of ANIK-C2, D1 and D2; theShuttle Remote Manipulator System (CANADARM); Brazilsat S1 and S2; and theEuropean Space Agency Olympus (structural, thermal and flight models).andM;DFL employees have recently completed environmental testing of the ANIK-E1and are expected to complete the final testing of the ANIK-E2 in May 1991.andO;In addition, preliminary planning has been initiated for MSAT, Radarsat andthe Canadian contribution to the Space Station Freedom, the Mobile ServicingSystem (MSS).andM;The services offered by these extensive facilities include three large cleanrooms suitably equipped for the assembly of satellites and other spacehardware, a range of thermal vacuum chambers and an infrared testing systemfor verifying the thermal design and workmanship of spacecraft, and vibrationplus modal analysis for the qualification of the structural aspects.andM;Antennas and RF payloads may be evaluated using the DFL's anechoic chambers,shielded rooms and antenna ranges.andP;  The clean room facilities includecapabilities for spacecraft mass properties measurement and spin balance.andM;Another important component of DFL's operation is its commitment to thedevelopment of new test technologies to permit the qualification of spacehardware which defies testing by usual techniques due either to size,complexity or other limitations.andP;  New thermal, structural and RF payloadverification techniques will be required by future projects such as Radarsat,MSAT and the MSS.andM;In addition to the main functions of the DFL, the laboratory is wellsupported by an infrastructure necessary to an operation of this scope.andO;These support facilities include offices, conference rooms, storage areas,check-out rooms and small in-house mechanical, electrical and electronicshops for custom design and device construction.andM;Located adjacent to Communication Canada's Communications Research Centre(CRC), the DFL also has ready access to a range of services offered by theCRC.andP;  For complex mechanical design or prototypes the laboratory has accessto the Prototype Development Services of CRC which include mechanical andchemical laboratories as well as a design office.andP;  Equipment calibration,alignment and maintenance on the majority of DFL equipment, as well astraceability and reliability verification of electrical equipment isconducted by the Instrument Services section of CRC.andM;The David Florida Laboratory was named in honour of one of Canada's foremostpioneers in space research, C. David Florida.andP;  David Florida was the Directorof the Canadian National Space Telecommunications Laboratory and Manager ofthe International Satellites for Ionospheric Studies (ISIS) program.andP;  Inaddition, just prior to his death in 1971, he was selected Manager of theCommunications Technology Satellite (CTS) or Hermes program.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
