The big New York developer met with dozens of creditors earlier this week in an attempt to restructure loans on the remainder of its portfolio, real estate sources say.    &quot;Broadway Management is in active discussions with its lenders and is optimistic that we can all arrive at terms that will permit us to continue as a viable organization,&quot; a Broadway spokesman said.    Broadway's difficulty paying its bills has led it to yield effective control over about half of its 26 properties to one of its investment partners, Berisford Capital Corp. Berisford is a U.S. unit of Berisford International PLC, London, a publicly held firm that had 1988 revenue of about $4.6 billion.    In a real estate partnership, when one partner can't meet its financial obligations another can take over debt payments and seize control of the assets, as happened here, real estate experts say. However, in the Broadway situation, the official ownership rights of each party are yet to be determined. For tax and other reasons, it's not always in the best interests of the controlling company to assume ownership.    Despite what many insist is the solid, long-term value of Broadway's properties, which industry sources estimate are worth several billion dollars, real estate people see the company's troubles as a cautionary tale about overreaching in the high-stakes world of Manhattan real estate.    They say Broadway is only one of a group of highly leveraged Manhattan developers that have spread themselves too thin in a rising market -- and are unprepared to wait out a downturn.    The recent events mark an unhappy turn in the fortunes of Joseph Neumann, a principal in Broadway Management, who bought into the expanding New York real estate market during the 1980s by buying older, well-located buildings that needed substantial work. Many of them were in lower Manhattan's financial district.    Outbidding competitors, the developer paid top dollar for the properties, spent still more on improvements and borrowed money at high interest rates. In a rising market, it looked as if he had a good, although risky, investment.    But, industry people say, Mr. Neumann bit off more than he could chew in 1987 when he paid an exceptionally high price of $350 million to acquire a 15-property portfolio. Now, in a softer Manhattan commercial real estate market, Broadway has been unable to meet interest and other debt payments. Berisford, with its deeper pockets, believes it can do better.    &quot;We can go the long term,&quot; says Sholem Greenbaum, Berisford executive vice president. He says his company is paying all capital expenditures, and managing and leasing the buildings, formerly Broadway's role as operating partner.    Industry people say the buildings include 111 Broadway, 115 Broadway and 15 Park Row in the Wall Street area, 270 and 280 Madison Avenue, and 500 Fifth Avenue on the corner of 42nd Street. The 1.3 million-square-foot Blue Hill office complex in Rockland County, N.Y., is also reportedly part of the Berisford portfolio.    Mr. Neumann still holds other midtown and downtown properties not linked to Berisford, but industry people say he has little remaining equity in those buildings, which are now primarily owned by his lenders.    The financial district, where many of the Broadway buildings are located, has experienced a marked increase in office vacancies, putting pressure on landlords. &quot;There's no need and too much inventory -- the worst of all worlds,&quot; says Gil Robinov, vice chairman of Riverbank Realty Co., a New York real estate firm. There is also a great deal of sublease space available, which drags down rental prices because anxious tenants subleasing space are often willing to make low-cost deals, Mr. Robinov says.    In addition, there's a mismatch between available tenants and the current supply of office space, explains Don Schnabel, vice chairman of Julien J. Studley Inc., a real estate brokerage and consulting firm.    Tenants seeking state-of-the-art office facilities will pay about twice as much for space in new towers with high ceilings, modern ventilation and electrical systems to accommodate heavy computer use, he says. Even when an owner funds an extensive renovation, certain structural limitations can prevent an old building from becoming as good as new. </TEXT></DOC>
