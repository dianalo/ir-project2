Theconvergence ratio decreases faster than predicted by the simple geometricalscaling law when the initial gaseous D-T density of the target is increased.Reducing the convergence ratio by changing the driver pulse shape isnot energy efficient because the cold D-T cannot be assembled in thedesirable manner.
