The nation's 12,824 banks lost $744 million in theJuly-September quarter, off sharply from $7 billion in profits inthe second quarter and $7.3 billion in the first three months ofthe year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said.   For the first nine months, banks earned $13.7 billion, almost $5billion less than same period of 1988.   The third-quarter loss was the first negative quarter sincebanks lost $10.6 billion in the April-June period of 1987. Thatloss was also caused by large banks writing off developing countrydebt.   Meanwhile, FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman issued a new andmore pessimistic assessment of prospects for the insurance fundbacking bank deposits up to $100,000 per account, drawing criticismfrom Congress.   He said the fund will shrink between $250 million and $500million this year to about $13.8 billion, posting the second lossin its history. The fund declined by about $4 billion in 1988 whenbank failures hit a post-Depression record of 221. This year, bankfailures should top 200, but miss breaking last year's record, hesaid.   In September, Seidman had predicted his fund would break even orpost a slight loss. Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of theHouse Banking subcommittee on financial institutions, said the newestimate shows the FDIC should be more aggressively regulatingcommercial banks.   Annunzio likened Seidman to outgoing savings and loan regulatorM. Danny Wall, who endured grueling criticism from Congress forunderestimating the scope of the Sandamp;L crisis.   ``Bill Seidman should have spent more time doing his job at theFDIC instead of running around the country telling everyone what abad job Danny Wall was doing,'' Annunzio said in a preparedstatement.   FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney said Annunzio's charge was ``simplynot true,'' adding that Seidman's only public criticism of Wall hasbeen for the Sandamp;L regulator's decision to shift the supervision ofLincoln Savings and Loan Association, Irvine, Calif., from regionalexaminers in San Francisco to examiners in Washington.   Economist Robert Litan of the Brooking Institution, a Washingtonthink tank, said if banks' unrecognized losses are taken intoaccount the FDIC probably has reserves closer to $9 billion than to$13 billion.   Seidman has disputed that assessment, but, Litan noted, ``He'smoving closer to reality.''   The FDIC chairman said he revised his assessment of theinsurance fund because of growing bank losses on real estate loansfor commercial development and condo projects. He urged banks toexercise more caution in the area.   Although bank profits overall likely will bounce back in thefinal three months of 1989, the number of sour real estate loanswill continue to rise, he predicted.   ``I don't want to Scrooge up Christmas ... but I'm afraid thefourth quarter will show a continuation of the (real estate) trendswe see here,'' Seidman said.   Over the last 12 months, real estate loan growth has accountedfor nearly two-thirds of all bank asset growth, and now comprisesalmost one-fourth of all commercial bank assets.   Delinquent real estate loans constitute almost half of all sourloans nationally, he said. In the Northeast, the percentage ofdelinquent real estate loans has doubled in the past year, he said.   The states with the highest percentage of bad real estate loansat the end of the third quarter were Arizona, 12.28 percent; Texas,10.53 percent; Alaska, 10.40 percent; Oklahoma, 6.07 percent;Louisiana, 5.81 percent; Massachussets, 4.76 percent; New Mexico,4.24 percent; Connecticut, 3.85 percent; New York, 3.78 percent andNew Hampshire, 3.69 percent.   However, the problems in the oil-producing states have beenlong-standing and are improving. Markets in the Northeast continueto deteriorate.   The concentration of third-quarter losses shows the influence ofwrite-downs for developing country debt. Five of the nation's 10largest banks accounted for $5.3 billion loss.   Banks in four states loss money: New York, $5.7 billion;Arizona, $333 million; Texas, $219 million, and Louisiana, $7million. Banks in 46 states, Puerto Rico and the District ofColumbia reported earnings.   Private analysts predicted that several other large banks, mostnotably Citicorp, could add to Third World debt loss reserves inthe next few quarters. They said banks' real estate portfolioswould continue to deteriorate and that bank loans for leveragedbuyout deals would begin to show up as losses.   ``The real estate problem is serious and is dragging what wereonce considered rather pristine regional banks down into the muckwith Texas institutions,'' said economist Paul Getman of the WefaGroup, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm.</TEXT></DOC>
