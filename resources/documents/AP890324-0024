(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some legislators want the state to cash inon credit cards as a way of balancing demands for increased spendingand lower taxes.   A House committee on Thursday approved legislation that wouldhave the state issue MasterCard or Visa cards for a commission.   If approved by the full House during the next week, it would besent to the Senate.   This predominantly agricultural state of 804,000 residents couldreap in millions of dollars in extra revenue by sponsoring the card,said Democratic Rep. Mark O'Keefe.   Montana's chief tax collector, Revenue Director Ken Nordtvedt,thinks it's a good idea.   ``Every organization under the sun is doing this,'' he said. ``Ihave two of those cards in my pocket right now from fraternalorganizations. ...   ``And this being our centennial year, where there's a little moresense of pride in Montana, the Department of Revenue is certainlywilling to administer such a program,'' he said.   O'Keefe, who sponsored the legislation, said the idea came from aconstituent.   ``At first, I thought the guy was crazy,'' O'Keefe said. ``Butthe more I looked into it, it seemed it was not only legal but itmight work.''   The card would have a special Montana design and would be issuedby banks, which would assume all liability and would process thetransactions, O'Keefe said.   Each bank would pay the state a commission, perhaps 1 percent ofsales.   The plan could mean up to $7.6 million a year for the state,depending on the terms it negotiates with banks and how popular thecard becomes, O'Keefe said.   Such groups as labor unions, wildlife organizations and theNational Rifle Association sponsor such ``affinity'' cards, O'Keefesaid. Banks like the idea because it gives them a broader base ofcardholders and more interest income.   ``It's such a cutthroat industry that the affinity cards havebecome big business for banks,'' he said. ``It increases the numberof people who want to carry these cards and all of theseorganizations are making money on it.''   O'Keefe, who believes Montana would be the first governmententity in the nation to try the idea, took his proposal to the HouseTaxation Committee this week.   There, a lobbyist for the Montana League of Savings Institutionsliked it so much he proposed an amendment to allow savings and loansto participate along with banks.   The panel questioned whether state funds would be at risk undersuch a plan, as collateral for credit charged to the cards. ButO'Keefe said participating banks would assume all the risk.   The bill, approved 13-5 by the committee, calls for half themoney generated by commissions to go to the state's general fund.   The rest would be used for public schools, which must receivemore state money because of a February ruling by the state SupremeCourt overturning Montana's school finance system.   Using the card to support public schools would only be right,O'Keefe said, considering all the retired Montanans who spend theirsummers in the mountains but desert Montana in the winter for theSunbelt.   ``All of our snowbirds in Arizona all winter _ 1 percent of theirpurchases could come back to fund their grandchildren's education,''O'Keefe said.</TEXT></DOC>
