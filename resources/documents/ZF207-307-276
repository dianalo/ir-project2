(801) 225-5000.andM;List Price: $549; upgrade from WordPerfect 5.0 for DOS, $75.andM;Requires: 2MB RAM for OS/2 1.0, 3MB RAM for OS/2 1.1andM;In Short: Despite a very minor loss of features, a complete and stable OS/2implementation of WordPerfect 5.0 is sure to be of great use to heavyWordPerfect users.andM;After months of waiting for the mainstream business applications that wouldmake OS/2 a useful alternative rather than an interesting possibility, thefirst word processor for OS/2 is here: WordPerfect for Operating System/2.andO;The powerful $549 program joins databases as another of the Big Fiveapplications that have made their way to OS/2 from DOS.andP;  Like other ports,WordPerfect for OS/2 retains so much of the look and feel of its DOScounterpart that it's difficult to tell them apart.andM;In fact, casual observers won't be able to distinguish between the DOS andOS/2 versions of the program when it is run in a full-screen session.andP;  Exceptfor such minor changes as &quot;Go to OS/2&quot; rather than shelling out to DOS, thetwo versions are visually the same.andP;  WordPerfect's installation program takescare of OS/2-specific differences in CONFIG.SYS file entries, such as whereDLLs are stored, what a LIBPATH is, and the inclusion of an IO-PL=YESstatement.andP;  The familiar WP.FIL file is now part of WP.EXE itself.andM;The look and feel haven't changed, but the 640K memory limitation has.andP;  Whenyou use the OS/2 version of WordPerfect, you won't have to count sheep whileyour system performs a labor-intensive mail-merge operation.andP;  You'll also beable to load a 400K file completely into memory.andP;  And although you can runthe DOS version of WordPerfect in the OS/2 Compatibility Box, you can runonly one copy of it at a time.andP;  Under OS/2, you can run multiple copies ofWordPerfect simultaneously and switch among them as needed.andP;  users of theprogram's graphics features will clearly benefit from being able to start upmultiple sessions of WordPerfect and switch rapidly among different designsand views, each of which might be printed.andP;  Of course, the benefits ofvirtual-memory accessibility and multitasking come from using OS/2, however,not from WordPerfect itself.andM;WordPerfect Corp. reports that it is possible to run up to 99 copies of theprogram.andP;  Although no user would ever want to do that, it's impossible toverify the company's claim, since OS/2 1.1 can run only a maximum of 16Presentation Manager text window sessions and a maximum of 12 full-screensessions.andM;In an attempt to make clear which copy of the program is running, WordPerfectfor OS/2 adds that information (in the form of WP1, WP2, and so forth) to thestatus line.andP;  If this feature were better implemented, it would be veryuseful.andP;  But as it stands, if you close the third copy of the program andstart another, the system reports that a fourth copy of WordPerfect has beenstarted.andP;  If all copies of the program have been closed, the counter is resetto 0.andP;  If only one copy is running, the status line does not display a WP1tag.andM;Although the best way to run WordPerfect for OS/2 is in full-screen sessions,you can view multiple copies of the program in Presentation Manager textwindows, which have some visual appeal.andP;  If you are going to start running areport and then switch to another copy f WordPerfect, text window operationis fine.andP;  However, a PM text window is not the place for real word-processingwork.andP;  First, the screen becomes very cluttered.andP;  Second, a PM text windowwill not support any of Version 5.0's graphics-previewing capabilities.andM;You can still import graphics images, but you cannot view them in previewmode, since a PM text window cannot go into graphics mode.andP;  Any attempt topreview a WordPerfect file with an imported graphics image in a PM textwindow will invoke the message &quot;Error: Invalid Graphics Driver.&quot;andP;  This errormessage is misleading and might cause a user to spend an awful lot of timetrying to find the nonexistent driver.andP;  The program should really report thatan illegal operation in a PM text window was attempted.andP;  In full-screensessions, however, all graphics features are fully supported, and previewmode displays graphics images perfectly.andP;  WordPerfect for OS/2 comes with asolid collection of printer drivers and was able to drive my HP LaserJetSeries II without a hitch.andM;Despite the similarities between WordPerfect for OS/2 and its DOScounterpart, the new version lacks some features that experienced users willmiss.andP;  For example, Repeat Performance (which provides cursor controlfeatures such as skid squelch and adjustable delay) and GRAB, as screencapture utility, are not available.andP;  If you're accustomed to seeing onscreenitalics, underlined fonts, and other similar embellishments, you will findthat the OS/2 version is lacking in this area as well, since OS/2 will notlet an application gain access to on-screen fonts.andP;  Instead, you will have torely on different foreground/background color combinations to indicateon-screen font changes.andM;As a character-based OS/2 application, WordPerfect for OS/2 is an interimproduct created to hold down the fort while the next release, which will runin the PM environment, is readied.andP;  That version, which is expected out inthe fourth quarter of this year, will probably be your best bet if you don'thave a pressing need for an OS/2-compatible word processor.andP;  In the meantime,a mere $75 will buy you the privilege of upgrading from the DOS to the OS/2version, bringing with it all the advantages that running applications underOS/2 has to offer.andP;  That said, I'm retiring the DOS version for good.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
