Angrist</HL><DATE>07/26/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A14</SO><LP>   Please measure your CI index right now. You may becourting disaster. In &quot;Outsmarting the Competition&quot;(Sourcebooks, 388 pages, $17.95), John McGonagle Jr. andCarolyn Vella say that if you aren't continually trying tofind out what your competition is doing, you are failing in&quot;competitive intelligence,&quot; or CI.   The authors define CI as &quot;the use of public sources todevelop information about the competition, competitors andmarket environment.&quot; Public information, they remind us, goesmuch beyond what you can find in this newspaper or what theU.S. Department of Commerce releases. It includes a documentreleased by a competitor as part of a lawsuit, as well as acompetitor's press release describing the marketing strategyfor a new product.</LP><TEXT>   If you can answer any of the five questions listed belowyou already are using some CI: Can I name five of my majorcompetitors? Can I name their major products or services?What will they be doing in the next six months? Who is doingmy job at each competing firm? What is he or she doing now?   The book gives several examples of how CI has paid off,citing for instance an alert CEO of an office-equipmentsupplier who learned in a conversation with a retailer that acompetitor had just raised prices on a product line. Heimmediately faxed this information to his sales force, whocapitalized on it within a day.   Without doubt the book's most useful attribute is its listof sources of public information, some of which are not soobvious: CompuServe, Investext, Mead Data Central, DialogInformation Services.   ---   Richard Pascale, a management consultant, argues in hisbook &quot;Managing on the Edge&quot; (Simon andamp; Schuster, 304 pages,$19.95) that an accurate indicator of managerial panic is theconsumption rate and shelf life of business fads. He saysmore than two dozen managerial techniques have waxed andwaned since the 1950s. The past five years have producedTheory Z, Matrix, Managerial Grid, T Groups,Interpreneurship, Demassing and One-Minute Managing.   He notes that many of these techniques contain validideas, but that they frequently are tried piecemeal and thenquickly abandoned. He quotes a marketing manager at anequipment manufacturer: &quot;In the past eighteen months, we haveheard that profit is more important than revenue, quality ismore important than profit, that people are more importantthan profit, that customers are more important than ourpeople . . . No wonder our performance is inconsistent.&quot;   Well, if you expected Mr. Pascale to tell us how to fixwhat ails American companies without coming up with anothermanagement technique then you truly are naive. His buzzwordanswer to our problems is a new mind-set, or paradigm. Itcontains four parts -- fit, split, contend and transcend.(Has Mr. Pascale been studying management with JesseJackson?)   So what does this paradigm mean in the real world ofmanagement? He illustrates it using Honda Motor Co., which hesays is perhaps the best managed company in the world. Hesays Honda has strong values and tightly disciplinedmanagementthat's fit. He says it is made up of proud andhighly independent companies that produce a single highlyintegrated automobile -- that's split. The company uses acontention-management system that facilitates rather thansuppresses conflict. Yet Honda's cultural fabric transcendsall this to handle the stress without tearing.   ---   Everyone has been treated rudely in a store, restaurant oron the phone with a company. Have you ever wondered why abusiness allows that to happen? Clay Carr, in his book&quot;Front-Line Customer Service&quot; (John Wiley, 280 pages,$24.95), explains how to fix such problems. He argues thatchanging the way employees interact with customers isgoverned by how much of a commitment management is willing tomake. Management shows its commitment by a willingness totrain employees and by adopting policies that say customersatisfaction is the company's only reason for being inbusiness.   But that's not why you should read this book. Mr. Carrdescribes several companies and their policies towardcustomers that make you want to do business with them. Hesays the single best description of total quality comes froma flier written by L.L. Bean in 1912: &quot;I do not consider thesale a success until the goods are worn out and the customerstill satisfied.&quot; He describes a large auto dealership inwhich the sales personnel are paid on a commission basis,with a bonus based on customer satisfaction. The outfit alsohas a quality-control coordinator, who has the power to spendas much as $500 per customer to satisfy complaints.   Word Perfect Corp., publisher of the popularword-processing program, receives more than 10,000 calls aday, every one of them free to the customer. The companybelieves this service is good for business: From 1980 to 1988its sales increased by almost 40,000%.   Orvis Co. sells fishing equipment by mail and did about$73 million in sales in 1988. The company has a simple policyon customer satisfaction: The customer is always right, nevermind proof to the contrary. Orvis once replaced a three-ouncefly rod for a customer who said he broke it while trying tokill a snake.   ---   Mr. Angrist writes about the commodities and optionsmarkets for the Journal.</TEXT></DOC>
