The CDC's action on AIDS is largely symbolic, however, becausethe list still would include infection with the humanimmunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS. That restrictionwas imposed by Congress.   The recommendation by the CDC to remove AIDS is seen as``signaling Congress that they should take HIV off'' the list aswell, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.   Along with AIDS, the CDC is recommending removing from the listall other contagious diseases except infectious tuberculosis, thesource said.   After a review of the diseases on the list, including syphilis,gonorrhea and leprosy, the CDC decided that only tuberculosis posedan important threat because it is highly contagious in its activestage.   While AIDS is also contagious, certain behavior _ such as sexualcontact or needle-sharing _ is required to transmit the virus.   Efforts are underway in Congress to give the administrationcomplete discretion as to what diseases to put on the list.However, an aide on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committeesaid ``it's still an open question'' whether an act of Congress isrequired.   The immigration regulations concerning AIDS have been protestedby AIDS activist groups, including the National Commission on AIDSand the World Health Organization.   Several groups, including the National Association of Peoplewith AIDS, have said they will boycott two major AIDS conferencesin the United States this year unless the restrictions are changed.   Dr. James Mason, assistant secretary for health at theDepartment of Health and Human Services, asked the CDC to reviewthe diseases on the immigration-restriction list and recommendchanges. The list had not been reviewed since 1977.   After consulting with outside medical experts, the CDCrecommended that all but tuberculosis be dropped from the list. IfMason approves the recommendation, the change would be published inthe Federal Register before taking effect.</TEXT></DOC>
