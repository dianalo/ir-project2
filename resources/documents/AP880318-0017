Two bombs fell in Nicaragua and a third landed across the CocoRiver in Honduran territory, Sandinista officers said. There was nodamage or injuries.   The raid came a day after Honduras accused Nicaragua of sendingthousands of soldiers across the border in pursuit ofU.S.-supported Contra rebels.   A Honduran armed forces spokesman in Tegucigalpa, the Hondurancapital, said the bombs were aimed at Sandinista forces thatcrossed into the neighboring country. He denied the planes enteredNicaraguan airspace.   More than 3,000 American soldiers began arriving in Honduras ina show of support Thursday. Ortega declared his army ready to``combat and liquidate'' the Americans and said his soldiers willnot withdraw from the border region.   Nicaragua has committed an estimated 6,000 soldiers to ananti-rebel operation in an area running from the central region tothe border, with most at the frontier.   About 25 reporters, most of them Americans, watched as the jetsroared into Nicaragua at about noon Thursday. The journalists divedfor cover but were not hurt as the bombs exploded as close as 70yards away.   The leftist Sandinista government flew the journalists to theregion for a briefing on its offensive against the U.S.-supportedContra rebels.   None of the five Soviet-made helicopters used in the area formovement of troops or evacuation were hit by the bombs. InWashington, sources who spoke on condition of anonymity claimedthat one Soviet-made helicopter on the ground had been damaged. TheSoviet Union supplies the Sandinistas with military hardware andtraining.   The Sandinistas opened fire at the planes with anti-aircraftguns but apparently did not hit either of them.   Some military officials in Nicaragua described the planes asFrench-made Mysteres, while others said they were U.S.-made F-5s.The Honduran air force has both.   A U.S. official in Washington said two U.S.-built F-5s and fourSuper-Mystere attack jets of the Honduran air force carried out theraid.   ``This was totally a Honduran operation,'' the official said,speaking on condition of anonymity.   Upon hearing of the raid, Ortega abruptly left a meeting withopposition politicians called to discuss their differences with thegovernment. A presidential source, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said Ortega held an urgent meeting with his militarychiefs.   Later, Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto said he had sent adiplomatic note to Secretary of State George P. Shultz ``formallyand energetically protesting'' the attack, which he blamed on theUnited States.   The government Voice of Nicaragua radio also said Thursday thatunidentified planes from Honduras buzzed Corinto, Nicaragua's mainport, and anti-aircraft batteries fired on them.   The broadcast gave no details. Corinto is on the Pacific, about70 miles northwest of Managua.   Honduras has one of Central America's smallest armies and relieson air superiority for defense. It and Mexico are the only nationsin the region with jet fighters.   Ortega called the dispatch of U.S. troops to Honduras ``one moreescalation of the war against Nicaragua.'' At Nicaragua's request,the U.N. Security Council will meet in urgent session Friday on theNicaraguan-Honduran border crisis and on the dispatch of U.S.troops to Honduras.   In Managua, Ortega said: ``We logically are going to maintainour offensive. ... We are not going to withdraw our troops now thatwe have recovered our territory.   ``We are ready to combat and liquidate the famous forces of the82nd Airborne Division.''   Earlier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Nicaragua already hadbegun withdrawing troops from the border region after driving about2,000 Contra rebels back into Honduras.   ``The operations have succesfully been concluded, and we don'tplan to stay along the border region,'' the spokesman, AlejandroBendana, said on NBC's ``Today'' show.   The 3,200 U.S. soldiers who began arriving in Honduras onThursday include two battalions from the 82nd Airborne at FortBragg, N.C.   Ortega accused the United States of pressuring Honduras intoasking for the American presence.   The C-141 planes carrying the U.S. troops were arriving every 30minutes at Palmerola air force base, the main center of U.S.military operations in Honduras. The base is about 125 miles westof the border, where heavy fighting was reported Wednesday.   Bendana denied U.S. and Honduran allegations that Sandinistatroops entered Honduras. Ortega himself wouldn't say if Sandinistatroops crossed the border.   But Honduran military officials, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said about 4,000 Honduran soldiers were surroundingabout 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers Thursday. The sources said theentire Honduran military was on alert.   Ortega told reporters the Nicaraguan ``invasion only exists inthe warped imagination of the North American leaders.''   ``We demand that the United States withdraw its troops fromHonduras immediately and, with this, contribute to the meeting thatis going to be held in Sapoa March 21 having positive results,'' hesaid.   Government and Contra representatives are scheduled to beginthree days of peace talks Monday in Sapoa, a town in southernNicaragua near the border with Costa Rica.   Ortega said the United States would use the current situation togive the Contras logistical and military aid not approved byCongress.   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar called forrestraint in the conflict but had not decided whether to send in anobserver team.</TEXT></DOC>
