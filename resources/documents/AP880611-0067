Police said 26 students forced their way past guards at the hugeCombined Central Government Complex in the center of Seoul, whichhouses the prime minister's office, the foreign ministry and othermajor government offices.   Students smashed windows and damaged a police post and a waitingroom in the complex with firebombs, police said. The complex isacross a main road from the U.S. Embassy.   Eight attackers barricaded themselves in a third-floor cafeteriain one building and hurled firebombs at riot police before beingseized.   No injuries were reported. Police said 18 students were arrested.   ``Punish the Roh Tae-woo government!'' and ``Fight forunification!'' the attackers screamed.   The students have accused President Roh Tae-woo of repressiveand undemocratic tactics aimed at keeping South Korea separate fromthe communist North and allied with the United States.   The students launched the raid after the government on Fridayblocked their plans to march to the North Korean border for talkswith northern student delegates on reuniting the Korean Peninsula.   North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency said studentsrallied Saturday in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, todenounce the suppression of the march. The report, monitored inTokyo, gave no attendance figures.   It said Ko Ung Sam, head of the North's student delegation tothe planned border talks, vowed to continue a ``persistentstruggle'' for the meeting.   South Korean riot police firing tear gas battled studentshurling firebombs and rocks in fierce street clashes Friday afterthe government blocked radicals' attempts to march the 30 miles tothe border.   Police said Saturday that more than 800 students were arrestedin the clashes and more than 100 police and students were injured.   Radical leaders at a rally Saturday at Yonsei University inSeoul vowed to mount another march to the North Korean border onAug. 15, the national independence day. They said they would notstop their struggle for reunification of the peninsula, dividedsince 1945.   ``Our struggle has ignited the mind of the people who wantreunification of our land,'' one leader said in a speech.   About 2,000 students applauded the speakers and shouted slogans.But the students' mood was subdued, and thousands of others who hadgathered at the campus for the march Friday left during the night.   Speakers continued to denounce the United States and demand thewithdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea under amutual defense pact.   ``Yankee go home!'' and ``Reunification!'' they chanted.   Radicals claim the United States enforces partition of theKorean Peninsula so it can rule the South. A wave of violentanti-American protests has hit South Korea during the past month.   Small clashes denouncing the blocking of the march were reportedin the provincial cities of Taeju and Kwangju. Riot police firingvolleys of tear gas dispersed students hurling rocks and firebombs.   The hard-core radicals _ who are often joined in protests bymore moderate sympathizers _ represent no more than about 10percent of South Korean college students and have failed to attractwide popular support with their reunification campaign.   Most South Koreans fear the totalitarian North is determined toconquer the South. North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to startthe Korean War and the two nations remain bitter enemies.   Roh, who took office Feb. 25 after elections in December, hasliberalized debate on unification but said the government, notstudents, should lead any dialogue with North Korea.   A funeral was planned Sunday in Seoul for a radical student whodied June 6 after setting himself on fire in a ritual protest.Three students have killed themselves in protests since May 15. InSouth Korea, dissidents sometimes use suicide as a way to callattention to their demands.</TEXT></DOC>
