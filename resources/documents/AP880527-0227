Gorbachev at theirMoscow summit next week.   It was the first major U.S.-Soviet arms control accord ratifiedby the Senate since 1972.   Leading up to the ratification vote, the Senate rejected fourminor amendments offered by Republicans. That brought to 14 thenumber of amendments proposed by GOP conservatives and rejectedduring two weeks of floor consideration of the treaty.   The Senate's consent to ratification, which required a two-thirdmajority, had long been assured because only a handful ofconservatives opposed the pact.   Senators voting against the treaty were Republicans Jesse Helmsof North Carolina, Steve Symms of Idaho, Gordon Humphrey of NewHampshire and Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and Democrat ErnestHollings of South Carolina.   Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del., and John Glenn, D-Ohio, did not vote.   Spectators crowded into galleries overlooking the Senate floorgave a standing ovation after the vote tally was announced.   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and GOP Leader BobDole, R-Kan., quickly informed Reagan of the outcome in a telephonecall to Helsinki, Finland, where the president was resting inadvance of the summit.   The two leaders accepted Reagan's invitation to come to Moscownext Tuesday to witness the exchange of treaty documents. The WhiteHouse said presidential chief of staff Howard Baker would fly toMoscow to deliver the U.S. ratification materials Sunday.   In a statement issued by the White House, the president said hewas ``very pleased'' by the vote, which ``clearly shows support forour arms reduction objectives.''   He added, however: ``I continue to have concerns about theconstitutionality of some provisions of the resolution ofratification, particularly those dealing with interpretation, and Iwill communicate with the Senate on these matters in due course.''   Byrd told Reagan, ``Bless your heart. We're just delighted thatwe're going to send you a treaty and it was almost a unanimous vote... we'll have a little blue ribbon tied around it.''   Dole told the president, ``We are very pleased to be able togive you this (ratification) in advance of your stepping on Sovietterritory in Moscow.''   Reagan and Gorbachev signed the pact Dec. 8 at their summitmeeting in Washington, and the administration had pushed for Senateaction before the Moscow summit.   Administration officials also waged a successful fight to winSenate approval without so-called ``killer amendments'' that wouldhave required U.S.-Soviet negotiations to be reopened.   Conservative Republican critics mounted several attacks, but alltheir attempts were easily turned back.   The only major change was a Democratic-backed amendment to theratification resolution, barring future administrations fromchanging the U.S. interpretation of the treaty without prior Senateapproval. That arose from a fight with Reagan over theAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the last arms pact to win Senateratification.   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INF treaty provides forthe elimination within three years of all medium-range missileswith a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles. The Soviets would destroy1,752 missiles while the United States would eliminate 867,including both deployed and non-deployed weapons.   The INF pact is the first in the 40-year history of U.S.-Sovietnuclear arms control to require the actual destruction of weapons.Other accords simply slowed the buildup of each side's vast nucleararsenals.   In addition, the treaty includes the most intrusive andstringent verification procedures in arms control history. The keyverification feature provides on-site inspection, both on a regularbasis and through challenges by each side.   Elimination of the medium-range missiles still will leavethousands of nuclear weapons in Europe. The United States has about4,300 short-range atomic weapons of various kinds in WesternEurope, while Great Britain and France have their own nucleararsenals.   While the pact will only provide for reductions of about 3percent in each side's arsenal, administration and congressionalsupporters say they hope it will be a blueprint for a morefar-reaching treaty reducing long-range weapons.   That proposed pact, known as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty(START), is the subject of ongoing U.S.-Soviet negotiations and islikely to be a key topic at the Reagan-Gorbachev summit.   Both sides are still far apart on the proposed START treaty, andone of the main sticking point is how to verify it. On-siteinspections would have to be even more far-reaching than those inthe INF Treaty.   In addition to serving as a first major step to START, the INFTreaty should also prod the 16-member North Atlantic TreatyOrganization to improve its array of conventional weapons,supporters argued during the congressional debate.   ``INF is a beginning, not an end,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,chairman of the Armed Services Committee.   Nunn was referring to NATO's need to improve its conventionaldefenses. The Soviets and their Warsaw Pact allies outnumber NATOin a variety of numerical categories of weapons, including tanksand artillery pieces.   The INF pact was hailed as ``NATO's finest hour'' by Secretaryof State George P. Shultz, a theme restated often during Senateconsideration of the accord.   Shultz was referring to NATO's decision to go ahead with the1983 deployments of the new U.S. nuclear weapons, despite strongprotests in some NATO nations, particularly Britain and WestGermany. Those deployments were considered the key to the finalagreement.</TEXT></DOC>
