(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Vice President Spiro Agnewcannot take a deduction on his California income tax returns forrepaying Maryland for bribes he alleged accepted, a state taxappeals board has ruled.   Agnew, for the past decade a resident of the affluent PalmSprings suburb of Rancho Mirage, has already paid the disputedstate taxes, but filed an appeal seeking a $24,197 refund based ondisapproved deductions for $268,462 in court-ordered restitution,fines and interest.   The California Franchise Tax Board denied those deductions fromAgnew's 1982 state income tax return in a 1986 audit. Agnew'sappeal of that decision was denied Thursday on a unanimous 5-0 voteof the state Board of Equalization.   ``If we allow this deduction and give Mr. Agnew the refund, weare in effect asking other California taxpayers to subsidize Mr.Agnew's wrongdoing,'' said board member Conway Collis.   Agnew still may appeal for a re-hearing or challenge the board'sdecision in court.   The U.S. attorney's office in Baltimore alleged that Agnewreceived $147,500 in illegal cash kickbacks from Maryland highwaycontractors for awarding them road contracts beginning in 1963 whenhe was Baltimore County executive and continuing while he wasgovernor and vice president.   On Oct. 10, 1973, Agnew pleaded no contest to a single count ofevading federal income taxes on the kickbacks. The plea bargain, inwhich Agnew did not admit taking bribes, netted him a three-yearsuspended prison term and a $10,000 fine. He also resigned as vicepresident.   Agnew was ordered to pay back taxes, penalties and interest in1974 on the alleged illicit income: $148,000 to the federalgovernment and $14,105 to Maryland.   Seven years later, as a result of a civil suit, Agnew maderestitution to the state of Maryland for the alleged bribes, whichwith interest totaled $268,482.   He contended that amounted to giving back income on which he hadalready paid taxes. By then a California resident, he deducted theentire amount plus $11,322 in legal fees from his 1982 Californiatax return, which showed more than $600,000 in income.</TEXT></DOC>
