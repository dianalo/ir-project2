(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Inmates follow Joyce Dixson everywhere,to the bathroom, to the dining hall, to her cell.   Her legal knowledge has her in such demand that she feels thereare too few hours in the day to get everything done _ even as sheserves life in prison without chance of parole. She's paying forher education dearly.   An attractive 38-year-old mother of two, she has spent the last14 years behind bars for shooting her pimp. Her own case seemshopeless, so she works for her fellow inmates.   But it was the sense of having been wrongly used that drove herto study law.   She has appealed several times, winning three times in theMichigan Court of Appeals on different issues. But the appeals wereoverturned in state and federal courts, and the U.S. Supreme Court,she says, refused to rule on it.   As a child in Saginaw, Mich., she would watch her future pass.   ``I used to sit on my porch when I was a little girl and watchhim go by with a Cadillac full of girls _ that was the exciting,glamorous life. The heroes of the neighborhood were those peoplewith money and big cars.   ``I graduated from high school and I had good jobs. I worked atGMAC, at the bank, at Kroger's. But as long as I was home in theneighborhood, whatever I got was never enough. My mother was onwelfare. I got caught up in his sweet talk, `I can show you abetter way.'   ``I was off and running and I didn't even know where I wasgoing. It's so easy to be manipulated when you want to believe whatyou hear.''   She worked for the pimp as a prostitute for three or four years.She didn't work the streets; he hooked her up directly with men heknew ``wanted a pretty woman to waste their money on.''   ``I could not take it anymore. It got to the point where I said,`Joyce, are you going to be a burned out whore and a dope fiend therest of your life or are you going to get out?' You have to make adecision. At the time that seemed like the only one to make.   ``I had been in his house for three days and I wanted to gohome. I was full of cocaine and he just kept feeding me morecocaine. I was paranoid and he wouldn't let me out. He had anotherwoman there. The cocaine told me I had to get out. He was talkingto a friend on the phone and I just shot him and left.''   Looking back, Dixson says, ``I knew somebody was going to shoothim some day. I'm just sorry it was me. People try to make it soundlike he was a poor, helpless man, and what I did was such ahorrendous thing. But I know I'm not that kind of person. For that20 to 30 seconds, they have completely judged me as a cold-bloodedmurderer and I'm not that.''   Dixson is much like other ``jailhouse lawyers.'' Their interestin law is sparked by hope of their own vindication, but they derivehope and meaning, and often a few bucks, from helping theircolleagues get released or have their sentences reduced.   By the time indigent inmates realize they've lost their right tocourt-appointed attorneys, they have nobody to turn to on appealbesides the people who have taken it upon themselves to learn law.   Many women inmates are involved in custody and divorce battles,and male prisoners more and more are seeking visitation rights withchildren on the outside.   ``A simple letter from the courts is so hard for some of them toread. A lot of them are embarrassed,'' says Anita Alcorta, anotherjailhouse lawyer in the Florence-Crane Women's Facility inColdwater. She learned English as a second language, as well as theintricacies of law.   Dixson says, ``I'm one of only three prisoners in the state tobe accepted at the University of Michigan. All that wouldn't havehappened if I had stayed out there.''   Yet trust in jailhouse lawyers can lead to disappointment andretaliation, says James Jourdan, 43, who is serving eight years inthe State Prison of Southern Michigan for shoplifting.   ``Ninety-five percent of the jailhouse lawyers are not by anystretch of the imagination competent to represent someone. A lot ofpeople are pretending to know the law to take from the lessfortunate,'' says Jourdan, who claims to have about 40 casespending before courts.   ``Some have been stabbed for not representing other prisonerstoo well. Here, the remedy is quick justice.''   About 59 percent of the 2,666 cases filed in the MichiganSupreme Court last year were criminal cases, and about half ofthose were filed without an attorney, says Corbin Davis, clerk ofthe high court.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
