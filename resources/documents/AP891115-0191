The provision generally would apply to all branches ofgovernment except the Senate, which is expected to consider aseparate version for itself before Congress adjourns forThanksgiving.</TEXT><BYLINE>PAY</BYLINE><TEXT>   The plan envisions top government pay scales increasing at least35 percent in the next 13{ months.   House members, federal judges and top executive branch officialswould receive an initial 7.9 percent pay raise by Jan. 1, a ``catchup'' for two years without a cost-of-living adjustment or COLA.   On Jan. 1, 1991, the same officials would receive a 25 percentincrease in pay, on top of whatever government-wide COLA takeseffect at that time. At a minimum, assuming no COLA in 1991, thesalary of rank-and-file House members would go to $120,700.Assuming a COLA of about 3 percent, salaries would be about$124,400 _ 39 percent above current levels.   After that, annual pay adjustments of up to 5 percent would bemade automatically based on the government's index ofprivate-sector wages and salaries.   The package would abolish the current federal pay commissionwhich recommends top government salaries and replace it with a new11-member Citizens Commission.</TEXT><BYLINE>OUTSIDE INCOME</BYLINE><TEXT>   House members, officers and employees, and other top executiveand judicial officials would be barred from accepting honoraria, orspeaking fees, beginning in 1991. For House members, current ruleslimit such fees to 30 percent of salary; for 1990, totalpermissible outside income for House members would be frozen at the1989 level.   Once the ban takes effect, payments for speeches which may begiven to charity would have to be made directly to the charity andcould not exceed $2,000, and could not go to any charity from whichthe official or a relative receives a financial benefit. However,the House would not make public the name of the charity, as it doesnow; only the name of the donor.   Income earned outside the House by members and top staff wouldbe limited to 15 percent of congressional salary beginning in 1991.Officials could not receive directors fees, legal fees or otherincome for professional services. Book royalties would be exemptfrom the limits, but only if they are from established publishersand are ``usual and customary.''   Both the limit on outside income and the honoraria ban would belifted if the pay raise is repealed.</TEXT><BYLINE>GIFTS AND TRAVEL</BYLINE><TEXT>   Members and staff could not receive gifts from any person,outside of family, totaling more than $200 a year beginning Jan. 1,1990. Most meals and gifts under $75 would not be counted in thetotal. Currently, members are barred from receiving more than $100a year in gifts from anyone with a ``direct interest inlegislation.'' Privately paid speaking trips would be limited tofour days for domestic travel and seven days for foreign travel.</TEXT><BYLINE>ETHICS COMMITTEE</BYLINE><TEXT>   The bipartisan House panel would be expanded from 12 to 14members and would separate its investigative and trial functions.If a House member is being investigated, the panel would divideinto two groups. One would serve in effect as a grand jury and theother as the trial jury.</TEXT><BYLINE>EXCESS CAMPAIGN FUNDS</BYLINE><TEXT>   House members who were in office in 1980 and now are allowed tokeep leftover campaign contributions when they retire would seethat privilege abolished in 1993.</TEXT><BYLINE>FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE</BYLINE><TEXT>   More detail would be required in the reporting of privatelyfunded travel for lawmakers, and new categories of value would becreated on the upper end of the scale for reporting of assets,liabilities and transactions. Currently, members can report theirmost valuable assets in the category of ``$250,000 and above.''Three new categories would be created for amounts up to $1 million.The value of assets in blind trusts would have to be reported forthe first time, and tighter restrictions would be placed on who canbe trustee.</TEXT></DOC>
