Except for Thursday's surprise announcement that Japan would join in altering interest rates to help stem the dollar's decline, the two days of conferences with President Reagan and other top U.S. officials produced little that was substantively new to deal with their countries' economic and trade problems.    As expected, the two leaders reaffirmed commitments by their finance ministers last April 8 to cooperate in trying to stabilize exchange rates. And Mr. Nakasone reiterated his earlier pledge to push for a new $34.5 billion economic stimulus package to help spur domestic demand so Japan can absorb more exports and thus relieve global trade imbalances.    But the Japanese prime minister failed to provide any new details about his economic program. And the two sides made only scant progress in resolving their dispute over trade in semiconductors and other issues outstanding.    The dearth of new initiatives disappointed some foreign-exchange traders, who had hoped for more breakthroughs. Despite news that the U.S. and Japan were revamping their interest rates, the dollar declined on the exchange markets late Friday, and some traders predicted it would slide further this week as well.    Nevertheless, both U.S. and Japanese analysts said Mr. Nakasone may have scored some political points. Lawmakers who met privately with the Japanese leader were impressed by his straightforward and knowledgeable responses to complaints they voiced about specific trade disputes.    Mr. Nakasone's cool performance -- even in the face of House approval on Thursday of the controversial trade bill -- made the prime minister seem undaunted in confronting the U.S. challenge headon.    &quot;Even though he didn't win the assurances he wanted on specific trade disputes, he portrayed himself as an international leader and helped underscore the dangers of an escalating trade war,&quot; said Yoichi Funabashi, a political analyst at the Washington-based Institute for International Economics. As such, Mr. Funabashi says, &quot;he at least has made some progress&quot; in defusing trade tensions between the two countries.    Japanese analysts said Mr. Nakasone's biggest disappointment was his failure to persuade President Reagan to lift the 100% tariffs he imposed last April 17 on certain Japanese electronic consumer goods in retaliation for Japan's apparent violations of a bilateral accord on semiconductor trade.    U.S. officials said they were sympathetic to the Japanese leader's concerns, but wouldn't be able to rescind the sanctions until they had hard evidence that Japanese microchip-makers have stopped &quot;dumping&quot; -- that is, selling their products at below the cost of production or fair-market value at home -- in third-country markets. Washington also wants U.S. chip makers to have wider access to Japan's home market.    The two sides made plans to have lower-level officials meet again in mid-May to review April sales figures to see whether Japan is complying, but U.S. officials said it's unlikely the U.S. will lift its tariffs before mid-June, even if the statistics showed that Japan is now complying with the semiconductor accord. Washington wants to be sure that any change in Japanese trading practices is likely to be long-lived.    Mr. Nakasone brought little that was new to mollify the U.S. concerning other trade issues. He reiterated a previous pledge to discuss the possible reduction of some agricultural trade barriers as part of the new global trade-liberalization talks now under way.    He also repeated earlier promises to give U.S. companies ample opportunity to bid on projects involved in the construction of the Kansai international airport near Osaka. He sidestepped questions about the possibility that Japan may produce a new fighter plane by itself, rather than join in co-production with the U.S.    He also reiterated previous announcements that the Japanese government will begin buying some U.S.-made supercomputers. Until recently, Tokyo had flatly refused to consider such a move.    Some U.S. officials expressed disappointment that Mr. Nakasone hadn't &quot;brought more with him&quot; to help the administration defuse anti-Japanese pressures in Congress.    The two leaders will meet again at the annual seven-nation economic summit conference, to be held in Venice this year from June 8 to 10. </TEXT></DOC>
