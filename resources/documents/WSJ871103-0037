Terms weren't announced, but persons familiar with the transaction said the purchase price was nominal.    A PaineWebber spokeswoman said the decision to shed the unit reflects the securities firm's decision to focus on areas with &quot;higher levels of profitability.&quot; As previously reported, in a recent wave of belt-tightening, Wall Street firms have been trimming low-margin operations such as commercial paper and municipal finance.    Asked why Citicorp wants a larger role in a business that Wall Street is disdaining, Alan S. MacDonald, head of Citicorp's North American investment bank, said the bank already has the staff and investor network to handle added commercial paper volume without significant added costs.    &quot;The origination sales force is there, and there will be no incremental costs in trading and sales,&quot; Mr. MacDonald said. &quot;We have the whole infrastructure there for that purpose.&quot;    Mr. MacDonald said he sees no problem in that Citicorp must place commercial paper directly with investors, and by law cannot underwrite it, as PaineWebber could. &quot;Commercial paper has developed into an agency business anyway,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
