Energy prices were up sharply as well, reflecting the steepestrise in gasoline prices since August.   The overall gain, only marginally better than March's 0.5percent gain, meant that for the first four months of 1988 retailprices were up at an annual rate of 4.5 percent.   While this was little changed from the 4.4 percent for all of1987, economists were concerned because much of the inflationarypressure has shown up in the last two months.   Analysts noted that the March rise had been the most severesince January 1987. Last month's 0.4 percent overall gain wasequivalent to an annual inflation rate of 5.3 percent.   ``The general message in this report is that prices have beenrising in the past two months at a faster pace and they willcontinue to do so,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist withMerrill Lynch. ``The fears that people have had about higherinflation are justified.''   Steinberg said that the underlying inflation rate is nowsomewhere around 5 percent, about 1 percentage point higher than ithas been for the last year.   The stock market, which had fallen sharply on Tuesday andWednesday because of worries about inflation and interest rates,took today's report in stride, with the Dow Jones industrialaverage edging up slightly in early trading.   Analysts said the overall gain did not prompt a new sell-offbecause the report was in line with expectations. But theycautioned that financial markets remain edgy about the buildinginflationary pressures.   More than one-fourth of the April gain in consumer prices camefrom a steep 2.0 percent jump in clothing costs, tying March forthe greatest one-month gain since price records were first kept in1947.   As was the case with March, analysts said the more expensiveclothing was chiefly the result of higher priced women's clothinglines.   Grocery store prices rose 0.8 percent in April, the biggestadvance since August 1986. Leading the way were sharply higherprices for beef (up 2.3 percent), fish (up 2.9 percent), and fruitsand vegetables (up 1.4 percent).   Gasoline prices climbed 1.1 percent last month after a 0.4percent March rise. Last month's jump was the steepest since a 3.3percent rise in August. After that, gasoline prices had fallen forsix straight months.   The gasoline price increases over the last two months largelyreflected concern that the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries would agree with non-member nations to limit production.   But those talks ended in failure and world oil prices have sincefallen substantially, leading analysts to believe that retailprices will soon turn downward.   The department gave these other specifics on April retail priceactivity:   _The record gain in clothing costs reflected an average 3.5percent gain in the prices of women's apparel, a 2.7 percent risein the prices for children's goods and a 2.1 percent jump in men'sclothing costs.   _New car prices were unchanged while automobile financing costsfell by 1.1 percent.   _Public transportation expenses, reflecting a jump in airlinefares, rose 0.8 percent.   _Home heating oil prices rose 0.9 percent, while natural gas andelectricity costs rose 0.4 percent.   The April increase left the overall index at 117.1, meaning thata hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 during a 1982-84base period would have cost $117.10 last month. Unlike the otherfigures in the report, the overall index is not adjusted forseasonal fluctuations.   Fears of inflation have stirred up financial markets in recentdays and economists.   Stocks barely broke a two-day losing streak Thursday afterworries about inflation and rising interest rates pushed the DowJones industrial average down sharply Tuesday and Wednesday.   Investors have viewed with some alarm a string of seemingly goodeconomic reports in recent weeks. Unemployment in April fell to a14-year-low of 5.4 percent while the factory operating rate climbedto an eight-year-high of 82.7 percent.   While evidence of better-than-expected economic activity, thereports also   raised fears in financial markets that the economy is growingtoo strongly and soon tight labor markets and high factoryoperating rates will translate into higher wages and rising prices.   The Reagan administration maintained that the concerns aboutinflation have been overblown. Treasury Secretary James A. BakerIII told reporters Thursday that the administration saw no reasonto change its forecast that consumer prices would rise by 4.3percent this year. In 1987, consumer prices climbed 4.4 percent.   Private economists are in general agreement with theadministration's forecast, contending that the inflation worriesexhibited by the market would subside once the impact of a spike inoil prices abates.   ``The markets discovered inflation and now they are overdoingit,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecastingproject at Georgia State University. ``Inflation is going to rise,but I don't see it going above 5 percent even next year.''   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said hewas not looking for inflation to get above 4.5 percent this yearbecause of the actions already taken by the Federal Reserve.   Twice in the past two months, the Fed has tightened up on creditconditions and pushed interest rates higher in an effort to dampeneconomic demand.   ``The Fed has tightened and it will tighten more and that willkeep inflation in check,'' Evans predicted.</TEXT></DOC>
