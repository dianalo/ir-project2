Lambert of any wrongdoing in the judge's effort to get the prominent corporate law firm Sullivan andamp; Cromwell reinstated to a case, sources familiar with the matter said.    As previously reported, Sullivan andamp; Cromwell in June was accused by a state appeals panel of using &quot;stealth&quot; and &quot;deceit&quot; to obtain from another law firm secret files in a trust case before Judge Lambert. In an unusual move, the appeals court removed Sullivan andamp; Cromwell from the case.    The State Commission on Judicial Conduct later began an inquiry after Judge Lambert acknowledged, in an interview with this newspaper, that she &quot;informally approached&quot; an appeals judge about getting Sullivan andamp; Cromwell reinstated long enough to settle the case. The judge said she was only trying to resolve a case the law firm had handled improperly.    The judicial code of ethics makes it improper for lower court judges to intercede on behalf of any litigant before a higher court.    Judge Lambert declined to comment Friday, but other sources confirmed that she received a letter stating there was &quot;no basis&quot; for pursuing the matter.    Gerald Stern, the judicial commission's administrator, wouldn't confirm any of these developments because, he said, the commission can't &quot;in any respect&quot; comment on its inquiries. The commission has at any time more than 100 such judicial inquiries pending statewide, including some spurred by newspaper articles, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
