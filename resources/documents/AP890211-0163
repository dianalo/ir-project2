The 13 political parties, however, did not agree to the rebeldemand that the elections be postponed from March 19 to September.   The guerrillas' proposal to participate in the elections was madeon Jan. 24. Their demand that the balloting be delayed was stronglyopposed by President Jose Napoleon Duarte and the armed forces.   Aronette Diaz, leader of the leftist Democratic NationalistUnion, told a news conference that the political parties agreed thatthe guerrilla proposal contains positive elements but that ``doubtsand questions'' about the offer would be expressed to guerrillaleaders.   Mrs. Diaz said the parties agreed to send their questions aboutthe proposal to the guerrillas on Monday. Three days after the rebelresponse is received, she said, the parties will invite a delegationof commanders ``to hold direct conversations in a mutually agreedupon place.''   Two guerrilla commanders had offered Thursday to travel to SanSalvador to initiate face-to-face talks on the proposal with partyand government representatives.   The guerrilla offer to participate in elections was a drasticshift. The Marxist-led rebels waging a 9-year-old war against theU.S.-backed government have boycotted the five national electionsheld this decade.   The rebels contend elections are part of a U.S.-imposedcounterinsurgency project to put a civilian facade on amilitary-dominated government.   Meanwhile, in Costa Rica, two Salvadoran rebel commanders metwith Costa Rican President Oscar Arias to seek his support on theirproposal when he meets with fellow Central American leadersbeginning on Monday.   Jose Mario Lopez and Mercedes del Carmen Letona told a newsconference in the Costa Rican capital of San Jose that they alsosent letters to presidents Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala and JoseAzcona Hoyos de Honduras, seeking their support for the proposal.   Arias, Cerezo, Azcona and Duarte, along with Nicaraguan PresidentDaniel Ortega, are scheduled to meet in El Salvador Monday andTuesday.   The presidents are to discuss a stalled peace plan they signed inGuatemala in 1987 which calls for political amnesties and an end tocivil wars in the region.   The foreign ministers of the five nations on Wednesday asked theUnited Nations to send a multinational force of inspectors toCentral America to verify that no country supports subversionagainst their neighbors.</TEXT></DOC>
