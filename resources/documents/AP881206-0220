The prospect of crippling fines, a hostile judge, an impendingrackeetering indictment, enormous legal fees and a potential floodof civil lawsuits have combined to make Drexel rethink its position,they said Monday.   According to one of the sources, who all spoke on condition theynot be identified, a possible plea agreement or an indictment couldcome before Christmas, following final negotiations between Drexelattorneys and representatives of the Manhattan U.S. attorney'soffice.   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined comment on the firm'sstrategy. U.S. attorney's office officials also declined comment onthe Drexel case, in accordance with their policy of silenceregarding pending investigations.   A settlement of the biggest securities fraud investigationarising from the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal would mark astunning reversal for Drexel, the scrappy Wall Street powerhousethat vowed to triumph over accusations it conspired with Boesky,manipulated stock and cheated clients.   Even with the threat of major criminal charges hanging overhead,Drexel has continued to dominate in the lucrative business it almostsinglehandedly created, the $175 billion high-yield, high-risk``junk bond'' market.   That fact was dramatically illustrated last week when a buyoutteam backed by Drexel won a record bidding contest for RJR NabiscoInc. for nearly $25 billion. Drexel will earn tens of millions ofdollars in fees by helping place $5 billion in junk bonds crucial tofinancing that deal.   Nonetheless, Drexel's senior management seemed more preoccupiedwith the firm's legal troubles last week and suggested privately tothe staff in blunt terms that a settlement was possible and evenpreferable.   ``If we settle, we can put this constant attack on the firmbehind us,'' Drexel Chief Executive Frederick Joseph said in amemorandum to the firm's 10,000 employees, outlining how he saw theimmediate future possibly unfolding.   Joseph told employees that talks with U.S. Attorney Rudolph W.Giuliani ``are now reaching a crucial stage. If we do not agree tosettle with the U.S. attorney, we believe that he intends to indictthe firm (as well as certain of our employees) and to include insuch an indictment so-called racketeering charges (`RICO').''   Indictment under the federal Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations law, originally intended to combat drug pushers andpimps, would taint Drexel as an allegedly criminal enterprise, tieup much of the firm's assets and impair its ability to conductnormal business.   Conviction could bring crippling fines.   Moreover, a racketeering conviction would expose Drexel topotentially hundreds of private lawsuits by investors who claim theywere victimized, for which the firm would risk paying triple damages.   Even if Drexel believes it can beat the racketeering charges,attorneys familiar with the case said they think the firm isreassessing that approach because of the adverse publicity suchcharges would create.   Compounding Drexel's concern is the prospect that the governmentmay have found other witnesses to testify against the firm besidesBoesky, the notorious speculator who turned state's evidence aftersettling insider trading charges two years ago by paying a record$100 million in penalties.   Up until recently, Drexel lawyers had been saying confidentlythat the crux of the government's investigation hinged on the wordsof Boesky, a doublecrosser and admitted liar now serving athree-year federal prison term.   In addition, Drexel may fear the wrath of a federal judge likelyto play a major role in any criminal case, Milton Pollack, who hasbeen presiding over much of the Boesky-related civil litigation todate and is known for his pro-government leanings in white-collarfrauds.   Drexel has been fighting unsucessfully to have Pollackdisqualified from hearing the civil fraud case against the firmbrought by the Securities and Exchange Commission three months ago.So far, that effort seems only to have made the judge more hostileto Drexel's position.</TEXT></DOC>
