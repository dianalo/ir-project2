Conway Jr., senior vice president and chief financial officer, said.    Previously, the Washington-based telecommunications concern said it would take a pre-tax charge of between $500 million and $700 million for write-downs and restructuring.    Mr. Conway in an interview declined to comment on operating earnings for the fourth quarter. Analysts generally expect the company to report earnings of a few cents a share, before the charge and other unusual items.    Based on the preliminary after-tax figures supplied by Mr. Conway, the charge will result in sizable net losses for both the quarter and the year. In the first nine months of 1986, MCI had net income of $54.1 million, or 20 cents a share, on revenue of $2.67 billion.    For 1985, MCI posted profit of $113.3 million, or 48 cents a share, on revenue of $2.54 billion.    On a pre-tax basis, Mr. Conway said he expects the charge to consist of about $530 million in equipment write-downs and &quot;probably less than&quot; $75 million in restructuring costs, including severance pay for 2,300 employees who have been laid off. Mr. Conway said &quot;more than half&quot; of the asset write-down would be related to satellite communications equipment, including assets acquired in February when MCI bought Satellite Business Systems from International Business Machines Corp.    The fourth-quarter charge, Mr. Conway said, will be partially offset by gains from the company's antitrust settlement with the former Bell System and possibly a small gain from the sale of the California unit of its Air Signal cellular phone and paging business to closely held McCaw Communications Cos. of Bellevue, Wash.    Mr. Conway declined to comment on the size of the antitrust settlement, saying only that &quot;compared to the charge, (it will be) tough to find.&quot; He said the Air Signal gain -- reflecting the final proceeds from the sale of the unit, most of which was completed in the third quarter -- might be &quot;less than $5 million.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
