<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-01-0039 </DOCNO><TEXT>ARCO Solar has been pursuing the development of thin films as the nextgeneration of photovoltaics to substantially displace the present dominanttechnology based upon crystalline silicon. We have chosen two thin filmmaterials, namely, thin film Si:H or a-Si (TFS) and copper indium diselenide(CIS). These have band gaps of 1.7 and 1.0 eV, respectively, and offeropportunities as stand-alone devices with high voltage or high currentper unit area, respectively, as well as combined to form high efficiencytandems. In this paper a review of the development of these devices willbe presented. The discussion will begin with products that have beenintroduced and proceed through products presently being introduced topredictions of future product expectations and progress made toward thoseexpectations.</TEXT></DOC>
