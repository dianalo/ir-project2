However, an official of the Church of England, which organizedthe trip, said Friday that the four legislators would not conductformal negotiations for the release of the men, apparently held bypro-Iranian kidnappers.   During the four-day visit to the Iranian capital of Tehran,beginning Sunday, the legislators will meet high-ranking Iranianofficials.   The four lawmakers in the mission are Cyril Townsend and RobertHicks of the governing Conservative Party, Thomas Clarke of theLabor Party and Lord Tordoff of the Social Liberal Democrats.   Clarke said the invitation had come from Parliament speakerHashemi Rafsanjani.   Diplomatic ties between Britain and Iran were reduced tocaretaker status a year ago but showed signs of improving when thecountries agreed during talks in London last week to compensateeach other for damages to their diplomatic offices.   The Iranian Embassy building at London's Princes Gate caughtfire when British commandos stormed it in 1980 to end a hostagesiege. British diplomatic buildings and the British Embassy in Iranwere damaged by mobs in 1978, 1979, and 1980.      The British Foreign Office said the lawmakers' trip wasprivately organized. ``We have been informed but not consulted,''said an official there who spoke on condition of anonymity.   ``The group is not going to negotiate for the return ofhostages,'' said Eve Keatley, a spokeswoman for Archbishop ofCanterbury Robert Runcie, the spiritual leader of the Church ofEngland, also known as the Anglican Church.   ``It is a fact-finding mission to find ways to improve relationswith Iran which could lead to the freeing of Terry Waite and theother British hostages,'' she said.   Waite, 49, Runcie's personal envoy, disappeared in Beirut 17months ago while on his fifth mission to try to win the release ofWesterners abducted in Lebanon.   Most of the 18 missing foreigners are believed to be heldcaptive by the Hezbollah, or Party of God, an Iranian-backedmilitant Shiite Moslem faction.   Nine of the missing are Americans, including the longest-heldhostage, Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press. He was kidnapped in Beirut March 16, 1985.   Other Britons who were kidnapped are John McCarthy, 31, atelevision journalist abducted April 17, 1986, as he drove toBeirut Airport to fly home; and Alec Collett, 64, a New York-basedjournalist who disappeared March 25, 1985, while on assignment forthe U.N. Relief and Works Agency.   An Islamic extremist organization claimed Collett had beenkilled, but his body has not been found and there has been no proofthat he is dead.   Brian Keenan, 36, born in the British province of NorthernIreland but holding a Republic of Ireland passport, was abductedApril 11, 1986. He was walking at the time to the AmericanUniversity of Beirut, where he worked as an English teacher.   The mother and sisters of Keenan appealed Friday to thekidnappers to declare their demands for his release. The appeal,published in the An-Nahar newspaper said, ``We are poor people, butare willing to do everything we can to help Brian.''   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has stressed her determinationnot to pay ransom to the captors of Britons. Waite, who had helpedfree three American hostages in Lebanon, left instructionsforbidding any ransom payment if he was kidnapped.   Mrs. Keatley said the Anglican church has ``repeatedly made itclear we are not prepared to be party to any deal which wouldindicate in any way that hostage-taking pays dividends.''</TEXT></DOC>
