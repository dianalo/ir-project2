(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The newest generation of word processors display proportional fontson-screen, varying the length and width of each letter depending upon itsshape and size.andM;Traditional word processors display text on-screen by means of a single,non-proportional system font.andP;  As a result, printed output differssubstantially from the screen display.andM;With current proportional-font word processors, the screen display is areasonable facsimile of the printer output.andP;  Such packages, including NBIInc.'s Legend, Interleaf Publisher Inc.'s IBM Interleaf Publisher, SamnaCorp.'s Ami, Palantir Inc.'s WinText and WYSIWYG Corp.'s Universal Word,bring to DOS a graphical text-editing environment long familiar to Macintoshusers.andM;Each product provides what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editing and isaimed at a specific market.andM;Legend and Interleaf Publisher face off at the high end, bridging the gapbetween word processors and desktop-publishing software.andM;Ami and WinText fight for the attention of Microsoft Windows users.andO;Universal Word, with its proprietary user interface, caters to a multilingualaudience.andM;Corporate purchasers looking for integrated word processing and desktoppublishing should look past Interleaf to Legend.andP;  Both products, ported tothe PC from higher platforms, are packed with features.andP;  However, Legend hitsthe PC bull's-eye while Interleaf Publisher misses the mark.andM;The Interleaf Publisher look and feel is completely non-standard, forcingcorporate users to learn yet another graphical interface.andM;Legend, however, is a comfortable product.andP;  It has a solid Windowsimplementation and, unlike Interleaf Publisher, supports allWindows-compatible devices, including Hewlett-Packard printers.andM;To their credit, both Interface and Legend outperformed their lesssophisticated competitors in font-manipulation exercises.andP;  This is surprisingbecause simpler products, with reduced overhead, often outperform morecomplex products.andM;Narrowing the focus to generic proportional-font word processors, Ami is theclear winner.andM;WinText and Universal Word have fewer features than Ami, but both havesubstantially higher prices.andM;Unlike Ami, neither WinText nor Universal Word can snake text aroundgraphics.andP;  Also, neither product can import standard-format graphic files.andO;WinText will only import graphics from the Windows clipboard.andM;Universal Word, like Interleaf, has a non-standard graphical user interface.andO;Its list of low-powered features and its high price make it unattractive tothe average corporate customer.andM;However, multilingual users will still appreciate Universal Word.andM;None of these products provides macro capabilities, which is a standardfeature on such popular word processors as WordPerfect and Microsoft Word,and they all lack an on-line tutorial.andM;In the case of Interleaf Publisher and Universal Word, a tutorial would helpthe user learn the unfamiliar graphical interface.andM;All of these products were tested on a Compaq 386 Model 25 operating at25MHz, with 3M bytes of RAM and a 112M-byte hard disk.andM;Except for Interleaf and WYSIWYG Corp., all of the products support MicrosoftWindows.andM;----------Fast, but ComplexandM;INTERLEAF INC., IBM INTERLEAFandM;PUBLISHER, $995andM;Anyone looking for a one-stop, soup-to-nutsword-processing/graphics/desktop-publishing package should consider InterleafPublisher.andP;  The product, which requires a 386-based PC and 2M bytes of RAM,is a PC version of a high-end workstation product.andM;Considering its extensive capabilities, Interleaf Publisher is surprisinglyfast.andP;  It offers a complete range of word-processing capabilities includingsearch and replace, automatic indexing and table-of-contents creation, spellchecking, hyphenation and flexible auto-numbering.andM;Interleaf Publisher includes more than 40 user-selectable display fonts.andP;  Theintegration of text and graphics is impressive, even allowing &quot;minidocuments&quot;of text to exist within graphic elements, or &quot;frames.&quot;andM;Interleaf's ability to control text within graphic elements is good, andincludes support for multiple columns and other dynamic formatting.andP;  However,it's difficult to wrap text around non-rectangular frames.andM;Its biggest drawback is the non-standard graphical user interface itsupports.andP;  Users familiar with Microsoft Windows or Presentation Manager willhave to relearn everything but the most basic graphical-user-interfaceconcepts.andM;To make matters worse, at times the documentation is cryptic, and the packageoffers no on-line tutorial.andM;Unfortunately, the extra training it requires doesn't pay off, because theInterleaf Publisher environment is inferior even to Windows.andP;  Indications ofthe poor interface include missing help screens and menu choices thatdisappear when resizing a window.andM;In a similar fashion, Interleaf Publisher provides PostScript-compatibleoutput only, a characteristic that ignores the thousands of Hewlett-PackardCo. laser printers in use.andM;Interleaf Publisher offers a comprehensive solution to document management.andO;Unfortunately, it doesn't merit the attention of corporate word-processingcustomers until a more PC-oriented version is available.andM;Interleaf Inc., located in Cambridge, Mass., can be reached at (617)621-0800.andP;  For more information, contact IBM at (800) IBM-7257, ext.andP;  146.andM;Buyers say: It has many strengthsandM;&quot;It incorporates text and graphics in one package, so I don't have to do mytext in one and graphics in another and bring them together in a third,&quot; saida programmer at a gas and electricity supplier based in Denver.andM;She chose Interleaf Publisher over Aldus Corp.'s Pagemaker and Xerox VenturaPublisher.andP;  &quot;The fonts are really clear on the screen,&quot; she said.andM;&quot;[Interleaf's] Windows environment has many strengths,&quot; said Peter Richetta,manager of product support and computer-integrated design and manufacturingat Motorola Inc.'s Government Electronics Group, in Scottsdale, Ariz.andP;  &quot;It'svery fast and has many strengths.andP;  [It's] really well-thought-out.&quot;andM;Richetta uses Interleaf Publisher for in-house technical publishing, whichincludes the importing of engineering designs, schematics and two- orthree-dimensional drawings.andM;Version 3.5 required less RAM and disk space than previous releases, anenhancement which pleased Richetta.andM;Some of the firm's users complained because Interleaf Publisher doesn't rununder Windows.andP;  &quot;It's a problem, but not a show-stopper for us.andP;  They findthe product highly productive once they get used to it.&quot;andM;Closer to Desktop PublishingandM;NBI INC., LEGEND, $695andM;This word processor delivers true desktop-publishing capabilities and is byfar the most capable of the Windows-based word processors.andM;It comes with a well-implemented user interface and high-qualitydocumentation.andP;  However, the documentation is missing a tutorial.andM;Also, there is no support for importing encapsulated PostScript graphicsfiles.andP;  This wouldn't be important except that Legend primarily is adesktop-publishing package.andM;However, Legend does an excellent job of representing fonts on-screen, and itcommunicates well with Windows-compatible printers.andM;Legend provides such standard features as style sheets, search and replace,undo, spell checking and hyphenation.andP;  It also adds sophisticatedcapabilities, including table generation, location dependency betweendocument components, and automatic index generation.andM;Users can specify margins and line-spacing measurements in inches,centimeters, points or picas.andM;Legend performs automatic and user-controlled kerning.andP;  In addition, userscan define colors with precision, visually or numerically specifying hue,saturation and intensity.andM;In positioning text and graphics on a page, Legend easily and automaticallywraps around rectangular objects, although it has difficulty wrapping aroundnon-rectangular frames.andM;NBI Inc., located in Boulder, Colo., can be reached at (800) 624-1111.andM;Buyers say: Good, with powerandM;&quot;I like [Legend's] text-handling features [and] the way it moves thingsaround,&quot; said Christine Eckman, a design engineer for a majortelecommunications supplier in Denver.andP;  &quot;Most of all, I like the fact thatit's Windows-compatible.&quot;andM;Eckman has used Legend for six months to produce presentation and publisheddocuments.andM;Legend's proportional fonts are readable, she reported, and non-proportionalfonts are no less readable on her Enhanced Graphics Array (EGA) screen.andM;However, proportional spacing is &quot;a tiny bit slower&quot; than non-proportionalspacing, she said.andM;Although NBI's earlier releases of Legend were much slower, &quot;screen refreshand typing are much faster in the new version,&quot; she claimed.andP;  &quot;It'sacceptable now.&quot;andM;&quot;We use Legend to give us a lot more power and to save us a lot of money andtime&quot; in avoiding the need for professional printing services, said MarianneZawitz, a statistician for the Department of Justice's Bureau of JusticeStatistics in Washington.andM;Zawitz uses Legend because it's compatible with NBI's Oasis word processor,her office's standard.andM;Marie DiCocco, an information-systems analyst for the Arlington CountyGovernment in Arlington, Va., reported that Legend is &quot;a good package, fairlysimple to work through.&quot;andM;DiCocco considered the Windows interface intuitive but not necessarily easierto use than a non-Windows program.andM;&quot;Once you have a basic understanding of Windows and pull-down boxes, you canget through the system much easier,&quot; she said.andM;For Quick and Dirty JobsandM;PALANTIR INC., WINTEXT, $350andM;WinText is the word processor for quick and dirty jobs.andP;  Possibly the easiestto use of the Windows word processors, WinText has many useful capabilitiesbut lacks some important high-end word-processing features.andM;WinText supports flexible hyphenation, mail merge, sorting, automatic indexgeneration, and line and box drawing.andM;However, it lacks style-sheet capabilities, making it less useful forheavy-duty document creation.andM;There is no support for standard graphics-file formats, and text cannot bewrapped around graphic elements.andP;  The product also lacks a thesaurus.andM;The low-powered on-line help system is no more than four simple screens ofinformation done as a checklist.andP;  WinText's Help doesn't help users find whatthey want to know.andM;Using multiple fonts in WinText is as easy as pointing and clicking with amouse.andM;WinText's manual is clear and concise, but it lacks an on-line tutorial.andM;In sum, managers with little time to learn a comprehensive word processormight like WinText.andM;Palantir Inc., of Houston, can be reached at (713) 955-8787.andM;Buyers say: Great under WindowsandM;Bobby William, vice president and director of software development atMicroView Inc., a software developer in Houston, chose WinText because it wasa Windows application.andM;He found it easy to use and said, &quot;The output looks outstanding.&quot;andM;WinText's speed in changing and realigning fonts on-screen was a plus,according to William.andM;&quot;With Ami, you may wait years before the fonts change.andP;  On WinText it's notinstantaneous, but compared [to Ami] it's acceptable,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;I really like WinText's rulers,&quot; he continued.andP;  &quot;WinText automaticallychanges the document as rulers move.&quot; He was also pleased with the product'sability to line up tabular information.andM;&quot;It serves my purpose well.andP;  Everything is really simple to set up,&quot; saidJohn Fomby, a design engineer at Atec Inc., an aerospace-equipmentmanufacturer in Houston.andM;&quot;With a normal [non-proportional display] word processor, there's just toomuch I have to do, and it takes too long.andP;  I need to see [on-screen] howthings will look.andP;  I stay with proportional spacing because it's quick andeasy,&quot; Fomby added.andM;However, he said, he wished the product came with a built-in dictionary.andM;&quot;WinText makes it easy to line up columns.andP;  You can put a ruler anywhere youwant, and its very, very quick,&quot; said Richard Bermerdez, principal of MicroStrategics, a Houston software developer.andM;Bermerdez emphasized the product's ease of use.andP;  &quot;It's a really good wordprocessor.andP;  There's really no competition for it in Windows,&quot; he added.andM;Feature-Rich and Easy To UseandM;SAMNA CORP., AMI, $199andM;From installation to product support, Ami is a class act.andP;  Ami's realstrength is in its capability to easily put together a graphics-orienteddocument.andP;  Say good-bye to staying up all night getting a business proposaljust right.andM;Creating stunning output on Hewlett-Packard or PostScript printers isstraightforward with Ami, partly due to its support of all Windows-compatibledevices.andM;The product can be installed without difficulty, and proves itself easy touse through its Windows user interface and through such features asautomatically numbered lists.andM;Veterans of high-powered, traditional word processors like Microsoft Wordwill be surprised at how easy it is to use Ami's style sheets.andP;  However,although the style sheets provide ample control over documents andparagraphs, unlike Microsoft Word they can't control the formatting ofindividual characters or words within a paragraph.andM;Users can snake text around graphic elements, but Ami lacks extensivepositioning controls for elements, and it only wraps around rectangularelements.andM;A high-powered PC is required to run Ami.andP;  Without a 386 or fast 286 machine,Ami's performance is next to miserable with anything longer than a 10-pagedocument.andM;Ami comes with a well-implemented 130,000-word spelling checker and theability to read popular word-processing file formats.andM;However, it lacks a thesaurus.andM;The software enables users to import graphics from the Windows clipboard orfrom TIFF files, although it doesn't support all standard graphics fileformats.andM;Samna Corp., of Atlanta, can be reached at (800) 831-9679.andM;Buyers say: Easy, but limitedandM;Most Ami buyers said they use the package as a low-end desktop publisher, notstrictly as a word processor.andM;&quot;I think it's a fantastic product for the price,&quot; said John Baker, a systemsengineer at Industrial Automation Intercompany Organization, a division ofTexas Instruments Inc. in Dallas.andP;  He also described Ami as easy to learn.andM;&quot;[Ami performs] the basic features of a desktop publisher like Ventura and iseasy to understand&quot; because of its style sheets, he explained.andP;  &quot;It shows youwhat [a printed document] will really look like.&quot;andM;&quot;It has a lot of the functionality of PageMaker and Ventura without theassociated costs,&quot; said John Fischer, advanced technology analyst at HelixTechnology Corp., a manufacturer of cryogenics products in Waltham, Mass.andM;Fischer and his colleagues use Ami not as a word processor but as a &quot;low-endpaste-up package.andP;  It doesn't have the full functionality of a wordprocessor,&quot; Fischer said.andM;However, he found Ami easy to install: &quot;I can set a user up with Ami, and hecan be up and running usually within an hour or two.&quot;andM;Jim Divisio, consulting director at Computer Video Systems, acomputer-consulting firm in Irwindale, Calif., reported that Ami's display iseasy to read, but the program runs &quot;kind of slow.andP;  The slow speed and thefact that it only imports a PCX [paint-brush] graphics file is what bothersme,&quot; he said.andM;Divisio is awaiting the next release, Ami Professional, because Ami is &quot;stilla little too limited.andP;  Ami is great as a word processor that lets you workfonts on-screen, with simple graphics like bullets and boxes.andM;&quot;For the average person who just wants to put out a nice proposal now andthen, it's a nice package, but for someone who does a lot of large proposals,it's limited,&quot; he said.andM;Multilingual Word ProcessingandM;WYSIWYG CORP., UNIVERSAL WORD, $895andM;Universal Word is designed to offer sophisticated multilingual wordprocessing.andP;  It gives users Times Roman and Old English fonts, plus typefacesfor more than 50 languages, including German, Spanish, French, Russian, Greekand Japanese, as well as Arabic.andM;This easy-to-use product intelligently couples standard word-processingfeatures with a multilingual environment.andP;  For example, itssearch-and-replace function is sensitive to accents and forms in European andArabic languages.andM;An added bonus is the spelling checker, which is available for English andGerman (Spanish and French spelling checkers are forthcoming).andM;The product includes a thesaurus, and the $695 English-only version includesa dictionary.andM;The product supports many features popular in midrange word processors,including undo, non-breaking space, headers, footers and page numbering.andO;However, it lacks some high-end features, such as style sheets and indexgeneration.andM;Other drawbacks reduce the product's appeal.andP;  First, it is copy-protected,forcing the user to uninstall the product before erasing it from a hard disk.andO;Second, it does not support Microsoft Windows, forcing users to learnnon-standard interface conventions.andM;While most users are likely to avoid the high-priced Universal Word in itscurrent incarnation, those with multiple language needs will appreciate itscapabilities.andM;WYSIWYG Corp., of Los Angeles, can be reached at (213) 215-9645.andM;Buyers say: Very easy to useandM;&quot;I use proportional spacing for layouts.andP;  Mainly, I create a documenton-screen and try to make it fit,&quot; said Otman Barrani, a freelance graphicsdesigner in Torrance, Calif.andM;&quot;I don't really spend lots of time trying to figure out how to use it,&quot; headded.andP;  &quot;Universal Word is a very powerful word processor withdesktop-publishing features.andP;  It also has multiple windows.andP;  I can open manyfiles and cut, copy and paste between them.andP;  That is a very powerfulfeature.&quot;andM;&quot;I thought it was a bargain,&quot; said Douglas Wong, a project engineer atNorthrup Electronics Systems, an aerospace engineering company in Hawthorne,Calif., and a division of Northrup Corp.andM;&quot;All the other word processors have a spell checker.andP;  This one givesdefinitions,&quot; Wong said.andM;Wong was pleased with the product's proportional display.andP;  &quot;It's veryreadable.andP;  I play with [a New Century typeface], and nine-point type is aboutthe smallest I can get on my screen,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I once created a document innine-point and brought it up to 63 points.andP;  I just wanted to check the speed.andO;I was really amazed that it could do it so fast.&quot;andM;----------Reviews by Bob Enyart; interviews by Michelle Erickson; edited by JeffreyFrentzenandM;The what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) capability of a word processorshould rarely be the deciding factor in a purchase.andP;  As it turns out,products that enable editing of proportional fonts on the screen arereasonably equivalent in their ability to distinguish fonts on the screen.andM;Users must first define their standard word-processing or desktop-publishingneeds, adding WYSIWIG as simply another requirement.andP;  Reasonable selectioncriteria for a WYSIWYG word processor, then, will include features such asstyle sheets, user interface, hyphenation, spell checking, table of contentsand index generation.andM;WYSIWIG is an important new capability that can speed the production ofquality documents.andP;  However, no one should rush out and trade in asophisticated word processor just for one with a WYSIWIG text display.andP;  Manyother issues must be evaluated first.andM;-- Bob EnyartandM;Enable users to edit in multiple proportional fonts.andM;On powerful PCs, they provide a what-you-see-is-what-you-get environment forthe fastest possible creation of slick documents.andM;Products supporting standard user-interface environments such as Windows andPresentation Manager are easier to use and should remain stable, while otherswill likely migrate their non-standard interface, forcing users to relearnthe product.andM;Users of slow personal computers running at speeds between 4.77MHz and 10MHzshould steer clear of proportional-font word processors.andM;These products support such power features as automatic text wrapping,importation of bit-mapped images and multiple-language word processing.andP;
