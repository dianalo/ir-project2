The alphoid natureof the cloned DNA was established by partial sequencing. Southern analysisof restriction enzyme-digested DNA fragments from mouse/human hybridcells containing only human chromosome 21 showed that the predominanthigher-order repeating unit for pTRA-2 is a 3.9 kb structure. Analysisof a consensus in situ hybridization profile derived from 13 normal individualsrevealed the localization of 73% of all centromeric autoradiographicgrains over the five acrocentric chromosomes, with the following distribution:20.4%, 21.5%, 17.1%, 7.3% and 6.5% on chromosomes 13, 14, 21, 15 and22 respectively. An average of 1.4% of grains was found on the centromereof each of the remaining 19 nonacrocentric chromosomes. These resultsindicate the presence of a common subfamily of alpha satellite DNA onthe five acrocentric chromosomes and suggest an evolutionary processconsistent with recombination exchange of sequences between the nonhomologues.The results further suggests that such exchanges are more selective forchromosomes 13, 14 and 21 than for chromosomes 15 and 22. The possiblerole of centromeric alpha satellite DNA in the aetiology of 13q14q and14q21q Robertsonian translocation involving the common and nonrandomassociation of chromosomes 13 and 14, and 14 and 21 is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
