(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pupils given A's and B's for theirself-esteem and then told they had flunked third grade will beallowed to attend fourth grade this fall after all, schoolofficials say.   The fight started after a teacher at Alum Creek ElementarySchool, who has since quit, flunked 13 of 18 third-graders at theend of the school year. Some of the children had received A's andB's and even had made the honor roll.   Angry parents demanded to know how their children couldseemingly do so well and still flunk.   Jo Ann Litton, a Kanawha County elementary schools director,said the school had given the youngsters good grades and honors toavoid giving them ``a poor self-concept.''   The county agreed to put the children in the fourth grade ifthey passed comprehensive tests. All eight of the students takingthe tests last week did well enough to be promoted, said Alum Creekacting principal Eulah Mae Fleming.   Litton said she decided that the rest of the students should bepromoted also, though only on a nine-week, probationary status.   ``They were sent into the fourth grade with a very competentteacher, and we think she'll do a lot for them,'' Ms. Fleming said.</TEXT></DOC>
