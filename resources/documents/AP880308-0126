It was the second such incident since 1983 at the Symbio AnimalGardens at Stanwell Park south of Sydney, police said Monday.   ``I suppose they will stick the head on a wall and boast aboutit,'' said park owner Bob Grover. ``They probably wanted it becauseof its long, spiraling horns.''   The antelope, named Rajah, was beloved by the thousands ofchildren who visited each year. The park staff said its mate,Rajeesh, was pining for its companion.   Police said the poachers also skinned the animal after shootingit at close range.</TEXT></DOC>
