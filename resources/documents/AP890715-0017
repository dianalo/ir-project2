Assistant Secretary Charles E. Hess, who oversees science andeducation programs, said Friday he has named Gary R. Evans as hisspecial assistant for global change issues.   ``There are climate experts who claim the 1988 drought wasevidence that global warming has already begun,'' Hess said. ``Aconclusive link has not been proven, but the threat of globalwarming from heat trapped by so-called greenhouse gases is too muchof a risk to ignore.''   Those gases include carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, methane,nitrogen oxides and halons, Hess said in a statement. Some of thegases also seem to be causing a thinning of the high-level ozonelayer, which filters out a large part of the ultraviolet rays whichcan limite the growth of sensitive crops.   Evans, who has been deputy administrator of the department'sAgricultural Research Service, will coordinate activities amongseven USDA agencies and the land-grant universities as part of thedepartment's efforts to protect crops and forests, Hess said.</TEXT><NOTE>FBI Examines Contract Allegations At Fernald</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The FBI is investigating allegations ofcontract fraud at an Ohio plant that makes material for nuclearweapons, says a top Energy Department official.   The Fernald plant, where production was suspended earlier thisweek, also is the target of a special investigation by a DOE teamassessing health and safety measures and other aspects of theplant's operation.   ``Fernald's been at the top of our list for some time,'' saidDeputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore on Friday. ``We're going inthere to see what's wrong and what might need to be done to get intocompliance.''   FBI spokesman Edwin Boldt said from Cincinnati that theinvestigation was triggered by an allegation of criminal wrongdoingin contracting. He provided   no details.   The Fernald complex, located about 18 miles northwest ofCincinnati, is a key contributor to U.S. nuclear weapons production.It processes uranium compounds, produces uranium billets for nuclearweapons production and makes uranium target elements for defensenuclear reactors.   It's also one of the government's most seriously contaminatedfacilities.   The Environmental Protection Agency this week proposed addingFernald to the Superfund list of high-priority cleanup sites.</TEXT><NOTE>Rules Proposed for Security Ban on Foreign Takeovers</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Treasury Department has published forpublic comment proposed rules that would allow President Bush toplead national security and block takeover of a U.S. firm byforeigners.   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., and Rep. James J. Florio, D-N.J., whowere responsible for parts of the law, praised the proposedregulations published Friday in the Federal Register. The commentperiod runs through Sept. 12, although the Treasury Department saidlater comments will be considered if possible.   The Trade Act, signed by former President Ronald Reagan lastAugust, provides authority for the rules that would allow thepresident to block a merger if he has credible evidence that theforeign interest taking control might act to hurt U.S. security. Ifa president decides on an investigation, he gets 30 days to beginit, 45 days to complete it and another 15 days to announce it.   Florio said the Treasury has interpreted the law broadly to makesure that it covers a variety of ways that a foreign firm could takeover an American one.</TEXT><NOTE>US Making Progress on Compensation Concerning Iran Air Crash</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Bush administration will announce acompensation offer early next week for families of the non-Iranianvictims on the Iran Air flight shot down by a U.S. warship a yearago, officials say.   All but 40 of the 290 people who died were Iranian. The UnitedStates has said it would pay compensation to all families, but theIranian government has refused to provide details about its citizenswho died.   The 40 non-Iranians were Indians, Pakistanis, Koreans, Japaneseand citizens of several Arab countries.   The U.S. government has said it will not pay the Iraniangovernment directly, and Iran has called that position ``notacceptable.''   In civil lawsuits arising from crash deaths in the United States,courts generally award compensation based on the lost earnings of afamily member. Thus families of people who die early in lucrativecareers usually win larger awards than families of retired people.It is not known whether such an approach would be followed in thegovernment's compensation offer.   The officials, who asked not to be identified, on Friday wereunable to provide figures on the compensation package they expectbut said a formal announcement was expected early next week.</TEXT></DOC>
