Any such payments based on presumptive disability or blindnessare not considered overpayments if it is later determined that the personis not disabled or blind, unless the person is disallowed benefits dueto a nondisability eligibility criterion or it is later determined thatthe amount of the payment was incorrectly calculated. A finding of presumptive disability or presumptive blindness is made atthe district office in cases where the available evidence or other information,including observations and confirming contacts, indicates a high degreeof probability that the claimant is disabled or blind, even though theevidence may be insufficient for a final determination of disability orblindness by the State agency. A State agency may also make a finding of presumptive disability or blindness.Generally, a presumptive finding of disability or blindness made at theState agency may be based on any impairment when the evidence is sufficientto determine that there is a high degree of probability that the findingwill later be confirmed when complete evidence is obtained. On the other hand, district office findings are restricted to impairmentcategories for which experience has shown that particularly reliable findingsof presumptive disability and presumptive blindness can be made. The districtoffice may find presumptive disability and blindness in those situationsspecified in 20 CFR 416.934, provided that the claimant's statements abouthis or her medical condition are consistent with observations of the districtoffice representative or supported by confirming contacts. These limitationsinsure that presumptive findings are seldom reversed when actual medicalevidence is considered for the formal disability or blindness determinationsby the State agency. On February 11, 1985, we published interim regulations in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (50 FR 5573) adding AIDS as then defined by theCenters for Disease Control (CDC) to the impairment categories in andSection;416.934 to permit district offices to find presumptive disability for thisdisease. These regulations were effective February 11, 1985. Under the final regulations, the district office may find presumptive disabilitywhen a claimant, who is not working, alleges disability due to AIDS aftera confirming contact has been made to ascertain that this disease withone or more manifestations (described in Appendix 1 of Subpart I) has beendiagnosed by a licensed physician. Confirmation of this diagnosis willbe by contact with a physician or some other medical or treating source,such as a member of a hospital or clinic staff who is able to confirm thatsuch a diagnosis has been made. This confirming contact may be made bytelephone. Presumptive disability may be found immediately upon confirmationof the diagnosis of AIDS with manifestation(s) in Appendix 1 and need notbe delayed for the receipt of the actual medical reports or records. Afinal disability determination will be made later when sufficient medicalevidence is received by the State agency. We are extending the expiration date in these final regulations. This presumptivedisability category for AIDS will be effective through December 31, 1989.Several treatments are now being tested, and additional time is neededto be able to evaluate the efficacy of these treatments. Because of thedynamic nature of research concerning the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatmentof AIDS, this impairment category will require periodic review and reassessment.We intend to carefully monitor these regulations by providing for ongoingevaluation of the impairment category to determine whether they will needto be revised and updated to reflect advancements in scientific knowledgeand treatment of this disease. Therefore, these final regulations willcease to be effective after December 31, 1989, unless extended by the Secretaryor revised and promulgated again as a result of the findings from the evaluationperiod. <ITAG tagnum="52">Public Comments</ITAG>Interested persons, organizations, and groups were invited to submit data,views or arguments pertaining to the interim regulations within a periodof 60 days from the date of publication. The comment period ended on April12, 1985. Following are our responses to the comments. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter indicated that the CDC's definition ofAIDS was formulated for the purpose of epidemiologic surveillance and thatit may be too ``restrictive'' to use in determining presumptive disability.The commenter expressed concern that use of that definition may excludeclaimants who are disabled, despite their not meeting the specific criteriaof the CDC definition. We did not think at the time the interim regulations were published thatCDC's definition was too restrictive for the district offices to use indetermining presumptive disability because, when a presumptive disabilitydecision is made, it must be highly probable that disability will be foundlater when the medical evidence is obtained. We have also reviewed therevised CDC surveillance definition of AIDS (effective September 1, 1987)which defines AIDS in terms of its manifestation(s) by certain indicatordiseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalopathy (``HIVdementia'') and HIV wasting sydrome. We have determined that individualswho meet the revised definition and are not working may be found to bepresumptively disabled for Social Security purposes. However, we agree that the CDC definition of AIDS should not be directlylinked to Social Security presumptive disability determinations. CDC andSSA view AIDS from different perspectives. CDC defines AIDS for publichealth and other purposes that are not necessarily intended to have prognosticsignificance nor to designate the severity of the illness. By contrast,SSA must determine if the presumptive disability requirements of the laware met. Moreover, SSA has no control over possible future revisions ofthe CDC definition and uses no other program controlled definition or criteriato establish SSA presumptive disability eligibility. Therefore, althoughwe have deleted specific reference to the CDC definition of AIDS from theregulations, we are incorporating, for purposes of these regulations, thecriteria of the September 1, 1987 CDC definition of AIDS into the regulationsin Appendix 1. The net effect of this change is two-fold: It includes inthe regulations all the AIDS cases that meet the criteria of the CDC definitioneffective September 1, 1987, but it also means that future revisions tothe CDC definition of AIDS will not automatically affect SSA presumptivedisability determinations. However, we will look closely at any such revisionsand, if appropriate for presumptive disability purposes, we will modifyour eligibility criteria accordingly. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter objected to the statement in the preambleto the interim rule that the district office confirm with a medical ortreating source that the disease has progressed to the point that the individualis unable to work. This commenter believed that once the CDC definitionof AIDS has been diagnosed, it would be redundant to ask if the claimanthas the physical capacity to work. <T3>Response:</T3> We agree with the comment. We believe that it is highlyunlikely that an individual with AIDS that meets the CDC definition eitherbefore, or as of, September 1, 1987 would be able to engage in substantialgainful activity. Therefore, for purposes of making the presumptive disabilitydecision, it would be unnecessary to ask the treating source for an opinionregarding the individual's ability to work. Other comments expressed favorable views about these regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures </ITAG>Executive Order 12291 The Secretary has determined that this is not a major rule under ExecutiveOrder 12291 because these regulations do not meet any of the thresholdcriteria for a major rule. Therefore, a regulatory impact analysis is notrequired. Regulatory Flexibility Act We certify that these regulations will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities because they only affecta small number of disability claimants under Title XVI of the Social SecurityAct.
