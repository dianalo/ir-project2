The case of Richard Swann shows how it works and what a baleful influence it may have on government.    Mr. Swann, an Orlando, Fla., lawyer and thrift owner, popped up briefly in the inquiry into Speaker Wright, and was quickly forgotten when a cursory House Ethics Committee investigation found nothing wrong in the two men's dealings. Indeed, there has been no suggestion that what Mr. Swann has done is illegal. But he and his law firm, Swann andamp; Haddock, are famous in Florida for their political influence. His deal with Mr. Wright, a real-estate development near Orlando that earned the speaker about $50,000, is small potatoes compared with Mr. Swann's impact on state government.    That is precisely the point of the Wright affair. The damage comes from the kind of behavior that is condoned and found &quot;appropriate,&quot; not from the deeds that are censured. House Ethics Committee Special Counsel Richard Phelan detailed the damage that Messrs. Wright and Coelho did to the Sandamp;L industry by pressuring the regulators to go easy on their large contributors. These two bear much of the responsibility for turning a $20 billion thrift problem into a $300 billion national disaster, costing $1,250 for every man, woman and child in the U.S. Yet the Ethics Committee refused to endorse its counsel's finding of &quot;undue influence.&quot;    Mr. Swann's career in Florida shows where this influence can lead. No other state leaves its banks, thrifts, insurance companies, credit unions and HMOs so exposed to the political pull of campaign contributions.    All financial regulation lies in the hands of two elected state officers -- the comptroller, who also supervises banks and thrifts, and the insurance commissioner, who also serves as state treasurer. During the past decade Comptroller Gerald Lewis and then-Insurance Commissioner Bill Gunter turned their posts into a powerful joint fund-raising apparatus. Friends like Richard Swann played a crucial role, &quot;bundling&quot; contributions from allies and clients who sometimes had business pending before the regulators. According to one former fund-raiser, the system was so well coordinated that a bank could contribute to the insurance commissioner and an insurance company could contribute to the comptroller to avoid improper appearances.    Mr. Swann came to prominence in this system as Jimmy Carter's most important Florida fund-raiser, collecting about $1 million for Mr. Carter in both 1976 and 1980. He sponsored lavish political barbecues at his Orlando home. One guest remembers a helicopter shuttling a stream of federal dignitaries from the airport to Mr. Swann's lawn.    In 1976, Mr. Swann backed his friend Bill Gunter, a former congressman from north Florida, in a successful campaign for state insurance commissioner. Mr. Swann became known as Mr. Gunter's alter ego. According to former associates, the connection fostered the rapid growth of his law firm. Mr. Swann also took control of a troubled insurance company and an Orlando thrift.    In 1980, the state banking code expired under Florida's Sunset Law. Mr. Swann had a big hand in drafting a new law for Sandamp;Ls that greatly expanded their investment powers. This law, and even more liberal counterparts in Texas and California, let thrifts invest in &quot;unconventional assets,&quot; such as shopping malls, junk bonds and corporate subsidiaries, that federal officials blame for the extreme cost of the Sandamp;L debacle.    The new code helped Mr. Swann pull off an unusual &quot;reverse merger&quot; of his insurance company (with a $7.4 million net worth) and thrift (with a $5 million net worth) to produce a conglomerate called American Pioneer Corp. According to several former state regulators, State Comptroller Lewis made a special exception to allow the smaller thrift to swallow the larger insurance company. Using the broadened thrift code he helped draft, Mr. Swann then applied his thrift's assets to recapitalizing the insurance company.    A series of mergers expanded both the thrift and Mr. Swann's influence. In 1985, American Pioneer Savings Bank announced a merger with Heritage Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association of Daytona Beach. A lawyer with Heritage Federal, State Rep. Samuel Bell, became vice chairman of American Pioneer, drawing a salary of $150,000. Mr. Bell also was speaker-designate of the Florida House of Representatives. At the same time that Mr. Bell went on the payroll, Mr. Swann's law firm was an active and very effective lobbyist before the legislature.    Mr. Swann's arrangement with Mr. Bell went far beyond anything in the House Ethics Committee complaint against Jim Wright, yet in Florida such actions have not even been raised before the state's ethics commission. But Swann andamp; Haddock's dealings with the State Insurance Department raised eyebrows even in Miami.    In 1983, Mr. Swann's Tallahassee office obtained fast-track approval for two clients buying a Miami auto-insurance company, American Risk Assurance. The two turned out to be convicted fraud artists who had met in prison. They diverted about $1 million before the Insurance Department forced them into receivership. The end came quickly in part because the company's holdover president refused to pay Swann andamp; Haddock's legal fees.    In addition, Swann andamp; Haddock represented Miami-based Universal Casualty Insurance Co., until it collapsed in 1985 in the state's largest insurance failure. The owners of the cut-rate auto insurer subsequently pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges. During Universal Casualty's gaudy career, the State Insurance Department ignored vehement complaints from competitors that its television advertising and low premiums defied all the economic laws of insurance.    Mr. Swann himself blames these cases on the bad judgment of the former head of his Tallahassee law office, a former assistant insurance commissioner. The two have since split, and Mr. Swann has abandoned his Tallahassee business. Mr. Gunter resigned as insurance commissioner in 1988 for an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate. Comptroller Lewis is up for re-election next year.    But much as the faces change, few in Florida expect the system to reform. Once the habits of political pull become entrenched, they don't easily give way. And even though Jim Wright is now gone, few in Orlando count Mr. Swann out. He also raised funds last year for the presidential campaign of Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, who is now majority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives.    ---   Mr. Adams is writing &quot;The Big Fix,&quot; a book on savings and loan and bank scandals, for John Wiley andamp; Sons. </TEXT></DOC>
