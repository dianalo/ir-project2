SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The future is now for the American population:most of the people who will greet the next century already here,pursuing educations and careers.   The Americans watching the 20th century grind toward a halt arefar different than their ancestors who greeted the arrival of the1900s, an era that has seen the population move south and west andmake major shifts in family life, women's status and technology.   ``Over 80 percent of the people who will make up the populationof the United States in the year 2000 are now alive,'' reports a newstudy by the private Population Reference Bureau.   The ``next century's first high school graduating class, as wellas its drop-outs, are already in grade school; and the elderly ofthe 21st century are already well down paths that will determinetheir financial and health-care needs for old age,'' the independentBureau observed in a study released Thursday: ``America in the 21stCentury: A Demographic Overview.''   At the same time the Census Bureau issued its ``PopulationProfile of the United States 1989,'' looking at the currentpopulation status of the country.   The aging of America is likely the most discussed and documentedtrend, with 29.8 million elderly in the country as of 1987, 12.2percent of the population, and two-thirds of the group being women,the Census Bureau reported.   The agency says the number of elderly will continue growing intothe next century, jumping to one American in five when the massivepost-World War II Baby Boom generation hits senior citizen status byabout the year 2030.   That will critically affect health care and retirement incomeprograms, observes the Population Reference Bureau study.   There will be a relative scarcity of young people to take entrylevel jobs, school enrollment could shrink and employers will face adifferent mix of potential workers.   Retraining of older workers may become an economic necessity,says the private group, and there may become a need to easeimmigration rules to recruit certain skilled people from othercountries.   The ``traditional'' family makeup of a working husband with awife who stays home with the children has long-since changed. In1987, fewer than half of all families included children. In themajority of those that did, mothers held jobs outside the home.   At the same time, Population Reference Bureau noted, ``thegrowing incidence of divorce and out-of-wedlock births has fueled anenormous increase in single-parent families.''   Currently nearly one in four children lives with only one parent,compared to one in 10 in 1960, the population group said.   ``The growing concern over child care, elder care and parentalleave will continue well into next century,'' it concluded.   Rapidly growing black and Hispanic populations have alsoattracted attention in recent years, with the Census Bureaureporting that blacks now constitute 12.2 percent of Americans whileHispanics make up 8 percent _ meaning that, although there is someoverlap, these two groups now include nearly one in five Americans.   ``By 2000 nearly one-third of all school-age children will befrom minority populations _ a situation that presents a majorchallenge to our school systems,'' the Population Reference Bureaureported.</TEXT></DOC>
