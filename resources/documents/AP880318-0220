Communiques from both sides said seven jet fighters were shotdown and Iran claimed thousands of Iraqis slain in a northernoffensive.   Iran said its forces had captured two towns in a 5-day-old driveinto northeastern Iraq, in which it claims 9,200 Iraqis have beenkilled or wounded and 4,000 taken prisoner. It said its forces hadrecaptured Nowsud, an Iranian border town.   Nowsud was overrun by Iraqi soldiers soon after the war began inSeptember 1980.   Dispatches from the official Islamic Republic News Agencyclaimed five Iraqi jets were destroyed in 24 hours, including threeFrench-built F-1 Mirage fighter-bombers out to raid Iranian tankersin the northern Persian Gulf. Iraq claimed two Iranian jets downed.   Iraq acknowledged losing one plane, but Iran did not admitlosses.   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said itsplanes carried out 254 sorties against Iranian targets Fridayincluding a ``devastating raid'' on the northern city of Tabriz.   The news agency said air force planes evaded Iranian fighterpatrols and hit two ``large maritime targets,'' which usually meanstankers, off Iran between 9 p.m. Thursday and 9 a.m. Friday.   Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit in London confirmed oneattack, on the Iranian-chartered Cypriot tanker Kyrenicos. It saidat least one missile hit the 80,137-ton vessel as it steamed southfrom Iran's Kharg Island terminal with a full load before dawnFriday.   Chartered and Iranian-owned tankers shuttle oil for export fromKharg, which has been a frequent target of Iraqi bombing raids, tomakeshift terminals in the safer waters of the southern gulf.   Iranian gunboats attacked three neutral ships in the southerngulf Friday in apparent retaliation for the Kyrenicos raid and twoother confirmed Iraqi attacks in recent days. There had been amonthlong lull in the ``tanker war,'' in which more than 400 shipshave been hit since it began four years ago.   Shipping officials said a Japanese seaman was killed on thePanamanian tanker Maria 2 in the first Iranian raid soon aftermidnight and the other 20 crewmen, all South Koreans, abandonedship when a fire started. Several were reported wounded, but allwere rescued by the United Arab Emirates coast guard.   An attack on the 284,494-ton Norwegian tanker Berge Lord starteda small fire and the 87,768-ton Singapore-flag tanker NeptuneSaburu also was hit. No casualties were reported in either case.   IRNA, the Iranian agency, said 24 missiles were fired lateThursday and early Friday into Zubair, an industrial town insouthern Iraq, and Haretha and Shubair nearby.   Six short-range rockets were fired at the southern port ofBasra, Khanaqin in the central border area, Mosul in Kurdistan andthe northern frontier town of Banmil, it said.   According to Iraqi dispatches, seven long-range missiles werelaunched at Tehran. Iran reported at least eight civilians killedand many wounded.   Baghdad Radio announced two more Iranian missiles struck thenorthern cities of Mosul and Kirkuk Friday night. But Tehrantelevision announced two missiles were fired at each city in theattacks.   Iraq gave no report on its casualties from missile attacks.   Hundreds of civilians have been killed on both sides in thelatest round of the intermittent ``war of the cities,'' which beganFeb. 29, and thousands have died since the conflict began.   Reports of artillery attacks and air raids on a dozen othercities, with heavy casualties, came from both sides.   Tehran said Revolutionary Guards pushing into the northernmountains Friday overran the ``military towns'' of Tawla, threemiles north of Nowsud, and Byara a few miles farther north, killingor wounding 700 Iraqis and capturing 200.   War communiques claimed Iranian forces had seized nearly 400square miles of territory with a two-pronged offensive.   According to IRNA, the drive was being led by Soviet-made T-72tanks captured from the Iraqis when the Iranians stormed the FawPeninsula in southern Iraq two years ago.   It claimed Iraqi warplanes dropped chemical bombs on Dojaila andHalabja, two northeastern towns captured Thursday, ``killing manydefenseless residents.''   A correspondent for the agency reported the two towns were ``inruins,'' strewn with the bodies of civilians. He said the Iraqisalso dropped cluster and phosporous bombs that killed ``scores ofpeople.''</TEXT></DOC>
