(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Army investigators Monday tried tofind the cause of a helicopter crash that killed six men duringdesert training exercises.   There was no immediate word on whether the pilot of the UH-60Blackhawk helicopter was wearing night-vision goggles of a typethat has been criticized as a safety threat, said Maj. JohnWagstaffe, a base spokesman.   The helicopter crashed at 4 a.m. Saturday as its crew wasdirecting other aircraft in a mock attack in the Mojave Desert.   ``It is standard procedure for crews to wear night visiongoggles while on missions of that type here,'' said Wagstaffe.``But whether this crew was wearing them will have to be determinedby the investigation.''   The goggles have come under criticism recently because, amongother things, they significantly narrow a pilot's field of vision.They were originally designed for ground troop use.   The goggles were used by pilots during crashes that have killed150 servicemen and destroyed 69 helicopters since 1978, accordingto one newspaper investigation.   Three officers and three non-commissioned officers died in thecrash. A corporal suffered a broken leg, the Pentagon said.   All the soldiers aboard were from the 1st Cavalry Division atFort Hood, Texas. They were at the 1,000-square-mile base for athree-week exercise that coincidentally ended Saturday.   The accident occurred while 1st Cavalry troops waged mock battleagainst units posing as Soviet forces at Fort Irwin's NationalTraining Center, with the Blackhawk crew directing two Apache AH-64assault helicopters.   A team from the U.S. Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker, Ala.,will be on the scene for at least a week, and the investigationwill likely conclude in three to four months, said Safety Centerspokesman Lt. Col. Herb Blanks in a telephone interview.   The Safety Center has the power to ground the $4.6 millionUH-60, but they remained flying on Monday.   The Army's fleet of 820 UH-60s was grounded twice in May 1987,once for inspection and once because of a design flaw. The entirefleet also was grounded in April 1985 and March 1986 after fatalcrashes. In 1985, the Army identified a defect in the main rotorassembly and ordered it corrected.   Blanks said the crash was the fourth of a UH-60 since October.There were five such accidents last fiscal year, he said, adding:``There is no abnormal trend, not when you consider the amount ofhours they fly.''   The colonel said no repeated structural flaws have been found.   ``The majority of our accidents are human error,'' he said.   The two-engine Blackhawk is designed as a utility and assaultaircraft. It normally is operated with a crew of three and cancarry 11 combat-equipped soldiers.   It is made by Sikorsky Aircraft, a division of UnitedTechnologies based in Stratford, Conn.   At the Pentagon, those killed in the crash were identified asLt. Col. William C. Whittingstall, 40, Iowa Park, Texas; Capt.Marlon D. Joseph, 33, Houston; 1st Lt. Robert B. Wilson, 26,Dumfries, Va.; Chief Warrant Officer 4 Roy A. Westbrook, 42,Poteet, Texas; Chief Warrant Officer 3 Adelbert L. Morrow, 41,Hemet, Calif.; and Staff Sgt. Stephen P. Thompson, 28, Sacramento,Calif.   The injured soldier was identified as Scott A. Matthews, 24, ofCorpus Christi, Texas.</TEXT></DOC>
