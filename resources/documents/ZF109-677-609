Thornburgh that Justicewould cooperate fully, &quot;the department has thwarted attempts by Congress tolearn the complete truth concerning the Inslaw case,&quot; Brooks said.andP;  &quot;Now thedepartment is blocking our efforts to see more than 200 Inslaw documentslocated in its files, claiming that these documents are privileged.&quot;andM;As litigation in the case is continuing, Thornburgh has maintained that thedepartment has the right to withhold documents because of attorney-client andwork product privilege.andM;&quot;I know of no basis upon which the department can withhold information fromthe Congress,&quot; said Elliott Richardson, a former attorney general who isrepresenting Inslaw.andP;  He argued that Congress' oversight authority supersedesthe confidentiality claimed by Thornburgh, although the congressionalauthority would not extend to giving Inslaw the information.andM;The Inslaw case goes back to Justice's early termination of a $10 millioncontract to provide case management software that Inslaw won in 1982.andP;  Sincethen Hamilton has taken his charges into the courtroom, succeeding in bothbankruptcy and civil suits.andM;Justice attorneys are continuing to appeal these decisions.andP;  So far, Hamiltonhas not seen any of the $6.8 million that the U.S.andP;  Bankruptcy Court ruledInslaw was entitled to.andM;Brooks (D-Texas) said the hearing last week of the Judiciary Subcommittee onEconomic and Commercial Law gave him an opportunity not only to consider theInslaw case, but also to look &quot;at other contracting and management problemsthat are currently plaguing the department.&quot;andM;The GAO staff has been working with the committee to review Justice ADPmanagement since Brooks became chairman two years ago.andP;  &quot;Believe me, it's nota pretty picture,&quot; Brooks said.andM;He has raised serious doubts about the department's office automationprogram, Project Eagle.andP;  Earlier this year he cut the 1991 Eagle budget.andM;Recently, Justice announced plans to create a new IRM position in the agency.andO;Previously, the ADP and IRM oversight fell to the deputy assistant attorneygeneral for information and administrative services.andP;  This latest moveappears to be an effort by top Justice management to break out ADP oversightfrom the administrative umbrella.andM;Justice officials did not testify at the hearing, which is expected tocontinue next year.andP;  Rep.andP;  Hamilton Fish Jr.andP;  (R-N.Y.) said that without thedepartment's testimony it would be premature for the committee to concludethat the department had acted wrongly.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
