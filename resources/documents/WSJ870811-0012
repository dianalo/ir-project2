The proposed rules of the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration generally would make final a package of interim regulations that have been in effect since last Dec. 16. The proposal involves site analysis, worker training, medical surveillance, protective equipment, waste handling and emergency response, among other requirements.    Most of the workers subject to hazardous-waste dangers are firefighters, OSHA said, and others include cleanup workers and those who treat, store, dispose of or otherwise handle hazardous materials. Congress has directed the Environmental Protection Agency to issue standards matching OSHA's final rules, to cover state and municipal workers in states that don't have OSHA-approved job health and safety programs.    OSHA asked for comments on the proposal by Oct. 5, and scheduled several public hearings during October. The agency estimated the cost for compliance with the proposed rules at $148 million a year. </TEXT></DOC>
