The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization andthe Worldwatch Institute, an environmental group inWashington, issued similarly gloomy forecasts at a time when500 million people already are underfed world-wide and atleast 24 nations are short of food.</LP><TEXT>   World agricultural production dropped 1.4% in 1991 becauseof drought, wars and numerous disruptions in farm productionand food distribution, according to the Rome-based FAO. Itwas the first such decline in eight years. The world's grainharvest, meantime, fell a staggering 86 million metric tons,or nearly 5%, largely because of reduced plantings in theU.S. and much smaller crops in the politically chaotic SovietUnion.   Taking population growth into account, the global grainharvest, including wheat and rice, is down 6.6% per person,according to Worldwatch President Lester Brown. The decreasewill be only partly offset by tapping grain stockpiles, amove that in turn is likely to drive up grain prices in thecoming months.   &quot;In many Third World countries, millions are being forcedto tighten their belt when there are no notches left,&quot; Mr.Brown said at a news conference here.   His concerns about the food situation were echoed by FAOofficials, who foresee serious food shortages in Romania,Albania and many urban areas in the Soviet Union, as well asfamine in the Horn of Africa and Iraq.   &quot;The world will enter 1992 once again consuming more thanit produces, and stocks will be drawn down to dangerously lowlevels,&quot; cautioned Edouard Saouma, the FAO'sdirector-general, in a written statement. &quot;As our margin ofsafety is reduced, our food security next year will depend toa large extent on the success or failure of the 1992harvests.&quot;   Mr. Saouma said Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, wheregrain production this year fell 25% from a bumper 1990 crop,will need substantial food aid during their transition tofree-market economies. But he cautioned against aidingremnants of the Soviet empire at the expense of Third Worldcountries.   In Somalia, Mr. Saouma noted, 4.5 million people, or 60%of the population, face starvation. The situation remainsgrave in the Sudan and Ethiopia, where millions of peopleurgently need food assistance, he added. Civil conflict,meanwhile, continues to disrupt relief operations inMozambique.   Severe food shortages persist in Iraq following thePersian Gulf War. The U.N. has agreed to let Saddam Hussein'sregime use oil revenue to import food, but the Iraqipresident hasn't availed himself of the opportunity. Foodinflation remains so high that many segments of the Iraqipopulation are all but priced out of the market, according tothe FAO. This has caused serious malnutrition and high childdeath rates.   The Worldwatch Institute's Mr. Brown expects grainconsumption, on average, to fall 3.4% per person world-widein 1992 -- and even more sharply in 44 nations with fallingper capita incomes.   &quot;While the average is falling, people in countries whereincomes are rising are likely to consume more grain this yearthan last,&quot; he said. &quot;As a result, the fall in consumptiondisproportionately will hit those countries where foreignexchange is scarce and incomes are falling. The rise in grainprices resulting from this year's tighter supply will onlyexacerbate the situation.&quot;   In 1992, Mr. Brown said, the world's grain reserves areprojected to sink to their lowest levels since 1976 -- enoughto last only 68 days. Bad weather, combined with an expecteddrop in Soviet production, could reduce reserves below a60-day supply and create &quot;an extremely volatile pricesituation,&quot; particularly for wheat, he added.   James Donald, a senior Agriculture Department economist,doesn't take such a bleak view. There wouldn't have been arecord drop in global grain production, he said, if U.S. andSoviet farmers hadn't been coming off bumper crops in 1990.And he expects U.S. grain output to rise next year because ofless restrictive controls on wheat and corn planting. He alsoexpects grain stocks in Canada and the European Community toremain relatively high.   Mr. Brown doesn't foresee any improvement in foodprospects, especially over the long term. The world's &quot;foodsecurity,&quot; he says, is undermined by several global trends,including an accelerated loss of cropland per person, lessirrigated land per person, higher rates of soil erosion, andreduced crop yields due to acid rain and air pollution.   Climatic change also may be working against agriculture inthe U.S. and elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, he said.In four of the past 11 years, higher-than-normaltemperatures, coupled with drought, have reduced yields inthe parts of the Corn Belt and the wheat-growing GreatPlains.   World grain production per person has fallen nearly 9%after peaking at 343 kilograms in 1984, he said.   Mr. Brown doesn't see any technological breakthroughs thatwill lead to &quot;quantum jumps&quot; in crop production such asresulted from the development of hybrid corn or high-yieldingwheats and rices, the near-tripling in irrigated area and theninefold gain in fertilizer use since 1950.</TEXT></DOC>
