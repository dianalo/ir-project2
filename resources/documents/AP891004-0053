(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prosecutors contended that PTL founderJim Bakker solicited money for lifetime partnerships at hisHeritage USA retreat and used the money for his own benefit ratherthan for the lodging he promised. The defense said Bakker was avictim of circumstance, a devout minister who was not blessed withgood business sense.   Here is a look at some key points raised by the prosecution anddefense.</TEXT><TEXT>   PROSECUTION: Bakker hid information from the PTL board ofdirectors and did not give the board a true financial picture ofPTL's problems.   DEFENSE: Bakker said the board was aware of cash flow problemsand voted to borrow funds to pay for them.</TEXT><TEXT>   PROSECUTION: The Bakkers used PTL funds to support their lavishlifestyle, receiving more than $3 million in bonuses in themid-1980s, often during periods of financial trouble for theministry when many PTL employees were laid off.   DEFENSE: Bakker said the board members voted for bonuses ``oftheir own free will,'' adding that he accepted $3.1 million, lessthan 1 percent of what he raised for the ministry.   __   PROSECUTION: Bakker was creating ``a false sense of urgency'' in1984 when he told viewers that 50 percent of the 25,000partnerships at Heritage Grand Hotel were taken when computerrecords showed fewer than 4,000 had been bought.   DEFENSE: Bakker said PTL's computers typically ran six monthsbehind.</TEXT><TEXT>   PROSECUTION: Former top Bakker aide David Taggert testified thatBakker had him relay instructions to divert Lifetime Partnershipmoney to PTL's general expenses.   DEFENSE: Bakker said Taggert was lying.</TEXT><TEXT>   PROSECUTION: Bakker fleeced followers by overselling ``lifetimepartnerships.'' Lifetime partners paid $1,000 for an annualguarantee of three night and four days at Heritage USA.   DEFENSE: Partnerships were not sales transactions and thepayments were gifts to the ministry. The ministry had adequatefacilities to handle more than 150,000 partnerships already sold.</TEXT><TEXT>   PROSECUTION: Called witnesses who said they were turned awaywhen they tried to use their lodging benefits.   DEFENSE: Countered by calling to testify ``lifetime partners''who said they never had trouble getting space in Heritage USAfacilities.</TEXT><TEXT>   PROSECUTION: Backing the contention that Bakker dipped into PTLfunds for personal use, former PTL executive Richard Dortchtestified that Bakker authorized a $265,000 payoff in PTL funds toJessica Hahn to keep her quiet about their sexual encounter.
