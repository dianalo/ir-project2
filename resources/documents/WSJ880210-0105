Interest rates had dipped and consumer demand for residential mortgages was brisk. In only its second year in business, Falcon, a Santa Rosa, Calif.-based mortgage lender, racked up revenue of $126 million and doubled the number of offices to four. But by mid-1987 the rate and demand trends had reversed, and Falcon was squeezed.    At year end Falcon's revenue had fallen to $76 million, and last December it slashed its staff to 12 workers from 48 and closed two offices.    &quot;The bloom went off the rose,&quot; says R. Michael Reilly, Falcon's managing partner. &quot;I think '88 is going to be a tough year.&quot;    Scores of lenders would agree. Industrywide layoffs and office closings that began last year are expected to pick up in 1988. The Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group, predicts a drop in mortgage volume to about $325 billion this year from $425 billion last year and $454 billion in 1986. And despite the drop in recent weeks in mortgage-interest rates that has generated a surge in consumer traffic, industry executives say the long-term view for mortgage demand is gloomy. Consequently, as many as 500 lenders -- nearly 7% of the industry -- are expected to disappear this year, either through mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies or a temporary withdrawal, says SMR Research Corp., a Budd Lake, N.J., mortgage research firm.    &quot;What you're seeing is an industry in the wringing-out process,&quot; says Lawrence J. Trautman, a mortgage industry analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette.    Hardest hit are expected to be mortgage bankers, commercial banks and thrifts that significantly expanded branch operations to accommodate the heavy demand of 1986. Collectively, they account for about 92% of all loan volume.    The industry's contraction is being aggravated by aggressive pricing largely by thrifts that many lenders can't afford to match. In Chicago some thrifts are offering one-year adjustable-rate mortgages at 6 7/8%, lower than the national 8% average for similar loans.    A benefit to consumers, the lower 6 7/8% rate on a $100,000 mortgage translates into monthly payments of $657, a savings of $77 a month, over an 8% mortgage.    But such pricing &quot;clearly puts pressure on earnings&quot; and discourages other lenders from matching them, says Michael L. Wilson, vice president of research for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, a trade group of 3,200 thrifts. Moreover, the marked-down rates, Mr. Wilson says, will exacerbate the conditions of some lenders already hurt by souring commercial real estate loans. Industry analysts say this could push more than 50 Sandamp;Ls into insolvency this year.    Such turmoil is hardly new to the industry. In 1981 and 1982, mortgage interest rates reached 17%, shut out consumers from the market and triggered an industrywide contraction. But this year's projected fallout is expected to cut a wider swath because operations grew by unprecedented bounds two years ago to accommodate record consumer demand generated by 8% and 9% fixed-rate mortgages.    &quot;The 1986 volume levels reflected a once-in-a-lifetime event,&quot; says Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association. &quot;People staffed up like it was going to last forever.&quot;    The bubble burst last spring as mortgage rates rose above 10%, forcing lenders like CityFed Mortgage Co. to confront the changing fortunes. Last month, the big Bellevue, Wash., lender announced 1,600 layoffs, 37% of its work force; closed 20 of its 116 offices; and merged its two mortgage units. The cutbacks, CityFed said, were made to counter a 50% drop in business to $1.5 billion in last year's second half. More consolidation is expected later this year, a spokesman says, because &quot;we aren't expecting any rapid improvement.&quot;    Even lenders like BankEast Mortgage Corp., which pared back last year, now say they may be forced to trim some more this year. The Manchester, N.H., lender took its hit in October, reducing staff by 50% to 110 workers to reflect a projected drop in volume to $180 million this year from $370 million last year.    While the situation may not be as serious for some lenders like Dime Savings Bank of New York, the thrift, which last month said loan volume won't reach 1986's level of $5.25 billion, says it is scrutinizing industry developments. Though no layoffs or office closings are currently planned, Franklin L. Wright, executive vice president of the Garden City, N.Y.-based lender, says those options nonetheless are being reviewed &quot;very closely right now.&quot;    With so many lenders expecting abrupt declines in loan demand, industry executives say the business will become ripe for failures. But so far this year, there haven't been any reports of mortgage lenders failing exclusively because of softening demand.    Adding to the problem is the pressure from competitors offering steeply discounted adjustable-rate mortgages.    Because discounted mortgages put a strain on bottom lines, many lenders say they won't offer them. Premier Home Finance Inc. is one lender that has taken a chance. The suburban Chicago company offers one-year 6 7/8% ARMs, one of the lowest rates for this type of mortgage in the Chicago area. The interest rate can't be increased by more than two points during any one year and can't go up by more than six points over its life.    While Premier's president, Lawrence M. Budnik, concedes that margins on discounted loans are slimmer, he maintains he is turning a slight profit.    Some lenders say they avoid discounted mortgages because institutional investors who buy mortgage-backed securities also avoid them. The reasons: the discounts and the interest-rate caps limit potential income.    Without institutional buyers, mortgage bankers and other lenders that usually sell their residential mortgages to investors, would be forced to hold the loans. Thrifts generally can afford to do this because they can use other assets to fund new mortgages. But many other lenders don't have that capacity because they use cash from the sale of their mortgages to write new loans.    &quot;We don't hold them,&quot; says James M. Wooten, president of Dallas-based Lomas andamp; Nettleton Co. &quot;If we do hold them, it's because we made a mistake.&quot;    Many lenders believe the pricing tactics are mistakes that over time will further weaken the industry and render some players more vulnerable to takeovers. There are already early signs of that.    Last week, for example, a group including members of the Vancouver, Canada-based Belzberg family said it bought a 6.6% stake in Countrywide Credit Industries Inc., a Los Angeles-based company primarily engaged in mortgage lending. The Belzberg group said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it bought the stake in Countrywide for investment purposes, though the group indicated that it may also seek to acquire a controlling position.    Six companies, meanwhile, have submitted bids for San Francisco-based First Interstate Mortgage Corp., say people familiar with the negotiations. The lender, which expects its volume this year to fall to $880 million from $1.1 billion in 1987, was put on the block last year by its Los Angeles-based parent, First Interstate Bancorp., as part of streamlining efforts. John C. Opperman, chairman of First Interstate Mortgage, wouldn't comment on the sale, but says a closing is anticipated in the second quarter.    &quot;The industry is beat up,&quot; says Mr. Trautman, the industry analyst. &quot;Anyone who has been looking for deals understands that the values are good. I think you'll see five years' worth of deals in the next 18 months.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
