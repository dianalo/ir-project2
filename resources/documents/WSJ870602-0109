The construction materials company said the four investors, who disclosed their 5.02% holding in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week, have no additional financing and no history of operating a company.    Continental adjourned its annual meeting last week to give shareholders a chance to review a proposed anti-takeover amendment. Continental said it will resume the meeting tomorrow.    The four investors are Leroy E. Haupt, Phillip Green, James Tellatin and Bernard Tureen. Three are retired businessmen, and one is an appraiser. Their attorney, Robert Holstein, declined to comment on the board's decision.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Continental closed at $23, down 37.5 cents.
