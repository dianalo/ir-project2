Deficit reduction is a relatively short-term objective, in thatthe goal is to achieve a balanced budget within five years.Promoting economic growth implies a perspective that extends intothe 21st century.   The realities of the political constraints faced by thecommission during the presidential election and transition periodleft no serious possibility of carrying out the first responsibilityon a bipartisan basis.   The Democratic members of the commission concluded, reluctantlyand sadly, that the Republican members' understandable desire tosupport the new president's plan for achieving deficit reductionprecluded any likelihood of bipartisan agreement.   The constraints he imposed and his flexible freeze plan areplainly and simply inconsistent with ensuring that the burden ofdeficit reduction does not fall disproportionately on any oneeconomic group, social group, region or state.   The fact remains, however, that the majority of commissionersbelieve that our national savings rate is too low and thatcontinuing large budget deficits and huge, seemingly intractabletrade deficits threaten the nation's long-term prospects for strongeconomic growth. The views in Part II of our report are directedtoward these longer-run concerns.   What is at stake is how we as a nation enter the 21st century. Wecan either slouch into the next century, or we can march into it allflags flying. Our future posture will depend upon whether, inHamilton's term, we get our ``political arithmetic'' in order in thenext five years.   Getting our political arithmetic in order means achieving budgetbalance by fiscal year 1993 _ anything earlier being wishfulthinking _ and moving into surpluses thereafter. The surplus goalsare readily identifiable; they should be approximately equal to thecombined surplus of the Social Security trust funds.   There is no option in the sense of an alternative use for thesurpluses. The revenue stream to finance the surplus already existsin the form of payroll taxes that are high enough to put the SocialSecurity system on a ``partially funded'' basis.   If the present practice of using these surpluses to pay forcurrent consumption continues, the pressure to return to a``pay-as-you-go'' basis will become irresistible, and the payrolltaxes will be returned to a ``pay-as-you-go'' level.   On the other hand, if we can summon the political will to savethe surplus, we will transform our economy and secure our futurebeyond any present expectations.</TEXT><HEAD>End Deficit Excerpts _ 3 Takes</HEAD></DOC>
