It was really nut brittle,and very tasty nut brittle at that. But it was also an inspirational goody,cooked up to save us from ourselves.;    Rainforest Crunch makes an argumentfor social justice. &quot;Community Products Inc.,&quot; said a notice on the package,&quot;is helping to demonstrate that rain forests are more profitable whenpreserved for sustainable harvests. The profits from the nuts we buy are usedto develop small Brazil-nut-processing factories that are cooperatively ownedand operated by forest peoples, providing them with three to 10 times thenormal income for their labor.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LOOK OUT! NEW PURITANS READY TO SAVE THEWORLD  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  John Allemang, a free-lance writer, wrote this article for the Toronto Globeand Mail.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Phew! The champagne truffles of the 1980s could never have made suchclaims. I read on and gave my sense of guilt free rein. &quot;Start recycling!&quot; thepackage ordered. This was not a fund-raising letter from Friends of the Earth.It was nut brittle, and it was lecturing me.;    With candy acting as an agentof social change, the final escape hatch is closed. The 1990s are upon us witha vengeance. Self-important, guilt-tripping, holier-than-thou and unforgiving,this decade is the best revenge on the materialistic spree of theself-centered 1980s.;    The puritans whose tsk-tsking went unheard over thelast few years are getting ready to exact some penance. As the threats ofglobal warming look more and more ominous and the recession gives a bad nameto the free market, a new orthodoxy is preparing to take charge. It comes witha sense of urgency that allows no room for compromise.;    Descended from theprotest movements and alternative cultures of the 1960s, the new puritanismdefines itself in opposition to the status quo. Capitalism is bad and leads tothe wasteful and destructive exploitation of the planet. Western culture isbad. It oppresses those who are not straight white males and elevates the ideaof individual liberty. Individual liberty is bad, because it leads to peoplesaying what they think and doing as they please. And isn't that what got usinto this mess in the first place?;    No little detail, no part of life, nopleasure, however harmless (and what pleasure is really harmless?), can escapethe scrutiny of the new puritans.;    Want to go for a Sunday drive? Just trynot to think about the Greenpeace ad with the picture of the Exxon Valdezskipper and the guilt-ridden caption, &quot;It wasn't his driving that caused theoil spill; it was yours.&quot;;    There is no escape. And maybe we do not reallywant to escape. Alcohol abuse, a short-sighted dependency on oil, sexualharassment -- no one pretends that these and a thousand other problems do notexist. If the free-spending, self-indulgent 1980s could not or would not dealwith them, then perhaps it is time for a more radical solution.;    Theevidence so far for a fundamental shift in values and beliefs is notencouraging. In the name of global survival, the new puritans indulge inrelentless moralizing. Preaching tolerance of diversity, they fosterintolerance and conformity.;    An ugly incident in Vancouver, BritishColumbia, last September demonstrated the 1990s approach to consensusbuilding. When a Portuguese cafe owner complained about women hugging eachother in his cafe, his gay and lesbian customers fought back. They took overthe cappuccino bar and held a kiss-in, then moved outside, drove away businessand shouted, &quot;We're here; we're queer; we don't want your coffee.&quot;;    Butactivists who champion their own differences should not be surprised todiscover that there is more than one kind of diversity.;    Diversity in the1990s has come to mean: You've kicked us around; now it is our turn to kickyou. And given the prevailing climate of white, middle-class guilt, what thiscomes to mean is: Our ancestors kicked you; now it is our turn to kickourselves.;    The year 1992 will see a huge outpouring of anger as nativepeoples, churches and human-rights groups line up to denounce the 500thanniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in America.;    Still, not allracism is created equal. It is permissible, and in some circles laudable, totrash what is called the dominant culture. Any debate about racism in thisdecade is bound to end in frustration for all sides, because there is no wayto bring together the liberal notions of free speech and tolerance with theoutraged sensitivities of the anti-racists.;    Like every dream ofperfection, the utopia of the 1990s is filled with nags and scolds andbusybodies and prudes who expect and demand compliance. By seeking an absolutepurity in all things, by worshiping pristine nature and untainted nativepeoples, they are trying to give our muddled species a new model and a freshstart. But the all-too-human qualities of envy, intolerance, impatience,vengeance and self-interest are poisoning this heaven on Earth.;    Socialreformers always face the same problem: Some people are not ready to bereformed. But the new puritans, like the old ones, do not care. Their aim isto wear down, not win over. It is so much easier to rage when faced with humanimperfection than to persuade or understand or just plain ignore. But youcannot claim the higher moral ground by suppressing arguments, rewritinghistory and legislating away behavior. Refusing to allow what you do not wantto hear is moral cowardice. And that is a rotten foundation for a brave newdecade.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JOHN ALLEMANG  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910602  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  944  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday June 2, 199100154013,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
