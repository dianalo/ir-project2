In the course of the proceedings Wednesday, the basis ofan earlier-proposed rejection by administrative law judgeswas thrown into question when a spokesman for the stateattorney general disputed part of an advisory opinion thatlaw judges relied on.</LP><TEXT>   Prospective anti-competitive effects are considered apotential stumbling block to approval of the merger ofSCEcorp's Southern California Edison Co. unit with San DiegoGas, a transaction that would create the nation's largestinvestor-owned utility, with a territory covering much of theresidential and industrial heartland of southern California.   Setting the tone of discussion at the unusual &quot;en banc&quot;hearings, in which all five members of the California PublicUtilities Commission participated, Commissioner C. MitchellWilk said he would be guided in part by the marketplaceeffects of the transaction. &quot;Is competition enhanced -- notjust preserved -- much less diminished?&quot; he asked in openingremarks.   Other members of the panel repeatedly probed witnesses'views of competitive constraints and gains that might resultfrom the merger, including the effect on wholesale powermarkets and contracts with outside power producers.   Administrative law judges recommended Feb. 1 that thecommission reject the merger, partly on grounds that it wouldreduce competition in regional wholesale markets forelectrical power, even as the combined operations promised $1billion in savings over 10 years to the utilites and theircustomers.   The law judges' 1,300-page proposed rejection waspredicated on an advisory opinion from California'sthen-attorney general, John Van de Kamp, that the combinationwould have unacceptable anti-competitive effects.   However, a spokesman for current state attorney general,Daniel Lungren, said that while the opinion formally stands,Mr. Lungren finds parts of his predecessor's analysis&quot;fatally flawed.&quot;   The spokesman, special assistant attorney general ThomasF. Gede, said Mr. Lungren believes that regulators mustconsider the balance of competitive effects, both good andbad, rather than rejecting a merger application because itcontains some anti-competitive elements.   The distinction is central to approval or disapproval ofthe measure. Mr. Gede said Mr. Lungren hadn't formallyoverturned his predecessor's recommendation because therewasn't time to apply Mr. Lungren's revised reading of the lawto the details of this particular case.   Recently enacted California law requires that largeprospective mergers be considered both in light of thebenefits for ratepayers and in light of competitive concerns.The law appears to separate the competitive concerns in sucha way that it can be read either to disallow mergers thatcontain any anti-competitive elements or to disallow onlymergers in which the balance of anti-competitive elements,both good and bad, is detrimental. As part of the process,the law requires the attorney general to advise on theanti-competitive implications of any merger.   In their Feb. 1 opinion recommending that the CaliforniaPUC reject the merger, law judges Lynn Carew and Brian Craggrelied on the narrow interpretation that no substantialanti-competitive elements can be permitted. But Mr. Lungren'spartial disavowal of his predecessor's opinion leftcommissioners on uncertain ground.   &quot;The law requires the commission to consider many thingsin this merger,&quot; said Commissioner Wilk in his remarks, &quot;andone cannot select the laws with which one is willing tocomply.&quot;   &quot;We may wish the laws to be more sensible or go in otherdirections, but, until they do, we will obey them,&quot; he added.   The commission is expected to rule on the proposedtransaction in April.</TEXT></DOC>
