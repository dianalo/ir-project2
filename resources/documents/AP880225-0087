Bennett saidtoday that college entrance test scores ``are in a dead stall'' andthe public is still not getting its money's worth from the schools.   ``In saying that I am disappointed, I think I speak for theAmerican people,'' said Bennett in his annual report card on thestates.   Bennett was delivering that verdict at a news conference wherehe was also releasing two wall charts nearly six feet wide crammedwith statistics ranking the states on test scores, dropout rates,how much they pay teachers and other measures.   It was the fifth straight year that an education secretary hasreleased the controversial wall charts. Bennett's predecessor, T.H.Bell, initiated the practice.   John Weiss, executive director of FairTest, a Cambridge, Mass.,group that is critical of standardized tests, said, ``It makes nosense to use a faulty thermometer to measure the nation'seducational health.''   Bennett said the school reform movement is alive and yieldingpositive results in some states, but ``there is still too muchresistance to sensible and needed reform,'' includingaccountability measures and merit pay.   This year, for the first time, the wall chart includes a list ofseven states (Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, Ohio, SouthCarolina and Texas) with laws allowing state officials to intervenein ``academically bankrupt'' school districts.   It also lists the percentage of high scorers on the ScholasticAptitude Test and American College Testing program, and thepercentage of high school graduates who took Advanced Placementexams.   The college entrance test scores were not new. They were madepublic last fall.   Bennett lamented that they ``are in a dead stall. The 1987scores are basically unchanged from last year. The ACT averagedipped by 0.1 point to 18.7, and the SAT remained the same _ 906.''The ACT is graded on a scale of 1-36 and the SAT on a scale of400-1,600.   Bennett said the graduation rate from public high schoolsslipped from 71.7 percent in 1985 to 71.5 percent in 1986. Nofigure was available for private schools.   ``All of this is not particularly good news,'' said Bennett, whorecently began his fourth year as ecretary of education. But he didfind some encouraging signs.   ``Last year a greater proportion of students took the ACT andSAT tests and the Advanced Placement exams than ever before,'' hesaid. That ``means we are succeeding in keeping scores leveldespite a larger pool of test-takers.''   The percentage of high school graduates taking AdvancedPlacement tests has doubled since 1982, from less than 5 percent tonearly 10 percent. Minority participation has grown by 78 percentsince 1984, double the increase among whites.   Test results ``show that poor, black and Hispanic children areperforming better,'' said Bennett, although there is still a widegap between minority and majority scores on the college entrancetests.   Bennett said that since 1976 black students' scores on the SAThave risen by 42 points to 728, while white students' scores felleight points to 936.   He singled out South Carolina as a state that has made progressin setting high academic expectations, holding educatorsaccountable and encouraging parental choice.   Although South Carolina ranks last in SAT scores among the 22states where that is the dominant test, its scores have risen 17points in two years to an average of 832.</TEXT></DOC>
