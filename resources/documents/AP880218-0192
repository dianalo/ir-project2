Third District Judge Kenneth Rigtrup said that jurors were``inflamed with passion'' when they recently made the award to MaeL. Roberts of Holladay.   ``The award of $10 million appears to be disproportionate andunreasonable,'' Rigtrup said at a post-trial hearing. He awarded$75,000 in compensatory and $300,000 in punitive damages.   Roberts was struck in the eye when an aluminum twist cap blewoff a 7-Up bottle she was opening. As a result of the injury, thesight in Roberts' left eye was impaired.   Rigtrup said Roberts could accept his judgment, request a newtrial within 15 days or appeal the decision.   Although there was no evidence that Roberts' means of supportwas damaged by the accident, the judge said, 7-Up's actionswarranted a judgment for significant injury to her eye.   The company knew of the potential danger caused by the bottlecaps since the late 1960s and has ``irresponsibly'' not remediedthe problem, Rigtrup said.   In arguing for 7-Up, Robert Henderson said new owners andmanagement are concerned about the bottle cap problem and havetaken steps to address the issue, but solutions do not come swiftly.   He said between 1986 and 1988 the company knew of only oneincident in which someone was injured with a bottle cap.   Henderson acknowledged 7-Up is partly to blame for the accident,but the fact that Roberts' was attempting to open the bottle withpliers shows that she also was at fault.   Defense attorney Colin King said he will discuss the possibilityof an appeal and said his ``spunky'' client just may seek a newtrial, despite her age.   ``I'm as shocked about the judge's decision as I was with 7-Up'srefusal to adjust the problem (caused by unsafe bottle caps),''Roberts said. ``This is a sad day for consumers.''</TEXT></DOC>
