OVERVIEW AND BACKGROUND </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter 1 </ITAG>Overview <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Introduction </ITAG>Section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code \1\<NOTE/> authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to allocate income,deductions, and other tax items among related taxpayers to prevent evasionof taxes or to reflect their incomes clearly. The Tax Reform Act of 1986[hereinafter 1986 Act] amended section 482 for the first time in many yearsby providing that the income from a transfer or license of intangible propertymust be commensurate with the income attributable to the intangible. TheConference Committee report stated:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Unless otherwise stated, all references to sections andregulations are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the regulationspromulgated thereunder. <ITAG tagnum="21">The conferees are also aware that many important and difficult issuesunder section 482 are left unresolved by this legislation. The confereesbelieve that a comprehensive study of intercompany pricing rules by theInternal Revenue Service should be conducted and that careful considerationshould be given to whether the existing regulations could be modified inany respect.\2\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 841, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. II-638 (1986)[hereinafter 1986 Conf. Rep.]. In response to this recommendation, the Internal Revenue Service and theTreasury Department have reexamined the theory and administration of section482, with particular attention paid to transfers of intangible property.This study presents the findings and recommendations of the Service andTreasury. The study is divided into four parts. Part I recounts the history of section482 and the evolution of issues leading to the 1986 amendments. Part Ialso contains recommendations and suggestions for further considerationto assure both thoughtful analysis by taxpayers in setting transfer pricesand disclosure of information to permit adequate development of transferpricing issues on examination. The problems that have been encountered in relation to transfers of intangibleproperty are both legal and administrative. The 1986 Act clarifies thelegal standard for determining arm's length pricing by stating that transferprices for intangible property must be ``commensurate with income.'' PartII discusses Congress' 1986 change to section 482 and explains that thisstandard requires periodic, and generally prospective, adjustments to transferprices to reflect significant changes in  the income attributable to intangibleproperty. In any event, transfer prices must be determined on the basisof true comparables if they in fact exist. Part II concludes that the commensuratewith income standard is fully consistent with the arm's length principle.The primary administrative difficulty relating to transfers of intangibleproperty is the failure of the regulations to specify a so-called fourthmethod of income allocation for situations in which comparable transactionsdo not exist. This problem has been particularly acute with respect tohigh profit intangibles. Part III of the study explores the economic theoryunderlying section 482 and proposes a methodology for allocating income,and thereby determining transfer prices in such cases, which draws uponvarious methods that have been used on an ad hoc basis by the Service,taxpayers, and the courts. The methodology would utilize functional analysisand allocate income by using comparable transactions when they exist, arm'slength rates of return when comparables do not exist, and a profit splitapproach when neither comparables nor arm's length rates of return canbe used to allocate all intangible income. Part IV examines cost sharing arrangements and relevant implications arisingfrom the 1986 legislation. The specific chapters in each part and the appendices to the study aredescribed below.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Part I: Background </ITAG>Chapter 2 reviews the history of particular transfer pricing legislationand regulations before 1986, including regulations promulgated in 1968,which are still in effect today. Chapter 3 discusses administrative problems. This chapter is supplementedby a survey of selected International Examiners and Group Managers, summarizedin Appendices A and B, which sought information about how the section 482regulations work in practice. Significant problems include access to pricinginformation and difficulties in applying pricing methods to transfers ofintangible assets. The chapter includes recommendations regarding the maintenanceof transfer pricing information in the taxpayer's books and records, whichwould be required to be provided to the IRS immediately upon request inan examination, summary reporting of the taxpayer's transfer pricing methodologyon Forms 5471 and 5472, and the assertion of appropriate penalties forfailure to disclose information or for substantial understatements of income.The regulations place strong emphasis on finding comparable unrelated partytransactions as a guide for evaluating related party transactions. Chapter4 discusses the search for comparables in the decided cases, and concludesthat comparables are often either absent or misused when transfers of intangibleproperty are at issue. The regulations provide that, when comparables are unavailable, some otherappropriate method of allocating income among related parties may be used.Chapter 5 examines the decided cases to see what other methods have beenused, including profit splits, rates of return, income to expense ratios,and customs valuations. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Part II: Section 482 After the 1986 Tax Reform Act </ITAG>Chapter 6 focuses on the ``commensurate with income'' standard incorporatedinto section 482 by the 1986 Act. After describing the legislative history,the chapter discusses limitations some have suggested on the scope of thestandard, and explains its application to normal profit potential intangiblesas well as to high profit potential intangibles. Chapter 7 addresses an issue of major concern to the foreign trading partnersof the United States: compatibility with international transfer pricingstandards. The chapter concludes that the arm's length standard is theaccepted international norm for making transfer pricing adjustments. Thestudy reaffirms that Congress intended the commensurate with income standardto be consistent with the arm's length standard, and that it will be sointerpreted and applied by the Internal Revenue Service and the TreasuryDepartment. Chapter 8 discusses the need under the commensurate with income standardto make periodic adjustments to intangible income allocations. Recommendationsaddress the issues of the frequency of review, retroactivity, lump sumpayments, and set-offs. Taxpayers and practitioners have long advocated safe harbors as a solutionto many of the problems arising under section 482. Chapter 9 discussessafe harbors in theory and analyzes some of the safe harbors that havebeen proposed. While the Service and Treasury do not categorically rejectthe possibility that some useful safe harbors might be developed, noneof those currently proposed appears satisfactory. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Part III: Methods for Valuing Transfers of Intangibles </ITAG>The current regulations adopt a market-based approach, distributing incomeamong related parties the way a free market would distribute it among unrelatedparties. Some critics have suggested that a unitary business approach,eliminating the fiction of arm's length dealing and accounting for economiesof related party dealing through a formulary method, might be more theoreticallysound. Chapter 10 examines these arguments and concludes that the market-basedarm's length standard remains the better theoretical allocation method.Chapter 11 discusses the formulation of a methodology for applying thearm's length standard to transfers of intangible property. Beginning witha discussion of the use of exact and inexact comparables, the chapter proposesas an additional method an arm's length return method that, with appropriateadjustments, could be used in a large percentage of cases. For cases involvingintangibles in which comparables and the arm's length return method cannotaccount for all income to be allocated, a profit split addition to thearm's length return method is described. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Part IV: Cost Sharing Arrangements </ITAG>Chapter 12 presents a description of cost sharing arrangements and describesthe history of their tax treatment, comparing the detailed section 482cost sharing regulations that were proposed in 1966 with the terse versionactually promulgated in 1968. The chapter reviews foreign experience withcost sharing, a 1984 Congressional recommendation that the cost sharingrules be expanded, and the special rules governing cost sharing arrangementsbetween possessions corporations and their domestic affiliates.The legislative history regarding the change to section 482 in the 1986Act states that Congress intended to permit bona fide cost sharing arrangements,but expected the economic results of such arrangements to be consistentwith the commensurate with income standard. Chapter 13 identifies and discussesvarious issues related to the use of cost sharing arrangements after the1986 Act. <ITAG tagnum="81">F. Appendices </ITAG>Appendices A and B to the study summarize the results of a survey of Servicepersonnel about the administration of section 482. Appendix C analyzesthe transfer pricing law and practices of selected jurisdictions. AppendixD describes the publicly available information about third party licensingpractices. Appendix E contains 14 examples that illustrate how the principlesexplained in the study are applied in different factual contexts. <ITAG tagnum="81">G. Future Agenda </ITAG>This study reflects input from taxpayer groups, practitioners, and otherconcerned members of the public, as well as the combined experience andcareful thought of those in the government charged with enforcing section482. Nevertheless, it is only a beginning; it sets forth conclusions andrecommendations in some areas, and describes the need for further studyin others. In the study, input is requested on specific issues from taxpayers andpractitioners. More generally, however, readers are urged to provide anycomments that would be useful in formulating a fair and workable systemof administering a statute that has challenged taxpayers and the governmentalike. It is anticipated that comments will be taken into account in draftingproposed regulations and in examining additional issues not discussed inthis study_including such areas as the services portion of the section482 regulations, the impact of currency fluctuations on transfer pricing,a more detailed review of functional analysis, and the proper methodologyfor valuing assets under the various ``fourth method'' approaches describedin Chapter 11. Comments should be forwarded in triplicate to the Office of Associate ChiefCounsel (International), Branch 1, 950 L'Enfant Plaza South SW., Room 3319,Washington, DC 20024. Comments are requested to be filed by February 15,1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter 2 </ITAG>Transfer Pricing Law and Regulations Before 1986 <ITAG tagnum="81">A.

When the predecessor to current section 482 was incorporated into the 1928Revenue Act (as section 45), the provision was removed from the expiringconsolidated return provisions and significantly expanded.\6\<NOTE/> The Commissioner's authority to make an adjustment undersection 45 was expressly predicated upon his duty to prevent tax avoidanceand to ensure the clear reflection of the income of the related parties(to determine their ``true tax liability,'' in the words of the legislativehistory).\7\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Rev.

Regulations and the Courts_Through the Early 1960s </ITAG>For many years, the small number of United States companies with multinationalaffiliates meant that section 482 had little impact in the internationalcontext. Prior to the early 1960s, the primary focus of the Service's enforcementefforts using section 482 was domestic. Regulations issued in 1935 \8\<NOTE/> (under section 45) remained in effect substantially unchangeduntil 1968. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Treas. Reg. 86, section 45-1(b) (1935). The regulations set forth the arm's length standard as the fundamentalprinciple underlying section 482: ``The standard to be applied in everycase is that of an uncontrolled taxpayer dealing at arm's length with anotheruncontrolled taxpayer.'' \9\<NOTE/> They did not, however, mandate the use of any particularallocation method. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ <T3>Id. </T3>The case law interpreting section 482 and its predecessors took a broadapproach. The concepts of ``evasion of taxes'' \10\<NOTE/> and ``clear reflection of income'' \11\<NOTE/> were developed into far-reaching weapons to attack a varietyof tax abuses. The predecessors of section 482 were used to prevent recognitionof a tax loss on securities following a tax-free transfer from the corporationthat had incurred, but could not use, the loss,\12\<NOTE/> and to prevent the mismatching of the expenses incurred byone corporation in growing crops from the income artificially realizedby another corporation from harvesting and selling those crops.\13\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ <T3>Asiatic Petroleum Co. v.

U.S., </T3>305 F.2d 681 (9th Cir. 1962). The courts applied a number of different standards for determining whentransactions were conducted at arm's length. Transactions were scrutinizedto determine if related parties received full, fair value,\14\<NOTE/> a fair and reasonable price,\15\<NOTE/> or a fair price including a reasonable profit.\16\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ <T3>Friedlander Corp. v.

Before 1964, it was generally understood that section 482 could not beused by the Service to place taxpayers, in effect, on a consolidated returnbasis.\17\<NOTE/> In 1964, the Tax Court used section 482 to combine the incomesof two separate corporations that operated a downtown clothing store andits suburban branch store.\18\<NOTE/> This case raised concerns among taxpayers over the use ofsection 482 in substance to ignore separate corporate entities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ <T3>Seminole Flavor Co. v. Comm'r, </T3>4 T.C. 1215 (1945); <T3>cf. Moline Properties v. Comm'r, </T3>319 U.S. 436 (1943). In extremecases of income shifting, other legal theories such as assignment of income,substance over form, disregard of corporate entity, or treatment of corporateentity as an agent have been used by courts to attribute income to theappropriate person or corporate entity. These theories are beyond the scopeof this paper, and they are generally not used by courts when section 482is also applicable. <T3>See, e.g., Hospital Corporation of America v. Comm'r, </T3>81 T.C.520 (1983) (foreign affiliate not treated as a sham; section 482 appliedfor use of U.S. parent's intangibles). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ <T3>Hamburgers York Road, Inc. v.

Developments in the 1960s </ITAG>By the early 1960s, the business and regulatory climate in which U.S. andforeign multinationals operated changed substantially. In 1961, the TreasuryDepartment urged that significant changes be made in the taxation of U.S.enterprises with foreign affiliates. In particular, Treasury contendedthat section 482 was not effectively protecting U.S. taxing jurisdiction.\19\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ <T3>Hearings on the President's 1961 Tax Recommendations Before the Committeeon Ways and Means, </T3>87th Cong., 1st Sess., vol. 4, at 3549 (1961) (statementof M. Caplin, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, ``Problems in the Administrationof the Revenue Laws relating to the Taxation of Foreign Income'').  In 1962, Congress considered how to stop U.S. companies from shifting U.S.income to their foreign subsidiaries.\20\<NOTE/> While the Ways and Means Committee observed that under existinglaw the Service could prevent this practice by allocating income undersection 482, it proposed further legislation to minimize ``the difficultiesin determining a fair price,'' particularly in instances ``where thereare thousands of different transactions engaged in between a domestic companyand its foreign subsidiary.'' \21\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ H.R.

No. 1447, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 28 (1962). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ <T3>Id. </T3>The Ways and Means Committee proposal as adopted by the  House would haveadded to section 482 a new subsection dealing with sales of tangible propertybetween U.S. corporations and their foreign corporate affiliates.\22\<NOTE/> Unless the taxpayer could demonstrate its use of an arm'slength price under the comparable uncontrolled price method, taxable incomewas to be apportioned between related parties under a formula based ontheir relative economic activities. In addition, no income was to be allocatedto a ``foreign organization whose assets, personnel, and office and otherfacilities which are not attributable to the United States are grosslyinadequate for its activities outside the United States.'' \23\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ H.R. 10650, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., section 6 (1962). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ <T3>Id.; see </T3>H.R. Rep. No. 1447, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 537-38 (1962). The Senate version of the 1962 Revenue Bill, which prevailed in conference,omitted the House provision. Instead, the Finance Committee concluded thatsection 482 already provided ample regulatory authority to prevent impropermultinational allocations.\24\<NOTE/> The Conference Committee endorsed this approach, stating:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ <T3>See, e.g., Hearings on H.R. 10650 Before the Senate Committee on Finance,</T3>87th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 7, at 2913, 3011-3012 (1962) (statementsby P.

Adams).  <ITAG tagnum="21">The conferees on the part of both the House and the Senate believethat the objectives of section 6 of the bill as passed by the House canbe accomplished by amendment of the regulations under present section 482. Section 482 already contains broad authority to the Secretary of the Treasuryor his delegate to allocate income and deductions. It is believed thatthe Treasury should explore the possibility of developing and promulgatingregulations under this authority which would provide additional guidelinesand formulas for the allocation of income and deductions in cases involvingforeign income.\25\<NOTE/> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ H.R. Rep. No. 2508, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 18-19 (1962). <ITAG tagnum="81">D. The Current Regulations </ITAG>Treasury responded by promulgating regulations, issued in final form in1968, that (with only a few changes) govern transfer pricing practicestoday.\26\<NOTE/> Those regulations reaffirmed the arm's length standard asthe principal basis for transfer pricing adjustments but attempted, forthe first time, to establish rules for specific kinds of intercompany transactions.The final regulations applied to the performance of services, the licensingor sale of intangible property, and the sale of tangible property.\27\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ Proposed regulations were issued in 1965, were withdrawnand reproposed in 1966, and were issued in final form in 1968.

Reg. andSection; 1.482-2(a), and rulessimilar to the services rules for related party leasing transactions, Treas.Reg. andSection; 1.482-2(c). These rules are generally not discussed in thispaper. 1. <T3>Services. </T3>In determining an arm's length charge for services,andSection; 1.482-2(b)(3) of the regulations provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">For the purpose of this paragraph an arm's length charge for servicesrendered shall be the amount which was charged or would have been chargedfor the same or similar services in independent transactions with or betweenunrelated parties under similar circumstances considering all relevantfacts.</ITAG>The regulations do not provide any specific guidance for determining whatthe charge in independent transactions would have been in the absence ofcomparable transactions with independent parties. 2. <T3>Intangible property. </T3>As to the licensing or sale of intangibleproperty, andSection; 1.482-2(d)(2)(ii) of the regulations provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">In determining the amount of an arm's length consideration, the standardto be applied is the amount that would have been paid by an unrelated partyfor the same intangible property under the same circumstances. Where therehave been transfers by the transferor to unrelated parties involving thesame or similar intangible property under the same or similar circumstancesthe amount of the consideration for such transfers shall generally be thebest indication of an arm's length consideration.</ITAG>The intangible property portion of the regulations contemplate a failureto find appropriate comparables. Where they are unavailable, the regulationslist 12 factors to be taken into account, including prevailing rates inthe industry, offers of competitors, the uniqueness of the property andits legal protection, prospective profits to be generated by the intangible,and required investments necessary to utilize the intangible.\28\<NOTE/> The regulation offers little or no guidance, however, indetermining how much relative importance particular factors are to be given.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ Treas.

Section 1.482-2(e)(2)(4) of the regulations describes three specificmethods for determining an appropriate arm's length price: The comparableuncontrolled price method, the resale price method, and the cost plus method.All three rely on comparable transactions to determine an arm's lengthprice, either directly or by reference to appropriate markups in comparableunrelated transactions. The regulations mandate that the three enumeratedmethods be used in the order set forth. They also authorize other unspecifiedmethods, which have come to be known generically as ``fourth methods'':<ITAG tagnum="21">Where none of the three methods of pricing * * * can reasonably beapplied under the facts and circumstances as they exist in a particularcase, <T3>some appropriate method of pricing </T3>other than those describedin subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, or variations on such methods,can be used. [Emphasis supplied.] \29\<NOTE/> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.482-2(e)(1)(iii). The specific transaction-oriented models described above for  making transferpricing determinations were adopted in lieu of ``mechanical safe havens''based on profit margins, percentage mark-ups or mark-downs, and the like,which had been suggested by various taxpayers commenting on proposed regulationsissued in 1965 and 1966. Such safe harbors were rejected for two reasons.First, because of the extraordinary range of returns earned at arm's length,even within a single industry or company, no principled and equitable basisfor such safe harbors could be devised. Second, any effective safe harborincome allocation would inevitably serve as a ``floor,'' applying onlyto those taxpayers not able to document a more advantageous fact pattern.\30\<NOTE/> As discussed in Chapter 9, <T3>infra, </T3>the concerns raised by safe harbors still have not beensatisfactorily dispelled. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ Surrey, <T3>Treasury's Need to Curb Tax Avoidance in Foreign Business through theUse of Section 482, </T3>28 J. Tax'n 75 (1968). <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Conclusion </ITAG>In general, the section 482 regulations relating to services, intangibleproperty, and tangible property rely heavily on finding comparable transferprices or comparable transactions. The regulations provide little guidancefor determining transfer prices in the absence of comparables. <ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter 3 </ITAG>Recent Service Experience in Administering Section 482 In order to determine what difficulties International Examiners are encounteringin administering the regulations, a questionnaire was prepared throughthe joint efforts of Treasury, Chief Counsel, and International Examinationpersonnel. The questionnaire was sent to selected International Examiners(IEs) and IE Group Managers. In addition, selected IRS economists, IEs,Group Managers, and IRS trial attorneys were interviewed. The results of the analysis of the questionnaires have been compiled andare set forth in Appendix A. Included in Appendix B is a completed questionnairereflecting the aggregate data supplied by the respondents.\31\<NOTE/> In general, the survey and interviews revealed no surprises.The two primary problems in   administering section 482 have been the difficultyof obtaining pricing information from the taxpayers during an examinationand the difficulty of valuing intangibles_including the valuation of intangibleproperty in connection with sales of tangible property. This chapter discussesthese problems, makes several related suggestions regarding disclosureof information and penalties, and suggests that the early use of counseland economic experts would alleviate these problems.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ IEs and Group Managers were requested to complete onequestionnaire for each of the three cases they considered to be their mostimportant section 482 cases. In some instances respondents had not hadexperience with three important section 482 cases, so that fewer responseswere made to some questions. In others, some respondents answered basedon their general experience, rather than the particular case for whichthe questionnaire was completed. In many instances the categorization ofparticular issues entails a great deal of judgment. For example, a casesuch as <T3>Hospital Corporation of America, supra </T3>n. 17, could be viewedas a services case, an allocation of income case, a profit split case,or an intangibles case. For these reasons we have used the results of thequestionnaire throughout this paper primarily for purposes of illustration.However, the results, where used, represent and correspond with the experiencesof persons interviewed and others in the Service responsible for administeringsection 482. <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Service's Access to Pricing Information </ITAG>A significant threshold problem in the examination of section 482 caseshas been IRS access to relevant information to make pricing determinations.In some cases, relevant information is not furnished by the taxpayer tothe examining agent.\32\<NOTE/> In other cases, long delays are experienced by agents inreceiving information, in most cases without explanation for the delays.In many cases, delays in responding to IE requests for information exceedone year.\33\<NOTE/> Because of the emphasis upon timely closing of large casesin the recent past, section 482 cases have been closed without receivingnecessary information or without the opportunity for agents to follow upon information that has been provided.\34\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ Many of the requests for information that are not honoredconcern transactions with third parties that would provide comparablesfor analyzing a potential section 482 adjustment.

In recent years the Service has placed an emphasis on examination of transactionswith subsidiaries located in tax haven jurisdictions.\36\<NOTE/> Because of the financial and commercial secrecy laws thatexist in tax haven jurisdictions, IRS access to third party data has beensignificantly hampered. Problems with access to information because offoreign secrecy laws have been to some extent alleviated by the enactmentof section 982 \37\<NOTE/> and by a broad interpretation of the IRS administrative summonspower    by the courts.\38\<NOTE/> However, as will be subsequently discussed, agents have failedto use the section 982 and administrative summons procedures aggressively.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ General Accounting Office, Report to the Chairman, Committeeon Ways and Means, <T3>IRS Audit Coverage: Selection Procedures Same for Foreign and otherU.S. Corporations </T3>26-29 (1986) [hereinafter GAO, <T3>IRS Audit Coverage</T3>]. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\37\ Under section 982, a taxpayer which, without reasonablecause, fails to produce, within 90 days, foreign based documents soughtby the agent during the course of the examination through the use of aformal document request may be precluded from introducing the documentssought in a subsequent court proceeding.

In practice, examinations of United States subsidiaries of foreign parentshave developed into some of the Service's most difficult examinations.A primary reason for the difficulty is that agents are unable to obtaintimely access to necessary data, which is typically in the hands of theparent company. In  many cases, foreign parent companies refuse to producethis information upon request. An additional difficulty encountered byagents is that foreign parent corporations may not be subject to informationreporting requirements similar to U.S. requirements.\41\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ Wheeler, <T3>SEC Requires Less Disclosure from Foreign Corporations, </T3>Tax Notes,October 12, 1987, at 195-197. Both the administrative summons procedures \42\<NOTE/> and the formal document request procedures \43\<NOTE/> are tools that are available to IEs to compel productionof information necessary to determine whether a section 482 adjustmentis appropriate. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, IEs seldom serveadministrative summonses or section 982 requests.\44\<NOTE/> The most common reason given for failing to use these proceduresis the time delay necessary to follow them, which conflicts with the needto close the examination. Another reason given in many cases was the necessityof maintaining a good working relationship with the taxpayer, which IEsfeared would be harmed if these procedures were used.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ Section 7602; <T3>United States v.

Appendix B, <T3>infra, </T3>at Questions 21, 22.Although section 6001 contains a general requirement that a taxpayer maintainadequate books and records, the section 482 regulations are generally silentwith regard to records and their accessibility to either support or todetermine arm's length prices.\45\<NOTE/> Thus, the current regulations do not advise taxpayers specificallyof the type of information that is necessary in order to determine compliancewith section 482. Specific information on transactions between parent andsubsidiary corporations is required on forms 5471 and 5472, which havebeen widely used by agents in planning and conducting section 482 examinations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ An exception in Treas.

Service experience has been that many taxpayers do not rely upon any formof comparable transactions or other contemporaneous information eitherin planning or in defending intercompany transactions.\46\<NOTE/> Although the legislative history to the 1986 Act expressesconcern that industry average royalty rates are used by taxpayers to justifyroyalties for high profit intangibles,\47\<NOTE/> the more serious problem has been that the taxpayer, nothaving structured the transaction with any comparable in mind, seeks to defend its position by finding whatever transaction or method gets closestto the transfer price initially chosen, whether that be an industry averagerate of return or some other type of comparable. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ Appendix B, <T3>infra, </T3>at Question 57. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\47\ H.R. Rep. No. 426, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 424 (1985) [hereinafter1985 House Rep.]. The survey revealed that in approximately 41% of thecases in which taxpayers relied upon comparables, industry averages wereused. Appendix A, <T3>infra.  </T3>Problems related to information and aggressive return positions would bealleviated if the regulations specifically set out a taxpayer's responsibilityto document the methodology used in establishing intercompany transferprices prior to filing the tax return and to require that such documentationbe provided within a reasonable time after request. The documentation shouldinclude references to any comparable transactions, rates of return, profitsplits, or other information or analyses used by the taxpayer in arrivingat transfer prices. In general, a taxpayer making relatively minor investmentswould not be required to obtain information regarding comparable transactionsoutside of its own knowledge of its business affairs and those of its competitors,but to use information and analyses that generally would have been producedby the taxpayer in the course of developing its business plan. However,a taxpayer engaging in a major transaction or one involved in a complexprofit split analysis involving significant high profit intangibles \48\<NOTE/> would be expected to gather and analyze the types of informationillustrated by the examples in Appendix E which, once again, is informationlikely to be produced by the taxpayer in developing  its business plan.In the absence of comparables, taxpayers should be required at a minimumto apply a rate of return analysis or profit split methodology that maybe prescribed in regulations under which the taxpayer would identify assetsand functions performed by it and its affiliates and identify the rateof return or profit split that the taxpayer believes should be assignedor allocated to each activity or function. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\48\ <T3>See </T3>discussion <T3>infra </T3>Chapter 11. Furthermore, Forms 5471 and 5472 should be revised to include summary informationdescribing how intercompany prices were determined and an attestation thatthe documentation required to be maintained under the section 482 regulations,as described above, was available at the time of preparation of the returnand will be made available at the start of an IRS examination. Requiringinformation to be made available at the beginning of an audit would alleviateproblems of receiving either too little or too much information near theexpiration of the statute of limitations. The Service and Treasury believe that taxpayer compliance in the transferpricing area with respect both to disclosure of information and to conformitywith the arm's length standard would be enhanced by the proper assertionof appropriate penalties. While the penalty imposed by section 6661 forsubstantial understatement of tax can apply, to date the Service has onlyinfrequently imposed penalties in connection with making section 482 adjustments.\49\<NOTE/> The lnternal Revenue Service is currently engaged in a comprehensivestudy of the role of civil tax penalties,\50\<NOTE/> as are many other interested parties. It, therefore, seemstimely to focus now on the effectiveness of existing penalties in encouragingcompliant taxpayer behavior and penalizing unjustified positions in thetransfer pricing area. Consideration should be given to when the section6661 penalty should be raised and whether it is adequate to deter instanceswhere taxpayers do not make intercompany pricing decisions upon a reasonablebasis, or whether a new penalty should be proposed. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\49\ Under Rev. Proc. 88-37, 1988-30 I.R.B. 31, a taxpayerthat reports intercompany transactions, on Schedules G and M of Form 5471,may avoid the substantial understatement penalty. <T3>See </T3>Rev. Proc. 85-26, 1985-1 C.B. 580 (amended returns or statementsmade following commencement of a CEP examination may avoid assertion ofthe substantial understatement penalty). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\50\ Commissioner's Penalty Study, <T3>A Philosophy of Civil Tax Penalties </T3>(discussion draft June 8,1988). The Service and Treasury are interested in recommendations in this area,including such specific comments as to the type and amount of penalties,and whether there should be certain transaction oriented thresholds thatought to apply before any penalty could be asserted. For example, a transactionspecific penalty (similar to the overvaluation penalty of section 6659)may be an appropriate means of deterring substantial deviations from thecommensurate with income standard. Specific consideration should be givento whether the applicable penalty provisions should be amended to applyif there is a substantial  deviation from the appropriate commensuratewith income payment regardless of whether there is disclosure on the taxreturn of the manner in which taxpayers computed transfer prices. Disclosureof the taxpayer's method of computing a transfer price can not adequatelyinform the Service as to whether such a transfer price substantially deviatesfrom the appropriate section 482 transfer price absent a thorough audit.Consequently, such disclosure should not prevent the imposition of a penaltyfor substantial deviation from the correct section 482 transfer price.\51\<NOTE/> Since it is possible to use the provisions of section 367(d)to deter abusive situations (<T3>see </T3>discussion of section 367(d) <T3>infra </T3>Chapter 6), it may also be appropriate to clarify how taxpayersmay avoid imposition of penalties in the context of section 367 adjustments.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ <T3>See </T3>discussion of the commensurate with income standard and periodicadjustments <T3>infra </T3>Chapters 6 and 8.  <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Intangibles </ITAG>A significant portion of section 482 adjustments proposed in recent yearshave involved an adjustment for pricing with respect to the licensing orother transfer of intangibles.\52\<NOTE/> Because of the absence of comparables in many cases, intangibletransfers generally are the most problematic of adjustments due to the inherent difficulty of valuing intangibles under the existing regulations.As previously noted in Chapter 2, the intangible property portion of theregulations contemplate a failure to find appropriate comparables and list12 factors to be taken into account in valuing intangibles in the absenceof comparables. No guidance is given, however, in determining the relativeimportance of particular factors.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ In the survey conducted for the study, an adjustmentwas made under Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.482-2(d) in about 50% of the reportedcases. Appendix B, <T3>infra, </T3>at Question 68.In a significant number of cases, IEs relied upon sections of the regulationsother than the intangibles portion to make a transfer pricing adjustment.\53\<NOTE/> Intangibles are often transferred by incorporation into tangibleproperty that is sold or rented. In these types of cases, the taxpayershave not been required to isolate the value of the intangible.\54\<NOTE/> Incorporating a return on an intangible in a transfer pricefor tangible property does not alleviate, however, the difficulty of valuingthe intangible. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ In approximately 40% of the cases reported in the survey,IEs cited the inability to value an intangible as the reason why they failedto follow the intangibles section of the regulations.

A common example is the transfer of tangible property with a trademark,trade name, or recognizable logo attached. It is clear from the regulationsthat a trademark, trade name, or logo is an intangible.\55\<NOTE/> The regulations governing the sales of tangible propertyspecify that, in applying the comparable uncontrolled price, resale price,and cost plus methods, adjustments must be made for sales with or withouttrademarks, provided there is a reasonably ascertainable effect on theprice.\56\<NOTE/> In some cases adjustments for trademarks are relatively easyto make. The analysis, however, becomes much more complex if there areno similar products sold (with or without trademarks) on which to basea comparison. Setting a transfer price for a product in such a case involvesthe same difficult exercise as setting a royalty rate for a licensed intangible.One of the recent pharmaceutical cases presents an example of this lattersituation since it involved the sale of unique pharmaceutical products.\57\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ Treas.

In some circumstances,taxpayers have attempted to shift large amounts of income to tax havensubsidiaries by ``loaning'' a few key employees to a tax haven affiliate.By loaning employees, the parent company may simultaneously provide servicesand transfer valuable intangible know-how. In transactions which are structuredas an intangibles transfer, it is difficult to value services renderedin connection with the transfer of intangible property, which may be necessaryfor purposes of determining the source of the income.\58\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\58\ In certain circumstances, no separate allocation is requiredfor services performed in connection with the transfer of intangible property.Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.482-2(b)(8). Services are rendered in connectionwith the transfer of intangible property if they are merely ancillary orsubsidiary to the transfer of the intangible property. The regulationsgive as an example of ancillary services start-up help given to a relatedentity in order for it to integrate a trade secret manufacturing processinto its operations. The regulations then state that, should the transferorcontinue to render services after the process has been integrated intothe manufacturing process, a separate allocation for services would berequired under the regulations. The experience of the IEs is that the currentregulations fail to give them specific guidance on how to determine whenservices rendered in connection with the transfer of an intangible requirea separate allocation. <ITAG tagnum="28">Appendix D discusses results of a preliminary survey of data availableat the SEC. This data has the potential to determine when unrelated partieswould extract a specific charge for services rendered in connection withthe transfer of an intangible. </ITAG>A particularly difficult aspect of valuing intangibles has been determiningwhat part of an intangible profit is due to manufacturing intangibles andwhat part is due to marketing intangibles.\59\<NOTE/> This problem has particular significance in section 936,since the possessions corporation is generally entitled to a return onlyon manufacturing intangibles when it elects the cost sharing method undersection 936(h). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\59\ In <T3>Lilly, </T3><T3>supra </T3>n. 57, the Tax Court ultimately determined the parent company'smarketing return based upon using its ``best judgment.'' <T3>Lilly, </T3>84 T.C. at 1167; <T3>See also G. D. Searle and Co. v. Comm'r [Searle], </T3>88 T.C. 252,376 (1987). Problems with intangibles underlie the amendment made to section 482 bythe 1986 Act, as discussed in Part II. The intangibles section of the section482 regulations should be modified to provide a specific analysis to beused when comparable uncontrolled transactions do not exist. The methodshould provide for appropriate allocations of income when multiple intangibles(such as marketing and manufacturing intangibles) are present in the sameset of transactions. Part III is devoted to the subject of an appropriatemethodology for allocating intangible income. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Application of Pricing Methods for Transfers of Tangible Property</ITAG>When considering an adjustment with respect to the transfer price for tangibleproperty, the regulations require both the taxpayer and the Service tofollow a priority of pricing methods: first, the comparable uncontrolledprice method must be attempted, then resale price method, then cost plusmethod, and, if none of them are applicable, some other method or combinationof the prior methods.\60\<NOTE/> Five prior studies using data available from both the Serviceand multinational corporations have examined the frequency with which eachof these methods has been used.

For a significant number of cases, these transactions canbe found, although frequently not without a great deal of ingenuity andpersistence by the examining agent or other Service personnel.\67\<NOTE/> If comparable uncontrolled prices do not exist, IEs or Serviceeconomists will seek to locate comparable transactions based on functionsperformed and risks borne by the entity at issue. This type of an issuelends itself to resale price or cost plus, depending upon the circumstances.If neither comparable uncontrolled prices nor comparable uncontrolled transactionscan be found, a variety of fourth methods may be used. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\67\ Appendix B, <T3>infra, </T3>at Questions 62-64. One justification given for the current priority of methods in the regulationsis that both the taxpayer and the Service are thus directed to a commonframe of analysis to avoid the problem of the Service using one methodwhile the taxpayer uses another method. However, as currently structured,the regulations literally require that both the taxpayer and the agentattempt to apply the methods in priority order. Because the resale pricemethod generally applies only to distributors of goods, while the costplus method applies generally to manufacturers, there does not seem tobe any reason in theory why the agent or taxpayer  should attempt to applythe resale price method before applying the cost plus method.\68\<NOTE/> In practice, taxpayers and agents rely upon comparable uncontrolledprices or transactions, when they exist. When they do not exist, agentsor taxpayers use whatever method they believe best reflects the economicrealities of the transaction at issue. While there are valid theoreticalreasons for retaining the priority of the comparable uncontrolled pricemethod,\69\<NOTE/> there do not seem to be any valid reasons for preferringresale price over cost plus or another method, or for preferring resaleprice or cost plus over some other economically sound method. Rather, themethod used should generally be the one for which the best data is availableand for which the fewest number of adjustments are required. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\68\ In <T3>Lilly, supra </T3>n. 57, the IRS notice of deficiency was based uponthe cost plus method while the taxpayer initially attempted to rely uponthe resale price method. The Tax Court rejected application of the costplus method and, also, the taxpayer's analysis under both the resale priceand ``fourth'' methods. It ultimately adopted a profit split method forthe first two years at issue and a CUP method for the final year. <T3>See </T3>discussion of <T3>Lilly infra </T3>Chapters 4 and 5. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\69\ <T3>See </T3>discussion of this issue <T3>infra </T3>Chapter 11. One technique that is missing from the section 482 regulations that inpractice is used extensively by the international examiners is functionalanalysis. This analysis focuses on the economic functions performed bythe affiliated parties to a transaction and the economic risks borne byeach of the parties.\70\<NOTE/> This technique is used by IEs and Service economists notas a method standing alone but rather as a means of verifying that pricesor transactions are truly comparable to the situation under examinationor as a basis for a fourth method. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\70\ I.R.M. andSection; 4233 (523.2). The Manual states thatalmost all cases can be analyzed using a functional analysis. As discussed in section B, intangibles are often transferred by incorporationinto tangible property that is sold, and setting a transfer price for aproduct in such a case involves the same difficult exercise as settinga royalty rate for a licensed intangible. The difficulty of valuing intangiblesis, therefore, as much a problem in the context of sales of property asin the case of licenses or other transfers of intangibles. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Use of Specialists and Counsel </ITAG>The use of counsel and economic specialists at the examination level wouldameliorate some of the problems, discussed above, of obtaining informationand dealing with difficult intangible pricing cases. Legal assistance duringexamination is needed to assist in obtaining relevant information and indetermining whether an appropriate legal basis exists for a proposed adjustment.Economists are needed in many cases to perform a functional analysis andto help evaluate the proper  returns to be accorded to the related parties.Other experts may be required to analyze practices within the taxpayer'sindustry. The goal of the attorney, the economist, and other specialistsshould be to assist the IE in obtaining all relevant facts and to determinewhether an adjustment may be sustained on appropriate legal and economictheories if the matter ever results in litigation. For section 482 cases developed 10 years ago, it would have been normalfor the IE to develop the case without the assistance of an economist orwithout the assistance of a Chief Counsel attorney. Authority and expertisein international tax matters were then split between the National OfficeExamination function and the Director, Foreign Operations District. Legalexpertise in international tax matters was diffused among at least fournational office divisions and was limited in field offices. In May 1986 the Office of the Assistant Commissioner (International) wascreated to provide an emphasis upon, and a focal point for, developmentof international issues at the examination stage. The Office of AssociateChief Counsel (International) was created in March 1986 to provide a similarfocal point for legal issues. In addition, a network of International SpecialTrial Attorneys and senior District Counsel attorneys has been createdto litigate significant international tax cases, including section 482cases. More importantly, these field attorneys and their National Officecounterparts have been encouraged to assist the field in developing thesecases, and IEs are encouraged to use their assistance.\71\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\71\ I.R.M. andSection; 4233 (524).  Within the last several years, the Service has substantially increasedthe number of economists available to assist IEs and has decentralizedthose activities from the national office to three key District offices:Baltimore, New York, and Chicago. Use of economists in major section 482examinations that do not involve safe harbors is now required.\72\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\72\ I.R.M. andSection; 42 (12)3.  One criticism that has been made concerning the more extensive use of counseland experts at the examination stage is that the time necessary to completean examination (already lengthy) will be further extended. Service experiencehas been, however, that increased use of specialists has not unduly delayeddisposition of the examination in the vast majority of the cases.\73\<NOTE/> Furthermore, the early use of specialists in some cases willprevent erroneous adjustments from ever being made, thus saving both taxpayersand the government substantial sums of time and money. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\73\ Appendix B, <T3>infra, </T3>at Question 32.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Conclusions and Recommendations </ITAG>Access to Pricing Information1. The failure of the taxpayer to document the methodology used to establishtransfer prices under the section 482 regulations and delays or failureby taxpayers in supplying information to IEs are significant problems thathamper the IRS in its administration of section 482. 2. The section 482 regulations are deficient in not requiring taxpayersto document intercompany pricing policies and to supply information uponexamination. The section 482 regulations should be amended to require taxpayersto document the methodology used to establish transfer prices prior tofiling the tax return and to provide such documentation during examinationwithin a reasonable time after request. The documentation should includereferences to any comparable prices or transactions, rates of return, profitsplits or other information or analysis used by the taxpayer in arrivingat the transfer price. 3. Forms 5471 and 5472 should be revised to include: (a) Summary informationdescribing how intercompany prices were determined; and (b) an attestationthat the documentation described in paragraph 2, <T3>supra, </T3>was available at the time of preparation of the returnand will be made available at the start of an IRS examination. 4. IEs experiencing difficulties in obtaining transfer pricing informationhave failed to deal with noncompliant taxpayers through the issuance ofsection 982 requests and administrative summonses. The Service should moreaggressively pursue noncompliant taxpayers that delay, without justification,in producing relevant pricing information by using the section 982 andadministrative summons procedures. 5. The assertion of appropriate penalties is a necessary but often ignoredelement of transfer pricing compliance. In conjunction with the Service'sbroad-based review of penalties, the Government should determine whetherexisting penalties are sufficient to: (a) Compel taxpayers to provide thoroughand accurate information as set forth in paragraphs 2 and 3 <T3>supra</T3>; and (b) deter taxpayers from setting overly aggressiveand unjustified transfer prices that are inconsistent with the commensuratewith income standard. If it is felt that existing penalties are inadequate,legislative solutions should be pursued. The Service and Treasury encouragecomments in this area, including the type of penalty, such as a transactionbased penalty, that might be proposed. Intangibles 6. Establishing appropriate transfer prices for intangibles has been asignificant problem because of the inherent difficulty of valuing intangibles_particularlywhen intangibles are transferred simultaneously with the transfer of tangibleproperty or the provision of services. 7. The intangibles section of the section 482 regulations should be modifiedto provide a specific method of analysis to be used when comparable uncontrolledtransactions do not exist. This method should provide for appropriate allocationwhen multiple intangibles (such as marketing and manufacturing intangibles)are present in the same set of transactions. Part III is devoted to thesubject of an appropriate methodology for allocating intangible income.Application of Pricing Method for Transfers of Tangible Property 8. The current priority for the comparable uncontrolled price method shouldbe retained, since such prices generally provide the best evidence of whatunrelated parties would do in an arm's length transaction. There does notappear to be any reason to retain the current priority of the resale pricemethod over the cost plus method, or for preferring resale price or costplus over some other economically sound method. Rather, the method usedshould generally be the one for which the best data is available and forwhich the fewest number of adjustments are required. 9. Since intangibles are often incorporated into tangible property thatis sold, the difficulty of valuing intangibles is as much of a problemin many transfers of tangible property as in the context of licenses orother transfers of intangible property. Use of Specialists and Counsel 10. The use of counsel and economic specialists at the examination levelwould ameliorate the problems of obtaining information and dealing withthe difficult intangible pricing cases. Chief Counsel attorneys familiarwith transfer pricing issues should be involved in significant cases atan early stage to make sure that relevant information necessary for theexamination is being obtained and that a technical basis for a potentialadjustment exists. An economist needs to be involved at an early stageto perform a functional analysis and to evaluate the proper returns tobe accorded to the related parties. The goal of the attorney, the economist,and other specialists should be to assist the IE in obtaining all relevantfacts and to determine whether an adjustment may be sustained on appropriatelegal and economic theories if the matter ever results in litigation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter 4</ITAG>The Search for Comparables <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Introduction </ITAG>As explained in Chapter 2, the section 482 regulations rely heavily onfinding comparable goods, services, and intangibles to determine whetheran arm's length price has been used. Where such comparables exist_wherearm's length transactions bearing a reasonable economic resemblance tothose being examined have occurred in the free market_application of theregulations is relatively straightforward. Where no comparables can befound, or where similar items are only distantly comparable, the regulationsleave the Service, the taxpayers, and the courts with little guidance.This chapter examines several recent cases decided under section 482 toassess the use of comparables by the parties and the courts, whether inthe context of either sales of tangible property, the provision of services,or licenses or other transfers of intangible property. These cases showthat comparables are often difficult to locate, and may be misused or misinterpretedeven if they are found. In most of the cases discussed in this chapter,no comparables were available. The courts' resolution of the issues inthe absence of comparables is discussed in Chapter 5. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Specific Comparables </ITAG>In recent years, transfer pricing cases involving highly profitable products_whichusually are associated with unique intangibles_have severely tested thecomparables approach of the present section 482 regulations. This problemis illustrated by the <T3>Lilly \77\</T3><NOTE/> case. In <T3>Lilly, </T3>the U.S. parent corporation, Lilly U.S., transferred highlyprofitable manufacturing intangibles, including patents and know-how (primarilyrelating to the drugs Darvon and Darvon-N), to its newly-formed U.S. subsidiaryin Puerto Rico, Lilly P.R., in a tax-free exchange for Lilly P.R. stockunder section 351. The Service took the position that the income associatedwith those intangibles should be allocated to Lilly U.S., notwithstandingtheir tax-free transfer to Lilly P.R. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\77\ <T3>Supra </T3>n. 57. In preparation for trial, the government's experts surveyed the most successfulU.S. pharmaceutical products. They discovered that the patents to suchproducts were rarely transferred, except to a related party. The governmentargued that unrelated parties would not have transferred the Darvon  intangiblesand that, accordingly, there were no comparable marketplace transactions.While the Tax Court did not fully subscribe to the government's theoryof the case, it nevertheless was not able to find appropriate comparablesfor the patented products in question for the first 2 years at issue, 1971and 1972.\78\<NOTE/> The court proceeded to make its own allocations, basing itsadjustments on the proposition that a distortion of income was createdby the transfer of intangibles from Lilly U.S. to Lilly P.R. in exchangefor Lilly P.R. stock. In the Tax Court's view, the distortion arose becauseit felt that Lilly would have demanded a stream of income from the transferredDarvon intangibles in order to fund a proportionate part of its ongoinggeneral research and development efforts. The Tax Court also used a profitsplit approach to increase the return of Lilly U.S. on marketing expendituresand intangibles.\79\<NOTE/> On appeal, the Seventh Circuit rejected the Tax Court's allocationto support research and development, but affirmed its profit split methodology.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\78\ For 1973, the Tax Court was able to use a comparableuncontrolled price approach because the Darvon patent had expired. However,numerous adjustments were made to reach a transfer price. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\79\ <T3>See </T3>discussion of the Tax Court's profit split analysis <T3>infra </T3>Chapter 5.  In <T3>Searle</T3>,\80\<NOTE/> the petitioner transferred the patents (or licenses) on itsmost successful pharmaceutical products to its  U.S. subsidiary, SCO, operatingin Puerto Rico. These intangibles represented products accounting for approximately80 percent of the petitioner's profits and sales. As in <T3>Lilly, </T3>the government argued that a section 482 allocation fromSCO to the petitioner was appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\80\ <T3>Supra </T3>n. 59. The petitioner, relying on andSection; 1.482-2(d)(2)(ii) of the regulations,argued that, since it had originally acquired two of the transferred intangiblesby licensing agreements carrying royalties of ten percent and eight percentof net sales, an unrelated party would not have paid more than a royaltyin this range for the intangible property transferred to SCO. The court,however, found that the original licenses were not comparable; the productswere licensed from European pharmaceutical firms prior to their approvalby the FDA, and thus could not have been marketed in the United Statesat the time of the license. The court concluded that the intangibles toSCO were significantly more valuable than the ``mere licensing agreements''upon which the taxpayer relied.\81\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\81\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 375. Ultimately, the court found, despite the voluminous record, that ``thereis little hard evidence from which we can determine what considerationpetitioner would have demanded had the transactions under scrutiny heretaken place between unrelated parties dealing at arm's length.'' \82\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\82\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 376.  Problems with finding or applying comparables for valuable intangibleshave not been limited to pharmaceutical companies. In <T3>Hospital Corporation of America,</T3>\83\<NOTE/> a U.S. hospital management company, HCA, entered into negotiationsto recruit professional and non-professional staff to manage a state-of-the-arthospital in Saudi Arabia. It formed a Cayman Islands corporation, LTD,ostensibly to negotiate and perform the management contract. HCA performedservices for LTD and made available at little cost all of its know-how,experience, management systems knowledge, and other intangibles. The partiesoffered no evidence of comparable transactions, and the court identifiednone. Nevertheless, the court allocated 25% of the income to LTD as compensationfor its management service. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\83\ <T3>Supra </T3>n. 17.  The Tax Court was also unable to find appropriate comparables in <T3>Ciba-Geigy Corp. v. Comm'r.,</T3>\84\<NOTE/> where the Service sought to reduce royalties paid by a U.S.subsidiary to its foreign parent for the rights to manufacture and sella herbicide. Unlike the approach taken by the courts in <T3>Lilly </T3>for  1973, where multiple adjustments were made to a thirdparty transaction in order to determine a comparable price, the court in<T3>Ciba-Geigy </T3>rejected as comparables licenses of the same productto unrelated parties because of differences in geographic markets, yearsof the license, and differences in required purchases of raw materials.\85\<NOTE/> Instead the court relied upon testimony from an unrelatedparty about what his company would have been willing to pay in the formof a royalty for the same rights. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\84\ 85 T.C. 172 (1985). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\85\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 225-26.  The comparability of third party resale price margins was at issue in <T3>E.I. DuPont de Nemours andamp; Co. v. United States </T3>[<T3>DuPont</T3>].\86\<NOTE/> In that case, the U.S. parent company incorporated DuPontInternational S.A., DISA, in Switzerland to serve as a super distributorof DuPont products in Europe. Internal DuPont memos indicated that DuPontplanned to sell its goods to DISA at prices below fair market value, sothat on resale most of the profits would be reported in a foreign countryhaving much lower tax rates than the United States.\87\<NOTE/> Although for many products DISA performed no special servicesfor either DuPont or its customers, DuPont structured its pricing to DISAanticipating that the latter would capture 75 percent of the total profitsinvolved, although DISA actually realized less than this percentage. TheService reallocated much of this profit back to the parent.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\86\ 608 F.2d 445 (Ct. Cl. 1979). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\87\ The facts in <T3>DuPont </T3>are similar to the abuse relating to the use of foreignbase sales companies to defer the taxation of income in the United Statesthat Congress sought to end through the Subpart F provisions enacted inthe Revenue Act of 1962. H.R. Rep. No. 1447, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 28 (1962).The government introduced expert testimony at trial to the effect that,after the allocations, DISA's ratio of gross income to total operatingcosts was greater than that achieved by 32 specific firms that were functionallysimilar to DISA. Additionally, it was shown that, after the allocations,DISA's return on capital was greater than that of 96 percent of 1133 companiessurveyed.\88\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\88\ <T3>See </T3>discussion <T3>infra </T3>Chapter 5 regarding the income to costs ratio and returnon capital methods used in <T3>DuPont. </T3>The taxpayer, on the other hand, relied solely upon the resale price method.It contended that similar companies selling similar products experiencedaverage markups of between 19.5 and 38 percent, comparing favorably withDISA's 26 percent gross profit margin. In rejecting the taxpayer's positionthe court made the following comments:<ITAG tagnum="21">Taxpayer tells us that a group of 21 distributors, whose general functionswere similar to DISA's, provides the proper base of comparison. Beyondthe most general showing that this group, like DISA, distributed manufacturedgoods, there is nothing in the record showing the degree of similaritycalled for by the regulation. No data exist to establish similarity ofproducts (with associated marketing costs), comparability of functions,or parallel geographic (and economic) market conditions. Rather, the recordsuggests significant differences. Defendant has introduced evidence thatthe six companies plaintiff identifies most closely with DISA all had averageselling costs much higher than DISA. Because we agree with the trial judgeand defendant's expert that, in general, what a business spends to provideservices is a reasonable indication of the magnitude of those services,and because plaintiff has not rebutted that normal presumption in thiscase, we cannot view these six companies as having made resales similarto DISA's. They may have made gross profits comparable to DISA's but theirselling costs, reflecting the greater scale of their services or efforts,were much higher in each instance. Moreover, the record shows that thesecompanies dealt with quite different products (electronic and photographicequipment) and functioned in different markets (primarily the United States).\89\<NOTE/> </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\89\ <T3>Supra </T3>n. 86. Another case that raised questions of comparability is <T3>United States Steel v. </T3><T3>Comm'r.</T3>\90\<NOTE/> There, the Service contended that Navios, the petitioner'swholly owned shipping company, was charging the petitioner more than anarm's length rate for shipping ore from Venezuela to United States ports.The government relied on evidence that, had U.S. Steel contracted withother shippers for the same tonnage per year, it would have paid considerablylower rates. The petitioner countered that, because Navios charged unrelatedsteel producers the same rate as the petitioner, a perfect comparable wasavailable from which to determine an arm's length price. The governmentcontended that the unrelated third party transactions were not comparablebecause they were few in number, they were not based on a continuing long-termrelationship, and the volume shipped was much smaller than the ten milliontons annually shipped by Navios for U.S. Steel. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\90\ 617 F.2d 942 (2d Cir. 1980), <T3>rev'g </T3>T.C. Memo. 1977-140. The Tax Court did not decide the case on the basis of comparables. Instead,the court focused on constructed freight charges and on the profit thatthe tax haven subsidiary was projected by the taxpayer to earn on the activitiesit undertook. On appeal, the Second Circuit held that, if appropriate comparables wereavailable to support the petitioner's prices, no section 482 allocationwould be sustained despite evidence tending to show that the activitiesresulted in a shifting of tax liability among controlled taxpayers.\91\<NOTE/> The appellate court accepted the third party transactionsas comparables and reversed the Tax Court on this issue, notwithstandingthe substantial economic differences from the related party transactions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\91\ 617 F.2d at 951. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Industry Statistics as Comparables </ITAG>The Service and taxpayers have relied on industry statistics in severalcases to justify or defend against section 482 allocations. Industry statisticshave generally been offered as evidence of comparable uncontrolled pricesor for markup percentages under the resale price or cost plus methods.The courts, however, have been reluctant to accept such statistics in theabsence of a specific showing of comparability. In the <T3>DuPont </T3>case, discussed <T3>supra, </T3>the taxpayer relied on gross profit margins of drug andchemical wholesalers contained in the Internal Revenue Service's SourceBook of Statistics of Income for 1960 to support a gross profit marginof 26 percent. The gross profit margins of these companies averaged 21percent and ranged from 9 to 33 percent. The court noted that in applyingthe resale price method it was necessary to find substantially comparableuncontrolled resellers. Because there was no indication from the SourceBook that the necessary degree of comparability was present, the courtrejected the taxpayer's industry statistics. The government relied upon the Source Book of Statistics of Income in <T3>PPG Industries Inc. v. </T3><T3>Comm'r,</T3>\92\<NOTE/> to allocate a substantial portion of the income of a Swisscorporation to its U.S. parent. Rejecting this approach, the court foundthe Source Book evidence wanting because it could not be determined whethercomparable transactions were involved. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\92\ 55 T.C. 928 (1970). In <T3>Ross Glove Co. v. Comm'r,</T3>\93\<NOTE/> the Service allocated income from a foreign glove manufacturerto its U.S. parent. The government relied upon expert testimony that theglove manufacturing industry was not a high profit industry, and that atypical glove manufacturer rarely had a year in which gross profits equalledthree percent of sales. The court rejected this testimony because it didnot relate to the rate of return earned by Philippine glove manufacturers,such as the taxpayer's subsidiary, whose profits generally were higherthan those of U.S. manufacturers. Industry statistics were also rejectedas unreliable in <T3>Edwards v. Comm'r</T3> \94\<NOTE/> and in <T3>Nissho Iwai American Corp. v. Comm'r.</T3>\95\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\93\ 60 T.C. 569 (1973). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\94\ 67 T.C. 224 (1976). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\95\ T.C. Memo. 1985-578. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. The Regulations in the Absence of Comparables </ITAG>The only detailed transfer pricing methods in the regulations rely in oneway or another on comparables. The cases discussed in this chapter, inwhich comparables were generally unavailable, suggest that the regulationsfail to resolve the most significant and potentially abusive fact patterns.This failure was noted both in the Court of Claims opinion and the trialjudge's opinion in <T3>DuPont. </T3>Trial Judge Willi, after finding for the government, suggestedthat the current regulatory structure was wholly inadequate:<ITAG tagnum="21">At least where the sale of tangible property is involved, the Commissioner'sregulations seem to accommodate nothing short of a ``pricing method'' todetermine the question of an arm's length price. Treas. Reg. andSection;1.482-2(3)(e)(1)(iii). Moreover, as plaintiff has correctly noted, theregulation approach seems to rule out net profit as a relevant considerationin the determination of an arm's length price, this despite Congress' encouragementto the contrary, as expressed in H.R. Rep. No. 2508, 87th Cong., 2d Sess.18-19 (1962) (Conference Report). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As evidenced by the magnitude of the record compiled in this case,the resolution by trial of a reallocation controversy under section 482can be a very burdensome, time-consuming and obviously expensive process_especiallyif the stakes are high.

The next chapter describes the methods that the courts haveused to resolve these issues. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Conclusion </ITAG>The failure of the regulations to provide guidance in the absence of comparableproducts and transactions has created problems in cases involving salesof tangible property, the provision of services, and licenses or othertransfers of intangible property. Taxpayers and the courts have been forcedto devise ad hoc ``fourth methods'' to resolve such cases. <ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter 5  </ITAG>Fourth Method Analysis Under Section 482 <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Introduction </ITAG>Although the ``other method'' provision of andSection; 1.482-2(e)(l)(iii)(commonly known as the ``fourth method'') by its terms applies only totangible property transfer pricing cases, the term ``fourth method'' hasbeen used to describe any case resolved by using a method not specificallydescribed in the regulations, typically when comparable uncontrolled transactionswere unavailable. This chapter discusses the use of the ``fourth method''approach in the decided cases, including cases involving the sale of tangibleproperty, the licensing or other transfer of intangible property, and theprovision of services. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Profit Splits </ITAG>The most frequent alternative method used by the courts in the absenceof comparables is the profit split approach. Under this approach, the courtdetermines the total profits allocable to the transactions at issue andsimply divides them between the related parties in some ratio deemed appropriateby the court. The validity of the method, of course, rests on the accuratedetermination of total profits and the reasonableness of the factors usedto set the profit split ratio. An illustration of the profit split method is found in <T3>Lilly.\97\</T3><NOTE/> After rejecting the resale price and cost plus pricing methodsadvocated by the parties because of the absence of comparables, the TaxCourt attempted to find an appropriate fourth method under andSection; 1.482-2(e)(1)(iii)of the regulations. The court cited a number of studies and surveys indicatingthat fourth methods were used by the Service approximately one-third ofthe time, and determined that a profit split approach was permissible.\98\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\97\ <T3>Supra </T3>n. 57.

The results of these surveys andstudies are referenced in Chapter 3, <T3>supra. </T3>In adopting the profit split approach, the Tax Court relied heavily on<T3>PPG Industries Inc.</T3>\99\<NOTE/> The court there, in considering the allocation of incomebetween PPG and its foreign subsidiary, applied a profit split analysis(which produced a 55-45 profit split in favor of PPG) to buttress the court'sprimary analysis using the comparable uncontrolled price method. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\99\ <T3>Supra </T3>n. 92. The Tax Court in <T3>Lilly </T3>also found support in <T3>Lufkin Foundry andamp; Machine Co. v. Comm'r,</T3>\100\<NOTE/> in which it had used a profit split  method. On appeal, theFifth Circuit rejected the Tax Court's profit split approach because thecourt had not attempted to apply the three specific pricing methods inthe regulations and because, by itself, a profit split approach was notsufficient evidence of what parties would have done at arm's length. However,the Court in Lilly distinguished the Fifth Circuit's reversal of the TaxCourt's holding on the following grounds:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\100\ T.C.

After providing for location savings,\102\<NOTE/> manufacturing profit, marketing profit, and a charge forongoing general research and development performed by the parent, the TaxCourt in <T3>Lilly </T3>arrived at undivided profits of $25,489,000 for 1971 and$19,277,000 for 1972.\103\<NOTE/> It considered these amounts to be the profits from intangibles,consisting of manufacturing intangibles belonging to Lilly P.R. and marketingintangibles belonging to Lilly U.S. The court rejected the taxpayer's  argument that its marketing intangibles were of little value and assigned45 percent of the intangible income to Lilly U.S. as a marketing profitand 55 percent of the intangible income to Lilly P.R. as a manufacturingprofit. The court did not explain how it arrived at the 45-55 split, otherthan stating that it used its best judgment and that it bore heavily againstthe taxpayer because it failed to prove the arm's length prices for LillyP.R.'s products.\104\<NOTE/> On appeal, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the Tax Court's profitsplit.\105\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\102\ ``Location savings'' were specifically authorized forcertain Puerto Rican affiliates by Rev.

While the courtcould not technically apply a fourth method under the regulations governingsales of tangible property (since there were no intercompany sales), thecourt nevertheless imposed a profit split similar in result to the profitsplit imposed in <T3>Lilly.  </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\106\ <T3>Supra </T3>n. 59. <T3>See </T3>discussion of <T3>Searle supra </T3>Chapter 4.In <T3>Searle, </T3>the Tax Court did not specifically determine the revenuethat each of the parties should earn from manufacturing and marketing orwhich party should bear the expenses of research and development and administration.While suggesting that additional royalties were due Searle for the intangiblesprovided to SCO, the court stated that ``whether our allocation hereinis considered an additional payment for services or for intangibles thatwere not transferred or as a royalty payment for intangibles themselves,the result is the same.'' \107\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\107\ 88 T.C. at 376. A profit split approach is also contained in section 936(h) of the Code,added by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, effectivefor years beginning after December 31, 1982. In general, section 936(h)authorizes a profit split election under which the combined taxable incomeof the possessions affiliate and the U.S. affiliate, with respect to productsproduced in whole or in part in the possession, will be allocated 50 percentto the possessions affiliate and 50 percent to the U.S. affiliate. If aprofit split election is made, section 482 is not available for any furtherallocation. The section 936(h) 50-50 profit split does not, however, provide any logicalsupport for 50-50 profit splits in cases not falling within the narrowscope of the section. Thus, even though the Tax Court and Congress havemoved in the direction of 50-50 profit splits in some limited cases, itwould appear that  profit splits should only be used in the absence ofappropriate comparables, and then only after a careful analysis of whatfunctions each party has performed, what property they have employed, andwhat risks they have undertaken. When one affiliate's role in the transactionshas been extremely limited, a 50-50 profit split may not be at all appropriate.Such a lopsided division of relevant factors occurred in <T3>Hospital Corporation of America.</T3>\108\<NOTE/> The court's opinion recites in great detail the numerousservices HCA provided for LTD in negotiating the management contract andin staffing and operating the hospital, as well as the numerous intangiblesthat HCA provided, such as its substantial experience, know-how, and managementsystems. Under these circumstances it would be extremely difficult to estimateaccurately the arm's length value for the large volume of services andintangibles made available. It was certainly easier for the court to lookat the relative value of the functions that each party performed, so thata profit split ratio could be developed. The court in <T3>HCA </T3>did just that, adopting a 75-25 (75 for HCA and 25 for LTD)split of the profits previously reported by LTD.\109\<NOTE/> Unfortunately, there is no discernible rationale containedin the opinion for such a split. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\108\ <T3>Supra </T3>n. 17. <T3>See </T3>discussion <T3>supra </T3>Chapter 4. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\109\ 81 T.C. at 601. <T3>Hospital Corporation of America, </T3>like <T3>Searle, </T3>was not a transfer pricing case and therefore was nota fourth method case under the tangibles pricing regulation. However, bothof these cases illustrate that, when highly profitable, unique intangiblesare at issue, traditional methods of valuation will often fail becausecomparables are unavailable. In these circumstances a profit split approachappears reasonable as long as it is based on a careful functional analysisto determine each party's economic contribution to the combined profit.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Rate of Return; Income to Expense Ratios </ITAG>Although profit splits are being used more frequently, the courts haveused other methods as well to justify transfer pricing adjustments. Twoof these methods are illustrated by the <T3>DuPont </T3>\110\<NOTE/> case. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\110\ <T3>Supra </T3>n. 86. <T3>See </T3>discussion <T3>supra </T3>Chapter 4. In defending the Service's section 482 allocations, the government usedtwo different methods. The first method was computing the ratio of grossincome to total operating costs (known as the ``Berry ratio'' because itwas first used by the Government's expert witness, Dr. Charles Berry).DISA's Berry ratio before the allocation was 281.5 percent of operatingexpenses for 1959 and 397.1 percent for 1960. After the section 482 allocation,DISA's Berry ratio was 108.6 for 1959 and 179.3  for 1960. A survey ofsix management firms, five advertising firms, and 21 distributors (firmswhich were generally functionally similar to DISA) revealed average Berryratios ranging from 108.3 to 129.3. Thus, DISA's combined Berry ratio for1959 and 1960 before the allocation was about three times higher than theaverage for the other firms. As noted by the court, in over a hundred yearsof those companies' experience, none of them had ever achieved the ratiosclaimed by DISA. Even after the allocation, its Berry ratio was somewhathigher than that of the comparable firms.\111\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\111\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 456.  The second approach, developed by Dr. Irving Plotkin, was to compare DISA'srate of return on capital to that of 1133 companies that did not necessarilyhave functional similarities to DISA, but instead reflected a comprehensiveselection from industry as a whole. Prior to the allocation, DISA had arate of return of 450 percent in 1959 and 147.2 percent in 1960_rates higherthan those of all 1133 other companies. Even after the allocation, DISA'srate of return exceeded that of 96 percent of the 1133 companies surveyed.\112\<NOTE/> Based on this evidence the court sustained the Service'sallocations. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\112\ <T3>Id. </T3>While the Berry ratio and the rate of return analysis found in <T3>DuPont </T3>are interesting, it should be kept in mind that the  courtmay have looked favorably on this evidence partly because it indicatedthat even after the allocation DISA earned greater profits than almostany other corporation, whether comparable or not.

Over the years the courts, and in particular the Tax Court, have usedvarious fourth methods for determining appropriate arm's length pricesfor section 482 allocations. A profit split is appropriate in some casesto establish a transfer price on an arm's length basis because unrelatedparties are concerned about the respective shares of potential profitswhen entering into a business arrangement.\124\<NOTE/> The problem with the profit split approach taken by the courts,however, is not that the courts have focused on the wrong elements of thetransaction, but that they generally have failed to adopt a consistentand predictable methodology. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\124\ <T3>See </T3>J. Baranson, <T3>Technology and the Multinationals </T3>at 64 (1978). 2. The rate of return on assets and costs to income ratio methods usedin <T3>DuPont </T3>provide some reasonable basis for allocating income anddetermining transfer prices in the absence of comparables. However, thesemethods have not yet been sufficiently developed by the courts to fillthe gap in analysis left by the section 482 regulations when comparableuncontrolled transactions cannot be located. A profit split or other methodshould be developed to determine transfer prices in the absence of comparables,which is the subject of Part III of this study. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. SECTION 482 AFTER THE 1986 TAX REFORM ACT </ITAG>Part I of the study described the history of section 482, its administrationby the Service, and its interpretation by the courts. The lack of specificguidance in the tangible property, intangible property, and services provisionsof the section 482 regulations to resolve cases for which appropriate comparablesdo not exist_notably cases involving high profit intangibles_has causedsignificant problems for taxpayers, the Service, and courts alike. The amendment made by the 1986 Act to section 482 is Congress' responseto the problem described in Part I of determining transfer pricing forhigh profit intangibles. Specifically, section 482 was amended to providethat income from a transfer or license of intangible property shall becommensurate with the income attributable to the intangible. This PartII discusses the scope of the commensurate with income standard and therequirement for periodic adjustments. The compatibility of these changeswith the international norm for transfer pricing_the arm's length principle_isalso discussed. Finally, this part explores the role of safe harbors foravoiding adjustments under section 482.<ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter 6 </ITAG>The Commensurate With Income Standard <ITAG tagnum="81">A.

Memo. 1963-14, where the TaxCourt sanctioned a taxpayer's post-agreement increase in royalties paidby an affiliate for a very profitable intangible license. The opinion statesthat ``[s]o long as the amount of the royalty paid was <T3>commensurate with the value of the benefits received and was reasonable,</T3>we would not be inclined to, nor do we think we would be justifiedto, conclude that the increased royalty was something other than what itpurported to be.'' (Emphasis supplied). There is, however, nothing in thelegislative record to indicate that this is the case or to indicate Congressionalapproval or disapproval of the result in <T3>Nestle.</T3>The primary difficulty addressed by the legislation was the selective transferof high profit intangibles to tax havens. Because these intangibles areso often unique and are typically not licensed to unrelated parties, itis difficult, if not impossible, to find comparables from which an arm'slength transfer price can be derived. When justifying the compensation paid for such intangibles, however, taxpayers often used comparisons withindustry averages, looked solely at the purportedly limited facts knownat the time of the transfer, or did not consider the potential profitabilityof the transferred intangible (as demonstrated by post-agreement results).Taxpayers relied on intangibles used in vastly different product and geographicmarkets, compared short-term and long-term contracts, and drew analogiesto transfers where the parties performed entirely different functions inderiving income from the intangible. Congress determined that the existing regime, which depends heavily uponthe use of comparables and provides little clear guidance in the absenceof comparables, was not in all cases achieving the statutory goal of reflectingthe true taxable income of related parties. Congress therefore decidedthat a refocused approach was necessary in the absence of true comparables.The amount of income derived from a transferred intangible should be thestarting point of a section 482 analysis and should be given primary weight.\127\<NOTE/> Further, it is important to analyze the functions performed,and the economic costs and risks assumed by each party to the transaction,so that the allocation of income from the use of the intangible will bemade in accordance with the relative economic contributions and risk takingof the parties.\128\<NOTE/> The application of the functional analysis approach to theactual profit experience from the exploitation of the intangible allocatesto the parties profits that are commensurate with intangible income. Lookingat the income related to the intangible and splitting it according to relativeeconomic contributions is consistent with what unrelated parties do. Thegeneral goal of the commensurate with income standard is, therefore, toensure that each party earns the income or return from the intangible thatan unrelated party would earn in an arm's length transfer of the intangible.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\127\ 1985 House Rep., <T3>supra </T3>n. 47, at 426. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\128\ 1986 Conf. Rep., <T3>supra </T3>n. 2, at II-637. In determining the income that forms the basis for application of the commensuratewith income standard, what time frame should be used as a point of reference:The time of the transfer alone, or an annual or other periodic basis? Thelegislative history reflects Congressional concern that, by confining ananalysis of an appropriate transfer price to the time a transfer was made,taxpayers could transfer a high profit potential intangible at an earlystage and attempt to justify use of an inappropriate royalty rate by claimingthat they did not know that the product would become successful.\129\<NOTE/> Accordingly, for these reasons, Congress determined thatthe actual profit experience should be used in determining the appropriatecompensation for the intangible and that periodic adjustments  should bemade to the compensation to reflect substantial changes in intangible incomeas well as changes in the economic activities performed and economic costsand risks borne by the related parties in exploiting the intangibles.\130\<NOTE/> As discussed further below, this is consistent with whatunrelated parties would do. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\129\ 1985 House Rep., <T3>supra </T3>n. 47, at 424. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\130\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 425-426. The legislative history indicates that the commensurate with income standarddoes not prescribe a specific, formulary approach for determining an intangibletransfer price. For example, it does not automatically require that thetransferor of the intangible receive all income attributable to the exploitationof the intangible. It does not prescribe (nor depend for its applicationupon) a specific legal form for transfers of intangible property. Thus,it applies to licenses of intangible property, sales of tangible propertywhich incorporate valuable intangibles, and to transfers of intangiblesthrough the provision of services. Nor does it mandate any specific treatmentof the transferor or transferee. In particular, the provision does notmandate a ``contract manufacturer'' return for the licensee in all cases.\131\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\131\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 426.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Scope of Application </ITAG>The scope of the commensurate with income standard is not discussed inthe legislative history. Two proposals have been made for limiting thescope of the standard, one based on potential double taxation and one limitingthe application of the provision to the types of cases that prompted thelegislative change. 1. <T3>Double taxation and related issues. </T3>Double taxation can occurwhen two countries have different rules of allocation; have the same rulesbut interpret or apply them differently in actual operation; have the samerules and interpret and apply them in the same way, but do not allow correlativeadjustments; or permit correlative adjustments in theory but do not removeprocedural barriers (<T3>e.q., </T3>statutes of limitation on refund claims).\132\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\132\ International Fiscal Association, <T3>Cahiers de Droit Fiscal International </T3>(Studies on InternationalFiscal Law), Vol. LVI, at I-6 (1971). Taxpayers and others have argued that the commensurate with income standardwill necessarily increase the incidence of double taxation, and that thereforeCongressional intent should not be fully implemented. As described morefully in the next chapter, the correct application of the commensuratewith income standard is premised soundly on arm's length principles. TheService and Treasury therefore do not believe that the commensurate withincome principle will increase the incidence of double taxation. Indeed, in fairly common cases where the commensurate with income standardwill be applied_outbound transfers of intangibles from U.S. parents toforeign subsidiaries_the issue of double taxation does not arise. In thesesituations, the foreign tax credit provisions of U.S. domestic law (includingthe foreign sourcing and characterization of royalties relating to intangiblesused overseas) will normally prevent the double taxation of earnings.\133\<NOTE/> Furthermore, the outbound transfer patterns that were thesubject of Congressional concern involve transfers to manufacturing affiliateslocated in tax havens, where there is no potential for double taxation.The question of whether the appropriate amount of income is attributedto foreign operations in these cases is, therefore, whether the correctamount of income is eligible for deferral from U.S. tax and whether itis properly characterized for foreign withholding tax purposes, ratherthan the issue of double taxation. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\133\ So long as the foreign affiliate ultimately pays outits residual earnings as a dividend and exhausts its remedies for obtainingan adjustment in the foreign jurisdiction, the total amount of foreignsource income on the U.S. return in the relevant limitation category (and,therefore, the amount of limitation under section 904) will be the sameno matter what the amount of royalty, and the taxes paid by the foreignaffiliate will be deemed paid by the U.S. parent. The operation of theforeign tax credit will thus prevent any double taxation on those earningsirrespective of the amount of the royalty payment for U.S. tax purposes.2. <T3>Legislative impetus. </T3>The commensurate with income standard wasclearly intended to overcome problems encountered in applying the section482 regulations to transfers of high profit potential intangibles, suchas those at issue in <T3>Lilly </T3>and <T3>Searle. </T3>Because of its origin as a response to the problem ofhigh profit intangibles, it has been suggested that the commensurate withincome standard should be limited to transfers of high profit intangiblesto affiliates in low tax jurisdictions.\134\<NOTE/> The statute, however, applies to all related party transfersof intangibles, both inbound and outbound,\135\<NOTE/> without quantitative or qualitative restrictions. Furthermore,the economic theory of arm's length dealing underlying the methods setforth in this study apply to all transfers of intangibles, regardless ofthe type of intangible or residence of the licensee. Consequently, thecommensurate with income standard should apply to transfers of all relatedparty intangibles, not just the high profit potential intangibles. Theanalysis set forth in Chapter 11 provides a framework for implementingthe commensurate with income standard that can be applied to all intangibletransfers, rather than merely to high profit potential intangibles. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\134\ Wright andamp; Clowery, <T3>The Super-Royalty: A Suggested Regulatory Approach, </T3>Tax Notes,July 27, 1987, at 429-436. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\135\ 1986 Conf. Rep., <T3>supra </T3>n. 2, at II-637. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Application of Commensurate With Income Standard to Normal Profitand High Profit Intangibles </ITAG>1. <T3>Normal profit intangibles. </T3>In related party transfers of normalprofit intangibles, there are likely to be comparable third party licenses.Such licenses can produce evidence of arm's length dealings. The arm'slength bargaining of the unrelated parties over the terms of the arrangementreflects each party's judgment about what its share of the combined income(or appropriate expense reimbursement) ought to be. Hence, each has madea judgment that the remuneration it expects to receive is commensuratewith the income attributable to its exploitation of the intangible. Application of the commensurate with income standard to normal profit intangibleswill ordinarily produce results consistent with those obtained under pre-1986law in those cases where economically appropriate comparables were used.For example, the licensing agreement for the formula to a particular brandof perfume is likely to have many ``inexact'' comparables.\136\<NOTE/> If appropriate comparables exist, they can be examined todetermine an arm's length, or commensurate with income, return. Thus, inmany cases the appropriate income allocation under both the existing regulationsand the commensurate with income standard will be the same, provided thatinternal and external standards of comparability are met.\137\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\136\ <T3>See </T3>discussion of the concepts of inexact and exact comparables<T3>infra </T3>Chapter 11. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\137\ <T3>See </T3>discussion of the concepts of internal and external comparability<T3>infra </T3>Chapter 11. 2. <T3>High profit potential intangibles. </T3>As described in Chapter 4,the difficulty in applying section 482 to high profit potential intangibles\138\<NOTE/> is that unrelated party licenses of comparable intangiblesalmost never exist. Consequently, if the appropriate related party transferprice for a high profit potential intangible is expressed in terms of aroyalty, the result may not bear any resemblance to a third party licensefor a normal intangible. That is, owing to the intangible's enormous profitability,an allocation under the commensurate with income standard, if made solelythrough a royalty rate adjustment, might be so large compared to normalproduct royalty rates that it does not look like an arm's length royalty.Therefore, one might argue that an extraordinarily high rate could neverbe an arm's length royalty merely because third party royalties are neverthat high. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\138\ The term high profit potential intangibles refers tothose products which generate profits far beyond the normal returns foundin the industry. No specific definition or formula for determining whetheran item is a high profit potential product is suggested herein. Nonetheless,hypothetical products such as an AIDS vaccine, a cure for the common cold,or a cheap substitute for gasoline would all fit into this concept becauseof the enormous consumer demand for such a product, the market protectionprovided by a patent, and the corresponding potential for enormous profitability.Similarly, a patented product that just happens to work better than others,or produces the same result with fewer side effects, may also qualify.From an economic perspective, however, an unprecedented or ``super-royalty''rate may be required to appropriately reflect a relatively minor economiccontribution by the transferee and achieve a proper allocation of income.\139\<NOTE/> As discussed in Chapter 11, the commensurate with incomestandard, in requiring a ``super-royalty'' rate in order to achieve a properallocation of income in such a case, does not mandate a rate in excessof arm's length rates. Nor does it permit taxpayers to set a ``super-royalty''rate in excess of arm's length rates. For example, enactment of the commensuratewith income standard would not justify royalty increases in excess of arm'slength rates by U.S. affiliates of foreign parent corporations (or viceversa). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\139\ The German tax authorities have faced a similar situation,and the imputation of very high royalty rates has led to the charge thatthe imputed royalties are not arm's length. <T3>See </T3>Jacob, <T3>The New ``Super-Royalty'' Provisions of Internal Revenue Code 1986:A German Perspective, </T3>27 European Taxation 320 (1987). Rather than creating a new class of royalty arrangements, the enactmentof the commensurate with income standard reflects the recognition that,for certain classes of intangibles (notably high profit potential intangiblesfor which comparables do not exist), the use of inappropriate comparableshad failed to produce results consistent with the arm's length standard.Enactment of the commensurate with income standard was thus a directiveto promulgate rules that would give primary weight to the income attributableto a transferred intangible in  determining the proper division of thatincome among related parties. In the rare instance in which there is atrue comparable for a high profit intangible, the royalty rate must beset on the basis of the comparable because that remains the best measureof how third parties would allocate intangible income. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Special Arrangements </ITAG>1. <T3>Lump sum sales or royalties. </T3>Some commentators have suggestedthat the commensurate with income standard should not prohibit the useof non-contingent, lump sum royalty or sale payments. While the Serviceand Treasury agree that parties are free to structure their transactionsas either a sale or license, the economic consequences of a lump sum paymentarrangement generally must resemble those under a periodic payment approachin order to satisfy the commensurate with income standard, unless the taxpayercan demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that such treatmentis inappropriate on the basis of arm's length arrangements, <T3>i.e., </T3>an exact or inexact comparable transaction.\140\<NOTE/> By its terms, the amendment to section 482 applies to <T3>any </T3>transfer of an intangible, which includes an outright transferby sale or license for a non-contingent, lump sum amount.\141\<NOTE/> Furthermore, exempting such arrangements from the commensuratewith income standard would elevate form over  substance and encourage non-arm'slength lump sum arrangements designed to circumvent the new rules. Thus,periodic adjustments may be required under the commensurate with incomestandard even in the case of lump sum sale or royalty arrangements.\142\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\140\ <T3>See infra </T3>Chapter 11. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\141\ 1985 House Rep., <T3>supra </T3>n. 47, at 425. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\142\ <T3>See </T3>discussion of the mechanism for making adjustments to lumpsum payments <T3>infra </T3>Chapter 8.  2. <T3>Interaction with section 367(d). </T3>Section 367(d), enacted as partof the 1984 Tax Reform Act, provides that when intangible property is transferredby a U.S. person to a foreign corporation in a transaction described insections 351 or 361, the transferor shall be treated as receiving annualpayments, over the useful life of the property, contingent on productivityor use of the property. regardless of whether such payments are actuallymade. These payments are treated as U.S. source income. A subsequent dispositionto an unrelated party of either the intangible property or the stock inthe transferee triggers immediate gain recognition. The 1986 Act made thecommensurate with income standard applicable in computing payments attributableto the transferor under section 367(d). The periodic adjustment of lumpsum royalty or sale payments would merely achieve parity with section 367(d)transfers.\143\<NOTE/> Section 367(d) may also suggest that certain exceptions fromthe periodic payment approach may be appropriate_<T3>e.g., </T3>transfers  to corporations in which an unrelated corporationhas a substantial enough interest that an objective valuation of the transferredintangible can be considered to be arm's length.\144\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\143\ Staff of Joint Comm. on Taxation, <T3>General Explanation of the Revenue Provisions of the Deficit ReductionAct of 1984, </T3>98th Cong., 2d Sess. 432-433 (1984) [hereinafter <T3>General Explanation of the DRA of 1984</T3>]. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\144\ The Service and Treasury invite comments as to whetherthis possible exception should be under a different standard than the conceptof control under section 482.  Sales and licenses of intangibles are generally not subject to section367(d), since they are not transactions described in sections 351 or 361.The temporary regulations state that, when an actual license or sale hasoccurred, an adjustment to the consideration received by the transferorshall be made solely under section 482, without reference to section 367(d).\145\<NOTE/> However, if the purported sale or license to the relatedperson is for no consideration \146\<NOTE/> or if the terms of the purported sale or license differ sogreatly from the substance of an arm's length transfer that the transfershould be considered a sham,\147\<NOTE/> the transfer will be treated as falling within section 367(d).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\145\ Treas.

In essence, the commensurate with income standard treats related partytransfers of intangibles as if an intangible had been transferred for alicense payment that reflects the intangible's value throughout its usefullife, a result similar to section 367(d). Because the section 367(d) sourceof income  rule can apply to certain transactions cast in the form of asale or license, the temporary regulations could be amended to specifywhich sales or licenses are subject to both the commensurate with incomestandard and the U.S. source income characterization of section 367(d).Moreover, a license payment that is less than some specific percentageof the appropriate arm's length amount could be considered so devoid ofeconomic substance that the arm's length charge should be subject to section367(d).

Congress enacted the commensurate with income standard because applicationof existing rules had not focused appropriate attention upon the incomegenerated by the transfer of an intangible in situations in which comparablesdo not exist. 2. Application of the commensurate with income standard requires the determinationof the income from a transferred intangible, and a functional analysisof the economic activities performed and the economic costs and risks borneby the related parties in exploiting the intangible, so that the intangibleincome can be allocated on the basis of the relative economic contributionsof the related parties. The commensurate with income standard does notmandate a ``contract manufacturer'' return for the licensee in all or evenmost cases. 3. The commensurate with income standard requires that intangible incomebe redetermined and reallocated periodically to reflect substantial changesin intangible income, or changes in the economic activities performed andeconomic costs and risks borne by the related parties. 4. The application of the functional analysis approach to the actual profitexperience from the exploitation of intangibles is consistent with whatunrelated parties would do and is, therefore, consistent with the arm'slength principle. 5. Because the commensurate with income standard is consistent with arm'slength principles, it should not increase the incidence of double taxation.6. The commensurate with income standard applies to all types of intangibleproperty transfers between related parties, not just high profit potentialintangibles, including both inbound and outbound transfers of intangibles.In the cases of normal profit intangibles in which comparables normallyexist, the new standard, like prior law, will ordinarily base the analysison comparable transactions, with refinements in the definition of appropriatecomparables. In any event, intangible income must be allocated on the basisof comparable transactions if comparables exist. 7. Lump sum sale and royalty payments for intangibles generally will besubject to the commensurate with income standard. <ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter 7 </ITAG>Compatibility With International Transfer Pricing Standards <ITAG tagnum="81">A.

As a result, they argued, the application of the commensuratewith income standard would lead to double taxation for which no remedywould exist under treaties, because of application of transfer pricingstandards by the United States that would be inconsistent with those appliedby various other foreign governments.\150\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\150\ <T3>See </T3>discussion <T3>supra </T3>Chapter 6 regarding relief from double taxation pursuantto the foreign tax credit provisions and sourcing rules of United Statesinternal law.

Appendix C to this study summarizes the legal andadministrative approaches similar to those described throughout this studytaken by some of our major treaty partners in dealing with transfer pricingissues. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. The Arm's Length Standard as an International Norm </ITAG>The problem of double taxation arising from different transfer pricingmethods has been addressed through intergovernnental negotiation and agreement,principally in bilateral tax treaties that specifically provide for certainadjustments by the treaty partners to the tax liability of any entity whenits dealings with related entities differ from those that would have occurredbetween unrelated parties. For example, an OECD model income tax conventionpermits adjustments to the profits of an enterprise where, in dealing withrelated enterprises, ``conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprisesin their commercial or financial relations which differ from those whichwould be made between independent enterprises * * *.'' \152\<NOTE/> If the adjustment is consistent with that  standard, theOECD Model Convention calls for the other contracting state to make anadjustment to the profits of the enterprise in its jurisdiction to takeinto account the first state's adjustments.\153\<NOTE/> If differences of opinion arise between the two states asto the proper application of this standard, the OECD Model Convention callsfor the competent authorities of the respective jurisdictions to consultwith one another.\154\<NOTE/> The other major model used by countries in negotiating theirtax treaties, the United Nations Model Double Taxation Convention BetweenDeveloped and Developing Countries, contains an Article 9 entitled ``AssociatedEnterprises'' that is not materially different.\155\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\152\ Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development,Committee on Fiscal Affairs, <T3>Model Double Taxation Convention on Income and on Capital, </T3>Art.9(1) (``Associated Enterprises'') (1977) [hereinafter OECD Model Convention].<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\153\ <T3>Id.</T3> at Art. 9(2).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\154\ <T3>Id. </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\155\ <T3>United Nations Model Double Taxation Convention Between Developed andDeveloping Countries, </T3>U.N.

The purpose of this paragraphis only to make explicit that the use of the word ``profits'' in the OECDmodel does not constrain either jurisdiction to make adjustments, consistentwith the arm's length standard of paragraph 1, with respect to deductions,credits, or other allowances between related persons. This provision readsas follows: <ITAG tagnum="28">3.

It is equally clear as a policy matter that, in the interest of avoidingextreme positions by other jurisdictions and minimizing the incidence ofdisputes over primary taxing jurisdiction in international transactions,the United States should continue to adhere to the arm's length standard.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Reference to Profitability Under the Arm's Length Standard </ITAG>Because the arm's length standard is the international norm, a seriouspotential for disputes over primary taxing jurisdiction would exist ifthe United States were to implement the commensurate with income standardin a manner that violates arm's length principles. Does a system which,only in the absence of appropriate comparable transactions, places primaryemphasis upon the income (or profits) related parties earn from exploitingan intangible violate the arm's length standard, as understood in the internationalcontext? Probably the most commonly referenced expression of the arm's length standardas understood by the nations that have adopted it is a report issued in1979 by the OECD.\161\<NOTE/> This report adopts the general principle of arm's lengthpricing for all transactions between related parties. Concerning transfersof intangible property, the report states: <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\161\ OECD, <T3>Transfer Pricing and Multinational Enterprises, supra </T3>n. 158.<ITAG tagnum="20">The general principle to be taken as the basis for the evaluationfor tax purposes of transfer prices between associated enterprises undercontracts for licensing patents or know-how is that the prices should bethose which would be paid between independent enterprises acting at arm'slength.\162\</ITAG><NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\162\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 51. It is useful to refer to those methods that the report considers inconsistentwith its arm's length concept to aid in defining such concept. These thereport refers to as ``global'' methods for transfer pricing. They wouldinclude, for example, ``allocating profits in some cases in proportionto the respective costs of the associated enterprises, sometimes in proportionto their respective turnovers or to their respective labour forces, orby some formula taking account of several such criteria.'' \163\<NOTE/> The report criticizes these methods as necessarily arbitrary.\164\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\163\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 14. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\164\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 14-15. The report also notes that the effect of its arm's length approach, asdistinguished from those it criticizes, is:<ITAG tagnum="20">[T]o recognise the actual transactions as the starting point for thetax assessment and not, in other than exceptional cases, to disregard themor substitute other transactions for them.

Nowhere, however, does the report suggest that the profits of the relatedenterprises are irrelevant to this determination. Indeed, there are severalinstances where the report specifically authorizes an inquiry into profitsor profitability. For example, the report notes:<ITAG tagnum="20">[Its criticism of global methods] is not to say, however, that inseeking to arrive at the arm's length price in a range of transactions,some regard to the total profits of the relevant [multinational enterprise]may not be helpful, as a check on the assessment of the arm's length priceor in specific bilateral situations where other methods give rise to seriousdifficulties and the two countries concerned are able to adopt a commonapproach and the necessary information can be made available.\166\</ITAG><NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\166\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 15.In arriving at an arm's length price, the report specifically authorizesan analysis of economic functions performed by each related party in determining``when a profit is likely to arise and roughly what sort of profit it islikely to be.'' \167\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\167\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 17. Other references to profits occur in the report. For example, in the sectionof the report relating to the sale of tangible goods entitled ``Methodsof Ascertaining an Arm's Length Price,'' methods are outlined that permitreference to comparable profits or returns on capital invested as a meansof determining the appropriate transfer price. These methods are viewedby the report as a supplement to the traditional approach of looking tocomparable transactions, but they are clearly suggested as appropriatetools for arriving at a proper transfer price.\168\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\168\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 42-43. With regard to valuing transfers of intangible property, the report notesthat, ``[o]ne of the common approaches employed in practice is to makea pragmatic appraisal of the trend of an enterprise's profits over a longperiod in comparison with those of other unrelated parties engaged in thesame or similar activities and operating in the same area.'' \169\<NOTE/> The report questions whether this approach is practical,because it would be difficult to isolate respective profits due to different accounting methods, and difficult to know-how to apportion the overallprofit between the two parties. No suggestion is made, however, that sucha method could never be used in the absence of comparable transactionsbecause it conflicts in principle with the arm's length standard.\170\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\169\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 54.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\170\ The objection raised in the report regarding the typeof analysis advocated in this report is not that it violates the arm'slength standard, but that it may call for more information than can bepractically obtained and analyzed by the tax authorities. See <T3>id. </T3>at 15. As noted in Appendix D, the degree of detail and analysisthat will be called for under the new methodology will depend in each caseon the magnitude of the potential for income shifting. Further, in casesof transfers of routine intangibles, available comparable licenses willgenerally obviate the need for almost all of this information. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Periodic Adjustments Under the Arm's Length Standard </ITAG>The next chapter describes an important element of the commensurate withincome standard_periodic adjustments must be made in appropriate casesto reflect actual profit experience under the license. As noted in thatchapter, there are sound arm's length reasons to require such adjustments_principallythe rarity of long-term, fixed licenses negotiated at arm's length, particularlywith respect to high profit potential intangibles, and the fact that actualprofit experience under a license indicates in most cases anticipated profitsthat would have been considered by unrelated parties. Moreover, that chapterpermits taxpayers to avoid adjustments over time if they can demonstrateon the basis of arm's length evidence that no  such adjustments would havebeen made by unrelated parties. The Service and Treasury therefore believethat such periodic adjustments as will be made under the new standard willbe consistent with the arm's length standard as embodied in U.S. doubletaxation treaties. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Resolution of Bilateral Issues </ITAG>The Service and Treasury recognize that implementation of the commensuratewith income standard in all its particulars, including periodic adjustments,treatment of lump-sum payments \171\<NOTE/> and access to information to perform the necessary analysis,may lead to differences with the competent authorities of our treaty partnersand perhaps more general issues of treaty policy and interpretation. Recognizingthis, the United States competent authority and the Treasury Departmentshould be receptive to the concerns of foreign governments, and endeavorto seek bilateral solutions insofar as those concerns can be accommodatedin a manner consistent with Congressional intent in enacting the commensuratewith income standard. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\171\ See the discussion <T3>infra </T3>Chapter 8. <ITAG tagnum="81">F. Conclusions </ITAG>1. The arm's length standard requires that each entity calculate its profitsseparately and that related party  transactions be priced as if unrelatedparties had entered into them. Reference to the profits (including thetrend of those profits over time) of related parties to determine a royaltyin a licensing transaction is intended to reflect what unrelated partieswould do and, therefore, is consistent with the arm's length standard.2. The arm's length standard as accepted by the international communitydoes not preclude reference to profits of related parties to allocate income,but in fact encompasses such an approach as a supplement to the traditionalapproach of looking to comparable transactions. It is, therefore, reasonableto conclude that such an approach is consistent with international normsas applied to situations in which comparables do not exist. 3. The approach taken by Congress in enacting the commensurate with incomestandard and the approaches suggested in Chapters 8 and 11, <T3>infra, </T3>for implementing that standard, including the provisionfor periodic adjustments, are consistent with internationally recognizedarm's length principles. Applied in a manner consistent with arm's lengthprinciples, the commensurate with income standard is not likely to increaseinternational disputes over the right of primary taxing jurisdiction. 4. The United States competent authority and the Treasury Department shouldendeavor whenever possible to seek bilateral solutions to problems thatmay arise with our treaty partners in the interpretation and administrationof the commensurate with income standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter 8</ITAG>Periodic Adjustments<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Introduction</ITAG>As discussed in Chapter 6, an intangible transfer price that is commensuratewith the income attributable to the intangible must reflect the ``actualprofit experience realized as a consequence of the transfer.'' \1\\7\\2\<NOTE/> The ``commensurate with income'' language requires that changesbe made to the transfer payments to reflect substantial changes in theincome stream attributable to the intangible as well as substantial changesin the economic activities performed, assets employed, and economic costsand risks borne by related entities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\2\ 1985 House Rep., <T3>supra</T3> n. 47, at 425.The Congressional directive to the Service to make adjustments to intangiblereturns that reflect the actual profit experience is in part a legislativerejection of <T3>R.T French v. Comm'r.</T3>\1\\7\\3\<NOTE/> That case endorsed the view that a long-term, fixed rateroyalty agreement could not be adjusted under section 482 based on subsequentevents that were not known to the parties at the original contract date.Thus, underlying the directive is perhaps a view that contractual arrangementsbetween unrelated parties_particularly those involving high profit intangibles_arenot entered into on a long term basis without some mechanism for adjustingthe arrangement if the profitability of the intangible is significantlyhigher or lower than anticipated. A very preliminary review of unrelatedparty licensing agreements obatined from the files of the Securities andExchange Commission, discussed in Appendix D, and other input receivedto date, seems to support this view. Indeed, as a matter of long term businessstrategy, unrelated parties may renegotiate contractual arrangements evenabsent explicit renegotiation provisions to reflect revised expectationsregarding an intangible's profitability.\1\\7\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\173\ 60 T.C. 836 (1973).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\4\ Since related parties always have the ability torenegotiate contractual arrangements, explicit contractual provisions permittingrenegotiation of related party arrangements would have little meaning and,therefore, should not be a prerequisite for making adjustments. Furthermore,related party contracts that contain these provisions will not necessarilylead to results that conform to the experience of unrelated parties operatingunder similar circumstances. If the contract proves more profitable thanexpected, the parties can refuse to renegotiate or adjust it, despite explicitprovisions in the contract which permit or require them to do so. Thus,requiring that related party contracts mimic the terms of unrelated partycontracts will not alone ensure that the results experienced by the relatedparties under those contracts will approximate arm's length dealing. 1985House Rep., <T3>supra</T3> n. 47 at 425-426. Without the ability to make changes foradjustments over time, related party agreements will be observed when theysuit the tax needs of the parties and amended or changed when they workto their detriment. <T3>Compare R.T. French Co. v. Comm'r,</T3> 60 T.C. 836 (1973), <T3>with Nestle Co., Inc. v. Comm'r</T3>, T.C. Memo. 1963-14.Aside from the empirical evidence of what unrelated parties seem to do,actual profit experience is generally the best indication available absentcomparables, of anticipated profit experience that arm's length partieswould have taken into account at the outset of the arrangement. It is,therefore, perfectly consistent with the arm's length standard to treatrelated party license agreements generally as renegotiable arrangementsand to require periodic adjustments to the transfer price to reflect substantialchanges in the income stream attributable to the intangible.\1\\7\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\5\ Periodic adjustments will also obviate the needfor the often fruitless inquiry into the state of mind of the taxpayerand its affiliate at the outset.Intangible transfer prices will in any event be determined on the basisof comparables if they exist. If a particular taxpayer demonstrates thatit has comparable long-term, non-renegotiable contractual arrangementswith third parties, the arm's length standard will preclude periodic adjustmentsof the related person intangible transfer price. In that event, a comparablewould exist by definition, which would determine the consideration forthe related person transfer, both initially and over time. Comparablesare always the best measure of arm's length prices. In the case of a highprofit intangible, however, a third party transaction generally must bean exact comparable in order for the transaction to constitute a validcomparable.\1\\7\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\6\ <T3>See </T3>the discussion <T3>infra</T3> Chapter 11, regarding the role of comparables in determiningwhether an adjustment over time is necessary.It may also be possible in certain other cases to exclude subsequent profitexperience from consideration under the arm's length standard. To do so,the taxpayer would need to demonstrate each of the following to avoid anadjustment based on subsequent profit experience:1. That events had occurred subsequent to the license agreement that causedthe unanticipated profitability;2. That the license contained no provision pursuant to which unrelatedparties would have adjusted the license; and 3. That unrelated parties would not have included a provision to permitadjustment for the change that caused the unanticipated profitability.For example, assume that there are twelve heart drugs that perform similartherapeutic functions, none of which has a dominant market share. Severalof these drugs are licensed to unrelated parties under long term arrangementswhich do not provide a mechanism for adjusting the royalty payments becauseof subsequent changes. The taxpayer's drug, which is licensed to a relatedparty, uses an active ingredient which is different from the other productswith which it competes. The competitor's drugs, however, lose all of theirmarket share during the course of the license agreement because their productsare found to cause serious side effects, and the licensed product's profitsincrease dramatically. In this case, if the taxpayer could prove the threefactors above, the taxpayer could avoid an adjustment based on the increasein profitability.As noted earlier, Congress was particularly concerned about taxpayers attemptingto justify low-royalty transfers at an early stage based on the purportedinability to predict subsequent product success.\177\<NOTE/> Because of this concern, it would be appropriate to imposea high standard of proof, such as a clear and convincing evidence standard,on taxpayers in order to demonstrate that subsequent profitability couldnot have been anticipated. In no event should this test be available totaxpayers if inexact comparable licenses with no provision for periodicadjustments cannot be found in the marketplace.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\177\ 1985 House Rep., <T3>supra </T3>n. 47, at 424.A substantial change in intangible income will not necessarily result inan adjustment. As dicussed in Chapter 6 and described in Chapter 11, determiningthe intangible income is merely the first step in the analysis of allocatingintangible income. The second step involves allocating income on the basisof the activities performed and economic costs and risks borne by the parties.If intangible income increases solely due to the efforts of the transferee,then the increase in intangible income will be allocated exclusively tothe transferee, and no adjustment will be made to the income of the transferor.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Periodic Review</ITAG>Annual adjustments may not be required to reach the appropriate amountof income under the commensurate with income standard. Adjustments arenot required for minor variations in intangible income, only for substantialchanges in intangible income.\178\<NOTE/> Several issues are raised by this requirement. How oftenshould the taxpayer review its transfer pricing structure to determinewhether income is being properly reported and to avoid potential penalties?How often may the Service make adjustments in the course of examination?Should the regulations define substantially? Should the adjustments beapplied retroactively or prospectively? Should periodic adjustments bemade in the case of a sale of intangibles and other situations involvinglump sum payments? Should set-offs be permitted?<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\178\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 426.The frequency with which a taxpayer should review its related party intangibletransfer agreements and how often the Service should be able to make adjustmentsare not questions that can be governed by inflexibles rules. When the transfereeexperiences a substantial change in its profits from the intangible resultingfrom some particular event (whether anticipated or not), a review by thetaxpayer is clearly warranted; further, an adjustment by the Service iswarranted unless the taxpayer can demonstrate, by clear and convincingevidence, that the conditions discussed above for avoiding an adjustmentbased on subsequent profit experience are met. Even absent a clear-cutevent, it is possible that gradual changes over time may create a substantialdeviation from the parties' expectations at the time they entered intothe contract.In general, taxpayers should review transfer pricing arrangements relatingto intangibles (especially high profit intangibles) as often as necessaryto assure that their transfer prices are consistent with substantial changesin intangible income that may have occurred since the inception of thecurrent transfer pricing arrangements. For industries that undergo rapidtechnological change or for products that have a relatively short life,this standard may dictate annual review. In short, the taxpayer shouldreview its pricing structure relating to intangibles as often and thoroughlyas necessary to assure that income is reported on its U.S. tax return ina manner that is consistent with the commensurate with income standard.Taxpayers that fail to do so risk the imposition of the substantial understatementor other appropriate penalty.\179\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\179\ As discussed <T3>supra </T3>in Chapter 3, the regulations or statute should be amendedto ensure adequate disclosure of transfer pricing methodology and penalizeunjustified substantial understatements of tax resulting from nonconformityto the arm's length standard.On the other hand, the Service should be permitted to make a transfer pricingadjustment without necessarily having to demonstrate that its proposedadjustment is justified by identifiable changes in intangible income comparedwith a prior taxable year. In other words, if the adjustment can be supportedon the basis of exact or inexact comparables, or on the basis of the rateof return analysis or such other methodology as is adopted by the Servicefor use in cases in which exact or inexact comparables to do not exist,\180\<NOTE/> then the Service should not have to demonstrate that theadjustment specifically relates to identifiable changes in intangible incomeoccurring since the last taxable year examined. An approach whereby theService would be estopped from making an adjustment, absent clearly identifiablechanges in intangible income, because of the Service's prior acceptanceof some commensurate with income amount in a prior year would present problemsof proof that are not necessarily relevant to the appropriateness of theadjustment. At most, consideration should be given only to requiring thatthe proposed adjustment to income be substantial in relation to the incomereported by the taxpayer from the transaction_and then only for auditssubsequent to the first in-depth audit of transfer prices conducted fortaxable years after 1986.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\180\ <T3>See infra </T3>Chapter 11.It may be advisable to publish in the Internal Revenue Manual a list offactors that, if one or more changes substantially, would indicate thatthere may be a substantial change in intangible income that may warrantan examination of the taxpayer's intangible transfer pricing. These factorsmight include: (a) The size and number of markets penetrated; (b) the product'smarket share; (c) the product's sales volume; (d) the product's sales revenue;(e) the number of uses for the technology; (f) improvements to the technology;(g) marketing expense; (h) production costs; (i) the services providedby each party in connection with the use of the intangible; and (j) theproduct's profit margin or the process' cost savings.\181\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\181\ <T3>See also </T3>the factors set forth in Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.482-2(d)(2)(iii).Any periodic adjustments that are made under the commensurate with incomestandard generally should be made prospectively_<T3>i.e., </T3>for the taxable year under audit and subsequent taxableyears (provided that there is no further substantial change in the intangibleincome and other relevant facts). Unless unrelated parties would have seta different royalty rate on the date of the transfer based upon expectationsof future high profitability or other facts known on the date of transfer,the arm's length standard would require only that the transfer price becommensurate with actual income_<T3>i.e., </T3>that the transfer price be changed only as the intangibleincome changes.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Lump Sum Payments</ITAG>As discussed in Chapter 6, the commensurate with income standard appliesto transfers of intangibles by sale or license for noncontingent, lumpsum amounts. Thus, periodic adjustments may be required under the commensuratewith income standard in the case of lump sum sale or royalty arrangementsas well as periodic royalty arrangements. In the case of a lump sum sale,how should the Service make a section 482 allocation if it is not apparentuntil many years after the sale that the lump sum payment was insufficientunder the commensurate with income standard?One possibility would be to recharacterize the sale as a license, therebygiving the Service the ability to require additional royalty payments sufficientto satisfy the commensurate with income standard. It is clear, however,that parties dealing at arm's length occasionally sell intangibles. Thus,failure to recognize sale arrangements for related party transactions couldbe viewed as a deviation from the arm's length standard.Alternatively, the Service could recognize the transfer as a sale but makea section 482 allocation to increase the initial lump sum payment. Unlesstaxpayers using lump sum sale arrangements were required by regulationor statute to keep the statute of limitations open for the payment year,the statute of limitations could bar adjustments to a lump sum paymentin closed taxable years, contrary to Congressional intent. Moreover, otherproblems would exist in adjusting the lump sum even if the statute of limitationswere open. For example, any mid-stream adjustment to the initial lump summade before the statute of limitations expires on the year of sale wouldnecessarily be based on a projection of future profits over the remaininglife of the intangible that could be too high or too low. Furthermore,any mechanism, whether elective or mandatory, that would keep the statuteof limitations for the year of transfer open for extended periods woulddisrupt the examination process by unduly delaying the closing of audits.A lump sum sale arrangement should instead be treated as an open transactionto assure that the sale over time satisfies commensurate with income standard.This approach is the only approach which recognizes the transaction asa sale, allows for adjustments of the sale price under the commensuratewith income standard, and minimizes the statute of limitation and otherproblems inherent in making adjustments to income in the year of the sale.Under this approach, a lump sum sale payment made in the year of the transferwould result in gain taxable in the year of transfer but would then betreated as a prepayment of the commensurate with income amounts. No section482 allocation would be required until the aggregate commensurate withincome amount exceed the prepayments.Under this method, the lump sum is treated as invested on the date of thelump sum payment in a hypothetical certificate of deposit (``C.D.'') maturingon the last day of taxpayer's current tax year bearing interest at theappropriate federal funds rate based on the anticipated life of the intangible(for U.S. developed intangibles) or the appropriate rate in the developmentcountry. At the end of year one the balance of the C.D. investment wouldbe computed. From this amount, the amount of the commensurate with incomeamount would be subtracted. The remaining balance would then be treatedas invested in a C.D. maturing at the end of year two. At the end of eachtax year a computation similar to that done at the end of year one wouldbe made. When the C.D. balance is exhaused, the taxpayer would be requiredthereafter to include the entire commensurate with income amount in incomeeach year.Consider, for example, an intangible that is transferred for $1,000 andthat would demand a commensurate with income amount in each of ten yearsas shown:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1> </H1><H1>Lump sum $1000 payment increased by time value return (assume 10%)at end of year (Col. 3 plus returns on Col. 3 amount)</H1><H1>Commensurate with Income (assumed)</H1><H1>Remaining lump sum payment at beginning of year (prior year Col. 1less prior year Col. 2)</H1><ITAG tagnum="25"> <D>Col. 1</D><D>Col. 2</D><D>Col. 3</D><R/></ITAG>Year:<ITAG tagnum="2">1<D>$1100</D><D>$100</D><D>$1000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">2<D>1100</D><D>100</D><D>1000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">3<D>1100</D><D>200</D><D>900</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">4<D>990</D><D>200</D><D>790</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">5<D>850</D><D>200</D><D>650</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">6<D>715</D><D>500</D><D>215</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">7<D>237</D><D>500</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">8<D/><D>500</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">9<D/><D>200</D><D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">10<D/><D>200</D><D>0</D></ITAG></ITAG>The $1,000 lump sum payment would be converted as shown in column 1 intoa stream of income which is offset by the commensurate with income amountin column 2 until the stream of income is exhausted in year 7. Thereafter,the commensurate with income amount would be fully included in the transferor'sincome.\1\\8\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\2\ It has been suggested that the commensurate withincome standard will result in all gains from the sale of intangibles beingtreated as royalties under the Internal Revenue Code and under our taxtreaties, because of the provision in the Code and those treaties coveringgains contingent on productivity, use or disposition of the relevant intangible.There is no intention by the Service or Treasury to eliminate the possibilityof sale treatment for transfers of intangibles in appropriate cases, eitherfor treaty purposes or for U.S. withholding tax purposes. Further, theService and Treasury believe that the mere fact that subsequent profitsmay be taken into account in appropriate cases by U.S. tax authoritiesin determining transfer prices on audits, or that a lump sum is treatedas a deposit on the appropriate section 482 transfer price in order toassure that a commensurate with income adjustment can be made notwithstandingthe statute of limitations, does not have this effect. The terms of thetransaction itself (<T3>i.e.</T3>, whether it provides for contingent consideration based,<T3>e.g.</T3>, on sales volume or units sold) will determine treatmentunder the royalty article. Further, even if the commensurate with incomestandard were incorporated by reference into the relevant sales document,there is no necessary relationship between productivity, use or dispositionand a proper commensurate with income payment. For example, sales mightincrease dramatically in a given year, but the method called for may resultin no increase in payments, or the taxpayer may have an arm's length basisfor making no adjustment.Because section 482 may be applied only by the Service, no refunds couldbe allowed if an excessive lump sum was paid. However, to prevent abuseof outbound lump sum payments in inbound licensing arrangements, the Servicewould be allowed to adjust excessive lump sum payments that clearly exceedthe commensurate with income standard.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Set-Offs in Royalty Arrangements</ITAG>It is possible that the initial royalty rate set by the parties could betoo large in some years and too small in other years when analyzed underthe commensurate with income standard. Under existing regulations, section482 adjustments traditionally have been made on a year-by-year basis. Onlyintra-year set-offs of proposed adjustments against excessive income derivedon related party transactions are authorized under andSection; 1.482-1(d)(3)of the regulations.\1\\8\\3\<NOTE/> Thus, the Service could make adjustments in some years withoutmaking an allowance for excessive royalties paid in other years. Assume,for example, that a license generates a fixed royalty amount on an intangiblethat produces fluctuating income due to business cycles or changes in demand.Over time, the royalty may be an appropriate one on average, but in someyears it may be too low and in others too high.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\3\ <T3>But see</T3> Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.482-2(d)(1)(ii)(d), Ex. 3, whichappears to allow an inter-year set-off.Because of the problems inherent in an open transaction approach, the currentrule prohibiting multi-year set-offs should be retained. The potentiallyharsh effect of this rule will be mitigated by the fact that periodic adjustmentsgenerally should be made only in cases of substantial changes in circumstancesand by the ability of taxpayers to adjust their own arrangements prospectively,reducing or increasing the royalty, to account for changed circumstances.It will also create an incentive for taxpayers to examine their arrangementsperiodically to see whether an adjustment favorable to them would be appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Conclusions</ITAG>1. Periodic adjustments are necessary in order to reflect substantial changesin the income stream produced by a transferred intangible, taking intoaccount the activities performed, assets employed, and economic costs andrisks borne by the related parties.2. Requiring periodic adjustments is consistent with the arm's length principle,since unrelated parties generally provide some mechanism to adjust forchange in the profitability of transferred intangibles and since actualprofit experience generally is the best indication available of the anticipatedprofit experience that unrelated parties would have taken into accountat the outset of the arrangement.3. Taxpayers should review transfer pricing arrangements relating to transferredintangibles as often and as thoroughly as necessary to assure that incomeis reported over time in a manner consistent with the commensurate withincome standard.4. Periodic adjustments made under the commensurate with income standardgenerally should be prospective unless a different royalty rate would havebeen set on the date of transfer based upon expectations of the partiesand the facts known as of the date of transfer.5. A lump sum sale of an intangible should be characterized as an opentransaction whereby the lump sum sale payment results in gain at the timeof transfer, but is then treated as a prepayment of the commensurate withincome amounts. No section 482 allocation would be required until the aggregatecommensurate with income amounts exceed the prepayment.6. Multi-year set-offs of proposed adjustments against excessive relatedparty income derived in other taxable years will not be permitted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter 9</ITAG>The Need for Certainty: Are Safe Harbors the Solution?<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Introduction</ITAG>One of the most consistent criticisms of the section 482 regulations isthat they do not provide taxpayers with enough certainty to establish intercompanyprices that will satisfy the Service without overpaying taxes. Based onthe government's experience in litigation, the current section 482 regulationsalso fail to provide the Service and the courts with sufficiently preciserules to make appropriate section 482 adjustments, especially when thirdparty comparables are not available.\1\\8\\4\<NOTE/> One of the most common suggestions for solving these problemsis to amend the section 482 regulations to adopt safe harbors, or simple,mechanical, bright-line tests that may be used in lieu of the fact-specificarm's length inquiry under section 482.\1\\8\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\184\ GAO, <T3>IRS Could Better Protect U.S. Tax Interests, supra </T3>n. 64, at 63;ABA Comm. on Affiliated and Related Corporations, <T3>Administrative Recommendation No. 8 </T3>(1986) [hereinafter ABA <T3>Admin.

General Problems With Safe Harbors</ITAG>While numerous safe harbors have been proposed, they generally have takentwo forms: (1) Absolute safe harbors that grant the taxpayer total freedomfrom a section 482 adjustment once the criteria for the safe harbor aresatisfied, and (2) conditional safe harbors that produce a rebuttable presumptionor a shift in the burden of proof in the taxpayer's favor, but that maybe overcome by the Service through evidence showing that a section 482adjustment is necessary.Although various types of safe harbors are available, they all have onecommon element that makes them both attractive to the taxpayer and potentiallytroublesome to the government: they generally would serve only to reducetax liability. Taxpayers for which a safe harbor would produce a lowertax liability than the appropriate normative rule would use it. Those forwhich a safe harbor would produce a higher tax liability than the appropriatenormative rule generally would not seek the protection of the safe harborbut would apply the normative rule. Reducing administrative costs, or theneed for certainty, may encourage some taxpayers to use a safe harbor inmarginal situations even if application of the normal rule would resultin a tax savings. In general, however, the only benefit a safe harbor offersfrom the Service's perspective is a savings of administrative costs.Ideally, safe harbor standards should be easy and inexpensive vehiclesfor selecting cases that warrant closer scrutiny. The perfect safe harborwould result in the elimination of all insignificant cases and the selectionof cases for detailed analysis by taxpayers and further examination bythe Service that would more likely produce sustainable, significant adjustmentsif analyzed incorrectly by the taxpayer. The question is whether thereare any safe harbors that are capable of approaching these goals.A look at the Service's experience with section 482 safe harbors is instructive.The best example is the safe harbor for interest rates found in andSection;1.482-2(a)(2)(iii). From the Service's point of view, results under thissafe harbor have been mixed at best. The safe harbor was originally setbetween 4 and 6 percent. This was probably sufficient in 1968, but it soonbecame inappropriately low. However, the government was very slow to changethe safe harbor range as interest rates rose.\1\\8\\6\<NOTE/> The safe harbor for interest now tracks the Federal ratesrequired to be determined for purposes of the original issue discount ruleunder section 1274(d), which reflect market rates and are adjusted monthly.While this is probably a satisfactory solution, many taxpayers were ableto gain a substantial windfall while the government made successive attemptsto choose an appropriate safe harbor rate.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\186\ The following changes have been made to the safe harborinterest rate: 6-8 percent effective January 1, 1976; 11-13 percent effectiveJuly 1, 1981; 100-130 percent of the applicable Federal rate effectiveMay 9, 1986. Final regulations were published on June 13, 1988. T.D. 8204,1988-24 I.R.B. 11.Another example of a safe harbor is found in andSection; 1.482-2(c)(2)(iii)of the regulations, which provides a safe harbor computation of an arm'slength rental for the use of tangible property. Experience has demonstratedthat this safe harbor was overly generous to taxpayers (<T3>i.e., </T3>requiring too little rent). It was repealed by regulationsfinalized this year.\1\\8\\7\<NOTE/> No substitute safe harbor has been provided to date.\1\\8\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\187\ T.D. 8204, 1988-24 I.R.B. 11.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\188\ <T3>See </T3>Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.482-2(c)(2)(ii).The government's experience in the section 482 area has been that safeharbors have generally treated amounts as arm's length that were usuallydifferent from market rates. This result is even more likely to occur inthe transfer pricing area because of the inherent difficulty of constructingvaluation safe harbors for the types of intangible and tangible propertythat have created transfer pricing problems under section 482 . Furthermore,because of the complexity of the regulatory process and the difficultyin obtaining reliable data, adjustments or corrections to safe harbor standardswould be slow. In any event, the fundamental deficiencies of safe harborsare not resolved by continually reviewing and revising the rates, or byintentionally setting the safe harbor on the conservative side for protectionof the revenue. If safe harbors are set at non-market rates, they willbe used only by taxpayers that will benefit by making or receiving paymentsat those rates.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Specific Proposals</ITAG>The following lists some of the safe harbors that have been proposed andincludes a short explanation of some of the reasons why they have not beenendorsed by the Service and Treasury.1. <T3>Pricing based on industry norms. </T3>This approach is contrary tothe legislative history of the section 482 changes in the 1986 Act.\1\\8\\9\<NOTE/> Industry norms generally do not reflect arm's length pricesfor highly profitable intangibles. Accordingly, any safe harbors basedon industry norms or statistics would permit transfer prices that wouldbe far different from the arm's length standard in the most significantcases.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\189\ 1985 House Rep., <T3>supra </T3>n. 47, at 424-25.2. <T3>Profit split_minimum U.S. profit. </T3>This approach would guaranteethat the United States would capture a certain minimum of the profit intransfer pricing cases, perhaps 50 percent. The commensurate with incomestandard is designed to divide the income involved between related partiesto ``reasonably reflect the relative economic activity undertaken by each.\1\\9\\0\<NOTE/> A safe harbor that splits profits a certain way in all caseswould be inconsistent with the case-by-case factual determination thatis necessary to measure the economic contribution made by each of the relatedparties. Furthermore, a fixed U.S. profit requirement would be objectionableto other countries when intangibles were developed outside the United States.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\190\ <T3>Id.</T3>3. <T3>Profit split based on taxpayer's proportionate share of combined costs(ABA Proposal).\191\</T3><NOTE/> The problem with this safe harbor is that it presumes thatdifferent types of expenses contribute equally to the combined profit.For example, expenses incurred for highly skilled technical services mightcontribute proportionately more to the combined profit than those incurredfor unskilled services. Furthermore, it might be very difficult to determinewhat indirect expenses (including, for example, research and developmentexpenses) are attributable to particular products, and taxpayers mightbe able to manipulate the profit split by shifting expenses from one productto another or one entity to another (such as by ``loaning'' employees).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\191\ ABA, <T3>Admin. Rec</T3>., <T3>supra</T3> n. 184, at 14. The ABA proposals are applicable only tothe transfer of tangible property. Other proposals apply only to intangibleproperty. Because many of the safe harbors would have the same advantagesand disadvantages regardless of the type of property involved, this discussiondoes not address the different types of property separately. 4. <T3>Profit split based on share of combined costs and assets (ABA Proposal)</T3>.\192\<NOTE/> The second ABA safe harbor is a modification of the firstone. Instead of relying entirely on relative expenses, it relies 50 percenton expenses, and 50 percent on the fair market value of the assets usedin the production of the property involved in the sale. However, at a minimumnot less than 25 percent of the combined taxable income would be allocatedto the buyer. If one of the parties employed its assets in a very inefficientmanner, it would nevertheless be rewarded in the same manner as if it werehighly efficient. Additionally, assets could be arbitrarily shifted fromone entity to another; difficult questions of property valuation couldarise; and property could be purchased just to tip the balance of profits.Because of those problems, a party could receive a substantial amount ofthe combined taxable income, yet be doing very little to earn the income.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\192\ <T3>Id</T3>. at 14-15. 5. <T3>Insubstantial tax benefit test</T3>. This safe harbor would be availableif the rate of tax in the foreign jurisdiction was at least 90 percentof the U.S. rate. The theory behind this safe harbor is that taxpayerswill use arm's length pricing if no overall tax savings result from doingotherwise. While this approach may have some pragmatic appeal, there arestill several problems with it. An adjustment under section 482 does notdepend on an intent to avoid taxes. Even if the taxpayer is overpayingits worldwide tax liability, if U.S. income is being understated, an adjustmentshould be made. Furthermore, as a policy matter the United States willnot cede its taxing jurisdiction to a foreign country other than by treaty.Accordingly, if a taxpayer intentionally or inadvertently shifts incometo a high tax jurisdiction it should be subject to a section 482 adjustmentwithout the benefit of a safe harbor. As a practical matter, however, theService proposes relatively few adjustments between a U.S.-based parentcompany and its affiliates located in another jurisdiction whose effectivetax rate is nearly the same or higher. Different problems are presentedby foreign-based parents and their U.S. affiliates. 6. <T3>Profit distribution test</T3>. This safe harbor would be satisfiedif at least 25 percent of the pre-royalty net profit of an affiliate wasdistributed to the parent. This test is directly contrary to the commensuratewith income concept. If an affiliate is responsible for only 10 percentof the economic activity in question it should not be able to keep up to75 percent of the profit involved. 7. <T3>Prior settlement test</T3>. Under this proposal, when the Service hadaccepted a specific pricing method in a prior examination, the burden wouldbe on the Service to show that the pricing method is unreasonable for thecurrent year. This safe harbor is unacceptable because there could be anynumber of reasons why the Service had accepted a particular pricing method.To force the Service to demonstrate that the previously agreed upon methodhas become unreasonable could help perpetuate an error or make it moredifficut to adjust to changing circumstances. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Burden-Shifting Safe Harbors</ITAG>Some of the safe harbor proposals would operate by shifting the burdenof proof to the Service. It has been proposed, for example, that a taxpayer'sfull disclosure of the method by which it determines its transfer priceswould shift the burden of proof to the government. (See Chapter 3, <T3>supra</T3>, for a description of IEs' experiences in seeking information.)Section 6001 requires all taxpayers to maintain adequate books and recordsto substantiate positions taken on the tax return, including section 482issues. Thus, a taxpayer could obtain a shift in the burden of proof merelyby complying with the law. The Service and Treasury do not believe that ``burden-shifting'' safe harborsare a viable approach. The critical issues presented in the section 482area are almost always factual in nature, and taxpayers are almost alwaysuniquely familiar with_and in exclusive possession of_the relevant facts.To place the burden of proof on the government in this situation wouldbe unworkable. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Conclusions and Recommendations </ITAG>1. Historical experience with safe harbors indicates that they generallyresult in unwarranted windfalls for taxpayers, without significant benefitsfor the government. 2. In the highly factual section 482 context, no one safe harbor or combinationof safe harbors has yet been proposed that would be useful but not potentiallyabusive. 3. While the possibility that useful safe harbors could be developed isnot categorically rejected, additional section 482 safe harbors are notrecommended at the present time. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. METHODS FOR VALUING TRANSFERS OF INTANGIBLES</ITAG>A significant reason for the enactment of the commensurate with incomestandard was the failure to properly take into account the income earnedby related parties in exploiting intangibles. As detailed in earlier chapters,inappropriate comparables or ad hoc profit split approaches have been usedto analyze cases involving related party transfers of unique intangibles.This part of the study seeks to define the appropriate use of comparabletransactions. It also proposes an alternative method of analysis that doesnot directly rely upon comparable transactions. Fourteen detailed examplesapplying the methods described in this part are set forth in Appendix E.These methods are generally consistent with various methods of income allocationused by the Service, taxpayers, and the courts under pre-1986 Act law and,if adopted, would appropriately be applicable to cases arising prior tothe 1986 Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter 10</ITAG>Economic Theories Concerning the Implementation of Section 482<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Introduction</ITAG>The current section 482 regulations use a market-based approach to incomeallocation. The goal of this approach is to distribute income in the sameway that the market would distribute the income; that is, related partiesshould earn the same returns that unrelated parties would earn under similarcircumstances. This approach is implemented through separate accountingin which an individual transfer price is determined for each transaction.\1\\9\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\3\ A variation of this approach retains the goal ofa market-based allocation but claims that in some situations the targetis best reached by an estimate, or that average prices can be used forcertain transactions. The estimate can be provided by some type of formularyapportionment.The argument for the market-based method to allocate income was articulatedby Stanley Surrey, former Assistant Secretary (Tax Policy), who discussedthe way that unrelated parties are taxed:<ITAG tagnum="21">Tax administrators do not question transactions that are governedby the marketplace. If Company A sells goods to unrelated Company B ata certain price or furnishes services at a particular price, the incomeof both companies is determined by using that price. One company may belarge and the other small; one may be a monopoly; one may be financiallystrong and the other in a weak condition. But these and other factors whichmay affect the price at which the transaction occurs are not the concernof the tax administrator.\1\\9\\4\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\4\ Surrey, <T3>Reflections on the Allocation of Income and Expenses Among NationalTax Jurisdictions,</T3> 10 Law and Policy in International Business 409,414 (1978).Having established the tax system's acceptance of the marketplace, he concludes:<ITAG tagnum="21">Presumably, most transactions are governed by the general frameworkof the marketplace and hence it is appropriate to seek to put intra-grouptransactions under that general framework. Thus, use of the standard ofarm's length, both to test the actual allocation of income and expenseresulting under controlled intra-group arrangements and to adjust thatallocation if it does not meet such standard, appears in theory to be aproper course.\1\\9\\5\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\5\ <T3>Id.</T3> at 414.Recent criticism has questioned whether the market-based arm's length approachis flawed as a matter of general principle. An alternative approach mightbe based on the concept of an integrated business. Loosely defined, anintegrated business consists of firms under common control and engagedin similar activities. Proponents of the alternative approach assert thatone cannot assume that related parties conduct market-based transactionswithin the entity. They claim that, because an entity will not act as ifits parts are unrelated, it does not make sense to try to account for individualtransactions in the way that unrelated parties subject to market forceswould account for similar transactions. Under this theory, the allocationof income can only be accomplished by applying some formula chosen by thegovernment.This chapter explores the tension between these alternative approaches,and suggests a way to apply the arm's length principle to an integratedbusiness. It concludes that the market-based arm's length approach remainsthe best theoretical allocation method.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. The Arm's Length Approach in an Integrated Business: Theory</ITAG>The goal of a market-based approach is to ensure that the return to aneconomic activity is allocated to the party performing the economic activity.Critics of the market-based approach argue that an arm's length price willnot achieve this goal. Relevant practical issues are how close one canget to the right price and whether getting that price is costly relativeto settling for an estimate.One commentator has suggested that the difficulties encountered in administeringthe current regulations stem not from practical considerations, but ratherfrom fundamental problems inherent in applying a market-based approachto transactions of integrated businesses.\1\\9\\6\<NOTE/> Specifically, it has been argued that the flaw in an arm'slength approach is that it does not allow a return to the form of organization.That is, because an integrated enterprise is presumably more efficient,it will be able to execute an integrated economic activity at a lower costthan a series of independent firms whose joint efforts are necessary toexecute the same series of transactions. This omission creates a ``continuumprice problem,'' a situation in which the sum of the returns for separateservices rendered by independent parties is less than the actual returnof the combined group. This argument grows out of the literature on thereasons for the existence of multinationals.\1\\9\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\6\ Langbein, <T3>supra </T3>n. 160, at 627.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\7\ Caves explains that many multinationals exist becauseof a failure in the market for intangibles. R. Caves, <T3>Multinational Enterprise and Economic Analysis </T3>(1982). In essence,intra-firm transactions can be more profitable than inter-firm transactionsbecause of the expense of negotiating complete contracts or the inabilityof a firm to capture the full value of a piece of knowledge through contractswith unrelated parties without fully explaining the knowledge and thuseliminating its value.That multinationals may exist because of integrated or ``firm-specific''economies does not require a rejection of the arm's length principle. Transferprices are supposed to reflect the contribution of the activity and assetsutilized in each location to economic income. Therefore, each party shouldearn at least as much as it could have earned as an unrelated party underalternative arrangements.Furthermore, an analysis of ``alternative arrangements'' need not be restrictedto analyzing conventional arm's length transactions. Consider a U.S. firmthat owns the worldwide rights to a unique patented drug that it wishesto sell into a new market (and assume that the drug or patent is valuablein its own right and that marketing activity, for example, is not an importantfactor). The firm could license the use of the patent to unrelated partiesto produce the drug in the new market. Alternatively, the firm could enterinto a joint venture by affiliating with a company that has the abilityto produce the drug. If the pharmaceutical firm entered into a joint ventureit would probably be able to negotiate a very large share of the profitsgiven the value of the patent, because any number of local firms couldprovide the labor and capital necessary to mix and package the drug.There are, therefore, two types of arm's length transactions to consider_onein which the parties remain independent and another in which the two partiesmake an arm's length agreement to affiliate by merger, joint venture, acquisition,or simply through the hiring of local labor and capital within a subsidiary.Restricting attention to transactions between parties that remain unrelatedcan fail to accomplish the objective of allocating to each party its contributionto income, if such transactions do not accurately reflect the actual relationsbetween the related parties.Another way of describing the arm's length agreements that have to be consideredis to say that they are the arrangements that would be made between unrelatedparties if they could choose to have the costs of related parties_<T3>i.e.,</T3> to use the related party technology. In general, tax rulesshould distort business decisions as little as possible because rules thatminimize such distortions will lead to the greatest possible productionefficiency. Transfer pricing rules will allow the most efficient productiontechnology to come to the fore if, holding the cost functions constant,they result in the same tax burdens whether or not the parties are related.In other words, if unrelated parties somehow had access to the technologyavailable to related parties, their operations should not result in moreor less total taxes than would be paid by a multinational using this technology.The difficulty, of course, is the practical application of this interpretationof the arm's length standard.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. The Arm's Length Approach in an Integrated Business: Practice</ITAG>The arm's length approach can be more correctly applied to an integratedbusiness by using certain tools of microeconomic theory. The continuumprice problem arises when a vertically or horizontally integrated productiontechnology that is available to multinational corporations results in lowercosts than a nonvertically or horizontally integrated technology, whichunrelated parties would have to use. How can an examination of unrelatedparty transactions lead to a satisfactory resolution of the transfer pricingproblems?As a first step, consider an industry in which there is no difference incosts between related party and unrelated party dealings; there is onlyone production technology, and it is available to the parties in both typesof arrangements. There is thus no continuum price problem, and the arm'slength standard, as traditionally interpreted, can be applied. It is likelythat both unrelated party and related party transactions will actuallyoccur in the marketplace, and it should be possible to observe prices fromthe former and use them to determine the incomes of each party in the latter.This procedure satisfies the objective described in section B above ofusing information about unrelated parties operating at arm's length todetermine the allocation of income in the related party setting. The relatedparties that sell intermediate goods will be given the same gross revenuesas the corresponding unrelated parties; related parties that purchase themwill have the same cost of goods sold as corresponding unrelated parties.Further, it has already been assumed that the two sets of parties operatein the same market and have the same cost structure; therefore, the externalprices and internal costs will be equal. Thus, the related parties willhave the same net taxable incomes as the corresponding unrelated parties.They should therefore have the same total tax burden as the unrelated partieswith which they are competing.Now return to the situation in which a vertically or horizontally-integratedtechnology, available only to multinational companies, is dominant. Ifmultinational corporations are able to produce at lower cost, then in thelong run it should be difficult for the smaller companies to continue inexistence. Therefore, arm's length prices may be unavailable. An appropriatetransfer pricing result will be achieved if each related party were assignedthe income that the corresponding unrelated party would earn, if the latterwere using the efficient cost structure.Microeconomic theory leads to an unambiguous and natural statement of whatthe income of unrelated parties should be in these circumstances. As longas the industry under analysis is competitive and the factors of productionare homogeneous and mobile between sectors, it is assumed that ``economic,''``excess,'' or ``above-normal'' profits will be zero in the long run.\1\\9\\8\<NOTE/> That is, each firm will earn just enough to be able to payfor the land, labor, capital, and other factors of production that it usesto produce its outputs.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\8\ For a narrative explanation of the zero profit condition,<T3>see</T3> R. Lipsey and P. Steiner, <T3>Economics</T3> 229-231 (6th ed. 1981). For a mathematical presentationof the implications of this condition, <T3>see</T3> J. Henderson and R. Quandt, <T3>Microeconomic Theory </T3>107-110 (3d ed. 1980).The zero economic profit concept does not state that taxable income shouldbe zero. If owners of the firm have supplied it with capital or other inputs,the firm should earn enough to be able to reward the shareholders for thesefactors; otherwise, the shareholders would be wise to find a better investment.Rather, the zero profit concept implies that in a competitive industrythere should be an equality between the gross revenues of a firm and thesummation of the market returns that are or could be earned by all of thefactors of production that the firm employs. If gross revenues were higherthan this amount, then the firm would be earning ``above-normal'' profits;the existence of ``above-normal'' profits would attract other firms toenter the industry until these ``above-normal'' profits disappeared throughcompetition. If gross revenues were lower than this amount, a firm wouldnot be able to earn enough to reward all of the factors it employs and,in the long run, would have to shrink or disappear.This equality between revenue and the sum of returns to each factor ofproduction may be used to determine the proper allocation of income amongthe related parties within the multinational. Specifically, subject tothe discussion in section D <T3>infra </T3>regarding monopoly situations and intangibles, one shouldmeasure the factors of production used by each related party and computethe returns that each one would earn on its best alternative use in themarketplace. The sum of these amounts yields total input returns that eachrelated party would have to earn if it were an unrelated enterprise. Thesum also equals the amount that the multinational enterprise would haveto pay an unrelated party to get it to produce the same outputs (employingthe same inputs and using the same technology) as the related party does.Attributing this gross income to each related party will result in itstax base being equal to the hypothetical unrelated party alternative; therefore,the tax burden will be equal. Thus, there will be no tax incentive or disincentiveto related party transactions. The theory discussed above implies that a competitive firm's gross revenue,which equals price times quantity of output, will be equal to the returnsthat the factors it employs could earn in the marketplace. The traditionalarm's length approach looks at the gross revenue side of this equation;the alternative procedure outlined above looks at the input side. It startsby identifying the factors of production employed by the firm, determiningthe returns that these factors would earn in the marketplace, and computingthe sum. In short, the traditional approach looks for the prices that thefirm's outputs would command in the marketplace, whereas the alternativeapproach seeks to determine the returns that the firm's factors would earnin the marketplace. Both approaches are equally consistent with the basicgoal of the arm's length principle, which is to use information about unrelatedparties operating at arm's length to determine the allocation of incomein a related party setting. <ITAG tagnum="81">Do. Further Practical Problems </ITAG>There are two further practical difficulties in applying the arm's lengthapproach to integrated business economies: application of the approachto monopoly situations and valuation of intangibles. This section brieflydescribes these difficulties and suggests possible approaches to solvingthem. 1. <T3>Monopoly situations. </T3>In a market that cannot be entered by morethan one for a few firms, the existence of ``above-normal'' profits cannotbe ruled out, because potential competitors will not be able to competethem away. The equality discussed above between gross revenue and the returnsthat factors could earn in the marketplace, and the results deried fromit, cannot then be assumed to hold. However, it may still be possible to apply the basic idea. For example,consider a situation in which a corporation has been granted worldwidepatent rights to a unique product. The company still can choose betweenexploiting this patent through related party or unrelated party dealings,and it would be worthwhile for this decision to be made free of distortionsthat could be caused by transfer pricing rules. To get an unrelated corporationto provide a good or service, the company would have to pay the unrelatedcorporation the sum of the returns that would be earned by the factorsit would employ. Therefore, it would still be proper to use the alternativeprocedure to determine the income of the related corporation.\1\\9\\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\\9\In more complicated situations, both the affiliatedcorporation and any potential unrelated party participant may each possessmonopoly rights that allow them to earn above-normal profits. In decidingwhether to use such an unrelated party, a corporation would have to considerwhat would happen if it attempted to bargain with it. There are analyses,relating to economic game theory, that attempt to predict what the rangeof outcomes would be in such a bilateral monopoly situation. If the outcome,specifically the income of the potential unrelated party, can be predicted,then it would be proper to use it to determine the income of the corporation'saffiliate. This is so, to repeat, because this procedure would allow thecorporation's choice between using an affiliate versus an unrelated partyto be made free of tax distortions. To implement this procedure, however,one would need to analyze the theoretical models of bargaining situationsin detail, and this analysis is beyond the scope of the present discussion.2. <T3>Valuation of intangibles. </T3>The starting point for the alternativeapplication of the arm's length approach is to measure the factors of productionemployed by the related parties, and to determine the returns that theywould earn in the marketplace. This procedure can be implemented in a straight-forwardfashion only if the factors can be identified and measured. However, there is at least one factor of production, intangible assets,for which it is often difficult to assign a precise value. These assetsare often unique and it is frequently difficult to decide what returnsthey would earn if separately employed in the marketplace.   One should not conclude that the presence of any intangible asset willmake the alternative procedure impossible to implement. It may be thatonly one of the related parties employs intangible assets to any significantdegree. In this situation it suffices to measure the factors of productionemployed by the party with measurable assets and to allocate the residualincome to the related party employing significant intangible assets. Ifboth parties employ intangible assets, valuation becomes more difficultand, in some cases, judgmental, but not impossible. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Conclusions</ITAG>1. The arm's length standard remains the theoretically preferable approachto income allocation Microeconomic theory can be utilized to apply thearm's length standard to an integrated operation. 2. In certain situations, production technologies may be such that unrelatedparties operating at arm's length can be expected to coexist with verticallyor horizontally integrated multinational corporations. In these cases,arm's length prices should exist and their application to related partytransactions should lead to appropriate results. This is the traditionalapproach embodied in the section 482 regulations. 3. In other situations, vertically or horizontally integrated technologiesavailable only in related party dealings may dominate. Third party priceswill be difficult to find in these cases; moreover, the use of the rarethird party prices that occur may be inappropriate. However, since informationmay exist as to the arm's length returns attributable to the factors ofproduction employed by one or both of the related parties, this informationcan be used to modify the traditional approach and take account of theintegrated businesses. <ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter 11</ITAG>Arm's Length Methods for Evaluating Transactions Involving Intangible Property<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Introduction </ITAG>This chapter discusses the methodology for implementing the arm's lengthprinciple for transactions involving intangible property. The goal of thechapter is to propose a theoretical framework for analyzing the situationsthat have caused the greatest amount of difficulty in the transfer pricingarea in order to generate further consideration of the difficult issuesinvolved. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Role of Comparable Transactions</ITAG>``Exact comparables,'' which are those involving the transfer of the sameintangible property, supply the best evidence of what unrelated partieswould do in a related party transaction. The weight to be given to evidenceof ``inexact'' comparables, which generally are those involving differentbut economically similar intangible property, is not so clear. Nor is theresort to inexact comparables automatically justified by the arm's lengthprinciple. This section first outlines the standards for exact comparables.It then discusses the appropriate role for inexact ones. 1. <T3>Exact comparables: two examples. </T3>Exact comparables are most likelyto occur in connection with the transfer of common products that embodyintangibles that are widely available to producers, such as the once uniquetechnology now employed in pocket calculators, digital watches, or microwaveovens. Comparability in such cases of widely available technology is usuallyeasy to demonstrate. The existence of an exact comparable for unique intangible property, however,is not inconceivable. Consider a multinational company that acquires anunrelated company whose only assets are a small amount of cash, equipment,and the rights to a valuable new invention. If, immediately after thisacquisition, the multinational sells those rights to a subsidiary, therereally can be no question as to the proper transfer price: It is the acquisitionprice minus the cash and value of the equipment. In fact, because thiscomparable is available, any other arrangement could be held suspect. Assumefurther that the subsidiary and the parent have no other transactions inthe initial and following years. The subsidiary's income should includethe return to the intangible in all future years, assuming that the subsidiarypaid the arm's length consideration at the time of the initial transfer.As a second example, consider a U.S. corporation that decides to exploitone of its intangibles. It sets up a Mexican subsidiary to serve the LatinAmerican market, while it licenses the Asian rights to an unrelated Koreancompany. Assume further that the Asian and Latin American markets, andthe parent's dealing between the Korean company and the Mexican subsidiary,are comparable in all important aspects. The Korean licensing arrangementshould determine the Latin American subsidiary's allocation of income fromthe transfer of the intangible.2. <T3>Standards for Exact Comparables. </T3>The assumptions made in theseexamples raise the crucial question: How is one to know if a potentialcomparable is indeed exact? The first requirement is that the comparabletransaction involve the same intangible property transferred under substantiallysimilar circumstances. Thus, an exact comparable should involve the samepatent, product design, process, trademark, or other intangible transferredto the related party. However, licenses of intangibles are usually exclusive. Therefore, it isextremely unlikely that the same intangible would be licensed to two differentparties for the same use and geographic market. The standards for exactcomparables should not require these aspects to be identical. Instead, two types of additional standards should be met. First, the comparabletransaction and the related party arrangement must take place in substantiallysimilar economic environments; these standards may be called ``external''ones. Second, the transactions must contain substantially similar contractualfeatures; they must satisfy ``internal'' standards of comparability. No amount of general discussion of these standards is likely to turn theminto objective tests. As in all matters concerning transfer pricing, factsand circumstances must determine the outcome of specific cases. The followingobservations, however, may suggest some useful guidelines. <T3>a. ``External'' standards. </T3>In examining external standards, theessential question is whether unrelated parties would regard the economicenvironment of the transaction under examination as similar to that ofthe proposed comparable transaction. In other words, would unrelated partiesearn substantially similar profits from a substantially similar transaction?For example, the size and level of economic development of the marketsshould be substantially similar.\2\\0\\0\<NOTE/> If one market is much larger, or if the product is alreadyaccepted in one market and not the other, one can presume that unrelatedparties would not arrive at the same arrangements to license an intangibleinto these two markets. As another example, one market may contain manycompetitors, but in the other a licensee can expect to have a monopolyfor a number of years. Again, it is reasonable to conclude that unrelatedparties would come to different terms in negotiating licenses for thesemarkets. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\\0\ Rev. Rul. 87-71, 1987-2 C.B. 148. Another set of external standards concerns transactions between the licensorand licensee that are collateral to the transfer of the intangible in question.If the parties to one transaction have substantial dealings in the intangiblewith third parties (such as a cross-licensing arrangement) but the partiesto the other set of transactions do not, external standards of comparabilityare not satisfied. There are clearly reasons why unrelated parties willreach different outcomes if they expect to have further dealings than ifthey do not. For example, an isolated exchange should not be taken as exactlycomparable to a continuing transactional relationship. The comprable usedin the <T3>U.S. Steel</T3> decision \2\\0\\1\<NOTE/> has been criticized on this basis. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\\1\ <T3>See</T3> discussion <T3>supra</T3> Chapter 4. Finally, the level of economic risks being assumed and the functions performedby each party must be similar. Clearly, it would be inappropriate to comparea related party transaction where the affiliate engages solely in manufacturinga product with a transaction in which the unrelated party not only manufacturesbut also must market the product. <T3>b. ``Internal'' standards. </T3>To meet this set of standards, thecontractual aspects of the transactions being compared must be substantiallysimilar in all important aspects. The most obvious ones include the amountand form of compensation for the transferred intangible. The most commoncompensation form is a royalty determined as a percentage of sales or quantityproduced, but, as Appendix D discusses, other forms are sometimes used.If the comparable transaction contains accelerator or decelerator clausesunder which the royalty increases or decreases as sales increase, for example,such clauses should appear in the related party transaction. Other elementsof a transaction can have a significant effect on the income realized byunrelated parties to a license or similar agreement. These elements mustbe substantially similar in order for the unrelated party transaction tobe an exact comparable. For example, if the unrelated party agreement providesfor the licensee to receive a specified level of technical assistance andtraining, the related party transaction should contain similar rights.Similarly, if one agreement calls for the licensee to perform significantmarketing or product development, while in the other the licensor performsthe marketing, the agreements lack internal comparability. 3. <T3>Exact comparables and periodic adjustments. </T3>A comparable thatis exact at the outset of a transaction may lose its exactness over time.There should therefore be two requirements of continued use of the exactcomparable over time. First, the arrangements must be consistent in theirprovision for options and other types of contingency clauses so that theyprovide for substantially the same types and amounts of adjustments forchanging circumstances. Second, the comparables will not remain exact overtime unless related parties perform these adjustments as unrelated partiesdo, under circumstances that are comparable. Is the concept of an exact comparable so rigid that the results of relatedparty and unrelated party agreements must be the same? Consider a U.S.company that licenses an intangible to two unrelated parties, one in Asiaand one in Latin America. It is reasonable to predict that the arrangementswill be similar if the economic environments are similar. However, it willprobably not be the case that the U.S. company will realize the same incomefrom the two transactions in every year. Business cycles, for example,vary across locations over time. The Asian licensee may have a very profitableexperience when times are ``lean'' in Latin America, or vice versa. The standards for exact comparables should not require year-by-year equalitybetween the results of the unrelated party arrangement and of the relatedparty one if it is reasonable to conclude that the long-term results willbe comparable. Related parties should not be required to exercise rightsthey might have, if unrelated parties do not in fact exercise them. 4. <T3>The role of inexact comparables. </T3>This section describes the appropriaterole for unrelated party transactions that cannot satisfy one or more ofthe standards for exact comparables. Because of the unpredictable outcomesthat inexact comparables have caused in the past, one might argue thatthey simply should not be used. However, the data presented in AppendixA suggests that some continued use of inexact comparables would be appropriate.The International Examiners reported that they made some use of comparablesin making transfer pricing adjustments 75 percent of the time.\2\\0\\2\<NOTE/> Although the reported use of comparables for transfers ofintangibles in general was lower, it was higher (76.5 percent) for marketingintangibles.\2\\0\\3\<NOTE/> The IEs did not report making final determinations basedsolely on these comparables in all these cases, but that they made someuse of them. Clearly, in practice, inexact comparable transactions providesignificant information, even with respect to transfers of intangible property.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\\2\ Appendix A, <T3>infra. </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\\3\ <T3>Id. </T3>The problem, therefore, is not that inexact comparables are useless ormisleading. Rather, either they have been given too much emphasis in manycases or inappropriate comparables have been used. This proper conclusionis that it is appropriate to make use of them, but that it is inappropriateto determine transfer prices solely on the basis of inexact comparables.This conclusion is fully consistent with the arm's length principle. Thearm's length approach requires that exact comparables, when they are available,should determine transfer pricing allocations of income. However, it doesnot follow that the same is true of inexact comparables. That is, inexactcomparables should be resorted to only when exact comparables are unavailable.Further, they should not be given priority over the alternative methodoutlined in section C of this chapter in all cases. 5. <T3>Selection of appropriate inexact comparables. </T3>Once it is determinedthat an exact comparable does not exist, how should inexact comparablesbe selected? The most obvious point is that the external and internal standardsdiscussed previously should parallel those in the transaction at issueas closely as possible. For example, if the unrelated parties in the potentialcomparable operate in a very different economic environment_if the marketis much smaller or the related parties carry on a much broader set of transactions_thenthe comparable should not be used to justify the related party arrangement.Similarly, if the intangible in the unrelated party transaction is at avery different stage of development or concerns a dissimilar product orservice, then its use as a comparable is inappropriate. In more traditional terms, an unrelated party arrangement should be usedas an inexact comparable if the differences between it and the relatedparty transaction can be reflected by a reasonable number of adjustmentsthat have definite and ascertainable effects on the terms of the arrangement.The current regulations for section 482, although silent on this issuein connection with transfers of intangible property, discuss it quite carefullyin connection with transfers of tangible property. They mention that adjustinga sale for differences in transportation costs or minor physical modificationswould probably be appropriate, but that an adjustment for the presenceor absence of a trademark would not.\204\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\208\ Treas. Reg. andSection;1.482-2(e)(2)(ii). This approach should be extended to transfers of intangible property. Forexample, unrelated party arrangements frequently require the licensor toprovide a specified amount of training or expert assistance to the licenseefor a brief period.\205\<NOTE/> It may be possible to adjust a comparable that includes sucha provision by comparing it with an arrangement that does not, or thatprovides for less assistance. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\205\ <T3>See infra </T3>Appendix D for further discussion of unrelated partylicenses. At the other extreme, consider an attempt to compare an unrelated partylicense with a related party license when the unrelated party licenseeperforms different functions than the related party licensee. For example,the former may be responsible for substantial marketing, while the lattermay not. It seems clear that the effect of this difference would not bedefinite and ascertainable. Therefore, an adjustment for it would be toospeculative to be appropriate. Similarly, intangibles differ in their fundamental profitability. Attemptingto compare a low-profit intangible to a high-profit one by adjusting forthis difference would clearly be too speculative to be appropriate. Comparabletransactions involving intangibles that are likely to be of typical oraverage profitability are therefore appropriate inexact comparables onlyif the related party intangible under analysis is typical or average. The current regulations contain a list of twelve factors which are essentiallyinternal and external standards that might be examined in order to determinewhether an unrelated party license is an appropriate inexact comparable.As many observers have pointed out, however, it is difficult to deriveuseful guidance from this list, because it does not discuss the relativeweights to be placed on the factors in a given situation. For example,prospective profits to be realized from the intangible appears late inthe list, but after the 1986 Tax Reform Act this factor must be given specialconsideration. In contrast, the first listed item cites prevailing industryrates, which should not be relied upon unless the intangible being transferredis demonstrably average, based on observable indicators of profitability.Another approach that provides a framework for use of inexact comparablesis ``functional analysis.'' Although not explicitly mentioned in the regulations,this procedure is outlined in the IRS Manual \206\<NOTE/> and has been found to be a useful place to start in transferpricing situations. In essence, the goal of functional analysis is to identifythe economic activities actually undertaken or to be undertaken by theparties in both the related party situation and unrelated party situation.The most appropriate comparables may be chosen by identifying the onesin which the unrelated parties carry on the same major economic activitiesas the related parties. Section C of this chapter examines functional analysisin the context of the arm's length rate of return method. Functional analysisis an equally valid approach for analyzing comparables on the basis ofthe similarity between the economic activities performed.\207\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\206\ I.R.M. andSection;600 <T3>et seq. </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\207\ As Appendix D stresses, it is insufficient merely toreplicate a royalty rate in order to achieve a comparable license. Forexample, the technological services provided by the licensor may have alarge impact on the profitability of the license from the licensor's perspective.6. <T3>Use of inexact comparables and periodic adjustments.</T3> It is inappropriateto use inexact comparables to justify a related party transaction merelyby analyzing similarities at the time of the initial transfer. For example,there may be valid inexact comparables that justify the establishment ofa related party agreement with a fifteen percent royalty rate. These comparablesmay further justify fixing this rate for two years. Even if no adjustmentwere required during the first two years, in year three the taxpayer maynot continue to rely upon the prior inexact comparables unless, after re-examination,use of these comparables remains appropriate. Suppose a significant change occurs during the term of a license agreement.For example, suppose a taxpayer licenses a product design to a relatedparty. At the time of the transfer, the taxpayer makes a good faith estimatethat the product will be a routine one, and will attain 10-25 percent ofits market. Based on this fact, the taxpayer gathers information on comparabletransactions (none of which can meet the standards for an exact comparable).The information indicates that a royalty rate of 10 percent of sales isappropriate. The comparables contain varying duration and contingency clauses.In year three, the product design becomes uniquely popular and garners95 percent of the market. Given this set of facts, the inexact comparablespreviously used may no longer be used in year three and succeeding yearsto justify the 10% related party royalty rate.\2\\0\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\\8\ There may be other cases where the taxpayer candemonstrate an arm's length basis for continuing to use inexact comparables.<T3>See</T3> discussion <T3>infra</T3> Chapter 8 regarding periodic adjustments. Although unlikely, the taxpayer may find inexact comparables involvingproducts with a 95 percent market share that demonstrate that the 10 percentroyalty rate is still appropriate. More realistically, suppose that thereare comparables that show that products in the taxpayer's industry witha 95 percent market share typically command a much higher royalty, or,as may be more likely, that there are no comparables for such a situation.In such case, the taxpayer must use the arm's length return method outlinedin section C below either to justify the royalty rate previously set orto adjust the related party arrangement to bring it into compliance withthe results of this new analysis.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. An Arm's Length Return Method </ITAG>The previous chapter discusses why a method that looks to arm's lengthreturns, as distinct from arm's length prices, is appropriate. This sectiondiscusses how such a method should operate. Although some of the terminologyin this section may be new, most of the techniques discussed in it arenot. One of the main arguments for the development of an arm's length returnmethod, in fact, is that taxpayers, the Service, and especially the courtshave found it necessary to use ad hoc and incompletely developed versionsof such a method in the past and will undoubtedly continue to do so inthe future. Therefore, the goal of this discussion is to lay a foundationfor this approach so that it may be used to achieve more consistent andsatisfactory results.1. <T3>Basic arm's length return method</T3>_a. <T3>General description.</T3> Consider a U.S. company, Widgetco, that holdsworldwide patent rights to the widget, a high-tech light gathering devicethat is expected to be a vital component in certain satellites and scientificinstruments. Widgetco intends to exploit this patent in the following way.A foreign affiliate will manufacture the widgets, under license from Widgetco.Besides utilizing the license, Widgetco and the affiliate will engage inthe following transactions. Widgetco will sell various types of microchips,seals and filters to the affiliate, which will also buy some of these productsfrom unrelated suppliers. The affiliate will use these components to manufacturethe widgets and sell them to Widgetco, which will market and distributethem. Widgetco maintains a research staff that developed the widget andwill continue to try to improve it. It would be very difficult to depend purely on comparable transactions,as traditionally defined, to establish the proper allocation of incomein this sort of ``round trip'' transfer-pricing situation. There are threeseparate types of comparables that would have to be found. The first isa set of prices for the components the parent will sell to the affiliate.The second is the royalty that the affiliate should pay to the parent underthe production license. The third is the transfer price for the finishedwidgets. Although it may be possible to find exact comparables for oneof these types of transactions, such as the purchase price of some of thecomponents, it will in general be impossible to find comparables for allthree. Further, finding an answer to only one aspect of the problem provideslittle help in deciding the proper allocation of income between the relatedparties. Another approach would be to try to find one or more comparable transactionsin which a company contracts with an unrelated party to manufacture a productsimilar to the widget. It is likely that these transactions will not begood inexact comparables. In general, the form, risks, and extent of relationshipsin the related party case will at least appear to be quite different fromthose in a contract manufacturer transaction. Among other things, the foreignaffiliate carries raw material, work-in process, and finished goods inventoriesand should receive a normal market return on its activities that reflectsits investment in such assets and the moderate risk that manufacturersusing routine manufacturing processes bear with respect to their investmentin manufacturing facilities and inventories. Using the terminology of theprevious section, a contract manufacturer transaction is likely to failboth the external and internal standards for inexact comparables, becauseboth the types of transactions between the parties and the terms of theiragreements will differ. While comparables of this type should not be discardedfrom all consideration (because this type of comparable may provide usefulinformation), it would be improper to base a resolution of the transferpricing issue solely on such information.An arm's length return approach would start from a different perspective.It would seek to identify the assets and other factors of production thatwill be used by the related parties in the relevant line of business andwould try to assign market returns to them.   The first step in this process is to perform a functional analysis_<T3>i.e., </T3> to break down each line of business into its componentactivities or functions. It should then be possible to identify which ofthe functions utilize only factors of production that can be measured andassigned market returns and those which do not. In most cases, identifyingfunctions with measurable factors will lead to distinguishing between thosefunctions that make significant use of preexisting intangible assets andthose that do not. In Widgetco's case, Widgetco owns several types of assetsthat are difficult to measure, including the widget patent and other manufacturingintangibles, the ongoing enterprise value of the research staff, and themarketing intangibles. On the other hand, the foreign affiliate utilizedmeasurable factors of production, assuming that the manufacturing processis a routine one. Specifically, the affiliate employs labor, plant, equipment,working capital, and what might be called ``routine'' manufacturing intangibles_<T3>i.e., </T3>know-how related to efficiency in routine manufacturingprocesses that most manufacturers develop through experience. Since itis easier to evaluate the factors of production to be used by the foreignaffiliate, the market rate of return analysis will focus on the affiliate.As the theoretical analysis in the previous chapter demonstrates, focusingon the return of the affiliate in this manner is a valid extension of thearm's length principle.   Next, income should be assigned to each of the functions with measurablefactors_here the functions performed by the affiliate. The reason for identifyingmeasurable factors (and, therefore, focusing on the affiliate) is thatthe functions that employ measurable factors will probably be carried onby a wide range of unrelated parties for which information will probablybe available regarding market returns earned by them. A market return consistentwith the returns of unrelated parties can be assigned to each of the affiliate'sfunctions since they all employ measurable factors. Once returns are identifiedfor all of the affiliate's functions, the residual income from the lineof business is then allocated to Widgetco.   Assume, as stated, that the only function to be performed by Widgetco'sforeign affiliate is manufacturing and that this function does not involvethe significant use of intangible property developed by the affiliate orpurchased by it from unrelated parties. Under the rate of return methodthe assets of the foreign affiliate would be divided into liquid workingcapital and all other assets (<T3>i.e., </T3>the production assets). The actual return on the liquidworking capital will be identified and allocated to the foreign affiliate.Rates of return on production assets used in similar manufacturing activitiesof similar risk must be identified or estimated.\2\\0\\9\<NOTE/> Income will then be allocated to the affiliate for its manufacturingactivity in an amount equal to the identified or estimated rate of returnas applied to its production assets. This rate of return would include,by definition, a return on routine manufacturing intangibles that manufacturerscommonly possess as well as a return for assuming normal business risksthat manufacturers bear with respect to their investment in manufacturingfacilities and inventories.\2\\1\\0\<NOTE/> The residual amount of income from the line of business isallocated to Widgetco.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\\9\ Because manufacturing is a broad category, the functionor activity would be defined more precisely. An example might be ``mediuminstrumentation fabrication, assembly, and testing.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\0\ <T3>See </T3>discussion of risk <T3>infra </T3>section E.   The same allocation would be made to the foreign affiliate if it sold itsoutput to a second affiliate and not back to Widgetco. In neither casewould the foreign affiliate receive a return from marketing its product.  b. <T3>Use of arm's length information. </T3>There are two ways that arm'slength information can be used to allocate income to the activities ofthe Widgetco manufacturing affiliate. The first method has been previouslydescribed_to identify the unrelated parties' rates of return on assetsutilized in a particular function, taking into account only the non-liquidassets relevant to the function in the line of business being examined.If satisfactory measures of the unrelated parties' assets are available,it should be possible to calculate an appropriate rate of return for eachfunction and apply it to the related party's assets utilized in that function.  The second way to use the arm's length information is to measure it againsta yardstick other than rates of return on assets. A common alternativeis the ratio of income to operating costs. For example, in the <T3>DuPont </T3>case,\2\\1\\1\<NOTE/> and expert witness, Dr. Charles Berry, computed the ratioof gross income before reduction by operating costs and interest to operatingcosts for DISA, DuPont's Swiss affiliate, and for a number of unrelatedparties performing similar functions. This analysis is useful to measurereturns on service activities and in other situations where assets aredifficult to measure consistently or, more generally, where there is reasonto believe that the relationship between income and costs is more stableor easier to measure than the relationship between income and assets. Asis true with assets, it is important to consider the types of costs andtheir relationships to income earned, not just the totals. For example,some analysts have used the ratio of gross income to ``above the line''costs. This approach is suspect if the unrelated parties incur proportionatelylarger amounts of ``below the line'' costs, such as advertising, than therelated affiliate incurs.<T3/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\1\ <T3>See </T3>discussion <T3>supra </T3>Chapter 4.   The use of both types of unrelated party information is consistent withthe fundamental goal of the basic arm's length return method, which isto use information about unrelated parties to determine the returns thatwould have been earned had the related parties' activities been undertakenat arm's length. Therefore, both approaches are potentially applicabledepending upon the availability of either type of information and the appropriatenessof using either type of information in the particular circumstances.  c. <T3>Applicability of basic arm's length return method. </T3>The basic arm'slength return method should have wide, but not universal, applicabilityin situations where exact or inexact comparable transactions are not available.It will not be sufficient alone, however, when both of the related partiesown preexisting and significant intangible assets that are vital to thesuccess of the project_for example, if Widgetco's foreign affiliate activelymarkets the products it manufactures in a manner that utilizes signifcantself-developed marketing intangibles. In such cases, it will be difficultto find a set of unrelated parties that possess the same type and amountof intangible assets as the affiliate and are thus able to perform thesame activities. It will be difficult, therefore, to obtain the arm's lengthinformation needed to assign a return to either affiliate's activities.This discussion is not meant to imply, however, that the basic arm's lengthreturn method is to be avoided whenever an affiliate possesses any amountof intangible assets. It is unlikely, for example, that any manufacturingoperation is so simple that it does not involve the use of some intangibles.An affiliate engaged only in manufacturing may employ a skilled labor force,and the efforts expended in recruiting and training it may create at leastsome amount of going concern type of intangible. Further, the affiliate'sexperience in producing the parent's designs may lead to the developmentof some amount of know-how. These facts alone, however, should not preventthe application of the basic method. The reason is that unrelated partiesperforming similar activities, will, in general, possess these types of``routine'' intangibles. Therefore, by measuring the return on assets thatunrelated parties earn for performing similar activities and bearing similarrisks, the basic method will automatically capture the returns earned bythese ``routine'' intangibles and will properly attribute them to the affiliate.It is only when the affiliate owns some type of intangible that is of majorimportance to the enterprise, and which few unrelated parties possess,that the basic method is insufficent standing alone to resolve the issue.The basic arm's length return method will probably be appropriate for mostmanufacturing affiliates. It should be possible to observe the rates ofreturn on assets or ratios of income to costs that are earned by unrelatedparties performing similar manufacturing activities involving similar risksand amounts of routine intangibles. It is possible to think of exceptions,however, Consider a corporation that has assembled a large and valuableteam of engineers and skilled craftsmen within a European subsidiary inorder to develop or perfect a complex manufacturing process. If no or fewunrelated parties would be capable of performing this development activity,the basic arm's length return method will not be sufficient standing aloneto resolve the case.Similarly, the basic method will be applicable to many distribution andmarketing affiliates. An affiliate that sets up and maintains a distributionnetwork undoubtedly possesses a going concern intangible; an affiliatethat markets products to industrial customers by participating in tradeshows and maintaining a staff of salespersons undoubtedly possesses someamount of know-how. However, it seems likely that these sorts of activitiesare undertaken by unrelated parties that possess similar amounts of goingconcern value and know-how. Therefore, it should be possible to determinethe arm's length returns on assets for these activities, which will includethe appropriate returns to these ``routine'' intangibles. In other situations,however, the basic method alone will not suffice.2. <T3>Profit split addition to the basic arm's length return method. </T3>Althoughthe basic arm's length return method should be widely applicable, thereare situations in which its use alone will clearly be inadequate. A largemultinational corporation may have foreign subsidiaries that have research,marketing, planning, manufacturing, and other divisions that are as largeand active as those of all but the biggest U.S. companies. Therefore, theseaffiliates may perform complex functions, take significant risks and ownsignificant intangible assets equal to those of the typical parent corporation.If so, the basic arm's length return method would be impossible to applybecause exact or inexact comparables, or rates of returns, for these complexfunctions are generally unavailable.Consider Teachem, a U.S. company that is a world leader in designing andproducing educational toys. It serves its major overseas market, WesternEurope, through a French sales affiliate, Enseignerem. Teachem is planningto license a new set of designs to Enseignerem, who will modify them inminor ways, such as translating the instructions and markings, and whowill hire local contract manufacturers to produce them. Enseignerem willutilize its own trademark and be responsible for all aspects of marketingand distribution in Europe. It will decide which of the toys to includein its line, set its own advertising budget, and design campaigns to promotethe new line and its Enseignerem trademark. It also maintains a sales forceand distribution network. Teachem maintains a research and testing staffto develop new products. The affiliate does not.Assume further that Teachem has a business policy of not licensing itsdesigns to unrelated parties. Exact comparables will therefore be absent,and inexact comparables may be difficult to find. How would an arm's lengthreturn approach be applied to determine the appropriate royalty rate tobe paid by Enseignerem for the use of Teachem's designs? The first stepis to identify the functions performed by the parent and the subsidiaryin the line of business in which the licensed designs are used (the saleof new toy designs in the European market). The parent should be allocatedthe returns on the basic product designs, while the subsidiary is entitledto the returns to be earned by its trademarks, marketing efforts, and distributionnetwork, plus any intangibles related to the modifications.The next step is to identify the functions that employ measurable factors_<T3>i.e., </T3>activities that do not involve the use of significant intangibleassets. These activities should be analyzed using the basic arm's lengthreturn method. Enseignerem's distribution and manufacturing activitiesmay be examples. It should be possible to find unrelated parties that performthese types of activities and incur similar business risks. Thus, it shouldbe possible to determine an arm's length rates of return on assets (orincome-to-costs ratio) for each activity and apply the arm's length rateor ratio to the appropriate related party factors. The resulting incomeshould then be allocated to the party performing the activity. In thiscase, income attributable to distribution and manufacturing activitieswould be allocated to Enseignerem. If the parent corporation performs oris to perform routine activities involving the line of business, they tooshould be analyzed using the basic method.These two steps will leave a quantity of income not yet allocated and aset of activities involving significant intangible assets not yet accountedfor. The goal of the first two steps is to isolate the income that is attributableto the significant intangible assets owned by the corporate groups as awhole and used in the line of business in question_primarily the designsowned by Teachem and the marketing intangibles (including the trademark)owned by Enseignerem.  The goal of the remaining step is to identify the intangible income attributableto the relevant line of business and then split that income according tothe relative value that the marketplace would put on each party's significantintangible assets had they been employed by unrelated parties operatingat arm's length. The intangible income is equal to the combined net incomefrom the line of business less the income allotted under the prior stepsto functions with measurable factors_<T3>i.e.</T3>, the residual combined net income determined after applyingthe basic rate of return method to activities with measurable factors ofthe parties. In splitting the residual amount between the related parties,it is not necessary to place a specific value on each party's intangibleassets, only a relative value. Of course, it is easier to state this principlethan to describe in detail how it is to be applied in practice. In manycases, there will be little or no unrelated party information that willbe useful in determining how the split would be determined in an arm'slength setting. Furthermore, the costs of developing intangibles, evenif known, may bear no relationship to value, especially in the case oflegally protected intangibles, and generally should not be used to assignrelative values to the parties' intangible assets. Splitting the intangibleincome in such cases will largely be a matter of judgment. There are twopossible sources of arm's length information, however.  First, it may be possible to find unrelated parties that engage in similaractivities and that use similar intangibles. The unrelated party transactionsmust be economically similar, of course, including the level of economicrisks assumed. It would be inappropriate to use a profit split derivedfrom a situation in which the unrelated parties' intangibles were muchless (or more) profitable than those owned by the related parties. Further,it would be inappropriate to compare the split derived from a transactionin which an unrelated party conducted only wholesale level marketing, forexample, with a related party situation in which an affiliate markets productsto consumers. These requirements resemble the standards discussed abovefor inexact comparables. The analysis of unrelated party profit splitsshould explain the relationship between the observed profit splits andthe overall profitability of the significant intangibles involved witha reasonable degree of accuracy. It is also necessary to analyze the functionsthat the unrelated licensors and licensees perform and the risks that theybear. Comments in this area should focus on how such an analysis can beimplemented.  Second, in come circumstances, a taxpayer may have arm's length evidenceof the value of its own or its affiliate's intangibles. For example, ataxpayer may have recently purchased its affiliate and may have some basisfor determining the value of the intangible assets using the purchase price. 3. <T3>Arm's length return method and periodic adjustments.</T3> Issues involvingperiodic adjustments are easier to analyze for the arm's length returnmethod than for the methods involving comparable transactions. Becausethe basic arm's length return method looks to the factors of productionused by the parties, the income allocation should adjust as the factorschange. Thus, as an affiliate's plant, equipment, and other measurablefactors change from the projections in the initial analysis, the incomeallocated to them should change. Similarly, the profit split percentageis intended to reflect the relative values of significant intangible assetsowned by the parties. When the value of intangibles belonging to one ofthe parties has changed, the percentage should be changed. For example,a dramatic increase in sales may be due to either a recent product improvementor an extensive marketing campaign, in which case proportionately moreprofit should be assigned to the developing or marketing affiliate, respectively. These conclusions are not intended to imply, however, that there must beyear-by-year equality between the related parties' incomes and the resultsof an ideal application of the method. The prior discussion of long-runversus year-by-year results is again relevant. For example, consider anindependent firm that uses only plant and equipment. Although it shouldearn the market rate of return in the long run, it will, in general, experiencelower returns or even losses in ``lean'' times and higher returns at theother end of the business cycle. Periodic adjustments will be requiredfor significant changes in income. Therefore, changes (either negativeor positive) that are less than significant may tend to even out in a long-termequilibrium. The absence of a requirement for an adjustment over time wheninsubstantial changes in income occur is a corollary of the rule that deminimis adjustments will not be made. Chapter 8 discusses this issue, includingreasons why explicit inter-year set-offs would not be practicable, in moredetail.  <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Priority and Coordination Among Methods  </ITAG>The previous sections of this chapter discussed two broad approaches foranalyzing transfers of intangible property: an approach based on comparabletransactions and one based on arm's length returns to factors employed.Which is to be used in a given situation? The answer is clear in one case.If an exact comparable is present, it and only it should be used to determinethe allocation of income from the transfer. It follows from the definitionof exactness that there can be no better evidence of what unrelated partiesoperating at arm's length would have done.  Finding an exact comparable, however, can be extremely difficult. In themajority of cases, particularly contested ones, the allocation of incomewill come from either the inexact comparable method or the arm's lengthreturn method. The facts and circumstances of each case should determinewhich method_or methods_should be used.  There are four basic types of cases. In the first, the intangible for whicha section 482 transfer price is being determined is comparable, to thoseused by unrelated taxpayers and each of the related parties is expectedto employ significant and complex intangibles. The inexact comparablesmethod should be chosen.  In the second case, the section 482 intangible is unique, and the affiliateutilizing the intangible will engage in functions that use only measurablefactors of production and routine amounts of intangibles. The basic arm'slength return method should be used.  In the third case, the section 482 intangible has many competitors andthe affiliate using the intangible will engage in simpler kinds of functions.<T3>Both</T3> of the methods are potentially applicable. Under the theoryon which they are based, they should yield similar results. This situationshould, in practice, be the easiest for the taxpayer to analyze and shouldengender the least amount of controversy.  In the final case, the section 482 intangible is unique and both of therelated parties own one or more significant intangibles that will be usedin exploiting it. This is the hardest case. The profit-split version ofthe arm's length return method must be used.  <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Risk-Bearing in Related Party Situations  </ITAG>Economic environments are full of uncertainty, and this fact must be recognizedin all methods of income allocation. In general, in a related party transaction,the market reward for taking risks must be allocated to the party trulyat risk.  Companies take risks in all dealings in the marketplace, and are rewardedfor doing so. Some of this risk disappears in related party transactions.The legislative history of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 noted: <ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, a parent corporation that transfers potentially valuableproperty to its subsidiary is not faced with the same risks as if it weredealing with an unrelated party. Its equity interest assures it of theability ultimately to obtain the benefit of future anticipated or unanticipatedprofits, without regard to the price it sets.\2\\1\\2\<NOTE/>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\2\ 1985 House Rep., <T3>supra</T3> n. 47, at 424 (1985). A line of court cases not directlyrelevant to section 482 has reached a similar conclusion. In <T3>Carnation</T3> and succeeding cases, members of an affiliated groupof corporations were denied deductions for ``insurance premium'' paymentsto another member of the group that insured predominantly risks of thegroup. The courts decided that no true insurance was present, because therewas no true risk shifting between the parent and its affiliates. <T3>Carnation Co.</T3> v. <T3>Comm'r</T3>, 71 T.C. 400 (1979), <T3>aff'd</T3>, 640 F.2d 410 (9th Cir. 1980), <T3>cert. denied</T3>, 454 U.S. 965 (1981). How should risk be accounted for in related party transactions? The riskinessof true economic activities gives rise to greater returns in the marketplace;therefore, if one part of an enterprise is inherently more risky than another,more income should be allocated to it. This allocation should be basedon the risks arising out of the true economic activities undertaken bythe parts of the enterprise, not on mechanisms that merely shift riskswithin the group.  This conclusion has implications for the proper application of both thecomparables approach and the arm's length return approach. First, in searchingfor appropriate comparables, one should look for situations in which anunrelated party contracted to perform an economic activity that is aboutequal in riskiness to the activity done by the affiliate; it would be inappropriateto rely on comparables in which the unrelated party undertook a significantrisk of some kind not undertaken by the related party. Likewise, in applyingthe arm's length rate of return method, unrelated party rates of returnshould be used only if they reflect similar levels of risk. But merelystating that unrelated party transactions must bear the same level of riskas the related party begs the question of what risks the related partyshould be allowed to assume. It's necessary to decide first what risksmay be appropriately assumed by the related parties, depending on the functionsthat each performs. Only then is it possible to identify what unrelatedparty arrangements are comparable so that comparable rates of return (orinexact comparable transactions) can be determined.  Returning to the Widgetco example, the affiliate, as the manufacturer,is at risk both with respect to its investment in plant and equipment andwith respect to inventories. The risk with respect to plant and equipmentwill be significant only if the facilities cannot be used for other purposeswithout incurring significant additional costs. If there is risk that theproduct will not be successful because there is uncertainty that the productwill perform as anticipated or have the usages anticipated, then that riskshould be borne by Widgetco as owner of the manufacturing intangible (thepatent) and should not be reflected in the affiliate's rate of return.The affiliate's return should reflect only the moderate level of risk borneby manufacturers of products that are reasonably expected to achieve marketacceptance. Likewise, if there is uncertainty that the product will bemarketed successfully, then that marketing risk also should not be borneby the affiliate but should probably be shared in some fashion by the ownerof the manufacturing intangible and the marketer, depending upon the extentto which anticipated profits from the enterprise are attributable to themanufacturing intangibles or the marketing activities.  On the other hand, assume that the risk does not relate to undue uncertaintyregarding the anticipated performance or usage of the product or the marketacceptability of the product. Assume, instead, that it is highly uncertainwhether the product can be produced cheaply enough to make the enterpriseviable, or that it is uncertain whether the manufacturing process willproduce the product with the same quality as prototypes produced in thelaboratory. These risks are risks inherent in the manufacturing functionand should probably be shared in some fashion between the owner of themanufacturing intangible and the manufacturing affiliate. If the manufacturingaffiliate is itself developing an efficient production process that attemptsto achieve low production costs or to assure consistency in quality ofoutput, then the affiliate should be allocated a return that reflects asubstantial portion of that risk being borne by the manufacturing affiliate.(In such case, the manufacturing affiliate would bring to bear significantmanufacturing process intangibles which would necessitate the applicationof the profit split addition to the basic arm's length return method.)If, instead, the owner of the intangible has also developed the productionprocess without significant contribution by the manufacturing affiliate,then a separate manufacturing intangible related to the production processhas been created, and the owner of such intangible is entitled to an arm'slength return. The manufacturing affiliate's return should not bear morethan the moderate level of risk borne by manufacturers of products thatare reasonably expected to achieve market acceptance.  <ITAG tagnum="81">F. Coordination With Other Aspects of Transfer Pricing  </ITAG>The purpose of this chapter is to provide a framework for the developmentof new methods for allocating income from intangible property. Therefore,methods for allocation of income in situations involving provision of services\2\\1\\3\<NOTE/> or transfers of tangible property \2\\1\\4\<NOTE/> may appear at first glance to be outside the scope of thepresent discussion. However, the rules for intangible property must becoordinated with the rules for other types of transactions between relatedparties for obvious reasons. Transfers of tangible property and provisionof services frequently accompany a transfer of intangible property; allthree are often bundled into a single economic transaction. Further, ifthe rules relating to one type of transaction become more or less favorableto taxpayers, then they will easily be able to find ways to structure theirtransactions to take advantage of the disparities.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\3\ Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.482-2(b).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\4\ Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.482-2(e).  It may be helpful to establish a priority for single economic transactionsthat involve more than one type of transfer. For example, licensing agreementsoften contain clauses that require the licensor to provide training orother services to the licensee. Further, transfers of tangible propertyoften involve intangibles, since the goods transferred often depend fortheir value on embodied trademarks or patents. In these cases, the basicallocation of income issue should be settled under the rules to be developedfor intangible property.  <ITAG tagnum="81">G. Conclusions and Recommendations </ITAG>1. An approach incorporating two alternative methods for determining transferprices for intangibles would achieve more appropriate allocations of incomeand greater consistency in result.2. The first method uses exact or inexact comparables when they exist.a. An exact comparable is the same intangible licensed to an unrelatedparties, when the circumstances surrounding it and the related party transferare similar. The price derived from this method has priority over all others.b. An inexact comparable is an intangible very similar to the intangibletransferred to a related party, but not identical. Differences must bedefinite and ascertainable. If the other intangible, the contractual arrangements,or the economic circumstances are too different, it may not be used asa comparable.3. The second method uses an arm's length return analysis instead of lookingfor a comparable transaction and adopting that transfer price as the section482 transfer price for the related party transfer.a. The basic arm's length return approach applies when one party to thetransaction performs economic functions using measurable assets or otherfactors, but not using significant intangibles of its own. The first stepis to break down the relevant line of business into its component activitiesor functions and measure the factors (generally assets) utilized by theparty performing the simpler set of functions. Income attributable to thosefunctions is determined by identifying rates of return to assets or otherfactors of unrelated entities performing similar economic activities andassuming similar economic risks, and applying a comparable rate of returnto the assets or other factors of the related party. Any residual incomeis thereby effectively assigned to the other party. The royalty rate orother transfer price for intangibles utilized by the related party mustbe set to achieve the allocation of residual income to the other party.b. When both parties perform complex economic functions, bear significanteconomic risks, and use significant self-developed intangibles, a profitsplit analysis must be added to the basic rate of return method. Underthe profit split analysis, the combined net income from the line of businessmust first be determined. The profit split analysis assigns the residualnet income, determined after applying the basic rate of return method tothe measurable assets of the parties, between the parties based upon therelative values of the parties' unique intangibles.4. While the standards for exact or inexact comparables do not requireyear-by-year equality between results of the unrelated party arrangementsand related party arrangements, unrelated party arrangements can lose theircomparability over time as the facts and circumstances relevant to thestandards for comparability change. In such case an adjustment to allocationsof income may be necessary. Under the arm's length return method, incomeallocations reflect the functions performed by the parties and_<T3>i.e.,</T3> they reflect the measurable factors of production and thevalue of significant intangibles employed by the parties in performingthose functions. Therefore, income allocated to the related parties underthe arm's length return method will change as the functions performed orthe factors of production or value of intangibles employed by the partieschange.5. Other than in the case of exact comparables, there should be no priorityamong these methods. However, each is designed to be utilized under a specificset of facts, so the underlying fact pattern should determine the methodor methods to be used.6. Risk should be accounted for under all methods described in this chapter,since the market rewards risk takers. However, the risk premium shouldbe attributed to the affiliate undertaking the economic function in whichthe risk inheres.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS</ITAG>Preceding parts of this study have analyzed the proper prices to be applied,or amount of income to be allocated, when an intangible is transferredbetween related parties. Cost sharing arrangements are an alternative methodby which related parties can develop and exploit intangibles. The historyof such arrangements, their acceptance for tax purposes, and an outlineof rules that should be followed for post-1986 cost sharing arrangementsare discussed in this part.<ITAG tagnum="84">Chapter 12</ITAG>History of Cost Sharing<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Introduction</ITAG>In general, a cost sharing arrangement is an agreement between two or morepersons to share the costs and risks of research and development as theyare incurred in exchange for a specified interest in any property thatis developed. Because each participant ``owns'' specified rights to anyintangibles developed under the arrangement, no royalties are paid by theparticipants for exploiting their rights to such intangibles. The ConferenceReport accompanying the 1986 Act indicates that Congress did not intendto preclude the use of bona fide research and development cost sharingarrangements. However, Congress expected the results produced under a bonafide cost sharing arrangement to be consistent with results under the commensuratewith income standard.\2\\1\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\5\ 1986 Conf. Rep., <T3>supra</T3> n. 2, at II-6.Cost sharing arrangements have long existed at arm's length between unrelatedparties. Typically, unrelated parties pool their resources and expertisein a joint effort to develop a specified product in exchange for a shareof potential profits. The Service has little experience with ordinary unrelatedparty cost sharing arrangements because they are at arm's length and normallydo not have unusual tax consequences.\2\\1\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\6\ <T3>See generally</T3> Rev.

Mem. 36,531 (December 29, 1975).In view of the limited information currently available on both relatedand unrelated cost sharing agreements, the Service and Treasury would appreciatereceiving information from taxpayers regarding their contractual arrangementsand experience with cost sharing.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. 1966 Proposed Section 482 Regulations</ITAG>Proposed Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.482-2(d)(4), published on August 2, 1966,provided extensive rules for cost sharing arrangements.\2\\1\\7\<NOTE/> The proposed regulations permitted any affiliate (other thanone in the trade or business of producing intangible property) to participatein the cost sharing arrangement, provided that the intangible propertywas intended for use in connection with the active conduct of the affiliate'sbusiness. The regulations specifically authorized cost sharing arrangementsfor single projects, but did not disqualify multiple projects or continuingarrangements. The sharing of costs and risks was required to be proportionalto the anticipated benefits to be received by each member from the arrangement.Cost sharing was required to be based on sales, profits or other variablecriteria.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\7\ 31 FR 10394 (1966).The 1966 proposed regulations did not explicitly address the ``buy-in''question_that is, the compensation to be paid to the developer or ownerof intangibles that are made available at the time the arrangement commences.They did, however, require that an arm's length amount be paid to the affiliatethat provides intangibles that substantially contribute to the arrangement.Any required section 482 allocation for services provided by other affiliateswas also to be included as a cost of the arrangement.The proposed cost sharing regulations were ultimately abandoned in favorof the simpler general requirements presently contained in andSection; 1.482-2(d)(4).<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Current Regulations</ITAG>The current rules in andSection; 1.482-2(d)(4) state that a cost sharingagreement must be in writing and provide for the sharing of costs and risksof developing intangible property in return for a specified interest inthe property that may be produced. A bona fide cost sharing arrangementmust reflect an effort in good faith by the participants to bear theirrespective shares of all costs and risks on an arm's length basis. Theterms and conditions must be comparable to those that would have been adoptedby unrelated parties in similar circumstances.\2\\1\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\8\ Whether a particular cost sharing agreement meetsthe requirements of section 482 is generally a factual question not appropriatefor a private letter ruling.

Foreign Experience With Cost Sharing Agreements</ITAG>The 1979 OECD Report on <T3>Transfer Pricing and Multinational Enterprises</T3> \219\<NOTE/> stated that, although international cost sharing agreementsfor research and development costs were not common, some had recently beenentered into by large multinational enterprises. The OECD report indicatedthat, with the exception of the United States, none of its members hadlaws or regulations pertaining specifically to cost sharing arrangements.A major concern expressed by the OECD report was that the participantsto the arrangement be in a position to benefit from any intangibles developedunder the arrangement before the cost sharing payments would be allowedas deductible expenses. The OECD report stated that the United States didnot require a profit mark-up for research and development activities performed.The OECD report reflected a consensus, however, that a profit mark-up wouldbe appropriate when research was performed at the specific request of amember of the cost sharing group.

Deficit Reduction Act of 1984</ITAG>Section 367(d), enacted in 1984, provides that a transfer of intangiblesto foreign corporations in an exchange described in section 351 or 361is to be treated as a sale, with the transferor being treated as receivingamounts that reasonably reflect the amounts that would have been receivedunder an agreement providing for annual payments contingent on productivity,use, or disposition of the property. Such payments are treated as reductionsof the foreign entity's earnings and profits and as U.S. source incometo the U.S. receipient. The ``Blue Book'' discussion of section 367(d)indicates that it is to have no application to bona fide cost sharing arrangements.\2\\2\\1\<NOTE/> The Blue Book further recognized that it may be appropriatefor the Treasury Department to elaborate on the current cost sharing rulesto address problems with cost sharing arrangements.\2\\2\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\\1\ <T3>General Explanation of the DRA of 1984, supra</T3> n. 143, at 433.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\\2\ <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">F. Cost Sharing Under Section 936(h)</ITAG>After 1982, the intangible income of a domestic corporation qualifyingfor the possessions tax credit must be included in the income of its U.S.shareholders, unless the possessions corporation either elects the costsharing method or elects the 50% of combined taxable income method, bothof which are contained in section 936(h). Under the section 936(h) costsharing election, the possessions must pay its share of the affiliatedgroup's total research and development costs based on the ratio of salesby the affiliated group of products produced in the possession to totalsales by the affiliated group of all products. The cost sharing paymentmust be computed with respect to ``product areas'' rather than single projects.``Product areas'' are defined, in general, by reference to the three-digitStandard Industrial Classification codes (SIC codes) promulgated by theCommerce Department. Cost sharing payments made by the possessions corporationare not treated as income to the recipient but reduce otherwise allowableexpenses.A possessions corporation making the cost sharing election is treated asowning the manufacturing intangibles utilized in its business, and theincome from such intangibles then becomes eligible for the possessionstax credit. Pricing of products between a possessions corporation electingthe cost sharing method and its domestic U.S. affiliates must still meetthe requirements of section 482, taking into account that the possessionscorporation is treated as owning the manufacturing intangibles.Pursuant to an amendment made by the 1986 Act, a possession corporationmaking the cost sharing election must pay the greater of 110% of the pre-1986statutory cost sharing amount or the royalty required to be paid to thedeveloper of the intangibles under the commensurate with income standard.\2\\2\\3\<NOTE/> Given the special circumstances in which the section 936(h)cost sharing provisions apply and the 1986 Act changes, section 936(h)cost sharing arrangements do not provide much guidance with regard to theappropriate requirements for other cost sharing arrangements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\\3\ Section 936(h)(5)(C)(i)(I), as amended by andSection;1231(a)(1)(A), Pub.

It should be made clear at the outset that, ifan arrangement is not bona fide, any payments made under the cost sharingagreement will be considered as offsets to the arm's length price thatshould have been paid for the intangibles. While andSection; 1.482-2(d)(4)limits adjustments by the Service in the context of cost sharing arrangementsto an adjustment of contributions paid, this regulation presupposes thatthe arrangement is bona fide. If the arrangement is not bona fide, normalarm's length standards would apply, including the commensurate with incomestandard.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Products Covered</ITAG>In section 936(h), product area research is defined generally by referenceto the three-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes, meaningthat the section 936(h) cost sharing arrangement covers research and developmentcosts over a very broad product area.\2\\2\\8\<NOTE/> As described above, the legislative history to the 1986 Actcontemplates that a section 482 cost sharing arrangement should cover allresearch and development costs within an ``appropriate product area.''The approach in section 936 and in the 1986 Act legislative history contraststo the proposed 1966 regulations. Cost sharing arrangements described inthe 1966 proposed regulations could cover a single project, although multi-projector product area cost sharing agreements were not prohibited.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\\8\ Section 936(h)(5)(C)(i)(I).As discussed in section C below, broad product area cost sharing arrangementsraise the issue of whether the potential benefits are proportionate tothe participants' cost sharing payments. This issue is of particular concernin cost sharing arrangements of foreign-owned multinational groups if U.S.persons are participants, since cost sharing payments made by U.S. participantsare deductible for U.S. tax purposes.\2\\2\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\\9\ Another potential abuse may arise in the contextof a domestic affiliate that is a co-developer of the intangible, or otherwiseparticipates in a <T3>de facto</T3> cost sharing arrangement. In such cases, the foreignentity may try to avoid the characterization of a cost sharing arrangementin order to extract royalties from the domestic affiliate, particularlywhere the withholding tax on the royalties is reduced by a tax treaty andthe royalty income is not taxed or lightly taxed by the foreign jurisdiction.On the other hand, single product arrangements present the potential thatcost sharing may be employed solely for high profit potential intangibles,such that foreign affiliates of U.S. multinational groups acquire the rightsto such intangibles without bearing the cost of research related to lowprofit potential intangibles and unsuccessful research. The incentive toinclude selectively only high profit potential intangibles in a cost sharingarrangement is most acute when tax haven entities are the primary or predominateparticipants in the arrangement.\2\\3\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\\0\ <T3>See Lilly, supra</T3>, n. 57, at 1150.Three-digit SIC code product areas would seem to be the appropriate scopeof most cost sharing arrangements. Both the Service or the taxpayer shouldbe permitted to demonstrate, however, that a narrower or broader agreementis more appropriate. Taxpayers choosing a narrower agreement would needto show that the agreement is not merely an attempt to shift profits fromsuccessful research areas while leaving expenses of unsuccessful or lesssuccessful areas to be absorbed by the U.S. or higher tax affiliates. Forexample, some members of a multinational food and beverage group mightbe interested in research and development to develop a multipurpose artificialsweetener, yet their respective food and beverage product lines might besufficiently diverse (or might be products for which research and developmentis not necessary) that a single product agreement would be appropriate.Taxpayers choosing a broader agreement would need to show that the agreementis not being used to charge U.S. affiliates or other participants for researchand development without reasonable prospect of benefit. From the Service'sperspective, a product area that is broader or narrower than three-digitSIC codes may be necessary to avoid these distortions.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Cost Shares and Benefits</ITAG>Underlying all of the problems discussed in the legislative history ofthe 1986 Act in relation to cost sharing arrangements is the fundamentalprinciple that the costs borne by each of the participants should be proportionateto the reasonably anticipated benefits to be received over time by eachparticipant from exploiting intangibles developed under the cost sharingarrangement. This cost share/benefit principle has several facets, includingthe appropriate product area to be covered (discussed in section B above),definition of costs to be covered (discussed in section D below), and themeasurement of anticipated benefits and several other issues discussedbelow.1. <T3>Assignment of exclusive geographic rights. </T3>In general, the computationof cost shares should reflect a good faith effort to measure reasonablyanticipated benefits to be derived from the arrangement. While it is difficultunder the best of circumstances to predict what benefits each of the participantswill derive, it is virtually impossible to do so unless the participantsare assigned specific exclusive geographic rights to intangibles developedunder the arrangement. Specific assignment of rights could take the formof assigning the rights to manufacturing intangibles relating to productsto be sold in the United States to a U.S. affiliate, rights related toEuropean markets to an Irish affiliate, rights related to Middle Easternand Pacific rim markets to a Singapore affiliate, etc. In such case, theU.S. affiliate would derive the income attributable to the manufacturingintangibles developed under the arrangement with respect to any sales inU.S. markets regardless of whether ultimately the U.S. affiliate is manufacturingthe products sold in U.S. markets. (As discussed below, however, the participantsmust be those expected to exploit the intangibles by performing the manufacturingfunction themselves.)Alternatively, exclusive worldwide rights to different types of intangiblesdeveloped under the arrangement could be assigned to particular participants.This latter type of arrangement would warrant special scrutiny to assurethat the cost shares reflect reasonably anticipated benefits.\2\\3\\1\<NOTE/> Moreover, if research activities are not common to the varioustypes of intangibles produced under the arrangement, then the researchrelated to each type of intangible should be charged to the specific affiliatethat will receive the rights to that type of intangible. This is particularlytrue of arrangements where one of the parties produces components. TheService and Treasury would welcome comments on this topic. In short, suchresearch activities are not the proper subject of a cost sharing arrangement.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\\1\ As discussed in the next paragraph, rights to exploitan intangible in the U.S. must belong to a U.S. affiliate.For various reasons, including consistency with longstanding section 367(a)policy, U.S. geographic rights should never be permitted to be assignedunder a cost sharing arrangement to a foreign person if either: (1) Theparticipants are part of a U.S. owned multinational group; (2) a significantportion of the research is performed in the United States; or (3) any U.S.person participates in the arrangement. Accordingly, U.S. rights couldbe acquired by a foreign person only in the case of a foreign-owned multinationalgroup that conducts the research overseas and does not include any U.S.affiliates as a participant in the arrangement.2. <T3>Overly broad agreements. </T3>The principle that cost shares be proportionateover time to the reasonably anticipated benefits may affect the issue ofwhether cost sharing arrangements are overly broad in terms of the productscovered or the affiliates participating in the agreement. For instance,a manufacturing conglomerate makes widgets and gadgets. An overall costsharing agreement for research and development may be inappropriate ifa particular affiliate does not make both widgets and gadgets. If a disproportionateamount of research and development relates to widgets but affiliate A manufacturesonly gadgets, affiliate A would be subsidizing the research for the widgetmanufacturers. Although every participant in a cost sharing agreement shouldnot be required to benefit from every intangible that may be produced,cost shares should be proportionate to the reasonably anticipated benefits.It may be necessary, therefore, either to have separate cost sharing agreementsfor widget and gadget research, to adjust affiliate A's cost share to reflectthe costs related to gadget research, or to exclude affiliate A from thecost sharing arrangement.\2\\3\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\\2\ The exclusion of affiliate A from the cost sharingarrangement raises the question of which of the other participants shouldpay for research related to intangibles that may be used by affiliate A.For various reasons, not all affiliates that anticipate using the intangiblesdeveloped under the cost sharing agreement may actually participate inthe arrangement. For example, there may be reason to exclude a particularaffiliate that manufactures only certain types of products and thereforewill use only certain types of intangibles developed under the arrangement.Alternatively, the arrangement may not be recognized under foreign lawfor tax purposes, such that a deduction for cost sharing payments wouldbe denied. In such cases, some affiliate must fund research for intangiblerights to be used in manufacturing by the nonparticipants. While thereis no clear answer, it seems appropriate that the affiliate that performsthe research should fund and receive the residual rights.3. <T3>Direct exploitation of intangibles by participants. </T3>The cost share/benefitprinciple may otherwise affect who may participate in a cost sharing arrangement.In general, the benefit to be derived under a cost sharing arrangementis the right to use a developed intangible in the manufacture of a product.Therefore, the participant must be in a position to exploit the intangiblein the manufacture of products.\2\\3\\3\<NOTE/> It is not necessary that all participants be capable of manufactureat the time costs are being incurred, so long as it is reasonably anticipatedthat the participants will be capable of manufacture once the intangiblesare developed and will use intangibles developed under the arrangementin the manufacture of products.\2\\3\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\\3\ As a roughly analogous requirement, the 1966 regulationsrequired that participants use the intangibles developed under the costsharing arrangement in the active conduct of their trade or business. Prop.Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.482-2(d)(4)(ii)(b), 31 FR 10,394 (1966). The 1966regulations would also have excluded as participants companies in the tradeor business of performing research for others. This latter exclusion seemsunnecessary so long as the affiliate that performs the research and developmentfunds an appropriate portion of the research and development costs andis capable of using the intangible rights that it acquires under the agreementin the manufacture of products.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\\4\ Expectations will not always prove true, and insome situations the participant that acquires certain rights to intangiblesdeveloped under the cost sharing agreement will not ultimately directlyexploit those rights. For example, assume that a Dutch affiliate acquiresthe European rights to intangibles developed under the arrangement withthe anticipation of manufacturing products for European markets in Ireland.It later appears that it will be necessary for various reasons to havea locally incorporated entity manufacture in Germany products to be soldin the German market. Unless the German rights to the intangible are transferredin a contribution to capital or other tax free transaction, the Germanrights would have to be licensed or sold to the German affiliate. In eithercase the intangible would be subject to section 482 and, generally, thesubpart F provisions would treat the resulting royalty or sales incomeas foreign personal holding company income includible in subpart F income.4. <T3>Measurement of anticipated benefits. </T3>In order to determine whethercost shares are proportionate to reasonably anticipated benefits, it isnecessary to measure the anticipated benefits. Obviously there has to besome prediction, rough though it may be, of the kinds of intangibles likelyto be produced and the relative proportion of units that will be producedand sold under the rights of each participant. In many cases, estimatedunits of production may be an appropriate measure of benefit assuming thatthere is a uniform unit of production that can be used as a measuring device.If there is no uniform unit of production, then sales value may be an appropriatemeasure, if measured at the same level of production or distribution forall participants. As stated in section A above, however, the ConferenceReport anticipated that cost shares be proportionate to profit as determinedbefore research and development. Given the legislative history, therefore,neither units of production nor sales would be an appropriate measure ifit were apparent (or became apparent during the course of the agreement)that profitability differed substantially with respect to various participants'rights. This would be true, for example, in situations in which geographicmarkets differ significantly in terms of production costs, market barriers,or other factors that bear significantly on profitability. In such cases,estimated gross profit or net profit may have to be used, or some adjustmentsmay have to be made to cost shares determined on the basis of units ofproduction or sales.It is not realistic, however, to expect taxpayers in most instances tobe able to estimate gross or net profit margins from estimated sales. Evenestimates of units produced or sales value probably would be imprecise.It may be that a cost sharing agreement should not be recognized if unitsof production or sales are not appropriate measures and gross or net marginsare extremely difficult to estimate. In such cases, the relationship betweencost shares and anticipated benefits may simply be too tenuous.5. <T3>Periodic adjustments. </T3>The language in the legislative historythat the results of cost sharing arrangements be consistent with changesmade by the 1986 Act to royalty arrangements has one other obvious implication.The cost shares should be adjusted periodically, on a prospective basis,to reflect changes in the estimates of relative benefits, including a changein the measurement standard if that becomes appropriate. In any event thereis always a risk that the cost sharing agreement could subsequently berejected as a bona fide arrangement if the estimates of benefits derivedunder the arrangement proved to be so substantially disproportionate tothe cost shares that the estimates of benefits cannot be considered tohave been made in good faith. Periodic adjustments to the cost sharingarrangement would reduce that risk.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Costs To Be Shared</ITAG>In general, the costs to be shared should include all direct and indirectcosts of the research and development undertaken as part of the arrangement.Direct costs would include expenses for salaries, research materials, andfacilities. However, there should be a limitation on the annual inclusionof costs for depreciable assets that is consistent with U.S. tax accountingprinciples. Otherwise, deductions for outbound payments may be overstated.Indirect costs should include a portion of overall corporate managementexpense and overall interest expense that is allocated and apportionedto research and development activities in a manner consistent with U.S.expense allocation principles. The costs to be reimbursed should be netof any charges for research undertaken on specific request or for any governmentsubsidies granted.\2\\3\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\235\ It is generally expected that there will not be a profitelement in cost sharing agreements. A profit should be required, however,for research performed at the specific request of a group member or fora person outside the arrangement group. OECD, <T3>Transfer Pricing and Multinational Enterprises, supra </T3>n. 158,at p. 119. In either case, the amount received should reduce the coststo be shared. One item that should not be included in the costs to be sharedamong the participants is the buy-in cost of transferring intangibles fromthe party by whom they were developed to the other participants. This generalsubject is discussed in section E below.<ITAG tagnum="81">E. Buy-in Requirements</ITAG>As previously stated, the legislative history to the 1986 Act states thata party to a cost sharing arrangement that has contributed funds or incurredrisks for development of intangibles at an earlier stage must be appropriatelycompensated by the other participants_hence the requirement for a buy-inpayment. One of the primary reasons for adopting cost sharing provisionsis to avoid the necessity of valuing intangibles. Yet, if there are intangiblesthat are not fully developed that relate to the research to be conductedunder the cost sharing arrangement, it is necessary to value them in orderto determine an appropriate buy-in payment.There are three basic types of intangibles subject to the buy-in requirement.A participant may own preexisting intangibles at various stages of developmentthat will become subject to the arrangement. A company may also conductbasic research not associated with any product. Finally, there may be agoing concern value associated with a participant's research facilitiesand capabilities that will be utilized.Fully developed intangibles command a royalty to the extent used by otherparticipants and are generally not appropriately incorporated into a costsharing arrangement. Thus, royalties for preexisting developed intangiblesmay not be included in the buy-in payment, but instead are subject to thegeneral rules of the commensurate with income standard. Because a subsequentsubstantial deviation in the income stream from the intangible might requirean adjustment, it is important to identify separately the income streamand royalties related to preexisting developed intangibles. In many situations,research is performed with respect to preexisting intangibles in orderto improve the preexisting intangibles (improved software, for example)or to develop the next generation of intangibles. The requirement for anadjustment to the royalty paid for the intangible would not apply if theintangible is enhanced in value solely as a result of research undertakenafter inception of the cost sharing arrangement.The buy-in payment should reflect the full fair market value of all intangiblesutilized in the arrangement and not merely costs incurred to date. To permita buy-in based on cost would be inconsistent with the provisions of section367(d) which effectively precluded the tax-free transfer of intangiblesand, by implication, the transfer of intangibles at cost.\2\\3\\6\<NOTE/> The buy-in payment could take the form of lump sum or periodicpayments spread over the average life expectancy of contributed intangibles_perhapson a declining basis since intangibles generally have greater value inthe earlier stages of their life cycle. Obviously, periodic payments shouldreflect the time value benefit of not making a lump sum payment at theinception of the agreement.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\\6\ The legislative history of the 1984 Act states thatthe provisions of section 367(d) can be avoided by selling intangiblessubject to the application of section 482 to the sale. S. Rep. No. 169,98th Cong., 2nd Sess., vol. 1 at 368 (1984). The legislative history didnot contemplate that a transfer at cost would avoid the application ofsection 367(d).A ``buy-out'' occurs when a participant withdraws from a cost sharing arrangement.Having funded a portion of research and development prior to withdrawal,that person owns a share of whatever the agreement has borne to date andmust be compensated by the other participants for the value of what thearrangement has produced to date and not merely reimbursed for costs incurredto date.A ``secondary buy-in'' is required when new members are admitted aftera cost sharing agreement is in place. If a new member is acquiring a portionof the geographic rights of one of the original participants, any buy-inamount should be paid to the affiliate whose geographic rights are beingreduced. Once again, in order for the buy-in to be arm's length, any newmember must compensate the original participants in a manner similar tothe original buy-in computation, but based upon current values and notmerely costs incurred to date.<ITAG tagnum="81">F. Marketing Intangibles </ITAG>The 1986 amendment to section 482 provides that the term ``intangible property''shall have the same meaning as in section 936(h)(3)(B). The section 936definition of intangible property includes marketing intangibles. Thisdoes not mean, however, that marketing intangibles are necessarily theproper subject of cost sharing rules developed with manufacturing intangiblesin mind. In general, marketing costs yield a present benefit (even if also a futurebenefit) and, therefore, are currently deductible expenses for which acharge must be made under the services provisions of the section 482 regulationsif the benefit therefrom accrues to a related person.\237\<NOTE/> (Research expenses related to manufacturing intangibles generallydo not yield present benefits but, nevertheless, are currently deductiblepursuant to the special provisions of section 174.) In the context of marketingexpenses, the services regulations under section 482 presently serve thesame function as would rules governing cost sharing arrangements in identifyingthe potential beneficiaries of a marketing expense and requiring an appropriatecharge (albeit with a profit element in certain cases). There seems tobe no need for an additional regime to deal with the tax treatment of costsharing arrangements related to marketing expenses. Comment is requested,however, concerning any situations which are believed not to be coveredby the section 482 services regulations or any perceived problems whicharise under those regulations as they affect marketing expenses. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\237\ Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.482-2(b)(2). <ITAG tagnum="81">G. Character of Cost Sharing Payments </ITAG>Under section 936(h), the amount of any required cost sharing payment isnot treated as income of the recipient, but instead reduces the amountof deductions otherwise allowable.\238\<NOTE/> More generally, when expenditures are made with the expectationof reimbursement, they are treated as loans, and therefore the reimbursementdoes not constitute gross income to the recipient.\239\<NOTE/> Accordingly, cost sharing payments are not income to therecipient but, instead, reduce costs which are otherwise deductible incomputing taxable income and earnings and profits. Since cost sharing paymentsare not gross income to the recipient, no U.S. withholding tax would beimposed on outbound cost sharing payments made by a U.S. person to a foreignperson. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\238\ Section 936(h)(5)(C)(i)(IV)(a); Treas.

Characterizing cost sharing payments in this manner also reduces the amountof research and development expenses of the entity performing the researchthat are subject to allocation under the rules of andSection; 1.861-8 andincreases the amount subject to allocation by the participants making thecost sharing payments.\240\<NOTE/> Furthermore, since the payments received by the entity performingthe research will not constitute income, payments received by a U.S. entityfrom foreign affiliates are not foreign source income to the U.S. entity.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\240\ Section 1.861-8 sets out rules for allocating and apportioningdeductions between U.S. and foreign source gross income. A special allocationrule gives companies the right to allocate fewer U.S. research and developmentexpenses to foreign source income, even though the income generated bythe expenses is foreign source. Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.861-8(e)(3)(B)(ii).Under the 1986 Act, 50 percent of all amounts allowable as a deductionfor qualified domestic research and experimental expenditures is apportionedto income from sources within the United States, with only the remaining50 percent apportioned on the basis of gross sales or gross income of companiesbenefitting from the research and development. This special provision appliesonly to expenses incurred in tax years after August 1, 1986, and on orbefore August 1, 1987. andSection; 1216, Pub. L. 99-514, 100 Stat. 2085 (1986).Provisions similar in concept are currently under consideration in Congress.For purposes of calculating the credit allowable under section 41 for researchexpenditures, members of a commonly controlled group of corporations maydisregard intercompany reimbursements for research expenditures.\241\<NOTE/> This rule treats a U.S. company that actually performs U.S.situs research as incurring 100 percent of the research expenses for purposesof calculating the research credit, even if the U.S. company is reimbursedfor a portion of those expenses pursuant to a section 482 cost sharingarrangement. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\241\ Tres. Reg. andSection; 1.44F-6(e); Priv. Ltr. Rul. 8643006(July 23, 1986).One group of taxpayers has suggested that the regulations should allowa cost sharer to denominate its rights under a cost sharing arrangementas a geographically exclusive, no-royalty, perpetual license if a licenseis required to obtain local country tax benefits or if the parent wouldbe in a better position to protect against infringement than the subsidiary.If under U.S. law, the participant is clearly the beneficial owner of intangiblesdeveloped under the cost sharing arrangement, then labeling its interestas a ``license'' will not change the characterization for U.S. tax purposes,even if legal title to the rights are held by its parent serving as nomineeowners of such rights. Therefore, whatever label is applied to the arrangementfor foreign law purposes generally would not affect its U.S. tax treatmentunless the label affects substantive legal rights relating to the intangible.<ITAG tagnum="81">H. Possessions Corporations </ITAG>The cost sharing payment made by a possessions corporation pursuant tothe special cost sharing election under section 936(h)(5)(I) must be determinedunder those rules and not under a contractual cost sharing arrangementthat would otherwise govern the charges incurred by the participants. Indeed,the statute and regulations explicitly provide that the section 936(h)cost sharing payment shall not be reduced by a contractual cost sharingpayment.\242\<NOTE/> Under section 936(h), the cost sharing payment by the possessionscorporation must equal the greater of the amount required under the newcommensurate with income standard or 110 percent of the pre-1986 Act statutorycost sharing amount. Under the commensurate with income standard, the costsharing amount must at least equal the fair market royalty which wouldhave to be paid to the developer if the manufacturing intangibles had beenlicensed (even in cases in which the intangible had previously been transferredin a section 351 exchange). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\242\ Section 936(h)(5)(c)(i)(I); Treas. Reg. andSection; 1.936-6(a)(3).The amount paid under section 936(h) entitles the possessions corporationto be treated as the owner of manufacturing intangibles previously developedby its U.S. affiliates. The fact that a possessions corporation has enteredinto a cost sharing arrangement for the development of future intangiblesand is paying a lesser amount under that arrangement does not affect theamount required under the section 936(h) cost sharing election. Indeed,since the section 936(h) cost sharing payment is compensation for intangiblespreviously developed and the section 482 cost sharing payment made pursuantto the contractual cost sharing agreement is for the cost of developingnew intangibles, both amounts appropriately must be paid initially_oneby statutory election and the second pursuant to the contractual arrangement.It might be argued that, once intangibles are developed under the section482 cost sharing arrangement, the possessions corporation's section 936cost sharing payment should be reduced so that the possessions corporationdoes not pay a second time for that intangible. The statute, however, precludesthat result. <ITAG tagnum="81">I. Administrative Requirements </ITAG>Taxpayers seeking to enter into cost sharing arrangements should be requiredto make a formal election and to document the specifics of the agreementcontemporaneously. Any U.S. participant should be required to include acopy of the agreement with its first return filed subsequent to the agreement'seffective date. Taxpayers making the election would agree to produce, inEnglish and in the United States, the records of foreign participants necessaryto verify the computation and appropriateness of the respective cost shareswithin 60 days of a request by the Service. These records would includeidentification of the SIC code or other basis used to determine productscovered by the agreement, and summary information concerning sales, grossmargins, and net income derived with respect to such products. The HouseReport accompanying the 1986 Act suggests that the Service should requiresimilar records to be kept and produced under the authority of section6001 for section 936(h) cost sharing agreements.\2\\4\\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\\3\1985 House Rep., <T3>supra </T3>n. 47, at 418-419.<ITAG tagnum="81">J. Transitional Issues for Existing Cost Sharing Agreements</ITAG>It is unlikely that there will be preexisting cost sharing agreements thatwill meet all of the standards described above. If such agreements arenot recognized, the Service and taxpayers will encounter significant problemsin determining ownership of preexisting intangibles and the treatment ofthe payments that have been made pursuant to the preexisting agreements.Some type of grandfather treatment would therefore appear to be appropriate.One possibility would be to permit any cost sharing agreement that conformsto the requirements of the existing regulations, and that has been in existencefor more than 5 years prior to 1987, to be recognized fully if conformedwithin a certain period after the promulgation of the new rules with respectto matters other than the buy-ins that occurred prior to June 6, 1984 (theeffective date of section 367(d)). If the cost sharing agreement has beenin effect for less than 5 years and the agreement does not conform substantiallyto the new rules, then the old agreement would not be recognized. If anew agreement that conforms to the new rules is adopted, then all paymentspursuant to the old agreement would be taken into account as an adjustmentto any required buy-in payments relating to the new agreement.\2\\4\\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\\4\This approach is generally consistent with the costsharing regulations published in 1968, which permitted pre-existing costsharing agreements to be modified within 90 days of publication of thesection 482 regulations. Treas. Reg. andSection;1.482-2(d)(4). <ITAG tagnum="81">K. Conclusions and Recommendations </ITAG>1. Congress intended to permit cost sharing arrangements if they produceresults consistent with the commensurate with income standard in section482. 2. Three-digit SIC code product areas seem to be the appropriate scopefor most cost sharing arrangements. Both the Service and the taxpayer shouldbe permitted to demonstrate, however, that a narrower or broader agreementis more appropriate. 3. The fundamental principle underlying the concerns identified in thelegislative history of the 1986 Act with respect to cost sharing is thatcosts borne by each of the participants must be proportionate to the reasonablyanticipated benefits to be received over time by the participants fromexploiting intangibles developed under a cost sharing arrangement. Thisprinciple has several implications.a. In order for taxpayers to make a good faith effort to predict anticipatedbenefits, it is essential that the participants be assigned specific andexclusive geographic rights to intangibles developed under the arrangement.U.S. geographic rights generally should not be permitted to be assignedto a foreign person.b. Cost sharing arrangements may be overly broad in terms of products coveredor affiliates participating in the agreement if some participants wouldutilize only a narrow range of intangibles developed under the agreement.c. Since the benefit to be derived under a cost sharing arrangement isthe right to use developed intangibles in the manufacture of a product,participants must generally be capable of manufacturing and using developedintangibles in the manufacture of products.d. In estimating anticipated benefits, units of production or sales valuegenerally would be an acceptable unit of measure unless profitability wouldreasonably be expected to differ significantly with respect to variousparticipants' rights. In the latter instance, some adjustments must bemade, or some other standard of measurement utilized, to reflect more accuratelythe reasonably anticipated benefits to be derived by the participants.e. Cost shares should be adjusted periodically, on a prospective basis,to reflect changes in the estimates of relative benefits, including a changein the measurement standard if that becomes necessary.4. The costs to be shared should include all direct and indirect costsdetermined in a manner consistent with U.S. tax accounting and expenseallocation principles.5. A party that contributes funds or incurs risks for development of intangiblesat an earlier stage must be appropriately compensated by the other participantsin the form of a buy-in for the value of preexisting intangibles (includingbasic research and the going concern value of research capability).a. Fully developed intangible command a royalty and should not be incorporatedinto a cost sharing agreement, with the result that the buy-in may notreflect compensation for fully developed intangibles.b. A secondary buy-in is required whenever a participant withdraws froma cost sharing arrangement or a new participant enters the arrangement.6. Expenses relating to marketing intangibles are presently governed bythe services provisions of the section 482 regulations. There seems tobe no need for marketing expenses to be subject to a cost sharing regimedeveloped for manufacturing intangibles.7. Cost sharing payments are not income to the recipient but, instead,reduce costs that are otherwise deductible for purposes of computing taxableincome and earnings and profits. Consequently, outbound cost sharing paymentsare not subject to U.S. withholding tax, and inbound payments are not foreignsource income.8. Since a section 936(h) cost sharing payment is compensation for intangiblespreviously developed and a section 482 cost sharing payment is for thecost of developing new intangibles, both amounts appropriately must bepaid initially if a possessions corporation making the section 936(h) costsharing election enters into a section 482 cost sharing arrangement. Underthe statute, the section 936(h) payment may in no event be reduced to reflectamounts paid under a section 482 cost sharing agreement.9. Taxpayers should be required to make a formal election if they enterinto a cost sharing arrangement, to file a copy of the agreement with theirreturn, and produce records necessary to verify the computation and appropriatenessof the respective cost shares.10. Cost sharing agreements in existence for more than five years priorto 1987 should be grandfathered if they conform in certain respects withnew rules to be promulgated. Other agreements will not be bona fide unlessand until they substantially conform to the new rules.<ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix A_Analysis of Questionnaire Responses</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">A. </ITAG><T3>IRS Access To Pricing Information</T3><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Significant section 482 issues were identified by IEs over70 percent of the time and by the domestic agent about 10 percent of thetime.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Significant section 482 issues were initially identifiedusing the following sources:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p6,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s20,8</C> <H1> </H1><H1/><T3>Percentage of responses</T3>Source:<ITAG tagnum="2">Form 5471<D>50.36</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Form 5472<D>23.74</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Financial data<D>13.67</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Prior exam<D>7.19</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Industry experience<D>2.88</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Customs data<D>2.16</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Time alloted to develop the 482 issue was determined by:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p6,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s20,8</C> <H1> </H1><H1/><T3>Percentage of responses</T3><ITAG tagnum="1">Case manager<D>51.32</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Domestic group manager<D>7.78</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">I.E. manager<D>35.53</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Branch chief<D>5.26</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; About 66 percent of the IEs reported that the decision ontime allotment was made after receiving adequate opportunity to analyzethe section 482 issue.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Almost 90 percent of respondents stated the time allotedto examine the section 482 issue was flexible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Factors affecting time allotment were:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p6,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s20,8</C> <H1> </H1><H1/><T3>Percentage of responses</T3><ITAG tagnum="1">Potential yield<D>32.84</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Assurance of yield<D>4.48</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Both of the above<D>28.35</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Neither of the above<D>34.33</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Annual Reports to shareholders were used to identify or developsection 482 issues in 34 percent of the cases.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; The portions of the Annual Report specifically consideredfor identification or development of section 482 issues were:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p6,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s20,8</C> <H1> </H1><H1/><T3>Percentage of responses</T3><ITAG tagnum="1">Income tax notes<D>19</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Segment information note for product line<D>31</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Segment information for geographic area<D>36</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Other<D>14</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Sixty-five percent of respondents thought that informationon Forms 5471 and 5472 was helpful in planning exams.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; In 29 percent of the reported cases, section 482 issues wereidentified and not pursued.

Additionally, the Congressional concernabout related party use of inappropriate comparables raises questions aboutwhich characteristics of unrelated party arrangements should be includedin related party arrangements. This appendix draws upon academic work thatexamines actual licensing experience by unrelated parties in an effortto address this issue.\1\<NOTE/> Although each of the papers examined had a different goal,the underlying data collected through surveys or interviews with licenseesand licensors provides relevant information about what unrelated partiesdo.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Authors who rely on statistics that include related partytransactions are quick to point out that the numbers are biased due topotentially tax motivated manipulations. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Katz and Shapiro, <T3>How to License Intangible Property, </T3>101 Quarterly Journal of Economics567-589 (1986).<ITAG tagnum="21">In addition to synthesizing other authors' work on technology transfers,the Service and Treasury have collected a sample of license agreementsdrawn from the records of the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').The SEC requires that companies disclose license agreements that are ``material''to the operation of the company.\2\<NOTE/> The disclosures to the SEC provide a potential data baseof over five hundred agreements. Only sixty of these agreements have beenanalyzed for this report. The choice of agreements in the sample was largelydictated by the ease of discovery and the availability of documents withinthe SEC's files. The sample consists of forty agreements for the manufacturingindustry, most of which are clustered in the Standard Industrial Classifications(SIC) for pharmaceutical preparations, toilet preparations, electroniccomputing equipment, semiconductors, surgical and medical equipment, andophthalmic goods. The other twenty agreements are for the services industry,mostly within the SICs for computer programming, computer software, andresearch and development laboratories.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ ``Material'' is an accounting concept that describes itemsabout which a prudent investor ought reasonably to be informed.

Further examinationof the SEC agreements will be conducted after publication of this study,with a view toward relating them to financial accounting and tax data ofthe firms involved, and publishing the results.

Goal of Licensing Agreements</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Parties contemplating entering into a license agreement are ultimatelyconcerned with the income they can expect to receive from the arrangement.The existence of proprietary knowledge suggests that production and saleof the product will result in profits that are greater than those necessaryto provide a normal rate of return to the inputs provided by both parties.The actual division of these profits will depend on each party's forecastof the total profits, and on the relative bargaining strength of the twoparties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some authors have formally diagrammed and discussed the negotiatingrange of unrelated parties.\3\<NOTE/> The basic premise is that the parties are concerned withthe split of the net income from the product. Baranson reports that Bendixofficials ``indicated that, if a broad cross-section of American industrywere polled, one would find that the average goal is a return to the licensorequal to about one-third of the profit of a well-run, well-establishedlicensee with a broad market.''\4\<NOTE/> Caves <T3>et al, </T3>find that the licensor will capture an average of fortyper cent of the expected profits that remain after the deduction of a normalreturn on capital. According to their sample, the range of the split leavesone-third to one-half of the profits to the licensor.\5\<NOTE/> Contractor's overview of the literature suggests that licensors``should settle for a 25 to 30 percent share of the licensee's incrementalprofit.'' \6\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>F.

They do show that unrelatedparties enter negotiations for a license agreement with expectations aboutthe total profits that they think will be earned from the exploitationof the intangible, and about the share of the profit that they can expectto receive.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">C. Payment Terms for a License</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Although the goal is to capture a portion of the profits, the provisionsin license agreements rarely specify that a percentage of the profits willbe paid as compensation for the right to exploit the intangible. This maybe because the licensor fears that the accounting for profits can be manipulatedtoo easily by a licensee, who may be able to choose what costs are included.Instead, a royalty that is a percentage of the net selling price is typicallychosen.\7\<NOTE/> Fifty-eight percent of the agreements in the SEC sample useda royalty based on the net selling price.\8\<NOTE/> This means of achieving the split of profits from the intangibleleads to a more easily verifiable number for the licensor.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The net selling price is typically the price charged bythe licensee to unrelated parties on an f.o.b. factory basis after deductionfor state and local sales taxes and, sometimes, after deduction for quantitydiscounts.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Recall that the sample size is small and was not chosenrandomly. All percentages provided are purely illustrative and should notbe accorded the weight one would give to a larger, randomly selected sample.<ITAG tagnum="21">Of the SEC agreements that have royalties based on the net sellingprice, 40 percent have a constant royalty rate. Because costs vary overtime, a flat royalty rate will lead to a different profit split on a year-by-yearbasis. Therefore, an examination of the returns over the lifetime of theagreement is necessary to determine the true division of the profits. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some agreements apparently attempt to even out the returns earnedby varying the royalty rate. A number of different structures are possible.Some agreements have a royalty rate that declines over time; others arestructured so that the rate rises and then falls. Thirty percent of theSEC agreements that have royalties based on the net selling price varythe royalty rate over the years of the agreement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The remaining 30 percent of agreements with royalties based on thenet selling price vary the royalty rate based on total sales of the product.This structure may be most clearly tied to the returns that the licensorrequires. It may also provide incentives to the licensee; this aspect willbe discussed below. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Not all compensation packages are based on a percentage of the netselling price. Eighteen percent of the agreements in the SEC sample requirea royalty per unit. Once again, the royalty per unit may be constant orit may change as more units are sold. In the SEC sample, 60 percent ofthe royalties per unit were constant, and 40 percent declined per unitas the number of units increased. The licensor may prefer to base the royaltyon units sold instead of on net selling price if the licensee is contemplatingdiscounts or if the intangible may be sold as part of a larger package,such as when software is distributed free of charge to the buyer of a computer.In the SEC sample, 80 percent of the royalty per unit agreements occurredin licenses for computer software. Computer software would seem to be thetype of product for which ``free'' samples may be provided or which maybe part of a package deal. Indeed, 67 percent of the sample agreementsin the SIC code for ``Computer Programming and Software'' contain royaltiesper unit.\9\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ This product specific use of a certain type of royaltybase is the type of information that one would hope to find in more situationsafter a thorough examination of the SEC data. <ITAG tagnum="21">Some agreements combine advance or lump sum fees with a royalty basedon sales or units. Different factors might explain these payments in differentsettings. If the licensee's country of incorporation limits the allowableroyalty rate, an initial lump-sum fee might be used to ensure that thelicensor earns the required return.\10\<NOTE/> Alternatively, the goal of a front-end fee may be to lowerthe licensor's risk by ensuring a minimum return. In the SEC sample, 16percent of the agreements with per unit or net selling price royaltiesalso have initial lump sum fees. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ If the licensee's country of incorporation intends tolimit the compensation flowing out of the country, attempts to providea lump sum payment may only serve to shift the analysis. In addition tolimiting the royalty rate, the country may also challenge the lump sumpayment. <ITAG tagnum="21">Another means of lowering the licensor's risk is for the licenseeto prepay a nonrefundable amount of money against which future royaltyobligations are credited. In addition, a minimum payment may be due eachyear. If the total royalties paid are less than this amount, the licenseemust pay the difference to the licensor. Forty-seven percent of the agreementswith per unit or net selling price royalties contain this type of arrangement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, a lump sum fee may provide the sole compensation for theuse of an intangible for a certain number of years. Twenty percent of theSEC agreements used a one time, lump sum payment or annual lump sum payments.Such an arrangement fixes the return that the licensor will receive. Thispayment scheme leaves the licensee to absorb all the variance in the amountearned. Just as in the minimum payment scheme, if the product is much lesspopular than expected, the licensee will absorb the loss. However, unlikethe minimum payment scheme, if the product is much more popular than expected,the licensee will reap all of the unexpected rewards. This type of arrangementcould provide a strong incentive to the licensee to concentrate resourceson selling the product.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Forcing the licensee to absorb the risk may not be the only reasonthat lump sum fees are chosen. The licensor may have patented a new techniqueor instrument that the licensee wishes to use to attempt to create anotherproduct. In this case there is no readily apparent unit to be produced,nor is anything being sold initially. Therefore, a lump sum fee may bethe only practical means of compensating the licensor for the use of thepatent. Lump sum fees may also be used to settle disputes over patent infringementclaims.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">D. Provisions Which May Affect Returns</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other clauses in the agreement, which do not explicitly affect payment,may affect the returns earned by the licensor and the licensee. For example,the licensor may require the licensee to perform a certain amount of marketing.This clause can be very specific, and may require that a certain amountbe spent or that a certain percentage of the licensee's marketing expendituresbe devoted to the licensor's product.\11\<NOTE/> Alternatively, the marketing or advertising clause may beopen-ended, requiring that the licensee use its ``best efforts.''\12\<NOTE/> Although such a clause does not readily translate into adollar figure, it potentially gives the licensor the ability to terminatethe agreement or to file suit if unsatisfied with the results.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ One agreement states that: [I]n each License Year duringthe term of this Agreement, Licensee shall expend a sum equal to 2% ofthe Net Sales of Licensed Products * * * for trade and consumer advertisingof Licensed Products under the Licensed Trademarks. All such advertisingshall be in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Licenseeshall furnish Licensor with copies of each such advertisement and withproof of such advertising expenditure.<ITAG tagnum="28">The agreement goes on to define advertising and to require that ``suchadvertising shall have been submitted to Licensor and received its priorwritten approval.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ One such clause reads: ``[Licensee] shall use its bestefforts to document, package, market, distribute, advertise and promotethe Use of the Software. All advertising and promotion * * * shall be undertakenat [the licensee's] expenses.  * * *''<ITAG tagnum="21">One might expect to find these clauses in licenses for products inwhich advertising plays a pivotal role in determining the success of theproduct. Indeed, in the SEC sample, these marketing or advertising clausesseem to be particularly prevalent in the SIC code for toilet preparations.Seventy-three percent of the agreements in the SEC sample that containadvertising clauses are for licenses with respect to clothing articlesor toilet preparations. Once again, certain features of agreements seemto be product specific. This suggests that a comprehensive analysis ofthe marketplace for intangibles should ideally focus on individual productgroups.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition to lowering the licensor's risk, these marketing clausesimply that the licensee is engaging in a significant economic activitybeyond the manufacture and distribution of the good that embodies the intangible.One would expect that the performance of this additional activity wouldaffect the returns that each party anticiapted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A major factor affecting the licensor's return from licensing theintangible is the amount of technical support required as a condition ofthe license. The total expense of transferring a technology to a licenseewill depend on the technology and on the licensee's level of expertise.Transfer costs include the physical transfer costs of plans, specifications,and designs, as well as the cost of training the licensee to make use ofthem. Since the licensor has typically already created the product beinglicensed, the cost of transferring the technology may be the biggest resourcecost to the licensor. Indeed, Contractor finds that the most importantfactor in determining the licensor's return on an agreement is the amountof technical services provided.\1\\3\<NOTE/> By carefully limiting the amount of service automaticallyprovided, the licensor can minimize uncertainty of return from the transfer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ Contractor, <T3>supra </T3>n. 3, at 123, n. 6.<ITAG tagnum="21">Additional technical support is sometimes provided on a time and expensebasis.\1\\4\<NOTE/> The split between ``free'' technical support and additionalsupport for which the license is charged varies depending on the circumstances.Additional detail would be necessary to test hypotheses concerning howexpectations about technical support affect technical assitance provisionsand how these provisions affect the whole licensing package. The SEC datareveal a variety of solutions to the technical assistance question. Someset a specific time period for ``free'' technical support.\1\\5\<NOTE/> Others require that techncial assistance be reimbursed atcost,\1\\6\<NOTE/> at a fixed rate,\1\\7\<NOTE/> or at the lowest rate charged by the licensor to third parties.\1\\8\<NOTE/> As is true of the marketing clauses in a licensing agreement,a licensor may need to balance the desire to push all of the technicalcosts onto the licensee with the need to ensure that the licensed intangibleis used productively.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ Baranson, <T3>supra </T3>n. 4, atg 65, n. 4.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ A license for the design, use, and sale of laser accessorieswith a per unit royalty provides: Upon [licensee's] request, [licensor]shall give or shall cause to be given to [licensee] such technical assistanceand shall give or shall cause to be given to [licensee's] employees suchtraining for 6 months after the date hereof as [licensee] may reasonablyrequire in connection with the transfer of technology provided in the precedingparagraph * * *.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ A license to manufacture and sell clothing using thelicensor's trademark with a royalty based on net sales notes: Licensoragrees to furnish technical aid to the licensee (including informationconcerning advertising, packaging and customer lists) if requested in writing,provided that the licensee pays all of the expenses for such aid. * * *<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ A 1985 license agreement to modify and sell softwarewhere the license makes regular, fixed royalty payments says: [Licensor]agrees to provide technical assistance concerning the Software to licensee,upon request by Licensee, in the development of the Modified Software;provided, however, that in addition to all other sums payable under thisagreement, Licensee agrees to pay [licensor] the sum of $100.00 per hourfor all labor provided by [licensor], plus reimbursement for all expensesincurred by [licensor] in providing such technical assistance to Licensee.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ A license for the use of a new type of laser wherethe licensee provides fixed annual royalty payments requires: [Licensor]shall make available such technical assistance as [licensee] may reasonablyrequest for understanding or exploiting the Proprietary Technology at [licensor's]standard rates, and under terms that are no less favorable than those extendedto any of its other customers.<ITAG tagnum="73">E. Preparing for Surprises</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An arm's length license agreement is shaped by each party's expectationsabout costs, sales, and the overall profit potential from the use of theintangible. The parties' expectations may differ, and they may differ markedlyfrom the actual profit experience with the product. Therefore, even ifboth parties are pleased with the royalty rate to be paid, the level oftechnical services to be provided, and any marketing clauses or clauseson market restrictions, it is possible that future events will leave oneor both of the parties dissatisfied with the arrangement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There are two types of surprises from which the parties may desireprotection. One surprise occurs if further development of the intangiblesignificantly improves the product's profitability. The other occurs ifseveral years of actual profit experience lead to a change in expectationsabout future profitability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The first surprise is of particular concern to the licensor. In orderto insure against this risk, many license agreements contain ``grant back''or ``technology flowback'' clauses. These clauses specify that the licensorreceives, free of charge, any enhancements to the technology that are developedby the licensee. These clauses serve to discourage the licensee from doingits own Randamp;D and potentially competing with the licensor. They furtherprotect the licensor from losing out on serendipitous discoveries by thelicensee. Caves <T3>et al.</T3> found grant back clauses in 43 percent of the 257 agreementsthey studied. However, the clauses appeared 76 percent of the time in agreementsinvolving ``dominant product'' licensors.\1\\9\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ Caves, <T3>supra</T3> n. 5, at 261, n. 5. A dominant product is one that accountsfor more than 60% of a firm's sales. This classification relates only tothe level of the firm's diversification. It does not make any distinctionwith regard to the overall profitability of the product. <T3>Id. </T3>at 252.<ITAG tagnum="21">The second type of surprise, changes in the parties' expectationsabout future profitability, can create problems from which both licensorsand licensees may want relief. Termination clauses provide one kind ofprotection in these circumstances. In one agreement, a license for theuse of a trade name, the licensee was required to meet certain sales targets.This type of arrangement allows the licensor to exist from the deal orrenegotiate if the volume is insufficient to realize the expected returnsfrom the intangible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In other cases, termination clauses allowed the parties to end thecontract, without cause, after giving notice. This safety valve may notlead to actual termination but instead may offer an opportunity for renegotiationif one of the parties thinks that its returns are inadequate. The structureof termination clauses varies. Clauses may allow immediate termination,or they may require several years notice. Manufacturers' distributors cantypically be dropped by the manufacturer to whom they are under contracton 30 days' notice.\2\\0\<NOTE/> At the other end of the spectrum, some terminations withoutcause are tied to the length of a patent. However, not all agreements involvingpatent life specify such a long period before renegotiation is considered.Thirty-four percent of the SEC agreements provide for termination withoutcause for the licensee, while 21 percent allow the licensor to terminatewithout cause after a given period of time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ Galante, <T3>Quickie Divorce Curbs Sought By Manufacturer's Distributors, </T3>WallStreet Journal, July 13, 1987, at 25.<ITAG tagnum="21">Some agreements have no termination clause except for cause. Thereare several situations in which a license might be likely to lack a terminationclause. If the licensee was required to make a substantial initial investmentin order to make use of the intangible, one can hypothesize that the licenseewould not enter into the agreement if the licensor could easily pull outof the deal. Another type of agreement without a termination clause mightbe one involving the license of products, such as computer software, thathave a very short lifespan. In this case the relevant life is so shortthat termination is not a useful option; both parties must choose correctlythe first time. Related to this group are agreements that are scheduledto end after a specific, and relatively short, length of time. These agreementswill automatically be renegotiated if the parties wish to extend the license.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fifty-five percent of the SEC sample agreements allow no terminationexcept for cause. However, of this subset, 22 percent are agreements thathave a specified length of less than three years, and another six percentare agreements of five or six years in duration. These agreements seemto fall into the category of licenses with relatively short lengths.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Twenty-eight percent of the SEC sample agreements without a terminationclause (16 percent of the total sample) were agreements with a durationof ten years or more. More information on these licenses would need tobe gathered in order to test the hypothesis that extended licenses tendto exist when the licensee is required to make a substantial initial investment.\2\\1\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ In addition, representative information on all licenses,regardless of term, that require the licensee to make a substantial investmentwould be necessary in order to test the hypothesis that a large initialinvestment by the licensee leads to a license of long duration.<ITAG tagnum="21">Of the remaining agreements with no termination clause, 22 percentwere for agreements with lump sum payments and 22 percent were for agreementsof indeterminate length. The latter group typically specified that theagreement lasted until the patent expired; these patent expiration dateswere not readily available.\2\\2\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ These agreements could be of short duration; severalof the other license agreements in the sample were for patents with onlytwo three years left before expiration.<ITAG tagnum="21">The existence of termination clauses shows that companies are concernedabout their ability to predict the total profits from the exploitationof an intangible. Regardless of the existence of termination clauses, agreementsdo get renegotiated. The frequency of renegotiation would give informationabout the ``surprises'' that occurred and the companies' ability to predictthe outcome of a license agreement. Although it is not possible to makegeneral statements about the overall frequency of renegotiations or terminationsbased on the sample of agreements we examined, some examples of renegotiationswere found. A license to manufacture and sell clothing under a trademarkwas renegotiated in the second year of a six year term. The amended agreementprovided the licensor with a royalty rate, based on net selling price,one percentage point higher than the original rate. However, the new agreementalso lowered the percentage of the net selling price to be spent by thelicensee on advertising by one-half a percentage point.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other agreements provide clear evidence that the parties contemplatedthe possibility that renegotiation might be necessary. One agreement, withno termination clause, provides for renegotiation of the royalty rate afterthree years. At that time, ``[B]oth the royalty rate and the scope of thePatented Portions will be renegotiated * * * [to] aggregate to not lessthan 1.5 percent and not more than 2.5 percent of the Royalty Portion sellingprice of such Licensed Products.'' Another agreement provides for renegotiationafter certain events occur, instead of after a certain time period. Thisis a 15 year agreement which the licensee can terminate on six months'notice. It says: ``Licensor or Licensee are unable at the Effective Dateof this Agreement to value on a proportionate basis the future worth toLicensee of the rights presently owned by Licensor in the TechnologicalField * * *.'' The agreement goes on to provide for current royalty paymentsand for additional payments, depending on the outcome of certain events.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This discussion of terminations and renegotiations shows that thereis no single way of dealing with uncertainty. Ultimately, much more detailedanalysis would have to be undertaken to determine what circumstances leadunrelated parties to renegotiate or terminate contracts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">F. Conclusions and Recommendations</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The agreements filed with the SEC and those analyzed in the academicwork provide a body of information concerning arm's length transactionsinvolving intangible property. This body of information points out keyfactors that should be considered when determining the proper allocationof income in related party situations. The SEC data and other sources willbe further analyzed in greater detail following publication of this paper.For example, patterns might be disclosed between royalty rates and specificlevels of technical assistance, or marketing expenditures, either in generalor by specific industry groups. Moreover, a study of the prevalence of,and circumstances that trigger, termination or renegotiation clauses (aswell as the results following exercise of the clause) might be helpfulin determining when unrelated parties exercise these rights.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Appendix E_Examples of Methods for Valuing Transfers of Intangibles</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Preamble to Examples</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The examples that follow illustrate the principles and methods describedin Chapter 11. They are intended to set forth what the Service and Treasurybelieve is an ideal application of these principles and methods to specificfactual situations. They are intended to serve as guidance for taxpayersin planning their pricing transactions as well as for both taxpayers andthe Service on audit. In large part, the types of information set forthare based upon information used by IEs and economists on audit and usedby taxpayers or outside economists for planning purposes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In general, it is expected that the amount of information about comparabletransactions, rates of returns, and costs for a taxpayer's industry andclaimed comparable transactions will be the greatest following a full examinationof the taxpayer's return. But, as Chapter 3 makes clear, taxpayers havea burden to document contemporaneously, and to justify, their transferpricing policies and their return positions. The Service and Treasury recognizethe practicalities involved in locating and analyzing the type of informationset forth in certain of these examples when transactions are planned orreturns filed. In general, the taxpayer making a relatively minor investmentwould not be expected to have gathered and analyzed data outside of itsown knowledge or its business affairs and those of its competitors. AsChapter 3 indicates, however, a taxpayer engaging in a transaction involvinghigh profit intangibles should arguably be expected to gather and analyzethe type of information set forth in certain of the examples, to the extentthat it is available, contemporaneously with the transaction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Example 1: Exact Comparable </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Hydrangea, Inc. is a U.S. developer, producer, and marketer of businesssoftware for personal computers. It has developed a new line of specializedaccounting software that it expects to sell mainly in foreign markets.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Hydrangea expects that this product will have a life cycle similarto most other products in its line. Thus, it expects that this softwarewill have a peak productive life of three to five years. If it is moderatelysuccessful, there will be a small, declining market after that, as obsolescencesets in. If the product is very successful, Hydrangea may decide to developan enhanced, substantially modified version after the peak period, whichit would treat as a new product. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Hydrangea has decided to serve the market in country F for this softwareby licensing it to an unrelated country F corporation, Fleur, with whichit has had satisfactory dealings in the past. Specifically, Hydrangea andFleur have negotiated a licensing agreement with the following terms. Fleurreceives an exclusive license to market Hydrangea's product in countryF and agrees to pay Hydrangea 20 percent of the net selling price for eachcopy it sells. Fleur agrees not to market competing products while thelicense is in effect. Fleur will market the product under its brand nameand will perform the necessary work to modify the product to integrateit into its own line of accounting software. Hydrangea agrees to provideFleur, for free, with any corrected, revised, and enhanced versions ofthe software that it releases publicly during the first four years. (Fleurand Hydrangea understand that, after that period, the latter is permittedto develop an enhanced, substantially modified product and to call fornew negotiations with Fleur, find another licensee, or market the new productitself.) The agreement grants Fleur a perpetual license to the currentproduct. During the first four years, neither party can terminate withoutcause; after that period, Fleur can terminate with six months' notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Hydrangea will serve the market in country B through its wholly ownedlocal subsidiary, Royal Hydrangea. The markets in countries F and B aresubstantially similar in size, sophistication, and ability to use businesssoftware intended for personal computers. Royal Hydrangea performs thesame functions as Fleur relating to marketing and distribution of accountingsoftware. Thus, it will modify the product as necessary for local requirements;it has been and will continue to be responsible for marketing its productsand developing its trademark; and, it maintains a distribution network,including a sales staff. For these reasons, Hydrangea concludes the externalstandards for using the Fleur agreement as an exact comparable are satisfied.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Hydrangea satisfies the internal standards by including all importantfeatures of the Fleur agreement in its agreement with Royal Hydrangea.Thus, the royalty is set at 20 percent of net selling price. The provisionsconcerning corrections and revisions are also, therefore, included, asare the provisions concerning duration and termination. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Each year, Hydrangea reexamines its related party arrangement to determineif the exact comparable approach is still valid. Specifically, it determineswhether the two markets are still similar, and whether Fleur and RoyalHydrangea still perform similar functions. If these aspects of the externalstandards have substantially changed, or if Fleur terminates its agreement,Hydrangea must reestablish the appropriateness of its related party transaction,which may require adjusting the royalty rate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Example 2: Unavailability of Comparables</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A U.S. company has developed a unique good that it believes will capture80 percent of the relevant market. The U.S. company plans to produce thegood in the United States and to license the rights to production and salefor the rest of the world to its foreign subsidiary. The U.S. company canfind no examples of situations in which an unrelated party licensed therights to production for a product that captured such a large share ofthe market. Therefore, the company should use the arm's length return methodin order to set the appropriate royalty rate with its foreign subsidiary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Example 3: Inexact Comparable</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Shampoo Inc., a well known hair-care products corporation in the UnitedStates, plans to set up a subsidiary in country Z in order to introduceits line of products in country Z. The subsidiary will manufacture, distribute,and market the products using the Shampoo trademark. When planning theappropriate transfer price for the lincense, Shampoo officials startedwith the knowledge that one of their competitors, Condition Corp., licenseda line of hair-care products to an unrelated party in country Z, Lotions,Inc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Condition license covers the formulas for all of Condition's hair-careproducts as well as the Condition trademark. The license gives Lotionsthe right to manufacture, distribute, and market the licensed products.Terms include an exclusive license in country Z for a term of four yearspaying a royalty of four percent of the net selling price. The licensoragrees to provide the licensee with product formulations, scientific data,manufacturing know-how, marketing, public relations, and related assistance.The licensee must adhere to strict quality control standards in manufacturing,distribution, and marketing. The licensor has the right to inspect operationsof the licensee to verify such quality. The licensee is prohibited frommanufacturing, importing, or marketing competing products in country Z.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">From the terms of the agreement it is clear that Lotions performsthe same functions that Shampoo's subsidiary in country Z will perform.It is also clear that Condition provides the same type of services andquality control for Lotion's operations that Shampoo will provide for itssubsidiary in country Z. It is anticipated that Shampoo's subsidiary willhave a volume of sales similar to Lotion's once its operations are fullydeveloped. Finally, Shampoo knows that the gross margin, (net sales^costof sales)/net sales, on sales of Shampoo's products in the United Statesis similar to the gross margin achieved by Condition in the United States,which indicates that their manufacturing processes and sales activitieshave comparable efficiencies. Therefore, it is appropriate for Shampooto set a royalty rate of four percent of the net selling price for a fouryear term.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Example 4: Likely Use of Inexact Comparables</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Computers Inc., a U.S. software company that specializes in games,plans to acquire the rights to manufacture, market, and distribute a newcomputer game, Gizmo, created by its European subsidiary. Gizmo will bean addition to Computers' existing line of games. Computers Inc. projectsthat the total number of Gizmo copies distributed will be close to theindustry average. Numerous third party licenses for computer software areavailable. Computers examines these licenses for appropriate inexact comparablesand should be able to determine the appropriate royalty amount and otherterms for its agreement with its affiliate from the third party agreements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Example 5: Basic Arm's Length Return Method: U.S. Importer and Distributor</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">TravelFun is a large publicly traded foreign corporation with a U.S.subsidiary, TravelUS. TravelFun produces a unique recreational productusing sophisticated and highly sought-after production technology. TravelUSimports the assembled product and distributes it under the Travel name.TravelUS has the exclusive right to develop the Travel name in the UnitedStates. Because of the importance of the intangibles, TravelUS must applythe rules governing the transfer of intangible property.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">TravelFun does not license the Travel name to unrelated parties, nordoes it allow unrelated parties to distribute the product. Therefore, noexact comparables are available. Similar products exist that could potentiallyserve as inexact comparables; however, none of them are sold to unrelateddistributors. Therefore, when TravelFun sets up its policy for transferprices of units sold into the United States for 1989 it uses the rate ofreturn method. In order to apply the method properly, the following informationis necessary: (1) A general description of the functions that TravelUSperforms, (2) financial information on companies performing similar functions,and (3) analyses of appropriate rates of return.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) <T3>Functions of TravelUS. </T3>TravelUS imports the product from TravelFunand distributes it to retailers.

Examination of thesefirms' published financial information indicates that the sample shouldbe narrowed to 16 firms in order to reflect more clearly the functionsperformed by TravelUS. TravelUS is an importer that distributes final productsand performs an important marketing function. Each firm in the final samplehas some combination of these characteristics.

Comparable asset data are not availablefor all firms in the sample. Therefore, an attempt must be made to determinea rate of return for TravelUS based on available cost data for the sampleof firms. A number of ratios can be considered as a means of determiningan appropriate return on costs. Possibilities include the ratio of grossprofit to operating expenses (the Berry ratio), the ratio of operatingincome to the cost of sales and operating expenses, and the ratio of netpre-tax income to total expenses.

The subsidiary will manufacture,distribute, and market Counter's products in country Z. The manufacturingprocess is not particularly complex. The subsidiary will set up its owndistribution network, which will be of average size for the industry. Further,it will perform its own marketing; however, because the subsidiary will,in general, sell ``generic'' products that will sell under its customers'brand names and trademarks, its marketing activities will involve contactingdrug stores and other selling concerns, and not the development of a unique,consumer-level marketing intangible.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Counter's search for unrelated party licenses for comparable productsproves fruitless. The search does yield a number of licenses in which thefunctions performed by each party are similar. The products are not similarenough to over-the-counter drugs to be classified as inexact comparables;however, the level of manufacturing, the type of distribution network,and the type of marketing performed in each case are similar. Therefore,Counter searches for information about the returns earned by each of thesecompanies. Analysis of the income statements and balance sheets of thefirms in the sample yields an average rate of return earned. This averagecan be used by Counter to determine the royalty rate to be paid by itssubsidiary in country Z. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Example 7: Basic Arm's Length Return Method: Foreign Subsidiary Producingfor U.S. Market </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A U.S. corporation has developed and patented the formula for a newheart drug that has fewer potential side effects than any drug in existence.The U.S. corporation plans to manufacture the drug in a foreign subsidiaryto be located in country Y, which has very low labor costs.

Therefore, the parent turns tothe arm's length return method as the appropriate method. The parent willfind proper rates of return for the manufacturing and marketing segmentsof production and allocate to itself the residual profits. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A sample of manufacturers in locations with low labor costs showsthat manufacturers earn an average rate of return on their manufacturingassets of 12 percent.

Based on the costs outlined above, the parent should earnnet income of $3.6 million on its distribution and marketing activities,the Country X subsidiary should earn net income of $2.4 million. Revenuefrom the sale of the heart drug will be approximately $1800 million inthe United States and $1200 million in Europe. Therefore, the manufacturingsubsidiary should charge $1.98 per pill.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Total revenue received by the manufacturing subsidiary will be $2971million ($2970 million from sales and $1 million from interest income.)The royalty to be paid to the parent will be a percentage of the net saleprice of $1.98.

The parent has two options when setting its transfer pricing policy.If unrelated party licenses of trademarks for clothing can be located,then these inexact comparables can be used to establish appropriate termsfor the license agreement.

Itmaintains a large artificial intelligence research lab, which has madesignificant advances in computer vision. Recently, this work has begunto yield marketable products. Specifically, ABC has developed a ``sighted''numerically controlled machine tool (NCMT) that can be programmed to recognizethe pieces on which it should perform its fabrication tasks. ABC expectsthis new device to be a significant advance over competing NCMTs becausethe pieces will not have to be precisely aligned before the fabricationoperations can be performed; therefore, the ``sighted NCMT'' should bemuch easier to operate and integrate into an assembly line. The key elementin this advance is the software that allows the NCMT to determine the preciseposition and orientation of a piece placed on its operating deck. ABC hasobtained worldwide patent protection for this software. As is true of mostof ABC's products, the device must be substantially modified for each customer'sspecific application, and ABC maintains a large and expert engineeringstaff to accomplish this.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">ABC projects that devices based on the new technology will eventuallybecome an important source of revenues and profits for the company. Duringthe first three to five years, ABC expects to have no significant competitors,and plans to market the devices to the high price, high mark-up, low volume,most technologically advanced segment of the NCMT market. After that period,as the technology becomes more common, ABC expects that sighted NCMTS will,in general, replace other types of NCMTs and that its lead will enableit to capture a significant share, perhaps 50 percent or more, of the overallNCMT market.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">ABC-Europe is a wholly owned subsidiary of ABC incorporated in countryX. All of ABC's products currently sold in Europe are produced and marketedby this company. ABC-Europe maintains its own research and engineeringstaffs and manufactures all of the devices it sells. A majority of theproducts in its line involve technology licensed from ABC, but a significantfraction depend on technology developed through its own research efforts.ABC-Europe performs all of the marketing for Europe, and its engineeringstaff performs the necessary development work of the devices for each customer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">ABC plans to transfer the European rights to exploit the softwareand associated technology for sighted NCMTs to ABC-Europe. ABC has no plansto license the technology to an unrelated party; therefore, no exact comparableis available. ABC has conducted a search for inexact comparables; althoughthe search does turn up unrelated party transactions involving licensesof machine tool devices and patents, ABC has concluded that none of themcan meet the standards for the inexact comparable method. Specifically,none of the potential comparables are for devices which involve profitmargins as high as the sighted NCMTs will have in the short run, nor marketshares as large as ABC anticipates having in the long run.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">ABC next considers the basic arm's length return method. It concludesthat ABC-Europe's activities in exploiting the sighted NCMT technologycan be split into four functions: (a) Conducting research to search foruses in the European market, (b) marketing the devices, including participatingin trade shows, conducting demonstrations, and providing technical assistance(mass-market retail-level advertising is not necessary in this industry),(c) designing the specific devices to meet the requirements of each customer'sapplication, and (d) manufacturing and distributing the devices.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">ABC concludes that some but not all of these functions can be analyzedunder the basic arm's length return method. Once each customer's designhas been set, manufacture of the devices will not be much more complicatedthan current NCMTs, and ABC is familiar with firms that manufacture current-generationNCMTs according to others' designs. Therefore, ABC concludes that function(d) can be analyzed in this way; specifically, it concludes that a rateof return to operating assets of 16 percent is the average for firms thatperform this function. Marketing is not a major activity in this industry,because the customers are extremely knowledgeable. ABC deals with firmsthat perform marketing functions for it; based on its knowledge of thesefirms, ABC concludes that a 20-percent ratio of income to costs is a reasonableway to value the contribution of function (b).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Functions (a) and (c), however, cannot be analyzed in this way. ABC-Europe'sstaff of scientists and engineers, while smaller than ABC's, is still oneof the largest and most expert in Europe. ABC knows of no independent firmin the machine tool industry, in the United States or Europe, that wouldbe able to conduct research, development, or design work as satisfactorilyas or on a scale comparable to ABC-Europe. Therefore, ABC concludes thatit would be inappropriate to value the contributions that ABC-Europe'sperformance of these functions will make toward selling sighted NCMTs inEurope by multiplying the assets employed by a rate of return, or multiplyingthe costs incurred by an income-to-costs ratio. In short, a profit-splitapproach is necessary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Although ABC's search for comparables did not turn up appropriatelicenses in the machine tool industry, other transactions between unrelatedparties were found. For example, ABC obtained information about the followingtransaction: a group of professors, in partnership with their university,established a consortium to patent and exploit a process through whicha new product can be produced by a genetic engineering technique. The consortiumbargained at arm's length with several large chemical companies, and negotiateda licensing agreement with one of them. The licensee manufactures the product,tailors it to meet the specific needs of various groups of farmers, andmarkets it. The product has no significant competitors and has achievedwidespread use in certain important agricultural applications. The licenseepays the university consortium a royalty of $7 per pound.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">ABC next gathers information about the chemical company and the industryin which it operates. It is able to determine that the chemical companymaintains a large staff of scientists and engineers which performs functionsconcerning the new product that are comparable to the research and developmentactivities that ABC-Europe will perform. The chemical company undertakessignificantly more marketing activities than will ABC-Europe, and the manufacturingprocess for the product is not comparable. Further, ABC is able to determinethe following information: (a) The product sells for $27 per pound; (b)production costs are ten dollars per pound; (c) independent firms thatproduce chemicals using similar production techniques earn profits equalto 20 percent of cost; (d) marketing and distribution expenses are threedollars per pound, and (e) independent firms that perform similar marketingand distribution activities earn 33 percent of expenses.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This information allows ABC to determine the profit split betweenthe basic technology contributed by the university consortium, on the onehand, and the research, development, and application activities and know-howcontributed by the chemical company, on the other. Specifically, the latter'sprofit per pound, net of royalty and expenses, is seven dollars ($7=$27-$7-$10-$3).Of this amount, two dollars should be attributed to the manufacturing activityand one dollar to the marketing and distribution ($2=$10andmultiply;0.20,and $1=$3andmultiply;0.33). This leaves four dollars per unit as the returnto the chemical company's know-how and skills as to Randamp;D and applicationof technology to its customers' needs. The university's income is the sevendollars royalty. Therefore, the profit split is 64 percent (64 percent=7/(7+4))for the licensor's basic technology and 36 percent (36 percent=4/(7+4))for the intangibles employed by the licensee. (Note that the licensor andlicensee each earn 50 percent of the total profits, since they each earnseven dollars per pound; however, 50 percent vs. 50 percent is not therelevant profit split for this situation, because it does not distinguishbetween the profits for the manufacturing and marketing functions.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, ABC is able to determine the proper arrangement for its licenseto ABC-Europe. There are many ways ABC could structure the arrangement.One would simply be to specify that ABC-Europe (a) determine gross profitsfrom sales of sighted NCMTs (with gross profits defined as sales receiptsminus manufacturing and marketing costs), (b) subtract 16 percent of thevalue of assets used in manufacturing the devices, (c) subtract 20 percentof the marketing costs, (d) subtract 36 percent of the remainder, and,finally, (e) remit the remaining amount to ABC as a royalty.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Alternatively, ABC could use additional information about ABC-Europe'sfuture activities to set a more traditional licensing arrangement. ABC'sprojections for sales of sighted NCMTs in Europe during the first threeyears of operations include the following figures. The devices will sell,on average, for $100,000 each. Cost of production will be $56,000 and willrequire $50,000 of production assets per device. Marketing costs will be$5,000 per device. These projections imply that gross profits, definedas sales receipts minus manufacturing and marketing costs, equal $39,000per machine. Of this amount, ABC-Europe should be allocated $8,000 forthe manufacturing function and $1,000 for marketing ($8,000=$50,000andmultiply;0.16and $1,000=$5,000andmultiply;0.20). Remaining profits are thus $30,000 perdevice. This amount should be split 64 percent to ABC and 36 percent toABC-Europe; thus ABC should be allocated $19,200 per device and ABC-Europethe remaining $10,800. A more traditional licensing arrangement, therefore,would require that ABC-Europe pay ABC a royalty equal to 19.2 percent ofsales (19.2 percent=$19,200/$100,000).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If ABC chooses the former type of arrangement, periodic adjustmentsto it are less likely to be necessary, because the allocation of incomebetween ABC and its affiliate will automatically adjust to a large extent.ABC should reconsider periodically, however, whether the manufacturingrate of return to assets, the marketing income to cost ratio, and the profitsplit percentages are still appropriate. If ABC chooses the latter typeof licensing arrangement, many more periodic adjustments to it will likelybe necessary. Specifically, in addition to considering the preceding factors,ABC must determine if actual experiences depart from the projections enoughto imply significant changes in the appropriate allocation of income. Ifso, ABC will have to recalculate the sales based royalty rate by substitutingthe relevant actual figures for the projections in the preceding paragraph.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">Example 11: Profit Split Method Using Information About Relative Valuesof Preexisting Intangibles</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Teachem is a U.S. corporation that designs, produces, and marketseducational toys in the U.S. It maintains a staff of educational psychologistsand engineers to develop and design the toys, which are perceived as uniquelyhigh quality and sell at a premium. Enseignerem is a wholly owned affiliateof Teachem and is incorporated in country F. It is one of the largest toycompanies in Europe. It was, and still is, the largest toy company in countryF when it was acquired by Teachem a number of years ago. Enseignerem incurslarge advertising and other marketing costs to develop its trademark andreputation as a producer of high quality educational toys. It is responsiblefor its own marketing strategies, which are different in important respectsfrom Teachem's marketing efforts in the United States. For example, Enseigneremmaintains a large sales force that calls on schools and other institutions,and institutional sales account for a much larger proportion of its revenues.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Teachem has recently developed a new line of electronic toys and intendsto license the European rights to the designs to Enseignerem. Teachem doesnot plan to license them to any unrelated parties; therefore, an exactcomparable is not available. Further, Teachem expects that Enseigneremwill be able to capture its usual high market share, especially in theinstitutional market, and will be able to sell the toys for its usual significantpremiums over its competitors. For these reasons, Teachem decides thatsuitable inexact comparables will probably not be available.</ITAG>Teachem next considers the basic arm's length return method. Enseigneremwill perform three functions with respect to the new line of toys. It willbe responsible for manufacturing them; specifically, it will negotiatecontracts and supervise independent contract manufacturers who will actuallyproduce the toys. Second, it will distribute them. Third, Enseignerem willbe responsible for all aspects of marketing them.The first two functions can be analyzed under the basic arm's length returnmethod. Teachem projects that the new toys will sell for $100 each in Europe.Payments to the contract manufacturers will be approximately $40 per toy.Enseignerem has found that distribution costs, including transportationand costs of holding inventories, are usually one-half of production costs,and expects that the new line will be typical in this regard. Therefore,Teachem projects that distribution costs will be $20 per toy. Finally,Enseignerem expects to incur costs of four dollars per toy relating tothe supervision of the contract manufacturers. These costs include thesalaries of engineers who will be assigned to visit and test the contractors,and premiums for liability insurance.In some of its product lines, Enseignerem employs contract manufacturerswho are willing to distribute, as well as produce, the items. By comparingthese contracts with those calling for manufacturing only, Teachem concludesthat the independent firms that perform distribution earn a return forit equal to 25 percent of the distribution costs. Teachem therefore allocatesfive dollars per toy to Enseignerem for the distribution function ($5=$20x0.25).Teachem also decides that a 25 percent income-to-costs ratio is appropriatefor the first function, responsibility for manufacturing. Thus, Teachemallocates one dollar per toy to the affiliate as the return for performingit ($1=$4x0.25).Teachem decides that the affiliate's final function, marketing, cannotbe analyzed by the basic method. Enseignerem is not planning to incur anysignificant costs attributable solely to the new toys. In general, it focusesits advertising on promoting the Enseignerem reputation rather than displayinga single item, and does not plan to issue a separate catalog or set upa separate sales force for the new line. Therefore, Teachem decides thatit is not possible to identify or measure the costs or assets that Enseigneremwill devote to the new product line. However, it would clearly be wrongto conclude that Enseignerem deserves no return for the marketing function,because its preexisting reputation, sales force, and knowledge of its marketare crucial to the success of the new product line in Europe. Therefore,a profit split is necessary.To summarize the analysis to this point, the toys are projected to earna gross profit of $36 each ($36=$100^$40^$20^$4). Of this amount, six dollarsshould be allocated to Enseignerem for the functions analyzed with thebasic method. Thus, $30 per toy is left as the combined return to Teachem'sproduct designs and Enseignerem's trademark, sales force, and other marketingintangibles. The next step is to split these profits in a way that reflectsthe relative economic values of these sets of intangibles.Teachem concludes that the new line of toys is similar to other lines thatthe corporate group has introduced in the past few years in terms of theimportance of the underlying design relative to marketing intangibles.Specifically, the designs involved a typical amount of research and developmenteffort and the toys will be marketed in ways similar to, and with similarintensity as, other products. Teachem analyzes its own performance recordand educational toy industry information on the relative importance ofdesign and marketing intangibles therein. Based on a good faith analysisof this data, Teachem concludes that it is reasonable to assign a relativevalue of the design intangibles equal to one-half the value of marketingintangibles. Accordingly, it allocates ten dollars of the $30 to be splitto itself and the remaining $20 to Enseignerem.Teachem can structure the arrangement in any form that achieves the appropriateallocation of income, ten dollars per toy to the parent and $20 to Enseignerem.Specifically, it could establish an agreement in which Enseignerem paysTeachem a royalty for the European rights to the product designs at a rateof ten percent of sales. In future years, Teachem must reexamine its arrangementand, if any key element in the analysis described above changes significantly,must adjust the royalty rate accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="81">Example 12: Likely Use Of Profit Split Method</ITAG>The research staff of a European company that manufactures and marketsfood products has just created a chemical compound that will alter theway that the human digestive system reacts to sugar. The company believesthat by adding the compound to its products, the products will pass throughthe human digestive system without being absorbed. The compound is uniquebecause it leaves the taste of the product unchanged. No information isknown about the possible side effects of this compound. The company wantsto use this discovery to offer a whole line of diet products. The Europeancompany has a U.S. subsidiary that presently manufactures and markets existingproducts in the United States. The U.S. subsidiary also has a researchstaff. Because the prime market for this new product is the weight-consciousUnited States, the parent licenses the compound to the U.S. subsidiaryfor development and for the extensive and expensive testing that will benecessary in order to obtain approval from the Food and Drug Administration.Because the product is unique and because the subsidiary performs suchcomplex functions, the profit split arm's length return method is probablymost appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="81">Example 13: Periodic Adjustments To Reflect Changes in Functions</ITAG>A U.S. corporation produces and markets widgets in the United States andit has a subsidiary in country X that produces and markets widgets in Europe.The U.S. parent is in the early stages of developing a new super-widget.In 1988 it is clear that this could be a major breakthrough in widget technology;however, the manufacturing process is still cumbersome. It is unclear whetherthe process can be developed to the point that it would be possible tomass-produce the super-widget. The U.S. parent believes that the team ofemployees at its subsidiary in country X is best suited for the time-consumingand expensive job of developing the process to produce the super-widget.In determining an appropriate transfer price for the license of the technology,the parent can find no inexact comparable for the super-widget. Similarly,the basic arm's length return method is not feasible because neither partyis performing standardized functions. Therefore, the U.S. parent attemptsa profit split analysis.Based on the best information available in 1988, the U.S. corporation predictsthat the development process should be completed by 1994. An increasingnumber of super-widgets will be produced between 1988 and 1994; however,only in 1994 will true assembly-line style production be feasible. Basedon an analysis of the relative costs incurred by the parent and by thesubsidiary, and on an analysis of the relative returns earned by unrelatedparties when risky products are jointly developed, a 50-50 profit spliton the returns of the design of the super-widget is adopted by the parent.By the end of 1989, as the parent is filing its 1989 tax returns and isrechecking its transfer price policy for 1990, super-widgets are beingsuccessfully mass-produced at close to the volume predicted for 1994. Insteadof requiring the extended development process predicted two years earlier,establishing production was more similar to the effort necessary when adjustingproduction lines for improved versions of products. Accordingly, the parentadjusts its transfer price policy to a basic arm's length return analysisfor its subsidiary in country X. Specifically, the parent determines theaverage rate of return earned by independent companies that manufacturea product similar in complexity to super-widgets. Because the parent isparticularly cautious and feels it would be difficult to sustain its profitsplit for 1989, it also modifies the 1989 policy to a rate of return analysis.While at the outset of this transaction it appeared that the subsidiaryin country X would be required to use significant intangibles of its ownto establish the production process, the actual experience of the partieswas that no unique intangibles were contributed by the subsidiary. Thedecrease of five years in the time expected to develop production to the1994 level constitutes a significant change that requires an adjustment.<ITAG tagnum="81">Example 14: Periodic Adjustments to Reflect Changes in Indicatorsof Profitability</ITAG>A U.S. pharmaceutical company has patented the formula for a new anti-arthriticdrug with fewer side effects that those in existence. The U.S. parent'ssubsidiary in country Y will manufacture the drug and market it worldwide.There are numerous third party licenses for the existing anti-arthriticdrugs. The parent decides that these products are comparable because itfeels that its product will be a close competitor to them, and will sellfor a similar price and capture a similar market share. Specifically, itbelieves that its drug will capture approximately 15 percent of the market,as do several of the existing products. The parent uses the eight percentroyalty on net selling price that is found in those licenses and adoptsother significant features of such licenses as well. For example, the lengthof the agreement is for the length of the patent.The U.S. parent reviews its license with the subsidiary at the start ofyear two and finds that its drug has only an eight percent market share.However, the market share seems to be continuing to grow. Indeed, at thebeginning of year three its market share is 16 percent and at the beginningof year four its market share is 21 percent. In each of these years theU.S. parent decides that the inexact comparable is still appropriate.By the end of year four the popularity of this drug has skyrocketed andit captures 50 percent of the market. Since this share of the market isfar beyond that captured by any of the third party licenses, it can nolonger be assumed that the level of overall profitability for the productlicensed to the related party is similar to that for the products licensedto unrelated parties. Specifically, to the extent that market share isan indication of the mark-up that can be charged on a product, the relatedparty product, which captures 50 percent of the market, is probably muchmore profitable than products that capture only 15 percent of the market.Therefore, the present inexact comparables are not longer valid. A searchfor other inexact comparables fails to produce a license involving a similarmarket share. Therefore, the parent turns to a basic arm's length returnanalysis to determine what its subsidiary should earn.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-24618 Filed 10-26-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4830-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
