Former Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts scored a big winon Tuesday, but financial, geographical and chronologicalfactors give Bill Clinton the best chance to win theDemocratic nomination. With the most money and with thecampaign now turning to his native South, Mr. Clinton is in amuch better position to win nearly a dozen primaries in athree-week period.</LP><TEXT>   But the Arkansas governor spent much of the last two weekson the defensive, first from charges of marital infidelityand then from news accounts saying he angled to avoid thedraft during the Vietnam years. He shored up his supportamply enough to finish a strong second in New Hampshire, butmany Democratic party leaders, officeholders and voters --even in the South -- are unsettled with the notion that hecould head the party's ticket.   &quot;There are question marks about character all over theguy,&quot; says Earl Black, a University of South Carolinaspecialist in southern politics. &quot;They are not going to goaway. He's just building a record that will provide theRepublicans with a lot of ammunition.&quot;   Mr. Clinton's finish in New Hampshire, however, keeps hisprospects alive and propels him toward safe political ground-- and makes it vastly more difficult for another Democraticpolitical figure to plunge into the race.   Last week, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt was veryclose to entering the race; his calculations, according tothose familiar with the Missouri lawmaker's plans, were basedon Mr. Clinton showing so poorly that he was driven out ofthe race or written out of it. At the same time, those closeto Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, invoking the same contingencies, werequietly exploring a plan for the 1988 vice presidentialnominee to jump into the 1992 race with a vow to serve only asingle term, and if elected, to tackle the nation's budgetand economic problems without worries about winningre-election.   Although political professionals don't rule out thepossibility of new candidates, Mr. Clinton's strong showingdidn't provide the opening or pretext for either of thoseplans or for others circulating in the capital. &quot;The biggestproblem for someone trying to enter the race now is thatthere's no cause,&quot; says Peter Hart, a Democratic politicalpollster. &quot;It would only be personal ambition.&quot;   Yet as filing deadlines for late primaries approach andpass -- the deadline for entering the Ohio primary on May 5,for example, is today -- there remains hunger for a lateentrant. &quot;We've kind of outsmarted ourselves by making thisprocess go so fast,&quot; says John White, a former Democraticnational chairman. &quot;Now, we're stuck in a position with avery vulnerable president, and we can't present the very bestwe have. We should try to get some others in this race,because we can win this.&quot;   Mr. Clinton, meanwhile, is a damaged but attractivecandidate in the wake of a day of balloting where Washingtonestablishment figures and incumbents did poorly. He displayedgreat grit in not succumbing to the charges against him andin battling back. Moreover, he has deployed an impressivenational campaign, and he clearly plans to take maximumadvantage of his southern base and to compete in a three-weekmarathon in which 1,325 delegates, or just under a third ofall convention delegates, are selected. House Speaker ThomasFoley yesterday proclaimed Mr. Clinton the &quot;front-runner atthe moment.&quot; He also, mistakenly, referred to Mr. Tsongas as&quot;Sen. Dukakis.&quot;   &quot;We have to work backwards from the cornerstones --Georgia and South Carolina -- and then prepare to fight onall fronts,&quot; says George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's deputycampaign manager. &quot;We're the only ones who can.&quot;   Mr. Clinton's great advantage, however, is in movingtoward the Southern primaries with an opponent virtuallyunknown in the region.   &quot;I don't know of a single elected official, a single partyplayer or even a single individual who is for Tsongas,&quot; saysJames Brady, the Democratic chairman in Louisiana. &quot;Peoplehave never even heard of him.&quot;   Mr. Clinton's campaign infrastructure reaches deep intothese states. In Louisiana, for example, the governor, bothsenators, all the Democratic House members, the speaker andspeaker pro tempore of the state House, the president andpresident pro tempore of the state Senate, the mayor of NewOrleans and at least 100 other elected officials are with Mr.Clinton. In Texas, Mr. Clinton has been endorsed by half theDemocratic state legislators, the state arm of the NationalEducation Association, the steelworkers' and governmentworkers' unions, and the leaders of the top Mexican-Americanand black political groups.   &quot;For anybody else to do well in Texas,&quot; says RobertSlagle, the state party chairman, &quot;Clinton has to dosomething to himself -- something very bizarre.&quot;   Walter Mondale, who lost the New Hampshire primary in 1984to Gary Hart, bore witness to the fragility of a campaignbased on endorsements from politicians and lawmakers. Indeed,much of the Clinton support is soft, and some leadingpolitical figures say privately they would abandon hiscampaign if a stronger candidate came along.   Moreover, Mr. Clinton's letter thanking an ROTC officialfor &quot;saving me from the draft&quot; has raised questions about himin the South. &quot;This is very patriotic country, and he haslost a chance to get a lot of good-ole-boy votes he mightotherwise get,&quot; says William Blount, the state party chairmanin Alabama. &quot;But he's still the big favorite.&quot;   Meanwhile, the entire Democratic field faces newchallenges as the campaign moves from one tiny state, wherethe candidates campaigned for months, to a series of states,an adjustment akin to switching in an instant from ahalf-court basketball game to a full-court, full-speed game.   &quot;That means they have to really broaden their messages,&quot;says John Sasso, a Democratic consultant who plotted MichaelDukakis's route to the nomination four years ago. &quot;They haveto go from retail politics to wholesale politics. They haveto sharpen their themes and make the case for change; peoplein these later states aren't going to be reading 75-pagebooklets on the issues like they did in New Hampshire.&quot;   That challenge is greatest for Mr. Tsongas. In Maine'scaucuses this weekend, though Mr. Clinton has a strong base,Mr. Tsongas can again play the regional favorite. &quot;NewHampshire historically has a big influence on us,&quot; saysFrederick Barton, a former state party chairman in Maine.&quot;We've been watching the same news and seeing the same ads asthey've been seeing. It leads us to conclude that the resultwill be similar.&quot;   But to dismiss qualms that he has little appeal beyond NewEngland, Mr. Tsongas then will need a strong showing in theMarch 3 primary in Maryland, a state where Mr. Clinton'ssouthern tentacles aren't as strong.   As Mr. Tsongas struggles to reap the momentum from his NewHampshire victory, the remaining Democratic candidates areseeking opportunities to show that their campaigns still havepromise. Both Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Sen. Bob Kerrey ofNebraska have targeted next Tuesday's primary in SouthDakota, hoping that a victory there might help them raisesufficient money to carry the fight forward.   Mr. Kerrey hopes to pre-empt the other candidates inColorado, which holds its primary March 3, to ambush Mr.Clinton the same day in Georgia and to nudge along by winningcaucuses in small states such as Utah, Idaho and Wyoming.Both he and Mr. Harkin need victories to keep their campaignsalive, but the chances are that at least one of the two willsoon be eliminated from the race.   Although the write-in effort for Gov. Mario Cuomo fizzledin New Hampshire and is likely to do so in Maine, the shadowof the New York governor remains over the contest. Thoseclose to him have mapped out a plan they would invoke if Mr.Kerrey withdrew from the race. Under this plan, according tothose who have discussed it with Cuomo associates, thegovernor and Mr. Kerrey would become a team, with Mr. Kerrey,as vice presidential candidate, campaigning during the weekand Mr. Cuomo leaving Albany only on weekends. They would asktheir supporters to vote for delegate slates that are alreadyassembled in Mr. Kerrey's name. The Kerrey camp, for itspart, disclaims interest in such a scheme.   But the longer the campaign goes on and the better Mr.Clinton does, the better, too, are the chances that theArkansas governor will become the party nominee.   With the proportional representation rules that theDemocrats are using, it becomes hard for a challenger todefeat a front-runner with margins large enough to preventhim from continuing to add delegates to his count. &quot;You don'thave the opportunity to go to Illinois any more and take 80%of the delegates with 50% of the votes,&quot; says AnthonyCorrado, a Colby College political scientist and rules expertworking for Mr. Kerrey's campaign.   If Mr. Clinton can reach 40% of the delegates as the endof the primaries approaches, the structure of the rules, plusthe hope of party leaders to bring the contest to a swiftconclusion, almost certainly would deliver the nomination tohim.</TEXT></DOC>
