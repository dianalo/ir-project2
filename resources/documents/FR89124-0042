Both speciesgrow on oil shale outcrops that are primarily over a range of approximately15 miles along two adjacent drainages, Piceance and Yellow Creeks, in PiceanceBasin. The twinpod also occurs on two localities on Calamity Ridge 12 milesto the west of these two drainages. They are known from five populationseach, two of which occur together. Most of these sites are on public landadministered by the Bureau of Land Management, with portions of three twinpodsites along Piceance Creek and Calamity Ridge on private and one one bladderpodsite along Yellow Creek on Colorado Division of Wildlife land. No Federalor State laws protect the two species on these sites. Within the oil shalerich Piceance Basin, the Dudley Bluffs bladderpod and twinpod occur inthe multimineral oil shale zone, an area containing rich deposits of oilshale in the mahogany zone and sodium minerals, nahcolite (sodium bicarbonate)and dawsonite (a potential source of alumina) in the saline zone. If projectdesigns for development of these deposits do not include planning for conservationof these two mustards, which only occur here, both species could be significantlyimpacted. This proposal, if made final, would implement Federal protectionprovided by the Act for <T3>Lesquerella congesta</T3> and <T3>Physaria obcordata</T3>. The Service seeks data and comments from thepublic on this proposal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments from all interested parties must be received byMarch 27, 1989.

Theywere subsequently described by Dr. Reed Rollins, an expert on the mustardfamily, who visited Piceance Basin and observed them at Dudley Bluffs in1983 (Rollins 1983, Rollins 1984). These two herbaceous perennials arethe rarest of several oil shale plant species in the Piceance Basin.<T3>L. congesta</T3> is an extremely small cushion plan only 1-3 centimeters(0.4-1.2 inches) in diameter with fruiting stems up to 1.5 centimeters(0.6 inches) tall. The cushion growth habit is an adaptation to erosivebadland soils which has independently evolved in several unrelated taxain this area. It has small linear, entire, silvery leaves 8-13 millimeters(0.3-.5 inches) long; bright yellow flowers; and rounded, pubescent fruits,2.5-3.5 millimeters (0.10-0.14 inches) wide. <T3>P. obcordata</T3> is 12-18 centimeters (4.8-7.2 inches) tall with oblanceolate,entire leaves 1.0-1.5 centimeters (0.4-0.6 inches) wide and 4.0-8.0 centimeters(1.6-3.8 inches) long, with a silvery sheen due to a dense covering ofoverlapping, dish-shaped trichomes. It has yellow flowers, 7-9 millimeters(0.3-0.4 inches) long, and slightly inflated, heart-shaped (obcordata)fruits.These two rare mustards grow on steep, barren outcrops derived from a mixtureof calcareous sandstone and shale strata which are exposed along drainagesthrough erosion from downcutting of streams in the Piceance Basin. Thesurrounding hills and mesas which support pinyon-juniper woodlands alsocontain scattered outcrops of habitat tht support <T3>L. congesta. </T3>These strata are derived from the Eocene Green Riverand Unita Formations (Cashion and Donnell 1974). The rich oil shale bearingGreen River Formation formed as a lacustrine deposit in Lake Uinta, formingfine textured shale. Later, Lake Uinta filled with sand and silt depositswhich are the coarser grained Uinta Formation. At the interface of thesetwo formations, the lakebed Green River Formation shale intertongues withthe deltaic and fluvial sandstones and siltstones of the Uinta Formation.For instance, at the type locality of the two species, the hillside withthe bladderpod and twinpod is formed by strata of the Uinta Formation onthe top and the base with the Thirteen Mile Creek Tongue of the Green RiverFormation on the slope (where most of the mustards grow at this site).Along Yellow Creek, the Dudley Bluffs bladderpod and twinpod grow primarilyon outcrops of the Uinta Formation, whereas at Calamity Ridge the twinpodgrows on outcrops of the Parachute Creek Member of the Green River Formation.Elevational ranges for these species are 1860-2010 meters (6140-6644 feet)for <T3>L. congesta </T3>and 1806-2255 meters (5960-7440 feet) for <T3>P. obcordata</T3>.In 1986 the Colorado National Areas Program conducted field work on <T3>P. obcordata </T3>to determine its rarity and range (Colorado NaturalAreas Program 1987). Sites of <T3>L. congesta </T3>were delineated at the same time. During this survey,populations of both species were found for the first time along YellowCreek, the next drainage west of Piceance Creek and about 5 miles away.The largest known populations of both species, approximately 10,000 individualseach, were discovered growing together at the junction of Piceance Creekand Ryan Gulch, 2 miles north of Dudley Bluffs. Also mapped were the previouslydiscovered sites of <T3>P. obcordata </T3>at Calamity Ridge, the western boundary of the PiceanceBasin and approximately 15 miles west of Piceance Creek. These sites differfrom those along Piceance and Yellow Creeks by occurring along ridges atthe heads of two drainages and on a different stratum. No <T3>L. congesta </T3>was found at Calamity Ridge. All major drainages inthe Piceance Basin were surveyed, and these two species were found onlyalong Piceance and Yellow Creeks and the twinpod at Calamity Ridge.<T3>L. congesta </T3>has five populations on approximately 50 total acresover a range of 10 miles. <T3>P. obcordata, </T3>which occurs on outcrops farther upstream on PiceanceCreek and downstream on Yellow Creek, has a range of 15 miles, plus thetwo populations on Calamity Ridge, with a total of five populations onapproximately 250 acres. However, the Dudley Bluffs and Ryan Gulch sites,which are only 2 miles apart, contain a majority of both species.The Dudley Bluffs bladderpod and twinpod occur mostly on land administeredby the Bureau, with the exception of portions of the Dudley Bluffs siteon private land and a portion of the Yellow Creek sites on Colorado Divisionof Wildlife land. The Bureau has designated the Federal portions of theDudley Bluffs site and one of the Calamity Ridge sites as Areas of CriticalEnvironmental Concern (Bureau of Land Management 1987a).<T3>L. congesta </T3>and <T3>P. obcordata </T3>grow either on outcrops of the oil shale bearingGreen River Formation or the overlying Uinta Formation, which is consideredoverburden to the oil shale. Except for the Calamity Ridge sites, all theoccurrences are within the multimineral oil shale area. This area at thecenter of the Piceance Basin contains thick, rich sections of oil shalein the mahogany zone (and thick overburden of the Uinta Formation) andalso, in the underlying saline zone, the sodium minerals nahcolite (sodiumbicarbonate) and dawsonite (a potential source of alumina). <T3>L. congesta </T3>and <T3>P. obcordata </T3>are vulnerable to impacts resulting from the developmentand extraction of these oil shale minerals and associated activities.Federal action involving these species began on September 27, 1985, whenthe Service published a notice of review in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(45 FR 39526) covering plants being consideredfor classification as endangered or threatened. <T3>L. congesta </T3>and <T3>P. obcordata </T3>were included in this notice as category 2 species.Unfortunately, <T3>L. congesta </T3>was erroneously listed as <T3>L. condensata, </T3>a common species. Category 2 comprises taxa forwhich information now in possession of the Service indicates that proposingto list them as endangered or threatened species is possibly appropriate,but for which substantial data on biological vulnerability and threatsare not currently known or on file. The present proposal is based on morecurrent biological data from the Colorado Natural Areas Program (1987).Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act), as amended in 1982,requires the Secretary of the Interior to make findings on certain petitionswithin 1 year of their receipt. All taxa contained in the 1985 notice,including <T3>L. congesta </T3>and <T3>P. obcordata, </T3>were treated as being petitioned on October 11,1985. In October 1986, October 1987, and October 1988, the Service madethe 12-month finding that the petition to list <T3>L. congesta </T3>and <T3>P. obcordata </T3>was warranted, but precluded by other listing actionsof higher priority. The present proposal constitutes the final 1-year findingrequirement of section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act for this species.<ITAG tagnum="85">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding speciesto the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered orthreatened species due to one or more of the five factors described insection 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to <T3>Lesquerella congesta </T3>Rollins (Dudley Bluffs bladderpod) and <T3>Physaria obcordata </T3>Rollins (Dudley Bluffs twinpod) are as follows:A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range. </T3>Portions of the multimineral oil shale area,including Dudley Bluffs, Ryan Gulch, and Yellow Creek, overlay oil shaledeposits that are potentially recoverable by open-pit mining (Bureau ofLand Management 1984). The rest of the area is suitable for undergroundmining of oil shale. A pilot project for a nahcolite solution mine hasbeen constructed on Bar D Mesa between Piceance Creek, Yellow Creek, andRyan Gulch, and a 120,000 tons per year commercial mine, including evaporationpounds and a pipeline, has been proposed which would cover 254 acres (Bureauof Land Management 1986; Bureau of Land Management 1987b). Currently, theBureau is reserving the multimineral area from commercial leasing untilimproved multimineral recovery technology is developed. However, leasesfor noncommercial research tracts not exceeding 2,000 acres will stillbe considered (Bureau of Land Management 1986; Bureau of Land Management1987a). Because of the massive scale of potential development in the limitedarea in which <T3>L. congesta </T3>and <T3>P. obcordata </T3>occur, a significant portion of the habitat of thesetwo wild mustards would be destroyed and/or modified and their range possiblycurtailed if development occurs. Up to 100 and 72 percent of the acreageson which <T3>L. congesta </T3>and <T3>P. obcordata </T3>occur, respectively, could be developed. There isalready a designated linear utility corridor for pipelines, transmissionlines, and roads along Ryan Gulch (Bureau of Land Management 1987a), andpotential corridors exist along Dudley Gulch, Piceance Creek, and YellowCreek (Bureau of Land Management 1984). One of the Calamity Ridge siteshas been bisected by a road (Colorado Natural Areas Program 1987).B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes. </T3>No detrimental uses of these plants are known.C. <T3>Disease or predation. </T3>No threats are known.D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. </T3>There are noFederal or State laws protecting <T3>L. congesta </T3>and <T3>P. obcordata </T3>on Federal, State, or private lands. The Bureau'sdesignation of one area each at Dudley Bluffs and Calamity Ridge as Areasof Critical Environmental Concern provides for priority management of <T3>L. congesta </T3>and <T3>P. obcordata) </T3>at these sites. However, these areas only protectabout 20 percent of the already limited habitat (about 50 acres for <T3>L. congesta </T3>and 250 acres for <T3>P. obcordata </T3>for these two species. The Act would provide additionalprotection and encourage active management through the ``Available ConservationMeasures'' discussed below.E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>These species' pattern of rarity, being locally abundant on smallareas of specialized habitat, makes them particularly vulnerable to surfacedisturbances despite their high densities.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thesespecies in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Lesquerella congesta</T3> and <T3>Physaria obcordata</T3> as threatened. These species are restrictedendemics with threats from oil shale development which could cause thetwo species to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughoutall or a significant portion of their range; thus they are threatened speciesas defined by the Act. The Bureau has designated two of the areas as Areasof Critical Environmental Concern, which will provide for priority management,but neither species is currently protected by any State or Federal legislation.For reasons given below, it is not considered prudent to propose designationof critical habitat.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat</ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a specieswhich is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. The designation of critical habitat isnot considered to be prudent when such designation would not be of netbenefit to the species. The Service finds that designation of criticalhabitat is not prudent for these species at this time because no additionalbenefits would be provided by the critical habitat designation that wouldnot already be provided by listing under 50 CFR 424.12. Any impacts tothe plants' habitat also would affect the plants as rooted organisms and,consequently, would be addressed through consultation under section 7 ofthe Act as a result of their listing. Protection of these species' habitatalso will be addressed through the recovery process. The Bureau is awareof the occurrences on their land and of its obligation under section 7of the Act. The designation of critical habitat for these species wouldnot increase the Bureau's obligation under the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingare discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requiresFederal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action thatis likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species orresult in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy oradversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may adverselyaffect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into consultation with the Service.<T3>L. congesta </T3>and <T3>P. obcordata </T3>occur primarily on Federal land administered by theBureau. The Bureau's involvement could include Section 7 consultation onmultimineral development and land exchanges with energy companies to bringthe privately owned sites into Federal ownership and protection (sincelisted plants are not protected on private land). On both Federal and privateland, the Service expects that listing would elevate the awareness of theseplants' status and foster efforts aimed toward their conservation.The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.71 and 17.72set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptions that applyto all threatened plants. All trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) ofthe Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.71, would apply. These prohibitions,in part, would make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdictionof the United States to import or export, transport in interstate or foreigncommerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for salethis species in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduceto possession the species from areas under Federal jurisdiction. Seedsfrom cultivated specimens are exempt from these prohibitions provided thata statement of ``cultivated origin'' appears on their containers. Certainexceptions can apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.The Act and 50 CFR 17.72 also provide for the issuance of permits to carryout otherwise prohibited activities involving threatened species undercertain circumstances. With regard to <T3>L. congesta </T3>and <T3>P. obcordata, </T3>it is anticipated that few, if any, trade permitswould ever be sought or issued since these species are not common in cultivationor in the wild. Requests for copies of the regulations on plants and inquiriesregarding them may be addressed to the Office of Management Authority,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 27329, Washington, DC 20038-7329(202/343-4955).<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited</ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, any commentsor suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies,the scientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningany aspect of this proposal are hereby solicited. Comments particularlyare sought concerning:(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to <T3>Lesquerella congesta </T3>and <T3>Physaria obcordata</T3>;(2) The location of any additional populations of these species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by Section 4 of the Act;(3) Additional information concerning the range and distribution of thesespecies; and(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts on these species.Final promulgation of the regulation on <T3>Lesquerella congesta </T3>and <T3>Physaria obcordata </T3>will take into consideration the comments andany additional information received by the Service, and such communicationsmay lead to adoption of a final regulation that differs from this proposal.The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal,if requested. Requests must be filed within 45 days of the date of theproposal. Such requests must be made in writing and addressed to the StateSupervisor, Fish and Wildlife Enhancement, Grand Junction, Colorado (see<T2>ADDRESSES</T2> above).<ITAG tagnum="85">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe Federal Register on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).<ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Bureau of Land Management. 1984.
