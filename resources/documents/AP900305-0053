Yeltsin easily won hiscontest but dozens of other local and regional races were headedfor runoffs after old guard Communists in the Slavic heartlandfaced their first challenges at the polls, early returns indicatedtoday.   Sunday's balloting _ the first contested local elections for theRussian, Ukranian and Byelorussian republics, was seen as a keytest of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts to transformSoviet politics.   While the vote was only partially democratic, pro-democracycandidates were expected to unseat many long-entrenched Communists.   In the Baltic republic of Lithuania, pro-independence activistssaid results in runoff elections Sunday assured them of the quorumthey need to covene the republic's parliament, where activists areexpected to push for creating a mechanism to secede from the SovietUnion.   Nearly 150 million voters were registered to choose among morethan 11,000 candidates for 1,800 seats in the legislatures ofRussia, the Ukraine and Byelorussia. Thousands of seats in localgoverning councils were contested.   Official results were not expected to be announced untilTuesday, election officials said, but preliminary results showedthat runoff elections will have to be held in dozens of districtswhere none of the candidates won a majority of the votes. Theballoting is expected in two weeks.   Yeltsin easily won a Russian parliamentary seat with 72 percentof the vote in his home district in the Ural Mountain city ofSverdlovsk, Anatoly Moisyev, a member of the republic's electioncommission, said today.   Yeltsin hopes to be elected president of the Russian republic bylegislators. That post is currently held by Politburo member VitalyVorotnikov, who also won a seat Sunday with a majority of 71.3percent.   The Russian presidency traditionally merits a seat on thenation's ruling Politburo, and Yeltsin could possibly return to theruling body from which he was ousted by Gorbachev in February 1988for criticizing the pace of reform.   In the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, preliminary results showedthat Communist Party First Secretary Vladimir A. Ivashko, a memberof the Politburo seen as a Gorbachev protege, failed to win amajority over 11 opponents and will have to stand again in a runoffelection.   Although Communist leaders have at Gorbachev's urging endorsed amultiparty system, non-Communist parties are not yet permitted.``Opposition'' candidates ran Sunday as members of grass-rootscitizens' groups or as reformist Communists.   ``Our elections involve a new type of people, people who havebeen given new impetus from perestroika,'' a relaxed, confidentGorbachev said after voting. ``The essence of it is that it is apeople's referendum on perestroika.''   ``Perestroika'' is Gorbachev's name for his program ofrestructuring Soviet politics and the economy so the system is moredemocratic and the bureaucracy that has strangled the economy isdismantled.   In the Slavic republics, reforms _ where they have managed toget started _ have proceeded more slowly and quietly than in otherareas. There have been neither the concerted drives of the Balticrepublics nor the violence of the Caucasus and Central Asia.   In the Ukraine's Donetsk coal basin, however, miners went onstrike Friday demanding resignation of the local Communist Partyleadership and complaining that promises made after coal strikes inthe region last summer were not implemented quickly enough.   Gorbachev has pressed the Communist Party to relinquish itsmonopoly on power and pushed for a new, more powerful presidency.Hundreds of thousands of people have turned out for pro-democracyrallies.   Responding to reporters' questions after he voted in LeninHills, the Soviet leader said it was not particularly importantwhether the victors in Sunday's elections were Communists.   The 20-million member party is trying to get much closer to thepeople, ``and so the question of proportions is not crucial,'' hesaid. ``It is important that people are there who supportperestroika and are prepared to move this process ahead. Communistor non-party members, all will be good enough.''   Voters in the Ukraine selected a 450-member Supreme Sovietlegislature, Byelorussia chose a 310-member legislature and Russiaelected a 1,068-member congress that will choose a legislature andleadership from among its members.   The balloting in the Slavic republics follows local elections inLithuania swept by candidates endorsed by the pro-independenceSajudis movement, and several other republics.   Voters in 28 Lithuanian districts cast ballots in runoffelections Sunday. Runoffs in the remaining 17 districts not settledin the Feb. 24 election will be held later in the week, theofficial Tass news agency said.   On Sunday, at least nine deputies to the Lithuanian SupremeSoviet were elected, eight of them supported by thepro-independence movement Sajudis, said Longinas Vasiliauskas, aSajudis spokesman. Two-thirds of the 140-member parliament musthave been elected before a session can be called.   Observers have speculated that Sajudis wants a quick parliamentsession so Lithuania can vote to secede from the Soviet Unionbefore Gorbachev gains his expected broad new powers, which includethe right to suspend republic parliaments and send in troops.   The Soviet Congress meets in one week to consider Gorbachev'sproposal.   Vasiliauskas said the Lithuanian parliament would not vote toleave the Soviet Union immediately but wants to create themechanism for secession because ``We don't know what Gorbachev willdo after he's elected president.''</TEXT></DOC>
