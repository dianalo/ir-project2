Five of the six currently traded delivery months, from October 1988 to October 1989, representing the 1988-89 crop season that begins Aug. 1, rose their permissible limit. The exception was the March 1989 contract, which advanced 1.95 cents a pound to its high of the day, 62.10 cents a pound. The most heavily traded contract was that for December 1988, which settled at 61.67 cents. The nearest delivery, July 1988, which represents the 1987-88 crop, advanced 1.46 cents to 66.61 cents.    According to Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York, dry weather in the Delta portion of the Mississippi Valley, from Arkansas to Louisiana, prompted demand for contracts. For example, Mr. Simon said, &quot;Greenwood, Miss., a major cotton center, has only had 50% of its normal rainfall since the beginning of this month.&quot;    Peter Leavitt, vice president of Weather Services Corp., Bedford, Mass., said the Mississippi Delta and, in particular, its central and south central areas, have had about half the normal precipitation at this time of the year. The extreme northern and southern sections of the area have a shortfall of about 80% of normal rainfall, he said.    &quot;The dryness has accelerated in recent weeks,&quot; Mr. Leavitt said. &quot;So far this month, Mississippi and eastern Arkansas have had only about one-quarter inch of rain. Normally, rainfall at this time of the year is about five inches,&quot; he said.    Mr. Leavitt said the dry spell has come just as farmers are trying to plant the 1988-89 cotton crop.    &quot;The shortage of topsoil moisture is delaying planting because the seeds need the moisture in order to germinate,&quot; Mr. Leavitt said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   PRECIOUS METALS: Platinum and gold futures prices advanced on the possibility that a high U.S. trade deficit figure might be issued today and because gains in other futures fed inflation fears. Silver prices lagged and ended slightly easier. July delivery platinum rose $5.50 an ounce to $555.80, while June gold was up $2.30 an ounce to $456. July silver ended down five cents an ounce to $6.65. Silver didn't join the upswing because demand for the metal itself has been lagging, an analyst said. According to another analyst, estimates that the March trade deficit will range up to $13 billion or higher prompted demand for gold and platinum contracts. A surge in soybeans and a rise in the Commodity Research Bureau's index to the highest level in three years also provided support. A major early boost for platinum came from London, where Johnson Matthey PLC, the world's largest manufacturer and supplier of precious metals, estimated that platinum production last year fell 220,000 ounces short of consumption, due to a 63% rise in Japanese buying to 1.65 million ounces. Concerns about strong U.S. sanctions against South Africa and possible counteractions by that nation continued to give the platinum market strength, an analyst said.    COPPER: Futures prices eased, running counter to other inflation-fueled markets, as visible supplies of copper increased. July delivery copper declined 2.15 cents a pound to 94.30 cents, just 0.05 cent above the low of the day. The market was softer throughout the session, except for a short-lived rally that was prompted by inflation concerns, according to one analyst. Investors and traders appeared to focus more on the bigger inventories in warehouses of the London Metal Exchange (up 3,775 tons last week to 45,200 tons) and in Comex storage (up 351 tons from Thursday to 9,563 tons), the analyst said. U.S. traders didn't seem concerned about trading patterns in the London market yesterday. There, copper for delivery three months hence closed with little change after recovering from an early decline. But the cash, or spot, position commanded a strong premium over the three-month delivery. Wide fluctions in the premium prompted the London exchange to issue a statement describing the market as orderly despite the extreme &quot;backwardation,&quot; or premium of cash over threemonth delivery. John Wolff, acting chairman of the LME said, &quot;Perhaps it had not been generally realized just how tight nearby supplies of copper are.&quot;    FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Prices drifted lower as most futures traders sat on the sidelines or evened up their accounts in anticipation of this morning's release of March merchandise trade figures. A robust rise in the nation's shipments likely pared the trade deficit to $12.6 billion in March from $13.8 billion in February, according to a Dow Jones Capital Markets Report poll of economists. Reports that the Bank of England sold modest amounts of pounds also added to the downward pressure on currencies, traders said. The British central bank reportedly stepped in to cool the pound's rise when it rose above 3.19 West German marks. The pound now stands at 3.1865 to 3.1892 marks. Many traders say it may hit 3.20 marks shortly. </TEXT></DOC>
