Altogether 47 J/sup {pi}/ =1/sup +/ states have been determined. The summed M1 strength is {Sigma}B(M1)arrowup = 16.9/sub -3.3//sup +4.6/{mu}/sub N//sup 2/. A shell model calculationincluding 1p-1h excitations is studied to discuss the fragmentation,the summed strength and the relative importance of spin versus orbitalmagnetism. By comparison with inelastic proton scattering and chargeexchange reactions the isospin structure of the M1 strength distributionis analysed.</TEXT></DOC>
