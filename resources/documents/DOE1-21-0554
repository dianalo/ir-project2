There were no correlations between the results of computertomography and phlebography or between computer tomography and laboratorytests. In 31 patients (20%) a correct diagnosis was obtained and thesepatients were sent to surgery. Four cases (3%) were shown to be falsepositive. In these cases (with one exception), both the computer tomographyand phlebography results had been overinterpreted. Computer tomographywas shown to be a method of high sensitivity and almost as great specificity.Tumors cannot be distinguished by phlebography; only pheochromocytomashows a characteristic alteration of vessels in arteriograms. In general,an accurate diagnosis requires positive angiography (arterio- or phlebography)results and clear evidence of elevated hormone levels. Only then is surgeryindicated.</TEXT></DOC>
