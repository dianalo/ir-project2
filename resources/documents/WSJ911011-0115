First the House check-kitingscandal and now the degradation of the Senate confirmationprocess has surely driven popular support for term limits toeven higher levels. Now the California Supreme Court hasburied many of the specious legal and political argumentsagainst the idea. Yesterday, in a 6-to-1 vote, it ruled thatvoters could enact strict term limits for elected officials.The era of the career politician in California -- and perhapseventually in many other states -- is ending.   The decision means that every current member of the stateAssembly must leave office by 1996. All state senators, alongwith the governor and other statewide officials, can serveonly two four-year terms. The court ruled on a suit broughtby -- who else? -- state legislators, who argued thatProposition 140, the term-limit law passed by voters lastyear, unfairly restricted a legislator's right to run foroffice and a voter's right to choose a candidate.</LP><TEXT>   The court noted that term limits have long applied to thepresidency and half the nation's governors. Extending termlimits to legislators was fully justified by the public'sinterest in &quot;protecting against an entrenched, dynasticlegislative bureaucracy,&quot; wrote Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas.   As for being undemocratic, the court sympathized with themajority of voters who felt that installing an electoralparking meter for legislators would encourage the best onesto get on with the job and dispose of the worst before theybecame entrenched. &quot;The best people can still serve alifetime in public office,&quot; says Lew Uhler, co-author ofProp. 140. &quot;They just have to win promotion by climbing thecareer ladder to a higher office.&quot;   Legislators and other political insiders aren't taking thenews well. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said he couldn'tbelieve the court's decision. Ken Maddy, the State Senate'sGOP leader, said his Republican colleagues were &quot;appalled.&quot;Contrary to the claims that lobbyists and legislativestaffers would gain power from term limits, both groups werein mourning yesterday in Sacramento. The court upheld Prop.140's cuts in the legislature's budget; more than 640staffers have left their jobs since January.   As for special interests, their attitude was summed uplast year by Linda Muir, a horse-racing lobbyist: &quot;The ideaof an entire group of new members every six years, with nofamiliarity with the issue or the history of our industry, isvery frightening. It scares the heck out of me.&quot;   Legislators say the ruling will be appealed to the U.S.Supreme Court, which also will ultimately have to rule onwhether or not states can limit the terms of their owncongressional delegations. (Prop. 140 didn't go that far.)Despite propaganda to the contrary, many legal scholarsbelieve such state limits may be constitutional. But beforethe courts rule, it makes sense for states to pass suchlimits; voters in Washington state will decide on the issuenext month, and it will be on some 15 state ballots nextyear.   The lone dissenting vote against term limits was cast byJustice Stanley Mosk. He challenged the right of voters tocreate &quot;a legislature of `citizens' in place of one of`politicians.'&quot; He concluded that &quot;The initiative process isout of control in California.&quot; He is wrong. The state'sresidents have simply taken back control of their governmentand reminded the politicians of who ultimately is responsiblefor the health of a democracy: the people themselves.</TEXT></DOC>
