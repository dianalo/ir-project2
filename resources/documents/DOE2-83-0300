This observedincrease of {sup 238}U can be explained as due to the fallout of naturaluranium from the eruption of Mount St. Helens. Large increases in theconcentration of thorium isotopes detected in rain and snow samples duringthe last months of 1982 and early months of 1983 probably originatedfrom the eruption of El Chichon volcano, which occurred on 28 March 1982.About 450 Ci of {sup 232}Th is estimated to have been injected into theatmosphere by this eruption. Isotopic anomalies were observed in atmosphericsamples such as rain and snow. These anomalies can be attributed to variousnatural as well as man-made sources: nuclear weapon tests, nuclear accidentsinvolving the burn-up of nuclear powered satellites, and volcanic eruptions.The variation of {sup 234}U/{sup 238}U ratios in radioactive mineralswhen leached with nitric acid were also noticed and this variation, while{sup 235}U/{sup 238}U remained fairly constant, can be explained in termsof the {alpha}-recoil effect and changes in oxidation state of uranium.Difference found in {sup 239}Pu/{sup 238}U ratios in terrestrial samplesand uranium minerals can be explained as due to fallout contamination.</TEXT></DOC>
