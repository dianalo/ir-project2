Tuesday evening, the property-casualty insurer surprised many by reporting a big second-quarter loss of $115.5 million. The loss reflected Fireman's decision to increase reserves for future claims by $476 million in the quarter, mainly because of health and general liability business written before Mr. Byrne's arrival at the company in 1985.    Mr. Byrne said Tuesday that Fireman's had taken &quot;a fresh look&quot; at its reserves and found them wanting. &quot;We faced a major pothole and filled it,&quot; he said. But Mr. Byrne has used the pothole metaphor before to describe problems inherited from his predecessors -- usually to indicate the problems had already been solved.    Fireman's made two big &quot;one-time&quot; additions to reserves in 1983 and 1985, because of older business on the books. Those charges came when the company was still 100%-owned by American Express; it's currently 27%-owned by the financial service giant. The latest reserve addition brings the total to more than $1 billion, according to Gerald Lewinsohn, a Merrill Lynch analyst.    Mr. Byrne said yesterday, &quot;My credibility has been shredded, I know that.&quot; However, he adds, &quot;I hope that in five years' time, people will look back and say I did the right thing.&quot;    Analysts say health insurance claims often are a source of embarrassment to insurers, requiring supplementary reserves. Particularly problematic are claims related to diseases such as asbestosis, which take decades to show up. Fireman's says $300 million of its second-quarter addition to reserves relates to business written before 1984. Of that, about 50% consists of reserves for health claims related to diseases caused by asbestos, hazardous wastes and the like.    After an initial gasp, money managers seemed to conclude that Mr. Byrne should get credit for acting wisely. Fireman's stock dipped more than a point yesterday morning, but narrowed its loss to close at 34 3/8, off 3/8 on 617,000 shares.    Tom Mitchell of Weiss Peck andamp; Greer, a Fireman's holder, thinks Mr. Byrne's move puts Fireman's in a position to withstand any &quot;irresponsible&quot; price-cutting by insurers. With a stronger balance sheet, Fireman's can try to gain a bigger share of the more profitable insurance lines, he says.    The latest reserve addition puts the insurer's net worth at $1.7 billion, up $179 million since January. Mr. Mitchell says the reserve addition could cut Fireman's reported profit in 1987 in half, to about $2 a share, excluding investment gains. But he says that's &quot;irrelevant.&quot;    Fireman's real earnings power is $4 or $5 a share, Mr. Mitchell asserts. He contends that the stock could sell in the low 50s when the industry returns to favor.    Michael Holland of First Boston Asset Management believes it would be a mistake to bet against Mr. Byrne and his managers. &quot;They're as good a team of professionals as there is in the business,&quot; he says.    Money managers have had high hopes for Fireman's since the arrival of Mr. Byrne and William McCormick, his lieutenant who runs day-to-day insurance operations. Mr. Byrne turned around Geico in the 1970s. His fans think he will transform Fireman's from a middle-rank company into a top-tier insurer.    But Ernie Jacob, a Drexel Burnham analyst, believes investors &quot;have been paying a little too much for the glamor of Mr. Byrne.&quot; Fireman's is &quot;an average insurance company that made mistakes in the early 1980s,&quot; he says. &quot;It takes a good bit to turn around a big insurer.&quot;    Fireman's says one motive for its health-related reserve addition was a recent California court ruling that amplified insurers' liabilities for asbestos-related claims. Roughly 50% of its special $300 million reserve is attributable to &quot;poor-quality&quot; general liability and auto insurance, the company says.    John Neff of Wellington Management says other insurers, such as Travelers, have consistently buttressed reserves for health claims in the past two years. Some analysts think other insurers will follow Fireman's move, as banks followed Citicorp recently when it buttressed reserves. But Mr. Neff says Fireman's seems to be playing catch-up with big, multiline insurers.    Mr. Byrne appears disenchanted with insurance. &quot;It's a mediocre business,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't know why anybody puts capital&quot; into writing insurance. Asked whether line managers should have anticipated the need for bigger reserves, he says: &quot;I don't want anyone to think I'm displeased about the current operations.&quot;    ---   Fireman's Fund   (NYSE; Symbol: FFC)   Business: Property-casualty insurer    Year ended Dec. 31, 1986:*   Net income: $228.5 million; $3.45 a share    Second quarter, June 30, 1987:**    Net Loss: $115.5 million vs profit of $55 million; 83cents a share   Average daily trading volume: 159,666 shares    Common shares outstanding: 64.8 million    *Includes $72.9 million capital gain    **Includes second-quarter reserve additions of $476million and capital gains of $43.4 million.
