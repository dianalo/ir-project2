White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush learnedtoday that Fang and his wife were barred the banquet Sunday night,and that he ``expressed regret'' to Vice Premier Wu Xueqian beforeflying to Seoul, South Korea.   Fitzwater said it is the president's view that such problems ashuman rights should be dealt with in a low-key and private manner.   The 53-year-old Fang, China's most famous dissident, is also aninternationally respected astrophysicist. He maintains that Marxismis a failure in China and that a multiparty system is needed toguarantee basic human rights.   The U.S. Embassy said Ambassador Winston Lord met today withForeign Ministry officials to discuss the incident. Details of themeeting were not immediately available.   Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, were traveling with an Americancouple to the banquet when police stopped their car a few blocksfrom the hotel where the banquet was held and accused the driver ofspeeding. Police prevented them from walking to the hotel, thenhalted a taxi to which they had transferred and ordered a bus not topick them up.   They insisted Fang and Li were not on the guest list, althoughthe official U.S. list bore their names. Police then tailed the fourfor 90 minutes as they walked to Lord's residence to seek help.   Fang told about two dozen reporters jammed into his tinyapartment today that he was ``a little bit afraid'' Sunday nightbecause of the many police.   But he added, ``I can't change my views because of fear. We needfreedom and human rights.''   ``I was very angry,'' said his wife. ``I'm not particularlyafraid. It was crazy, stupid.''   Bush did not raise human rights issues during his two days ofmeetings with Chinese leaders. However, senior leader Deng Xiaopingand Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang both stressed thatdomestic stability is more important now than democratic reform.Zhao warned in unusually strong language that any American supportfor China's dissidents would harm the bilateral relationship.   Fang was careful not to criticize Bush, saying, ``It's too earlyfor me to evaluate him.''   But he said, ``I hope they (the Americans) say something more inthe next few days.   ``Regarding the United States, I have a principled criticism: Iwant it to adopt a single standard toward human rights and not adouble standard,'' he said. ``I think there are indeed some doublestandards'' in the United States' open criticism of the SovietUnion's human rights record but not China's.   But he added, ``Of course, we Chinese must win our own humanrights for ourselves.''   Fang, who is popular among Chinese students, said he did not wantthe police action against him to trigger student demonstrations. Buthe said he also does not expect the police action to silencegovernment critics.   ``I have received many phone calls from friends. They assured methey support me and they were very angry with the government,'' Fangsaid. ``One friend said a couple of days ago that we should bequiet, not speak so much. Today he called and said we should speakmore.''   Several other government critics attended the Bush banquetwithout interference. But none is as well-known outside China asFang, who stepped into the political limelight in 1986 with eloquentspeeches to college students calling for democracy and human rights.   Authorities blamed him for a nationwide wave of studentdemonstrations in the winter of 1986-87 and expelled him from theruling Communist Party. Recently, they refused him permission to goto the United States to attend a scientific conference and teach.   Fang recently sent an open letter to senior leader Deng callingfor an amnesty for political prisoners, and the call was taken up byseveral dozen other leading writers and thinkers who sent a secondletter.</TEXT></DOC>
