NatWest took the lead among British banks in following many U.S. banks, which in the past several weeks have substantially raised their reserves for troubled Third World loans. In New York, Manufacturers Hanover Corp. and Bankers Trust New York Corp., as expected, announced increases in their reserves. Manufacturers added $1.7 billion and Bankers Trust $700 million, continuing the American pattern on Third World loss reserves that was set by Citicorp last month.    The addition will raise the National Westminster's total loan-loss reserve to #828 million, or 29.8% of its #2.8 billion ($4.56 billion) in loans outstanding to 35 less-developed countries, up from 13% previously. However, NatWest said it expects to maintain a normal dividend and to report lower but &quot;positive retained profits&quot; for this year's first half.    Analysts in London predicted the three other major British banking companies -- Lloyds Bank PLC, Barclays PLC and Midland Bank PLC -- also would boost their reserves substantially, but perhaps not as aggressively as NatWest did. Yesterday, those banks said they wouldn't decide about further loan-loss provisions until shortly before releasing their first-half results late next month.    Shares of all four big banks registered early gains on the London Stock Exchange yesterday in anticipation of such extra reserves. By late in the day, NatWest had posted the largest single advance, climbing 50 pence to 753 pence ($12.27) a share. In other late trading, Barclays rose 27 pence to 604 pence and Lloyds increased 20 pence to 598. But Midland Bank PLC's slight gain evaporated, and it slid eight pence to 620 by late yesterday.    NatWest said its problem loans include #483 million to Brazil, #574 million to Mexico, #938 million elsewhere in Latin America and #780 million in the remaining countries.    The bank also said its capital position and key regulatory ratios would remain &quot;satisfactory,&quot; despite the increased loan-loss reserve. The Bank of England, the nation's central bank, sets minimum risk-asset ratios on loans for commercial banks here, and banks usually don't disclose those figures.    NatWest decided to raise such reserves because of &quot;changed perceptions about the level&quot; of necessary provisions and similar moves by a number of U.S. banks since mid-May, said John Burns, the bank's chief financial officer. The bank's board approved the decision last week, he said.    &quot;We felt the time was right to end lingering doubts. And once the commercial decision was made, we decided to release it,&quot; Mr. Burns said. Waiting for the July 28 release of the bank's first-half report &quot;is a long time in stock markets.&quot; He added that NatWest consulted with the Bank of England, but he emphasized that the central bank &quot;hadn't issued any edict.&quot;    The Bank of England yesterday said it &quot;welcomed&quot; NatWest's action and reaffirmed earlier statements encouraging British banks to increase their provisions for problem loans. But the central bank hasn't pressured banks to adopt a timetable or a specific course of action.    While forecasting sharp boosts in the other three big banks' loan-loss reserves, analysts said it isn't clear that rivals will proportionately match NatWest's increase.    &quot;NatWest was already the strongest of the Big Four&quot; British banks, said John Andrews, a director at London-based IBCA Banking Analysis Ltd., a bank-rating agency. &quot;It had the easiest time admitting it was carrying loans on its books for years at an unrealistic value, and there is an element of daring the others to follow it.&quot;    Accepting NatWest's challenge will cost its competitors plenty. Analysts agree that Midland Bank faces the most severe difficulties. The bank has a weak capital position, a high level of doubtful loans and profits that haven't recovered yet from its unsuccessful acquisition of San Francisco-based Crocker National Bank, which is now part of Wells Fargo andamp; Co. It would cost more than #1 billion ($1.63 billion) for Midland to match NatWest's reserve level on its #4.3 billion in Third World loans, according to a report by Greenwell Montagu andamp; Co., Midland's stock brokerage unit.    That #1 billion, representing almost half of Midland's equity, would cause a big 1987 loss and force the bank to raise a sizable amount of new equity capital, probably under unfavorable conditions, the report noted. &quot;It will take (Midland) two to three years, plus additional capital, to 'muddle through,'&quot; the report said.    Lloyds' extensive Latin American activities account for the bulk of its #3.2 billion ($5.22 billion) Third World debt. Greenwell Montagu estimated that Lloyds must raise its reserve by #760 million to match NatWest's action. Such a move would plunge Lloyds into a loss for this year, analysts said, but its earnings could recover strongly in 1988.    Analysts described Barclays as being in the strongest position to match NatWest. According to Greenwell Montagu, Barclays would have to raise its reserve by #640 million, representing 17% of its equity, to equal 30% of its estimated #3.2 billion in problem loans.    For Manufacturers Hanover, the reserve addition means that the fourth-largest U.S. banking company will post a $1.4 billion loss for the second quarter and expects a $1.05 billion loss for the year. The company last year earned $410 million before extraordinary credits.    Bankers Trust, the eighth largest U.S. banking company, said that it would have a second-quarter loss of $570 million and a loss of $150 million to $200 million for the year. Last year it earned $528 million.    Although Manufacturers Hanover's action hurts shareholders -- it knocked common equity to 2.3% of assets from 4.2% in the first quarter -- John F. McGillicuddy, the company's chairman, indicated in a letter to shareholders that earnings should bounce back strongly. He estimated that earnings in 1988 and 1989 would be &quot;in excess of $600 million&quot; each year, or at least 50% above last year's $410 million earnings.    Manufacturers Hanover's board declared a quarterly dividend of 82 cents a share and said dividend policy remains unchanged.    The company also said it expects to realize gains of $50 million this year and a total of $200 million to $300 million over the next few years from the sale of &quot;undervalued assets.&quot; A spokesman declined to specify what those assets might be.    Analysts and bankers have said that Manufacturers Hanover, with a $6.7 billion loan exposure to its five largest Latin American borrowers and a weaker financial position than many of its peers, might have to sell prime real estate in New York or London.    The company's total reserve will be $2.7 billion, which represents 4.9% of total loans and 22% of loans to less-developed countries.    For Bankers Trust, the addition boosts its reserve to $1.3 billion. That represents 4.9% of its total loans and 25% of the $4 billion owed by countries refinancing their debt.    A bank spokesman said the action leaves its current dividend untouched. However, the action will cut stockholders' equity between 8% and 10% by year end.    Bankers Trust's ability to use the tax benefits resulting from the reserve action will be limited this year to about $60 million to $70 million; the balance will be carried forward.    Moody's Investors Service Inc. confirmed its debt ratings for Manufacturers Hanover and Bankers Trust. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Manufacturers shares closed yesterday at $45, up 12.5 cents, and Bankers Trust shares closed at $53.75, down 50 cents.    In Chicago, Northern Trust Corp. added $85 million to its reserve for Third World loans, raising the total reserve to $163 million. The addition will result in estimated losses of $63 million for the second quarter and $18 million for the year. Northern Trust earned about $52.3 million last year. </TEXT></DOC>
