The biotechnology company said its patent covers &quot;all erythropoietin products currently undergoing clinical trials&quot; -- including those being tested by a competitor, Amgen Inc., of Thousand Oaks, Calif.    In heavy national over-the-counter trading, Amgen shares fell sharply, closing at $31.75, down $6.50. Genetics Institute shares jumped $4.75, to $36.25.    Though the patent decision is a big boost to Genetics Institute, it doesn't necessarily end the contest between the companies. Both companies have patent applications pending covering a process for making genetically engineered erythropoietin. The companies employ different processes.    Amgen didn't return phone calls for comment on the patent.    Erythropoietin, or EPO, is used to fight anemia in persons with kidney disease by boosting their natural production of red blood cells, reducing their need for blood transfusions. Genetics Institute said it believes the drug may also be effective in countering anemia produced by certain drugs used to fight cancer or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS.    Kathy Behrens, an analyst with Robertson, Colman andamp; Stephens in San Francisco, estimates the world-wide market for EPO in people with kidney disease at $250 million a year. &quot;Amgen clearly has a significant lead on the clinical trials of this product. It's perhaps a year, some say two, ahead,&quot; she said. &quot;Investors had discounted the role that Genetics Institute might play.&quot;    Now the awarding of the patent changes that. &quot;At worst case for Genetics Institute, they've leveraged themselves into a good position in erythropoietin,&quot; Ms. Behrens said. &quot;At best, they have a totally protectable product patent that would exclude everybody. There's a lot of territory in between,&quot; she added.    But analysts said that if Amgen wins a patent on its process for making genetically engineered EPO and Genetics doesn't, then Genetics' position may not be as strong as it currently appears.    Linda Miller, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said: &quot;Having a patent on a pure form of the molecule (as Genetics Institute does) doesn't mean that you have a commercial product. If Amgen does get a patent on the commercial process for producing this thing, you've got a standoff.&quot; In similar cases, some other biotechnology companies have cross-licensed each other's patents. In other cases, the patent disputes have ended up in court, she said.    Summarizing Genetics Institute's view, Bruce M. Eisen, vice president and chief patent counsel, said: &quot;Amgen needs us. We may or may not need Amgen.&quot;    Genetics has licensed U.S. and Japanese rights to EPO to Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. of Japan and European rights to Boehringer Mannheim G.m.b.H. of West Germany. Both are conducting clinical tests overseas. Genetics said it has developed a pure form of EPO that is safer and more potent than other versions developed by others.    Amgen has granted certain rights to its product to Johnson andamp; Johnson. In New Brunswick, N.J., a spokesman for the drug company said it didn't have any comment on the Genetics Institute patent. </TEXT></DOC>
