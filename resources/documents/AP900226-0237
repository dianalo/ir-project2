Dallas-based MCorp said specifics of the deal would be set forthin filings with the federal bankruptcy court, which must approvethe sale along with bank regulators. The sale is expected to becompleted before Sept. 30.   MBank-El Paso has assets of $1.1 billion and deposits totalingabout $946 million.   MBank has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings since March31, 1989. MCorp's federally assisted bailout in 1989 was the thirdlargest in history after Continental Illinois of Chicago in 1984and FirstRepublic Bank Corp. of Dallas in 1988.   MBank-El Paso has 600 employees, including those in its eightbranches in the city.   Tom Hudgins, MCorp group chairman, said the holding company alsois trying to sell its four remaining banks in Waco, New Braunfels,Corpus Christi and Brownsville.
