Israel today called for a start date of Dec. 9 instead.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ISRAEL WANTS FIVE-DAY DELAY IN NEXT ROUND OF PEACETALKS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Palestinians denounced the Israeli call for a postponement. Palestiniannegotiator Saeb Erekat called it &quot;classic example of blackmail&quot; and said theJewish state was &quot;trying to get the results of the negotiations before theybegin.&quot;;   Besides seeking a delay, Israel proposed a gap of four to five daysbetween each negotiating session, arguing that if Israel negotiatedsimultaneously with all three Arab delegations under one roof, &quot;the extremistline&quot; would predominate.;   &quot;We have reason to believe that the Arabs are notinterested in talking to us or in conducting direct negotiations with us butwant to talk with the United States and try to exert pressure through it,&quot;said the statement read by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman, EhudGol.;   Israel has expressed anger at the United States for selecting the sitewithout consulting it first. The statement said Israel was prepared to hold&quot;one or two meetings&quot; in Washington but that it wanted to continue the talksin or near the Middle East.;   Israel has called repeatedly for talks to beheld in the region, saying this would test the Arabs' willingness to recognizeits existence.;   Today's statement, however, appeared to offer a concessionby dropping earlier demands that the Washington talks stick only to proceduralissues, not the substance of the conflict.;   Also, the statement was phrasedas a series of proposals, not conditions. But it reflected Israel's contentionthat the peace process begun Oct. 30 in Madrid was deviating from theseparate, face-to-face negotiations the United States had promised Israel.;  Despite Israeli anger over U.S. handling of the invitations, BenjaminNetanyahu, a deputy minister in Shamir's office, said Israel sought the delaysimply to have more time to prepare.;   &quot;We have to organize,&quot; he said onIsrael Television. &quot;We received a short warning to prepare these negotiationswhich are so important, even fateful.&quot;;   When the invitations to the secondround of the peace talks were issued by the United States, Jordan acceptedpromptly. Lebanon gave its assent later.;   Syria and the Palestinians, thetwo key holdouts on the Arab side, edged closer Tuesday to accepting theinvitation but raised &quot;any number of questions&quot; about conditions. The StateDepartment says the Bush administration wants unqualified acceptances.;   Thecall for a postponement, which followed a meeting of the policy making DefenseCabinet, came under a hail of criticism from left-wing politicians.;   YossiSarid of the Citizens' Rights Movement called it &quot;pathetic and infantile.&quot;Fellow legislator Shulamit Aloni said it &quot;strengthened the impression that thegovernment has no desire to advance peace.&quot;;   Shimon Peres, head of theopposition Labor party, said Israel was &quot;being stubborn again, and moving inzigzags. This only hurts us.&quot;;   &quot;What is so bad with the government insistingthat there be meetings in the region? What is so bad about it? What sin isthis?&quot; Foreign Minister David Levy replied to other critics in Parliament.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Jerusalem  </CITY><EDITION>  Home  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911127  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  549  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, November 27, 199100332033,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
