Marx Jr., president of ATandamp;T NetworkSystems.andM;Marx said the company would first put the technology to work in itshigh-speed transmission systems, followed by its switching systems.andM;A prototype photonic switching device was on display in ATandamp;T's ex- hibit atSUPERCOMM '90 in Atlanta, GA.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
