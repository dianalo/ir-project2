Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final regulatory impact analysishas been or will be prepared.2. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553) includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Further, no other law requires thata notice of proposed rulemaking and opportunity for public comment be givenfor this rule. Accordingly, it is being issued in final form. However,as with other Department of Commerce rules, comments from the public arealways welcome. Written comments (six copies) should be submitted to: JoanMaguire, Regulations Branch, Export Administration, Department of Commerce,P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044. 3.
