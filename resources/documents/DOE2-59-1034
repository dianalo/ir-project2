The conventionalmethods are mercury method, carbon dioxide method, and helium method.The mercury method indicates the existence of the geothermal activityof the specific area, but indicates nothing about its time-wise situationwhether the past or the present. The carbon dioxide method and the heliummethod have difficulty in the evaluation of the gas concentration abnormalitywhen the contribution of gas from the underground is not sufficient.A newly developed method of detection is a finger print method. In thismethod, an activated coal accummulatingly collects a gas for a certainperiod to measure all the absorbed gas by a mass-analyzer, by which asimilarity with the model sample is examined by means of a multi-variatedata analysis. This method is based on the mechanism that organic carbonin the rocks thermally decomposes to generate hydrocarbons, and excelsin that the analysis is made by the patterns of the gas compositions.(7 figs, 1 tab)</TEXT></DOC>
