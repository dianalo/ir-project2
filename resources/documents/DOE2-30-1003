Therefore, for studies of trehalose accumulationit is important to assess the activities of both enzymes. In wild typeyeast the synthesizing activity predominates over the hydrolytic enzyme,which is normally found in a cryptic, inactive form, capable of beingactivated under certain physiological conditions. In an attempt to geta deeper insight into the role that trehalose plays when yeast cellsare faced with different kinds of environmental or metabolic stresses,they have constructed diploid and haploid strains which harbor specificlesions in the regulation of the enzymes involved in trehalose metabolism.Sporulation, germination, and nutrient deprivation were the major parametersanalyzed.</TEXT></DOC>
