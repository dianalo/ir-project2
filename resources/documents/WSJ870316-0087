The accord ends a three-year campaign by Washington to persuade its economic allies to cut back on the use of tied-aid credits. The U.S. has argued that unfair competition is created when government export financing is laced with foreign-aid grants to persuade foreign purchasers to buy products.    Agreement on the pact came after Japan, the last holdout in the three-year negotiations, signaled it would go along with a compromise formula that essentially follows the U.S. demands. The accord is expected to be announced today by the 24-country Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, under whose auspices it was hammered out.    Essentially, the accord seeks to discourage the use of tied aid by making it more costly for governments to offer such joint financing packages. Toward that end, the agreement first will raise the minimum aid levels required in any tied-aid package to 35%, up from 25% now.    It also will change the formula for calculating the foreign-aid component of such packages, so as to raise the cost for countries such as Japan, West Germany and the Netherlands that traditionally maintain unusually low interest rates.    The new rules will be phased in over two years beginning in July. The subsidy level will be based on a country's actual interest rates and an arbitrary 10% &quot;norm&quot; rate.    The accord also will alter existing restrictions on the use of interest subsidies in ordinary export-financing transactions. Subsidies on loans or guarantees to industrial democracies and to the Soviet Union -- now only minuscule -- will be prohibited entirely.    The subsidy ceiling on export financing for the poorest developing countries will be raised to 50% from the current 25%. And the minimum interest rate for transactions involving newly industrializing countries and low-income developing countries will be raised three-tenths of a percentage point.    Prohibiting subsidized loans to the Soviet Union has been another longstanding U.S. goal. The Reagan administration has been arguing for years that Moscow doesn't need subsidies, which were intended originally for developing countries. But until now, the European countries, which trade heavily with the Soviets, had refused to go along.    Washington had pushed hard for the new accord, at one point even asking Congress for a $300 million &quot;war chest&quot; to help match other countries' subsidies in an effort to pressure them into cutting back on using them. </TEXT></DOC>
