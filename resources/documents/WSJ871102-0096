McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (letters, Oct. 22), accused the Journal of bias in its Sept. 30 editorial favoring privatization. But his assertions much better fit the definition of bias than does the Journal's position. Mr. McEntee's inclination in the privatization debate is directly self-interested. The livelihood of public-employee-union officials depends on continuing the delivery of public services via bureaucratic monopolies.    There are no data supporting his assertion that privatization often involves service problems, collusion or the lack of competition. Virtually every quantitative study comparing service delivery by government departments with private firms finds significant cost savings when services are supplied by private contractors. There is also no systematic evidence that privatization causes unemployment or necessarily lowers the standard of living for public employees. There are cases where the salaries of public employees who move to the private sector go up and cases where salaries or benefits go down (perhaps closer to private-sector norms).    AFSCME's &quot;evidence&quot; relies mostly on a few dozen selected anecdotes about contracting-out problems that are generally the result of poorly drawn contracts or archaic contracting restrictions (e.g., limiting contracts to one year only). The Local Government Center's data base has over 28,000 examples of privatization across the country, and American cities, counties and states execute thousands -- perhaps tens of thousands -- of new contracts each year.    AFSCME's solution to what can be considered only an isolated -- and usually easily correctable -- problem is better public management. But the management incentives (and disincentives) inherent in public-service monopolies can never match those created by the competition in the marketplace.    Philip E. Fixler Jr.   Director, Local Government Center   Reason Foundation   Santa Monica, Calif.   ---   Collusion and corruption occur only because public employees fail to protect the interests of the taxpayers. After all, bureaucrats are responsible for the competitive bidding process and for monitoring contracts with the private sector. As far as the higher wages and benefits for public employees are concerned, the issue is not whether the private sector skimps but whether public employees are overpaid. Much of the cost reduction achieved by privatization is due to more efficient use of personnel and the payment of market wages rather than inflated civil-service pay scales.    As to why government agencies aren't able to provide cost-effective management: Most public services are protected from competition by legislative fiat so that the competitive pressures for cost reduction are absent. Private firms are driven out of business when they don't satisfy consumers. But taxes insulate the public agency, which doesn't have to compete in the market.    Prof. James T. Bennett   George Mason University   Fairfax, Va.   ---   Privatization is a good alternative. Mr. McEntee opposes it because it will tend to reduce the number of government jobs. Units of government, whether federal, state or local, shouldn't be in competition with private enterprise for products and services that can be provided much more cost effectively by the private sector. Privatization can also accommodate construction infrastructure needs of government when public funding might otherwise be difficult or impossible.    Troy T.
