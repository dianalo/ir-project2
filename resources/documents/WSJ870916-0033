Grossman to a moderate two-year prison term for securities fraud and mail fraud, disappointing the Justice Department's insider-trading prosecutors.    It's understood that prosecutors and other lawyers thought a sentence of four to five years might be imposed on the 34-year-old Mr. Grossman, formerly of the law firm of Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin andamp; Frankel. He was convicted on 38 felony charges.    The case involved only a total of $1.5 million in alleged profits, relatively small in insider trading cases, but Mr. Grossman didn't cooperate with the government, as have many others recently accused of insider trading. And federal Judge Richard Owen, a tough sentencer, had remarked that the jury &quot;would have been blind&quot; not to convict him.    Judge Owen also imposed a $25,000 fine and five years' probation.    Mr. Grossman could be eligible for parole in as little as 8 months.    Howard Wilson, chief of the U.S. attorney's criminal division, declined to comment on the sentence. He had urged that a &quot;substantial&quot; prison term be imposed.    Defense attorney Irving P. Seidman called the sentence &quot;inappropriate and uncalled-for,&quot; because he said his client didn't violate any laws. He said he would appeal.    &quot;You made a killing and it ended up killing you,&quot; Judge Owen told Mr. Grossman, who had been an $85,000-a-year associate at the Kramer Levin firm. The firm worked with Colt Industries Inc.'s pension plan in Colt's 1986 recapitalization. A jury in August convicted Mr. Grossman of leaking advance word of the recapitalization to his family before Colt's stock price shot up, helping them make $1.5 million on a $33,938 investment in Colt options. Mr. Grossman was accused of getting a $25,000 cut.    Though more moderate than expected, Mr. Grossman's sentence matched the longest yet meted out in the unrelated Dennis Levine-Ivan Boesky Wall Street scandal, the jail term of two years imposed on Mr. Levine. The longest sentence ever given in a U.S. insider-trading case was four years.    Prosecutors were aware of the public-relations importance of the case. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani stated in a pre-sentencing letter to Judge Owen, submitted by Mr. Wilson: &quot;The sentence in this case will become known to the groups needing deterrence.&quot;    Judge Owen commented that his sentencing decisions were difficult -- Mr. Grossman has five children under 10 -- but added that prison was needed. &quot;You're not going to send a message to anyone in this world if you get caught and get a suspended sentence or community service,&quot; the judge said. </TEXT></DOC>
