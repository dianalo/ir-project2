For the first time in a decade, there are prospects that Congress could pass legislation calling for limits on total campaign expenditures and special-interest contributions along with partial public financing of Senate campaigns.    &quot;I feel a distinct change,&quot; says Sen. David Boren (D., Okla.), a leader in last year's effort to restrict contributions from political-action committees, or PACs. &quot;There's more of a recognition that the status quo is indefensible.&quot;    This month's disclosures that Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, operated a $10,000 breakfast club for lobbyists and that Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) undertook a similar fund-raising gambit, also have added urgency to the call for change.    &quot;The fact that Lloyd Bentsen so quickly disbanded the group of his lobbyist friends is a measure that we recognize the danger of undue influence from large organizations,&quot; says Sen. Robert Stafford (R., Vt.). &quot;These people are acting legally, but you can't subconsciously avoid being influenced by the money.&quot;    With overall congressional campaign spending up fourfold in the past decade, there are other indicators of the new mood here. Common Cause, the self-styled citizens' lobby that has been at the forefront of efforts to overhaul campaign financing, reports the largest number of new members and the highest return on direct-mail appeals since 1974, the Watergate year.    &quot;People who want to defend any questionable system like the PAC system,&quot; says Fred Wertheimer, the organization's president, &quot;have a harder time doing it in an environment like this, when everyone is exploring abuses and misuses of power.&quot;    That became agonizingly apparent to Sen. Byrd earlier this month when the Democratic leader was forced to explain why he, a prime sponsor of campaign-overhaul legislation, feels the need to entertain $10,000 donors in receptions in the capital. &quot;I can't raise that kind of money in West Virginia,&quot; he says, arguing that he can't help win changes in the campaign-finance system if he can't hold his own seat.    Mr. Byrd now says the chances for a comprehensive overhaul are &quot;very good&quot; -- a more limited bill won an important test vote last year but didn't gain final passage -- and he has made Mr. Boren's bill, called Senate Bill 2 as a measure of its importance, a top legislative priority for the 100th Congress.    But federal funding of congressional campaigns has its strong detractors; even Sen. Boren, who agreed to it only because the Supreme Court ruled spending limits couldn't be imposed outside of a voluntary system with public funds, says he's &quot;not wild&quot; about the concept. And many lobby groups, worried that an important avenue of winning political influence will be blocked, say they will fight it.    &quot;We're real cool to public financing,&quot; says Albert Abrahams, senior vice president for governmental affairs at the National Association of Realtors, which gave just under $2.7 million in the last election cycle to candidates for federal office. &quot;We're either going to have a Federal Election Commission as big as the Department of Agriculture or nobody will ever know who won the election because they'll all be challenged. The result could be a disruption of the political marketplace.&quot;    Though there is broad Democratic support for campaign-finance revision in the Senate, where the Democrats hold a 55-45 advantage, backers of the Boren plan need 60 votes, enough to cut off a filibuster. For that reason, advocates of overhauling the campaign-finance system are reminding Republicans that President Reagan has voluntarily accepted more than $90 million in public campaign funds in his three presidential campaigns.    Public financing is &quot;not a radical new approach,&quot; says Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D., Calif.), who has introduced separate legislation to provide each major-party House candidate with $200,000 in federal funding. &quot;It has been tested in the last three presidential elections, and it has been an outstanding success.&quot;    At the same time, strategists are targeting Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole, who has been reluctant to embrace campaign-finance overhaul in the past but who is expected to accept federal funds if he seeks the 1988 GOP presidential nomination.    &quot;Dole faces a central challenge as he heads into the 1988 presidential campaign,&quot; says Mr. Wertheimer. &quot;Is he going to defend the PAC system and all it stands for again, or is he going to be part of the solution to this basic integrity issue?&quot;    Mr. Dole, whose Senate campaign received $1 million in PAC contributions in the past two years, hasn't taken a position on the newest proposal, but aides say he is skeptical. &quot;We're for campaign 'reform' as long as it's really fair and really reform, not some gimmick to sock it to the Republicans by cutting off our means of raising money,&quot; says Walt Riker, spokesman for the senator from Kansas.    A Common Cause study found that PAC contributions to Senate general-election candidates in the most recent election cycle neared $46 million, with 14 senators raising more than $1 million each in PAC contributions.    But Democrats say they're more concerned about about the time involved in raising money; the Conservative Digest estimates that the average Senate freshman will have to raise $125,000 every month for the next six years to keep up with the rising costs of political campaigns.    &quot;Campaign inflation is out of control,&quot; says Rep. Tony Coelho (D., Calif.), who was an imaginative fund-raiser as head of his party's House campaign committee. &quot;I've never been shy about raising money, but something's wrong when candidates are forced to spend more time talking to contributors than constituents.&quot;    Meanwhile, there is a growing consensus that some adjustments must be made in rules governing spending in presidential elections. These changes would include restricting the use of state parties as conduits for contributions that are otherwise illegal in federal campaigns, increasing the current $1,000 individual limit on contributions to provide more money for primary campaigns and eliminating the widely abused state-by-state spending limits.    The Boren bill would establish a voluntary system of spending limits tied to partial public financing of Senate races. Candidates and their immediate families would be limited to spending $20,000 of their own money in a general-election campaign and couldn't exceed overall spending limits determined by the population of their states. Those who agree to these strictures then would be eligible for an amount of public funds that also would be determined by state population.    At the same time, all Senate candidates would be subject to an overall limit on PAC contributions ranging from $175,000 in small states to $750,000 in large states, with House candidates subject to a $100,000 limit. The result would be a new political landscape, with a new set of rules.    &quot;The system is not working,&quot; says Sen. George Mitchell of Maine, former chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. &quot;It's demeaning for the candidates, it's demeaning for the voters, it's demeaning for the country.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
