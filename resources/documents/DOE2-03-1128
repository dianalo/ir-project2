It ischaracterised by high sensitivity in detecting bone marrow lesions, highsoft tissue - bone tissue contrast, sharp demarcation of intraosseouslesions and visualisation of vascular structures without applicationof contrast medium. Thus it is able above all to take on the findingsof radionuclide bone scanning, computed tomography and angiography. Inthe detection of pathophysiological alterations of the corticalis andof calcifications it is less reliable than X-ray images and CT.</TEXT></DOC>
