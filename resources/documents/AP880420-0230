U.S. officers appeared generally satisfied with the naval actionagainst Iranian warships Monday, though some said the results couldhave been better.   Some officers appeared concerned that the Sabalan, one of theIranian frigates hit by U.S. missiles, was not sunk.   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci told reporters in Washingtonthe Sabalan attack was not followed up because the ship appearedcrippled.   Senior U.S. officers said the missile exchange Monday was overas far as the United States was concerned, but there was noassurance Iran felt the same way.   Capt. Donald Dyer, commander of the Desron 22, made up of someof the U.S. warships in the gulf, said the situation remainedpretty tense.   ``But I think it's beginning to back off a little bit. TheIranians took some pretty heavy losses. I would hope today theywould disengage,'' he said Tuesday.   Cmdr. Edward Mann, 42, skipper of this 3,700-ton frigate flyingthe flag of Dyer's command, said he was surprised by Iran'sreaction and did not believe the issue of Iran's predatory attackson neutral commercial shipping has been settled.   ``There ain't a winner until the game is over,'' he said.   The clashes began with the U.S. naval attack on Iranian oilplatforms early Monday and continued through the day.   In the action, Iran fired Chinese-made Silkworm anti-shipmissiles deployed along the Strait of Hormuz, gateway to the Gulf,for the first time.   Five of the huge subsonic projectiles were lobbed at the JackWilliams and two destroyers sailing with it.   All the missiles went awry, their radar guidance systemsconfused by showers of aluminum chaff fired into the air by theAmerican ships.   Four went into the sea and one skimmed beyond the Williams'stern and struck an oil rig.   A sixth was fired from Iranian positions in the northern end ofthe gulf, but officers on the Williams did not know what happenedto it.   Lt. Cmdr. Carl Van Dyke, a Navy spokesman, said there were noAmerican casualties in Monday's actions and Iranian casualties werenot known.   (In Washington, the Pentagon called off the search for ahelicopter that did not return to the USS Wainwright on Monday andlisted its two crew members as missing.)   The United States claimed one Iranian patrol boat sunk, threearmed Swedish-built speedboats sunk or damaged, and two frigatesdisabled.   In addition, Van Dyke said, the two oil platforms at Sirri andSassan in the south-central gulf were neutralized by naval gunfireand by a Marine attack.   U.S. officials said both were used for military purposes,including support for speedboats attacking neutral ships inretaliation for Iraqi air strikes on Iran's oil tankers during the7{-year-old war.   When an Iranian tugboat at Sirri radioed the cruiser Wainwrightfor permission to pick up survivors in the water, Capt. James.Chandler, the courtly Arkansan who commands the 8,200-ton warship,agreed and dropped lifeboats.   U.S. officers said the two frigates, Sahand and Sabalan, alsofired on U.S. aircraft after they ignored warnings against takingany hostile action.   This happened when the Williams' ``surface action group,'' whichalso included the missile destroyer Joseph Strauss and thedestroyer O'Brien, received word an Iranian flotilla _ the Sahandand at least eight Boghammer speedboats _ was approaching fromIran's naval base at Bandar Abbas, 30 miles to the north.   ``The Sahand is in your vicinity. Take him,'' was the tersemessage from Rear. Adm. Anthony Less, commander of the Joint TaskForce Middle East.   U.S. officers said two A-6 intruder jets from the USSEnterprise, flying air cover, drew missile fire from the Sahand asthey made a reconnaissance flight over the Iranian ships.   They retaliated with Harpoon missiles that damaged the12-year-old British-built frigate.   Then the Strauss, sailing just ahead of the Williams, firedanother Harpoon, blasting the ship from 20 miles away.   When last seen by an American pilot, it was listing badly with ahole in its hull and its superstructure ablaze. Whether it sank wasnot known, Van Dyke said.   The Babaland, the Sahand's sister ship, was hit by F-14 Tomcatsalso flying off the Enterprise in the Arabian Sea.   It was hit by a laser-guided, cluster-type skipper bomb and leftdead in the water. It was not known what happened to the ship sincethe attack.</TEXT></DOC>
