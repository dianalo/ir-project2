The influence of temperature andoxygen on char burning time is noted together with furnace and operationalfactors influencing burnout. Burnout measurements of pulverized coalsare discussed both in power stations and at pilot or laboratory scale.Coal properties used to correlate burnout are assessed and some additionalcharacterisation techniques are given. Mechanistic mathematical modelsmay be used to scale the results of laboratory experiments. 23 refs.,12 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
