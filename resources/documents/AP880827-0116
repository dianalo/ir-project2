Israeli troops shot and wounded eight Palestinians in clashesSaturday, and four more were wounded in an argument with a fellowArab suspected of being an Israeli agent, hospital officials andreporters said.   Israel radio said police in the northern port city of Haifadiscovered the Jewish boy's body in a dry riverbed in his hometownof Qiryat Tivon, 10 miles south of Haifa.   Police found his skull cap, a sign that he was religiouslyobservant, and a large rock that may have been the murder weapon,near the body, the radio said. They said Palestinian guerrillaswere suspected, but they did not elaborate.   Palestinian professional leaders rejected charges that aJerusalem-based federation of professional groups closed Friday byauthorities had instigated anti-Israeli protests.   Police said they ordered the building, which houses sevenprofessional groups including doctors, dentists and lawyers, shutfor one year because members were holding meetings under theauspices of terror organizations and planned to ``establishalternative structures to the Israeli administration.''   Israel closed a West Bank union representing 38 different tradeson Thursday.   ``The police accusations are groundless,'' said Walid Asali,chairman of the Arab Bar Association. ``Our objectives are to helpout members, manage a retirement fund, plan lectures and licensenew members.''   Earlier this month, Israel outlawed the so-called popularcommittees that have sprung up in towns and villages throughout theoccupied territories.   The Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, criticized as ``one-sided'' theU.N. Security Council's condemnation of Israel's policy ofdeporting Palestinian activists.   The Security Council on Friday demanded that Israel allow 33activists already expelled to return immediately to their homes.   ``Israel expresses displeasure with the Security Council'sone-sided approach, which ignored Israel's security needs,'' saidMinistry spokesman Alon Liel. He said Israel would continue to usedeportations selectively.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, the army imposed a curfew on theNusseirat refugee camp after troops opened fire to break up violentdemonstrations, residents said. Hospital officials said sevenresidents suffered moderate wounds.   An eighth man was in critical condition after being shot in theabdomen during a protest at the nearby Bureij camp earlier in theday, hospital officials said.   Clashes also broke out in Rafah at the southern tip of Gaza,where troops used tear gas and nightsticks to disperse more than100 protesters who tried to hold an illegal march.   The army also clamped curfews on three West Bank villages southof Jerusalem, fearing renewed unrest.   Underground Palestinian leaders had dedicated Saturday as a dayfor ``striking forces to direct blows against those who refuse toresign from their posts,'' referring to Arabs who work with Israeliauthorities.   But the only attack reported occurred Friday night, when LabiebHassan, who fellow Palestinians say is an agent for the Israelis,shot and wounded three Arabs who demanded he stop informing onactivists.   A local reporter said the clash was in Illar, a small farmingvillage in the occupied West Bank.   During the incident the mukhtar, or village leader, emerged fromhis home with an army-issued submachine gun and also startedshooting, slightly wounding an elderly woman, the Arab reportersaid.   The army refused to give details on the incident, describing itas ``an argument between local residents.''   Only Palestinians working for the Israeli militaryadministration are allowed to carry weapons.   Palestinian leaders have been calling for the resignation ofIsraeli-appointed mayors and other employees since the beginning ofthe Arab uprising.   Since it began Dec. 8, the Palestinian revolt against Israel'soccupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip _ seized from Jordan andEgypt in 1967 _ has claimed 254 Palestinian lives. Four Israelishave died.</TEXT></DOC>
