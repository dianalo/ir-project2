She is angered that Lithuanian is theofficial language and does not like the democraticallyelected government there, which she and the KGB-controlledSoviet troops have tried to overthrow.   Lithuania's people abhor Russian colonists like Mrs.Mkhitaryan, because they represent the legacy of the bloody,50-year Soviet oppression. More than 300,000 Lithuanians weredeported to the Siberian death camps by the Communists. Thesecolonists were then brought into the homes and farms of thedeportees. They displaced them from their homes and now theyare trying to displace their language.</LP><TEXT>   Liutas K. Jurskis   Red Bank, N.J.</TEXT></DOC>
