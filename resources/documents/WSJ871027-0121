On Friday, the Sandinista government canceled a program that for the previous four weekends had allowed thousands of Nicaraguans to cross into Costa Rica for a few hours to see relatives who have taken refuge there. Officials gave many reasons, but the real one seemed to be that many people who crossed the frontier kept on going, seeking asylum themselves.    The border troubles are an embarrassment for the Sandinistas and an indication of the unexpected problems being caused it by the peace accords signed in August by the Central American presidents. Allowing cross-border visits wasn't specifically called for in the accords, but it seemed a popular goodwill gesture. To draw back now is &quot;quite unfortunate timing for the peace process,&quot; says a West European diplomat in Managua.    The closure order didn't altogether stem the impulse to leave. By 7 a.m. Sunday, a strange parade of more than 1,000 poor campesinos was marching from the town of Rivas toward the border about 15 miles away, some beating sticks on the ground, some swinging machetes lazily. They got as far as this bridge, where two dozen soldiers behind barricades trained automatic weapons on them. Before the morning was over, there would be a bit of blood and an eloquent display of some of the pressures clawing at Nicaraguan society.    &quot;So it has gotten this bad,&quot; sighs Marta Elena Alvarez, a peasant woman balancing a bag of corncobs on her head and a baby on her shoulder, as she watches the crowd inch toward the soldiers. &quot;When will the angels come to save this forsaken country?&quot;    The events at the border indicate that, less than two weeks before the deadline for completing some of the accords' conditions, thousands of Nicaraguans are more eager to flee than to wait around to see if peace and democracy break out. On Oct. 18, an estimated 1,200 Nicaraguans took advantage of the border program to stampede into Costa Rican refugee camps. Another 3,000 people were pushed back by Sandinista troops.    &quot;These people feel they have no future here,&quot; says Mario Rappaciolli, a right-wing opposition politician in Managua. &quot;They don't believe the present government is capable of bringing peace.&quot;    The Sandinistas say they closed the border because Costa Rican officials were encouraging Nicaraguans to seek sanctuary, a charge the Costa Ricans deny. Over the weekend, the Sandinistas also accused the Honduran army and U.S.-backed Contra rebels of interfering with an identical border program at Las Manos, along the Honduran frontier near several Nicaraguan refugee camps. Many diplomats in Managua viewed the charges as a prelude to closing that crossing, too.    Technically, Nicaragua permits its citizens to emigrate. But they must have a passport, and fighting the bureaucracy to get one can take months. Young men can't leave without proving they've completed their military service. Thus, the open-border program was an opportunity to shortcut the regulations. The Nicaraguans who flocked to do so Sunday were simple people who have always been poor. Politics has little meaning for them, but war and hunger do, and they are sick of both.    &quot;I am a campesino,&quot; says Augusto Diaz, a weathered herdsman in a battered straw hat, whose palms are scarred with rope burns and cuts. &quot;I don't like the government. I don't like &quot;la Contra.&quot; I just want to live in peace and have beans to eat, but I can't do that here any more.&quot;    Heading out from Rivas, the pilgrims are an odd collection: old women with cloth bundles across their backs, teen-agers full of bluster and a few men pushing wood-wheeled carts.    &quot;What can they do against the thousands we have with us here?&quot; shouts 17-year-old Luis Henriquez, who has walked and hitchhiked the 100 miles from Managua to visit his mother and two brothers in Costa Rica. &quot;We can die of hunger or we can die of bullets.&quot;    Suddenly, shots. Sandinista police, quickly reinforced by a small squad of army regulars, have driven from behind, parked their jeeps at the head of the procession and begun firing more or less into the air. They tell the marchers to go home. A teen-age boy is propelled by a surge in the crowd toward a young, frightened-looking policeman. The policeman cracks the boy with a rifle butt across the cheek, opening a bloody gash. Later, rumors ripple through the crowd that the teen-ager died from the blow.    The police and the troops issue more warnings and withdraw further south, toward the bridge. Soon, the crowd again begins to move in that direction. &quot;They treat us like dogs,&quot; roars Mercedes Lopez, who has come from Leon.    According to government statistics, about 400,000 Nicaraguans -- 15% of the nation's population -- have fled since the Sandinistas brought down dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979. That is one of the greatest population flights in modern Latin American history. The wealthy and professional classes got out first, but now a lot of ordinary people, including youths trying to dodge the draft, are leaving.    The bitterness found in this crowd isn't universal. The Sandinistas still have support in much of the country, though the war and a ruined economy have eroded their popularity. Even here on the road to the border, hatred of the government doesn't translate into support for the U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas.    &quot;I won't fight for the government, and I won't fight for the Contras,&quot; says a 16-year-old named Humberto Ruiz. He has had brothers killed fighting for both sides. &quot;Either side you fight for, you end up just as dead.&quot;    About 25 yards from the foot of this bridge, the parade halts. A local Sandinista political official with a bull horn exhorts the crowd to turn back. He is jeered. &quot;The soldiers on the bridge have orders to not permit you to pass -- that's the way it is, comrades,&quot; the official says.    The crowd mills. Enterprising businessmen wheel ice cream carts through it. Slowly the people advance to the bridge entrance, about 10 yards from the wall of soldiers. &quot;What's going to happen to us?&quot; asks a worried Anna Maria Castro.    Nothing. This crowd isn't looking for a fight. People chant and taunt for a few minutes, then clamber aboard trucks sent by the Red Cross to take them back to Rivas. &quot;But we'll be back next week,&quot; says Luis, the youngster who earlier talked about the distinction between starvation and death by bullets. &quot;Today, I prefer to die slowly.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
