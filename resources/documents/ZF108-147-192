Copyright Office.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>First U.S.andP;  copyright for PostScript font Adobe Systems announced that theU.S.andP;  Copyright Office has registered its copyright for a PostScript-languagetypeface program--that is, a font.andP;  This ruling is likely to havefar-reaching--and, we believe, favorable--implications for the entireindustry.andM;Until now, the Copyright Office has steadfastly refused to register anycopyrights for fonts.andP;  (*1)  In the autumn of 1988, the Registrar ofCopyrights issued a formal statement affirming that position.andP;  (See Vol.andP;  3,No.andP;  5.andP;  p. 29.)andP;  As we have moved into a world in which fonts are encoded asdigital information, this stance has engendered real concern.andP;  There appearedto be little legal protection in the U.S.andP;  against blatant pirating ofdigitized typefaces, and therefore redued incentive for typeface vendors toinvest in new designs and larger libraries of digitized faces.andM;Phototypesetter vendors routinely &quot;stole&quot; each other's type faces byredrawing new master designs from photo-enlarged copies of typeset output ofa competitor's face.andP;  This required a lot of work.andP;  However, digital data canbe copied directly with no loss in quality.andP;  This makes pirating typefacesinfinitely easier.andM;An important distinction.andP;  The Copyright Office had previously regardeddigitized font data as only an encoding of the font design, and hence no moreprotectable than the font itself.andP;  The current law provides that &quot;merelettering&quot; cannot be copyrighted; nor can a simple &quot;listing of ingredients.&quot;andO;The Copyright Office had earlier held that the computer data making up a fontwas similar to a listing of ingredients and not an original expressionofauthorship.andP;  However, a PostScript font is also a computer program (asequence of statements and commands in a computer programming language, whichPostScript is) and U.S.andP;  copyright law explicitly provides copyrightprotection for software.andM;Adobe used an interesting ploy to persuade the Copyright Office to see itthis way.andP;  With the cooperation of Bitstream, Adobe submitted listings of twodifferent encodings of the same letterform from an ITC font; one was thePostScript encoding, the other was Bitstream's line and arc format.andP;  Thisestablished that the two formats were not at all equivalent (as a list ofingredients would be) and thus proved that they were works of authorship.andM;What is covered.andP;  It would appear that same logic woudl apply to otherspecific sequences of instructions which describe type characters.andP;  IfAdobe-format fonts are copyrightable, so should be Royal-format fonts,Intellifont-format fonts, etc.andP;  This means that font vendors who encode theirfonts in one or more of these formats should be able to receive copyrightprotection for those particular encodings.andM;This still does not mean that the underlying character shapes arecopyrightable.andP;  As far as we can see, the copyright on a particular sequenceof PostScript instructions does not prevent someone from printing a characterat very high resolution, then fitting curves to the resulting image andexpressing the result in another computer language such as Royal orIkarus--or even PostScript, provided the instructions are arranged somewhatdifferently.andP;  The instructions themselves have not been copied, and theresulting character can be redigitized to whatever degree of fidelity isdesired.andM;On the other hand, the courts would probably hold that the copyright preventssomeone from using a computer program to trnaslate the PostScript codedirectly into another computer language.andP;  That would be a derivative work,just like translating a book into a foriegn language.andM;Implications.andP;  We see three implications.andP;  First, it is obvioius thatPostScript fonts are now going to enjoy much better legal protection thanbefore.andP;  Under U.S.andP;  law, a copyright exists from the moment an original workis created, whether or not the copyright is registered in Washington.andP;  Hence,all PostScript fonts, provided they bear a copyright notice and meet othertechnical requirements, are retroactively protected against copyrightinfringement.andM;Adobe plans to register the copyrights on all of its 600+ fonts as fast aspossible.andP;  We believe that other major PostScript font foundries will do thesame.andP;  This is a matter of legal strategy.andP;  It is a formal requirement of lawthat you can only sue for infringement if the copyright has been registeredwith the Copyright Office, even if you only register the day before you filesuit.andP;  However, the longer the registration has been in effect, the moredamages you are likely to be awarded if and when you do file suit.andP;  There isalso a legal doctrine that says if you fail to maintain your rights, you canlose them.andM;Second, we would expect other vendors with digital font technologies thatrely on programmed instructions will immediately try to persuade thecopyright office to grant their fonts the same protection now affordedPost-Script fonts.andP;  We expect that the major players should be successful inthis effort.andM;Third, this will almost certainly strengthen the political arguments forgranting more general protection to fonts.andP;  Previously it was possible toassert that a font is a font no matter how it is encoded; now a font's legalstatus clearly does depend on how it is encoded.andP;  While this does notdirectly undermine the legal rationale for denying protection to fontdesigns, it chips away at the edges of it.andP;  The Typeface Design Coalitionplans to keep up its efforts to get Congress to pass new legislation grantingtype designers some level of protection.andM;The Coalition is not asking for the same level of protection that writtenworks and paintings enjoy, which extends for the life of the creator plus 50years.andP;  While it is important to provide designers with legal rights, thereare good reasons to set a short time limit, perhaps seven to ten years, onthose rights.andP;  One reason is that there are very real constraints, based onreadability and public acceptance, on the amount of variation that ispossible in letter-form design.andP;  Another is the time-honored and legitimatepractice of looking to traditional designs as the basis for new fonts.andM;User benefits.andP;  Although there are many users who tacitly or openly supportthe rights of piracy, we believe that this is both morally shoddy and veryshort-sighted.andP;  In the end, we believe that copyright protection is animportant means of rewarding creative effort and encouraging competition.andO;There are, of course, some delicate balances to be struck.andP;  Just asuncontrolled piracy of digitized typefaces can undermine the market, so toocan excessive litigation to protect property rights.andP;  Since many font designsare rather similar to competing products, and there are only so many ways towrite a computer program that gives a particular result, it is inevitablethat some portions of one vendor's code will be highly similar to anothervendor's code.andP;  The trick is going to be to move towards policies whichencourage fair and open competition without plunging the industry into amorass of lawsuits.andM;On balance, we welcome the Adobe copyright decision.andP;  We want to see open andvigorous competition in the digital font market, with thousands ofalternatives to choose from and prices so low that they encourage users tobuild huge font libraries.andP;  We think that reasonable protection ofintellectual property is essential to helping this to come about.andM;(*) Oddly, in July, 1986, the Copyright Office did grant a copyright to ChuckBigelow for his Lucida font series, which was encoded by Ikarus commands.andO;This was apparently a fluke, hoever, and had no impact on subsequentdecisions.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
