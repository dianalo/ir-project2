Although BarneyscanXP isprimarily an image editing program, it has two significant advantages overBarneyscanMac for scanning.andP;  The first is that it uses virtual memorytechniques, thereby allowing you to work on large color images while usingonly 2 Mbytes of RAM rather than the 5 Mbytes required by BarneyscanMac.andP;  Thesecond is the prescan feature, which performs a fast scan that results in alow-resolution black-and-white image.andP;  You can use the prescan image to setcropping borders, resize percentages, and adjust exposure settings so thatthe image is cropped and resized during the final scan.andP;  The prescan takesabout a minute, as compared with seven minutes for the final scan, so thetime saved is significant.andM;During both the prescan and the final scan, a built-in default gammaadjustment is applied to the image as it is displayed.andP;  However, you canchange this value.andP;  The results of gamma adjustments are displayedinteractively as you make them.andP;  The default Automatic Exposure setting givesadequate results for slides containing an average range of contrasts, buthighly contrasting images generally require a manually set exposure setting.andO;The digital scope feature is useful here.andP;  It displays in graph form thedensities of a vertical slice of the slide.andP;  By moving the slide backward andforward manually, you can obtain a good idea of the tonal range of the image.andO;At the same time, you can adjust the exposure slider and see the effects ofthose adjustments on the density curve.andM;BarneyscanXP's image editing features are worthy of a review unto themselves.andO;In addition to a complete set of color paint tools, the program can handle upto 16 eight-bit channels per image.andP;  These channels can be used as selectionmasks or as scratch pads for experimentation.andP;  The Filters command provides awealth of options, such as Sharpen, Blur, Diffuse, Find Edges and Despeckle.andO;The program supports all common Macintosh formats (TIFF, PICT2, EncapsulatedPostScript, Compu-Serve GIF and Thunderscan) in addition to its ownproprietary format.andP;  It also supports PIXAR, Amiga IFF/ILBM and a powerfulRaw format that can be used to import images in formats that aren't directlysupported.andP;  The clear and comprehensive documentation includes awell-thought-out tutorial that quickly brings you up to speed on theprogram's intricacies.andM;The Nikon LS-3500.andP;  The Nikon LS-3500 slide scanner is still technically inbeta testing, but it is available for sale and hence eligible for reviewhere.andP;  Nikon Inc.'s efforts in developing special optics for this scanner areamply repaid by the ease of use and high resolution that the unit offers.andM;The LS-3500 uses a GPIB board to connect to the Macintosh.andP;  This must bepurchased separately.andP;  After installing the board and connecting it to thescanner, you must also install a proprietary INIT and cdev (Control Paneldevice) in your System folder.andP;  The final step is to use a specialapplication that configures the GPIB board correctly for the scanner.andP;  Thephotocopied documentation contains clear instructions on how to accomplishthis, and the Colorflex scanning software includes an interface test thatconfirms the setup.andM;Scanning with the Nikon LS-3500.andP;  Much of the Nikon scanner's ease of usestems from the fact that it is self-calibrating and that it focusesautomatically.andP;  Four slide holders are supplied with the package, eachdesigned to hold a different kind of slide mount.andP;  The manual contains acomprehensive listing of the types of slide mounts in use worldwide and thecorrect holder to use for each.andP;  Once you have loaded the slide in the rightholder with the correct orientation, you can simply place it in the scanner,close the dust cover and start scanning using the Colorflex software'sdefault settings.andM;Colorflex lacks BarneyscanXP's image editing features, but it allows a greatdeal of control over the scanning process itself.andP;  The first time you choosethe Color/ Grayscale Preview function, the scanner performs a task calledpre-scan sensitometry, which examines the range of light to dark tones in theimage.andP;  It then performs a scan and displays the result in either eight-bitor 24-bit color, depending on the monitor setting.andP;  You can use this previewimage to set cropping borders and as a basis for adjustments to the exposureand gamma controls.andM;The Basic Color Controls dialog box contains contrast and brightness controlssimilar to those on a television.andP;  It also has red, green and blue tintcontrols, which are useful for making minor adjustments to color balance.andO;The Analog Exposure Controls dialog takes a different approach.andP;  You canassign numeric values for red, green and blue gain that effectively changethe f-stop of the exposure.andP;  The Overall Exposure setting works the same wayand applies equally to the red, green and blue settings.andP;  Transparencies,whether positive or negative, usually have a wider dynamic range from dark tolight than can easily be printed on paper.andP;  The Black Level Threshold controlallows you to lighten or darken the blackest black in an image withoutaffecting the midtones or highlights.andP;  The third control dialog box, theGamma Curve Controls, lets you set a gamma value for each channel (red, greenand blue) and set values for the highlights and shadows in each channel.andP;  Ineffect, the gamma value sets the slope of the gamma curve, while thehighlight and shadow controls set the curve's end points.andM;Before scanning to a disk file, you need to choose the resolution pitchsetting, which controls the final size of the scan.andP;  The maximum resolutionof the scanner is 6,144 by 4,096 pixels, which results in a 75-Mbyte file.andO;To determine the file size, you divide the total resolution of the scanner bythe pitch setting number.andP;  Thus, the default setting of eight gives a scan of768 by 512 pixels.andP;  You can set the pitch from zero to 50.andP;  The very highresolutions are primarily useful for scanning a small area of a slide.andM;One thing we didn't like about the Colorflex software was its non-standardapproach to file naming.andP;  When you start scanning to disk, you are asked toname a folder.andP;  The resulting scan appears in the folder, with the file nameTIFF.INT.andP;  It is accompanied by three files named RED, GREEN and BLUE, whichare the raw results of the scanning passes.andP;  Having to continually rename theTIFF.INT files is a chore, as is throwing away the raw scan files.andP;  Thisdefect mars the otherwise seamless performance of the Nikon package.andM;Conclusions.andP;  In our comparison of the two scanners, the first thing wenoticed is how much easier the Nikon is to use than the Barneyscan, becauseit requires neither calibration nor focusing.andP;  It's also faster than theBarneyscan when scanning at the same resolution.andP;  Choosing a lower resolutionyields even better performance.andP;  We used two images in comparative testing;one had a subtle range of tones, the other extreme contrasts.andP;  Both scannershandled the low-contrast image well, but the Nikon was clearly superior inpicking out details in the dark regions of the high-contrast image.andP;  Giventhe relatively small difference in price between the two units, we recommendthe Nikon over the Barneyscan, despite the latter's excellent software.andM;The Barneyscan Slide Scanner package contains some of the best scanning andimage editing software we have seen, but the hardware, while adequate, failsto measure up to the Nikon LS-3500.andP;  The calibration process for theBarneyscan product is a hassle, and we wonder what happens to the scanner'saccuracy when the special calibration slide is no longer in pristinecondition.andP;  The manual focusing is also problematic: No matter how much timewe spent fiddling with the focus controls, we were often left wondering if wecould have made the focus sharper if we'd fiddled with it more.andM;The Nikon scanner's self-calibration and auto-focusing set a new standard inease of use for slide scanners.andP;  It's also noticeably faster than theBarneyscan, is capable of four-times-higher resolution and is only slightlymore expensive.andP;  While the Nikon Colorflex software's non-standard filehandling methods are annoying, the package's advantages more than outweighits disadvantages.andP;  If you're really in the market for a $10,000 slidescanner, we have no hesitation in recommending the Nikon LS-3500.andM;We had originally planned to review slide scanners from Eikonix Corp. ofBedford, Mass., and Howtek Inc. of Hudson, N.H., in addition to the machinesfrom Barneyscan Corp. and Nikon Inc., but we were unable to obtain workingunits from those manufacturers in time to meet our deadlines.andP;  This is notnecessarily a reflection on those manufacturers' products.andP;  Rather, itillustrates the difficulties of troubleshooting devices that connect to theMacintosh via the GPIB interface, a NuBus board that is commonly used withslide scanners, film recorders, and some color printers and scanners.andM;The Mac GPIB (General Purpose Interface Bus) interface consists of a NuBusboard, a cable, System software and an installer application.andP;  It has becomesomething of a standard interface for slide scanners, and when it works, itworks well.andP;  Still, it is far from user friendly and is complicated totroubleshoot.andM;First, we had to determine that the board itself was installed correctly andwas functioning.andP;  There's a test program to check the board itself, but youmust unplug any devices from the board first.andP;  Next, we checked cables byswapping them.andP;  Then, we checked for Startup document (INIT) conflicts byremoving all unnecessary INITs from the System folder.andP;  Finally, we checkedthe GPIB setup using the installer application.andM;The installer application makes an attempt at following the Mac userinterface with menus and dialog boxes, but the dialog boxes contain crypticphrases like &quot;Assert REN when SC&quot; or &quot;Terminate EOS at last write of byte.&quot;andO;The error messages are even worse.andP;  For example, &quot;unable to _ibclr _sp gpibscanner GPIB TIMEOUT error: (EASC) address status change during I/O command.&quot;andO;The technical support personnel from the companies involved were invariablycourteous and helpful, but their advice always came down to &quot;try anotherscanner with the board and see if it works&quot; or &quot;try the scanner with anotherboard and see if it works.&quot; Naturally, this is problematical for thosewithout access to another scanner.andM;For the record, here is a list of the scanners we tested and their trackrecords.andM;Barneyscan Slide Scanner: This one worked the first time.andM;Nikon LS-3500: The first unit we tested had a problem with keeping the red,green and blue scans in registration.andP;  The second unit performed according tospecifications.andM;Howtek Scanmaster 35: The first unit we tested showed pronounced scan linesand had problems with color fidelity.andP;  The replacement unit failed to makecontact with the Macintosh.andM;Eikonix 1435: The unit we tested failed to make contact with the Mac despitethe heroic efforts of the technical support people at Pre-Press TechnologiesInc. of Encinitas, Calif., which makes the Spectre-Scan software for theEikonix scanner.andM;This makes for a total of two functioning units out of the six we tested.andO;The sample of scanners that passed through our hands is too small to deriveany kind of statistically significant data.andP;  On the other hand, you shouldmake sure you feel comfortable with technical debugging before purchasing oneof these units.andP;  -- By Bruce FraserandM;BARNEYSCAN CORP.andM;Barneyscan Slide Scanner: $9,495andM;1198 10th St., Berkeley, Calif.andP;
