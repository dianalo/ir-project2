Canada and allies in Europe have complained about the measure. But so far they can't convince its primary sponsor, Sen. Jake Garn (R., Utah), to pull it out of the bill. &quot;He's set in concrete,&quot; a worried administration lobbyist says.    The provision slipped by without much opposition because the administration's attention was focused on another section of the bill that would retroactively punish Toshiba Corp. for a subsidiary's past shipments of propeller-milling machines to the Soviet Union. But the administration now believes the bill's &quot;prospective&quot; sanctions could inflict even more harm to allied unity.    Commerce Department officials fear the measure could harm the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, through which the U.S. obtains the voluntary cooperation of Japan and North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries in efforts to deny the Soviets militarily-sensitive technology.    The proposed sanctions on future violators are more Draconian than those on Toshiba. The ban would hit not only the actual violator but its parent company and all its affiliates unless it is based in a country with an effective export-control system and the parent itself has a good compliance record. But even in that case the parent would be denied U.S. government contracts for at least two years.    By comparison, Toshiba would be injured less because only a small subsidiary would be subject to both the import and federal-procurement ban, while the parent and other subsidiaries would still be able to export freely to nongovernment U.S. buyers.    State Department experts say the Garn provision theoretically could bar McDonnell Douglas Corp. from buying parts of the Harrier II jet from British Aerospace PLC if one of British Aerospace's subsidiaries violates export laws.    Commerce Department aides also worry that if other Cocom countries have reason to fear U.S. retribution, they would stop reporting violations to U.S. authorities. Such non-cooperation would defeat one of Cocom's major objectives.    A State Department official says European allies protested the measure at a Cocom executive meeting in Paris this week. Diplomatic sources report that some European finance ministers took up the subject with Treasury Secretary James Baker when they met this week for discussions on stabilizing foreign-exchange rates.    Alan Larson, acting chief of the State Department's economic affairs bureau, says that &quot;both the prospective and retroactive sanctions&quot; in the trade bill would &quot;hurt our ability to secure the cooperation of our allies.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
