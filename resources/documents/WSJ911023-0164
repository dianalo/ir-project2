The results of the reforms must be viewed inrelation to the problems that faced the new president in1989: a fiscal deficit of more than 9% of gross domesticproduct; repressed inflation through the widespread use ofprice controls (giving rise to shortages and productdeterioration); and a preferential exchange rate (with a 100%premium over the free-market rate) that was an openinvitation for over-invoicing and corruption. Thisunfortunate state of affairs gave rise to a current-accountdeficit of close to $6 billion in 1988, including Venezuela'sfirst deficit in its merchandise balance in modern times,which was financed through the sale of the bulk of theCentral Bank's foreign reserves and the use of &quot;publiclyguaranteed&quot; letters of credit (totaling $6.5 billion, whichhad to be settled in 1990, producing enormous losses for theCentral Bank).   Against this backdrop, the government's decision to adopta profound restructuring of the economy based on free-marketprinciples -- while undertaking the painful but necessarystabilization measures -- was ambitious and courageous. Theoverall macroeconomic results of the stabilization programwere, on balance, a resounding success: The current-accountregistered surpluses of $2 billion in 1989 and $8 billion in1990; the fiscal deficit shrank to 1% of GDP in 1989 andreached a surplus of 1% in 1990. The costs of this dramaticturnaround in macroeconomic indicators in 1989 were, however,steep: GDP fell more than 8% and inflation reached 80%. Thehigh inflation rate in 1989 reflected a one-time jump in theprice level, as the vast majority of prices -- including theexchange rate -- were freed from administrative control.                                                                                                          After the liberalization, only a progressively reducedbasket of basic foodstuffs remained under price controls. Itshould also be noted that the government stood firm on theprinciples of its reform program despite serious civildisturbances at the start of its term, resulting largely fromthe shortages produced by previous administrations' economicpolicies. Nonetheless, by 1990, the Venezuelan economy wasalready the fastest-growing in Latin America with an increaseof more than 5% of GDP in real terms.   It is difficult to reconcile the reduction of thegovernment's role in the allocation of resources that hasbeen implemented over the past three years with the outdatedaccusations made by Mr. Ball. The international market, aharsh but objective critic, has given Venezuela its vote ofconfidence, through the dramatic increase in direct foreigninvestment and in the pricing of our external debt onsecondary markets, which have risen from about 30% to closeto 80% of face value. The market's opinion was recentlyconfirmed by an important upgrading of our sovereign debt byboth Standard andamp; Poor's and Moody's to near investment-gradelevels. &quot;Crony Capitalism&quot; is anathema to our goals andobjectives and therefore has no place in the Venezuela thatmany of us are striving hard to create.
