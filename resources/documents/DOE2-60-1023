The papers investigate, within the framework of the interactingboson model for the excitation of the giant dipole resonance, photonscattering by non-magic even-even nuclei and present an algebraic approachto giant resonances. Schematic calculations are described for two transitionalisotope chains Pd and Sm.</TEXT></DOC>
