The Natural Resources Defense Council, a private environmentalgroup, recently gained widespread attention when it issued a reportclaiming the Environmental Protection Agency does not adequatelytake into account the relativley high consumption of fruits andvegetables by children when setting limits on cancer-causingpesticides.   The EPA has denied the allegations and said that children are notexposed to an unusual health risk because of the pesticides.   Ms. Streep said she hoped the campaign would put pressure on thegovernment to re-examine its methods of setting pesticide standardson fruits and vegetables and promote the shift to organic farming sothat such pesticides could be eliminated.   ``As parents, we care passionately about our children. Weshouldn't have to worry about the safety of the food we feed them,especially fruits and vegetables that are essential to ourchildren's health,'' said Ms. Streep, who has three children.   She is co-chair of ``Mothers and Others for Pesticide Limits,''which was formed to coordinate the campaign. Ms. Streep also agreedto take part in a television advertisement cautioning parents aboutthe use of pesticides on fruits and their potential effects onchildren.   The group has bought time on a Washington television station forthe ad and plans to distribute it elsewhere around the country as apublic service announcement, said a spokesman, David Fenton.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><TEXT>   EDITORS:   The group also has established a telephone hotline for moreinformation including a taped message from the actress.
