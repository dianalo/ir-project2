Kelso Americold Inc., a new company formed by Kelso andamp; Co., a New York investment banking firm specializing in leveraged buyouts, also will assume Americold's debt, Beatrice said. It wouldn't say how much debt will be assumed.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowings. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
