<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-79-0016 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the FRG extensive analyses of possible Accident Management measuresare performed. The presented results of these analyses show that thereis a great potential for the operators to avoid core melt by flexibleuse of existing or slightly modified systems. Decisions have been madeon Accident Management measures to prevent containment failures due tooverpressurization of the containment (filtered venting for PWR's andBWR's); to prevent containment failures due to hydrogen burn (inertingBWR containments); and increasing battery capacity for 2-3 hours. Measuresunder discussion are, e.g., catalytic foils to prevent an increase ofhydrogen concentration in PWR containments; secondary and primary bleedand feed for PWR's; and diverse use of systems to restore the core coolantinventory and decay heat removal (e.g. by fire fighting system). Theobjective of all theses measures is a further decrease of core melt frequencyand to limit considerably the consequences in case of a core melt. Themain future activities will be the development and validation of accidentmanagement measures as well as a more detailed analysis of the systemcapabilities. In addition, the appropriateness of instrumentation willbe further assessed and diagnostic tools improved. An appropriate proceduredescription and training will be prepared.</TEXT></DOC>
