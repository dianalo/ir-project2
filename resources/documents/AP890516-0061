That startling observation seems to contradict what almost everyAmerican knows _ so oft is it repeated _ that in the 1980s we haveachieved what is said to be the longest peacetime expansion of thecentury.   The statements don't conflict. The expansion, now in its 77thmonth, may be unmatched in persistence but not in accomplishment,because so far in the 1980s the U.S. economy has grown at an annualaverage of just 2.5 percent.   That message was delivered recently to the Hartford Society ofFinancial Analysts by John Winthrop Wright, whose approach toinvesting might be called classical or fundamental but who in theseodd times finds himself a contrarian.   An economic or investment contrarian is one who sees thingsdifferently, and who seeks to use that different perspective toprotect himself from the madness of the popular mind, such as inextolling the great expansion.   A tenet of Wright's philosophy, and of the company he founded,Wright Investors' Service, Bridgeport, Conn., is to take the longperspective lest you be swept into the latest fad or phobia andthereby lose your perspective.   That is why he suggests we take a decade-long look at theeconomy rather than lose our minds to the latest figures. Hesuggests that 77 straight monthly gains in gross national productfigures may have created a false impression.   It is true, he said, that the 1982 recession depressed thedecade's figures, and that since that time the economy has grown ata 4 percent rate. But so what? How many decades have escaped arecession? None.   Of course, Wright continuued, the 1970s weren't that greateither. After 30 years of economic growth averaging more than 4percent a year, the country has been growing at just around 2.5percent a year for nearly 20 years.   Furthermore, he said, ``we've had to work harder to get whatmeager growth we've gotten.'' That is, the country has had to put agreater proportion of its population to work in order to maintainstandards to which we're accustomed.   For example, two of every three civilians are now in the laborforce, and a record 63 percent of civilians are working, up from 59percent at the beginning of the decade. Most households havemultiple breadwinners now.   In other words, said Wright, real gross national product and percapita GNP have remained close to the trendline growth in recentyears only as a result of putting an increasing percentage of thepopulation to work.   Real GNP per worker is still below the long-term trend line. Inreal terms, with inflation wrung out, hourly earnings are no higherthan they were 15 years ago.   Little wonder, said Wright, that like the Red Queen from ``Alicein Wonderland,'' many families feel as if they have to run fasterjust to stay in place.   Wright's purpose in describing his perspective was not todisparage the accomplishments of those who helped keep the economyexapnding, but to ask a few questions about the manner in which itis now being led.   Specifically, why has the Federal Reserve pushed up interestrates?   ``Our view,'' he said, ``is that the underlying trend ofinflation is still under good control and that inflation isprobably now close to its peak rate for the current businesscycle.''   We should be reminded, he said, that the United States has along history of moderate inflation, averaging just over 3 percentfor the 20th century to date. It is always around, if not as areality then as a threat.   ``Slowing the U.S. economy when it is hardly booming seems astrange way to deal with inflation caused by bad weather and thehigher cost of both domestic capital and imported products,'' hesaid.   Sooner or later, he concluded, the Federal Reserve will ``seethe error of its ways in trying to beat down the entire economy inorder to offset price pressures which are beyond its control.''</TEXT></DOC>
