At the same time, he said, inflation remains athreat both in the U.S. and abroad. He termed &quot;disappointing&quot;last week's report that consumer prices shot up 0.5% inMarch. And he said that easier credit conditions in WesternEurope outside Germany may stimulate demand for U.S. exports,possibly resulting in inflationary pressure from overseas.</LP><TEXT>   He gave no clue on the crucial question of timing, notingthat the warm weather earlier this year makes it difficult toget an accurate reading of the underlying pace of the economyand that the consumer price report may have been distorted bya surge in apparel prices. &quot;This is a period to be cautious,&quot;he said.   Mr. Johnson's views are important because he is a crucialswing vote in Fed decisions at the moment. The financialmarket indicators that Mr. Johnson and others watchintensively don't appear to signal any urgency. Long-terminterest rates in the bond market are up, but the dollar isrelatively stable when viewed against currencies of all U.S.trading partners -- not just Japan -- and commodity pricesare mixed.   Mr. Johnson also said he and other Fed officials don'tobject to international intervention in currency markets tosupport the yen so long as such efforts don't turn into aworld-wide campaign against the dollar.   After gradually pushing down short-term interest rates forsix months, the Fed paused at the end of December and hasbeen resisting pressure from the administration and others tolower them further. Fed officials say the behavior of theeconomy in the past four months vindicates their stance. Theeconomy has bounced back from its fourth-quarter languor.Inflation hasn't abated. Bond yields, seen by some as ameasure of inflation expectations, have risen.   In a separate interview last week, Robert Parry, presidentof the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, said the currentpace of the U.S. economy is too rapid to make much dent inthe inflation rate. He put the annual growth pace at slightlyabove 2%, after inflation.   Although Mr. Parry expects prices to rise more slowly inthe coming months than they did in the first quarter, hestill predicts inflation will be higher this year than lastyear. &quot;That's uncomfortable and unacceptable,&quot; he said. ButMr. Parry, who is among the Fed's staunchest foes ofinflation, added, &quot;At this point, I am not willing to say weought to aim for a recession to produce faster adjustment&quot; inthe inflation rate.   In recent months, the Fed and the Treasury have clashedover the Treasury's eagerness to intervene in currencymarkets to push down the dollar. But Mr. Johnson said the Fedis prepared to support intervention to support the weak yenprovided other countries use their own currencies -- not justthe dollar -- to buy yen. &quot;I've never objected tointervention to support the yen, but that has been translatedinto general dollar sales,&quot; he stated.   At the recent meeting of finance ministers and centralbankers from the seven largest industrial countries, WestGermany reportedly resisted Japanese entreaties that it spendmarks to support the yen. As a result, the U.S. was unwillingto agree to stepped-up intervention.   Mr. Johnson emphasized the importance of coordinatingeconomic policies internationally, and he expressedreservations about the current state of the coordinationprocess. &quot;I worry that it could flounder; I think it needssome energy,&quot; he said. The formal coordination mechanism isthe Group of Seven, which includes finance ministers andcentral bankers from the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,Britain, Canada and Italy.   ---   Hilary Stout contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
