On the last day of the term, the court upheld the couple's right to keep the government off their property.    The ACLU's cramped view of civil rights ignores the economic rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights. For about 50 years until this term, the Supreme Court did too. But if Justice Antonin Scalia pursues the reasoning he used in this case, we predict a renaissance for property rights.    His opinion in Nollan v. California Coastal Commission rejuvenated the Fifth Amendment prohibition against private property being &quot;taken for public use, without just compensation.&quot; California told the Nollans that if they wanted a building permit to replace their dilapidated bungalow with a new house, they'd have to give the public access to their beach. The Nollans didn't think they should have to lose some of the value of their property to rebuild their house.    Justices Scalia, Rehnquist, White, O'Connor and -- court ideology buffs take note -- Powell held that states can regulate the size of houses under the police power, but can't mix apples and oranges. Public access to the beach has nothing to do with building codes. Instead, this was a taking that would require compensation. The newest justice wrote that if California &quot;wants an easement across the Nollans' property, it must pay for it.&quot;    Property-rights cases became rare when liberal judges deemed some rights more equal than others. These judges made their standards of review depend on the right at issue -- with the right to property getting little protection. The Constitution nowhere says that some rights are more or less fundamental than others. Justice Scalia announced that the activist judge-emperors have no clothes:    &quot;There is no reason to believe . . . that so long as the regulation of property is at issue the standards for takings challenges, due process challenges and equal protection challenges are identical; any more than there is any reason to believe that so long as the regulation of speech is at issue the standards for due process challenges, equal protection challenges, and First Amendment challenges are identical.&quot;    This case could have implications well beyond the Nollans' new house. Several cities condition development permits for apartments on set asides for low-income tenants. New Jersey's Mount Laurel case mandates that each city set aside low-income housing. These also may amount to takings of property.    It's worth noting that one reason the government gets so involved in zoning is to fix problems created by other regulations. Rent control reduces the amount of low-cost housing and, in places such as New York City, prices even middle-class renters out of the market. But two wrongs do not make a constitutional right. Next term, the Supreme Court will rule on a San Jose rent-control law that forces landlords to charge less rent to lower-income tenants. A freer property market will expand, not contract, housing opportunities for the poor.    The Founders agreed with John Locke's view that property is a natural right that the government can't usurp. Property is as important as free speech or habeas corpus.    Time has shown the practical wisdom of this philosophy. The commercial republic became the economic wonder of the world by protecting owners' rights to use property as they wish. Regulators should think twice before forcing more owners to court. </TEXT></DOC>
