(products).andO;Product:   Statgraphics 4.0 (Statistical software).andO;Topic:     Software packagesStatistical SoftwareEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>STSC Inc.andM;STATGRAPHICS 4.0andM;With two substantial binders of documentation, Statgraphics offers functionsranging from simple plots through quality-control analysis, time series andeven linear programming.andM;The full-screen, panel-oriented input is more flexible than the sequentialdialogue of the RS/1 commands.andP;  Statgraphics was faster than RS/1 as well,and can generate presentation-quality charts directly from its results.andP;  Theprogram can overlay plots and perform an on-screen slide show, as well asdrive a wide range of hard-copy output devices.andM;Statgraphics has a powerful mind, but its body sometimes gets in the way.andO;For example, the program will not accept a full path specification as inputto the &quot;import file&quot; command.andP;  Instead, the path must be changed as part of adifferent command that controls the system environment.andM;When a command field offers multiple options, the user selects one by typingits first letter.andP;  This is only slightly more convenient than a command line-- the user still needs to remember the options.andM;Statgraphics does not connect its various analyses as easily as the three Macproducts.andP;  After a table had just been imported, moving straight to the plotcommand did not produce defaults to plot that data; instead, the variablenames created by Statgraphics for the table had to be re-entered for theplot.andP;  When a regression was performed, however, Statgraphics did offer aconvenient pop-up menu of related reports.andM;STSC Inc., of Rockville, Md., can be reached at (301) 984-5000.andM;----------Buyers say .andP;  .  .andM;&quot;I perform design experiments and process analysis studies,&quot; said RichardBell, senior process technician for PPG Industries Inc., a manufacturer ofwindshields in Creighton, Pa.andP;  &quot;Statgraphics is my workhorse package forpoints data analysis.&quot;andM;Statgraphics has a &quot;full range of experimental design features,&quot; he said,&quot;with six different kinds of regression analysis, five kinds of analysis ofvariance and all kinds of multivariate plots.&quot;andM;Although the product is menu-driven, a command option is also available, saidBell.andP;  By using F8 followed by a command, a user can execute almost any menuoption, he said.andM;&quot;It is based on APL, which is a slow language, but I have not found the[performance] to be burdensome,&quot; said Bell, who uses Statgraphics on an IBMModel 80 with a 300M-byte hard disk.andP;  &quot;When I was running an AT you could goget a cup of coffee between calculations.&quot;andM;According to Bell, the Statgraphics editor in the data-management section hasa valuable split-files feature that allows a user to split off a segment ofdata into a new file for further manipulation.andM;Bill Kochevar, senior quality engineer for 3M Data Storage Products inCamarillo, Calif., uses the product for on-site consulting and analysis ofdesign experiments.andM;Although it might be six months between uses of certain analyses, Kochevarsaid, the menu-driven interface allows him to simply select a function andfill in the blanks on the screen.andM;According to Kochevar, the product does not support Epson America Inc.'s24-pin LQ series printer.andM;&quot;The GSS LQ driver has a glitch in it and won't work, but STSC is working onit,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;All your plots come out a third bigger than the page.&quot;andM;</TEXT></DOC>
