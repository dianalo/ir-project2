But footing the bill for the ``Safe Streets, Safe City'' programwould mean a hike in property taxes, a payroll tax and a 25-centsurcharge on lottery tickets sold in the city, Mayor David Dinkinssaid.   ``We will flood the streets with an army of police officers. ...Our war against fear will return peace to our communities, leavingus with safe streets, in a safe city,'' Dinkins said in a City Hallspeech.   The plan follows a summer of bad publicity and stingingcriticism about the city's escalating violence. If approved, itwould put the most officers on the force in the city's history.   Among the more noteworthy cases were a number of children hit bystray bullets, the Zodiac gunman who apparently picked his victimsby birthdates, repeated killings of cab drivers, the killing of aprosecutor near the Bronx courthouse and the fatal stabbing of atourist who was defending his mother during a subway mugging.   The proposal would need approval from the City Council and thestate Legislature. In Albany, Republican opposition threatened thepayroll tax part of the package, which would apply to out-of-towncommuters who work in the city, as well as residents.   Assembly Speaker Mel Miller said he had some doubts about theconstitutionality of the proposed surcharge on lottery tickets.   If given the legislative go-ahead, the plan would not kick infor at least another six months while potential new police officerswere trained. And with the Police Academy operating at top volume,it would take 18 months to get the proposed 7,931 new officerswalking a beat or riding a subway car.   Key elements of the Dinkins proposal include 2,950 new jail bedsat Rikers Island, $420 million for educational programs to preventpupils from dropping out and turning to crime, assignment of a copto every train at night, and a 54 percent increase in the number ofpolice on patrol each day.   ``Fear is the ugliest of emotions,'' Dinkins said. ``Unchecked,it may become the greatest criminal of all.''   The plan would mean more cops walking beats. Dinkins wants thehiring of 1,626 civilians to free officers from desk duty,elimination of certain units, and assignment of other agencies tocertain emergencies, such as heart attacks.   The plan calls for a property tax hike that would cost theaverage single family homeowner $20 more per year, and a payrolltax that would cost a taxpayer who earned $50,000 annually about $1per week the first year and $1.50 the next.</TEXT></DOC>
