ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration said Monday it may roll the space shuttle Atlantisback from its seaside launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center inFlorida if hurricane Hugo continues to pose a threat.   NASA spokeswoman Sarah Keegan said preparations also were beingmade to remove a satellite from an Atlas-Centaur rocket which hadbeen scheduled for launch on Friday.   She said a final decision was to be made Tuesday morning on bothspace vehicles after a weather briefing.   Atlantis is scheduled to be launched Oct. 12 with the Galileospace probe in its cargo bay. The five astronauts on the flight areto release the probe and send it on a six-year voyage to the planetJupiter.   The space probe is powered by a small nuclear generator.   ``We are starting preparations'' to pull Atlantis back into therelative safety of its hangar in the giant Vehicle AssemblyBuilding, Miss Keegan said. ``We decided to take preliminary stepsif they decide to roll back tomorrow.''   A return to the hangar would certainly mean a delay in thelaunch, but NASA has an opportunity to send the probe on its wayuntil late November.   The payload on top of the Atlas-Centaur rocket is the last of aseries of communications satellites for the Navy.   On Monday, the hurricane hit Puerto Rico with 125 mph winds, asit moved across islands in the eastern Caribbean, killing 14 peopleand leaving thousands homeless.   By evening on Monday the center of the hurricane was 90 milesnorthwest of San Juan and was moving at 13 mph in a directionvarying from west-northwest to northwest.   Forecasters have said it was too early to tell whether thehurricane would strike the U.S. mainland.</TEXT></DOC>
