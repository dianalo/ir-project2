The operation will cap the extensive restructuring, begun in January, of the Ferruzzi group, Italy's second-largest private-sector industrial conglomerate.    Montedison said it sent a draft prospectus of its proposed placement of Ferruzzi Finanziaria shares to Consob, the Italian securities-exchange regulatory agency. Montedison and a subsidiary own about 34% of Ferruzzi Finanziaria, the parent company of the Ravenna-based agro-industrial empire run by Raul Gardini, which in turn holds a controlling stake of 42% in chemical producer Montedison.    &quot;We expect to see a prospectus by the end of October,&quot; said one Milan investment banker, &quot;and the operation should come shortly after.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
