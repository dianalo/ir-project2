Besides boasting &quot;the most powerful air conditioner in the world,&quot; mightier even than the one in the U.S. Capitol, and the horticultural artistry of &quot;the Hanging Gardens of Bergen,&quot; the mall claimed state-of-the-art credit convenience. A &quot;teletype hookup&quot; between the county credit bureau and Bamburger's department store, it was stated, &quot;will enable customers to open up charge accounts in a short and efficient manner.&quot;    In their wildest dreams, Garden State Plaza's developers could never have foreseen the efficient temple of consumption their mall would one day become. Back then, in malldom's infancy, few envisioned how expertly television's siren song would unleash cravings to be satisfied with the flick of a magnetically coded plastic card, or how malls would proliferate in response.    But at the time, the country was just beginning the world's most ambitious roadbuilding effort since Imperial Rome's -- the Interstate Highway System. It came with a mall-nourishing network of belts, loops, bypasses, feeders and interchanges. Since then, malls have become icons of contemporary culture, a felicitous -- and probably inevitable -- marriage of automobile and television.    The number of U.S. shopping centers has burgeoned from 2,000 in 1957 to more than 30,000 today, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. In 1987, they generated $584 billion in retail sales, or 54% of the nation's total nonautomotive retail trade. Their growth has imposed a uniformity on the landscape, blurring regional distinctions in a homogenized chainstore sprawl from coast to coast. Put yourself in any mall anywhere, and you might as well be in California.    But the malls have become much more than hubs of commerce: With most Main Streets and village greens relegated to the status of quaint relics, the malls have become places to hang out -- to relieve loneliness, alienation or boredom.    &quot;Malls provide what little civic identity exists in the suburbs,&quot; says Mark Baldassare, professor of sociology at the University of California at Irvine. &quot;They are places to go -- if not to meet people, then to see other people, to feel you are a part of things.&quot;    Garden State Plaza, built in Paramus, N.J., on 102 acres of marshy farmland at the crossroads of two state highways, once billed itself the &quot;world's largest shopping center.&quot; Though it long ago lost the title, it remains imposing: an enclosed, climate-controlled agglomeration of 132 retail stores encircled by 7,800 parking spaces. All but a handful of the original stores are gone, and like some other American shopping centers, Garden State recently passed into foreign hands. An Australian mall developer, Westfield Holdings Ltd. of Sydney, purchased it from a division of R.H. Macy andamp; Co. in 1986, and now manages it through its Los Angeles-based subsidiary, Westfield Inc.    Garden State's merchants ring up some $350 million in sales a year. In the five weeks before Christmas last year, well over two million people came to buy or simply gape at its treasures: espresso machines and designer chocolates, scrimshaw and running shoes, bonsai trees, telephones, crystal bric-a-brac, not to mention football fields full of ready-to-wear.    Retailers here -- including Macy's, J.C. Penney and Hahne's department stores -- court shoppers from the surrounding affluent bedroom communities of New York City, 10 miles to the east, and even from the city itself. Paul Bacon, the mall's affable, 39-year-old manager, calls them &quot;the I-want-what-I-want-when-I-want-it type of customer.&quot;    Marian Murray of Saddle River, N.J., seems typical. The stylish brunette says, &quot;I have to buy something every week. I could shop every day. I think stores should set up cots so you could take nap breaks and start all over again.&quot;    Patrons of this pleasure dome have a glazed, distracted look about them. Their subdued chatter drowns out neither the Muzak nor the splash of the fountains. The international Food Court, serving up a melting pot of fast food, approximates a municipal park. Here, a couple of Madonna lookalikes in seven-inch dangling earrings nibble pizza beside a businessman deeply immersed in a baseball book. Toddlers scamper beside manicured beds of philodendron. Old people measure out their mornings over Styrofoam coffee cups. &quot;Whadya buy?&quot; brays one lady, spotting a friend and joining her table, eager for details.    Should a napkin or cigarette butt besmirch the tiled floor, a uniformed attendant promptly whisks it up. A high-profile security detail fosters the illusion of serenity and well-being.    Garden State regulars may drop by as often as once or twice a week, finding amusement or banishing boredom in the pursuit of goods. &quot;Shopping is my hobby,&quot; says Elissa Geller, a housewife from Fort Lee. Maria Isnardi, a pharmacy student, also ranks shopping among her favorite pastimes. &quot;Every day I come I see something different,&quot; she says, adding: &quot;If you're by yourself, there's not a lot of things to do -- shopping is one of them. I wouldn't go bowling alone.&quot;    One day recently, shoppers had come to the mall, among other reasons, to briefly forget a husband's illness; to amuse their preschool children; to kill an unexpected day off; to celebrate a birthday, and to replenish belongings lost when a house burned down. Susan Walzer, a visiting engineer from Israel, declares the mall &quot;heaven.&quot; She brought three empty suitcases along on a visit to her family in New Jersey. They are now full of her purchases, she reports. Pointing to her four-year-old daughter, Mrs. Walzer laughs and says, &quot;She thinks America is one big shopping mall.&quot;    Men are in the minority here at the mall, and most of them can be found lounging on benches that line the promenades, reading newspapers or staring blankly into space. One elderly man is greeted by two women acquaintances: &quot;Where's your wife?&quot; they ask. &quot;Shopping around?&quot; He nods and smiles sheepishly, as if to say, &quot;Where else?&quot; Kenneth Meyer of Jersey City paces while his wife disappears into a store. &quot;I'm just the chauffeur,&quot; he says. &quot;We're married 50 years, and I must have spent half that time waiting for her in shopping centers.&quot;    Maintaining Garden State's 1,204,000 square feet of leasable space to spit-and-polish standard is a tall order. &quot;When you think about it, we're running a small city here,&quot; Mr. Bacon says.    Even in the weeks between the Christmas and Easter seasons -- the dog days of retailing -- Mr. Bacon was busy juggling his time and his priorities to satisfy his many constituencies. He conferred with local fire inspectors about safety codes for next Christmas. The mayor of Paramus called about the high-school graduation party, which the mall is subsidizing to the tune of $9,000. Easter decorations went up in one all-night marathon, and plans were laid for the Easter bunny's arrival -- an event that would draw 900 spectators. Looming over all was the groundbreaking for a $30 million, 60-store expansion, requiring the pre-Easter relocation of Mr. Bacon's own offices and 100 employees to temporary quarters in the parking lot.    On his desk, there were budgets to prepare and insurance interrogatories to answer. (At least one &quot;slip and fall&quot; claim is pending at any given time; insurance has become nearly as big a cost for malls as utilities.) There were lost children to be located, sick shoppers to be resuscitated, and neighbors like Virginia Androvett, whose home stands behind the mall, to mollify. &quot;The wind blows debris from the mall into our yards,&quot; she gripes. &quot;It's a disgrace.&quot;    Mr. Bacon spearheaded a neighborhood cleanup and has erected fences to contain rubbish. But overall the 60 tons of litter the mall generates each week create a perpetual headache. The mall runs through 70,000 garbage bags a year. The new management's deep pockets and its willingness, as Paramus Mayor Joseph Cipolla puts it, to &quot;give back to the community&quot; greatly temper litter and traffic issues. Not only does the town reap more than $1 million a year in taxes from Garden State, but it also has found the mall receptive to its entreaties for donations for civic projects. &quot;They've given us anything we've asked for,&quot; Mayor Cipolla says with satisfaction.    All this, of course, is subsidiary to the mall's principal mission, that of moving merchandise. Retailers pay dearly for a piece of what the mall management likes to call &quot;one of the best locations in America,&quot; where two million people live within a 10-mile radius. New leases are going for $35 to $70 per square foot. And once a tenant reaches an individually negotiated &quot;breakpoint&quot; in sales, he returns anywhere from 5% to 10% of additional revenue to the mall. Merchants also pay monthly fees for maintenance and promotion.    Small room for laid-back, mom-and-pop stores here. All but the most successful of independent entrepreneurs are priced out of the mall. Though officials of Westfield, the mall's owner, insist they seek a &quot;local presence,&quot; most of its tenants are chains. &quot;When an independent gets sick, he dies,&quot; says an independent retailer who asks not to be identified. &quot;The chains are perpetual.&quot;    To justify the rents they pay, merchants are compelled to squeeze maximum profit from their allotted space. Gia Tomiano, the manager of California Girl, a bathing-suit boutique, sets sales goals for her clerks, whose starting pay is slightly above the minimum wage. A new employee is expected to sell $75 worth of merchandise an hour, moving to $100 an hour after three months. &quot;I'm on their backs constantly,&quot; she says, &quot;just as authority is always on my back.&quot; Her shop, part of an eight-store chain that began on the boardwalk at Rehoboth Beach, Del., does a $1 million-a-year business at Garden State.    Competitive pressure discourages camaraderie. The manager of another sportswear shop says he sees few employees of other stores socially. Friendly overtures, he says, are sometimes mistaken for foreplay to recruiting raids, a common practice that springs from chronic labor shortages.    For retailers, regimentation is part of the price of admission. They are bound by their leases to remain open 72 hours a week -- six nights until 9:30. (County blue laws keep the center closed on Sundays.) Store designs and signs must meet rigorous standards of consistency.    Outwardly, there seems little resentment. &quot;You have to go with the times,&quot; says Jerry Healy, a shoe-store manager who works six days and three nights a week. &quot;This is my livelihood, what I chose. I make a nice income -- $40,000 plus bonus. You can't go into this with one eye open.&quot;    Insecurity, however, lurks beneath the surface. Merchants do find the new management's accessibility and interest in their problems refreshing. But they are unsettled by the mall expansion, and worry about its effect on their stores. One tenant has heard of a retailer at a nearby mall who, when his lease expired, was told that his allotted square footage was being cut in half, take it or leave it. &quot;You are at the mercy of the landlord,&quot; the tenant laments.    A mall is not only an economic entity but also a community center. Thus its management must continually grapple with broader social issues, the stickiest of which is how to control political petitioning and other activities unrelated to shopping. &quot;There's a general misconception that malls are public property,&quot; says August Scarfarotti, Westfield's eastern regional manager. &quot;They are a place of public assembly, but they are private property.&quot;    In a decision that established prevailing policy, the U.S. Supreme Court in 1980 held that California could require public access to a shopping center for political petitioning, under reasonable rules and regulations. But the decision effectively bucked the issue back to state courts, and the situation is still muddled.    Garden State has a booth where community groups may distribute information after applying in writing for a permit. Fund raising isn't permitted, though groups can apply for a share in the $600 or so in coins retrieved from the mall's fountains each month.    On a recent weekday, the National Guard was recruiting at the booth. &quot;Today, there's nothing offensive&quot; about such activities, says Debra Gilson, the mall's marketing director. &quot;But if one customer complained, we'd have to step in.&quot; Recently, she recalls, the mall required a right-to-life group to stop showing videotapes of abortions.    The University of California's Mr. Baldassare sees the regulation of mall access and political activity as part of a general drift toward privatization. Instead of parks and streets open to all, he says, people now buy into gated communities complete with private security, swimming clubs and greenbelts. He finds this distressing. &quot;As people become more insular,&quot; he says, &quot;it heightens the alienation of those who don't fit into the mainstream. It locks them out of a community life.&quot;    Nonetheless, most Garden State shoppers seem comfortable in the hermetic shell. And shopping is only part of the attraction. One regular who can't tolerate hot weather saves on air-conditioning bills by spending summer afternoons here. Phyllis Salma of River Edge, N.J., comes to walk two miles a day. &quot;Mornings are dreary at home,&quot; she says. &quot;I can't stay in.&quot;    A Head Start preschool group visits on a field trip one morning, surveying the plants at a garden store before munching box lunches at parasoled tables in the Food Court. In keeping with its expanding role as a suburban cultural center, the mall stages frequent entertainments, from aerobic dance competitions to performances by the Rockettes.    Among the elderly who gossip over morning coffee in the Food Court, the talk often turns to crime. The other day, reports Helen Garretsen of Paterson, N.J., a &quot;scraggly&quot; man snatched a woman's purse in the mall. He was apprehended, she says, but &quot;it took three guys to put him down.&quot; Still, she says, &quot;I figure I'm safer here than at home sometimes.&quot;    Paramus police respond to 10 to 15 calls a day at the mall, according to Chief Joseph Delaney. Two plainclothesmen are stationed on the mall roof at all times to watch the parking area. This didn't help one luckless man, whose Mercedes-Benz and BMW were both stolen from the lot in separate Christmas-season incidents. Mr. Bacon says the irate shopper demanded that the mall erect a fence around the entire parking lot, and post guards at every entrance.    ---   Ms. Graham is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.    ---                    Americans' Use of Time    Preliminary figures from an unpublished study (1985-87) of 5,000 Americans    ACTIVITY                        HOURS SPENT EACH WEEK    TV viewing                                17.0    Eating                                     7.9    Shopping (includes travel time)            5.7    Cooking                                    4.5    Recreation/excercise                       2.9    Housecleaning                              2.8    Church/civic work                          1.9    Gardening/pet care                         0.7    Source: John P.
