In a 6-2 decision, the court said people who intervene on theside of defendants in civil rights cases _ but who themselves arenot found to have violated anyone's rights _ generally cannot beforced to reimburse the lawyer fees incurred by those whosuccessfully sue.   The complicated case stems from a lawsuit filed 19 years ago thatchallenged TWA's policy of firing female flight attendants when theybecame mothers.   The suit was resolved in 1979 when TWA agreed to reinstate firedwomen, and grant them seniority from the date of their dismissal.   The airline, which had abandoned its ``no motherhood'' policysoon after the suit was filed, also created a $3 million fund forthe fired attendants.   The settlement was challenged by the Independent Federation ofFlight Attendants on behalf of TWA flight attendants who could havesuffered by being laid off before those with the newly won seniority.   The union acted in the case as an intervenor, a concerned thirdparty not named as a plaintiff or defendant.   The union's challenge to the settlement ultimately failed, andthe 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year ordered the union topay $180,915 toward the legal fees incurred by the female flightattendants who sued.   But the Supreme Court said today that the appeals court wronglypresumed that the union was liable under a federal law allowingcourts to make such lawyer-fee awards.   Such intervenors are liable under that law, Justice AntoninScalia wrote for the court, only when their intervention is``frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation.''   The court sent the case back to the 7th Circuit for further study.   Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan dissented, andJustice John Paul Stevens did not participate in the case.   The case is Independent Federation of Flight Attendants vs.Zipes, 88-608.</TEXT></DOC>
