The water line begins about two miles up the road, where three dozenmen stand quietly waiting to fill 10-gallon jugs from a trickling pipe. Gaslines last week stretched upward of a mile. There is no more rice. There areno vegetables, no fruit, no meat, no batteries, no milk, no cooking or heatinggas.;    Most Kuwaitis haven't had a hot bath in two weeks. There is no waterfor laundry or dish washing or flushing toilets. There are few telephones andno television. Families huddle together in their living rooms at night overhomemade candles or venture outside into an intimidating landscape of utterdarkness.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  KUWAIT'S URBAN REFUGEES HIT BY PERVASIVESHORTAGES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  War in the GulfSee also related stories on pages 1A, 6A-8A in this section  </MEMO><TEXT>     Kuwait, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, has become a land ofurban refugees, and conditions have never been worse than during the two weekssince the country was liberated from its Iraqi occupiers.;    &quot;Seven monthsthe Iraqis were here, and we find anything we want. Now, the government comesback and we have nothing,&quot; fumed Haladi Ibrahim Manaai, who spent most of thepast two days waiting in various lines without finding milk for her 31/2-month-old baby. &quot;When everything is finished, I will give the Kuwaitisthis ID card and I will leave the country.&quot;;    &quot;My wife just now ispregnant,&quot; said Khalid Saffar, a 28-year-old police officer. &quot;I can't find forher any food. Just she eats biscuit in the morning, biscuit in the afternoon,biscuit for dinner. Before, we had the bad man Saddam (Hussein), but at leastwe had food.&quot;;    Kuwait's exiled government and its allied advisers hadanticipated they would be able to restore many basic services with relativespeed to the 350,000 people still living in the capital. But now, two weeksafter the invaders were driven out, officials have only just begun to realizethe massive scope of the damage done by Iraqi troops.;    &quot;From what we'velearned, it appears that the Iraqis when they left had plans to demolish thecity in a manner like Warsaw in 1944,&quot; said Col. Randall Elliott, head of theKuwait Task Force, a U.S. group assigned to aid the Kuwaiti government inreconstructing the country. &quot;They were vandals with military equipment, andthe destruction has been enough to seriously impair the functioning of thiscity.&quot;;    Power lines between Kuwait City and the closest fully functioninggenerating plant, 43 miles south at Ras al Zour, are broken in 93 places.Sewage treatment plants are not functioning, dumping raw sewage into thePersian Gulf, and 55-gallon barrels of toxic chemicals were placed inlocations that military officials say indicate an attempt was made to poisonthe water supply.;    Many telephone and electrical substations and switchingstations were blown up, as were portions of the two major power-generating anddesalination plants in Kuwait City. More than 530 oil wells are on fire,burning 5 million barrels of oil a day and sending into the air plumes of foulsmoke that have already lowered the temperature in Kuwait an average of 10degrees. Hospitals have been stripped, television and radio facilities looted,hotels set afire.;    With little apparent progress so far in restoringservices, tensions in the capital have increased markedly, and hostilitytoward the returning government is building. The number of checkpoints on theroads has nearly doubled in the past few days.;    &quot;I think they're (Kuwaitiofficials) afraid, and I think they have reason to be. The frustration isgrowing a lot faster than the services are,&quot; said a source close to theKuwaiti government.;    Kuwaiti officials admit it has taken much longer torestore services than they had originally anticipated, but they say they havebeen delayed by trying to assess precisely where the damage is -- and by thefact that in some cases the damage is worse than they had feared.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Kuwait City  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910312  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  685  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday March 12, 199100072024,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
