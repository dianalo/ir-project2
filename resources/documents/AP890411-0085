(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lawmakers have passed a requirement for aseven-day waiting period and criminal background checks for buyersof assault weapons.   Gov. William Donald Schaefer is expected to sign the bill,passed late Monday in the closing hours of the 1989 GeneralAssembly session.   Under the measure, State Police would check the background of aprospective gun buyer for evidence the individual was a drugaddict, alcoholic, convicted felon or was mentally deranged. Anindividual with such a background can be denied a gun.   Purchases of 24 semiautomatic handguns and rifles are affected.   Earlier in the 90-day session, legislators considered banningthe sale of semiautomatics altogether.   Last year, Maryland banned cheap handguns known as SaturdayNight Specials.   Lawmakers have been continued pressure from the National RifleAssociation, which is worried the state is stepping on citizens'rights to own guns.   Lawmakers around the nation turned their attention tosemiautomatic weapons after a drifter opened fire on a Stockton,Calif., schoolyard in January with an AK-47 rifle and killed fivechildren before committing suicide.</TEXT></DOC>
