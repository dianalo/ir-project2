Unlike recent years, when the day was marked by violent clashesbetween police and anti-government demonstrators, Poles observedthe holiday Thursday by returning to a tradition of parades, churchservices and family outings.   The holiday marks the anniversary of Poland's 1791 democraticconstitution, Europe's first written constitution.   ``I'm very happy that this day has come back,'' said a smilingDariusz Chmielewski, joined by his wife and 8-year-old son onWarsaw's Victory Square, where an army band dressed in red, whiteand blue 17th-century uniforms performed before about 2,000 people.   ``We have been waiting for this for a long time and it hasfinally come true,'' he said.   The May 3 holiday commemorates Poland's short-lived attempt in1791 to avoid Russian domination by establishing a government basedon a liberal constitution.   Four years later, the country was swallowed up by its powerfulneighbors _ Russia, Austria and Prussia _ and disappeared from themap of Europe for 123 years.   After Poland regained its independence in 1918, May 3 became thecountry's national day, equivalent to the American Fourth of July.But observances were banned after the 1939 Nazi invasion.   After the war, Poland's Communist government abolished theholiday and changed the national day to July 22, the anniversary ofthe 1944 proclamation of a pro-Moscow government.   In recent years, Communist authorities organized some officialobservances in an effort to coopt the holiday, but these wereovershadowed by the anti-government protests.   But last month, the new Solidarity-led government sponsoredlegislation to abolish July 22 as the national day and restore May3 to its official status.   Parliament approved the bill, and President Wojciech Jaruzelskisigned it into law one week ago.   The hasty enactment of the new official holiday caught manyPoles unaware, giving them an unexpected day off just after the May1 workers holiday, which is fast losing significance with thedemise of Communism.   Thursday's observances began with a flag-raising ceremony atWarsaw's Royal Castle attended by Jaruzelski, Prime MinisterTadeusz Mazowiecki and other officials.   Later at Victory Square, the military band entertained the crowdby performing military and church music as well as cabaret songsand even a bit of swing.   For Poles long used to ponderous official Communist ceremonies,the light-hearted music brought smiles and cheers.   They cheered again when Mazowiecki _ the former Solidarityadviser and political prisoner who formed Eastern Europe's firstnon-Communist government last August _ suddenly appeared on a smallplatform in their midst.   The prime minister, normally sad-faced, smiled and waved as heurged people to sing along to the music.   A Mass for the nation's leaders was held Thursday evening atWarsaw's St. John's Cathedral. In past years, police would forciblybreak up anti-government protests after May 3 services at thecathedral.   Elsewhere in Poland, tens of thousands of people took part in anoutdoor Mass in the southern shrine city of Czestochowa attended byCardinal Jozef Glemp, the Catholic primate. In recent years, theRoman Catholic Church has observed May 3 as a feast day honoringthe Virgin Mary.   At Victory Square, 76-year-old Janina Lebenstein recalled pastMay 3 celebrations before World War II when there were parades,little bars and buffets and dancing in the square.   ``We are happy to live to see this day,'' she said. ``It's notyet like it should be, but maybe next year it is going to bebeautiful.''</TEXT></DOC>
