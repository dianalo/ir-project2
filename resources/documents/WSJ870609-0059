MangunoStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FREST </IN><DATELINE> SEOUL, South Korea  </DATELINE><TEXT>   At precisely 2 p.m. tomorrow, 12,000 candidates and guests at the Democratic Justice Party's national convention will burst into shouts of celebration at the formal nomination of the party's chairman, Roh Tae Woo, as its candidate to succeed President Chun Doo Hwan. Waving signs and posters, they will chant &quot;glory to the president, cheers to the candidate, hope to the people.&quot;    At the same time, police are expected to confront anti-government rallies throughout South Korea -- rallies that they have vowed in advance to break up. &quot;The DJP doesn't intend to allow anything to spoil its show,&quot; says a national security official. &quot;It would prefer not to use force. But it will do so if necessary.&quot;    The ruling party is portraying Mr. Roh's nomination as a &quot;milestone in South Korea's march toward democracy.&quot; Indeed, tomorrow's convention will mark the first time in the republic's 39-year history that a presidential candidate is chosen in the presence of the incumbent.    But as the plans to stage demonstrations show, Mr. Roh and his party have a lot of mending to do in the months leading to the December presidential elections. Whether or not he can rise to the challenge, he has come across as more receptive and politically savvy than Mr. Chun -- qualities he will need if he wishes to unify his nation.    Korean headlines in recent days have described him as more &quot;relaxed,&quot; &quot;flexible&quot; and &quot;moderate&quot; than Mr. Chun. Political associates and foreign diplomats agree he seems more open to new ideas. &quot;Chun likes to talk. Roh prefers to listen, so he's less isolated than the president,&quot; says a government and party official.    This official and others consider Mr. Roh more politically astute than President Chun, and say his two years as chairman of the ruling party have been an invaluable lesson in the realities of Korean politics. &quot;Chun never had to struggle with politics,&quot; says a Western diplomat. &quot;He came in as a general, and he'll go out as a general. But Roh's understanding of politics&quot; has been formed by &quot;fighting with the most stubborn opponents any politician has ever come up against.&quot;    The 54-year-old Mr. Roh -- who is from Mr. Chun's home town of Taegu -- rose to power with the president in 1979 and has been at his side throughout the seven years of his rule. Both men were in the 11th class of the powerful Korea Military Academy -- a critical edge in a nation where personal allegiances are strongest among military-academy classmates. He is described by some intimates as President Chun's alter ego.    But he will bring to the job a resume that involves less military and more government experience. Not that his military background isn't impressive. Like many South Korean officers, he received training in the U.S. Among his military credits are a stint as a battalion commander in Vietnam, five years as commander of the Airborne Special Warfare Brigade and several months as commander of the 1st Division, one of Korea's principal fighting forces.    It was in that position that he made the crucial decision to send a regiment to support then-Gen. Chun's coup on Dec. 12, 1979, seven weeks after the assassination of President Park Chung Hee.    After formally taking power in 1980, Mr. Chun put Mr. Roh in charge of the Defense Security Command, the military-intelligence organ responsible for monitoring domestic politics as well as dissent within the military itself. Mr. Roh retired from the military, with the rank of full general, in 1981.    He has since served Mr. Chun in a variety of posts, among them minister of state for national security and foreign affairs and senior delegate to talks with North Korea. The fact that he has been retired from the military for six years, a Western diplomat says, &quot;means he has had a longer period to become 'civilianized' and used to the idea of democracy than Chun.&quot;    Still, his close association with Mr. Chun helped brand him, for some Koreans, as a collaborator in the brutal suppression of the 1980 civil insurrection in the southern city of Kwangju. His inability to fashion a compromise with opposition parties on revising the constitution in nine months of trying also has called into question his ability to govern with cooperation from all factions.    His first test on that issue will be whether he can persuade the opposition to field a candidate against him. The chief opposition party, the Reunification and Democracy Party led by Kim Young Sam, has vowed it won't participate in any election under the current constitution. It and the National Coalition for a Democratic Constitution, a newly formed alliance of religious and dissident groups, are organizing tomorrow's opposition rallies.    The government warns it will use maximum force to stop the &quot;illegal gatherings&quot; and has ordered what have become routine measures to prevent mass anti-government demonstrations. Tens of thousands of riot police have been mobilized to block or break up the gatherings. Authorities planned to place Mr. Kim and other opposition leaders under house arrest.    The convention already has been deflated by recent events that have hurt the government and embarrassed the party. Aside from President Chun's April decision to shelve efforts to revise the constitution, these episodes include:    --A partial cover-up of the police killing of 21-year-old Seoul National University student Park Chong Chul, and a foreign-exchange scandal involving the nation's largest shipping line.    --The subsequent replacement of the prime minister, five members of his cabinet and three other officials.    --International criticism over the trial of three Korean journalists for revealing the guidelines the government uses to control the domestic press. Two were freed on probation, and the third was acquitted last week.    &quot;We've been put on the defensive,&quot; says a ruling-party leader. &quot;But we are hoping to recoup our losses with the people by showing our candidate to be the fine leader he is.&quot;    Ruling-party officials say Mr. Roh is expected to make conciliatory gestures tothe opposition in his acceptance speech and elaborate on them at a Friday news conference.    Among his possible peace offerings, they say, are amnesty for large numbers of political prisoners and the restoration of their civil rights, promises of new moves toward democratization and a call for negotiation with the political opposition on new and fairer election laws.    But others who have watched and consulted with both sides in the political struggle say such gestures wouldn't amount to much and are unlikely to sway the opposition. Says a Western diplomat: &quot;Given the nature of the Korean opposition's all-or-nothing approach to politics and the ruling side's historical tendency to insist on finishing off the wounded opponent, conciliation is highly unlikely.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
