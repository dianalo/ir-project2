(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Pay Less By Buying More?andM;When a commercial sales representative offers to drop the price of a product5% if you buy an extra 100 units, you may wonder if the volume discount isreally worthwhile.andP;  The per-unit cost is lower, but what about the costs offinancing and storing the larger volume of units?andM;To find out if a volume discount is really a good deal, you must compare thesavings with the costs.andP;  A spreadsheet model, suitable for all currentreleases of 1-2-3 and Symphony, shows if the savings implicit in a volumediscount outweigh the costs of handling the extra stock.andM;The worksheet consists of an inputs section requiring eight entries and ananalysis section containing formulas that compute the net saving or lossrealized by taking a discount.andP;  These formulas simply add up the costs andthe savings and subtract the costs from the savings.andP;  A negative resultindicates a net loss.andP;  A positive result indicates a net saving.andM;But this approach is simplistic and in some marginal cases gives misleadingresults.andP;  A more complex method for determining the true economic effects oftaking a volume discount can be found in Production/Operations Management byWilliam J. Stevenson (2nd edition, 1986, Richard D. Irwin Inc., Homewood,Ill.).andM;Instead of taking this complex approach, we will take the simpler routedescribed above but will include a safety mechanism to show when thesavings-minus-cost formula yields misleading results.andP;  The safety mechanismis the economic order quantity (EOQ), the reorder amount that represents thebest balance between the cost of reordering frequently and the cost ofholding large inventories.andP;  The article &quot;How Many Should You Order?&quot; in theApril 1989 issue (page 62) discusses the EOQ in detail.andM;THE INPUTS SECTIONandM;There are eight values in the worksheet's Inputs section.andP;  The first inputvalue, demand period (cell D5), is the basis for all the other values in theInputs section.andP;  In the example shown in the figure below, that value is 30.andO;We follow the convention of basing financial calculations on a 360-day year,so the number 30 represents the days in one month.andM;Demand per period (cell D6) is the number of units used in the demand period.andO;The price per unit (cell D7) is the nondiscounted price of one unit.andP;  Forgoods that are packaged in quantity, such as screws or paper, either theprice per unit (one cent per screw) or the price per package is appropriate.andO;Be sure to use the same unit of measurement in determining values for thedemand per period and the discount order size.andM;Note that demand per period has nothing to do with the amount the company hasbeen ordering.andP;  Rather, it's the number of units used in a period.andP;  Thismodel uses the demand per period as a baseline amount to compute the costs ofacquiring and holding &quot;excess&quot; stock; it assumes that there is no financecost involved in purchasing the amount of stock that will be consumed in agiven period.andP;  The company more likely has been ordering an amount close tothe EOQ and must now consider taking advantage of the volume discount byordering a number of units specified by the vendor.andM;The order cost (cell D8) is the cost in time, materials, and overhead ofprocessing and receiving each order.andP;  This is usually the cost of updatingthe accounts-payable file clerical time, paperwork, and so on.andP;  The modelassumes that order cost doesn't vary with the number of units that areordered.andP;  Use the following rule of thumb to estimate order cost: Find outhow much clerical time is required to process a single order, double thatnumber to reflect overhead and management time, and multiply this by aclerk's hourly pay rate (including benefits).andM;The storage cost per period (cell D9) is the cost of insurance, light, heat,and other items based on the square feet occupied by each department.andP;  Findout the cost allocated to the storage area.andP;  Be sure to use the cost for theperiod indicated by cell D5, not for the entire year.andM;The cost of money (cell D10) is the interest rate at which the companytypically borrows money if it is a net borrower or invests money if it is anet investor.andP;  Purchasing more of an item per period than will be used inthat period typically means borrowing money at interest or forgoing interestthat would be earned on investments.andM;The last two inputs pertain to discounts offered on specific items.andP;  Thediscount rate (cell D12) is the percentage off the regular price that thevendor offers in exchange for a larger order.andP;  The discount order size (cellD13) is the smallest order you must place to get the discount.andM;THE ANALYSIS SECTIONandM;The worksheet uses several values from the Inputs section to find thepurchase-cost and order-cost savings.andP;  The purchase-cost saving is the amountthe company saves on the price of the order by taking the volume discount.andO;To find this amount, the formula in cell I6 multiplies the demand per period(cell D6) by the price per unit (cell D7), then multiplies that product bythe discount rate (cell D12).andP;  In the example, the company uses 1,000 unitsof the item per period at a cost of $2,500 (1,000 X $2.50), but by purchasing1,500 units at a time, the company saves 5% of that cost, or $125 per period.andM;The order-cost saving is the amount the company saves by placing larger andthus less-frequent orders.andP;  The formula in cell I7 divides the demand perperiod (cell D6) by the discount order size (cell D13), subtracts the resultfrom 1, and multiplies the difference by the order cost (cell D8).andP;  In theexample, ordering 1,500 units at a time, instead of the 1,000 units demandedduring a period, means that reordering is 33.33% less frequent, so the ordercost ($20) is multiplied by 0.3333, yielding $6.67.andM;The formula in cell I8 computes total savings by adding the purchase-costsaving and the order-cost saving.andM;The formulas in range I11..I13 show the downside of taking a volume discount.andO;Cell I11 computes the financing cost of purchasing excess units: that is, theinterest paid on the money borrowed for the purchase or the interest lost onmoney drawn from investments.andP;  The formula in cell I11 reads:andM;(D13-D6)*(D7*(1-D12))*(D10/(360/((D13-D6)/D6*D5)))andM;The first part of this formula calculates the total cost of the excess units.andO;It first subtracts the demand per period (cell D6) from the discount ordersize (cell D13) to find the excess number of units: In the example, 1,500 -1,000 = 500.andP;  It then subtracts the discount rate (cell D12) from 1 andmultiplies this difference by the prediscount price per unit (cell D7) tofind the discounted price per unit: (1 - 0.05) X $2.50 = $2.375.andP;  The formulathen multiplies these two values together to find the total cost of theexcess units: 500 X $2.375 = $1,187.50.andM;The second part of the formula calculates the interest rate applied to thetotal cost of the excess units.andP;  It is derived by adjusting the cost of moneyfor the number of days the excess units will last.andP;  The formula divides thenumber of excess units by the demand per period (cell D6) and multiplies thisquotient by the number of days in the demand period (cell D5): In theexample, (500 / 1,000) X 30 = 15.andP;  It then divides this product into thenumber of days in the financial calendar: 360 / 15 = 24.andP;  The formula dividesthis quotient into the cost of money (cell D10): 0.12 / 24 = 0.005.andP;  Finally,it multiplies this last quotient by the total value of the excess units(obtained in the first part of the formula) to determine the financing cost:$1,187.50 X 0.005 = $5.94.andM;The formula in cell I12 calculates the cost of storing the excess units.andP;  Theformula divides the demand per period (cell D6) by the discount order size(cell D13), subtracts this quotient from 1, and multiplies this difference bythe storage cost per period (cell D9): (1 - 1,000 / 1,500) X $225 = $75.00andM;The formula in cell I13 adds cells I11 and I12 to find the total cost ofacquiring and holding excess inventory: $5.94 + $75.00 = $80.94.andP;  The formulain cell I15 subtracts total costs (cell I13) from total savings (cell I8) tofind the net saving (or loss) realized by ordering more units and taking thevolume discount: $131.67 - $80.94 = $50.73.andM;To determine whether opting for the volume discount is really cost-effective,however, compare the discount order size with the EOQ.andP;  The formula in cellI17 calculates the EOQ.andP;  It divides the number of days in the financialcalendar by the number of days in a period (cell D5) and multiplies thisquotient by the demand per period (cell D6) to find the number of units usedper year: 360 / 30 X 1,000 = 12,000.andP;  It then multiplies the number of unitsused per year by 2 and multiplies this product by the order cost (cell D8):12,000 X 2 X 20 = 480,000.andP;  The formula divides this amount by the storagecost per unit: 480,000 / ($225 / 1,000) = 2,133,333.3.andP;  Finally, it takes thesquare root of this quotient to obtain the EOQ:andM;[square root of 2,133,333.3] = 1,461.andM;The EOQ does not depend on the price per unit.andP;  If the discount rate and thediscount order size lead to a net saving in cell I15 and if the discountorder size is within 10% of the EOQ, taking the volume discount is a goodidea.andP;  Cell I19 computes the variance between the discount order size and theEOQ.andP;  Compare this result with 10%.andP;  In the example, the variance is only2.63%, so ordering 1,500 units at a time is cost-effective.andM;Build the worksheet from the instructions on the next page.andP;  Then we'll seehow changing some values in the Inputs section can affect the results in theAnalysis section.andM;USING THE MODELandM;Change the value in cell D13 to 1,700 to see what happens when the buyer mustpurchase 1,700 units to get the volume discount.andP;  According to cell I15,doing so results in a net per-period saving of $28.95.andP;  But 1,700 units ismore than 16% higher than the EOQ.andP;  Buying the item in lots of 1,700 units isnot cost-effective, despite the volume discount.andM;Here's another scenario.andP;  Change the value in cell D13 to 1,600.andP;  The buyermust purchase 1,600 units to get the 5% discount, which yields a net savingof $39.58 per period.andP;  Because 1,600 units is only 9.5% greater than the EOQ,purchasing that many at a time is cost-effective.andP;  Now change the value incell D12 to 3%.andP;  At a 3% discount for buying at least 1,600 units, thesavings do not outweigh the costs.andP;  In this case, it's not worth ordering thelarger volume.andP;  The buyer does better to continue ordering an amount close tothe EOQ.andM;Once you know what it saves and what it costs to buy in bulk, you are in abetter position to negotiate price with your vendors.andP;  If a vendor won't dropthe price enough to make buying in bulk sensible, then look for alternatives.andM;One alternative is to have bulk orders shipped in smaller lots.andP;  Suchstaggered-shipment orders often merit the full discount but avoid thefinancing and storage costs.andP;  You receive and pay for the goods at a ratecloser to your actual usage rate.andP;  Don't forget that when you buy more, thevendor makes more money.andP;  The vendor isn't giving up anything by offering adiscount.andP;  The vendor is making less per unit but more money overall becauseof volume.andP;  Never shy away from asking for a bigger discount.andM;Ken Landis is a business consultant with The Mac Group of Cambridge, Mass.andO;He wrote about using float in the November 1989 issue of LOTUS.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
