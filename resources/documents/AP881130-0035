(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A racist murder that led to a $7 millioncivil verdict against the nation's oldest Ku Klux Klan group ismoving to the U.S. Supreme Court for a decision on whether defenselawyers can bar blacks from juries.   Defense lawyers say they doubt the high court will review whetherthey can challenge every prospective black juror in order to puttogether an all-white panel for Klan defendants.   But prosecutors in Alabama, joined by other states, contend theissue needs to be reviewed to prevent racial discrimination and giveprosecutors equal standing with defense lawyers when picking a juryin a racially oriented case.   ``The argument is not whether you have an all-white jury. Theargument is whether you can strike anybody because of race,'' saidUniversity of Virginia law associate professor Pamela Karlan.   A recent Supreme Court ruling barred prosecutors from suchracially tainted jury selection tactics. The question the courtmight face if it decides to hear the case is whether the ruling canbe extended to apply to the defense. A deadline for briefs was setfor today.   Defense attorneys are allowed to use any means within the law toget their clients off and this has included striking potentialjurors whom they believe would be prejudiced against their clients.   The case in question began March 21, 1981, when Michael Donald, a19-year-old black Mobile man, was abducted at random from a citystreet, beaten to death and his body hanged in a tree. KKK membersHenry Francis Hays and James ``Tiger'' Knowles were arrested inconnection with the slaying.   Hays was convicted of capital murder and received the deathpenalty. Knowles pleaded guilty to a federal charge of violatingDonald's civil rights and received a life prison sentence.   Last year, Donald's mother, Beulah Mae Donald, won a $7 millionlawsuit against the United Klans of America, resulting in heracquisition of the KKK headquarters building in Tuscaloosa. She soldthe building to a stockbroker. Mrs. Donald, 67, died earlier thisyear.   Mobile County prosecutors also filed murder charges against Hays'father, Bennie Jack Hays, and the younger Hays' brother-in-law,Frank Cox. During trial last February, the elder Hays collapsed incourt, prompting a mistrial.   But before the two can be retried, attorneys want the high courtto answer the question about jury composition: Can defense attorneysuse peremptory challenges to strike all blacks from a jury simplybecause of their race?   The court has not yet decided whether to hear the question, whichhas roused the interest of at least 40 prosecutors nationwide,Mobile County District Attorney Chris N. Galanos said in aninterview Wednesday.   In New York, a spokeswoman for Brooklyn District AttorneyElizabeth Holtzman said she filed a friend-of-the-court brief in thecase Monday night. Holtzman argues that prosecutors and defenseattorneys should be on equal footing in eliminating jurors, said thespokeswoman, Nancy Young.   Galanos said he attempted in pretrial proceedings, withoutsuccess, to block defense attorneys from using peremptory challengesto exclude blacks from the jury solely because of their race.   In the end, the jury in the Cox-Hays trial had only one black,who became an alternate juror before the mistrial.   Galanos said the chance for a Supreme Court review could havebeen enhanced if Alabama appeals courts had issued opinions in thecase instead of no-comment denials.   Cox's attorney, Neil Hanley, said Tuesday he had filed a one-pagebrief in the case, standing firm on legal precedent. He cited thecase two years ago, known as Batson vs. Kentucky, in which theSupreme Court ruled 7-2 that the prosecution in a criminal trial ofa black defendant could not use peremptory challenges to strike allblacks in the jury pool.   ``The Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment applies tostates and prohibits governmental discrimination. That's it,''Hanley said.   Hanley doesn't expect the high court to hear oral arguments onthe jury composition question ``but you never know.''   Karlan, who has followed the Batson case, said the high courtprobably would let the argument ``percolate'' in the lower courtsawhile longer. She said the high court specifically left thequestion open in Batson.   The state of Alabama has asked the high court to extend theBatson decision to defense counsel because racial discrimination injury selection _ whatever its source _ ``violates the constitutionalrights of the excluded jurors, harms every member of their race,prejudices the administration of justice and damages society as awhole,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
