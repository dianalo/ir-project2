The Southern California heat wave, with temperatures reachingthree digits, was expected to continue today, combined with thicksmog.   A severe storm that blew across northern Georgia on Tuesday wasblamed for two deaths, doubling the death toll from bad weatherthis week.   In the Northern Plains, water from the Red River filled thestreets of Wahpeton, N.D., and neighboring Breckenridge, Minn.,seriously damaging 40 homes and causing minor damage to hundreds ofothers, authorities said.   North Dakota Gov. George Sinner, who declared a state ofemergency for the valley on Monday, intended to tour floodedregions of Wahpeton and Fargo today.   ``Based on information I've received from the National WeatherService and state and local emergency management officials, seriousflooding is expected to threaten life and property along the RedRiver and its tributaries for the next several weeks,'' Sinner said.   A surge of severe thunderstorms and several tornadoes causeddamage but no injuries in South Carolina. In Georgia and Alabama,storms left at least 150,000 homes without electricity.   Storms caused flight delays of more than 1{ hours at HartsfieldAtlanta International Airport, said Roger Myers, a Federal AviationAdministration spokesman.   The worst of the Georgia storms struck along a line just southof the Blue Ridge Mountains and ripped off part of the roof of thehouse where Donna Weems and her 2-year-old son had taken shelter.``It sounded like everything in God's creation had hit thathouse,'' the Lindale woman said.   Trees blown down by the storms killed a 27-year-old Cleveland,Ga., woman and a 25-year-old Cumming man.   In Alabama, tornadoes and thunderstorms damaged dozens of homesand businesses and knocked out electricity to more than 100,000customers.   The Legislature recessed shortly after 3:30 p.m. Tuesday when afunnel-shaped cloud was spotted. Legislators and others evacuatedthe top floors of the Montgomery building for shelter in the twobottom floors until the weather cleared.   South Carolina authorities reported damage to houses and mobilehomes and said some power lines had been downed.   But Spartanburg County Sheriff's Department spokesman Mark Krueasaid: ``We were very lucky. It was not nearly as bad as it couldhave been. Since there were no injuries, we all feel better.''   In Indiana, the parents of a 16-month-old toddler swept out ofhis mother's arms after the family car stalled on a flooded gravelroad kept a silent vigil Tuesday as divers searched two swollencreeks for the body.   The search followed a night of torrential rain and wascomplicated by rising backwaters.   ``We hope we find him but we just don't know,'' said IndianaConservation Officer Duane Englert, who supervised the search.   Monday night's storm also led to the apparent electrocution ofan Indiana woman.   In California, the temperature at the downtown Los Angeles CivicCenter soared to 100 degrees Tuesday, breaking the 18-year-old markby seven degrees, according to the weather service. It also tiedthe all-time high for April, set on April 23, 1910. Los AngelesInternational Airport's 99 degrees also hit an all-time high forthe month.   Culver City, Montebello and Ontario also reached 100 degrees;Long Beach, San Gabriel and Monrovia recorded temperatures of 101and the desert community of Thermal peaked at 102.   Los Angeles County lifeguards from Zuma Beach to the South Baytelephoned reserves for extra help, adding dozens of lifeguards tomonitor the 100,000 beachgoers.   At Hermosa Beach, lifeguard Ted Clair saw crowds swell to 50,000.   ``The crowd is continuing to build,'' he said. ``It'sspringtime. People are tired of skiing and want to get into theirbeach mode.''   More record-breaking heat was expected today, along withfirst-stage smog alerts in the San Gabriel-Pomona area andmetropolitan Los Angeles. Hot, dry Santa Ana winds will cookSouthern California at least until the weekend, and the only reliefwill be felt Thursday along the coast when the sea breeze picks up,forecasters said.</TEXT></DOC>
