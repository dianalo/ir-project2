Freepublicity is even better. Or is it?   Coca-Cola Co. got more than its share of free publicitythis week -- but not the kind it might have been looking for.The sexual-harassment hearings for Supreme Court nomineeClarence Thomas included an allegation that he asked AnitaHill, when she was an employee of his, &quot;Who has put pubichair on my Coke?&quot; Then yesterday, New York newspapers werefilled with reports about a mass murderer who broke into anelderly couple's home, took them hostage and finally killedhimself -- but not before demanding that the police providehim with a six-pack of Coke.</LP><TEXT>   Coke is attempting to steer clear of both incidents. Aspokesman declines to comment other than to say that &quot;Cokeisn't affected one way or the other.&quot; But marketing expertssay such unwanted product publicity raises tough issues forimage-conscious advertisers such as Coke. Kraft GeneralFoods' Kool-Aid endured a public-relations nightmare in 1978after hundreds of followers of cult leader Jim Jones died bydrinking poisoned fruit drink -- even though the drink wasn'teven Kool-Aid itself, as widely reported, but a cheapercompetitor. McDonald's in 1984 razed its San Ysidro, Calif.,restaurant -- and briefly pulled its national advertising --after a gunman killed 21 people there.   Those incidents &quot;are one of the prices you pay for being ahousehold name,&quot; a McDonald's spokesman says. &quot;Just abouteverything that can happen in the course of life is going tohappen at a McDonald's, or with a Coke sitting on the table.&quot;   Some marketing executives say Coke's unexpected&quot;endorsement&quot; in current news events may actually give thebrand name a boost, particularly as the product itself wasn'tcontaminated or at fault. &quot;It will help public perception.It's the soft drink of preference,&quot; says Richard Winger, aconsultant with Boston Consulting Group's New York office.   Steven E. Permut, president of Marketing Sciences Inc.,based in New Haven, Conn., goes so far as to predict anuptick in Coke sales on the heels of the Thomas hearings.Coke &quot;benefited immensely,&quot; he said. &quot;In this case Pepsiloses and Coke wins.&quot; The effect, he says, is similar to aproduct placement in a movie: The product isn't the star, butit makes an impression. In this case, the product placementis free.   Some industry executives say marketers shouldn't react atall when their product gets dragged into the news unless theproduct itself is under attack. In one of the best-known suchcases, Johnson andamp; Johnson had to step in to reassure consumerswhen some Tylenol capsules were poisoned, because the productitself had been compromised. Airlines nearly always pulltheir advertising temporarily after a plane crash. In adesperate attempt to keep an air carrier's name out of thenews, most airlines promptly dispatch an employee to a crashsite to try to cover up the company name on the plane so thatit doesn't appear in news reports.   But in Coke's case, &quot;no one is finding fault,&quot; says JoelPortugal, a principal with identity consultants AnspachGrossman Portugal. The crude remark allegedly made by JudgeThomas &quot;isn't dragging Coke's name through the mud,&quot; he says.&quot;It's probably pretty good free advertising.&quot;   But although marketing experts agree that the Judge Thomasflap isn't bad for Coke, don't look for Coke executives totry to capitalize on the situation. As Jack Trout of theconsulting firm Trout andamp; Ries puts it, &quot;Judge Thomas willnever get picked up as a celebrity spokesperson.&quot;   ---   Qantas's New Commercials                                                                                                          Someone is missing from D'Arcy Masius Benton andamp; Bowles'snew commercials for Qantas Airways Ltd. It's the dour littlekoala bear, the one who hates Qantas.
