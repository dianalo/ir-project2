A number of programs have tested and proven themanufacture, handling, transportation, and utilization of CWF in a varietyof applications in utilities and industry. These programs have answeredmany of the basic questions regarding CWF, although acceptance by usershas not been achieved. What remains is a viable conversion to break thebarrier leading to commercialization. Eastern Canada, because of itsdependence on imported oil, was considered a good location for largescale testing of CWF by the Canadian government. It has proven coal reserves,although they are considered high in sulfur content. The fine grindingnecessary for CWF production enables deep cleaning to reduce ash andsulfur. Funding under the National Energy Program provided the impetusfor a program aimed at testing the manufacture and utilization of CWFin a utility boiler. The Cape Breton Development Corporation (CBDC),as the major eastern Canadian coal producer, saw the CWF technology asa means to increase the marketability of its product. It acquired themanufacturing rights to the Swedish Carbogel CWF process and under anagreement with the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources (EMR) andthe New Brunswick Electric Power Commission (NBEPC), constructed a 4tph continuous production CWF pilot plant. Over the past two years thisplant has made some 7500 tonnes of CWF, with 5000 tonnes being producedfor testing at the Chatham Generating Station of NBEPC.</TEXT></DOC>
