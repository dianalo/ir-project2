Police said six people werewounded.   A police spokesman said a white Volvo blew up at around 1 p.m.near a bank on the main street of the town in eastern Lebanon. Theblast damaged parked cars, setting several on fire, and shatteredwindows in nearby buildings.   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under standingregulations, said ambulances and fire engines went to the scene.Syrian troops sealed off the blast area.   The car bomb was the 12th in Lebanon this year. By police count,103 people have been killed and 371 wounded in the bombings.   As with the earlier bombings this year, there was no claim ofresponsibility for today's explosion.   The highway where the bomb exploded links the Bekaa Valley withBeirut and is the main route used by the Syrian army to supply itsforces in Moslem west Beirut.   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains about 40,000troops in the Bekaa Valley, north Lebanon as well as west and southBeirut.   The Syrians have been at odds with Lebanon's Christians sincePresident Amin Gemayel, a Maronite Catholic, scuttled aSyrian-brokered December 1985 treaty between Christians and Moslemsto end Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war.   Christian anger has mounted following Syria's support for one ofits Christian allies, former President Suleiman Franjieh, inLebanon's presidential contest.   Right-wing militants of the Lebanese Forces, the Christians'main militia, oppose Franjieh. Syrian-backed Moslem factions haveaccused the militia of forcibly preventing Christian legislatorsfrom attending an Aug. 18 parliamentary session where a presidentwas to have been elected.   Only 38 of the 76 deputies turned up. Because that was notenough for a quorum, the election was postponed. No new date hasbeen set.   Gemayel's six-year term expires Sept. 23. He cannot run for asecond term.</TEXT></DOC>
