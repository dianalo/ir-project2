Freedman and Richard Gibson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> KRA MO WNEWS </CO><IN> FOD TNM TOB </IN><TEXT>   Kraft Inc. accepted a sweetened $13.1 billion takeover bid from Philip Morris Cos. that would create the world's largest consumer products company.    Under the agreement, reached after a weekend of intense negotiations in Chicago and New York, Philip Morris is raising its cash bid for Kraft to $106 a share from its initial offer of $90 a share two weeks ago. The acquisition would be the second largest in history, exceeded only by Chevron Corp.'s 1984 takeover of Gulf Oil for $13.3 billion.    Kraft, based in Glenview, Ill., had strenuously resisted Philip Morris's initial bid, proposing instead a recapitalization it valued at $110 a share in an effort to remain independent. But the package included junk-bond securities as well as cash and wasn't greeted warmly by Kraft shareholders or Wall Street arbitragers. No other bidder materialized, leaving Kraft little choice but to accept a sweetened offer from Philip Morris.    Both sides claimed victory yesterday: Philip Morris because it snagged its quarry, Kraft because it extracted a much higher price. In a statement, John Richman, chairman and chief executive officer of Kraft, called the merger &quot;the best possible outcome for our employees, customers and communities in which we operate.&quot;    The merger would make Philip Morris pre-eminent on many fronts: the world's biggest consumer products company, ahead of Unilever N.V., a British-Dutch concern; the world's biggest food company, and by far the world's biggest advertiser. Philip Morris, already the owner of well-known trademarks such as Maxwell House, Jell-O and Oscar Mayer, is buying another trove of powerhouse brands including Velveeta cheese, Miracle Whip toppings and Parkay margarine.    But Philip Morris is paying dearly for Kraft, some analysts said. Before the company made its initial bid, Kraft stock was only trading at $60 a share.    &quot;It's simply far too much money,&quot; said David Goldman, an analyst at Fahnestock andamp; Co. &quot;Even under the so-called recapitalization plan, it was difficult to arrive at anything over $100 a share in true value.&quot; Mr. Goldman said the diversification move should help improve the performance of Philip Morris's General Foods unit, acquired in 1985, but he maintained there were better companies to be had at lower prices, including Sara Lee Corp., Gerber Products Co. and Quaker Oats Co.    &quot;I thought $90 a share was rich,&quot; added L. Craig Carver of Dain, Bosworth andamp; Co. in Minneapolis. The sweetened bid works out to about 21 times Kraft's cash flow, he calculated. That's far more than Grand Metropolitan PLC of Britain's bid for Pillsbury Co., the analyst added.    A Philip Morris spokesman termed the price &quot;full and generous . . . but well worth it.&quot; One Philip Morris adviser said the final price was what the company originally thought Kraft was worth, &quot;give or take a dollar.&quot;    Despite the debt that will be incurred for the merger, the company expects earnings to grow 15% next year, the spokesman said. Philip Morris plans to use $12 billion in bank loans and $1.1 billion of its cash.    Philip Morris said it has no plans to sell any part of Kraft to finance the merger and that Kraft will retain its headquarters in Glenview.    The spokesman acknowledged the cost of the acquisition will slow Philip Morris's growth &quot;somewhat&quot; from what it would have been but predicted Kraft would &quot;really energize&quot; Philip Morris starting in 1990. This year, the company is expecting 30% earnings growth, partly because of one-time tax considerations and unusually strong cigarette sales overseas, especially in Japan.    The Kraft acquisition is a major advance in Philip Morris's goal to diversify outside tobacco. While cigarette manufacturing is highly profitable, consumption is declining about 2% a year, and Philip Morris sees its long-term future in the food business. Philip Morris wanted Kraft in particular because its brands don't overlap with General Foods' and because the two companies share the same distribution networks for many products.    Kraft also has broad-based strength overseas, unlike General Foods. Philip Morris wants to strengthen its international business to compete more effectively against Unilever and Nestle S.A., particularly because competition is expected to increase when European trade barriers are lifted in 1992.    Moreover, Philip Morris Chairman Hamish Maxwell said he hopes the acquisition will improve the company's image with investors. Tobacco stocks have been depressed in recent years because of concerns about tobacco-liability lawsuits and the future of the business.    With the Kraft acquisition, more than half of Philip Morris's sales will come from food. In 1987, the company earned $1.8 billion, or $7.75 a share, on sales of $27.7 billion, including about $10 billion from General Foods. Philip Morris also owns Miller Brewing Co. Kraft earned $489 million, or $3.60 a share, on sales of $9.9 billion.    According to a Philip Morris spokesman, Kraft currently has 120 million shares outstanding and 3.8 million stock options.    Mr. Maxwell isn't the only tobacco executive concerned about share prices. The management of RJR Nabisco Inc. is trying to take that company private, partly out of frustration over its stock price. The buy-out would be even larger than the Philip Morris-Kraft deal.    With the Kraft acquisition, Philip Morris also is getting a widely respected management team, in particular Michael A. Miles, Kraft's president and chief operating officer. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Miles will become president and chief executive, reporting to Mr. Richman. The Kraft chairman will become a vice chairman of Philip Morris &quot;to get the benefits of this association working for us quickly,&quot; Mr. Maxwell said.    In addition, two other members of the Kraft board are expected to join Philip Morris's board.    The takeover saga began Oct. 17 when Mr. Maxwell made a telephone call to Mr. Richman telling him that Philip Morris was launching a tender offer the next day. According to a Kraft source, Mr. Richman was especially shocked by the news because the two men had sat together at a trade association meeting in Washington only a few days earlier and Mr. Maxwell hadn't given any hint of his plans.    As Philip Morris's siege began, Kraft strategists, including advisers at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Wachtell Lipton reviewed options ranging from a leveraged buy-out to searching for a friendly suitor. According to one adviser, they also considered publicly attacking Philip Morris as a &quot;merchant of death&quot; in an attempt to capitalize on anti-smoking sentiment.    A week later, Kraft proposed its recapitalization plan. Under the plan, shareholders were to receive a cash dividend of $84 a share and junk-bond securities Kraft valued at $14 a share. Shareholders would retain their Kraft stock, which the company valued at about $12 a share.    The recapitalization, with its huge debt, caused &quot;a lot of anxiety among directors and operations people,&quot; according to one source close to Kraft's board. The sale of substantial blocks of Kraft's business was likely, the board knew. But Mr. Richman pointed out that the company would have to undergo significant change if it were to remain independent.    When it announced its recapitalization plan, Kraft left the door open for further negotiations by indicating it would talk with anyone willing to put $110 a share on the table. But what followed for the next few days was a high-stakes poker game. Although Philip Morris had indicated from the start that it was willing to discuss terms, it didn't move to make a higher bid. Philip Morris advisers felt no move was necessary because no other suitor was emerging and because the recapitalization wasn't going over well with investors.    Philip Morris's hand also was strengthened late last week by a general plunge in takeover stocks fueled by concerns on Wall Street about financing for takeovers. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, warned bankers about lending too much for leveraged buy-outs and other takeovers.    Another shock was the delay of a $1.15 billion junk-bond issue of Federated Department Stores Inc., which was acquired earlier this year by Campeau Corp. in a highly leveraged transaction.    By late last week, Kraft shares were trading in the low $90s. They closed Friday at $96.50, up $2, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on volume of 2.4 million shares. Philip Morris shares closed at $94.75, down 25 cents.    Although Philip Morris thought it was in the driver's seat, it was considering other options in case the deal collapsed. It even toyed with making a bid for RJR Nabisco's food operations. Philip Morris is flush with cash, thanks largely to its tobacco business, and it was determined to make an acquisition. Some insiders even feared the company's enormous cash flow -- an estimated $11 billion over the next five years --- might even make it a takeover target itself despite its size.    The impasse began to break Friday when Bruce Wasserstein, Philip Morris's main financial adviser, placed a call to Willard J. Overlock Jr., his Kraft counterpart. At about the same time, Arthur Fleischer Jr., a Philip Morris lawyer, was negotiating with Martin Lipton of Wachtell Lipton.    &quot;It appeared we were in pretty close talking range, and we decided it made sense for the two chief executives to meet,&quot; said one source close to the negotiations.    Mr. Maxwell and his advisers flew to Chicago Friday evening and met with Mr. Richman and his aides at an airport hotel. After a private hourlong meeting, the two men agreed on the $106-a-share price at 1 a.m. Later Saturday morning, the two companies began to thrash out the details of the agreement. Although the companies have been publicly trading barbs in the last two weeks, Mr. Maxwell characterized the weekend discussions as cordial.    Kraft directors met yesterday afternoon in New York at Wachtell Lipton's offices and approved the proposed merger. As Mr. Maxwell left Philip Morris headquarters on Park Avenue around 4 o'clock to sign the agreement, company advisers and executives gathered around and gave him a round of applause.    The deal is also a coup for Philip Morris's merger advisers, Wasserstein, Perella andamp; Co., although the firm's estimated $12 million fee is relatively small given the merger's size. A Wasserstein executive said the fee for the Kraft deal is only part of a broader agreement the firm has to do merger work for Philip Morris. Wasserstein Perella was started earlier this year by Mr. Wasserstein and Joseph Perella, two top merger advisers who left First Boston Corp.    In addition to working with Goldman Sachs, Kraft directors also retained Lazard Freres andamp; Co. as special advisers to the board.    Despite the merger's size, Philip Morris has maintained that it doesn't pose an antitrust problem because General Foods and Kraft make very few of the same products. Nevertheless, Philip Morris began a vigorous lobbying effort among senators and congressmen in Washington immediately after making its offer two weeks ago.    &quot;We simply informed some members on both sides of the aisles, whose constituencies might be affected, about what we were doing,&quot; a Philip Morris spokesman said.    The company also made a pre-merger filing under the Hart Scott Rodino Act with the Federal Trade Commission two weeks ago. The FTC, which has several weeks to respond, hasn't requested any more information from Philip Morris.    Under the terms of the merger agreement, Kraft's common stock purchase rights -- its so-called poison pill -- will be redeemed at 0.01 cents per right immediately prior to completion of the offer, and no further dividends will be paid by Kraft. The tender offer, which is subject to certain conditions, expires at midnight EST Nov. 15, unless extended. The merger is expected to close shortly after the tender offer is completed, Philip Morris said.    ---            How the Latest Combination Would Look              1987 sales in billions of dollars  Philip Morris  $27.7 billion    $14.6  Cigarettes -- Marlboro, Benson andamp; Hedges, Virginia              Slims    $10.0  General Foods -- Maxwell House coffee, Bird Eye              frozen foods, Entenmann's, Jell-O, Oscar Mayer              meats, Post cereals, Ronzoni     $3.1  Brewing -- Miller, Lite, Matilda Bay wine coolers  Kraft  $9.9 billion     $4.5  Consumer foods -- Kraft, Breakstone dairy              products, Breyers, Frusen Gladje, Budget              Gourmet frozen dinners, Tombstone pizza     $3.0  Food service and ingredients     $2.3  International foods   ---                Ten Largest U.S. Acquisitions                                  Cost   Companies              (In billions)        Year   Chevron of Gulf Oil           $13.3         1984   Philip Morris of Kraft         13.1         1988   Texaco of Getty Oil            10.1         1984   Du Pont of Conoco               8.0         1981   British Petroleum of   remaining 45% interest in   Standard Oil of Ohio            7.8         1987   U.S. Steel of Marathon Oil      6.6         1981   General Electric of RCA         6.0         1985   Mobil of Superior Oil           5.7         1984   Philip Morris of   General Foods                   5.6         1985   Royal Dutch Shell of   remaining 30.5% in   Shell Oil                       5.5         1984    Source: W.T.
