An American Standard spokesman wouldn't elaborate on the company's statement, which was released yesterday evening. A Black andamp; Decker spokeswoman said the company had no immediate comment.    Wall Street traders said yesterday that they weren't aware of any other parties showing a strong interest in taking over American Standard.    The American Standard announcement &quot;suggests that we're near the end of the battle&quot; over the Black andamp; Decker bid for the company, one Wall Street arbitrager said last night.    Late last week, the company sweetened its recapitalization plan to offer holders of each common share $64 in cash, $5 in securities and one share in the recapitalized company. Some analysts have valued that package at $73 to $74 a share. Black andamp; Decker's offer now stands at $73 a share.    American Standard's common closed yesterday at $73 a share, down 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Black andamp; Decker closed at $17.75 a share, also down 25 cents.    Black andamp; Decker argued earlier in federal court in Wilmington, Del., that its bid hasn't been fairly considered by American Standard. During the proceeding, Judge Joseph Longobardi pressed American Standard to show that it had considered all options in addition to its recapitalization plan.    The Black andamp; Decker offer is scheduled to expire March 19. Some analysts said this week that they expect American Standard to come up with another sweetened proposal before that deadline. </TEXT></DOC>
