(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A mother has been ordered not to smokein front of her 5-year-old son by a judge hearing a child custodydispute.   Judge David Stirling issued the ruling Tuesday in Superior Courtwhen the boy's father, Manfred Kallweit, complained of health risksassociated with inhaling second-hand smoke.   The mother, Anna Maria De Beni Souza, called the order crazy.Terry Eagan, regional vice president for the Tobacco Institute andTobacco Action Network said he's ``never heard of anything likethis in any other part of the country.''   Eagan said he would have the industry's lawyers investigate thecase. ``The first thing that comes to my mind is the privacyissue,'' Eagan said.   Kallweit, who has joint custody of the boy, asked the judge toimpose the order after De Beni Souza petitioned the court for solecustody. The petition is pending.   The ruling, which bans smoking ``in direct presence of childwithin the home,'' will stay in effect until the boy turns 18 or ahigher judge overrules it.   ``If this is a new wave, so be it,'' said Kallweit's lawyer,Charles Asbury. ``I appreciate all the problems that cigarettespose in the world.   ``The courts have regularly forbidden people to drink alcoholand consume drugs in child custody cases, the reason being the riskof harm to the child. Smoking poses the same risk of harm.''   De Beni Souza said she's a light smoker who goes through a packof cigarettes in two or three days.   ``What right does the court have to dictate my behavior in theprivacy of my own home?'' she said. ``This is not Russia, right?''</TEXT></DOC>
