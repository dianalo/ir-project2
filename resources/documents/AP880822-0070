The size of Sunday's spontaneous protest, the biggest againstthe invasion since 1969, took foreigners and residents by surprise.Witnesses saw at least eight people detained around the city,including Jan Urban, spokesman for the human rights group Charter77.   Twenty-eight people were in custody today and authoritiesexpelled six of seven foreigners detained during the demonstration,the state news agency CTK said. It gave no other details on theforeigners.   The 28 protesters were held ``pending investigation forsuspected hooliganism,'' the agency said. It also reported that twopolice officers were slightly injured by bottles thrown from thecrowd Sunday.   The marchers chanted demands for freedom, the withdrawal ofSoviet troops and support for Alexander Dubcek, the ex-CommunistParty leader who pioneered the reforms of 1968.   In Moscow, troops charged hundreds of demonstrators and pushedthem out of a central park Sunday when the protesters beganchanting ``Prague, Prague, Prague!'' in memory of the invasion.   No injuries were reported among about 500 demonstrators andonlookers, or among the 500 national guard soldiers and police.   Several dozen people, some shouting ``Fascists!'' at police,were taken away. Two activists reported separately that 30 of theprotesters were punched and kicked at a nearby militia stationafter the demonstration.   More than 100 of the protesters were detained, said activistAlexander Podrabinek. Four people were sentenced to 15 days in jailand 40 others were fined, he said. Most of those detained werereleased after interrogation, the CTK agency said.   About 100 demonstrators held a second rally later Sunday alongMoscow's Arbat shopping mall, but police chased them away andarrested an unspecified number, said Alexander Chuyev, a member ofthe Democratic Union, an unofficial group that wants Soviet troopsout of Eastern Europe.   The protests marked Aug. 20-21, 1968, when Soviet-led troops ledan invasion of this nation of 15.5 million people.   In the spring of 1968, the Czech reformists under Dubcekdeclared their intent to create a democratic socialist system thatwould guarantee free speech and assembly, introduce secret ballotelections and economic reforms.   Sunday's police response suggested Czech authorities will nottolerate renewed protests against the invasion, which Sovietleaders continue to insist was ``justified.''   The anniversary march through Prague began after several hundredpeople milled around in Wenceslas Square, the site in 1968 and 1969of bloody protests against the invasion.   Peace activists collected hundreds of signatures Sunday on apetition demanding a Soviet troop withdrawal, free elections,abolition of censorship and the release of political prisoners.   Police kept careful watch on the crowd and, in the earlyevening, protesters began to chant ``Freedom, Freedom!'' and about10,000 marched toward the Old Town Square, a traditional rallyingpoint.   About 8,000 began heading toward the Vltava River, apparentlyhoping to cross to Hradcany Castle, the official residence ofPresident Gustav Husak, who became party leader in 1969 and washimself replaced in December by Milos Jakes.   Dubcek, 67, was expelled from the party in 1970 and given aminor forestry job in Bratislava. Now retired, he said last weekthat he planned to spend the invasion anniversary quietly at hiscountry cottage.   After police blocked three bridges across the river, the marchdwindled to about 1,000 people. When the smaller crowd tried tomarch back to the square, helmeted police moved in with batons,tear gas, and dogs. They beat at least two people and draggedothers away.   The state-run news agency CTK issued a brief report on theprotests, saying ``disturbing actions'' were mounted and that ``theconsiderate and decisive action of the police prevented riots.''   Earlier Sunday on Wenceslas Square, 200 people walked behind tworepresentatives of the Charter 77 movement, Eva Kanturkoa and TomasHradilek, who tried to lay flowers by the statue of King Wenceslas.   Uniformed police pushed back the two activists and others whotried to lay flowers in memory of countrymen killed in streetviolence after the invasion.   Three Charter 77 spokesmen were detained Saturday as they walkedto the Soviet embassy to deliver a statement appealing to theKremlin to tell the truth about the 1968 invasion. They were laterreported released, but were not seen at Sunday's demonstrations.   Witnesses also said one person was detained when eight peopletried to lay flowers at Czechoslovak state radio, also the scene offierce fighting in 1968.</TEXT></DOC>
