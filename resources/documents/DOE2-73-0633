The resolutionrequires, on one hand, the reduction of disturbances at origin and, onthe other, the increase of immunity levels of sensitive equipment. Presentknowledge allows the disturbances to be classified adequately by theidentification of the diverse sources; in addition, the principal drawbacksthat the disturbances could cause, are already known. The work requiredthen consists in the quantification of disturbance levels by means ofexperimental investigations conducted for the different environmentsof diverse types of industrial plants. The final aim would be the qualificationof electronic equipment for use in the industrial sector. This requiresthe creation of a precise and complete normative which would cover allaspects of compatibility. The paper illustrates the different sourcesof disturbances in industrial power distribution networks and describesthe effects of such disturbances of the equipment.</TEXT></DOC>
