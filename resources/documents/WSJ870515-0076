The company said the high-volume link in its network is the first of its kind in the world.    The new link can work at a speed about three times as fast as the first fiber-optic equipment MCI installed in its intercity network in 1983, illustrating the advances in fiber-optic technology, which uses light to carry large volumes of information on glass cables as thin as human hairs.    The nation's second-largest long-distance company said the 20-mile link, between New York and West Orange, N.J., is transmitting 1.13 gigabits of information per second using Rockwell International Corp. equipment. A gigabit equals one billion bits. In comparison, MCI's first fiber-optic link could move information at 405 megabits per second. A megabit equals one million bits. The company has a major switching facility in West Orange.    MCI said it plans to install more 1.13 gigabit fiber-optic technology in its network this year. </TEXT></DOC>
