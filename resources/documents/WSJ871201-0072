The change is expected to allow the utility to transfer as much as $48.5 million in accumulated deferred investment tax credits into non-operating profit over the next three years. Typically, the application of such credits to earnings is spread over a 30-year period.    Washington Water Power said the move is designed to improve the company's &quot;near-term financial situation.&quot; Under regulatory approval, however, the company won't be allowed to increase its $2.48 annual dividend on common stock during the accelerated three-year amortization of credits.    The utility said earnings for the first quarter will increase to $24.5 million, or 92 cents a share, from the $19.1 million, or 68 cents a share, previously reported. For the second quarter, restated earnings will increase to $11.5 million, or 33 cents a share, from $6.1 million, or nine cents a share. In the third quarter, earnings will be restated to $7.1 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.6 million. There were no per-share earnings in the third quarter prior to restatement because preferred dividend requirements exceeded net income.    In 1986, Washington Water Power had first-quarter earnings of $31.6 million, or $1.22 a share, second-quarter earnings of $12.5 million, or 39 cents a share, and third-quarter profit of $4.7 million, or two cents a share.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Washington Water Power closed at $23, unchanged, in a generally sharply lower stock market. </TEXT></DOC>
