But U.S. efforts to make sure Iraqi aircraft aren't usedto attack rebel positions may be more symbolic thanmilitarily significant. White House and Pentagon officials,while determined to keep up military pressure on SaddamHussein's embattled regime, at this point don't seem equallydetermined to use force to keep his fleet of attackhelicopters on the ground. And the White House reiterated theU.S isn't seeking to rekindle a shooting war to help topplethe Iraqi dictator.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, April Glaspie, the former U.S. ambassador toIraq, insisted that the administration had sent &quot;clear andrepeated&quot; warnings to Saddam Hussein before the invasion thatthe U.S. would forcefully defend its vital interests. Hertestimony raised questions about why she wasn't defended morevigorously by State Department officials, including Secretaryof State James Baker, against accusations that she signaledIraq that the U.S. wouldn't react strongly to his aggression.   After a pair of Air Force F-15 jets yesterday shot downone Iraqi Su-22 attack plane and forced another Su-22 toland, President Bush warned that U.S. pilots have standingorders to pursue any Iraqi aircraft that take off inviolation of the Gulf war's temporary cease-fire. &quot;If otherplanes violate the agreement, they will be shot down,&quot; Mr.Bush told reporters, adding, &quot;I don't think that's likely tohappen.&quot;   Administration officials said the dogfight, the firstair-to-air engagement since the early days of this winter'sU.S.-led war against Iraq, was intended largely to prodBaghdad to follow through quickly on its pledges ofconcessions before a formal cease-fire is signed.   But in the meantime, some administration officialssuggested that all-out military efforts to assistanti-Hussein forces may not serve long-term U.S. interests inthe region. If fighting inside Iraq makes it impossible forany government to establish control over the entire country,they said, Iran could gain great influence in the MiddleEast.   Former Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger, for one,worries that that already may have happened. &quot;After all theseyears . . . we have made Iran the dominant power in theGulf,&quot; he said.   The separate Kurdish and Shiite-led rebellions in Iraq --which already have prompted widespread street fighting innorthern and southern regions of the country -- have movedmore quickly than many administration officials expected. TopU.S. Middle East analysts are far less certain that SaddamHussein can contain the revolts now than they were a fewweeks ago.   &quot;If his chances of winning were 40% to 60% before,&quot; onegovernment expert on Iraq said, &quot;they have clearly slippedcloser to the 40% end of the range.&quot;   The dogfight over northern Iraq would seem to have broadsupport among the U.S. public, according to a Wall StreetJournal/NBC News poll. In a survey of 1,505 voters conductedFriday through Tuesday, 69% favored restarting militaryaction if, for instance, Iraq uses chemical weapons againstits own people.   The poll found no softening in attitudes toward Iraq orSaddam Hussein now that the war is over. Eighty-five percentof those polled still want to see the Iraqi leader tried forwar crimes. By 55% to 41%, they oppose allowing him to gointo exile if he steps down; in a poll a month ago, voterswere split at 46% on the question. By 78% to 18%, they opposecontributing money to help rebuild Iraq.   Ms. Glaspie's appearance yesterday before the SenateForeign Relations Committee was her first chance to answerwidespread criticism of her actions in the final days beforethe Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Most of the criticism followedthe release last fall of an Iraqi transcript of a privatemeeting she had with Saddam Hussein days before the invasion.   In remarks attributed to Ms. Glaspie in the transcript,she told Saddam Hussein that the U.S. had no opinion on &quot;yourborder disagreement with Kuwait.&quot; However, the formerambassador told the committee yesterday that the transcriptomitted the part of the sentence in which she said the U.S.would &quot;insist on {border} settlements being made in anonviolent manner.&quot; She said the transcript contained &quot;manyinaccuracies&quot; and had been &quot;edited maliciously&quot; by theIraqis.   But when discussing the transcript in a televisioninterview in September, Mr. Baker never characterized it asgrossly inaccurate. And State Department spokesmen routinelynoted only that the transcript had been produced by Iraq.Yesterday, the State Department said that its policy barspublicly discussing the details of diplomatic meetings.   Ms. Glaspie insisted yesterday that the administration'spolicy toward Iraq hadn't been faulty. Rather, she recalledtelling Saddam Hussein that &quot;we were a superpower andintended to act like one.&quot; The U.S. mistake, she toldlawmakers, &quot;was that, like every government in the world, wefoolishly didn't realize he was stupid.&quot;   When asked why the department hadn't permitted her totestify earlier to end criticism of her performance, she saidthat the administration had been busy building a coalitionand fighting the war and that &quot;now is the time forretrospectives.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
