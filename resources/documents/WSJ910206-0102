An initial reluctanceto give anything at all, followed by a level of support thatis grossly disproportionate to the resources of the world'ssecond-richest nation and to Japan's substantial interests inthe region, have done little to dim the country's image asthe world's biggest free rider.   Japan has refused to provide even symbolic militaryparticipation in an operation that President Bush hasdescribed as a prototype for &quot;the new world order.&quot; Theleading explanation offered by the Japanese -- and acceptedby the U.S. government -- is that such participation isforbidden by their U.S.-written constitution. Article 9 ofthat constitution, the famous peace clause, seems at firstglance to explicitly support this claim:</LP><TEXT>   Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based onjustice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce waras the sovereign right of the nation and the threat or theuse of force as means of settling international disputes.   In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph,land, sea and air forces, as well as other war potential,will never be maintained.   But in fact, an inspection of the origins and real meaningof Article 9 shows there is no constitutional barrier toJapan dispatching forces to the Persian Gulf.   Many constitutional issues ultimately depend on anassessment of the &quot;original intent&quot; of the drafters. In thiscase, some of those present at the creation of Japan'sconstitution are still alive, making it possible to establishconclusively what that intent was.   Col. Charles Kades, chairman of the Occupation SteeringCommittee on revising the Japanese constitution, recentlyaddressed the issue of collective security in the Summer 1989Political Science Quarterly. In 1947, as Col. Kades's groupprogressed toward a final draft, several Japanese cabinetmembers expressed to him their concern that Article 9 mightprevent Japan from joining the United Nations, becauseArticle 43 of the U.N. Charter requires all U.N. members tomake available to the Security Council, &quot;on its call . . .armed forces . . . for the purpose of maintaininginternational peace and security.&quot;   To alleviate these concerns, the Steering Committeealtered the wording of the peace clause. Instead of theblanket ban on war originally proposed by Gen. DouglasMacArthur, the Steering Committee followed the suggestion ofHitoshi Ashida, chairman of the constitutional committee ofthe Japanese Diet, and adopted the phrases that now form thebeginning of each of the sentences of Article 9: &quot;Aspiringsincerely to an international peace based on justice andorder . . .&quot;; and &quot;In order to accomplish the aim of thepreceding paragraph . . .&quot; The intention of the drafters ofthis revision was, according to Col. Kades, &quot;to permit Japanto have forces . . . to contribute an armed contingent to aUnited Nations international force.&quot;   Seven years later, the Japanese government once againstated in the firmest possible way that Article 9 was noobstacle to participating in collective security militaryactions. When the postwar Japanese military was created in1954, members of the Diet who opposed the Self-Defense ForcesAct contended that it violated Article 9. The government ofthe day argued that the U.N. Charter took precedence over theJapanese constitution -- and that Article 51 of the charterexpressly grants to all sovereign nations &quot;the right toindividual and collective self-defense.&quot; It is Article 51, bythe way, that is cited in every NATO handbook as the legalbasis for the organization's existence.   In other words, when Japan wants to maintain militaryforces, it argues that the U.N. Charter trumps its nationalconstitution. But when Japan is asked to lend these forces toan act of collective security, it argues, on the other hand,that the constitution trumps the U.N. Charter.   More recently, the Japanese government has itselfacknowledged that the question of deploying troops abroad isnot a constitutional one. In June 1987, Tokyo flatlyrejected, on constitutional grounds, a request from the U.S.to participate in a multilateral naval force sent to thePersian Gulf after an attack on an American ship. However,two months later in response to questioning in the Diet,Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone acknowledged that there wasno constitutional basis for his decision. His decision not tosend minesweepers to the Gulf, he said, was a political one,made because &quot;. . . there is a possibility that they will beembroiled in combat.&quot; Similarly, by putting before the Diet aproposal to send Japanese forces to join the coalition in theGulf, Prime Minister Kaifu implicitly expressed hisgovernment's conviction that committing forces abroad was notunconstitutional.   Both Secretary of State James Baker (in October testimonybefore the Senate Foreign Relations Committee) and PresidentBush (in a October press conference) have accepted Japan'sclaim that its constitution prevents it from providingmilitary assistance to the coalition. Both men surely knowbetter, or have aides who do. But both were apparentlyreflecting the consensus among U.S. policymakers that Japandoesn't seem fully remorseful for its World War II excessesand has given no indication of what it imagines its futurerole in the world to be.   There are indeed serious political objections in Japan tomilitary action. There are problems too for Japan's neighborsin a Japanese military role. But these issues must beaddressed frontally. They ought not to be obscured by a smokescreen of bogus constitutional legalisms.   ---   Mr. Hellmann is a professor of international studies atthe University of Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
