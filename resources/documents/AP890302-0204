STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Investigators have cracked a major spyring in which West German ``hackers'' allegedly acquired sensitivemilitary computer passwords and codes and sold them to the Soviets,an official said Thursday.   A West German television network said the passwords and otherinformation came from key military and research computers in theUnited States, Western Europe and Japan.   Three West Germans have been detained on suspicion of ``obtaininginformation about access to databanks, and to have passed that on toSoviet intelligence agents,'' said Roland Bachmeier, spokesman forthe federal Interior Ministry.   He refused to confirm other details of a report by theNorddeutsche Rundfunk broadcasting network.   The Pentagon issued a one-sentence statement Thursday saying:``Until possibly affected components of the Department of Defensehave had a chance to analyze the report, we have no reaction.''   William Caldwell, a Pentagon spokesman, said the department wouldhave no further comment before Friday at the earliest.   One security source in West Germany, speaking in an interviewwith The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said the``hackers'' tried to break into a large U.S. military computernetwork in West Germany but failed to gain access to secret material.   Police in Hanover arrested two computer hackers on ``suspicion ofespionage activities for an Eastern European intelligence agency,''said Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor'sOffice in Karlsruhe. Another suspect was arrested in West Berlin, hesaid.   ``They are suspected of breaking into foreign computer systems''and selling information to communist agents, Prechtel said.   He said investigators still are trying to determine how muchdamage the suspected espionage had caused to Western securityinterests.   Norddeutsche Rundfunk reported the hackers gained access to a keyU.S. Defense Department computer and to important research computerselsewhere.   They obtained sensitive information that would allow the Sovietsto gain access to the computers, the network said.   Among the computers was the U.S. Defense Department's generaldatabank known as Optimus, a NASA computer, as well as computerstied to nuclear weapons and energy research in New Mexico andIllinois, the network said.   Those facilities are the Los Alamos National Laboratory in LosAlamos, N.M., and the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory nearChicago.   The information also would give the Kremlin access to U.S.military supply depot statistics and to computers belonging toseveral European institutes that deal with atomic and aerospaceresearch, the network statement said.   ``Thousands of computer codes, passwords and programs weredelivered to the Soviets,'' the network said. ``They opened the doorfor the KGB to gain access to some of the most important computercenters of the Western world.''   Norddeutsche Rundfunk said three suspects had been detainedfollowing searches of at least six apartments in West Berlin andHanover. The network also said investigators had seized ``extensiveevidence'' in the searches.   According to the network, authorities believe three West Germanswere recruited by the Soviet KGB in 1985 and ``were paid with cashand drugs ... and were later forced to provide the codes andpasswords to the Soviets.''   The network also said the three handed over ``highly sensitiveinformation from the United States, Japan, Great Britain, France,Italy, Switzerland and West Germany'' at a 1985 meeting with two KGBagents in East Berlin.   Bachmeier said the arrests followed an investigation by thefederal Constitution Protection Office _ the country's maincounterespionage bureau _ as well as criminal investigators and theFederal Prosecutor's Office.</TEXT></DOC>
