The Iranian oil minister came to the first OPEC meetingfollowing the Persian Gulf war pushing the idea of deepenough production cuts to boost oil prices to an average of$21 a barrel. A day later, he was echoing the sentiments ofSaudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer that maybe a muchhigher production level was acceptable after all.</LP><TEXT>   For Iran, it was a stunning departure from a stance ofnearly two decades of promoting higher oil prices. But beyondthat, the Iranian decision to align itself with Saudi Arabiaillustrates some of the rapid transitions taking place inMiddle East power blocs in the wake of the Persian Gulf war.   Saudi Arabia has successfully staked out a 36% share ofOPEC's production, compared with the pre-crisis 25% and isunchallenged as the dominant power in the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries and perhaps in the Middle Eastas well. Iraq, a former rival, likely won't fully recover itslost economic or military luster for at least a generation.Kuwait, which had been a growing competitor as well, now liesin shambles, much of its infrastructure obliterated either bythe U.S.-led assault or vengeful Iraqi sabotage. Iran nowstands as the group's second biggest producer.   For oil consumers, this new order of things bodes well.With Iran's mellowing, pricing moderates have come to theforefront, meaning possible lower fuel costs and a quickerrevival of industrialized economies that are now inrecession. Also, it is likely to help hold down inflationrates in the oil-consuming nations and bring furtherreductions in the burdensome trade deficit of the U.S., whichimports nearly half the oil it uses.   The new Saudi dominance owes much to the U.S. And for thefirst time, the Saudi oil minister had to publicly sufferquestions about the kingdom's allegiance to the U.S. As hestrode into a hotel lobby before the OPEC meeting began, Mr.Nazer heard a booming voice from a crowd of journalists ask,&quot;Has the U.S. set a target price&quot; for OPEC? His reply: &quot;Wealready have a target price.&quot;   But senior OPEC officials, including several leading oilministers, such as Ginandjar Kartasasmita of Indonesia, denythat the U.S. was able to wield any influence on the outcomeof this meeting.   Whatever the U.S. influence, it led to new frictions inthe organization and helped to break up some old alliances.Eventually, it may cost Sadek Boussena of Algeria hisposition as OPEC's president. He has hinted that he doesn'twish to be renamed president at the next OPEC conference,which begins June 4. That may be his way of getting ahead ofthe Saudis, who are expected to block any new bid of his tokeep the president's post.   Irritated by statements made by the Algerian official thatappeared critical of the new Saudi ties to Western nations,the Saudis came into this meeting determined to scuttle mostif not all the new production formulas so carefully craftedseveral weeks ago by a small group of oil ministers led byMr. Boussena.   In an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere dellaSera while the Persian Gulf war still raged, Mr. Boussena hadsaid that while OPEC was going through the most seriouscrisis of its existence it remained a useful organization forthe oil exporters. He added, however, that if some wished totransform its nature to &quot;make it an instrument in the serviceof interests other than those of its members, then each oneof us will have to reassess his position.&quot;   Saudi officials took such comments as a slap in the face.In a government statement issued from Riyadh, the kingdom'scapital, the Saudis charged that if Mr. Boussena was speakingas president of OPEC &quot;he has no right to impose his country'sviews and erroneous propaganda on the other countries, and heisn't competent to speak in OPEC's name in attacking anymember of the organization.&quot;   OPEC strategists close to his delegation suggest Mr.Boussena is being chastised by Saudi Arabia not only for hisremarks but for the pro-Iraq stance taken by Algeria duringthe war. When asked about his flap with the Saudis, he dodgedthe issue responding only, &quot;I have very good relations withmy colleague from Saudi Arabia.&quot;   This rupture of Algerian-Saudi relations is significantfor oil prices because Algeria had been a big supporter ofIran in pushing for higher levels. Saudi Arabia, in turn, hadbeen concerned about the prospects of upheaval in Algeria andhad been providing it not only a great deal of financial aidbut also was willing to entertain its appeals for higherpetroleum prices. But now, says one Saudi official: &quot;We areworrying less about Algeria.&quot;   Last July, Iran had supported Iraq's bid to boost the OPECreference price to $25 from $18 a barrel. But last week, forthe first time in recent OPEC history, Iran turned from itstraditional allies within OPEC to Saudi Arabia, which hadsupported the Iraqis in their bitter eight-year war againstthe Iranians.   &quot;Iran has become pragmatic,&quot; says a Saudi delegate toOPEC. He adds that the Saudis also now see Iran in a newlight -- as part of a three-member alliance includingVenezuela. Adds Gabonese Oil Minister Jean Ping: &quot;Iran is nowmore acceptable as a partner.&quot;   Over the next few years, Iran will need to secureinvestments totaling $27 billion to reconstruct oilfacilities damaged during its war with Iraq as well as tobuild new industries. And Iran's need to dip into foreignsources for financial support comes at the same time thatothers are looking for similar support.   &quot;Now, suddenly Iran is going to have to compete with SaudiArabia, Kuwait and Eastern Europe and eventually Iraq ascapital becomes tighter and tighter,&quot; says BahmanKarbassioun, a Vienna consultant on OPEC.   Some say Iran is moving to fill a vacuum left in thePersian Gulf region by Iraq's defeat. Ahmed Zaki Yamani, theformer Saudi oil minister, is among those who sees &quot;theemergence of Iran as a major military power in the area&quot; asthe base for a stronger position in the region and in OPEC.   Also, Iran stands a much better chance of attracting theforeign investment it needs if it plays a constructive rolein diplomacy in the affairs of the region. &quot;Iran wants toopen up to the West, and Aghazadeh wants to prove he's notthe pariah he was,&quot; says one Middle East expert, an Iraqi.   Iran has dressed up its image during the past year. Gonefrom the meetings are the ideological speeches Mr. Aghazadehused to make against the U.S. and its supporters. These days,he says very little about the West. The wily minister nowbriefs reporters in English rather than his native Farsi.   The Iranian delegation even went so far as to give toselected OPEC attendees boxes of Iranian pistachio nuts boundin designer wrapping paper that was embossed with theofficial seal of the National Iranian Oil Co.</TEXT></DOC>
