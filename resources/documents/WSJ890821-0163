Where were the editorials when Richard Nixon was forgiven what was reported to be greater than $1 million in owed income taxes and penalties? When Ronald and Nancy Reagan were granted an annual stipend of $12 million so, in part, Mrs. Reagan could fly to New York from the California ranch to see her publisher, with her Secret Service men in tow? When pirates' bounties were given to construct presidential libraries, each one more garish than the last? When there was a threefold increase in the executive-office staff after Mr. Reagan's inauguration?    One day we peasants shall rise up, but for now it would be nice if the Journal would tack some of the same principled criticism to Republican presidents who are just as deft at clipping the furniture.
