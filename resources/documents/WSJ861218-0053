That's the arcane, federal income tax that is triggered by a number of items that are deductible on regular tax returns. Targeted at the wealthy, it was added to the tax code in 1978 to ensure that everybody pays a fair share to Uncle Sam. But under the new tax law, it will also trap far more of the unsuspecting, including some who may not consider themselves wealthy.    Up to now, the alternative minimum tax has almost exclusively affected those who take greatest advantage of such tax breaks as the long-term capital-gains exclusion, accelerated depreciation and incentive stock options. Under the separate minimum-tax rules, such deductions and exclusions become &quot;preference items,&quot; which must be taken into account in calculating taxable income.    People who think they might be subject to the minimum tax must figure their tax tab the regular way and using the minimum-tax calculations, and then, in effect, pay whichever is higher. Although the minimum-tax rate is currently 20% and will go to just 21% next year, it allows fewer deductions than the regular tax and, thus, applies to more income.    Having just one preference item or even several doesn't automatically throw an individual into the minimum tax. Most taxpayers needn't be concerned about it this year unless their preference items exceed their regular taxable income.    But as regular tax rates drop, the minimum tax will kick in sooner. For the 1987 tax year, when 38.5% will be the top bracket rate, it will still take preference items amounting to 83.3% of an individual's regular taxable income to trigger the minimum tax. But by 1988, when 28% will be the maximum rate for most people, that threshold percentage of preference items will drop to just 33%.    The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will eliminate one preference item: the 60% of long-term capital gains excluded from regular tax. Starting next year, the exclusion disappears and, with it, the preference item. At the same time, however, the tax act introduces several new preference items and adjustments.    These include the portion of consumer interest that can still be claimed as a deduction for regular tax purposes under the phase-out provisions of the new tax law. For 1987, for example, taxpayers will be permitted to deduct 65% of their interest expense on car loans, credit cards and other consumer credit for regular tax purposes. But none of it will be deductible under the alternative minimum tax.    Also starting next year, &quot;passive losses&quot; (coming from rentals or from business activities where the investor isn't regularly involved in management) can't be used to reduce income from salary, dividends and interest under the minimum tax. This is true even though partial, increasingly smaller deductions will be allowed for regular income-tax filings until 1991, when passive losses can generally be used only to offset passive income.    Another new preference item affects those who make charitable gifts of securities and other appreciated property. The full, fair market value of such gifts can be claimed as a deduction for regular tax purposes. But starting with the 1987 tax year, the appreciation (the amount by which the fair market value exceeds the taxpayer's cost) must be added back to taxable income when computing the alternative minimum tax.    Although most changes take effect next year, a misstep even now could trap the unwary later.    Home-equity loans are a case in point. After this year, the new regular-tax rules will permit homeowners to deduct the interest on second mortgages up to the purchase price of the house plus improvements. Interest on larger amounts will be deductible if that money goes for medical or education expenses.    Under the alternative minimum tax, however, the rules are considerably less generous. The loan has to go toward &quot;substantially rehabilitating&quot; the house. And the amount borrowed can't be more than the existing mortgage; interest on any principal in excess of that becomes a preference item.    As a result, a homeowner who refinances now to pay off a large personal loan or to send a child to college could run into the minimum tax in 1987 or beyond. &quot;To the extent you rely too heavily on home-interest deductions, you'll be flipped into the minimum tax,&quot; says Mary Hevener, a Washington lawyer formerly with the Treasury Department. &quot;That's going to catch a lot of people by itself.&quot;    Tax planning under the alternative minimum tax can be numbingly complex. However, those who do their own regular taxes with just the aid of a calculator can make at least a rough estimate.    The starting point for the minimum-tax calculation is the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. This must be increased by adding applicable tax preference items.    Only a handful of itemized deductions are permitted, including medical expenses and casualty losses that exceed 10% of adjusted gross income. Deductions for state and local income taxes and real estate taxes aren't allowed.    The remaining amount is then reduced by standard exemptions. Under current law, the exemptions are $40,000 for married taxpayers who file a joint return and $30,000 for single taxpayers.    Starting with the 1987 tax year, however, the exemptions will be reduced and even eliminated for some well-heeled taxpayers. For married taxpayers filing jointly, the exemption will be reduced by 25% of the amount that minimum taxable income exceeds $150,000; for single taxpayers, the exemption will be reduced by 25% of the amount that minimum taxable income exceeds $112,500. Thus, the exemption disappears entirely for married taxpayers with incomes of $310,000 or more and for single taxpayers with income of $232,500 or more.    The amount remaining after the exemption is the alternative minimum taxable income. This is subject to a 20% tax for 1986 and a 21% tax thereafter. The resulting tax is compared with the taxpayer's regular tax liability, after certain credits.    Going beyond the estimate requires delving further into the complexities of the new minimum-tax rules.    Although the law for 1986 treats all preference items the same, the new law divides them into two classes. Most of the items become &quot;deferral preferences&quot; -- so-called because they don't permanently reduce taxes. These items will produce credits that can be used in future years when a taxpayer pays regular income tax. The credits can't be carried back, however, to reduce taxes already paid.    The few &quot;exclusion preferences&quot; that won't generate credits include certain regular-tax deductions, such as state income taxes and medical expenses. The others are the untaxed appreciation in charitable gifts of appreciated property, tax-exempt interest on so-called &quot;private-activity&quot; municipal bonds issued after last Aug. 7, and the excess depletion allowance in oil and gas investments.    ---           Worksheet for Estimating the Minimum Tax                               1986 ESTIMATE   1987 ESTIMATE   Adjusted gross income*      $               $    Add tax preference items:   Dividend exclusion   Excess cost recovery or      accelerated depreciation      deductions   Bargain element realized      on exercise of incentive      stock options   Excess intangible drilling      costs   Percentage depletion      deduction in excess of      the property's adjusted      basis   Portion of losses from      passive activities      reflected in adjusted      gross income   Excess of charitable      contribution deduction      (at fair market value)      over cost basis for      property contributed   Tax-exempt interest on      private-activity bonds      issued after 8/7/86   Other preferences   Subtract certain deductions      and exemption:   Charitable contributions,      casualty losses,      medical and interest      expenses, and exemption**   Alternative minimum      taxable income   Tax Rate                            20%              21%   Alternative minimum      tax liability#            $               $   *Any net operating loss included in adjusted gross incomerequires a special computation.   **Medical expenses and casualty losses are deductible onlyto the extent they exceed 10% of adjusted gross income.Qualified housing interest and other interest is deductibleto the extent of net investment income.
