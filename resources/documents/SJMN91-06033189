Joseph Wahed, chief economist for WellsFargo Bank in San Francisco, said the Fed's action by itself won't restoreconsumer and business confidence.;    &quot;A lot of people know we are inrecession and are pulling back,&quot; Wahed said. &quot;To convince businesses to addpeople and expand, they need either solid evidence of improvement or the costof money has to be so low it's too good to be true. Interest rates haven'tdropped far enough to entice them yet.&quot;;    &quot;I think the war has to end&quot;before people will begin spending again, said Jerry L. Jordan, chief economistat First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles.;    The pessimistic view of theeconomy, based largely on the government's release Friday of new,disappointing data about employment and manufacturers' purchases, is quite acontrast to the judgment that prevailed only a week or two ago when economistswere saying the worst of the recession might be over.;    &quot;These numbers areso devastating that they suggest the worst is ahead of us and not behind us,&quot;said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., a Wall Streetbond firm. They show that &quot;the recession could carry through to next year,&quot; headded.;    The Labor Department reported Friday that unemployment rose to 6.2percent in January, the highest level since 1987; that payrolls, not countingfarm workers, fell by 232,000 jobs, and that the average workweek shrank by ahalf hour.;    California's jobless rate increased from 6.8 percent inDecember to 7 percent in January, the highest level in 4 1/2 years, the stateEmployment Development Department reported.;    State EDD Director AliceGonzales described the increase as troubling, but said it could have beenworse.;    &quot;This month, at least, the accompanying numbers showed only a verysmall labor market change. Unemployment was up 29,000, while the number ofpeople with jobs is down by 14,000,&quot; she said.;    The combination of badeconomic news and the Federal Reserve's actions caused interest rates in thecredit markets to plunge, but the stock market appeared to focus more oncorporate profits and fell slightly.;    Within minutes of the LaborDepartment's release of the employment figures Friday morning, the FederalReserve announced that it had cut the discount rate to 6 percent, from 6 1/2percent.;    This is the rate the central bank charges on loans to commercialbanks. Since banks rarely borrow from the Federal Reserve these days unlessthey are in serious trouble, the discount rate is important mainly as a signalof policy intentions.;    Later in the morning, the Federal Reserve boughtlarge quantities of government securities to indicate to the financial marketsthat it wanted to lower its target for the crucial federal funds rate,apparently to 6 1/4 percent, from 6 3/4 percent.;    This is the ratecommercial banks charge one another for overnight loans and is often adetermining factor in the rates they offer customers. It was the secondhalf-point cut in the rate in six weeks.;    In Alan Greenspan's 3 1/2 yearsas chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve has almostalways limited changes in the funds rate target to one-quarter of a percentagepoint at a time.;    This was the first time the Federal Reserve changed thediscount rate and the federal funds rate target on the same day.;    Largecommercial banks, including Citibank and J.P. Morgan in New York, the FirstNational Bank of Chicago and BankAmerica Corp. in San Francisco, immediatelyreduced their prime rate to 9 percent, from 9 1/2 percent, and other large andsmall banks will surely follow suit.;    &quot;The employment numbers were sodreadful that the Fed had no choice but to respond immediately with decisive,unambiguous action,&quot; said Robert H. Chandross, chief economist in the New Yorkoffice of Lloyds Bank PLC.;    The Federal Reserve's actions also reflected areport by a private group, the National Association of Purchasing Management,showing that its purchasing managers' index had fallen to its lowest levelsince May 1982, in the midst of the last recession.;    Jones, who has justcompleted a book on the Federal Reserve under Greenspan, says the chairmanpays especially close attention to the monthly purchasing index, whichmeasures what manufacturers are buying.; Friday's economic highlights; (box)The Fed announced it was cutting its discount rate, the interest it charges onloans to commercial banks, from 6.5 percent to 6 percent.; (box)Several majorbanks cut their prime lending rate from 9.5 percent to 9 percent.; (box)Thecivilian unemployment rate in January hit a 3 1/2-year high of 6.2 percent.;(box)California's jobless rate increased from 6.8 percent in December to 7percent in January, the highest level in 4 1/2 years.; (box)The NationalAssociation of Purchasing Management said its monthly index of economicactivity dropped sharply to 37.7 percent from 40.5 percent in December.;(box)Construction spending slid for a ninth straight month in December,falling 0.5 percent. For the year, building growth was just 0.6 percent.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910202  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  960  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday February 2, 199100033189,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
