Levine, the convicted Wall Streetinsider trader whose exposure led to a major scandal, is briefingbusiness school students these days on the consequences ofwhite-collar crime.   Under tight secrecy and a ban on reporters, Levine on Thursdaytold a story of greed and power gone awry to about 90 ColumbiaBusiness School students.   ``He said it's very easy in such a heady exciting atmospheresimply to lose yourself in the enormously competitive race,'' saidJames Kuhn, who teaches ethics at Columbia and attended Levine'sspeech. ``He now realizes it was a major source of his downfall.''   Levine, 36, was paroled last year from a two-year jail term forsecurities fraud, tax evasion and perjury. He had admitted making$12.6 million in a five-year insider trading scheme by usingillegally obtained information about pending corporate takeovers.   Levine's squealings led federal authorities to Ivan Boesky, thenow-imprisoned speculator who used illegal information peddled byLevine to make millions himself.   Dressed in a dark suit like the investment banker he once was,Levine spoke for about 20 minutes at Columbia then answered studentquestions for more than an hour, people in attendance said.   He was brought to campus with the business school dean's approvalby a student group devoted to business ethics. Levine wasn't paidfor his appearance, Columbia officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
