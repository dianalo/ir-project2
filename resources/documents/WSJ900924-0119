A woman balancing a baby on her back and asheet of corrugated iron on her head disappears into themess. It is her home.   &quot;Squatters,&quot; says Mr. Jack. &quot;Four or five weeks ago, thoseshacks weren't there.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The battlefield inspection continues. Unemployed men, bothyoung and old, loiter in small groups on every corner. Flimsyshanties, some merely a patchwork of cardboard billboards --&quot;whiter whites, brighter brights,&quot; says a detergent ad nowpart of a living room wall -- occupy every available space.   Mr. Jack winces at the price of victory. &quot;Sanctions,&quot; headmits, &quot;have required a sacrifice.&quot;   South Africa's present recession, hastened byinternational trade and financial sanctions against Pretoriafor its policies of racial segregation, has hit the blightedblack townships of Port Elizabeth particularly hard. So hascorporate disinvestment. When Ford and General Motors lefttown four years ago, 6,500 people lost their jobs. Most ofthem are still unemployed today.   Mr. Jack turns another corner. More jobless, moresquatters, more shacks. &quot;We must act quickly to end thissacrifice,&quot; he says. &quot;We don't want to inherit a country inruins.&quot;   The sanctions sword is turning against its blacksmith. TheAfrican National Congress, South Africa's main blackliberation group, forged its sanctions strategy as a means ofpressuring the government to abandon white-minority rule.And, to this end, it has worked. Earlier this year, PresidentF.W. de Klerk, desperate to return South Africa tointernational acceptability, unbanned the ANC and otherpolitical groups, released ANC leader Nelson Mandela from 27years in prison, began repealing segregation laws and openednegotiations with the ANC designed to lead to a newconstitution and black-white power sharing. Today Mr. deKlerk, carrying a report on his reforms, will be the firstSouth African head of state to visit the White House innearly half a century.   Having thus prodded the government into action, sanctionsnow are prodding the ANC. Back home after 30 years in exile,the ANC is swamped with its impoverished constituency'srising expectations for improved living conditions. The ANC,now a partner with the government in shaping the country'sfuture, is eager to restructure the economy to better meetblack needs, an overhaul that will rely heavily on foreigninvestment. But it can't begin as long as measures designedto punish the economy and isolate South Africa are still inplace. And many countries, such as the U.S., have locked intheir sanctions until the ANC says it is satisfied withcurrent negotiations between the government and the blackopposition.   Thus, the ANC finds itself under pressure to move asswiftly as possible in the talks; it hopes significantprogress can be made by the end of the year. To boostnegotiation prospects, the ANC last month took the initiativeto suspend its guerrilla war. Mr. Mandela also says theorganization may settle for a &quot;statement of intent&quot; from thegovernment on the shape of a new constitution, rather thanactual progress, as a trigger for the lifting of sanctions.   &quot;The realization of the damage that sanctions would do tothe economy, and to social stability, if they continue to beapplied has brought both the government and the ANC to theirsenses,&quot; says Ronald Bethlehem, an economist at one of thecountry's big mining houses. &quot;Neither are prepared to acceptthe long-term costs of sanctions.&quot;   After more than five years of sanctions, applied invarying degrees by individual countries, and after a hugeexodus of direct investment by U.S. corporations, the costsare adding up. The cutting off of financial credits from themajor Western banks has triggered a net capital outflow ofmore than $10 billion, mainly through debt repayment. Effortsto hold down imports to finance these payments have strangledgrowth. Black unemployment, high even before sanctions anddisinvestment, is rising by at least 200,000 a year. Withoutforeign aid, development programs, such as low-cost housing,are sputtering. More than seven million squatters, fullyone-quarter of the black population, encircle the country'surban areas.   In some ways, the First World component of the economy --driven by the white-owned gold, diamond and platinum mines --has perversely benefited from sanctions. Local companies andbusinessmen snapped up disinvesting companies at fire-saleprices. New trade routes, plied by sanctions-bustingentrepreneurs, opened almost as soon as others closed. Thecountry's export base actually widened, thanks to governmentincentives. Industries neglected in the past have blossomed;in response to the arms embargo against it, the country hasbecome one of the world's largest weapons makers.   The net result has been to widen the already huge gapbetween whites and blacks. The staggering black unemployment-- more than 50% in some areas -- has sharpened workplacetensions; more than 1.2 million man-days were lost during thefirst half of this year because of strikes, triple the levelof last year. Moreover, the housing crisis is fuelingtownship unrest. Squatter camps and migrant labor dormitorieshave been the flashpoints of the recent orgy of politicalviolence, which has left nearly 800 blacks dead.   &quot;I shudder when I see the black economy,&quot; says RogerMatlock, the Port Elizabeth director of the Urban Foundation,a privately funded development agency working toward apost-apartheid South Africa. &quot;It has never been worse.&quot;   That certainly is true at the S.O.S. Old Aged Soup Kitchenfor the Needy Children.   Long gone are the glorious days when a surprise deliveryof hot food from the Ford canteen would add a veritable feastto the usual ladel of soup. These days it's just soup andbread, bread and soup. The old wood-burning stove donated byGeneral Motors in 1981 has seen better days. And when, wonderthe old women of the neighborhood, was the last time theygathered for a sewing bee, turning the automakers' scrapcloth and leather into dresses and Bible covers? The memoryfades.   &quot;My Americans, they looked after me,&quot; says 87-year-oldDaisy Davids as she shows off the GM stove puffing away atthe foot of her bed in her rickety two-room shack in the&quot;colored,&quot; or mixed race, part of Port Elizabeth. &quot;I was sosorry to see them go.&quot;   Ford left town lock, stock and hubcap in 1985, firstmerging with a Pretoria-based auto maker, then disinvestingentirely. General Motors left a year later by selling tolocal managers. The departures were hailed by anti-apartheidactivists as the crowning glories of the disinvestmentcampaign. But they devastated Port Elizabeth, which at thetime was known as the Detroit of South Africa.   GM's successor, Delta Motors, is making a profit,something that eluded GM here for years, but it is doing sowith about 1,500 fewer workers. Ford left 5,000 peopleunemployed. The companies' contributions to communitydevelopment programs vanished. In the cruelest irony, Ford'srecreation center near the black townships was taken over bythe police; some activists who among other things advocateddisinvestment were later detained and interrogated there.   Mrs. Davids sits on a chair in front of her shack andsquints at the bottom line. &quot;The government is finallytalking to our people. This is very good,&quot; she says. &quot;Butwhat about my children?&quot; Inside, two bags of powdered souplean against a wall, below a painting of the Last Supper.   Her &quot;children,&quot; some of them sons and daughters of formerFord and GM workers, flock to the S.O.S. kitchen from theschool across the street. For most, a cup of soup will betheir only hot meal of the day.   &quot;I feel it is my duty to worry about them,&quot; says Mrs.Davids. &quot;Nobody else does.&quot; Suddenly, her tired eyes brightenwith a flash of optimism. &quot;My Americans,&quot; she wonders, &quot;doyou think they will ever come back?&quot;   Across town, Welfit Oddy no longer worries about thatquestion. One of the area's prominent white businessmen, heleans back in his office chair, satisfied that he has beatenall that the world beyond South Africa's borders can throw athim. Disinvestment and sanctions should have ruined him.Instead, he is prospering as never before.   &quot;I remember saying back then that a lot of people willbenefit from this,&quot; he says now.   In 1985, his family's company, which began as a wagonbuilder in Port Elizabeth nearly a century ago, was making150 bodies a day for Ford pickups and trucks. It was 25% ofhis business and, based on assurances from Ford that itwouldn't disinvest, he had just built a new factory. But Fordwent anyway.   &quot;It was a shock,&quot; he says. &quot;The country was in the middleof a recession, and then they take off.&quot; He cut his workforce and scrambled to diversify away from the auto industry.As his losses mounted, he settled on the production ofstainless steel transport containers. He found an exportmarket and business has boomed.   &quot;If Ford hadn't gone and this opportunity presenteditself, I might have sat back and said, `No, I'm quitehappy.' As it is, I'm pleased Ford went,&quot; says Mr. Oddy.&quot;When the whole world is against you, you've got to survive.&quot;   Outside the factory gates, the squatter shacks from theblack township across the road continue their inexorableadvance toward his property. The mixed-race community down inthe valley is in flames; riots over living conditions willkill more than 40 over the next two days. Production suffersas workers take off to defend their homes. Meanwhile, therecently unbanned South African Communist Party canvasses thefactory floor with the rhetoric of &quot;workers control.&quot;   Mr. Oddy manages a withering smile. Is it possible, hewonders, to beat the world but lose at home?   In the cold office of the Unemployed Workers Union indowntown Port Elizabeth, ten black men, who know all aboutlosing, sit upright and proud on white plastic chairs. In theanti-apartheid crusade, some of their comrades were killed,others were imprisoned, many went into exile. These men losttheir jobs. They were all Ford workers.   &quot;We aren't ashamed of sanctions. It is our contribution tothe struggle,&quot; says Michael Qwesha, a young man withdreadlocks flowing from beneath a black beret. The beret isembroidered with the hammer and sickle logo of the SouthAfrican Communist Party; a button -- &quot;ANC leads, ANC lives&quot;-- dangles from his sweater. After he lost his job, he says,he was arrested and detained without charge for three yearsfor his anti-apartheid activity. He has been free, andunemployed, for a year now.   &quot;Whatever steps the government has taken,&quot; he says, &quot;havebeen because of us, the masses.&quot;   But beneath the pride there is ironic bitterness. Inunison, the men say that Ford and GM and all the otherdisinvesting companies were right to leave, but wrong in theway they did it. The severance packages, they grumble,weren't enough to compensate for the coming years ofunemployment.   &quot;During our time of working we never had anything to save,anything to put away,&quot; says Johnny Mke, who worked for Fordfor 22 years. Adds Prince Parlie: &quot;They didn't give us anywarning. We were building our future, our children's future,on Ford.&quot;   That is the problem with capitalists, says Patrick Shwempeof the Unemployed Workers Union, which seeks to organize thejobless into a political force. &quot;Unemployment wasn't justcaused by sanctions and disinvestment, although that added toit,&quot; he says. &quot;Unemployment is a creation of capitalism, tohold over the heads of workers who want to strike.&quot;   Still, the 10 men would welcome the capitalists backtomorrow. They are eager to get back to work. &quot;We have theskills they need,&quot; says Mr. Mke. &quot;We can be the Detroit ofSouth Africa again.&quot;   It is the ANC that now must contend with these risingexpectations.   &quot;Every resident in the area is expecting an ANC governmentto quickly improve the situation,&quot; says Michael Xego, theANC's publicity officer in the Port Elizabeth area. &quot;But noone can expect the shacks, the unemployment, to just go away,poof, overnight.&quot;   Where once the ANC sought to exploit the impoverishedtownship conditions to create social instability --&quot;ungovernability&quot; was the revolutionary word -- it is nowdesperate to maintain stability. &quot;We are going to inheritmost of the problems here,&quot; says Michael Ndube of the ANC'syouth branch.   He catalogs the poverty around him. Unemployment isrunning at 50%. An average of 20 families a day are movinginto the city, each looking for a job and a house. Theshortage of classrooms is so severe that existing schools arebeing used in shifts; one group of students in the morning,another in the afternoon.   &quot;We have to do things now,&quot; says Mr. Jack, turning upanother street and explaining why the ANC decided to suspendits armed struggle ahead of all its demands being met. &quot;If wedelay, things only get worse.&quot;   Another corner, another squatter neighborhood. &quot;It's verydifficult giving the ordinary people what they need withlimited resources,&quot; he says. &quot;The needs of our people are sogreat.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
