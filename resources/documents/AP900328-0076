Soldiers and police patrolled Natal in an effort to quell theviolence, which broke out Tuesday and has killed at least twopeople.   ``The whole so-called `Valley of Death' is covered with bluesmoke. I saw 120 homes burning at the same time in a radius of (15miles),'' said journalist Khaba Mkhize after flying over theEdendale Valley near the provincial capital of Pietermaritzburg.   From 1,000 feet up, Mkhize saw crowds of more than 1,000gathering in streets and bodies lying in fields.   Police reported two deaths and 25 injuries since Tuesday butexpected the figures would rise. Local reporters, who did not wantto be named, said up to 14 people had been killed.   As night fell, officials and monitors reported 1,500 peoplefleeing the townships with their belongings loaded onto trucks.   Army units and extra police were deployed after some 2,000 Zulussupporting the Inkatha party went on rampage with guns and knivesagainst supporters of the rival United Democratic Front. Observersand police say the violence was sparked by the stoning of Inkathabuses that drove through UDF areas after a rally Sunday.   Inkatha is fighting the UDF for control of the region. Bothgroups oppose apartheid, South Africa's system of racialsegregation. However, Inkatha supports separate states fordifferent tribes or ethnic groups, while the UDF wants a blackmajority government ruling all of South Africa.   Police said officers used shotguns and tear gas to disperse mobsattacking and burning houses. Maj. Piet Kitching said the armywould patrol all night along major routes in the 120-square-milearea where fighting was reported.   ``It almost looks as though the whole area is burning,'' saidKitching.   ``In a field, on one side of a hill a battle was raging, wecould hear the guns,'' said Peter Kerchhoff, of a Pietermaritzburgpeace group. ``On the other side, we just heard the weapons beingfired amongst the trees. Masses of people were watching theconfrontations and masses of people were ... trying to go to therescue of other people in conflict on the hill.''   Kerchhoff said dirt roads leading to townships were blockadedwith tree trunks, boulders, rubbish and burning tires. He saidpeople were fleeing Caluza township, where much of the fighting wascentered. Houses were burning in several townships, and many ofthose fleeing carried with them pieces of furniture, he said.   As his group drove through the crowds taking four injured to thehospital, Kerchhoff said, ``People were saying, `Please, we needguns.'''   Several residents and local journalists said they saw somepolice giving Inkatha fighters ammunition, supporting them in thebattles, and refusing to confiscate their weapons. Townshipresidents welcomed the army's arrival, said Mkhize, the journalist.   A 13-year-old boy in a house in Caluza said over the telephone:``The police is coming and shoot the people. A helicopter is upthere.''   The boy, who could not be identified because of safety concerns,said his father had left the house ``because of the war'' and ``Iam running away now.''   Kerchhoff said he saw young and old men fighting on a distanthilltop with sticks, clubs and machete-like knives called pangas.Among the Inkatha fighters, Kerchhoff said he saw men in blueuniforms, but he could not be sure they were police.   One of the injured he transported to a hospital claimed to havebeen shot in the shoulder by police officer, Kerchhoff said.   Police did not respond to the charges, but photographers tookpictures of white security policemen, riot squad officers and localblack police in the company of armed Inkatha men near Caluza.   Hundreds of people have been killed in black factional fightingin recent weeks in Natal. Nearly 4,000 have died since 1987 as theInkatha movement and UDF fight for control of the region.   The groups have ignored repeated appeals from Nelson Mandela andother black leaders to end the fighting.</TEXT></DOC>
