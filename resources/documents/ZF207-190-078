Katt.andM;A record number of tippling tattlers made the pilgrimage to the Katt's swank25th-floor penthouse high atop the Ritz-Carlton to share wine, hors d'oeuvresand, of course, their secrets.andM;Only 80386-based PS/2s -- Models 70 and 80 -- will benefit from IBM's firstenhancements to the original PS/2 architecture, said one party crasher, justbefore he fell asleep on the couch.andM;One particularly shy guest whispered that IBM's long-awaited customer-rebateplan to spur OS/2 sales finally kicks off May 2.andP;  He added that IBM helpeddevise Microsoft's OS/2 marketing reorganization, as inattention to suchcritical details as applications-development tools and device drivers hadbegun to take its toll.andM;Rapt Rap with RepandM;Seeking peace amid the revelry, Spencer and an IBM sales rep took shelter ina bathroom to review the rep's newly minted ''Why PS/2?'' marketing pitch.andO;The Katt quickly spotted a point the rep should stress: The MCA box was builtto absorb the hellish radio frequency interference that accompanies clockspeeds of 50MHz and beyond.andP;  Runaway RFI, the inevitability of which EISAofficials rarely address, fouls up a computer system like it does yourneighbor's TV.andM;Meanwhile, the Katt's pajama party outside had built to a feverish crescendo.andO;Dan Crane will be the new president of Borland, came a voice from under thespiral staircase.andP;  Philippe loves a guy with a sense of humor who also makesthe numbers work.andP;  And, incidentally, the new Quattro will be called QuattroProfessional and will debut in June.andM;Ashton-Tate is about to go private, predicted the bartender.andP;  Wall Streetwon't have Ed Esber to kick around anymore, he said, once Bear, Stearns wrapsup the deal next month.andM;Had anyone seen dBASE running on the VAX over at the McCormick Hotel?andP;  No,and no one cared to.andM;Felix, the piano player, noted that Chips andamp; Technologies has just aboutcompleted its legal Mac clone chip set, and system software is not farbehind.andP;  He wondered aloud whether Chips has pockets deep enough to withstandthe legal blitzkrieg Apple is sure to launch.andM;Long after the guests and even the Ritz's three-man clean-up squad had gone,a lone IBMer remained to share a 2 a.m.andP;  snifter with the baggy-eyed Katt,who asked, ''Why in God's name did IBM release the PS/2 and OS/2 when it did,now that we know that critical third-party support for both IBM initiativeswas still years away?''andM;His friend gazed out at an illuminated Soldier Field.andP;  ''Two reasons,'' hesaid.andP;  ''First, we hadn't shipped squat in two years, while Compaq hadannounced some really nice '286 and '386 machines.andP;  The pressure inside IBMwas tremendous to ship something, anything.andM;''Secondly,'' he said, ''it was the Year of the Customer, remember?andP;  Ourcustomers needed to know our plans so that they could make their own plans.andO;I guess we just didn't think things through.''andM;Nobody's perfect, including Spencer, who still has not delivered on hispreannounced Spencer gym bags.andP;  Spare supplies of the crimson Spencernightshirts given out at the party await those tipsters who couldn't eludehotel security that night, or who may have just learned the specs on IBM'snew RISC machines.andM;Unburden yourself to the Wired One at (617) 375-4000, or his MCI executivesuite, SKATT.. .andP;  .
