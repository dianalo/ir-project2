That's because the WhiteHouse has just discovered that the executive branch isn'tdoomed to acting like a pitiful, helpless giant.   The administration has been discussing an argument, whichholds that President Bush can issue a regulation on his ownto index capital gains. This would end the absurdity of a taxon &quot;gain&quot; defined as the difference between the purchase andselling prices, even if inflation eroded the dollar fasterthan the property appreciated.</LP><TEXT>   This idea emanated out of the Justice Department's policyshop and first appeared last week in a Washington Timescolumn by Paul Craig Roberts. It is based on the distinctionbetween laws passed by Congress and regulations issued solelyby the executive branch.   The argument here is that President Bush has the authorityto index capital gains because the procedures for measuringgains are determined by regulation, not by law. Congress, ofcourse, never said that capital gains must be defined as theinflated gains (the reasons for its reluctance to say soexplicitly are fairly obvious).   The tax law itself says only that taxes must be paid ongains as measured by the increase from the &quot;basis&quot; a taxpayerhas in the property. The code defines the basis from whichtaxes must later be paid as &quot;the cost of such property,&quot; butthe cost isn't defined as real or nominal. Treasury ruleshave treated the basis as nominal, but a new regulation couldinclude an adjustment for inflation. The same argument couldbe used to index depreciation schedules, which could furtherboost real-estate values and save many banks.   There is a long history of executive-branch departmentsand agencies interpreting vague statutes; for details, thelawyers can check out Chevron v. Natural Resources DefenseCouncil (1984). The Bob Jones University case in 1982 arosewhen the IRS by regulation blocked charitable status forracist schools. (We've made the related argument that thePresident also has the inherent impoundment and line-itemveto powers.) It's also unlikely that anyone would havestanding to sue to block indexing.   It would be an enormously productive and popular move ifMr. Bush decides to index capital gains. Just as inflationled to bracket creep on personal income-tax rates beforeCongress passed indexing starting in 1985, indexing capitalgains would be the equivalent of a tax cut. The mostappropriate time to announce such a policy, of course, wouldbe this evening. It would be a bold move, which would benefitboth the economy and Mr. Bush.</TEXT></DOC>
