Chilean fruit exporters have seen a substantial increase fromprevious years in early orders from U.S. grocery chains, said DavidHolzworth, a Washington attorney who represents the ChileanExporters Association.   ``The biggest silver lining (of the cyanide scare) for theindustry has been the recognition by retailers of how importantChilean fruit was to their produce sales,'' Holzworth said.   He said produce sales for some of the large grocery chains wereoff as much as 25 percent last March and April as a result of thepoisoning scare that kept Chilean fruit off the shelves for severalweeks.   ``The importance of the products to the retail industry has comehome,'' he said. ``So we're looking at a very good year so far as aresult of that recognition.''   The new season is proceeding under a cooperative agreementsigned by Chilean and U.S. officials that formalizes emergencyprocedures to ensure the safety of fresh fruit exported from Chile.   The memorandum of understanding outlines steps the two countrieswould take to handle an emergency like the cyanide scare, shouldanother occur.   Several ships have arrived in U.S. ports recently, bringingearly shipments from Chile, but the FDA sees no need to institutespecial procedures for monitoring the produce, officials said.   ``As far as Chilean fruit is concerned, we are in routinecoverage of the fruit,'' said Richard Davis, FDA's regionaldirector in Philadelphia.   ``We normally would collect samples of fruit to be analyzed forpesticides and we would also check for the presence of sulfites,which is used as a preservative for grapes and only a certainamount of it is allowed.''   He added that the FDA is applying ``the same rules to Chileanfruit as to any other fruit.''   The scare began March 12, when the FDA announced that it hadfound traces of cyanide in two grapes from Chile. Earlier in themonth, an anonymous caller to the U.S. embassy in the Chileancapital of Santiago had threatened to inject cyanide in exportfruit.   The FDA ordered Chilean fruit held in ports where it was cominginto the United States, urged stores to remove the fruit from theirshelves and began a series of special inspections to determinewhether any more fruit was contaminated.   No other fruit was found to be tainted, but millions of dollarsworth of fruit had to be dumped because it had gone bad while itwas withheld from the market during the inspections. At the time,Chilean exporters and U.S. importers said they lost about $240million because of the health scare.   The impact on the Chilean fruit industry is still being felt.Holzworth said many small companies have gone out of business orhave been bought out by larger companies.   Grapes constitute about 70 percent of the fruit Chile exports,and virtually all of the fresh grapes sold in the United Statesduring the winter months are from Chile.   Chile exported nearly 44 million crates of fruit to the UnitedStates and Canada last winter, and 6 million crates had to bedumped.   This year, if the harvest continues to be good, Chileanexporters expect to send as much as 48 million crates of fruit tothe United States and Canada, Holzworth said, and ``what you'll seeis the best of the best.''   Exporters will be sending to U.S. markets ``the premium qualityfruit ... to make sure the initial market acceptance will behigh,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
