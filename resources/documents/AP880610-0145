(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eight members of the environmentalgroup Greenpeace were arrested today for boarding an Icelandicfishing vessel in Gloucester Harbor to protest that nation'swhaling industry.   The protesters, riding to the ship aboard their trademarkinflatable motorboats known as ``Zodiacs,'' boarded the fishingvessel Jokulfell as it docked at the Americold Corp., a freezercompany on Gloucester's inner harbor.   The protesters climbed on board using ladders and ropes andinformed the crew of 14 what they were there for and then proceededto hang several banners on the ship. There were no injuries orviolence. But three of the protesters chained themselves to hatchesor gangways and had to be cut loose by police, Gloucester policesaid.   The aim of the protest was to put economic pressure on Icelandto end whaling. Protesters said they were trying to prevent theship from unloading, even though the cargo contained no whale meat.They also hope to pressure American buyers, particularly fast-foodchains, to stop buying Icelandic fish.   Michael DeChiara, a Greenpeace member, said: ``We're puttingeconomic pressure on Iceland selling fish to the U.S. We're doingall we can to stop whaling.''   Greenpeace alleges that Iceland has been killing whales forcommercial use under the guise of scientific research. It saysIceland for two years has defied an International WhalingCommission request to stop whaling activities.   Most recently, the request was made at Auckland, New Zealand,two weeks ago by the commission, according to Campbell Plowden,Greenpeace's whale campaign coordinator.   Gloucester police and members of the U.S. Coast Guard boardedthe ship and took eight of the demonstrators into custody afterthey scaled a massive crane used in unloading. The demonstratorswere able to unfurl a large banner reading, ``Save the whales,boycott Icelandic fish, Greenpeace.''   The protesters were charged with unlawful boarding of a vesseland tresspassing and were scheduled to be arraigned in GloucesterDistrict Court sometime today, according to Sgt. David Reardon ofthe Gloucester police.</TEXT></DOC>
