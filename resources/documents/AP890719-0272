SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today hedisagrees with a Bush administration proposal to lift restrictionson exporting personal computers to Soviet bloc nations.   ``I do not support that decision,'' Cheney told reporters.   ``My concern is that it will give them a computer capability thathas military applications. That should be avoided,'' the secretarysaid.   ``It gives them significant capabilities they do not nowpossess,'' he said.   Cheney termed inaccurate a Washington Post report that he hadbeen persuaded to withdraw Pentagon objections to the proposalduring a meeting with Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher.   The decision reportedly came after a fierce debate among the topmembers of President Bush's Cabinet.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, told of Cheney's remarks,noted that Bush supports the decision on the computers.   The Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it was removingexport controls on AT-compatible and similar desk-top personalcomputers to non-communist nations.   It said the administration will also propose to the 17-nationCoordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) thatexport restrictions be lifted against the Soviet bloc nations.   Cheney said he would prefer that exports be permitted for ``alower level of technology.''   Mosbacher, in a statement released Tuesday, said Bush's trip toPoland and Hungary had ``paved the way for expanding trade in areasthat improve prospects for prosperity in Eastern Europe withoutharming America's national security.''   ``Eliminating export controls on AT-compatible personal computersis one way to meet this objective,'' he said. ``Consistent with thespirit of the president's initiatives, we are creating newopportunities for U.S. manufacturers to sell more widely abroad.''   The AT is an IBM model that was widely emulated.   The department said regulations removing the controls on exportsto Western nations will appear in the Federal Register on July 18and be effective immediately.   The COCOM committee, based in Paris, consists of Australia,Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, West Germany, Greece,Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain,Turkey and the United States.   ``The net result of this decontrol is to focus and maintainexport restrictions on those items that are truly strategic, andthat we can control effectively,'' Mosbacher said.   ``In this case, these computers are available in 11 countries andfrom 70 vendors outside COCOM countries,'' he added. Those countriesinclude Hungary and Czechoslovakia in the East Bloc.   The department said there were about 6 million AT-compatible desktop personal computers sold worldwide by U.S. companies in 1988. Ofthose, 2.7 million worth more than $1 billion were sold outside theUnited States.</TEXT></DOC>
