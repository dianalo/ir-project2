The rating concern cited Coca-Cola's prospects for cash flow from its soft drink franchises. It also said it will continue to assess the effects of acquisitions and the stock buyback. Moody's confirmed its double-A-2 rating on the company's shelf registration debt, Euronotes and Eurobonds and its Prime-1 rating on commercial paper. Also confirmed was the double-A-2 rating on Euronotes of Coca-Cola International Finance N.V. and Coca-Cola Financial Corp. The Prime-1 rating on Cola-Cola Financial's commercial paper was unchanged.    ---   CRAZY EDDIE INC. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded $81 million of subordinated debentures of this Edison, N.J.-based consumer-electronics chain to single-B-3 from single-B-1, citing the company's reduced profitability, recent acquisition proposals that could increase its leverage and an uncertain earnings outlook. Crazy Eddie, the target of two recent buyout bids, last week posted a loss for the first time since going public in 1984. &quot;Cash flow, which is heavily dependent upon earnings, will not provide for significant reductions in debt,&quot; Moody's said. &quot;As a result, leverage will remain high, even if Crazy Eddie is not acquired.&quot; A company spokesman declined to comment on the rating change. </TEXT></DOC>
