Samples were taken for incubation from thesurface and 1 and 2 m depth in each case. The methods used gave a goodindication of species composition of the viable seed banks. Analysisrevealed significant effects of age and depth on total seed numbers,as well as an interaction between the two. The results are discussedin relation to conditions in the stores, with implications for subsequentre-vegetation of the reinstated topsoil. 16 refs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
