Coal is an important primary energy source becauseof the availability of reserves. Biomass resources are renewable andmay provide a valuable alternative source to petroleum. This book presentsa review of the present status of those synfuel production technologieswhich have reached a sufficient stage of development. Both coal and biomassare considered for the production of both gaseous fuels (low-energy gas,methane, etc.) and liquid fuels (alcohols, synthetic hydrocarbons, etc.).The use of synfuels in automobile engines is also dealt with, as arevarious aspects of environmental pollution. The economics of syntheticfuels, possibilities for market penetration, and current projects arealso explored.</TEXT></DOC>
