News reports today said an additional 21 people died inaccidents caused by the floods, bringing the total known death tollto more than 90.   Torrential rains Aug. 4-5 left 1.5 million to 2 million peoplehomeless as thousands of mud huts melted in the refugee camps thatring this desert city.   In Khartoum alone, 70 people died, 213 were injured and nearly115,000 houses were destroyed by the flooding, Egypt's state-ownedMiddle East News Agency quoted Amin Abdel-Latif, Sudan's ambassadorto Cairo, as saying Tuesday.   The agency said today that 18 Sudanese drowned when their ferryoverturned in fast currents on the Rahad River. The river is atributary of the Blue Nile, which joins the White Nile at Khartoumto form the Nile River.   In Omdurman, across the Nile from Khartoum, the agency saidthree children were killed and dozens injured when a housecollapsed because of the flood.   In northern Sudan, 99 islands were submerged and their 60,000inhabitants moved to safe locations, and 21 villages were washedaway and the 12,000 families who lived there were left homeless,Abdel-Latif said.   He said there were no figures on total casualties and damagesbecause the floods isolated so many places.   Sudanese Finance Minister Omar Nour Dayem earlier estimateddamages were around $200 million and that up to 2 million peoplewere homeless.   The crisis could worsen with the beginning of the Nile's annualflooding. Heavy rains in Ethiopia, source of the Blue Nile, haveproduced a plentiful flood after eight years of drought.   Officials don't know whether the Nile will flood the city, partsof which are already isolated by vast pools of stagnant water androads that have become impassable tracks of mud.   The Nile waters have already started seeping into houses alongits banks in the capital, and many residents have evacuated theirhomes for higher ground.   The Egyptian agency quoted Sudanese Irrigation Minister MahmoudBeshir Gamma as saying several areas in the north were threatenedwith river flooding. He said they included the large towns ofAtbara, Damer, Berber and Dongola.   Gamma also said floods caused by heavy rains in the westernprovince of Kordofan washed away many houses and left 15,000families homeless.   The Middle East News Agency said the large crop-rich island ofTuti, in the Nile between Khartoum and its twin city Om Durman, wasalmost submerged.   The agency quoted travelers coming from central Sudan and theGezira region as saying the annual flood submerged large areas ofland and left 55,000 people destitute.   Gezira contains the country's richest agricultural lands, whichare mostly planted with cotton, one of the Sudan's most importantexports. Losing the cotton crop would add to the country's economicwoes.   The World Health Organization in Khartoum has warned ofwater-borne epidemics that could kill thousands of peasants, mostlychildren, who are cut off from supplies of clean water.   About 90 planes have brought food, medicine, tents and othersupplies into Khartoum from all over the world, but Sudaneseauthorities have had difficulty distributing the aid.</TEXT></DOC>
