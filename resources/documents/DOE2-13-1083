Twenty thousand dry seeds of the three cultivars were irradiatedwith 20 krad of gamma rays and sown to obtain the M/sub 1/ plants. Irradiationreduced the number of seedlings that emerged and surviving plants. Inaddition, apparently normal and abnormal phenotypes were observed. TheM/sub 2/ plants were subjected to an artificial epiphytotic with twoleaf spot fungi, i.e. Drechslera australiensis and Alternaria alternata.Reactions of the M/sub 2/ generation suggested that the induced resistancesto both fungi were of a polygenic nature. In the M/sub 3/ generation,30 and 25 mutants originated from 16 and 18 families of the three cultivarswere found to be breeding true for resistance to D. australiensis andA. alternata, respectively. Other mutations were also recorded. (author).9 refs, 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
