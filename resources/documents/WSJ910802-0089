He used to have amanagement job in a South Korean construction company, butnow he owns his own enterprise in the U.S. -- sellinggroceries.   Mr. Jung, who migrated from South Korea to the U.S. in1982, is one reason Asian-Americans are creating companies ata faster rate than any other minority group. According to anew Census Bureau report, businesses owned by Asians andPacific Islanders nearly doubled between 1982 and 1987, agrowth rate twice that of black businesses and more than sixtimes that for the nation as a whole. Nearly all of theseenterprises are small businesses.</LP><TEXT>   As a result of this boom, a much higher proportion ofAsians is self-employed than of any other minority group.According to William O'Hare, director of population andpolicy research at the University of Louisville, roughly 6%of Asian-Americans own businesses of some kind, compared with1.5% of blacks, 2% of Hispanics and 1% of Native Americans.   The recession that began in 1990 probably brought declinesin minority business ownership, says Frank Fratoe, asociologist with the Commerce Department's Minority BusinessDevelopment Agency. But Mr. Fratoe says he doubts that theeconomic downturn has affected the rate of business creationamong Asians relative to that of other minority groups.&quot;Asians have been doing well in terms of founding businessesfor a considerable length of time,&quot; he says.   The level of Asian-American entrepreneurship reflects to agreat extent the efforts of recent immigrants from India andespecially South Korea, which Mr. Jung left because he wantedto live in a big, &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; country. &quot;Korea is too smalla country,&quot; he says.   Mr. Jung, who owns the Virginia Market, a grocery in agentrifying row-house neighborhood near downtown Washington,isn't alone. Fully 10% of all Korean-Americans in the U.S.own their own businesses. The comparable figure for emigresfrom the Asian subcontinent, the second most entrepreneurialAsian group, is 7.6%.   Immigrants from India and Korea are the second and thirdfastest-growing Asian-American subgroups in the U.S.,according to the 1990 census, though in number they remainfar behind more established groups, such as those of Chineseand Japanese descent. Between 1980 and 1990, the number ofAsian Indians in the U.S. grew 126%, to 815,447, and Koreansgrew 125%, to 798,849. Because recent immigrants are amongthe hardest individuals to count, these figures probablyunderstate the real growth of these groups.   The fastest-growing Asian subgroup, Vietnamese, grew 135%,to 614,547. According to Mr. O'Hare's calculations, theproportion of Vietnamese who own their own businesses, at 5%,trails that of Koreans and Indians. But Vietnamese immigrantscould be catching up. The new census report found that thenumber of Vietnameseowned businesses more than quadrupledbetween 1982 and 1987.   Why do Asian-Americans have such success in creating newbusinesses? Partly, the answer is the sheer hardiness ofthose who come. &quot;It's a difficult step to come across thePacific Ocean,&quot; says Mr. O'Hare.   But a more telling reason might be described as &quot;downwardmobility.&quot; Asian-Americans include many educated migrantssuch as Mr. Jung who gave up white-collar jobs overseas tobecome self-employed shopkeepers in the U.S. According toTimothy Bates, director of the graduate program of urbanpolicy analysis at the New School for Social Research in NewYork, the majority of Asian-Americans who own their ownbusinesses are college graduates.   Among Asian-owned businesses, the greatest number of firmsare in business services, which include data processing andmanagement consulting firms. These tend to be owned byU.S.-born individuals rather than new immigrants. Food storesaccount for the greatest combined receipts -- $3.8 billion --for businesses owned by Asian-Americans and PacificIslanders. These are the kind of enterprises most oftenstarted up by immigrants like Mr. Jung.   Asian-American immigrants' advancement in the U.S. isoften blocked by language barriers and skepticism about thevalue of the degrees they earned abroad. As a result, saysMr. Bates, Asian-Americans have been unable to penetrate notonly corporate America but also many profitable retailbusinesses such as furniture stores.   Indian and Korean immigrants tend to have an especiallyhigh level of educational attainment. Why would a SouthKorean white-collar worker trade his comfortable office forthe hectic life of a U.S. grocer? &quot;There's downward statusmobility, that is true,&quot; says Ivan Light, professor ofsociology at the University of California at Los Angeles. Butwages are so low in South Korea, he says, that emigration tothe U.S. offers the promise of greater wealth -- even if itrequires taking a lower-status job.   Another draw for South Korean immigrants, says Mr. Light,is educational opportunity. Although elementary and highschools in the U.S. are arguably worse than those in SouthKorea, U.S. universities are generally considered superior --and much easier to get into. &quot;Second chances are hard to findin the South Korean education system,&quot; said Mr. Light.   Overall, the number of Hispanic businesses grew 81%between 1982 and 1987, according to the census report. That'snearly as fast as the rise for Asian-Americans, 89%, and issignificant considering that Hispanics are more numerous thanAsian-Americans. But the proportion of all Hispanics who ownbusinesses remains fairly low for all subgroups exceptCuban-Americans, 6.3% of whom own firms.   In time, experts predict, the descendants of Koreanimmigrants like Mr. Jung, who has two children, will be morelikely to seek employment than to take the risks ofentrepreneurship. In the meantime, Mr. Jung says, he stilldreams of &quot;a better life.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
