Such so-called tort suits, which allege injury fromnegligence or product defects, increased 7.6% -- the largestincrease in that category in four years -- despite efforts attort reform to limit liability from such suits. The figuresfor 1989, the most recent available, were compiled by theNational Center for State Courts in Williamsburg, Va.</LP><TEXT>   Traffic and ordinance violations accounted for more than67 million of the cases. Overall, the number of new filingsrose only slightly from 1988.   Nonetheless, said Brian J. Ostrom, the center'scourt-statistics project director, &quot;most states cannot keepup with flow of new cases.&quot; The study demonstrates that statecourts are the workhorse of the nation's courts: In 1989,only 337,000 cases were filed in federal court.   &quot;State courts are a crucial arena of legal action, butthey are not receiving their share of the resources. And withthe current level of funding they do get, we are asking ourcourts to do too much,&quot; says Mr. Ostrom.   Lawyers were reluctant to speculate on the reasons for theincrease in civil damage cases, noting that the statisticsseem to vary from year to year, making it difficult to spotcauses or trends.   But one lawyer who supports limits on damages in suchsuits said the increase in filings suggests that not enoughhas been done to combat the so-called litigation explosion.&quot;There have been some helpful fingers in the dike, but tortreform has still been spotty,&quot; said Victor Schwartz ofWashington, D.C.   Serious criminal cases shot up even faster than tort casesin 1989, according to the report. In state trial courts thathear felony cases, filings rose 13%, the largest year-to-yearchange since the center began the annual study in 1984. Thestudy estimated that if the current pace continues, thenumber of felony cases will more than double by the year2000.   Legal experts who study court trends say the increase infelony filings reflects the growing number of drug-relatedprosecutions, which are also overwhelming the federal courtsystem.   ---   WEBSTER andamp; SHEFFIELD drops summer program, reneges onfirst-year offers.   Over the weekend, the New York-based law firm sent lettersto students who had accepted posts as summer associates, aswell as to students who had accepted fulltime employmentoffers, telling them that the firm couldn't honor the offers.   &quot;We terminated the entire summer program,&quot; said DonaldElliott, co-managing partner at the 56-year-old law firm. &quot;Wesent letters to all in the first year.&quot;   One law-school placement director said about eight summerassociates and 10 first-year associates received lettersSaturday. Mr. Elliott declined to say how many letters weresent out.   Mr. Elliott also declined to say why the firm decided torescind the offers. But in December, 11 partners at the firm,which then had almost 100 lawyers, were forced to acceptnon-partner status or leave the firm in response to a budgetsqueeze. Since then, former Webster andamp; Sheffield partners,associates and legal headhunters have speculated that thefirm may be on the verge of cutting back operations ormerging with another firm. Mr. Elliott declined to comment onsuch speculation.   ---   BANKRUPTCY-LAW FILING doesn't shield company from city'scleanup suit.   When a company files for protection from creditors underChapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, most litigationagainst the company is automatically halted. But the federalappeals court in New York ruled that a government suit overviolations of environmental law is excluded from the stayunder an exemption for &quot;police and regulatory&quot; actions.   The case involved New York City and its efforts to force awaste-hauling company, Refinemet International Inc., to payfor cleanup costs at a city landfill. The decision isapparently the first by a federal appeals court to find thatlocal governments are included in that exemption when itcomes to environmental cases. An attorney for Refinemetcouldn't be reached for comment.   Christopher A. Amato, assistant corporation counsel forNew York in environmental law, said the decision will beimportant in the city's pursuit of future environmentalcases, because the defendants in such suits are often inbankruptcy-law proceedings.   The appeals-court decision clears the way for the city toseek damages against Refinemet in federal court in Manhattan.Payment of any damage award would later be sought in thebankruptcy-court proceeding.   Mr. Amato said the city estimates that total cleanup costswere $400 million for the landfills involved. In settlementswith other defendants in the case, the city has so farrecovered $30 million, he said.   ---   SECURITY PACIFIC isn't liable in sale of loans to otherbanks, a judge rules.   Eleven banks and trusts sued Security Pacific NationalBank for losses they incurred after they purchased pieces ofIntegrated Resources Inc. loans from Security Pacific. AfterIntegrated defaulted on some of its loans, the plaintiffsclaimed that Security Pacific should have warned them morefully of the risks. Integrated, a real estate and financialservices concern, has been operating under bankruptcy-courtprotection from creditors since February 1990. It has beentrying to form a plan of reorganization, but has neededseveral extensions of time and is under pressure from debtholders.   The plaintiffs said their loan participation constitutedpurchase of a security, and that Security Pacific thereforewas required to follow Securities and Exchange Commissiondisclosure requirements. Security Pacific is the main bankunit of Security Pacific Corp.   However, federal Judge Milton Pollack ruled in New Yorkthat loan participations cannot be considered securities.Judge Pollack said the purchasers were individually in aposition to watch and protect their investments.   He further noted that &quot;saddling&quot; such participations withSEC requirements would end the flexibility of commercialloans intended for working capital uses.   ---   POLICE BEATINGS spur marketing push by Pre-Paid LegalServices Inc.   The company offers a sort of insurance policy for legalbills, under which consumers pay a set amount each month forlegal advice and representation by law firms retained by thecompany.   The prepaid legal plans have caught the attention oflaw-enforcement officers in the wake of the videotaped andwidely broadcast beating of a motorist by Los Angeles policeofficers. The beating sparked investigations of the L.A.police department and a renewed awareness of law-enforcementofficers' potential legal liabilities.   &quot;A lot of those {law-enforcement} people have called us,&quot;said Harland Stonecipher, chief executive officer of Pre-PaidLegal Services, based in Ada, Okla. The company is nowtargeting law-enforcement groups as part of a broader effortto market its prepaid legal plans to groups rather thanindividuals, Mr. Stonecipher said.   &quot;What happened in Los Angeles, as unfortunate as it was,has attracted a lot of attention to our type of product,&quot; Mr.Stonecipher said. Law-enforcement officers, he said, have&quot;suddenly become aware that any time they go out to arrestsomeone, somebody may have a video camera.&quot;   ---   PAN AM fails to move crash cases from Florida to New York.   In federal court in New York, Judge Charles S. Haight Jr.ruled against Pan Am Corp.'s motion to transfer the casesrelated to the 1988 plane crash in Lockerbie, Scotland. PanAm, facing bankruptcy-court proceedings in Manhattan, hadargued that the transfer would avoid &quot;the proliferation ofexpenses harmful to a bankrupt corporation.&quot;   Such a move also might have given Pan Am the benefit ofcourt decisions in New York's federal appeals court that denyplaintiffs access to punitive damages in such internationalairline cases. Plaintiffs had filed the 54 suits in Florida,largely because the courts there hadn't expressly precludedpunitive damages.</TEXT></DOC>
