The decision will shape U.S. immigration policy inthousands of cases involving refugees from such regions asCentral America, where anti-government insurgences have beencommon.</LP><TEXT>   The case involved a Guatemalan man who said he fled hishomeland in 1987 after armed, masked guerrillas tried topressure him to join their rebellion. He added that he fearedhe would be killed if he were forced to return.   The refugee, Jairo Jonathan Elias Zacarias, was arrestedin the U.S. and deemed by immigration authorities to havefailed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of politicalpersecution. The federal appeals court in San Franciscoreversed that decision, ruling that a guerrilla group'sconscription efforts did constitute political persecution.The appeals court said that &quot;the person resisting forcedrecruitment is expressing a political opinion hostile to thepersecutor and . . . the persecutor's motive in carrying outthe kidnapping is political.&quot;   By a 6-3 vote, the Supreme Court reversed the appealscourt decision and cleared the way for Mr. Zacarias'sdeportation. In his opinion for the majority, Justice AntoninScalia dismissed the lower court's reasoning and said anattempt to coerce a person into performing military servicedoesn't necessarily equal political persecution.   Mr. Zacarias failed to demonstrate a political motive forresisting conscription, Justice Scalia wrote. Non-politicalreasons, such as fear of combat or a desire to remain withhis family, could have motivated the defendant, JusticeScalia asserted. He rejected as &quot;irrelevant&quot; the appealscourt's conclusion that the guerrillas' motive was political.The &quot;ordinary meaning of the words&quot; of the immigration lawdirect judicial attention to &quot;the victim's political opinion,not the persecutor's,&quot; Justice Scalia said.   In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Stevens assertedthat choosing to remain neutral is a &quot;political decision&quot; andthat the majority had read the immigration law in a &quot;narrow,grudging&quot; fashion. Justices Harry Blackmun and SandraO'Connor joined the dissent.   Justice Scalia has stirred controversy in legal circleswith his use of the &quot;ordinary meaning&quot; approach tointerpreting laws. Some people contend the approach is simplya means for limiting certain rights. (Immigration andNaturalization Service vs. Zacarias)   Separately, the high court struck down an Oklahoma lawrequiring that at least 10% of the coal burned by electricutilities in the state come from Oklahoma mines.   The 6-3 ruling favored Wyoming, which had sued Oklahoma,claiming the coal restriction unconstitutionally interferedwith interstate commerce. The justices agreed, saying thatthe law, in effect, excluded coal from other states and&quot;cannot be characterized as anything other than protectionistand discriminatory.&quot;   Wyoming, in a special type of suit that states may bringagainst each other directly in the Supreme Court, complainedthat it was harmed by the Oklahoma law. From 1981 to 1986,mines in Wyoming provided nearly all of the coal purchased byOklahoma utilities. Wyoming doesn't sell coal itself buttaxes those who extract it. The state said it had losthundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue because of theOklahoma law.   The high court's decision involved interpretation of theConstitution's commerce clause, which grants Congress powerto regulate interstate business. But the Supreme Court haslong inferred from the clause a ban against state obstructionof interstate commerce. This second, implicit meaning of theclause required invalidation of the Oklahoma law, JusticeByron White wrote in an opinion for the majority.   Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by ChiefJustice William Rehnquist and Justice Clarence Thomas.Justice Scalia scolded the majority for allowing Wyoming tobring a suit that he said should have been filed by coalcompanies in the state, if anyone. He said that it was thefirst time the justices had recognized a state's standing tobring this type of commerce clause action on the basis of atax revenue loss.   Justice Thomas separately wrote his first dissent, arguingthat even if Wyoming had standing, the Supreme Courtshouldn't have heard the dispute on other procedural grounds.(Wyoming vs. Oklahoma)</TEXT></DOC>
