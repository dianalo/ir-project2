WIELAARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucciand his European colleagues in NATO will discuss financialcontributions to the military alliance at a two-day meetingscheduled to begin Thursday.   The alliance's European defense ministers will gather today fora routine meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels.   U.S. congressional critics of NATO claim the European NATOnations don't pay enough for the common Western defense and havethreatened to withdraw some of the 320,000 American troops inEurope.   Such criticism has risen as constraints in the United Statesbudget get tighter.   The European allies counter that most of the air, land and seaforces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are European.   ``It's a question of convincing (the U.S. Congress) that whatthe Europeans do reflects a fair assumption ... of the commondefense burden,'' said a senior NATO official, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   He said NATO ministers will set up a panel to review thefinancial issue and hope to present a report by year's end.   Carlucci will attend the meeting on his way to join PresidentReagan at the Moscow summit.   The NATO defense chiefs also will approve goals for each of the16 members for 1989-1994, NATO officials said. The ministers wereexpected to adopt 26 long-term force goals, 23 of these dealingwith planning for arms systems to be operational by the late 1990s.   The ministers also will consider a multinational force to offsetCanada's decision to end the commitment of its Air-SeaTransportable brigade to reinforce northern Norway in times ofcrisis, the officials said.   Canada announced a year ago that it would end its commitment inorder to consolidate its forces in West Germany.   The NATO ministers were expected to ask Italy to take in 72 U.S.F-16 jetfighters that are to be removed from the U.S. air base atTorrejon near Madrid. Spain's government, under domestic politicalpressure, asked for their removal.   In Washington, Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV toldthe House Armed Services Committee he expects Italy will agree tobe host for the 401st Tactical Fighter Wing.</TEXT></DOC>
