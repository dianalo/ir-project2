Kelly: Crusty Dealmaker Leaves Beatrice</HEAD><BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The surprise announcement that Donald P. Kellywill leave the chairman's post at Beatrice Co. is no reason formanagers to breathe any easier at companies in need of turnarounds.   Kelly's personal war chest, garnered from sharp dealmaking,golden parachutes and willing lenders, virtually guarantees thathe'll resurface on the takeover scene before long, experts say.   For a man who orchestrated one of the biggest leveraged buyoutsin U.S. corporate history, Kelly, 66, is likely to keep doing whathe does best: turning deals.   ``It sounds to me as if Don ... (is) regrouping to try to dosomething new,'' said Ronald Morrow, a managing director at SmithBarney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. ``It's been widely speculated that Donwants to start'' a new dealmaking company.   Kelly's resignation from Beatrice, effective Oct. 1, wasannounced Tuesday.   Observers had been expecting Kelly to spin off part of Beatriceas a vehicle for acquisitions, particularly after last month'sannouncement that for the first time since the $6.2 billion buyoutthat took Beatrice private in 1986, the company was not for sale.   But Kelly may not need an operations base. ``Don's track recordwill carry with him wherever he goes,'' said John Bierbusse, ananalyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.   ``He is regarded as a very savvy individual,'' and companiesKelly may have targeted ``can be nervous about him,'' Bierbussesaid.   And who wouldn't be concerned about a man who once said he gets``more nervous about a 6-foot putt than a billion-dollar deal.''   Under Kelly's leadership, Beatrice sold off some $7 billion inassets _ from Tropicana juice and International Playtex units to aCoca-Cola bottler to Max Factor cosmetics.   But rumors have been circulating that Kelly has had a fallingout with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the aggressive New Yorkbuyout firm that backed his Beatrice deal. As Bierbusse sees it, aconflict may have arisen over whether to sell what remained ofBeatrice as a whole or in parts.   ``If I wanted to go it alone, I could probably raise a lot ofmoney without KKR,'' Kelly told Fortune magazine last month. ``ButI believe that Don Kelly always needs someone of equal or greaterpower than he.''   Short on modesty and high-brow education but long on instinct,Kelly was raised on Chicago's rough-and-tumble South Side, startingwork at a gas station when he was barely a teen-ager.   Kelly, a one-time Navy torpedoman, was known as a quick decisionmaker as he worked his way up the corporate ladder at Swift andamp; Co.While traveling the country as many as 50 weeks out of the year forSwift, Kelly built relationships with the rank-and-file overcountless beers and cups of coffee.   He knew he could ``get the benefit of 50 years' experience atSwift'' just by sitting in a tavern with an employee, he toldFortune.   By 1977, Kelly was raking in a six-figure salary as chiefexecutive of the food conglomerate Esmark Inc., the new name forSwift, which he skillfully pruned and pared. When Esmark wasacquired by Beatrice in 1984, Kelly was believed to have made asmuch as $20 million.   Two years later, Kelly won his own battle for Chicago-basedBeatrice. Backed by Kohlberg Kravis, Kelly took the company privatein a $6.2 billion deal made under the premise that the whole wasworth less than its parts.   Kelly then formed E-II Holdings Inc., a conglomerate made up ofBeatrice subsidiaries, with the intention that it would buy andsell other companies through leveraged transactions. But E-II wasacquired by American Brands Inc. for $2.7 billion earlier this yearafter E-II made a bid to take over that company.   Proceeds from the E-II sale were estimated to have put $50million in Kelly's pocket, in addition to a golden parachuteseverance agreement valued at about $2.5 million.   Kelly was unavailable to comment on his future plans. But as hetold Fortune, ``I can be very convincing and very hard to changewhen I get going on something. I get going like a freight train...''   Observers are certain of only one thing. As one put it, ``heain't gonna retire.''</TEXT></DOC>
