Government spokesman Kyaw Sann told journalists the deadlinewould not be extended but the government would ``make all efforts tolet the students know our intention to receive them back withoutmalice.''   By Thursday, he said, 525 people had returned to their homesafter passing through 27 centers opened the government opened Oct.14.   They fled after a Sept. 18 military coup and brutal suppressionof a popular uprising against 26 years of authoritarian militaryrule. Most went to areas controlled by various ethnic rebel groupsalso fighting the Rangoon government.   Rebel spokesmen say more than 8,000 students, professionals,Buddhist monks and others sought refuge. About 5,200 of them are atbases of the Karen National Union, which has provided some militarytraining, the spokesmen say.   The government announced it would take no action against any ofthose returning who had not committed specific criminal offenses.   Karen sources on the Thai-Burma border cited unconfirmed reports,however, that some people had been mistreated at the receptioncenters. They said the alleged mistreatment includes forcing peopleto run in circles until they drop from exhaustion and severelyrestricting food and water.   Kyaw Sann, the government spokesman, said 21 insurgents and 15soldiers were killed in 37 clashes Oct. 22-27. He said theskirmishes did not include those with the Karen National Union,which is based along the Moei River between Thailand and Burma.</TEXT></DOC>
