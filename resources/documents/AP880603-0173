(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The City Commission did not intend tooffend the tobacco industry when it voted to approve a smoking banin city-owned buildings, a member who wants the policy rescindedsaid.   ``Although the restrictions were small, we wouldn't want them tomushroom,'' said Commissioner Jack Ross, who had originally votedfor the policy when it was approved last month.   The policy, which took effect Wednesday, bans smoking in themain lobby of city hall, city commission chambers, the city busstation and a handful of other public places.   It has drawn protest from the Pinkerton Tobacco Co., DaviessCounty's largest industrial employer, which contends the banreflects a poor attitude toward tobacco in the city. The companysaid it will reconsider its plans to expand the plant, whichemploys more than 500.   Mayor David Adkisson, who opposes a move to rescind the policy,said it will not harm the tobacco industry and that he had heard noone in town voicing opposition to it before it passed.   ``People will continue to make money from tobacco,'' he said.``When a police officer writes a speeding ticket, that doesn't meanthat local government is against the automobile industry.''   Owensboro, with a population of 55,000, is a major tobacco salescenter for western Kentucky burley. The Daviess County Farm Bureauestimates that area tobacco sales topped $25 million last year.   Pinkerton manufactures loose leaf and plug chewing tobaccos, andalso makes some smoking tobacco products.   Luther Pittman, executive vice president for operations atPinkerton, said in a letter to Adkisson that the company would``rethink'' its plans for the future in Daviess County. But he saidhis letter does not mean the company is planning to pull out of thecounty.   One wholesaler said it's not so much the policy that worrieshim, but the trend.   ``It's the kind of negative thinking that we shouldn't have inOwensboro, Daviess County or the Commonwealth of Kentucky, where somany dollars are derived from tobacco,'' said Truett Cook,president of Lyons Bro.
