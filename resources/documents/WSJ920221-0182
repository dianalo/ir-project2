Decatur Trotter, one of theFree State's senior black lawmakers, is trying to decide whoto support in the March 3 Democratic presidential primaryhere.   &quot;This young man Clinton, he seems to be good with themedia, has ideas about a vision of the country,&quot; Sen. Trottersays of Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. Then he sighs. &quot;But Idon't know.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   It is a problem that many black Democrats are grapplingwith right now. Black voters, though a mainstay constituencyof the national party, comprised only 1% of the electorate inthe New Hampshire primary, where Gov. Clinton finished secondto former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas. But as the pace ofthe primary season accelerates, black votes becomeimmediately critical to the course of the nominationstruggle.   In the March 3 contest here, black voters may make up aquarter of the electorate, and an even higher percentage inthe Georgia contest on the same day. In all but one of thefive Southern states holding primaries on &quot;Super Tuesday,&quot;March 10, at least one out of five voting-age adults isblack. Moreover, such big industrial Midwestern states asIllinois and Michigan -- both of which hold primaries March17 -- have smaller proportions but still sizable numbers ofblack voters.   The problem for many of these people is that they have nonatural home among the Democratic contenders. Mr. Tsongaspushes a pro-business message that has little resonance withmany black voters; for him, Maryland looms as a crucial testof whether he can transfer his appeal to an electorate fardistant, and far different, from his native New England, andespecially of whether he can attract minority votes.   Meanwhile, Sens. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Tom Harkin ofIowa both have had little experience in courting black votesin previous campaigns, while former Gov. Jerry Brown ofCalifornia -- who won the Maryland primary back in 1976 -- ishaving trouble being taken seriously. The one candidate whomight have excited black voters here, Gov. L. Douglas Wilderof neighboring Virginia, is long gone from the contest.   The result is that the beneficiary should be -- andprobably will be -- Gov. Clinton, who is used to courtingblack voters in his Arkansas campaigns and who has been themost assiduous of the Democratic presidential hopefuls inwooing them this year. But the nagging questions about hiselectability because of concerns over his character leavemany black leaders, like Sen. Trotter, uneasy.   Sen. Trotter, for example, remains undecided in partbecause of such issues. For the senator, a Korean Warveteran, the reports about how Mr. Clinton avoided beingdrafted reopen the issue of unfairness to the poor, theuneducated and minorities. &quot;It bothers me that rich boys gotto duck the draft where poor people, black people, couldn't,&quot;he says. He contrasts Mr. Clinton's actions with the &quot;valor&quot;displayed by Sen. Kerrey, a Medal of Honor winner.   But Sen. Trotter's concerns aren't universally shared;state Delegate Beatrice Tignor says she isn't bothered by theClinton draft issue, because &quot;black folks remember thatMartin Luther King was against the war.&quot;   In any event, the questions surrounding Mr. Clinton areall the more disconcerting because of the fact that blackleaders across the country are following a radicallydifferent course in presidential politics this year than theydid in 1988, when they, along with millions of black voters,overwhelmingly supported the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Back then,many black leaders were seeking a candidate who could carry amessage. This time, they are seeking one who can carry anelection.   &quot;The thing to me in politics is, we have to win,&quot; saysstate Sen. Gloria Lawlah, who has stuck with her earlysupport for Mr. Clinton despite his travails. &quot;If you don'twin, you can't change the system. I feel we in the DemocraticParty, we've had our chance to do something different and westill haven't won the voters back.&quot;   But the pragmatic approach offers risks. None of thesecandidates has the support of nationally known figures likecivil-rights leader Andrew Young, whose support buoyed thecampaign of Jimmy Carter in 1976. And in any event, at thisearly stage of the campaign the focus has been on enlistingdelegates to the party convention, not on buildinggrass-roots support. So it remains to be seen whether thejudgment of leaders will necessarily be followed by the massof black voters.   &quot;Big elections are won by the margin of enthusiasm,&quot; Mr.Jackson says in an interview. &quot;The burden is upon thecandidates to inspire support,&quot; he says, &quot;and the way toinspire support is to speak to real needs&quot; -- and not byrelying on the endorsement of black opinion leaders, evenhim.   Mr. Jackson, who ran in 1984 as well as 1988 but said hewouldn't run this time, realizes there's a big vacuum.&quot;There's pressure on me to get in,&quot; he says. And he plainlyresents speculation that the party might turn to others, suchas House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri orTennessee Sen. Albert Gore, if a deadlock develops. &quot;I beatGore {in 1988} in white states,&quot; he argues, adding, &quot;Doesanyone think Gephardt could beat me in California or Michiganor New York?&quot;   It's highly doubtful that Mr. Jackson would actually run,risking a third straight loss and giving up his recentlylaunched Cable News Network program. But if no candidatecommands a strong following among black voters, Mr. Jacksonmight well seek to play a large role in the deliberationsleading up to the Democratic convention -- a prospect thatprivately worries some other leading Democrats.   Meanwhile, here in Maryland, where Mr. Clinton has an edgeon endorsements from black party leaders, Tsongas campaignofficials are struggling to find some compelling argumentthey can use to convince black voters. &quot;No one is moreliberal on your individual rights -- your civil rights, yourgay rights, your pro-choice -- no one has as long or asconsistent a record as Paul Tsongas,&quot; contends Patrick Smith,the Tsongas chairman here. &quot;Paul Tsongas lived two years inEthiopia {while in the Peace Corps}. Color doesn't make anydifference to him. He's always communicated well with them,and worked well with them.&quot;   But analysts say Mr. Tsongas will have an uphill struggleto get that message across here -- not just because of Mr.Clinton's substantial money edge, but also because of theArkansan's shrewd efforts to mine the network of experiencedblack elected officials that has grown up here over the pastdecade. Maryland has 31 black state lawmakers -- the nation'ssecond-largest caucus of black state officials -- and morethan two dozen local elected leaders.   Mr. Clinton's Southern background, which once could havebeen a liability among blacks, has so far been a clear plus;black supporters see in him a candidate who has experience inforging multiracial coalitions. Because Mr. Clinton &quot;has beenaround blacks all of his life, there's a comfort levelthere,&quot; says state Delegate Howard Rawlings, who represents amajority-black district in Baltimore.   But it will take more than that, suggests Bert Lance, theformer adviser to President Carter. He says that despite Mr.Carter's early ties to Mr. Young and the Rev. Martin LutherKing Sr., he still had to cement his support through specificpolicy positions on such issues as affirmative action.   Mr. Carter's ability to do that proved crucial aftercomments he made regarding the &quot;ethnic purity&quot; ofneighborhoods touched off a storm of controversy. By then,Mr. Lance says, &quot;he had a reservoir of people who werewilling to stand up and defend him.&quot;   That is what no candidate -- including, for all hisendorsements, Mr. Clinton -- has at the moment. And whetherhe or anyone else can nurture those kinds of feelings amongblack voters may ultimately prove as important to the blackvoters as to the candidate.   &quot;This is a defining moment for African American voters,&quot;says Hulbert James, an aide to New York Mayor David Dinkinsand a key operative in Mr. Jackson's last two campaigns. &quot;Ina lot of ways it was easier to support Jackson; this timepeople are really going to have to say why they support acandidate. And people are going to have to decide what issuesreally are of concern.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
