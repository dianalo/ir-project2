The decision is a victory for railroads, which have long complained that their property is overtaxed by states.    ---   Gold prices rallied, bolstered by technical factors and a broader investor base. But silver futures continued to plunge in heavy trading, while platinum prices also weakened.    ---   An OTC stock exchange may open in Chicago May 18 if the experimental move wins SEC approval today.
