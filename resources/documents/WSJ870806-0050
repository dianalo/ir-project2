Brookes</HL><DD> 08/06/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO) </IN><TEXT>   Over two years (1985-86) of supposedly &quot;sluggish growth&quot; the U.S. economy created nearly five million payroll jobs, and formed 1.4 million businesses.    Yet according to the Commerce Department, America's average annual gross national product growth of 2.5% was not much better than the European Community's 2.3%, while the EC lost jobs and businesses, and saw its unemployment rise to nearly 11%.    Anomalies like these have called into question the accuracy of the Commerce Department's economic accounting. Now, the critics' case has strengthened.    On July 24, the Commerce Department announced that the 1984 through 1986 GNP growth numbers were all revised substantially upward, to 6.8% from 6.4% for 1984, to 3% from 2.7% for 1985, and to 2.9% from 2.5% for 1986.    The U.S. economy had not been &quot;sluggish&quot; or flat. Instead, during the 1982-86 period it had actually been growing at an average annual real rate of 4.1%, only slightly less than the 4.3% rate of 1975-79 -- one of the most powerful expansions in U.S. history. Over the 1985-86 period it expanded at about a 3% annual rate, a strong pace.    This increase, in turn, will automatically show up in substantially higher productivity gains for the same period, particularly since the Labor Department has recently revised total payroll employment downward by about 0.7%, suggesting that 1984-86 productivity gains will be increased by as much as one percentage point per year or more.    And, because inflation has been slashed at the same time as tax rates have been cut, the 1982-86 period produced a much stronger rise in real disposable personal income.    That figure, too, was revised massively upward, by $56.5 billion in constant 1982 dollars over the three years, yielding for the entire 1982-86 period a jump of 17%, much faster than the 1975-79 recovery period, when it rose 14.5%    On a per-capita basis, the 1982-86 period produced 25%faster disposable-income growth than 1975-79. So much for the&quot;low-paying jobs&quot; myth. In fact, on July 30 the Census Bureauannounced the largest one-year rise in real median familyincome (4.2%) since 1972, the fourth straight annual rise.   Virtually all of the &quot;undercounting&quot; of GNP came in the area of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which were boosted by $63 billion. One of the largest components of that came in retail sales, raised by more than $20 billion.    For nearly three years, there has been a huge and growing discrepancy between the retail sales trends and numbers released every month by the 18 largest general merchandise chains and those issued by the Census Bureau every month that are used as part of the overall GNP and PCE numbers.    For example, on May 8, the top 18 retail chains in the U.S. reported their best growth month in at least two years, with total sales up a whopping 13.8% from the year-earlier April. A week later, the Commerce Department reported not only that April retail sales overall showed an anemic 0.1% rise from a month before, but that department and general merchandise stores posted a 0.6% decrease. It also said department and general merchandise stores in April posted only a 3.1% increase in sales from a year earlier -- nearly 80% below the rate reported by the chains that supposedly make up more than 80% of the volume for all such stores! Roughly the same gap showed up for May and again for June, as it has every month for three years now, even in the fully &quot;revised&quot; reports.    Furthermore, the Census Bureau is apparently badly undercounting the total. It said June general-merchandise retail sales totaled $12.93 billion, up 6.5% from a year earlier. Yet June sales reported by the 18 largest chains (again which constitute about 80% of the volume in this market) totaled $12.55 billion, or 97% of the Commerce figure, a 9.3% rise from a year earlier.    Over the past 36 months, in fact, the 18 chains' annual sales have risen an average of more than 9% a year, compared with less than 5% reported for this category by the Census Bureau. During that period the 18 chains' relative &quot;share&quot; of the total Census number has shot up to 97% from about 93%, even though there is no other evidence of that kind of market shift.    This suggests that the Commerce Department's sampling of the retail industry is probably understating total retail-sales volume by about $15 billion to $20 billion a year.    So, even though the Commerce Department raised its GNP retail sales inputs for 1984-86 by more than $20 billion, it may still be undercounting as much as an additional $25 billion to $40 billion for the same period, which could add to the GNP revisions in the future.    Sadly, there is nothing new in this problem. The retail-sales census has long been the butt of many jokes and criticisms by those who watch the national-income accounts. For example, in 1967 the late, great economist Arthur Okun, then on President Johnson's Council of Economic Advisers, fired off a memo to then Assistant Commerce Secretary William Shaw complaining that &quot;in 1966-67 the advance retail sales report has given us, on balance, zero positive net information about the movement of total retail sales.&quot;    Unfortunately, for the Commerce Department and for the country, the PCE undercount pales in comparison with the very likely but not yet corrected overstatement of the U.S. trade deficit, due mainly to undercounting U.S. exports of goods and services. On May 14, in fact, the Commerce Department was forced to concede that the Canadians are probably right in suggesting that the 1986 merchandise trade deficit with Canada was not $21 billion as it had reported but closer to $11 billion.    This &quot;correction,&quot; which will not show up in the trade data until the June report (out in the middle of this month), was forced on the Commerce Department when the Canadians noted that the U.S. had undercounted its exports to Canada by about 20%. Instead of exporting $50 billion, the U.S. actually shipped Canada more than $60 billion in goods.    As the May 14 Commerce Department release stated: &quot;This is due primarily to a non-filing of U.S. export documents with the U.S. Customs Service.&quot; If this undercount were extrapolated to all U.S. exports, it could mean an overcounting of the trade deficit by as much as $30 billion to $40 billion a year, and a full percentage point on the GNP growth rate!    Even so, this would not fully close the growing gap between world-wide imports and world-wide exports. These imports are now over $100 billion higher than world-wide exports, an anomaly that many experts think is explained in large measure not only by the U.S. undercounting of merchandise exports, but by what the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment argued last year was a U.S. failure to count as much as $20 billion to $40 billion a year in services exports (financial, consulting, construction).    Revising these figures would not only dramatically reduce the U.S. trade deficit and raise U.S. GNP numbers still higher -- it might also help to explain why in spite of supposedly being a $263 billion-plus &quot;net debtor nation,&quot; the U.S. received $22 billion more in income from foreign investments than it paid out last year to foreign &quot;creditors&quot; or investors in the U.S.    Unfortunately these very large understatements of the real strength of the U.S. economy have (one hopes inadvertently) served to promote the Commerce Department's own protectionist agenda in a nervous Congress -- and the department's still very tentative corrections are coming too late to stop the unnecessary damage the trade legislation will do to what is now turning out to be one very powerful U.S. economy.    ---   Mr. Brookes, an editorialist for the Detroit News, writes a syndicated column.    ---           Economic Growth Trends In Two Recoveries                                   1975-'79      1982-'86    Real GNP Growth    Total                            18.5%         17.3%    Per Year                          4.3%          4.1%    Real Disposal Income    Total                            14.5%         17.0%    Per Capita                        9.9%         12.6%    Per Year                          2.4%          3.0%   Source: Commerce Department</TEXT></DOC>
