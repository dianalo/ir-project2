(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A four-alarm chemical fire closed twobusy highways near San Jose and produced clouds of noxious smokethat injured at least three people before firefighters brought itunder control, authorities said.   A passing motorist was overcome by smoke and taken to a hospitalfor treatment, said San Jose Police Sgt. Jim Morin. A firefighterand a police officer also inhaled fumes and required treatment, hesaid.   The blaze was triggered by a small explosion at Altus Corp., abattery manufacturer, about 1 p.m., and about 200 employees wereevacuated, said Jack Meral, a company vice president.   He said clouds of smoke, which also forced the evacuation ofsome nearby small businesses, were produced by the burning of achemical called thionylchloride and hydrochloric acid.   ``Essentially, breathing the smoke might cause some repiratorydistress, burning in nasal passages, a cough, irritation of theeyes,'' said Johnna Anderson of the San Jose Poison Control Center.``It could cause problems for asthmatics or those with lung orheart problems.''   She said that those who might have suffered a severe exposure tothe fumes could find themselves coming down with pneumonia or otherviral or bacterial infections a few days or weeks later.   ``When that delicate lining of the nose or mouth is burned, thebody has no more protection (against infection),'' she said.   The blaze was controlled around 2:15 p.m., officials said.   The Highway Patrol said Interstate 880 and Highway 101 near SanJose were closed temporarily. A massive traffic jam ensued, withmotorists backed up for about 15 miles.   At San Jose International Airport a few miles away, landings andtakeoffs were only slightly affected, said spokeswoman Marily Mora.   Several thousand people visiting Great America Amusement Park,about six miles away, were not evacuated.</TEXT></DOC>
