Both conservatives and liberals who hold dear the ideals of rational discourse and honest scholarship will be passionate in their outrage, and that passion is likely to have lasting intellectual and political effects.&quot;    &quot;The special-interest groups will suffer for going too far. The left-wing lobbyists from the ACLU, Common Cause, People for the American Way, the NAACP -- all these frantic propagandists -- have greatly cheapened their credibility. . . . A soiled, little secret has finally fallen out of the closet: anti-intellectualism on the left.&quot; -- Journal editorials, October 1987.    It's a year ago this Sunday that the Senate defeated the Bork nomination. In the meantime, the political fallout has started to land squarely on the anti-Bork forces, most notably but far from solely on the American Civil Liberties Union.    George Bush went out of his way in last week's debate to repeat his support for Judge Bork. This apparently did him some good. The post-debate Wall Street Journal/NBC poll found that 45% thought Mr. Bush would do a better job picking Supreme Court justices vs. 34% for Michael Dukakis.    Mr. Bush, meanwhile, has attacked the ACLU and its most famous card-carrying member. Its leaders are chafing at having become a political issue, rightly suspecting that what they gain in membership they lose in credibility. They opposed Judge Bork as being outside the &quot;mainstream,&quot; though in the view of many, including us, he was the man most qualified in our lifetime to sit on the Supreme Court. They scarcely have a right to cry foul when Judge Bork's supporters appeal to voters for a judgment on where the mainstream lies.    Meanwhile, another Bork opponent, the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, is paying in an even more direct fashion. It wanted to become a charity entitled to tax deductions for charitable donors, a Section 501(c)(3). The IRS said no, because the tax laws say such charities may not participate in &quot;any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.&quot; The city bar rates judicial candidates for appointed and elected positions on the local, state and federal courts. At the oral argument, Judge Ellsworth Van Graafeiland repeatedly criticized the group's highly partisan report against Judge Bork.    In the decision last month, the three-judge panel for Second Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled against the bar group. &quot;A representation that a candidate is able and has proper character and temperament is simply a subjective expression of opinion,&quot; the court held. It is not some pure, educational and nonpartisan exercise worthy of subsidized donations. The logic of this decision could just as well apply to existing 501(c)(3) organizations such as the ACLU and Norman Lear's People for the American Way.    The American Bar Association itself, for that matter, also savaged Judge Bork, somehow finding him less than qualified for the job. The ABA general counsel told us that &quot;we do not anticipate&quot; any tax problems for the group because of the New York case &quot;because the decision relates primarily to evaluations of candidates for elective public office&quot; (and because the ABA doesn't think 501(c)(3) rules apply to its judicial advisory committee). That's true, but it's not at all clear that the court limited its ruling to ratings for judges seeking elected office. In any case, post-Bork it's clear to us that lobbying senators is part of a &quot;political campaign.&quot;    The ABA is already in court defending its advisory committee on judicial nominations. The Washington Legal Foundation won a court ruling in August that the ABA committee comes under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and so must operate in public. But Washington federal Judge Joyce Hens Green also said that it violated separation of powers for Congress to require a committee advising the President on his nominees to act in public, and the ABA committee can continue to act in secret. We applaud Judge Green's view of executive power, but wonder whether it will survive on appeal.    We suspect the ACLU already regrets its decision to fight the Bork nomination, seeing the wisdom of its earlier position of not indulging in judgeship fights. As for the New York lawyers, we're delighted that they will have to literally pay for their outrageous stand against Judge Bork. None of these groups, including the ABA, can maintain their posture as disinterested and nonideological after participating in a campaign built on distortions and outright lies about Judge Bork's views.    The most telling commentary on the Bork lynching, though, is Mr. Bush's success in garnering votes by running against precisely the mind-set the Bork foes represented. Indeed, the presidential election has become the referendum that never was on the Bork nomination. </TEXT></DOC>
