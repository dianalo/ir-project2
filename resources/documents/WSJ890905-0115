Last night, TV Guide launched a $10 million ad campaign -- a hefty sum by magazine standards. The 30-second commercials, featuring stars from various TV shows, will air over the next five weeks on the major networks, cable TV and local stations -- and on News Corp.'s own Fox Broadcasting network.    And instead of publishing one fall preview issue as in past years, TV Guide will have five preview issues covering various aspects of the launch of new shows. The efforts are &quot;an attempt to get excitement back into TV Guide,&quot; says Joseph Cece, president of the Radnor, Pa.-based magazine, which News Corp. acquired last year as part of its $3 billion purchase of Triangle Publications Co. &quot;We need a big message now.&quot;    TV Guide's moves come amidst criticism of News Corp. for sensationalizing the magazine and blatantly using it to promote shows produced by its own Fox network.    TV Guide last week published a cover illustration of Oprah Winfrey's head on Ann-Margret's body, which TV Guide editors later apologized for. A recent cover story, &quot;In Defense of Tabloid TV,&quot; carried a photo of Maury Povich, anchor of Fox's own tabloid TV entry, &quot;A Current Affair.&quot; TV Guide also put Fox's &quot;Married . . . With Children&quot; show on its cover.    &quot;The quality of the magazine and its covers has deteriorated noticeably,&quot; said Cable Neuhaus, editor of TV Entertainment, a monthly TV-cable magazine. &quot;It's clear Murdoch will use the magazine as he likes. They are feeling pretty severe pressure to get their circulation back up so they are reaching for the lowest common denominator.&quot;    Mr. Cece says that the magazine &quot;has been under a microscope&quot; since News Corp. acquired it, but he denies the weekly is being used to push Fox, and bristles at the criticism that TV Guide covers have become sensationalistic under the Murdoch regime just to push newsstand sales. He points out that the tabloid TV cover was written by Van Gordon Sauter, former president of CBS News. &quot;You put your strongest story on the cover and we put things there to sell the magazine,&quot; Mr. Cece says.    Although TV Guide remains the country's most widely read weekly magazine, for the first six months of 1989, its circulation totaled 16.3 million, a 3.5% decrease from the prior year. News Corp. attributes that partly to an increase in the cover price last year to 75 cents from 60 cents.    Advertising pages are in a slump too. For the first half of the year, ad pages totaled 1,607, a 7.6% drop from last year, partly, the company says, because it abandoned the practice of trading ad space to local stations in exchange for commercial airtime.    Fall is usually a lucrative season for the magazine because of a blitz of network advertising in TV Guide directed at attracting new viewers. Last year, however, TV Guide was hurt by the TV writers' strike, which delayed the network's fall promotions. The networks traditionally promote the shows heavily in TV Guide and daily newspapers. &quot;Last year our pages suffered because the networks didn't have any new shows to push,&quot; says Mr. Cece. &quot;The fall season usually puts us on a circulation high for the year, but we didn't see that last fall.&quot; He expects the fall preview issues to contribute to an improved performance this year.    Despite its efforts to increase circulation and advertising, industry experts note TV Guide continues to face a changed market for its magazine. Charles Elbaum, a New York-based magazine consultant, points out that there are more TV and cable guides being distributed by the owners of cable systems, as well as more sophisticated TV logs in daily newspapers.    &quot;TV Guide also faces a shrinking consumer circulation market,&quot; says Mr. Elbaum. &quot;Households appear to have reached the saturation point in the number of magazines they are going to subscribe to, especially when they could get the cable magazine free or find what they need in the newspaper listings.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
