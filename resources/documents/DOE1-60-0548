The plates were composed of silicate glasses containing: (1)5.4 weight % of Tb/sub 2/O/sub 3/ in cladded-glass fibers in a matrixof 15 {mu}m spacing; and (2) 0.6 mole % of Ce/sub 2/O/sub 3/ in cladded-glassfibers in matrices of 10 {mu}m and 25 {mu}m spacing. The plates wereviewed with a three-stage image intensifier. Particle tracks and nuclearinteractions were recorded on film. The authors observed 5 detected hits/mmfor minimum ionizing particles in the Tb glass, and -- 2 hits/mm forCe glass. Preliminary measurements of attenuation length and radiationresistance properties of the Cerium glass which are of particular importancefor collider applications, indicate that {lambda}/sub atten/ andgt; 10 cmfor 10 {mu}m diameter fibers and that dose rates in excess of 10/sup7/ rads over a period of several days lead to a 20% loss of optical transmissionnear peak fluorescence (390 nm). The results of all these tests indicatethat scintillating glass fiber-optic plates can be used in high spatialresolution tracking detectors for both fixed target and colliding beamexperiments, and (in the case of Ce/sub 2/O/sub 3/ glass) high luminosityenvironments.</TEXT></DOC>
