WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Reagans dined on champagne and caviar in thecitadel of communism. The Gorbachevs set aside their campaignagainst drinking to serve the best of Russian wines. The eveningsun poured through floor-to-ceiling windows.   All glittered when the Gorbachevs played host to the visitingAmerican president and his wife in the icon-lavished splendor ofthe Kremlin's Hall of Facets, then led them on a tour toured thefortress's private rooms where they could have stayed as guests ifthey had wished.   The Gorbachevs' state dinner Monday night under the vaulted,frescoed ceilings of the opulent chamber drew the entire CommunistParty hierarchy and a select group of Moscow intellectuals,scientists, a cosmonaut and Russian Orthodox clergy.   Soviet leader Mikhail S. and President Reagan lifted theircrystal glasses of Georgian wine to toast their success innarrowing the gap between the superpowers and to wish for futuretriumphs in learning to deal with and respect each other.   The elegant dining hall was awash in light, from the windowsletting in the late spring evening sunshine and the fullyilluminated chandeliers that adorn the hall.   Silver candlesticks raising tall white tapers and sprays of pinkroses decorated tables spread with salmon pink linen.   The Kremlin pomp was more subtle than December's White Housestate dinner for the visiting Gorbachevs, where the women woreformal-length gowns and the American men sported black-tie attire.   At that occasion, Gorbachev and his advisers showed up inbusiness suits, causing eyebrows to lift in social circles.   On the occasion of the Reagans' visit, the hosts set aside theiranti-alcohol inclinations to treat their guests to domestic wines,champagne and cognac from the southern republics of Georgia andArmenia, to go with a dinner that began with caviar, turkey filletsand puff pastry and progressed through soups and courses of vealand perch.   The president gave Gorbachev a video cassette of an Americanfilm, ``Friendly Persuasion,'' regaling the mostly Soviet gatheringwith a lengthy description of the Civil War story but promising notto ``spoil its outcome.''   Fourteen Americans were invited to the state dinner, includingSecretary of State George Shultz, U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock andReagan's senior advisers.   Among the Soviet guests were all members of the ruling Politburoexcept Vladimir Shcherbitsky, who is based in the Ukrainian capitalof Kiev. The guests included space scientist Roald Sagdeyev,filmmaker Elem Klimov, former cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova and ahost of party officials.   Mrs. Gorbachev, in a sequined blouse and black skirt, listenedattentively at Reagan's side while her husband told his gueststheir two nations had made history with the accord ridding theworld of an entire class of weapons.   ``Now we have an unprecedented treaty. And our countries willhave to perform for the first time an overture of nucleardisarmament,'' the Soviet leader said. ``The performance should befaultless.''   Gorbachev also pointed to the U.S. and Soviet role as guarantorsof the Afghan accords signed in Geneva on April 14, noting theircooperation is of ``immense significance'' for their future.   ``The entire world is watching how we both will act in thissituation,'' Gorbachev said.   In his response, Reagan focused on the accomplishments he andGorbachev have been able to achieve in their four meetings since1985.   ``These are good first steps, Mr. General Secretary, and we canboth take pride in them,'' Reagan said, as the first lady, in a redprint dress and heavy gold necklace, listened from Gorbachev'srose-strewn table.   The Reagans stayed at the Kremlin for more than an hour afterthe dinner for a tour by their hosts of the Grand Kremlin Palace'sprivate rooms, where former President Richard M. Nixon stayedduring his 1972 and 1974 summits here.   ``They were quite lovely and the entire palace was really quitemagnificent,'' Mrs. Reagan said, according to her press secretary,Elaine Crispen.   U.S. industrialist Armand Hammer, whose ties with the Sovietsreach back to the days of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin'sleadership, described the state dinner as ``a very warm and happyoccasion.''</TEXT></DOC>
