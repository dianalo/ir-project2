McCANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Energy futures prices climbed Wednesday on the New YorkMercantile Exchange, reflecting increased confidence that the OPECnations will agree on production quotas for later this year.   On other markets, grain and soybean prices drifted lower,precious metals finished mixed, and livestock and pork pricesplunged.   There had been speculation in the energy market that theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would be unable toagree at its June meeting on production quotas for the second halfof the year. There is greater confidence now, reflected in prices,that an agreement will be reached, said Robert Baker, an energyanalyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 44 cents to 62 centshigher with the contract for delivery in July at $19.66 a barrel;heating oil was 1.75 cents to 2.11 cents higher with June at 49.61cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.13 cents to 2.59 centshigher with June at 66.83 cents a gallon.   Baker said the sharp rise in energy prices also can beattributed to a report from the American Petroleum Institute thattotal oil stocks in the United States are down 9 million to 10million barrels.   Traders also reacted to reports that Norwegian helicopter pilotsservicing Norway's North Sea oil platforms could go on strike. Aprolonged strike would cut deeply into Norway's 1.5 million barreldaily North Sea oil production, Baker said.   Grain and soybean futures drifted lower on the Chicago Board ofTrade as rain continued to fall in growing areas.   ``The price of the new crop corn and soybeans were reflectingenhanced soil moisture,'' said Ted Mao, an analyst for ShearsonLehman Hutton Inc. in New York.   Soybean futures suffered as some private forecasts suggestedthat the National Weather Service 6- to 10-day outlook willindicate above-normal rain in crop areas.   Wheat prices were up with news from exporters that Egypt boughtabout 300,000 metric tons of U.S. soft red winter and soft whitewheat.   Corn prices were down, but up from the day's low because oftechnical support and spillover from a rally in soybean futures.   Wheat settled 2{ cents lower to 3} cents higher with July at$3.98} a bushel; corn was 3 cents to 5} cents lower with July at$2.62; oats were 1{ cents to 2 cents lower with July at $1.73{ abushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 7{ cents lower with July at $6.97\a bushel.   Precious metals prices were up a fraction in fairly quiettrading on New York's Commodity Exchange.   ``The precious metals market is still concerned about thestrength of the dollar,'' said Fred Demler, a metals analyst withDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.   ``The market is oversold, but the feeling is prices willcontinue on the down side,'' Demler said.   Gold settled 20 cents to 60 cents higher with June at $364.70;silver was unchanged with June at $5.181.   Copper, which has given up nine cents this week, was down againWednesday .50 cent to .70 cent with May at $1.08 a pound.   Increases in exchange inventories, high world-wide productionand low industrial consumption is pushing down copper prices,Demler said.   Livestock futures were sharply lower on the Chicago MercantileExchange.   The drop in the cattle market was caused by stop-loss sellingand computer fund liquidation, said Paul Hare an analyst withLinnco Futures Inc. in Chicago.   The drop was assisted by a weak cash market outlook.   Pork futures reacted negatively to heavy movement of belliesinto storage and heavy hog marketings this week.   Live cattle settled .10 cent to 1.10 cents lower with June at69.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .65 cent lowerwith May at 76.72 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to .62 centlower with June at 48.45 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were1.17 cents to 1.70 cents lower with July at 33.10 cents a pound.</TEXT></DOC>
