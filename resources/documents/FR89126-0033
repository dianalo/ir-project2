Both section 310 of CERCLA and section 326 of Title III of SARArequire the persons intending to file an action to provide notice 60 daysprior to filing the action in the manner specified by regulation. The regulationsproposed today prescribe the manner in which the notice is to be provided.Today EPA is publishing two separate proposed rules. One rule prescribesthe manner in which notice is to be provided for citizen suits under CERCLA:the other rule prescribes the manner in which notice is to be providedfor citizen suits under Title III of SARA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Statutory Requirements </ITAG><T3>CERCLA: </T3>Section 310 of CERCLA authorizes any person to commencea civil action on his or her own behalf against: (1) Any person (includingthe United States or other governing agency) who is alleged to be in violationof any standard, regulation, condition, requirement, or order which hasbecome effective under CERCLA (including any provision of an agreementunder section 120, relating to Federal facilities); or (2) the Presidentor other officer of the United States (including the Administrator of EPAor the Administrator of the Agency on Toxic Substances and Disease Registry)for an alleged failure to perform any act or duty which is not discretionaryunder CERCLA. For actions against a violator of CERCLA, the plaintiff mustprovide notice to the United States, the State, and the violator 60 daysprior to commencing such action. For actions against an officer of theUnited States for failing to perform a nondiscretionary duty, the plaintiffmust provide notice to the United States 60 days prior to commencing suchaction. Section 310(d) and section 310(e) of CERCLA authorize the Presidentto promulgate these regulations; the President has delegated that authorityto the Administrator of EPA. <T3>See </T3>section 6(d) of Executive Order 12580 of January 23, 1987,52 FR 2923 (Jan. 29, 1987). Section 113(1) of CERCLA provides that in any action filed under CERCLAin a United States court, including actions under section 310, the plaintiff(if not the United States) must provide a copy of the complaint to theAttorney General of the United States and to the Administrator of EPA.<T3>Title III of SARA: </T3>Section 326(a)(1) of Title III of SARA authorizesany person to commence a civil action on his or her own behalf for specifiedviolations of Title III of SARA against the following persons:(1) An owner or operator of a facility for failing to: (A) Submit a followupemergency notice under section 304(c), (B) submit a material safety datasheet or a list under section 311(a), (C) complete and submit an inventoryform under section 312(a) containing tier I information as described insection 312(d)(1), or (D) complete and submit a toxic chemical releaseform under section 313(a) (section 326(a)(1)(A));(2) The Administrator of EPA for failing to (A) publish inventory formsunder section 312(g), (B) respond to a petition to add or delete a chemicalunder section 313(e)(1) within 180 days after receipt of the petition,(C) publish a toxic chemical release form under section 313(g), (D) establisha computer data base in accordance with section 313(j), (E) promulgatetrade secret regulations under section 322(c), or (F) render a decisionin response to a petition under section 322(d) within 9 months after receiptof the petition (section 326(a)(1)(B)); or(3) The Administrator of EPA, a state governor, or a state emergency responsecommission for failing to provide a mechanism for public availability ofinformation in accordance with section 324(a) (section 326(a)(1)(C)).For those citizens actions under section 326(a)(1)(A) of Title III of SARAagainst an owner or operator of a facility, the plaintiff must providenotice to the Administrator of EPA, the state in which the alleged violationoccurs, and the alleged violator 60 days prior to commencing the action.For those citizen actions under sections 326(a)(1)(B) and 326(a)(1)(C)against the Administrator of EPA, the state governor, or the state emergencyresponse commission, the plaintiff must provide notice to the Administratorof EPA, the state governor, or the state emergency response commission(as the case may be) 60 days prior to commencing the action. Section 326(d)of Title III of SARA authorizes the Administrator of EPA to promulgatethese regulations prescribing the manner in which notice shall be givenunder section 326(a).Section 326(a)(1)(D) also provides for actions by any person against astate governor or a state emergency response commission for failure torespond to a request for tier II information under section 312(e)(3) within120 days after the date of receipt of the request. In addition, section326(a)(2) authorizes state or local governments to commence certain actions:(1) Any state or local government may commence an action against an owneror operator of a facility for failing to (A) provide notification to theemergency response commission in the state under section 302(c), (B) submita material safety data sheet or a list under section 311(a), (C) make availableinformation requested under section 311(c), or (D) prepare and submit aninventory form under section 312(a) containing tier I information;(2) Any state emergency response commission or local emergency planningcommittee may commence an action against an owner or operator of a facilityfor failing to provide information under section 303(d) or for failingto submit tier II information under section 312(e)(1); or (3) Any state may commence an action against the Administrator of EPA forfailing to provide information to the State under section 322(g).Plaintiffs in actions under sections 326(a)(1)(D) and 326(b)(2) are notrequired to provide notice of such actions to the United States. Neitherof the rules proposed today apply to actions commenced under sections 326(a)(1)(D)or 326(a)(2).<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rules</ITAG>These proposed rules prescribe the manner in which the notice is to beprovided for civil actions under section 310 of CERCLA and section 326of Title III of SARA. The rules describe the manner in which the noticeis to be served, the contents of the notice, and the timing of the notice.Section 310 of CERCLA provides that notice is to be provided to the President,as well as the state and the alleged violator. The President has delegatedmost authority under CERCLA to several agencies, primarily to the Administratorof EPA (who has delegated some authority to the Regional Administrators).<T3>See </T3>Executive Order 12580 of January 23, 1987, 52 FR 2923 (Jan.29, 1987). Therefore, EPA proposes in the rule that notice be providedto the head of the agency with delegated authority over the provision ofCERCLA violated instead of to the President. The notice must be providedto the Administrator and appropriate Regional Administrator of EPA if EPAhas authority over the provision of CERCLA violated. If another agencyhas authority concerning the provision violated, the notice must be providedto the head of that agency.Section 326 of Title III of SARA provides that notice is to be providedto the Administrator, as well as the state and the alleged violator. EPAproposes in the rule that notice be provided to the Administrator and appropriateRegional Administrator of EPA (or to other appropriate agency officer)because the Administrator has delegated some authority under Title IIIto the Regional Administrators. For purposes of Title III of SARA, EPArecognizes Indian tribes to have the same status as state governors andin some locations, the Indian tribe may be a member of the local emergencyplanning committees. Therefore, if the violation involves an Indian tribeon an Indian reservation, the rule provides that notice should be providedto the Chief Executive Officer of the Indian tribe, or other appropriatetribal official recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Departmentof the Interior. EPA proposes in both rules that the notice include informationabout the proposed action so that EPA will have a basis to determine whetherintervention or other action by the United States, as authorized by Section310 and Section 326, is appropriate based on the matters at issue and considerationsof optimal use of Agency resources. For convenience, the rules providea list of addresses that will be frequently used in providing notice ofcitizen suits.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 through 612, wheneveran agency is required to publish a general notice of rulemaking for anyproposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment,a regulatory flexibility analysis which describes the impact of the ruleon small entities (i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and smallgovernmental jurisdictions). The Administrator may certify, however, thatthe rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. In such circumstances, a regulatory flexibility analysisis not required. The overall economic impact of these rules on small entitiesis small because they are procedural rules only. Accordingly, I herebycertify that these regulations will not have a significant impact on asubstantial number of small entities. These regulations, therefore, donot require a regulatory flexibility analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291</ITAG>Under Executive Order 12291, the agency must judge whether a regulationis ``major'' and thus subject to the requirement to prepare a RegulatoryImpact Analysis. The notice published today is not major because the rulewill not result in an effect on the economy of $100 million or more, willnot result in increased costs or prices, will not have significant adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, and innovation,and will not significantly disrupt domestic or export markets. Therefore,the Agency has not prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis under the ExecutiveOrder.This regulation was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for review as required by Executive Order No. 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This proposed rule does not contain any information collection requirementssubject to OMB review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Parts 373 and 374</ITAG>Environmental protection, Extremely hazardous substances, Hazardous substances,Hazardous wastes, Intergovernmental relations, Notice requirements, Naturalresources, Superfund, Title III.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.
