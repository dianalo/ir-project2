Oil industry executives also announced that they have renewedthe $15,000-a-day contract for the Soviet vessel Vaidogubsky, astate-of-the-art oil skimmer that will be on standby near theentrance of Prince William Sound as a backup in case of spills.   The use of chemical oil thinners, or dispersants, drew immediatecriticism from the environmental group Greenpeace.   ``It creates more of a hazard than it's worth,'' said CindyLowry, a Greenpeace spokeswoman. ``Right now, it seems a prettyrisky thing to try. There are so many important pupping areas forharbor seals. This is not the right time to do it. I don't thinkthey are that controlled, either.''   Exxon, under the orders of Coast Guard Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins,is developing a plan to test the dispersants on Ingot Island beach,a heavily fouled area of Prince William Sound. Scientists hope tothin the taffylike crude enough to float it away in the current,then allow it to decompose naturally. In some areas, the oil hasthe consistency of asphalt.   Robbins said other land cleanup methods, including hot- andcold-water washing of the rocky shores, had proven futile. ``I'mnot hot on dispersants, but I think we've got to look at it,'' saidRobbins, the on-site commander of the oil cleanup.   Earlier testing of dispersants proved inconclusive shortly afterthe oil spill March 24, when the Exxon Valdez tanker slammed intoBligh Reef and poured about 10.9 million gallons of crude throughits ripped hull.   The National Transportation Safety Board has scheduled hearingsnext week in Anchorage to investigate the cause of the accident.The fired skipper of the tanker, Joseph Hazelwood, 42, ofHuntington, N.Y., faces trial June 20 in Valdez on charges thatinclude operating the vessel while intoxicated.   The 11,400-ton, 450-foot-long Vaidogubsky was involved in theoil cleanup under a monthlong contract with Exxon. But the ship'shigh-tech pumping and dredging equipment frequently jammed on thehardened crude, or ``mousse,'' formed by buffeting from winds andwaves, and Exxon did not renew the contract.   But Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the oil industry's jointlyowned company that manages the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, hired theship through the end of May as ``standby backup,'' said Alyeskaspokesman Tom Brennan. ``It will be assigned to the tanker waitingarea south of Valdez. When tankers can't come directly into portbecause of heavy traffic, they wait out there.''   He said the vessel ``would provide extra protection'' in case ofanother spill.   Exxon has proposed cleaning some 364 miles of shore insidePrince William Sound and southwest from Valdez along the Alaskacoast. The company, which has spent about $100 million on thecleanup to date, said it will have 5,000 beach cleanup workers inplace by midsummer.   Much of the oil that has reached land has been pounded into theshore by wave and tide action, Robbins said, and the buried crudedoes not dissipate.   ``The oil trapped in the subsurface is not weathering at all,''he said.   The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation said themethods used to clean the beaches to date ``are not efficient atremoving this oil which is trapped in the soil ... or trappedwithin the shoreline sediment. More effective methods need to beused.''   Legislation creating a state commission to investigate the ExxonValdez spill and to increase spill fines to up to $50 a gallon weresigned into law Friday by Gov. Steve Cowper. He also signed a billthat imposes stricter liability laws on companies responsible forol and hazardous material spills.   The ``spill bills'' were the first to become law since the ExxonValdez ran aground.   ``These new laws are a first step in making sure another ExxonValdez incident never happens,'' Cowper said in a news release.``They also send a signal to the oil industry that it's going tohave to improve its performance or face some serious consequences.''</TEXT></DOC>
