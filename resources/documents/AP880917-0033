Sweden's high taxes and welfare system and the non-socialistopposition's ability to govern were chief issues in a televisionand radio debate Friday that analysts said could tip the balance inSunday's election.   Ten percent of voters questioned this week said they were stillundecided.   Young Greens supporters demonstrated outside the televisionstudio hall because their party was excluded from the broadcastdebate. Swedish public television said it was open only toincumbent parties.   The Greens failed to clear the 4 percent minimum for legislativerepresentation in the two previous elections they contested, butthis summer's ecological disasters and general discontent amongyoung voters have boosted their chances for seats _ and perhaps arole in a coalition government.   The five parliamentary party leaders all stressed theenvironment in opening statements, but in the ensuing debateconcentrated on calls for more housing and improved retiree, healthand child-care benefits.   A poll by the Swedish Institute of Public Research, or SIPO,forecast that Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson's Social Democrats andthe small Communist Party would win a combined 46.2 percent of thevote.   The three non-socialist parties polled a total 44.6 percent inthe survey of 1,094 people taken from Monday through Thursday. Thebalance between the two blocs was taken by the Environment Party,or Greens, with 7.1 percent. The margin of error was about 2percent, said institute director Bert Levin.   Another poll of 1,500 people by the IMU institute forecast a49.2 percent total for the Social Democrats and Communists, enoughto make the governing bloc independent of the Greens.   A third poll by the SEMKA institute forecast a more evensituation outcome, with 45.6 percent for the socialist bloc and44.1 for the non-socialists. The Greens polled 6.9 percent.   Carlsson repeatedly questioned what he called the non-socialistopposition's lack of a joint platform, referring to internalquarrels that split their coalition governments in 1976-82.   ``Voters alas have not received an answer about thenon-socialist so-called government alternative,'' Carlsson said.``You may wake up Monday morning and have a policy you do not havea clue about.''   Conservative Party leader Carl Bildt said the Conservatives,Liberals and Center parties had ``presented their aims.''   In the only reference to foreign policy, Bildt called for aSwedish entry into the European Market, while Carlsson said Swedenshould cooperate with the EEC ``except on foreign and defensepolicy,'' citing Sweden's neutrality.   Also absent were references to the ``Carlsson affair,'' theSocial Democrats' attempt with the help of publisher turned privatedetective Ebbe Carlsson to investigate leads in the 1986assassination of former Prime Minister Olof Palme.   The private investigation, undertaken without the knowledge ofSwedish authorities, forced Minister of Justice Anna Greta Leijonto resign last June.   The socialist bloc won a majority of 50.1 percent in the 1985election to the 349-seat Riksdag, or parliament. Social Democraticleaders have said the party would stay in office as a minoritygovernment if it could.   Their ability to govern would be in doubt if the Communists failto pass the 4 percent barrier and drop out of the legislature. TheSIFO poll gave the Communists 4.2 percent, an edge that could bewiped out by the margin of error.   Both blocs have said they would not rely on the Greens to form agovernment.   The Social Democrats have governed Sweden for 50 of the last 56years with the support of smaller parties.   Normal voter turnout is about 90 percent of Sweden's 6.3 millioneligible voters.</TEXT></DOC>
