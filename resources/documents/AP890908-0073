The bill, which drivers said could destroy their business, wouldbar the popular carriages from midtown streets except betweenmidnight and 7 a.m. to protect the horses from heat and traffic,said its main sponsor, Councilman Robert Dryfoos.   ``When carriage horses were of yore 100 years ago, Manhattan wasan oasis. Now, midtown Manhattan is a jungle. I want to take themout of the asphalt jungle,'' Dryfoos said.   The bill, which now goes to Mayor Edward Koch, would ban horsecarriages entirely during rush hours. During non-rush-hour periodsbetween 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., the carriages would be restricted toCentral Park. From 7 p.m. to midnight, the carriages would beallowed on city streets except in the congested midtown area, andfrom midnight to 7 a.m., they would be allowed in midtown as well.   The bill also limits use of the horses to eight-hour shifts,gives them 15-minute rest breaks every two hours and forbids theirworking when the temperature is above 89 degrees or under 18 degrees.   It would require drivers to have more training and owners tocarry more liability insurance.   Opponents of the bill, mainly the 68 carriage owners and 120drivers, said they could not do business under the new restrictions.But the bill also contains a provision allowing the drivers toincrease fares.</TEXT></DOC>
