But pepper doesn't fool an electronic drug detector developed for the Customs Service by Thermedics Inc., Woburn, Mass.    The machines, expected to cost about $100,000 once in production next year, have a second edge over dogs: They don't get tired.    In experiments last year at Boston's Logan International Airport, the sniffer detected cocaine-tainted money and a heroin-soaked prayer shawl that might have been overlooked by customs inspectors. Thermedics has almost completed a speedier prototype that it expects to try out in an airport where drug smuggling is more common than in Boston.    Thermedics won't talk about the technology because it was developed while working on an explosives sniffer under a classified government contract. The State Department is now installing the explosives sniffers at various embassies.    David Fine, Thermedics vice president, explosive and drug programs, says the sniffer &quot;looks at the drug molecule itself.&quot; He says it can distinguish among different drugs. &quot;There's a lot of computer horsepower doing the work of a team of chemists,&quot; he adds.    In last year's experiments, the detector was sensitive enough to pick up two codeine capsules in a British visitor's suitcase last year. Luckily, the man had his prescription with him.    Silicon's Sway in Chips   Expected to Continue   THE SILICON CHIP has a lot of life left in it. Most computer chips will be made out of silicon for another 10 years, International Business Machines Corp. predicts. Patrick Toole, vice president and general manager of the computer giant's technology group, says even the 256-megabit memory chips that will come into use late in the 1990s can be made &quot;with the extension of existing technology,&quot; without changing materials.    Industry watchers have periodically predicted that silicon would soon be too slow for chips with very big memories. Many expect that computer makers eventually will switch to gallium arsenide, a semiconductor inherently faster than silicon, but also much more difficult to work with.    IBM was the world's first maker of one-megabit memory chips, now standard in all its computers, and was among the first to announce the ability to make a four-megabit chip. A four-megabit chip can store the equivalent of 400 typed, double-spaced pages in about the area of a thumbtack, IBM says.    Continuing use of silicon should hold down research and development costs for chip makers. But Mr. Toole says the 256-megabit chips will have to be etched with X-rays rather than the photolithography used today. &quot;We are going to be producing dimensions smaller than the wavelength of light,&quot; he says.    Military Weapon Guides   To Move to Computers   THE PENTAGON wants to computerize production of manuals and other documents that account for about 6% of the cost of complex weapons systems. It has decreed that starting next year, manuals must be produced on computerized publishing systems to simplify updating, revising and correcting.    David Henry Goodstein, president of Interconsult, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm, says, &quot;As much as 25% of military documents are out of date at any time.&quot; Keeping information in consistent electronic form will make revisions easier and do away with mistakes from retyping correct information, he says.    The order has set computer companies scrambling to develop products for what is likely to be a $2 billion market selling to defense contractors over the next five years. IBM, Xerox Corp., Eastman Kodak Co. and Digital Equipment Corp., as well as small companies like Xyvision Inc. in Wakefield, Mass., are all designing systems to meet the Pentagon requirements.    The systems should cut costs at defense contractors, which now charge the government some $300 every time they change a page. Lawrence Leibson, president of Xyvision, says the 600-person team at McDonnell Douglas Corp. that handles documentation for the F-15 and F-18 fighter planes alters 500,000 pages a year. In some operations, the team expects to cut turnaround time in half and reduce costs 40% by using Xyvision systems.    Should Optical Disks   Be Legal Evidence?    MAKERS of optical disks would like their products to have their day in court. Most optical disks -- the latest storage media for electronic information -- are designed to be unalterable. Marketers of the new technology think business might pick up if customers were sure they could use them as legal evidence, substituting for paper.    They have growing support. Robert Williams, a Chicago information-storage consultant who recently wrote a book on the subject, says existing laws on evidence that admit microfilm and computer-stored information cover optical disks as well. Texas recently certified optical disks as a legal means for storing land records and other documents in county clerk's offices. Internal Revenue Service lawyers told agency technologists to go ahead with a project to store some tax records on disks.    But many potential users still worry whether it is safe to burn paper originals. &quot;There isn't any court precedent,&quot; says Marilyn Courtot of the Association for Image and Information Management, a trade group. She notes that it would be difficult to make sure that a document hadn't been enhanced or altered while being retrieved from a disk. </TEXT></DOC>
