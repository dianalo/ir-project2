A study was intitiated downwind on adjacent native range incomparison to a control area which was 4 miles upwind. Soil parameters,plant fauna abundance and summer cattle production were monitored from1963 until 1981. The control and study areas were typical mixed prairiethin black soil, covered by natural climax medium-height grasses in thicksod areas, interspersed with areas of short grasses. Both sites havebeen used for summer grazing and/or wild hay production since the late1880s. Neither site has ever been cultivated. The soil pH values in bothcontrol and study areas prior to 1970 were in the range of 7.6 to 8.5.Subsequently, a few study sites closest to the sulphur pile showed significantdrops in pH (4.4 to 5.6). Analysis of soils revealed no significant differencesin available phosphorus nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, selenite, or theamount of organic matter between study and control samples. The vegetationin the control and study areas was generally similar at the start ofthe study in 1963. In 1971 and 1975, the weaning weights of calves pasturedon the study area were significantly lower than for calves weaned offcows from the control area. The cause could not be ascertained with certainty.5 refs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
