Cabletron, based in Rochester, N.H., will report profit ofabout $6 million, or 23 cents a share, on an increase inrevenue to about $30 million, Mr. Levine said. Year-earliernet was $3.9 million, or 16 cents a share, on revenue of$18.6 million.</LP><TEXT>   For the year, net is believed to have nearly doubled, to$22 million, or 87 cents a share, from $11.9 million, or 48cents a share, in fiscal 1989. Revenue is put at about $104million, up from $54.8 million.   Cabletron develops, manufactures and installs cabling,network-management software and data concentrators to connectpersonal computers and workstations. The market has beengrowing rapidly and is forecast to reach more than $750million within three years, according to consultant ForresterResearch Inc., Cambridge, Mass.   Cabletron, which went public last year at $15.50 a share,saw its stock fall as low as $7 before mounting a strongcomeback in recent months. Analysts questioned the company'srelatively young, unseasoned management team and Cabletron'sability to keep pace with changing technology.   In an interview, Mr. Levine, 32 years old, said he andco-founder and Chairman Craig Benson, 36, are working torecruit managers and had increased the engineering andsoftware development staff sharply. &quot;We know our limitations,and we are going to have to add some professional managers asthe company continues to grow,&quot; he said.   Mr. Levine, who directed the transformation of Cabletronfrom a low-tech cable installer to a network-equipment maker,added that the company hasn't marketed itself very well. Heplans to step up spending on marketing this year and hopes toexpand European operations, which now account for about 20%of total sales.   Cabletron has steadily increased its investments inproduct development and recently unveiled a line offiber-optic plug-in boards for Apple and IBM-compatiblepersonal computer networks. Mr. Levine said Case WesternReserve University has already installed a large, fiber-opticcomputer network using the devices, which range in price from$399 to $949 a card.   Cabletron's largest customer is Sun Microsystems Inc., thebig Mountain View, Calif., workstation maker. Sun accountedfor about 4% of Cabletron's revenue in fiscal 1989, Mr.Levine said. Other customers and resellers include AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph, Silicon Graphics and Unisys, he added.   Mary A. Modahl of Forrester Research said Cabletron is ina three-way tie for market share with SynOptics and TandemComputers' Ungermann-Bass unit. She says SynOptics, with 1989revenue of $77.3 million, probably has somewhat more marketmomentum than Cabletron.   &quot;Cabletron is in a very hot market, but few people on WallStreet have ever heard of them,&quot; she said. &quot;They've combineda no-nonsense cable-pulling business with some impressivetechnology.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
