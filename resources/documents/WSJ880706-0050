Completes the Sale Of E-II Holdings Inc. </HL><SO> </SO><CO> AMB </CO><IN> TNM </IN><DATELINE> OLD GREENWICH, Conn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   American Brands Inc. completed the sale of E-II Holdings Inc. to a New York company controlled by the investor Meshulam Riklis.    A unit of Riklis Family Corp., owned by Mr. Riklis and members of his family, paid about $950 million in cash plus $250 million face amount of preferred stock, and assumed $1.5 billion of E-II debt.    But the Riklis unit received $645 million paid by American Brands for five E-II businesses it retained, as well as an undisclosed sum for two other E-II units that American Brands now intends to sell.    American Brands, a tobacco concern with interests in consumer products and financial services, had paid $1.1 billion for all of E-II last February, in a so-called Pac Man defense to fend off a possible E-II takeover of American Brands. E-II, then based in Chicago where it had been spun off from Beatrice Cos., is a consumer-products concern.    Riklis Family Corp., based in New York, said it has transferred to E-II the stock of Faberge Inc., a New York apparel and toiletries concern. It said E-II valued the stock at $925 million.    In turn, E-II paid a $925 million dividend, which Riklis Family Corp. will use toward financing the E-II takeover.    Mr. Riklis said he has become chairman, president and chief executive officer of E-II. American Brands Chairman William J. Alley had been chairman of E-II. E-II's president and chief executive officer had been American Brands President Thomas C. Hays.    In federal court in Manhattan, a group of E-II bondholders, which had sued American Brands to block the E-II sale, was unable to obtain an injunction against the transaction. But the group still plans to press damage claims of at least $60 million, said James Nespole of the law firm Reavis andamp; McGrath, representing the plaintiffs. The investors say they have been hurt by the transfer of E-II to a less creditworthy concern. </TEXT></DOC>
