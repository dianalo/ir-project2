SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan demanded today that Congresskeep his ``Star Wars'' missile defense system alive, arguing thatcutting the high-tech program because of domestic budget pressureswould be ``irresponsible in the extreme.''   Reagan, kicking off an administration campaign keyed to theprogram's fifth anniversary, charged that congressional cuts in hisStrategic Defense Initiative have ``set the program back one to twoyears.''   Even though Reagan has reached the point in his presidency wherehe has sent his last budget to Congress, he pledged in an addressto the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis to see the programcontinued.   And he lauded the technological advances that have been made,asserting that the program has ``progressed more rapidly'' thanfirst thought possible.   ``We will continue to research SDI, to develop and test it, andas it becomes ready, we will deploy it,'' Reagan vowed.   The president restated his belief that without the space-basedmissile defense, the United States will be left defenseless in theface of an advanced Soviet space-weapons program.   ``A recent report by the Department of Defense called `TheSoviet space challege' warns that the Soviet space program pointsin one disturbing direction. ... the methodical pursuit of awar-fighting capability in space,'' Reagan charged.   Because Congress has made cuts for the past four years inadministration SDI requests, ``We would be dangerouslyundeprepared,'' Reagan asserted.   ``There's been a tendency by some in Congress to discuss SDI asif its funding could be determined purely by domesticconsiderations, unconnected to what the Soviets are doing,'' Reagansaid, ``That is, to put it plainly, irresponsible in the extreme.''   The president argued that ``some in the U.S. Congress'' havedenied additional funds ``because they say SDI won't work. Well, itwon't if we don't develop it and test it.''   ``Congress should realize that it is no longer a question ofwhether there will be a SDI program or not. The only question willbe whether the Soviets are the only ones who have strategicdefenses while the United States remains entirely defenseless,''Reagan said.   The pro-SDI campaign comes as Congress has placed constraints onSDI testing and expenditures, and as Soviet arms controlnegotiators in Geneva attempt to crimp the U.S. effort amidnegotiations on a U.S.-Soviet treaty to slash strategic nuclearweapon arsenals by half.   The president has rarely missed a chance to plug the U.S.effort. Even at a light-hearted commemorative ceremony last week tohonor Notre Dame's legendary football coach Knute Rockne, Reagan'sspeech contained a passage referring to the ``dark side'' of theworld's technological progress and arguing that his plan wouldsolve the nuclear dilemma.   He pointed to the millions of civilians and military killed inWorld Wars I and II, and said if a third worldwide conflagrationoccurs in the nuclear age, ``it's estimated that 90 percent of thecasualties will be civilian.''   The president said SDI would ``point the way out'' of thisproblem.   ``It's given us the promise of basing our security in the futureon protection rather than the threat of retaliation. SDI offers achance to reverse not only the nuclear arms build-up, but also toreverse the trend that in effect has put a lower and lower value onhuman life,'' Reagan said.   Opponents of the program argue that it will cost untold billionsand won't work, and that it will only encourage the Soviets toabandon arms control efforts and increase their offensive weaponsin order to best U.S. defensive systems.   In the last fiscal year, the administration sought $5.7 billionfor Star Wars, but Congress allowed only $3.6 billion.   Capitol Hill also banned the use of federal funds for any SDItests that would violate a strict interpretation of the 1972Antiballistic Missile Treaty. Pentagon officials including DefenseSecretary Frank Carlucci have said no such tests are planned forthe near future.   While the Soviet Union has argued that the ABM Treaty forbidsmuch research, testing and development of an SDI system, the Reaganadministration has insisted on a so-called ``broad'' interpretationof the treaty that would permit expanded SDI tests and development.   Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, at their Decembersummit, in essence agreed to disagree for a time on the issue,saying in a joint communique they would observe the ABM Treaty ``assigned in 1972, while conducting their research, development andtesting as required.''   U.S. and Soviet negotiators in Geneva have remained at odds overhow to address the issue.</TEXT></DOC>
