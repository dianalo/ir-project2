Mr. Lafontaine, once the darling of the West German left, is trying to sell himself as a centrist candidate of the opposition Social Democratic Party. The German people will probably have a chance to decide if they want him to run the country in 1990, when, if things go according to his plan, he emerges as the Social Democratic alternative to the Christian Democratic Chancellor Helmut Kohl.    When Mr. Lafontaine came to national political prominence in West Germany a decade ago, he was full of fiery talk. He wanted Germany to quit the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He wanted an immediate end to nuclear power.    Mr. Lafontaine is still Germany's most outspoken politician. But he hardly sounds like the same man: He talks about &quot;economic competence&quot; and jobs, not missiles and military alliances. And the object of his scorn isn't the right but former allies: workers, whom he now calls &quot;lazy,&quot; and unions, whom he chastises for refusing to consider weekend work. &quot;We have to find new ways to create new jobs,&quot; the new Mr. Lafontaine told fellow members of the Social Democratic Party at the party congress last week.    That Mr. Lafontaine now talks of the need for higher profits for business and fewer demands from labor reflects his propensity for riding the waves of public opinion. When the public turned to the left on military matters a few years ago, he led the charge. Now that it worries about West Germany's economic future, he is again trying to keep one step ahead.    The party probably won't decide until next year who will be its standard-bearer in 1990. But Mr. Lafontaine is already seen by some as the front-runner. An important test of his popularity came in the delegates' voting on the party leadership last week; he was re-elected vice chairman with a 69% majority; it would have been more but for strong labor opposition.    &quot;He is the coming man in the party,&quot; said one delegate, Dieter Schanz, following Mr. Lafontaine's speech. &quot;Who else do we have?&quot; Among the party's three top leaders, Mr. Lafontaine is the only untested chancellor candidate; Co-Chairman Johannes Rau and Chairman Hans-Jochen Vogel were defeated in the past two elections.    Mr. Vogel is enjoying a popularity boom right now, winning re-election to his post with a 98% majority, one of the highest margins ever. He is also credited with engineering the Social Democrats' recent surge in the polls ahead of the ruling Christian Democratic Union. Nevertheless, his previous defeat -- and his reputation as a boring speaker -- remain formidable obstacles to his candidacy.    Meantime, Mr. Lafontaine's criticism of union demands and civil-service workers' supposed laziness have soured his relations with labor. Franz Steinkuehler, head of the big IG Metall metalworkers union, said his suggestion of expanding weekend work could have &quot;catastrophic consequences&quot; for Germany.    Creating controversy is undoubtedly part of Mr. Lafontaine's strategy. He first gained the national spotlight during Germany's contentious debate over the deployment of U.S. missiles. The publicity he received as a leader against deployment rocketed him to an overwhelming election in 1985 as governor of the Saarland.    &quot;Sure, he's clever,&quot; said one delegate, Karlheinz Gerhards. &quot;But don't we need a clever leader?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
