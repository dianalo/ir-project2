 These large information objects are treatedlike other database fields, and are accessible through SQL.andP;  The engineitself is engineered to take advantage of multiprocessor computers.andP;  Alsofeatured is an optimizer that further enhances performance by determining themost efficient ways to handle complex queries.andM;Full or incremental on-line archiving provides high data availability.andO;System backups can occur while applications are running.andP;  Fault tolerance isaided by disk mirroring.andP;  Users can share data from OnLine databases onremote servers transparently when the software is used in conjunction withanother new product recently announced by the company, the Informix-Stardistributed database.andM;Informix, Menlo Park, CA.andP;  415-926-6300.andM;UTS to UNIXandM;Amdahl Corp. launched a new series of mainframe computers designed to meetthe computing and fileserving requirements of large UNIX-based networks.andP;  The7300 series of processors runs Amdahl's UTS Release 2.0 operating system, animplementation of System V Release 3.1.andP;  Primary markets for the new productline are government agencies and large organizations making use of UNIX-baseddepartmental systems.andM;Two processors comprise the series: the 7300-150 uniprocessor and the7300-250 dual processor.andP;  Both models feature bipolar VLSI chips.andP;  Combinedhigh-speed RAM and VLSI logic circuits are built to reduce chip-to-chipcommunications and speed up instruction-execution times.andP;  These ECL chips,used for general-purpose registers and local buffer storage, each contain1200 logic gates plus 16 kilobits of RAM.andP;  Local buffer storage totals 32 KBof RAM per CPU.andP;  Bipolar ECL RAM chips provide 256 KB of global buffer andcontrol storage.andP;  Integrated VLSI logic chips using CMOS technology are usedfor the I/O channels.andP;  One-megabit CMOS DRAM chips provide main memorystorage.andM;Each of three main functional units resides on a single 24-layer printedcircuit board.andP;  All main storage units have 16-way interleaving to increasethe speed of data moving between main storage and the CPU.andP;  Channel designallows an I/O operation to be started by the CPU and carried outindependently by the channel processor.andM;A variety of main storage and channel configurations are available.andP;  Sixteenchannels are standard on both models.andP;  Up to 32 channels can be configuredwith the following constraints: one must be a byte-multiplexer channel, andthe remaining 31 may be configured individually as either byte or blockmultiplexer channels.andM;Customers can select main storage amounts on the order of 32 to 256 MB forthe uniprocessor model and 64 to 256 MB for the dual processor version.andP;  Themachines will become available in January of this year.andP;  Prices begin at$730,000 for the 7300-150 uniprocessor and at $1,254,000 for the 7300-250dual processor.andM;Amdahl, Sunnyvale, CA.andP;
