Of course, this is the same presidentwho swore he would never raise taxes. So it's not toosurprising that the administration is now preparing to renewone of the more dreadful experiments in managed trade: theU.S.-Japan semiconductor agreement.   The semiconductor agreement, originally entered into in1986, is due to expire in July. Negotiators met this weekendin Tokyo to work out the final details of a five-yearextension.</LP><TEXT>   The agreement had its origins in the decline of part ofthe U.S. semiconductor industry -- general purpose,&quot;commodity&quot; memory chips. These devices enable computers tostore and retrieve data and software. During the first halfof the 1980s, U.S. producers of such chips steadily lostmarket share to Japanese competition. A severe industry slumpin 1985-86 worsened matters. In one type of chipparticularly, dynamic random access memory chips (DRAMs), theU.S. industry had been routed: U.S. merchant producers --chip makers who sell on the open market rather than consumetheir chips themselves -- clung to only 5% of the U.S. marketin 1986, from 100% a decade before.   U.S. chip makers responded to this crisis by running toWashington and crying foul. They accused the Japanese ofunfairly selling below cost (otherwise known as &quot;dumping&quot;),and of benefiting from government subsidies.   Neither charge holds water. Charging below average costsis a normal business practice for American as well as foreignchip makers. Indeed, the concept of &quot;forward pricing&quot; --selling below current average costs to boost volume and lowerfuture costs by moving down the &quot;learning curve&quot; --w aspioneered by Texas Instruments in the early 1970s.   As for subsidization, Japanese government support of thesemiconductor industry has been dwarfed by the Pentagon's Randamp;Doutlays. In both the U.S. and Japan, though, the greatbreakthroughs in microelectronics have been driven byentrepreneurial innovation, not industrial policy.   Japan's dominance of the market for commodity memory chipshas been due to two Japanese strengths, neither of which hasanything to do with &quot;unfair trade.&quot; First, the superiormanufacturing efficiency of Japanese producers gives themlower costs. Second, the major Japanese chip makers -- NEC,Toshiba, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Mitsubishi and Matsushita -- arealso major chip users, and thus are better insulated fromvolatility in the market.   Nevertheless, the ostensibly free-trade Reaganadministration succumbed to protectionist temptation, as ithad previously done with automobiles and steel. The U.S.prevailed upon Japan in July 1986 to enter an agreementsubjecting trade in semiconductors to unprecedented control.   Under the accord, quarterly price floors were establishedfor Japanese commodity memory chips sold to the U.S. Inaddition, the Japanese government agreed to monitor theexport prices of these and other semiconductor products notonly to the U.S. but also to third countries. In effect,Japan was to impose world-wide price controls. Finally, Japanpromised to improve access to its market for U.S. chipmakers. A &quot;side letter&quot; to the agreement stated that a 20%share of the Japanese market &quot;can be realized&quot; bynon-Japanese producers within five years and that theJapanese government &quot;welcomes its realization.&quot; The U.S. hasinterpreted this language as a binding guarantee of 20% ofthe Japanese market.   The agreement, designed to restore order to semiconductortrade, instead plunged it into chaos. The price floor systemraised chip prices in the U.S. The resulting drop-off inalready weak demand created a glut in Japan. This in turngave rise to a booming &quot;gray market.&quot; Chips were smuggled outof Japan and sold in the U.S. at 20% to 40% below the floorprice.   Smugglers known as &quot;suitcase brigades&quot; flew into the U.S.and throughout Asia, carrying luggage filled withsemiconductors right through airport customs (tens ofthousands can fit in a single suitcase). Meanwhile,oversupply and low prices in Japan impeded efforts ofAmerican producers to boost sales there.   By the spring of 1987, the agreement was on the verge ofcollapse. The Reagan administration chose to blame theJapanese, and retaliated with 100% duties on Japanesetelevisions, power tools and laptop computers. Japan'sgovernment, under pressure of the sanctions, tightened exportlicensing and imposed production controls on thesemiconductor industry.   Unfortunately, the move came just as the market forcommodity chips began to pick up again. With supplyrestricted and demand rising, prices tripled and quadrupled.The chip shortage got so bad that American chip producerscalled for Japan to take steps to lower prices to preventdemand for computers from collapsing. There's just nopleasing some people.   Since this embarrassing flip-flop, the dumping issue hasfaded from the headlines. Access to the Japanese market, bycontrast, still rankles U.S. producers. According to U.S.statistics, non-Japanese chip makers currently supply about13% of the Japanese market, up from 8% five years ago.Despite this progress, the U.S. industry points to itsroughly 50% market share in the &quot;neutral ground&quot; of Europe asevidence that there must be trade barriers in Japan.   But Japan imposes no tariffs or quantitative restrictionson foreign semiconductors. There isn't any explicit policythat the Japanese government could change to open the way forU.S. producers -- as opposed, for example, to the ban onAmerican rice. The biggest barrier facing American chipimports appears to be tough competition from the home team.Accordingly, the fair-sounding demand for open market accesstranslates into a demand that Japan's government pressure orforce private Japanese companies into changing their buyingpatterns. The reputation of &quot;made in the U.S.A.&quot; isn't likelyto be helped if American companies must rely on coercion toget customers.   What then has been the net effect of the semiconductoragreement? First, it ended up as a massive bailout ofJapanese chip makers. They had built up grossly excessivecapacity in the early 1980s, and were losing billions in the'85-'86 slump (far more than their U.S. competitors, by theway). The artificially high prices caused by the pact allowedJapanese makers to earn vast profits -- which they haveplowed into becoming even more competitive.   The agreement wasn't much help, however, to the U.S.commodity chip industry. American production of DRAMs for themerchant market remains as marginal today as it was in 1986.Meanwhile, American companies that were ahead of thecompetition in 1986 -- namely computer and software companies-- were injured by the memory chip shortage the accordcreated. While American computer makers had to delay theintroduction of new models because of lack of memory, theJapanese, who were not subjected to these artificialshortages and inflated prices, were able to play catch-up.And finally, as always happens, the American consumer wasstuck with the protectionist bill, this time through highercomputer prices.   Now the whole debacle is to be repeated. In fact, the newagreement may actually be worse than the original. It appearsthat Japan will agree to direct 20% of its semiconductormarket to foreign producers by the end of 1992, with thepossibility that this percentage will later be increased. Inreturn, the U.S. is likely to eliminate floor prices forcommodity chips; nevertheless, Japanese chip makers will beexpected to monitor themselves to ensure that pricing remains&quot;fair&quot; under the curious standards of anti-dumping law. Thesecompanies must also maintain detailed cost and price records;if there is any suspicion that prices are dropping too low,these records will have to be turned over to the U.S.government within 14 days under &quot;fast track&quot; antidumpingprocedures. This new monitoring and fast track system wouldstill be a price control regime; worse, it would be moreunpredictable, and hence more disruptive, than the regime itreplaced.   The U.S. semiconductor industry does not need governmentcoddling. To be sure, it lost out to the Japanese inhigh-volume commodity memory chips, where the premium is onmanufacturing efficiency. (By the way, IBM remains theworld's largest DRAM producer; it just doesn't sell them onthe open market.) These losses have been more than offset byvigorous growth in production of specialized,design-intensive chips, such as microprocessors,microcontrollers and custom-logic parts. In this vitalmarket, which is already a third larger than the market formemory chips, American producers are leading the Japanese andeven expanding their lead.   Advocates of high-tech protectionism like to think ofthemselves as sophisticated practitioners of &quot;strategic&quot;trade policy. In fact, though, they repeat the same hamhandedmistakes that have left us with managed trade messes inagriculture, textiles and steel. In attempting to outguessthe marketplace, bureaucrats invariably side withhighly-visible vested interests against the hidden anddispersed beneficiaries of change. There's no chance thatthis will ever change; dealing with established interestgroups is what governments do. In high-tech as elsewhere, thebest trade policy remains what Winston Churchill described as&quot;masterly inactivity.&quot;   ---   Mr. Lindsey is a trade lawyer in Washington, D.C.</TEXT></DOC>
