They dismantled it but found nothing, leaving them with a useless heap of parts. Incensed, the Chinese handed the U.S. delegation a whopping bill.    The incident illustrates the suspicion and irritation that persists between China and the U.S. a decade after the restoration of full diplomatic ties. Though Washington and Beijing have made progress in their relations since the Reagan administration took office in 1980, the two sides continue to disagree, sometimes strongly and in public, on fundamental bilateral and international issues.    Mr. Shultz begins his official visit today. During 40 hours, spread over three days, he is expected to grill Chinese leaders on a range of sensitive topics, especially China's continuing military support for the Khmer Rouge resistance in Cambodia, and Beijing's arms sales in the Middle East. The U.S. official is likely to receive an earful of complaints in return, particularly concerning U.S. restrictions on exports of high-technology items to China.    Of course, the two sides will toast recent achievements in U.S.-China relations. Two-way trade increased to $10.4 billion last year, more than four times the level of 1979. U.S. investment in China has risen steadily, to a total commitment of about $3 billion. And there now are more than 20,000 Chinese studying in the U.S.    &quot;China and the U.S. are friends, though not allies,&quot; U.S. Ambassador Winston Lord recently told foreign journalists in Beijing. &quot;We have parallel policies on many issues, though on others we have significant disagreements.&quot;    One thorny issue Mr. Shultz will take up is Cambodia, where peaceful settlement of the decade-old stalemate increasingly seems possible. Both China and the U.S. are encouraging plans for peace negotiations involving the three main Cambodian resistance groups and the Vietnamese-backed government in Phnom Penh.    But the U.S. is troubled by China's continuing support for the Khmer Rouge, the largest and most powerful resistance faction, which is generally believed to have been responsible, directly or indirectly, for the deaths of millions of Cambodians before Vietnamese forces ousted them from power in 1978. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former Cambodian leader, said this week he was withdrawing from the resistance because the Khmer Rouge continues to attack his forces along the Thai-Cambodia border.    Chinese officials privately have told the U.S. that they oppose a major role for the Khmer Rouge or its leader, Pol Pot, in any future Cambodian government. The Chinese also have told the U.S. that they would prefer to see a &quot;non-socialist&quot; government, headed by Prince Sihanouk. But China continues to arm the Khmer Rouge, intelligence sources say.    Mr. Shultz hopes to get China's assurance that it will do what it can to ensure that the Khmer Rouge don't return to power. But, while Beijing might agree to do so in private, no one expects a public statement to that effect. The Chinese view the Khmer Rouge as the most effective means for pressuring Vietnam to withdraw from Cambodia, as Hanoi has promised.    For years, both the U.S. and China have been relatively content with the Cambodian stalemate, which has been costly for Vietnam, a foe of both Washington and Beijing. But both countries now seem hopeful of resolving the issue, diplomats in Beijing say. The U.S. wants peace along the border with Thailand, a U.S. ally. Moreover, ending the Cambodian conflict could lead to normalization of U.S. relations with Vietnam, which currently depends heavily on the Soviet Union.    If Vietnam does withdraw, conditions might also become ripe for a high-level summit between China and the Soviet Union. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly said that Beijing and Moscow can't normalize relations until the Russian-backed Vietnamese leave Cambodia. The U.S. welcomes a Beijing-Moscow thaw, which Washington has concluded isn't likely to evolve into the kind of strategic alliance they maintained in the 1950s.    Another thorny Sino-American issue is arms sales. When Mr. Shultz was here last year he urged China to stop sales to Iran of Silkworm surface-to-surface missiles, currently a threat to U.S. shipping in the Persian Gulf. Most U.S. officials believe China has stopped such sales, but intelligence is difficult to interpret and some believe that China, in its desire to earn foreign exchange, hasn't cut off sales entirely.    U.S. protests about Silkworm sales led Washington in October to suspend plans to liberalize exports of sophisticated technology to China. Five months later, after a visit to Washington by then Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian, the U.S. relented. But progress has been slow.    The Americans also are troubled by recent disclosures that China has been selling to Saudi Arabia intermediate-range ballistic missiles that can be equipped with nuclear warheads. U.S. officials also suspect that China has talked with Syria about the sale of short-range ballistic missiles, though Beijing denies it.    Mr. Shultz also is expected to reiterate appeals to the Chinese to do what they can to prevent their North Korean ally from disrupting this year's summer Olympic games in South Korea. Mr. Shultz will travel to Seoul from Beijing to continue his swing through Asia. </TEXT></DOC>
