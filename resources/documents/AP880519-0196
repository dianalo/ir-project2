The bill, passed 277-104, would increase spending by Congressand its agencies by 1.6 percent above current levels, including a16.5 percent hike for its leadership staffs.   The House rejected several amendments aimed at freezing orcutting costs, accepting only a symbolic $5 million reduction inits estimated postage costs.   For the third straight day, the House approved an amendmentrequiring that no federal funds go to a workplace where drugs areused, sold or made.   The provision, offered by Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., wasapproved 286-98, despite complaints that it was an election-yeargimmick that wouldn't solve the problem.   The amendment gives ``the impression that we've done somethingabout drugs, but ... we won't have done a whit,'' said Rep. DavidObey, D-Wis., who called it a ``garbage'' amendment.   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., was forced to withdraw her amendmentrequiring Congress to obey the civil rights law it imposed on therest of the nation 24 years ago. The amendment banningdiscrimination based on race, sex, religion, age, national originor physical handicap was deemed out of order on the spending bill.   The House bill, by tradition, does not include the allowance forthe Senate, where the bill was sent. The House AppropriationsCommittee estimated the Senate portion would add $413 million tothe total.   The bill did not address the question of pay raises for membersof the House and Senate, leaving that until later in the year whenPresident Reagan makes his annual recommendation.</TEXT></DOC>
