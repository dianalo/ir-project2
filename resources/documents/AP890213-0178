(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   P.T. Bailey was a partner in an oil fieldboat company _ until he almost lost everything. Now he packs crabsat a brand new fish plant he started.   ``I was lucky to survive with my pants on,'' he said.   A lot of people in Morgan City were lucky. While most of theLouisiana coast has been decimated by the collapse of the oilindustry, Morgan City has been staging something of a rebound.   Shipyards are hiring again and working two shifts. Fish plants,such as Bailey's, are teaching unemployed oil workers the ways ofthe sea. City employees got back 9 percent of a 15 percent wage cut.Sales tax collections are $680,000 over projections.   ``We've had to make do with different things,'' said Mayor CedricLaFleur, who has used a $3 million ``rainy day'' fund and profitsfrom the city-owned utility to spark new businesses.   For Bailey, the city built a new road so he could build his planton a waterway.   At the Conrad Industries shipyard, employment has increased 100percent over the last year, said general manager Ronald Chiasson.The firm, which used to build nothing but oil field boats, hassurvived by switching to construction barges, floating dry docks forSouth America and even an excursion boat for the Bahamas.   ``We just weren't willing to give up,'' Chiasson said. ``You haveto go with the flow.''   At the Wheel House Lounge, on what was once a rough-and-tumblewaterfront area, patrons talk of surviving, not partying.   ``There's been almost a 100 percent change in character in twoyears,'' said John E. Roe, the owner.   ``If you're going to live down here, you're going to have to knowhow to be a survivor. This town survives because these people knowhow to survive,'' said patron Peggy Sue Miller.   At the Morgan City Bank, the marquee recently invoked a popularsong to express the community's sentiment. ``Don't Worry, BeHappy,'' the sign said.   But despite the hopeful signs, Morgan City is still wrestlingwith the same problems as much of Louisiana.   Unemployment still runs between 10 and 11 percent. ``But hell,''LaFleur said, ``it used to be 27 percent.'' The city has lost 1,500people, but recently gained about 500, LaFleur said.   That population loss is felt in the city's two major Catholicchurches, which have lost one-sixth of their families, the Rev. JohnGallen of Sacred Heart Church said.   ``Most of our young people have gone to Atlanta, Jacksonville,Fla., and places like that where there is employment,'' Gallen said.   The church has started a thrift store and runs seminars onbusiness and financial affairs, and depression.   ``People seem to be cautiously optimistic,'' Gallen said.``Remember, there are still a lot of people in business just hangingon.''   Survivors like Bailey, who now ships Louisiana crabs to Maryland,say they don't miss the wild days at all.   ``I've got mixed emotions about what I'm doing. I feel bitterabout how much money I lost, and how I had to start over again,'' hesaid.   And if the price of oil should skyrocket again, Bailey willresist temptation and stick with fish.   ``If this business goes, and I think it will, I just don't feelconfident enough in the oil industry to invest any money in it,'' hesaid.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Scott McCartney is the AP Southwest regionalreporter, based in Dallas.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Feb. 20</NOTE></DOC>
