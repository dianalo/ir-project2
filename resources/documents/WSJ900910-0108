Perched atop a 12-story cooling tank at this sprawlingseaside steelworks, Takeo Harada waxes rhapsodic about hisfavorite topic: saving energy.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;In Japan, we love spending money on contraptions likethis,&quot; shouts the 30-year-old engineer, gesturing proudly ata tangle of pipes and turbines. The object of his affectionis a &quot;coke dry quencher,&quot; a $5.6 million apparatus thathelped his company, Nippon Steel Corp., slash the energyrequired to produce a ton of steel nearly 25%. At a plantusing 1% of the energy consumed in Japan -- enough to power acity of two million -- such savings matter.   Like most Japanese manufacturers, Nippon Steel pursuesenergy conservation with near-religious devotion. Theenthusiasm at the Kimitsu plant goes a long way towardexplaining why this resource-poor country has the world'smost fuel-efficient economy -- and why Japan is theindustrialized nation least likely to be knocked for a loopby a short-term surge in oil prices stemming from the PersianGulf crisis.   No country was harder hit than Japan by the oil shocks of1973 and 1979. And no country subsequently insulated itselfbetter from the vagaries of world oil markets. Some expertscontend that if the rest of the industrialized world hadworked equally hard over the past decade to reduce dependenceon foreign oil, the U.S. might not have found it necessary tosend troops to the Mideast and the global economy might notface such a recession threat.   How did Japan get so energy-efficient? Can the rest of theworld learn from it?   &quot;The lessons for America are so simple they're almostbanal,&quot; says Richard Samuels, a specialist on Japanese energypolicy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &quot;Oil is anonrenewable resource. It's possible to reduce consumption,but first you have to decide you really want to.&quot;   Japan really wanted to. But will alone wasn't enough. Theproduction engineers at the Kimitsu Steel Works and thousandsof other Japanese factories didn't collectively decide, inreaction to enormous popular pressure, to push energyconservation. Instead, the government spurred theirenthusiasm through a carefully coordinated, long-rangeprogram that continues even today. One clear lesson to learnfrom Japan is that forcing core industries to become moreenergy-efficient is one thing that government can do well.   A second lesson is that government has a hard time forcingindividuals to be energy-efficient. Not that Japan didn'ttry. During the 1979 oil crisis, then-Prime MinisterMasayoshi Ohira tried to set an example by arriving at acabinet meeting sporting a tacky short-sleeved suit coat; ifothers would adopt the &quot;safari look,&quot; he said, the countrycould stop wasting energy on air conditioning. The safarilook didn't catch on.   Japanese consumers aren't helping much to save energytoday, either. Now wealthier, they are demanding moreappliances; Japanese households have, on the average, two TVsets, a refrigerator and an air conditioner. On weekends,Tokyo's expressways are jammed with vacationers creepingtoward the beaches in big, gas-thirsty 4x4s. Ice-cold airfloods from the doors of department stores to the swelteringsidewalks in Ginza, the Tokyo retailing district. Neon signsof cabarets, bars and pachinko parlors glitter all night.   This relative complacency was spawned in part by severalyears of cheap oil, and Japan's energy demand has grown 5% ineach of the past three years. Japanese industrial companies,however, have continued to become more energy-efficient, somuch so that some see little room for improvement if furtherefforts are needed.   Tokyo Electric Power Co. switched to nuclear power andslashed its dependence on oil by two-thirds. Asahi Glass Co.rebuilt its kilns and modified production processes to cutenergy use 40% in a decade. A municipal train system innorthern Japan recycles heat generated by its engines to runair conditioning. Japanese plant equipment, generally newerand more efficient than that in U.S. factories, increasesJapan's relative energy efficiency.   Yet 20 years ago, even before the 1973 oil embargo,Japan's economy was the world's most energy-efficient; itconsumed less than two-thirds as much energy, afteradjustment for differences in economic size, as did the U.S.In part, Japan's lower consumption was, and is, attributableto its geographical compactness, population density andsuperb public transportation.   Since then, all the major industrialized countries haveimproved energy-efficiency by roughly a quarter. But Japanhas improved by a third, even though it was already moreefficient and additional gains were more difficult. Moreover,Japan, unlike other countries, has focused on reducing itsdependence on oil, almost all of which must be imported.Between the 1973 oil crisis and 1987, Japan's economic outputmore than doubled, yet its oil imports fell 25%. (U.S.reliance on foreign oil during the same period actuallyincreased, from 36% to 43% of total oil usage.)   And Japan has diversified its oil suppliers. In 1973, itimported nearly two-thirds of its oil from four countries inthe politically volatile Mideast -- Saudi Arabia, Iran, theUnited Arab Emirates and Kuwait. By the end of the 1980s,Japan had doubled the number of its main Mideast oilsuppliers. Until Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Tokyo carefullymaintained close diplomatic ties to most Persian Gulfnations; during the eight-year Iraq-Iran war, Japanese aidflowed to both sides -- and oil flowed from both to Japan. Inaddition, Japan is buying more and more oil from otherproducers, such as China.   But what really sets Japan apart from other oil-consumingcountries is its patient pursuit of energy conservation anddiversification throughout the 1980s, even after oil pricesplunged. The U.S., more sensitive to market signals, didn't.The contrast is a classic illustration of what Ronald Morse,an energy specialist at the Economic Strategy Institute inWashington, calls the two countries' &quot;different philosophies&quot;about conserving energy.   &quot;The Japanese are doing what we started during the Carteradministration. The difference is just that they continuedwhat we abandoned,&quot; Mr. Morse says. &quot;Japan is concerned abouteconomic vulnerability; so, it tries to insulate itself frominjury from other nations.&quot; He adds:   &quot;In the U.S., the whole thrust has been to deregulate andto keep the price of energy cheap. But that means thatsometimes we have to use military might to keep the sourcesof cheap energy open.&quot;   With peace-minded Japan ruling out military intervention,the country emphasizes conservation. And those efforts beginwhere it matters most -- in manufacturing, which consumeshalf of Japan's energy.   This concentration plays to a crucial Japanese strength:bureaucratic management of industry. Mr. Morse creditsJapan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry for muchof its success in conserving energy. &quot;This is one area whereyou can say that the controls the Japanese government hasover the market really worked,&quot; he says.   MITI's energy controls are characteristically thorough.Since the 1979 oil shock, MITI officials have kept closewatch on the energy consumption of 5,000 factories.Designated factories have to appoint from one to as many as10 energy-conservation engineers to monitor fuel efficiencyon the shop floor. Before the engineers can start work, theymust pass an examination so strict that most of them spendmore than a year preparing for it -- and even then eight outof 10 flunk. Those who pass keep daily tabs on theirfactory's energy use and regularly report on progress toMITI. Failing to meet targets incurs no sanctions, but thefear of antagonizing MITI's powerful bureaucrats ensurescooperation.   MITI also openly urged companies to rely less on oil andmore on coal and natural gas -- both obtainable inpolitically stable nations. Nippon Steel's Kimitsu plant, forexample, converted its blast furnaces to coal in the early1980s and slashed oil's share of its energy supply to almostzero from about 20%. Further savings were achieved from thecoke dry quencher, which recycles hot gas that used to escapeas molten iron ore cooled.   Moreover, MITI lets Japanese energy suppliers, includingoil and gas companies and electric utilities, keep theirprices -- and profits -- high, provided the windfalls arechanneled into energy research. That amounts to an energytax, some say, but the artificially high cost of petroleumproducts hastens the transition to new energy sources. In1987, MITI funneled more than 117 billion yen ($830 million)of such profits into energy research -- more than to allother ministry projects combined -- and that doesn't countthe billions MITI forced utilities to spend on similarprojects.   As a result, Japan now has the world's best technology forsolar cells, storage and transport of liquid natural gas, andgenerators producing electricity from gasified coal and seawater. &quot;Sure, a lot of this research is risky,&quot; Mr. Morseconcedes. But, he adds, &quot;relatively speaking, the projectsdidn't cost all that much, and probably at least 60% of themhave been effective. And now that investment's paying off.&quot;   Even nuclear power has helped, despite often-emotionalopposition in the only country to suffer from nuclearweapons. Before the first oil shock, Japan had virtually nonuclear-power capacity; today, it has 38 operating nuclearfacilities, which supply about 9% of its total energy. Thegovernment wants to nearly double that by the end of thedecade. Thanks to the government push to rely more on coal,natural gas and nuclear power, oil's share of Japan's totalenergy demand fell to about 56.9% from 77.4% between 1973 and1987.   Not all of Japan's energy management has been orchestratedby bureaucrats. Once the program was under way, evencompanies whose factories weren't supervised discovered thatless dependence on energy meant less vulnerability to oilshocks and price surges.   At Hino Motors Ltd., Japan's biggest maker of medium andheavy trucks, the results were stunning. Switches were addedto machine tools so they wouldn't idle when not in use.Machining oil was recycled. Heat-treatment rooms wereinsulated. Shop lighting and air conditioning were reduced.The upshot after a year: a 10% to 15% energy saving.   Japan has benefited, too, from industrial modernization.Since the late 1970s, the country has shifted from heavymanufacturing to cleaner, more fuel-efficient industries suchas consumer electronics and financial services. Thatrestructuring -- Japanese pundits describe it as the changefrom a ju-ko-cho-dai (heavy, thick, long, big) to akei-haku-tansho (light, thin, short, small) economy -- wasunder way before the oil shocks; high energy prices merelyaccelerated it.   By 1985, for example, Japan's aluminum-smelting industryhad all but disappeared -- only a single smelter is stillworking in Japan -- because it couldn't compete withhydroelectric-powered smelters in Canada, the U.S. andBrazil. Some manufacturers are taking advantage of thosecheaper energy sources by moving production closer to them.Oji Paper Co. cut its energy costs almost 60% by shiftingsome paper-making operations to Canada.   However, keeping energy-conservation gains alreadyachieved isn't easy. At Hino Motors, executives say energyuse is rising again because tight labor conditions areforcing its factories to rely more heavily on machinery.   With the Iraqi invasion, the government has had a freshreason to promote conservation. Hallways in government officebuildings are dark again, and government offices areuncomfortably warm. MITI has asked drivers not to go fasterthan 50 miles an hour and to keep their air conditioning at28 degrees Celsius.   However, many energy experts here admit to doubting thatsuch symbolic measures have much effect on consumptionnationwide. &quot;We all think we're rich now,&quot; says Kenji Mogami,a MITI official. &quot;It's difficult to get people who thinkthey're rich to make sacrifices.&quot;   And it's more difficult to get people who already havemade sacrifices to bite the bullet even harder. At SumitomoChemical Co., stringent measures cut energy consumptionsharply in an industry in which most products require oil toproduce; today, the company relies on petroleum for only halfits products.   &quot;We and the Japanese petrochemical industry as a whole dida great deal to rationalize our process already,&quot; complainsShoji Morimoto, an executive vice president at SumitomoChemical.   Thus, Japan may not be able to keep improving its energyconservation. &quot;We will have more difficulty in the future,&quot;says Shijuro Ogata, deputy governor of the government-runJapan Development Bank. &quot;There is much less room for Japan toconserve further.&quot;   ---                Importing Oil, Then...
