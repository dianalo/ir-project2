The success of the experiment, if confirmed by other scientists,could bolster Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's argument thatit is possible to verify the presence of nuclear weapons aboardships and submarines.   ``It was very successful,'' said Tom Cochran, an Americanphysicist with the Natural Resource Defense Council, a liberalWashington group that organized the experiment with the Soviet stateAcademy of Sciences.   But it remains possible for either side to hide weapons or shieldthem against detection by the type of devices used Wednesday,Cochran said.   Washington has balked at Soviet demands that the proposedStrategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which would cut superpower atomicarsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent, include a curb onnuclear-tipped cruise missiles aboard submarines.   U.S. Navy officers say they will not allow Soviets aboardAmerican submarines to conduct the intrusive inspections needed todetermine whether a cruise missile is carrying a conventional ornuclear warhead.   Soviet technology lags far behind American in the sophisticatedmissiles, which can be launched very close to an enemy's shore, canfly at altitudes too low for radar detection and deliver a nuclearpunch without warning against key coastal areas.   In Wednesday's Black Sea experiment, Soviet government andprivate American scientists used a variety of radiation detectiondevices to measure the emission of neutrons and gamma rays from anuclear wearhead on an SS-N-12 subsonic cruise missile aboard theSoviet missile cruiser Slava.   Among observers were three American congressmen, all Democrats:Reps. John Spratt, a member of the House Armed Services Committeefrom South Carolina, Bob Carr, from Michigan, and James Olin, ofVirginia. They were in Yalta, 750 miles south of Moscow and notavailable for comment immediately.   Cochran and other American scientists from Princeton and Stanforduniversities made their measurements with portable detectors placedalongside the deck launcher, less than a yard from the warhead.   Simultaneously, Soviet scientists from the academy's institutesof geochemistry and earth physics used radiation detection devicescarried in a military helicopter and a troop transport, said Cochran.   ``All the systems tested successfully,'' Cochran said in atelephone interview.   ``We detected the signature of the nuclear warhead in thelauncher'' he said. ``We used a portable germanium detector that weplaced alongside the launcher and got a strong signal from the U-235and the plutonium in the warhead.'' Plutonium and U-232, a form ofuranium, are two main elements used in nuclear weapons.   At the same time, Soviet scientists circling in a helicopter 65yards above the Slava used a neutron detector that indicated thepresence of plutonium on the ship.   Soviet scientists aboard a troop transport circling 70 yards fromthe cruiser used a sodium iodide gamma ray detector that registeredradiation from the warhead, said Cochran.   ``None of the tools by themselves is adequate to verify limits onnuclear weapons, so you have to put together a package to cover theshortcomings of various systems'' he said.   Cochran said the scientists want to do a similar experiment inthe United States, but the American Navy has refused to cooperate.</TEXT></DOC>
