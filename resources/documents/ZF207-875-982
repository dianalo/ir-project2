(Technology Advances)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Maliniak, David.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) researchers havedeveloped diamond-film coating processes with potential forpassive and active applications in semiconductor devices.andP;  Theplasma-assisted physical-vapor deposition (PAPVD) processdeveloped by Rointan Bunshah, Dr Chandra Deshpandey and otherresearchers at the UCLA School of Engineering and Applied Scienceevaporates graphite by an electron beam to form carbon vapors thatare introduced into a gas plasma containing hydrogen.andP;  The gasplasma holds the material to be coated, with the resultingreaction depositing a diamond film on the material's surface.andO;PAPVD works at temperatures lower than 350 degrees Celsius, incomparison to the chemical-vapor deposition processes that requiretemperatures between 850 and 1,000 degrees Celsius.andP;  PAPVD is alsomore promising in terms of scaling the process to coat wafer-sizedareas.andP;  Potential commercial applications for the process includehigh-power and GaAs-microwave devices and hard disks.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Semiconductor PreparationScientific ResearchNew TechniqueResearch and DevelopmentSemiconductorsTechnologyCalifornia, University of (Los Angeles).
