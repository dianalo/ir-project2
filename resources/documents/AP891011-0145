In a review dated Oct. 3 by the inspector general's office atthe Department of Housing and Urban Development, investigators saidthere were possible violations of law or conflicts of interest inseveral areas, including procurement and contracting practices andthe use of non-profit corporations.   The report said the agency may have spent $3.8 million alone onquestionable contracts, including goods and services obtainedwithout competitive bidding.   The agency may have also overpaid one of its non-profitcorporations at least $255,344 for windows, screens and doors, thereview said. The remainder of the questioned spending included suchitems as unsupported payment vouchers and $129,000 in paid sickleave.   Apolonio Flores, the housing agency's executive director,disputed each of the 14 separate allegations. He defended the useof low-income housing funds for a Rotary membership, thesoliciation of $1,800 in donations from contractors and businessesfor a Hispanic chamber of commerce mixer, and said the non-profitcorporations saved the agency $3 million.   ``There's nothing we're not prepared to defend,'' Flores said.He accused HUD investigators of not examining his agency's recordsor talking with his staff, although there were seven or eight orthem in San Antonio for about three months.   The report said two of the agency's non-profit corporationsrealized receipts over expenses _ mostly through transactionsbetween the corporations and federally funded housing programs forthe poor _ but did not pass those savings on to low-income projects.   As a result, the housing authority ``may not have operated itshousing projects in the manner prescribed by Texas state law and aconflict of interest may have occured,'' the review said.   As of Jan. 31, the San Antonio Housing Assistance Corp. had abalance of $285,922 while the San Antonio Housing Facilities Corp.had a balance of $1.2 million and investments totaling nearly $4.8million.   Under Texas law, the report said, there does not appear to beany provision for the San Antonio housing authority to maintainsuch a fund balance.   ``Accordingly, the SAHAC might be required to use any excess ofreciepts over expenses soley to make decent, safe and sanitaryhousing available for persons of low income,'' the review said.   The report also said the housing authority, through the SanAntonio Housing Facilities Corp., purchased a private housingproject for $1.13 million that rents to non-low income individualsand families. Under Texas law, however, a housing authority mayrent or lease housing only to people of low income.   Of the $84,260 that the inspector general has recommended theagency be required to repay, $73,857 was charged to federalprograms for such items as banquets, computer hardware and officefurniture for the low-income housing projects, Rotary Clubmembership fees, and tax handbooks and publications.   Another $1,800 was improperly solicited from businesses andcontractors to pay for the chamber mixer in October 1988, thereport said.   The investigators made their recommendations for action to theHUD regional administrator in Fort Worth. The authority has 60 daysto respond to the review, while the administrator has six months todecide how to proceed.</TEXT></DOC>
