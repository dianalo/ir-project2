He is hiding in hisatomic-bomb-secure bunker directly under his government palace.&quot;;    Westernnews reports have spoken of such a complex under the palace, but details havebeen sketchy. The weekly did not say how it learned the details, and theycould not be independently confirmed.;    Bild said German companies,including one based in Munich, designed the bunker, which is 60 feet under thepalace, furnished it and &quot;worked for years to build it,&quot; but none wasidentified by name.;    Storage chambers are &quot;filled to the ceilings&quot; withfood and medicine and up to 25 people could hold out in the bunker for &quot;morethan a year without worry,&quot; the report says.;    The bunker is 2,160 squareyards and cost more than $100 million.;    Located on Jamia street, not farfrom the German embassy and the Tigris river, the bunker is directlyunderneath the presidential palace, which has been hit by American bombs, Bildsaid.;    The bunker's walls, ceiling and foundation are 6 feet thick andbuilt with special concrete for added strength, it says. The doors are made ofsteel-reinforced concrete a foot thick, and access is via German-builtelevators.;    The bunker can withstand heat of up to 572 degrees Fahrenheit,and a nuclear blast would produce only a slight vibration, Bild said.;    Itsaid the bunker is built on a rolling bearing system and swings up to 24inches so that the pressure waves don't crack it.;    Ducts and filters bringfresh air into the complex. Even the water for flushing the toilets isspecially processed so that chemical or biological agents can't enter thesystem, the newspaper said.;    An illustration accompanying the report showedluxuriously furnished quarters, including a living room with high-qualityleather furniture, some of it of French design. Adjacent to the living room isa swimming pool with dressing area, the report said.;    Saddam's bedroom hasa four-poster bed with a red silk canopy and a kitchen with a microwave,dishwasher and washing machine.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Hamburg, Germany  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910122  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  MAP  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  427  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday January 22, 199100022198,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
