Military sources said 13 people were injured and the argument wasnot political.   One said an officer of the Lebanese Forces, the main Christianmilitia, and his escort tried to jump the ski-lift line at Oyounel-Siman, a resort town in the Christian heartland 25 milesnortheast of the capital.   Warnings were shouted, and when the militiamen ignored them ``thequarrel erupted,'' the source said. ``Soldiers and militiamen hiteach other with ski poles without using any firearms.''   It was the first direct confrontation between Christian soldiersand members of the militia in a 14-year-old sectarian war that hasseen innumerable bloody battles between, and among, Moslem andChristian groups.   The source, who spoke anonymously like the others, said thedust-up was ``spontaneous, with no political significance,'' and was``quickly contained after urgent contacts between the commands ofthe two sides.''   Sources at the Lebanese Forces command described it asinsignficant.   Members of the Lebanese Forces, which has about 6,000 fighters,control Christian urban centers outside east Beirut, the capital'sChristian sector. About 20,000 army troopers control the Christiancountryside.</TEXT></DOC>
