 Interactive WYSIWYG document layout program.andP;  Designed forlong, structured documents (e.g., technical manuals), for multiplepublications with common formats, and for publications that are repeatedlyupdated.andP;  Less satisfactory for one-of-a-kind publications (display ads,design pieces) because the process of constructing new style sheets is atime-consuming overhead.andM;Platform.andP;  IBM-compatible, 80286 processor or better is recommended.andO;Requires 640K memory.andP;  Also needs mouse, graphics display.andP;  Not copyprotected, but disks are serialized.andP;  Professional Extension supports EMSmemory, allowing larger chapter files and more graphics.andM;Network Server version supports Novell Netware, IBM PC Net and 3Com 3Plusnetworks.andP;  It also supports EMS memory for both the base-level product andthe PE; we strongly recommend at least 1/2 MB.andP;  Some networks use so muchmemory as to make EMS mandatory.andM;Output.andP;  PostScript, PCL and Interpress languages are supported; drivers forJLaser, Xerox 4045, IBM Proprinter and Epson and N EC dot-matrix printers aresupplied.andP;  Some typesetter drivers are available through third parties.andM;Network Server adds network-specific printer support to minimize spooleroverflows, address multiple printers on the net.andM;File management.andP;  GEM standard file dialogs.andP;  Remembers where each of itsimported text files came from and writes changes back to those same files inthe original file formats.andP;  Network Server version supports chapter lockingand readonly style sheets, but does not lock text files.andP;  It partiallydetects file contention, but cannot prevent collisions.andP;  Additionalmanagement and revision-tracking functions available from third parties.andM;Text entry/editing.andP;  Imports text from a wide variety of word processors.andO;Interactive on-the-page editing.andP;  A '286 computer is not fast enough forextensive editing, but is readily usable for last-minute fixes and entry ofcaptions, pull quotes, etc.andP;  On a '386 machine, performance is sufficient forsmooth editing, but it isn't a replacement for a word processor; lacks authoraids such as spelling checking, search/replace, thesaurus.andM;Four mutually exclusive editing modes for frame attributes, style tagging,text editing, graphics.andP;  Professional Extension adds a nice table editor.andM;Composition.andP;  Fast interactive justification.andP;  Paragraph style tags controlall aspects of typography except column width and depth, which are set byframe size.andP;  Within a paragraph, some attributes (font, size, capitalization,styling) can be overridden across a range of text.andP;  Automatic pair kerning,manual spot kerning, generated fractions, fixed spaces, manual whitespaceadjustment are supported.andP;  Lacks type set-width adjustment, automatictracking.andP;  PE adds multilevel math editor.andM;Hyphenation is performed on each word when it enters the system, either atfile-import time or during text editing.andP;  Hence them is no speed penaltyduring recomposition.andP;  Two English hyphenation algorithms are supported: onefast but conservative (hyphenates few words, makes few mistakes), the otherslower but more exhaustive.andP;  User-expandable exception word dictionary.andP;  PEadds 130,000-word hyphenation dictionary, but you must have at least 1.2 MBof EMS memory to install it.andM;Justification routine obeys user-set minimum/optimum/maximum interwordspacing.andP;  Optionally flags loose lines in reversed video.andM;Graphics.andP;  Has tools for drawing lines, ellipses, boxes, fill patterns.andO;Imports vector and raster graphics in several PC and Macintosh formats;imports scanned photos in TIFF format.andP;  Imported graphics are not writtenback to source files; scaling and cropping values are stored with the chapterfile and reapplied each time the chapter is opened.andM;Paragraph style tags can automatically place boxes and multiple rules aroundspecific text components.andM;Pagination.andP;  Frames-rectangular containers for text, graphics and otherframes-can be moved or resized at any @me.andP;  Each frame can define up to eighttext columns with separate widths and gutter spacings.andP;  Each frame can haveits awn widow/orphan and column balancing settings.andP;  Multiple text streams,each in its own sequence of frames, can run through a chapter.andM;Generates indexes and table of contents; automatically numbers pages,illustrations and footnotes across multiple chapters.andP;  Illustrations andtables can float (anchored above or below text) or can be tied to a specificpage.andM;PE version adds vertical justification functions.andM;Support.andP;  Xerox offers telephone hotline technical advice for 60 days afteryou send in your registration card.andP;  (if Xerox hasn't received the card, itstarts the clock running with the first phone call.) Several levels ofextended support contracts are available.andM;Pricing.andP;  Base-level standalone product is Ventura Publisher 2.0, priced at$895 list.andP;  Widely discounted through mail-order channels.andP;  ProfessionalExtension sold separately for $595.andP;  Network Server version costs $1,295; itprovides network installation and one base-level user seat.andP;  Additionalsimultaneous sessions require purchase of additional standalone base-level(and PE, if desired) products so that their serial numbers can be registeredwith the server.andM;Xerox Corp.andP;  has exclusive worldwide distribution rights for VenturaPublisher products.andP;  For further information, contact Xerox SoftwareMarketing Services, P.O.andP;  Box 660512, Dallas, Texas.andP;  In the U.S., phone(800) 822-8221.andM;File Locking the Right WayandM;In addition to locking chapters, Ventura should lock each component that itis able to write: text files and style sheets, (Ventura does not write backto graphic files; the scaling and cropping information for each image is keptwith the chapter and reapplied each time the chapter is opened.)andM;If a chapter needs to load a locked component, it should notify the user atthe time of opening the file and give the opportunity either to proceed witha read-only version of that component, to load an editable file under a newname or to skip over that component.andP;  The essential problem is that aread-only component may already be obsolete; whether that is importantdepends on the user's purpose at the moment.andP;  If a component has beenskipped, Ventura should assume that this is a temporary condition; it shouldkeep the component in the list of file names, perhaps with an asterisk by thename.andP;  If the component had earlier been placed in a frame, the frame shouldbe displayed in a distinctive way and not as an empty frame.andM;Ventura-4ndeed, any network-ready program-should also give the user a way tofind out who has locked the component; it should supply the perpetrator'sname, along with other useful identification such as the network address,session number or node identification.andP;  The user may wish to ask the otherperson to release the file or inquire when it will be free.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
