It addresses the design changes that have been prompted by theexperiences gained and analyses critically the lacuna in design effortsso that learning from the past, appropriate course corrections can bemade. The need for wider application of state-of-the-art longwall equipmentand systems, including automation, face monitoring and condition monitoringfor higher performance levels are highlighted and the application ofsingle entry retreat shortwall system advocated. 19 refs., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
