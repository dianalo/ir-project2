The rescue is scheduled for February 1992, said theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration, during thefirst flight of a new space shuttle, called Endeavour.According to the plan, the shuttle will snag the Intelsat-6satellite with its robot arm and bring it into the shuttle'scargo bay. There astronauts will attach a new rocket motorthat the shuttle will lug into space. The satellite then willbe lifted out of the shuttle and sent into an orbit 22,300miles above the Earth.</LP><TEXT>   The mission recalls the glory days of the shuttle, beforethe Challenger disaster, when NASA retrieved or repaired foursatellites and expected to make a business out of it. ButNASA's plans have changed drastically since then -- theshuttle flies far less frequently than hoped for, and itdoesn't carry commercial cargoes -- so the planned retrievalprobably won't be a precursor to other work.   But NASA was happy to accept the Intelsat offer anyway.Space Shuttle Director Robert Crippen said the mission wouldhelp NASA in planning for the construction in space of itsproposed orbiting space station. It would also &quot;once againdemonstrate the versatility of the space shuttle,&quot; he said.   Intelsat, a global telecommunications consortium, beganinvestigating the possibility of a retrieval after a MartinMarietta Corp. rocket boosted the $157 million satellite intoa useless orbit in March. Martin Marietta later said it hadmessed up the wiring on its $115 million Titan III booster.   Intelsat, which had self-insured the project, said thatretrieving the satellite would be cheaper than building andlaunching a new one. The telecommunications organization saidthat it expects the reboosted satellite, which will carrytelephone calls, television and computer data, to last 10years.   The Intelsat decision was a setback for Orbital SciencesCorp., a Fairfax, Va., rocket company that had hoped to sellIntelsat one of its satellite rocket motors and hadpublicized a prospective rescue mission. Instead, Intelsatchose a motor built by Hughes Aircraft Co., the GeneralMotors Corp. subsidiary that built the satellite.   NASA charges $150 million for cargo that fills up theentire shuttle bay. The space agency said it figured that thesatellite rocket motor would take up about 60% of the shuttlecargo, resulting in a charge of between $90 million and $97million. That pricing scheme has long been controversial withcommercial space advocates. They say it underestimates thetrue cost of operating the space shuttle, which they put atabout $350 million, and represents unfair competition.</TEXT></DOC>
