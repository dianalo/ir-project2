But that didn't stop the House of Representatives last month from approving a ban on nearly all U.S. investment and trade with South Africa.    The Senate, however, is growing more cautious, partly because of a dawning realization that trade wars cut both ways. This one has begun to cost the jobs of U.S. workers as well. What looked like a cheap way of winning U.S. votes is becoming more and more expensive.    Today, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hear testimony that includes a Wharton Econometrics finding that the 1985 U.S. embargo on South African coal backfired against U.S. coal producers. After the ban, the South Africans launched a price war to try to preserve their share of the world market. The bottom line, according to Wharton, was a net loss of $250 million in revenues by U.S. coal exporters in 1986 and 1987. The National Coal Association counts 3,000 to 7,000 lost U.S. mining jobs.    This year's House bill, among other things, would ban imports of South African chrome and platinum, though some would be allowed if a President labeled them &quot;essential.&quot; What the bill's sponsors ignore is that there is growing support among South Africa's whites for countersanctions to deny the U.S. even &quot;essential&quot; imports and cripple U.S. industry.    Now, purchases through third parties theoretically could counter such threats. But chrome already is in short supply world-wide, squeezing some domestic stainless-steel producers even without countersanctions. The specialty-steel trade group says a further curtailment &quot;would be nothing short of disaster.&quot;    U.S. sanctions have accomplished one thing. They've stirred up reactionary opposition in South Africa to the government's reforms. Hard-line pro-apartheid candidates for the October municipal elections are attracting sympathetic crowds with their attacks on the government as a timid servant of the wealthy mining conglomerates. They are demanding retaliation against sanctions.    As the Journal's Neil Behrmann reported Tuesday, some South Africans believe the government might take advantage of the soaring world-wide demand for strategic metals by reducing supplies. Industry analysts also tell us the South Africans could charge U.S. customers a premium and fill orders for Asian and European customers first. South African chrome producers already have cut deliveries and dropped several spot contracts in the U.S. Domestic buyers of chromium reportedly are being charged 71 cents a pound compared with 67.5 cents a pound for European customers.    Even if South Africa chooses not to use its leverage in minerals, the House bill's ban on South African trade will have a whiplash effect throughout the U.S. economy. Affected businesses would have to seek new markets for $1.2 billion worth of exports. Within six months investors would have to sell $4.5 billion worth of shares in South African firms. International Investors Inc., the leading U.S. gold-oriented mutual fund, says holders of gold stocks would suffer a one-time loss of over $1 billion.    Until now, sanctions backers in Congress have been able to use South Africa for their own domestic political purposes without taking into account the full costs. The suffering that sanctions have inflicted on blacks and the loss of U.S. influence in the region have not impressed them much. But the next round will do more severe damage on their own constituents. That will be something to think about as the Senate debates whether to second the scorched-earth policy the House has adopted. </TEXT></DOC>
