Brown IIIStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> AMR LABORAIRLINES (AIR) </IN><DATELINE> DALLAS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., and the union that represents its 10,000 flight attendants rejected a federal mediator's offer of binding arbitration in their contract talks.    Under the Federal Railway Labor Act, the rejection triggered a 30-day cooling-off period that started yesterday. If American and its union can't reach a settlement by then, the airline can impose its latest contract offer or lock out its flight attendants. The Association of Professional Flight Attendants also would be free to strike, but it has said it doesn't plan to do so.    A mediator from the National Mediation Board in Washington will continue to try to bring the two sides to a settlement during the cooling-off period, which expires at 12:01 a.m. EST April 25. A spokesman for the board said it offered arbitration because the talks had reached an impasse.    An American spokesman said, &quot;We will continue to try to reach an agreement during the cooling-off period, and we honestly think we will reach an agreement.&quot;    But a date hasn't been set for returning to the bargaining table. And the battle has become increasingly confrontational in recent days.    On Wednesday, American fired three more flight attendants for distributing at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport leaflets that the carrier termed &quot;malicious, disparaging, and harmful to the company.&quot; That brings to 20 the total number of attendants that American has fired since the union began handing out the pamphlets last Sunday. The union is seeking a temporary restraining order from a federal court in Fort Worth, Texas, to reverse the terminations and block any more firings.    Union members also demonstrated yesterday outside the New York headquarters of Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. as a first step in its so-called corporate campaign. In a corporate campaign, a union puts pressure on a company's financial partners in an effort to get them to press for a settlement. Equitable's Alliance Capital Management Group is AMR's biggest shareholder, with about 12% of the common shares outstanding.    American called for federal mediation last month after the contract talks, which began in August, stalled over the issue of pay for starting flight attendants. The mediator, who has participated in the contract talks since Feb. 24, offered arbitration after the union rejected American's March 11 contract proposal.    American said that in its proposal, it offered total pay raises of as much as 37% during the three-year contract. The carrier also said it agreed to modify its two-tier wage scale, under which flight attendants hired since 1983 are paid significantly less than senior attendants. Under the new contract, American said the lower-scale flight attendants would jump to the higher scale after 10 years.    But the union rejected the proposal, saying the wage scales really wouldn't merge until the 15th year and would retain a disparity in benefits between the two scales. The union wants the scales to merge in the first year.    Patt Gibbs, the union's president, said that if American unilaterally imposes its new contract on the attendants, &quot;You can imagine the service at the airline will start deteriorating.&quot; For that reason, she said, she is &quot;confident&quot; the company will continue to negotiate with the union even if the cooling-off period expires without a settlement.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, AMR shares closed at $55, up 87.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
