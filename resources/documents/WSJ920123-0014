Strong fourth-quarter finishes resulted in recordfull-year profit for Golden West Financial Corp. and GreatWestern Financial Corp. and a second-best year for H.F.Ahmanson. Glenfed Inc. and Coast Savings Financial Inc., twoof the weaker big thrifts in the state, also turned in solidperformances now that their need to reserve for bad loans hasevidently abated.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There were no surprises,&quot; said Joseph Jolson, a thriftanalyst with Montgomery Securities.   Loan-loss provisions were down sharply. Ahmanson, thenation's largest thrift, which earned $64 million -- a hugejump from year-earlier profit of $475,000 -- took a $61.9million provision, down from $95.7 million a year ago.Glenfed, with net income of $20.5 million, took a $48.8million charge, down from $153 million. Glenfed had ayear-earlier loss of $113.7 million.   Most of the thrifts' problem loans do continue to rise,but that increase stems primarily from home-mortgagedelinquencies rather than troubled commercial real estate.Bad home loans require fewer reserves because they typicallyresult in relatively modest losses that are easy to predict.   Meanwhile, the thrifts' net interest margins, or thedifference between their cost of funds and what they earnfrom loans and investments, were at record levels, in partbecause the drop in lending rates has trailed the drop inrates thrifts pay their depositors. At Ahmanson, the spreadfor the quarter was 3.27%, up from 2.71% a year earlier.Great Western's figure was 3.92%, up from 2.95%. That bonanzamay not last in 1992. &quot;Margins won't get any better, and theywill probably narrow,&quot; says Mr. Jolson, adding that loangrowth will stagnate.   Mr. Jolson says that barring a robust economic recovery,the California thrifts' earnings will flatten out by thesecond quarter of 1992, although the current quarter shouldbe strong, up 40% or so.   Coast Savings reported net of $10.2 million, although thatincluded about $18 million in gains from loan sales, whicharen't considered a dependable source of income. Still, CoastSavings was much improved from a year earlier, when it neededa $52.7 million extraordinary gain to earn $50.1 million.   ---                        1991              1990                     in      per        in      per     %                  millions   share   millions   share   chg.
