<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-04-1014 </DOCNO><TEXT>The possibility of using a two-band superconductor model including theeffects of electron scattering by lattice defects and correlation interactionof wideband and narrow-band electrons for describing the kinetic propertiesof high-Tc superconductors in the normal state is discussed. The specificcharacteristics of relaxation processes in the electron system of narrow-bandconductors are identified. These include non-Born impurity scatteringin the band overlap region and anomalous amplification of electron-electronscattering in the case of a partially filled narrow band. The kineticand thermodynamic properties of the two-band model are compared for differentvalues of its microscopic parameters. 10 references.</TEXT></DOC>
