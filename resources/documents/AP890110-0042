GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of Vietnamese boat peopledrowned or otherwise died violent deaths last year after Thaiauthorities turned the refugees back to sea, a U.S. human rightsgroup charged today.   The government rejected the report as ``prejudiced'' and said allrefugee boats were allowed to land.   The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, in its 193-page report,detailed several alleged incidents of murder and brutality by Thaiauthorities.   It said Thai pirates ``ravaged, raped, and killed hundreds ofVietnamese boat people'' pushed out to sea.   The New York-based committee said Thailand continued to refuserefugees permission to land despite its January 1988 announcementthat it renounced the policy. In addition, about 330,000 Cambodianand Vietnamese refugees were exposed to lawlessness and cross-borderwarfare in camps along the Cambodian frontier last year, says thereport entitled ``Refuge Denied.''   ``Accounts by survivors received by the Lawyers Committee throughtheir relatives in the U.S. reveal a pattern of murder, sexual abuseand robbery by Thai security forces authorized to `push off' newVietnamese arrivals,'' the report declared.   A written statement from the Foreign Ministry described thereport as ``unbalanced, prejudiced and at times sensational.'' Itsaid all refugee boats were permitted to land and that arrivals weretaken to a special camp in cooperation with the U.N. HighCommissioner for Refugees.   Kasit Piromya, chief of the Department of InternationalOrganizations, disputed the committee's assertion that hundreds ofVietnamese drowned.   ``Most of the fatalities that occurred resulted from capsizing ofunseaworthy boats outside of Thai territorial waters,'' he said inthe statement.   He said piracy against Vietnamese boat people declined fromattacks on 77 percent of boats in 1981 to 10 percent in 1988. TheU.N. refugee agency also has reported a decrease in attacks.   Thailand has been praised for giving temporary asylum to hundredsof thousands of Cambodian, Vietnamese and Laotian refugees who havefled their homelands since the communist victories in Indochina in1975.   But the Thais have been criticized for the treatment some localauthorities give refugees, reluctance to act against pirates andpolicies that sometimes cause undue suffering to those seekingasylum.   In one case, the report says, 74 Vietnamese refugees who came viaCambodia in June 1988 were surrounded by Thai soldiers and towedback to sea in four small boats. The soldiers abducted eight younggirls, shot at one of the boats, tried to ram another and abandonedthe survivors, the report says.   It says that in another case that month, only two boys survivedof 61 Vietnamese who were towed to sea in small boats and fired onby soldiers with automatic rifles.   ``Thai fishermen have interpreted the push-back policy andattitudes expressed by Thai officials and police as a mandate torape, rob and murder Vietnamese boat people,'' the report said.   Officials should ``ensure respect for the basic human rights ofthe Vietnamese boat people,'' it said. It accused Thailand ofdeterring refugees by creating poor living conditions at refugeecamps.   The report was based on interviews and trips to Thailand bycommittee members last year.</TEXT></DOC>
