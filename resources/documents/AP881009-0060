(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Colossus and Muke have stoppedfighting, but they haven't started much else, zoo keepers saidSunday on the third day of a breeding project for the two oversizedgorillas.   ``They pretty much just sit on opposite sides of the yard,''said Lori Layfield of The Zoo in this Panhandle city. ``Theyhaven't had much contact.''   But she said keepers were pleased that there's been no repeat ofa first-day fight and that there were signs Colossus, a 600-poundmale on his first date, and Muke, a 250-pound female, are at leastinterested in each other.   ``He peeps at her and she peeps at him. If she moves out of hissight, he'll move around until he can see her, and she does thesame,'' Ms. Layfield said.   Overall, keepers who didn't know what to expect are ``thrilled''by the gorillas' first weekend together, she said.   Colossus, who has been in the zoo since March, and Muke,(pronounced moo-key) there since June, got their first look at eachother Friday.   Colossus, the largest gorilla in U.S. captivity, charged andflipped literally head over heels in an apparent attempt to injureMuke. He came away with a mouthful of fur and a 5-inch gash in hisneck delivered by Muke.   ``That was a good introduction,'' said Pat Quinn, the zoo'spresident and director. ``It was the first time he has touchedanother gorilla since he was an infant over 20 years ago.''   Both gorillas are age 22. Colossus stands at 6 feet, 2 inches.Muke is believed to be one of the larger female gorillas incaptivity.   Officials hope the breeding project, which will lastindefinitely, will shed new light on how gorillas mate incaptivity. Colossus' genes could be important because he is notrelated to any other zoo gorillas, Quinn said.   The two gorillas live in a new complex that includes airconditioning, sleeping quarters, an observation area and the playyard. They are herded into separate sleeping quarters, then backinto the common yard during the day.   Colossus was captured as an infant in the western lowlands ofCentral Africa in 1967. He came to Florida from Benson's AnimalPark in Hudson, N.H. Muke is on loan from the St. Louis Zoo.</TEXT></DOC>
