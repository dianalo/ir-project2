That,nevertheless, is what we now hear, in various rumblings abouta new atmosphere of caution discouraging to creative minds inthe industry.   Some series writers and producers, indeed, complained in arecent New York Times interview that they had begun to censorthemselves and avoid highly controversial themes, such ashomosexuality and abortion, because the networks have becomeincreasingly fearful of offending advertisers. All this, thecomplainants charged, has led to a general throttling oftheir creativity.</LP><TEXT>   This is not hard to believe; we are talking here, afterall, about writers schooled in the notion that creativity isall about extreme controversy and causes. In this world ofwriters, &quot;being creative&quot; means dealing with the latesthot-stuff social issues -- themes designed to raise socialconsciousness, effect our moral improvement and, not least,grab ratings.   It doesn't always work out that way, especially theratings part, as Barney Rosenzweig, executive producer of&quot;The Trials of Rosie O'Neill,&quot; can attest. Despite theapparently inexhaustible supply of social-justice messages itfired at us in incessant cannonades, this CBS series neverdid find an audience. Though the show is still in production,it now lies interred in its final time slot, awaiting itsend. The show's failure was evidently one of the things Mr.Rosenzweig had in mind when he complained recently of a newcensorship &quot;more ominous&quot; than any seen before. It's clearfrom the context of his remarks that he holds such censorshipresponsible for &quot;Rosie's&quot; ratings troubles and its frequentshifts in time slot.   &quot;The Trials of Rosie O'Neill,&quot; for those who still haven'twatched it, brings to a torpid and guilty America theescapades of a devoted legal-aid attorney who abandoned herupper-class heritage of comfort and selfishness to work forjustice and the poor, in between therapy sessions. Rosie, itappears, is also busy trying to find herself as a divorced,newly independent woman out doing battle in the workplace. Anew and daring theme if ever we heard one -- whatever willthey think of next?   The show does have one thing going for it, namely formerpolicewoman Sharon Gless in the title role. It was far fromenough as it turned out; viewers did not take to the showfrom day one, never did take to it, and they had plenty ofreasons. These included the show's high-decibel sermonizingand a supporting cast of not exactly fresh-minted characterswho work with Rosie in the legal defender's office. Theseinclude a dedicated and invariably angry black attorney, andan equally dedicated white attorney who is Jewish. We knowthis because he wears a skullcap, brings ruggelach to work,and wants Rosie to eat more.   Rosie and this rainbow coalition spend their days, itseems, exchanging homilies, ranting about the system andholding forth on the high importance of the principles towhich they are all devoted. They do this, that is, when notstuffing candy bars in their mouths, or gulping antacids toassuage the pain of ulcers earned in the ceaseless strugglefor justice. They are forever asking Rosie if she's allright, which she isn't most of the time, what with her mothertroubles and man troubles and, above all, her consciencetroubles.   In one episode, a Latino she successfully defended showsup at her house and makes a pass, won't leave, and generallylooks like a man about to cause serious problems. Rosiestarts to call the police and even begins to entertain thethought that maybe her client did commit the crime he wasaccused of. &quot;Why,&quot; snarls her fellow lawyer, &quot;because he's abrown man? Because he's bigger?&quot; This is enough to set Rosieto moaning that she's probably a hypocrite, and, on top ofthat, she figures she maybe sent the man the wrong signals.   In &quot;The Trials of Rosie O'Neill,&quot; everyone is guilty butthe accused. And if Rosie sometimes has doubts -- doubts thatarise out of her success in getting defendants, includingviolent criminals, off the hook and back onto the streets --her colleagues are always there to lend a hand or a homily.In one such instance, a colleague sagely advises her, &quot;Youcan't do the long jump without getting sand in your shorts.&quot;This line -- a fair reflection of the dialogue in &quot;Rosie&quot; --apparently so pleased the scriptwriters that they repeated itin the final scene.   Other arguments to the contrary, what undid &quot;Rosie&quot; wasits quality, or rather lack of it -- not a new and dangerouscensorship. Mr. Rosenzweig, to be sure, isn't the only onemaking the charges about a repressive atmosphere.Scriptwriters have been coming forward with stories aboutthis or that rejected script or character. As someoneexplained in the New York Times interview, writers andproducers want to explore issues freely. But exploring issuesfreely, it hardly needs saying, doesn't necessarily mean thatthe product will entertain. Most of the time, in fact,programs flaunting controversy and socially relevant themessucceed -- when they do -- in spite of the political content,not because of it.   The best case in point is &quot;Designing Women,&quot; whichdelivers politically progressive broadsides with someregularity, and took honors for being the first primetimeshow to deal with the Clarence Thomas hearings. &quot;Deal with&quot;may not be the most precise way, of course, to describe thecarrying on in this segment, which all but called a plague offire and brimstone down on Judge Thomas, the senators, andeveryone else who failed to credit Anita Hill's testimony. Itwas just what a viewer of the show would expect.   &quot;Designing Women&quot; nevertheless works. It works because itssilliness has character and other attractions to tide aviewer over the programmed attitudinizing. The appealing castis led by Dixie Carter, whose imperious style adds luster toall sorts of moralizing inanities that pop up in the script.The moral of this story is, of course, that if writers yearnto &quot;explore issues freely,&quot; the first issue to explore is howto put a decent show together. That way they won't get sandin their shorts.</TEXT></DOC>
