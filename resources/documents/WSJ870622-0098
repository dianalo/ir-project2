As a result, a court is taking money away from him to keep me on the straight and narrow.    Let me explain. In 1982, my son's Great-Uncle Frank died, leaving him $10,000. But Frank and the lawyer who drafted his will neglected to name a guardian for my son -- who was then eight years old. By the law of New York, where we live, a minor can inherit that much money only in the name of a guardian. Similar laws are on the books in numerous other states as well.    According to these state laws, parents aren't fit guardians. Possibly inspired by stories of child actors in Hollywood whose parents robbed them blind, many state legislatures long ago decided that all parents were out to cheat their offspring.    When Great-Uncle Frank's estate was distributed in 1983, in order to take possession of my son's $10,000 legacy, my wife and I were ordered by a judge, whom we have never met, to share custody of the money with a guardianship clerk at New York Surrogate's Court. Moreover, my wife and I cannot decide how our son's $10,000 will be invested, and he can't get the money until he turns 18. Until that time, we must obey the judge's investment decision, made without parental consultation.    Before the judge's orders came through, I was told that we would have to put the $10,000 into an account at a savings bank, which the judge would select. I asked: Could we invest the money in some stock instead? I was thinking of a blue chip at the time: Exxon.    Well, yes, I was told, we could invest the money in stock -- providing we gave the court $15,000 as a bond that we wouldn't invest the money in companies proposing to cure cancer with goat dander, or to manufacture glow-in-the-dark bowling balls, or to distribute pornographic computer programs. The $15,000 argument persuaded us to accept the judge's dictates.    So since 1983, the $10,000 has been sitting in the bank in a certificate of deposit that originally earned 10.2% and now earns 7.4%. To date, the $10,000 has grown by 44%. The price of Exxon, meanwhile, has risen more than 150% from its price on the day we opened the mandated savings account, and Exxon now pays a dividend of 10.9% on its purchase price of four years ago. (Exxon isn't unique: The Dow Jones Industrial Average -- made up of Exxon and 29 other dividend-paying, blue-chip stocks -- has approximately doubled.)    In addition, my son must pay income tax on all interest credited to his untouchable account -- and he must pay this tax with money from other sources that would otherwise be free to earn higher interest rates.    Moreover, the savings bank at which we were ordered to open the account has never sent us a correctly addressed statement. About once a year, my wife visits the bank in person, waiting each time for more than an hour to see an officer, in an attempt to correct the bank's latest error. Last year, the bank also computed the interest due on my son's account at less than the account's guaranteed rate.    We recently called the court to ask how difficult it would be to change banks. Well, a clerk told us, we'd need to hire a lawyer to make a petition -- but it probably wouldn't be worth the effort, he said, because every bank handling the court's joint custodial accounts seems to make similar mistakes. In other words, most of the court's &quot;safe&quot; investments are being managed by incompetents.    My son must wait five more years before he can collect his $10,000 -- which by then will probably have grown to more than $20,000 -- and, who knows, in the meantime, the stock market may crash while his insured bank account stays safe. So what am I griping about?    Aside from the fact that my son could have done better financially so far -- and I think could do better in the future -- what frosts me is the state's presumption that I am guilty of wanting to misappropriate or fritter away my son's money.    New York's law -- in common with statutes in many other states -- presumes guilt, which not only shows contempt for me and every other well-meaning parent but certainly seems unconstitutional. Americans, I was taught, are presumed innocent until proven guilty. That may be true in most cases. Sometimes it isn't, I've learned, for parents who want only the financial best for their children.    ---   Mr. Weil is a financial columnist for the New York Post and the San Antonio Light. </TEXT></DOC>
