Welcome at New Orleans Airport</HEAD><BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eduardo Castellou-Vogel whipped up the troopsone more time.   ``We're party animals! Right?'' he yelled.   ``Right!'' the 50 greeters lined up at gate 15-D in the NewOrleans Airport screamed back.   ``What did you say?''   ``Right!'' they yelled even louder.   Delta Flight 4082 from San Francisco had not even finishedrolling up to the gate when Castellou-Vogel started his chargesclapping.   ``Play some music,'' he shouted to the Onward Brass Band.``Let's boogie!''   The plangent sounds reached the passengers even before they madetheir way up the ramp and caught sight of the cheering, clapping,sign-waving throng decked out in red, white and blue to greet them.   The exuberant cheers grew even louder for those who arrived inthis reknowned party town sporting Republican paraphernalia, likethe woman who deplaned from Nashville with two stuffed elephantsgrazing atop her straw hat.   ``It's all part of our effort to let people know New Orleans isa friendly city and that we want them here,'' said ToddVillarrubia, assistant director of airport operations for theRepublican National Convention.   Volunteer greeters, 700 of them, were trained to give a rousingwelcome to the delegates, politicians, V.I.P.s, and assorted GOPconventioneers arriving at New Orleans.   The greeters began patrolling the two airport concourses Aug. 5and will keep rolling out the red carpet through Aug. 20.   From 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., they cheer, clap, call out greetings andblow kisses at those arriving. Although they're there to greetthose attending the Republican National Convention, everyone on theplane gets the same welcome.   ``It was wonderful,'' said Mary Setar of Los Angeles, whosehusband came to play in a convention orchestra. ``I didn't knowwhat to think. I looked around thinking someone famous must bearriving, but they were doing it for all of us. I think itsmarvelous, just the kind of thing you expect from New Orleans.''   Jonathan Price, a delegate from Monterey, Calif., agreed.   ``It's absolutely wonderful. You come off the plane after a longtrip and sometihing like this really pumps you up.''   For the greeters, seeing the reaction of the people arriving isjust part of the fun.   ``It's kind of like a surprise birthday party,'' said AmieJohnson, 13, as she prepared to meet another plane. ``I'm hoping tosee someone famous before we finish, but I greet everyone the sameway, even if they're not a celebrity.''   In fact, the greeters said Saturday, spotting the realcelebrities arriving for the convention is tough.   ``We saw Maria Shriver today. She had on big sunglasses, but myfriend recognised her,'' Fran Moorman said.   Jane Ray is convinced that one television anchorman slipped pastincognito.   ``Dan Rather wore a disguise when he came through,'' the greetersaid. ``I talked to some people who saw him. They said he had on afalse moustache, dark glasses and a baseball cap.''</TEXT></DOC>
