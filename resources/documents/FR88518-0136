Mr. President, it is time Congress became serious about theloud and clear message delivered by the stock market crash way back inOctober last year. In the long months that have followed, Congress hasfailed to act. Shortly after Black Monday, President Reagan commissionedformer Senator Nicholas Brady to report with<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>in<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> 60 days on the crash and recommend what, if anything,the Government should do about it. Senator Brady quickly organized a topflight group of experts. The Brady <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission made a report including a series of recommendationsfor action. That report has been highly praised by security market experts.Senator Brady strongly emphasized the urgency of the situation. He calledfor prompt action. In fact, he told our <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>co<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mmittee, ``There's a pistol pointed at our head andit's loaded.'' The Senate Banking <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommittee began hearings on the Brady report a fewdays after the report became available last January. The report was precededby a similar report commissioned by the New York Stock Exchange and directedby former Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach. The Katzenbach <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>re<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>port strongly recommended action very similar tothe Brady <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>re<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>port proposals. The SEC also weighed in with an extra<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rdinarily detailed and thoughtful report. Again,the recommended action was similar to the Brady recommendations. A few days after receiving these reports, this Senator, as chairman ofthe Banking Committee, requested the Chairm<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n of SEC, the Federal Reserve Board, and the CommodityFutures Trading Commission to give the committee specific and detailedrecommendations for legislative enactment by March 4. Since these are independentagencies, I specifically requested the chairmen of the agencies to reportdirectly to the committee without clearing with the administration. Thechairm<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n assured me that their independent status wouldnot require that they report to the administration, and they would reportto the committee. In late February, these regulators asked for more time.In mid-March, the administration requested that the regulators report firstto the President. When the regulators did testify before our <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommittee in late March, they made no significantlegislative recommendations. By that time, the committee had the benefit of the Brady Report, the KatzenbachReport, the SEC Report<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and 8 days of testimony on action with respect tothe securities market from the Federal Reserve Board, the SEC, the CFT,and a series of witnesses representing the country's investors, municipalities,counties, corporations, and others who issue securities. We also heardfrom spokesmen for the securities industry and other interested parties.On the basis of this testimony, the staff of our <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommittee drafted the Intermarket Coordination Actof 1988. It has been introduced by 10 Senators, 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans.We designed this bill to generally reflect the recommendations of the Brady<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>co<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mmission and the other expert commissions that hadstudied the problem.This bill recognizes that there is one American security market. It isregulated by three separate and distinct regulatory agencies. The threeagencies have applied different and conflicting regulations, sharply differentmargin requirements, different settlement, and different information systems.At present, there is no mechanism for coordinating or harmonizing theseclashing differences. Trading on the New York Stock Exchange and the SecurityFutures Exchanges in Chicago are profoundly and constantly interrelated.Mr. President, because of the far lower margin requirements on the securityfutures market in Chicago and because the security indices available fortrading on that market permit traders, especially very big traders, tocheaply buy effective ``insurance'' by taking offsetting positions in optionsand futures, and, finally, because a relatively small transaction can movethe entire market, our securities markets have become far more volatilethan ever before. That volatility has had two extremely unfortunate effects.First, the overwhelming majority of investors, the so-called small or ``outside''investors, feel that the game is rigged against the<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>m<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> because of the advantage of a few enormous institutionalinvestors. As a consequence, studies have documented the fact that manyinvestors have left the country's securities markets since the Octobercrash.An even more serious consequence of this volatility has been the spectacularreduction in equity issues by American corporations. First-time issuesin the first 4 months after the October crash fell a sickening 80 percentcompared with the 4 months before Black Monday. Reissues fell even moresharply, in fact, by more than 90 percent.Mr. President, at a time when excessive business debt and increasinglythinner equity is a serious national economic problem, this retreat fromequity financing by American business is potentially a very serious development.Our corporations are becoming increasingly more fragile. The next recessionis likely to have severe consequences on heavily leveraged businesses thatcan become insolvent in a few months after revenues fall, because theirinterest burden is so heavy. The stability and market confidence this legislationwould restore is especially critical in view of the skyrocketing businessdebt in this country.Here's what the bill does: It creates a commission to be chaired by theChairman of the Federal Reserve Board. The Commission would also includethe Chairman of SEC and the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Corporation.The bill directs this coordinating committee to harmonize margin requirementsacross market<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>laces, improve and coordinate clearing and settlementsystems. It also calls on the coordinating committee to provide informationsystems adequate for market surveillance and enforcement, including thetime of each trade and the name of the ultimate customer. The bill directsthe committee to coordinate planning for market emergencies. It also prohibitsintermarket frontrunning. The bill also calls on the committee to initiatediscussions with regulators of financial institutions and markets in majorfinancial centers throughout the world.On May 11, the committee heard testimony from six of the country's outstandingexperts on this country's securities markets. The witnesses included DonaldRegan, former Secretary of the Treasury and former CEO of Merrill Lynch;George Ball, chairman of the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>b<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>oard of Prudential Bache; Charles Schwab, chairmanand CEO of Charles Schwab; Brean Murray, CEO of Murray, Foster Securities;Michael Reilly, vice president for investor relations of Reuters; and JamesNeedham, former SEC commissioner. In general, the testimony enthusiasticallyfavored the proposed intermarket coordination act and called for promptcongressional action.[S17MY8-12]{S5980}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F<CODE-213>5</CODE-213></ITAG>[S17MY8-13]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5980}<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>PLANT CLOS<ITAG tagnum="81">PLANT CLOSINGS<CODE-213>0</CODE-213></ITAG>[S17MY8-14]{S5980}SANFORDMr. SANFORD. Mr. Pres<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>id<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ent, the President on Saturday declared that advancenotice to working men and women of the closing of their plant, their workplace,their means of livelihood is something that unions, not <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>G<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>overnment, should arrange. This will not go downwell in North Carolina. We have a right to work law, a requirement thata worker does not have to join a union. Now the President declares_don'trely on your <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>G<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>overnment to require fair play; call on your union.That is not the way we have been doing it in North Carolina.Plant closing<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> without notice have been most abused by the hostiletakeover sharks, who generally also declare union contracts abrogated.We know that there are certain protections that the worker needs. Minimumwages and maximum hours, hazardous substances in the workplace, unemploymentcompensation, the prevention of exploitation of child labor, and othersimilar matters must be handled by public legislation. We do not rely onunions alone to provide fair play for the worker.The plain fact is that all work<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ing<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> men and women are entitled to adequate notice thattheir place of livelihood is to be abolished. It serves the public interestalso, because advance planning reduces unemployment and permits time forour retraining and relocation programs to work.The trade bill, which the President will veto because of the plant closingnotice provision, is a modest proposal. No one wi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>th<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> less than 100 employees is covered. A business emergencyexcuses compliance. The provision, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>as<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> an amendment to the retraining section of the tradebill, cleared the Senate 60 to 40, so it is not one-sided or partisan.We need a trade bill. Our unrestrained world competition is eating us up.It is a lame excuse to veto th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>is<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> bill because the President wants to leave to theunions the welfare of North Carolina, and all other, workers.[S17MY8-15]{S5980}F   <ITAG tagnum="66">F   </ITAG>[S17MY8-16]{S5980}NATIONAL D<ITAG tagnum="81">NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT   </ITAG>The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the problem of unauthorized appropriations hasbeen growing over the years.In 1982, there were only $730 million of unauthorized appropriations. Lastyear there was $7.25 billion. That is a tenfold increase in unauthorizedappropriations.Last year, in addition, the appropriations conference explicitly reversedseveral key policy decisions adopted by the authorization conference. Iwill not go into the examples of that this morning.We have had a very close relationship with our Appropriations Committeeunder Senator <T4>Stennis. </T4>We have worked very closely together. Our staffs haveworked very closely together. We have worked with Senator <T4>Johnston. </T4>We have worked with Senator <T4>Stevens. </T4>We have worked with Senator <T4>Hatfield.</T4>But the problem usually occurs in conference. In conference we have twodifferent committees on authorizations, one from the House and one fromthe Senate. When we get to the appropriations conference there are twoother committees. And we end up having some serious conflicts that haveeroded the authorization process.So, we have a couple of amendments in this bill that deal with the problem,that is, section 903 and section 904. The Armed Services Committee undertook these modifications as part of oureffort to get the overall coordination between authorizations and appropriationsin better order. That is to say that we do have a section in this billthat says that appropriations which are not authorized will require subsequentauthorization before the moneys can be expended. We have worked carefully with the Appropriations Committee in trying toavoid a fight on this on the floor because we believe a lot of this problemis beyond our control and their control. They find themselves in conferencewith the House. The House has many different provisions and sometimes inan effort to compromise toward the end of the session the whole questionof what is authorized gets lost in the shuffle. Because of that we have taken the position, and the Secretary of Defensehas adhered to this position, that funds which have not been authorizedshould not be expended by the Department of Defense, even appropriated,until such time as the authorizing committees agree to those. We have now agreed to about 98 percent of those that were appropriatedlast year. We have rejected in this bill about 2 percent of those. So we have agreed on the substance with the appropriators on most of theseitems. But like most authorizing committees, we find ourselves in a position_wehave never been in a position as an authorizing committee that we werea floor; that is to say, the appropriators have always been able to cutthe authorization. And that is as it should be. They should be able tocut the authorization because they have to make the final money judgment.But now, if we are not a ceiling either_in other words, if they cannotonly go under our authorization, if they can also go over it, you are nota ceiling and you are not a floor. If you are not either one, you haveto ask yourselves as an authorizing committee what are you, and that isthe question we are asking when we put in sections 903 and 904 that madeexplicit what has been a practice, and that is that unauthorized appropriationsshould not be expended until authorized. Now, the appropriators have objected to these two sections, and we haveworked very carefully with them to change those sections. We are deletingone section by this amendment, but we have a written agreement worked outbetween the authorizers and the appropriators that basically continuesthe accommodation we have had for the last 2 years; that is to say, thechairman of the committee and the ranking subcommittee chairman and rankingmember of the Subcommittee on Defense will be able to attend our meetings,will be able to suggest, on behalf of a majority of their committee, anyamendments. And we will have a reciprocal right before the appropriatingcommittee. In addition to that, we have an agreement which says that the AppropriationsCommittee agrees not to appropriate more than is authorized unless theamount so appropriated is explicitly made subject to authorization. Inother words, rather than doing this by law, the appropriators are agreeingto put that kind of provision in their bill. We are not rigid about this.We know that there are differences between line items and accounts. Weknow there are a lot of adjustments that have to be made toward the endof the year on financing matters. We for our part, are going to try to give more flexibility in our billto the appropriators and we hope for their part they will respect the authorizationexcept where absolutely necessary to make changes due to financing changesin matters that we could not have anticipated. In other words, we feelthe authorizing committees make the policy decision, by and large, andthe appropriators make an awful lot of the financial decisions and financialadjustments as far as the military is concerned. [S17MY8-47]{S5982}STENNISMr. STENNIS. Will the Senator yield? [S17MY8-48]{S5982}NUNNMr. NUNN. I am glad to yield to the Senator. [S17MY8-49]{S5982}STENNISMr. STENNIS. Mr. President, I have been present here and heard the Senator'sstatement. On the whole, I agree with the purposes of his statement aswell as the content, even though there may be a few points we may disagreeon. I reserve, as chairman, whatever power or right it takes to take thatposition, if necessary. But, the general purpose, we are together on it and it is something thatmust be done. Something along this line must be done. It is already servinga very good purpose indeed. I endorse the position of the Senator and his coworkers wholeheartedly,reserving only the right to argue things out on the merits. I thank the Senator. [S17MY8-50]{S5982}NUNNMr. NUNN. I thank the chairman and my good friend from Mississippi. I believehe stated it exactly correct. We have worked this out in good faith. Theonly other element of this agreement that I think we ought to make clearis that so many times if we have a staff representative in the conferencetoward the end of the session, it would be of great help. We hope thatwe will be able to, and we believe we have an agreement now to, have astaff representative of our committee aware of what is going in the appropriationsconference. And we will certainly reciprocate by having a staff memberor whatever number members you would like in our conference. Mr. President, I can say that maybe we are making real progress here forone reason. First, the substance, and second because I understand the HouseAppropriations Committee and the House Armed Services Committee have agreedon almost identical language now, and that is the key. Because it doesnot do a lot of good, in the final analysis, for the two Senate committeesto be in agreement, which we largely have been, and the House committeesto be out of sync and then that affects both of the conference outcomes.Mr. President, I know the Senator from <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Virg<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>inia would like to be heard on this point.

Without objection, it is so ordered.[S17MY8-64]{S5983}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman has adequately statedthe case. For the past several years, this Senator, the Senator from Alaska,and, indeed, Senator <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Tow<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>er and Senator <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Gol<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>dwater and others, have made this process work primarilybecause of the good faith and trust amongst us. I think it is time nowthat we try and reduce it more and more to writing the essential natureand the relevance of the two committees, the Armed Services Committee inits authorization capacity and the Appropriations Committee in its capacity.I do hope in the years to come we will see less problem in this area andI think this agreement is a step forward.[S17MY8-65]{S5983}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Louisiana on the floor.We do not have but about 2 minutes before the rollcall vote that has beenordered, but the Senator from Louisiana would be, I am sure, interestedin knowing that we have an amendment at the desk_it has not been approvedyet_to change section 903 and to delete section 904 pursuant to our agreement.I just put into the <T4>Record</T4> the written agreement that we have entered between theappropriations and authorizing committees and expressed the hope that wecan continue to make progress to coordinate our activities, particularlyin light of the fact that the House committees have now gotten the samekind of agreement, and that may put us much more in sync with the Houseside.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?[S17MY8-66]{S5983}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have just received from the Senator from Alaskathat he is in agreement with this.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?[S17MY8-67]{S5983}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I am very pleased that this agreement hasbeen filed, even though, in written form, it does not dot every ``i'' andcross every ``t.'' And, indeed, it cannot do so, because, in the finalanalysis, the proper relationship between the Appropriations Committeeand the Armed Services Committee_indeed, between the Appropriations Committeeand any authorizing committee_rests upon the good faith and trust betweenthe numbers. Because there will always be situations in which, for example,the Armed Services Committee bill is not in final form, although its policyis expressed, if that situation might not be covered by the exact wordsof the written agreement.But I think what they have agreed to here is not only the text, the writtenword, but the spirit of cooperation. I think the problem has never reallybeen as much between the Senate Armed Services Committee and the AppropriationsCommittee as perhaps between the Senate Armed Services Committee and theHouse Appropriations Committee.We will certainly also try to play a role to avoid conflicts, not onlywithin the Senate, but to seek to clear the way so that they will not arisewith the House, either.I really do not anticipate any major differences. The Armed Services Committee,I do not think, is going to try to hold the Senate to individual line itemswith micromanagement. And, indeed, the written agreement does not appear,at le<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ast<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to me, to cover those line items, but certainlyit does on the broad policy implication. And, with respect to those categories,I think we will have no difficulty at all in marching together on a commonpolicy direction as set by the Armed Services Committee.(Mr. SHELBY assumed the chair.)[S17MY8-68]{S5984}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Louisiana. He has stated,I think, the agreement very well, I would say, with one slight caveat.It is true that we do not try to control the line items unless the lineitem is something we really focused on with a great deal of policy deliberationand, in that case, we put it in the bill.Now that, I think, is easy to read. It is not a matter of controlling allof them, but there are some of them that become very important as policymatters. But normally what we would have in terms of relationship is theaccount level is what we would normally be dealing with. And when we dofocus on a policy matter at a line item level_for instance, the cancellationof an aircraft. If the committee spends 3 months looking at aircraft andwe finally decide to cancel one, and we put it in the line item, then thatbecomes a very serious policy matter. And I would hope the AppropriationsCommittee understands that.So we do have to work in general agreement here. We cannot cross every``t'' and dot every ``i.'' The Senator is right about that.[S17MY8-69]{S5984}JOHNSTONMr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I appreciate that comment. We could not goso far, for example, as to have this whole bill a line item, because thenyou would have the anomalous situation of the Appropriations Committeenot being able to reduce appropriations because of the budget summit, notbeing able to increase them because of the ceiling set on every line item,and then having only the option of saying yes. We could not even say no.[S17MY8-70]{S5984}NUNNMr. NUNN. The Senator is correct. We certainly do not intend to deal withevery line item, nor would we advocate that as the policy. It would onlybe those that we felt are enormously important policy decisions.Mr. President, I hope we can now adopt the amendment.[S17MY8-71]{S5984}WARNERMr. WARNER. I at some point reserve the right to propose one more amendment.It is on the list.[S17MY8-72]{S5984}NUNNMr. NUNN. You have the right. Let us see if we can get this one adoptedhere.[S17MY8-73]{S5984}WILSONMr. WILSON. Mr. President, we have adopted an amendment that sought toreconcile appropriated but unauthorized items having to do with our militaryspending. The amendment we adopted omitted to include an item for continuedP-3C production.In my judgment, that omission is in error, I think a serious error, butI am not going to take the time now either to offer an amendment, becauseit is clear that it would not be successful, nor am I going to rehash thearguments.However, I will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the <T4>Record </T4>a letter addressed to Senator <T4>Nunn</T4>, with copies to all of us, from the International Associationof Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which I think makes compelling argumentsfor the inclusion of P-3C procurement in this authorization bill. I wishwe had taken that action. I think that at some time in the future, we willfind ourselves compelled to do so.The so-called LRAACA, the advanced aircraft the Navy is seeking, is a luxuryI do not <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hink we can afford, but the arguments are well statedin this letter.I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the <T4>Record.</T4>There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the <T4>Record</T4>, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="61">International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="53">Washington, DC, May 16, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="54">Hon. </ITAG><T4>Sam Nunn, </T4><ITAG tagnum="55">U.S. Senate, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="55">Washington, DC. </ITAG>[S17MY8-74]{S5984}<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Dear Senator: </T4>I and my delegates from the International Associationof Machinists have urgently sought to meet with you since last Thursdayto voice our concern over the termination of the P-3C production line.We have been advised by everybody that your Committee, the Committee onArmed Services, has recommended to deny obligation authority for the sixP-3C aircraft that were approved by both the House and Senate in the FY1988 Appropriations Continuing Resolution. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Staff people have talked to us and told us that this action was takenbecause the Navy had not requested P-3C aircraft in F<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> 1988 and FY 1989 due to the pending start of thefuture Long Range Air ASW Capable Aircraft (LRAACA), and that potentialforeign sales will keep the line open. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Senator Nunn, all those people told us and I now feel that the Committeemay not have considered some very new and very recent information concerningthe P-3C program and the new LRAACA program which you should now consider.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>N<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>avy did not request P-3C procurement in FY 1988 becausewhen the FY 1988/FY 1989 budget was being developed by the Navy they hada plan to have industry compete for a P-3D program which would result inthe initial production of 125 aircraft in FY 1989 and therefore no aircraftwere requested in FY 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The P-3D (P-3G) competition was dropped by the Navy when no otherAerospace company indicated that they would compete against Lockheed.

So I want to give timeto the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, the chairman of the ForeignRelations Committee.I would j<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>us<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t say very briefly there is nothing very sensationala<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>bo<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ut this amendment. I<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. It simply putsus on record one way or the other as far as dismissing the indictmentsthat are now pending in the State of Florida against General Noriega.My view is that we should not dismiss the indictments. I am not certainwhat the administration's view is. I know it is a very difficult negotiationthey are involved in. But it seems to me with all we have been talkingabout the last few days, the last few months, the polls reveal concernabout drugs, international drug trafficking; that we now have brought theArmy into it, the Air Force, the Navy; that symbolically we are makinga mistake if in fact the indictments against Noriega are dismissed.Those who brought the indictments did so after careful study, and a lotof work. Maybe he will never be brought to trial. But it seems to me thatthe indictments should stand. I would hope that by passing this amendmentwe would send a clear signal, a positive signal, to the administrationthat as far as the Senate is concerned we do not believe that is appropriateaction to take in view of the drug problem we face in America today. Thatis all it does. It does not bind anybody. It is a sense<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>of<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Senate. Some may agree, and some may disagree.I know that. Negotiations are difficult. I know other things have, suchas economic sanctions, been tried. I know other things have been triedthat have not worked. Noriega is still there.But I would hope that we can at least let the American people know, thereal people, that this body does not believe we ought to dismiss criminalproceedings against a man who has been trafficking in drugs, making millionsand millions of dollars, spreading misery across America to our childrenand our grandchildren. That is the only purpose of the amendment. I mustsay the White House is opposed to it.[S17MY8-128]{S5986}D'AMATOMr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.[S17MY8-129]{S5986}D'AMATOMr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, as I indicated last evening, I strongly supportand am pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator <T4>Dole's</T4> resolution.Mr. President, one thing I am sure of is that Ronald Reagan has and alwaysdoes listen to the voice of the people of America. I hope they take thisopportunity to call the White House. Let the President know what they thinkabout this deal that is being concocted that has not been accepted yetby Noriega, which has been called by some, plea-bargaining. I choose andhave characterized it as our pleading and Noriega's bargaining.Senator <T4>Dole</T4> rightfully characterized it as a legal golden parachute forNoriega, and to anyone who suggests that it is good that we drop theseindictments because Noriega is leaving power, I would suggest to you thatis totally inaccurate. It is wrong. It is a misstatement of the facts.He may be leaving, and only temporarily, but the power that he has willcontinue as it relates to the PDF, the Panama Defense Forces. He pickshis successor. He will continue to rule. He is allowed to continue thePresident of his choice in office until new elections.If anyone really thinks that those elections are going to be any fairerthan any of the other elections that they have had in Panama, they aremistaken.Mr. President, this concoction that comes because there are those in theadministration, particularly in the Defense Department, who are comingto set policy as opposed to carrying out policy, and who have opposed strongmeasures that have been urged in the past by the State Department. Thissends a terrible message, the wrong message at a time when we are attemptingto say we are serious as it relates to dealing with the international drugtraffickers. What do we say as it relates to the defendants who are chargedwith drug crimes here in this country? There would not be one of them whowould not be eager to have such an incredible deal.No, Mr. President, it is important that we send a message clearly to theadministration. Let the American people call the White House, and let themknow because what they would be saying is we are opposed to a deal thatdoes everything but give Manuel Noriega a testimonial. That is the onlything we have not suggested yet, a testimonial dinner as drug dealer ofthe decade. That is all we have dropped out because that is exactly whatthis proposal which has been bandied about would be conferring on him.The Latin American dictators and drug dealers can sit back and bask inglory and laugh at the United States at our ineptitude, and at our incompetence.It is inconceivable that we would want to loan even the indicia of supportto this agreement. I hope we will support this resolution overwhelmingly.[S17MY8-130]{S5987}WILSONMr. WILSON and Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.[S17MY8-131]{S5987}PELLMr. PELL. Mr. President, I realize the appeal of this amendment. My concernis that it narrows the options available to the administration by interveningin the negotiations at this time. That is always a questionable point.By saying we cannot use one of the inducements, the dropping of the indictmentsonly strengthens the h<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>an<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d of those in the administration who are advocatingother methods of persuasion, including conceivably the use of force. Sothere is a very good reason to be concerned about the amendment and narrowingthe options.However, recognizing the fact the Senate is not enthusiastic about theway the administration is conducting negotiations with Noriega, and thatthere is no assurance that Noriega will be giving up power in exchangefor the dropping of the indictment; recognizing that it is a sense-of-the-Senateresolution; and recognizing that some sort of message should be sent alongthese lines, I know that speaking from my viewpoint from the Foreign RelationsCommittee I will support the amendment.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.[S17MY8-132]{S5987}WILSONMr. WILSON. Thank you, Mr. President.Mr. President, that is an example of, I think, being a little too<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>clever by<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>half.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Our British friends use that phrase often when theyare commenting on someone who has made an effort to do something in a fashionso sophisticated that in fact he loses sight of the basic fundamental.In this case, there is a principle. The principle is that indictments seekto bring people to justice after not a careless or casual, but after aconcerted and fair effort to determine whether or not they should standtrail. All the evidence in this instance indicates that the man that weare speaking of not only deserves to stand trail, but that he is perhapsescaping the kind of scrutiny for past misdeeds for which he is a legendthroughout this hemisphere.For us to now publicly engage in a deal whereby he is relieved of any apprehensionth<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t he might come to justice for what he has done sendsa very clear and a very wrong message to all the world who are watching.It says that we will be selective in our out<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ra<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e, that when we take to task drug producing nationsand in fact vote <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>disapprove their certification as being in full cooperationunder the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, that they still have hope if theyare big enough, well-placed enough, if they are clever enough, to holdout for a very good bargin that in fact they may escape justice.Mr. President, that is a very dangerous signal to send. The American peoplewill not be mystified by it.

We will not simply ignore theabundance of evidence that cries out for legal process of the kind thathas resulted here in criminal indictments against this dictator.

Mr. President, I should like to state this Senator's understandingof the procedure leading up to this moment and the content of the amendment.As to procedure: Last night, it was this Senator's understanding that theamendment had been cleared at the staff level. At some point_and that wasperfectly within the rights of all Senators_there was an objection lodged.Consequently, it was incumbent upon the Senator from Virginia to bringup the amendment and ask for appropriate debate this morning, and thenthe resolution of the amendment by rollcall vote, which I now seek Mr.President. I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?There is not a sufficient second.[S17MY8-140]{S5988}WARNERMr. WARNER. I beg the Chair's pardon?The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there as sufficient second?There is a sufficient second.The yeas and nays were ordered.[S17MY8-141]{S5988}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, as to the amendment itself: The first threeparagraphs of the amendment, which I will shortly read, are drawn verbatimfrom the Senate Armed Services Committee INF report. The first paragraph:[S17MY8-142]{S5988}<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Notwithstanding the critical need for conventional force improvements,the security of the NATO Alliance will rely on modern and credible nuclearweapons, with a goal of raising the nuclear threshold.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The modernization of NATO's theater nuclear capabilities is acontinuing process, stemming from NATO's 1983 Montebello decision to reducethe European nuclear stockpile while taking steps to insure that the remainingnuclear weapons are responsive, survivable and effective.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Theater nuclear modernization programs, which enjoyed a high priorityfor NATO before the INF Treaty, are no less important for the post-INFperiod.</ITAG>All those statements were made by the Senate Armed Services Committee inconjunction with its report on the INF. As a matter of fact, throughoutthe hearing held by the Armed Services Committee on the INF, time and timeagain these three points were made, almost without exception, by all thewitnesses.The fourth statement is a statement of fact, and I read it:[S17MY8-143]{S5988}<ITAG tagnum="21">(4) NATO Ministers, meeting most recently at the Nuclear PlanningGroup (NPG), reaffirmed their endorsement of U.S. development of a follow-onto Lance (FOTL) with a view toward an eventual decision on deployment.</ITAG>The purpose of this amendment is to send a clear message that we shouldnot give allies the impression that Congress is not supporting this theaternuclear force modernization.The next sentence says, ``Therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that,''and then the following paragraph, again, is taken directly from the ArmedServices Committee INF report:[S17MY8-144]{S5988}<ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore it is the sense of the Senate that:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Modernization of NATO's theater nuclear capabilities followingratification of the INF Treaty is essential to the deterrence strategyof the Alliance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Continued U.S. modernization of its threater nuclear capabilitiesshould be undertaken in close consultation with our NATO Allies.</ITAG>Again, two proposals testified to by almost every witness who came beforeour committee, and then incorporated in our report.Now the third and last paragraph of the amendment reads as follows:[S17MY8-145]{S5988}<ITAG tagnum="21">The United States should proceed with ongoing activities for satisfyingthe identified Alliance requirement for a follow-on to Lance. Existinglegislation pertaining to the use of the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS)for the follow-on to Lance should not be interpreted so as to exclude theATACMS from the missile selection process should the Multiple Launch RocketSystem (MLRS) be among the delivery systems selected in the Army Cost andOperational Effectiveness Analysis (COEA).</ITAG>The amendment has been carefully drawn so that it does not, and I repeat,not in any way undermine the existing legislation that limits the development,testing, and production of ATACMS as a follow-on to Lance.I will now refer to the existing legislation.In the authorization bill last year:[S17MY8-146]{S5988}SEC. 258. <ITAG tagnum="72">SEC. 258.

The amendment does put theSenate on record as we should be on record as supporting necessary modificationof theater nuclear system<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> in close consultation with our allies.The amendment makes it clear it is not the intent of the legislation toexclude consideration of the ATACMS as a candidate missile for a follow-onto Lance.Now, Mr. President, that is as succinct and as clear as I can state thepurpose of this amendment. I urge its adoption. I anticipate that otherswill be addressing this issue momentarily.Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.[S17MY8-147]{S5988}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for thequorum call be rescinded.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.[S17MY8-148]{S5988}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Warner amendment.[S17MY8-149]{S5988}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I have been advised by the Defense Departmentthat the Army has determined that the existing legislation prohibitinga nuclear ATACMS would preclude including the ATACMS as a candidate forconsideration during the missile selection process for the multiple launchrocket system known as the MLRS should the MLRS be among the delivery systemsselected for evaluation as a candidate for the nuclear follow-on to theLance <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>P<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rogram.The distinguished ranking member of the committee, Senator <T4>Warner,</T4> had hoped to clear an amendment that would have statedor would state_and that is what we have here before us now_the sense ofthe Senate that the ATACMS could be considered notwithstanding the existinglegislative prohibition.This amendment would not, however, repeal the legislative restriction onATACMS nor will it constitute an authority to enter into any development,testing or production of a nuclear ATACMS, as I understand it.I must advise my colleague that I have not been able to clear this amendmenton our side, and I hope, therefore, that perhaps the Senator would considernot insisting on a vote but, of course, that is his right.We are now in a late stage of the debate. This is a very important issue.I am sure that Senator <T4>Kennedy</T4> for one and probably others will want to be heard on this.In addition, there are still questions in my mind both as to the validityof the Army's reading of the law_I am not sure they are reading it correctly,although it is probably a close call_and the larger policy question ofwhether we would want to encourage the ATACMS to be considered during themissile selection process if we have no intent of lifting the restrictionslater on. In other words, what does it do to the process if we say in thesense of the Senate go ahead, fellows, and they go ahead and put it incompetition? We still have the prohibition on the record. It then is selected.What does it do to the other candidates in terms of o<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>bs<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>curing the process? That is one question.What I would like to suggest to my colleagues is that we have the committeelook into these questions and have a hearing on the question, and we coulddo that at an early date. I do not mind scheduling that hearing soon. Wehave a number of other small bills that will be going through. I wouldlike very much, if we do decide to make a change in this, to probably doit in the law rather than in the sense of the Senate, and I will explainthat in a moment. We also would have a chance for the committee to be heard.I think we would have a much better chance of taking corrective action.Let me make one other point. So, really, question No. 1 is<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>W<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hat is the status of the compet<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>it<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ion<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>?<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> If they go forward with this system, we still keepthe preclusion in law relating to its nuclear use but encourage them togo forward and make it a candidate. And if then it wins, what does it doto the other candidates for competition? That is one question.The other question I would have on the Senator's amendment would declareexisting legislation pertaining to the use of the Army tactical missilessystem for the follow-on Lance should not be interpreted so as to excludethe ATACMS from the missile selection process should the MLRS be amongthe delivery systems selected in the Army's cost and operational effectivenessanalysis?Mr. President, the other point I would make is that I have not studiedthis in great detail. I have a hard time seeing how a sense-of-the-Senateresolution could change the legislative history of a piece of legislationthat has already passed. In other words, we are here on the floor, thetwo of us. We are talking about a sense of the Senate and even if the Senatepasses this sense<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>of<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Senate does that really affect the legislative historyof a provision that has been in law for 3 years? This has been in the lawfor 3 or 4 years. We made an adjustment last year.So, I am afraid <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>we <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>are going to have a vote on this. The Senator mayprevail. I do not know how the vote will come out. I just do not see howa sense-of-the-Senate resolution can affect the legislative intent of alaw on the books where the House of Representatives is not a part of thisand with the law already on the books.Maybe the Senator could explain that to me. In other words, I am afraidwe are going to end up getting a vote here that is going to show a verydivided question on this question of the nuclear role for ATACMS, and thenwe will not have solved anything even if it prevails.Those are my two essential questions.Finally, I would say that I would assure the Senator that whether thisamendment is agreed to <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>or <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>not I will cooperate with him in every way in seeingthat we have an early hearing on this question. This is a substantive issue.It is not a question of being against or for the ATACMS. I am very muchin favor of ATACMS but the ATACMS was a program that was sold to the Congresson the basis of developing the accuracy with ou<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> short-range missile systems that would begin tosubstitute those systems for the short-range nuclear systems that we allknow in too many cases would hit on the soil we are sworn to defend.So the idea was to develop a conventional program to focus the attentionon the conventional program to make it very accurate and to begin to giveus the capability of moving away from this early use of weapons that haveextremely short range and largely would have to hit the NATO theater. Itis very hard to convince the Europeans that you are defending them if yourbasing systems cannot kill beyond their border.It would be like stationing, basically, several missiles in Virginia designedto protect against an invasion from the north, but none of the weaponscan get outside of Virginia. I imagine the Senator from Virginia wouldhave a hard time explaining how you can defend Virginia by exploding nuclearweapons on Virginia's soil. That is what we are facing in NATO and thatis what we are going to be debating some in the INF Treaty.That is why we wanted an ATACMS system that would be conventional, notnuclear. That is why, at the very best, I think this question is prematurenow. I am just not sure that the Senator's motive, which is a good motivein solving this, is something to be fulfilled even if it passes.So I raise those objections.[S17MY8-150]{S5989}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, in replying to my distinguished friend_and Iam wondering if he might remain wired up so we can have a little colloquy.[S17MY8-151]{S5989}NUNNMr. NUNN. Yes.[S17MY8-152]{S5989}WARNERMr. WARNER. We had the privilege, and indeed the pleasure of accompanyingthe majority leader_indeed, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee,the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, yourself, and I_through a tripto Europe in which we visited with the heads of state of the governmentsof five nations. At those meetings, it was my impression that the Senatorfro<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>m<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Georgia was a supporter of theater nuclear modernization,which is the basic thrust of this particular amendment; in favor <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>of <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>it in such a manner that it would be coordinated,recognizing certain politically fragile situations in Europe without mentioninga country specifically.So I wonder if the Senator might address his views on the need to go forwardwith the theater nuclear modernization in the post-INF period.[S17MY8-153]{S5989}NUNNMr. NUNN. I would agree with the Senator on that. I do think we have tohave a follow-on to Lance. I do not want to leave any misimpression onthat. I think we have to have a follow-on to Lance, and the ATACMS is agood candidate for that.But before I voted for this, I would want to know what is going to happento the conventional program. Because ATACMS was not designed to replacea nuclear system. ATACMS was sold, and we funded it and everything aboutit <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>as been designed to replace some of the short-rangesystems, not the long-range systems that we are now so heavily dependenton, by having a conventional munition and a conventional role.Now, if we are going t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> convert it into a dual use, what I want to knowbefore we g<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> forward_and only a hearing could tell us this_iswhat is the continuing commitment of the Department of Defense to the conventionalrole. Are we going to end up, if we convert ATACMS, are we going to end<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>up <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>not having a priority with the conventional role,and are we going to be right back in this sort of spinning situation wherewe do not have the conventional forces to really provide an effective deterrent?We then go to nuclear systems, we become more dependent on those, thenwe go to early use of nuclear systems, short-range nuclear systems, andin the process we weaken our conventional defense, because it always assumesa second priority.So that is the question. It may very well be I can be persuaded that weought to have a dual role for ATACMS. And I certainly agree we need tohave a nuclear follow-on for the Lance. But this system has been designedfor a conventional role and I would have to be assured, and I have notyet been assured, that that pri<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ori<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ty would remain a very high priority if we are goingto make this a candidate for a nuclear role.[S17MY8-154]{S5989}SYMMSMr. S<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>MMS.

If I could have the Senator's attention to ask himsome questions and maybe the distinguished chairman might also help meout.I recall that every single witness that we had before the committee, inreference to the INF, what it does directly affects this, every administrationwitness_I think there might have been one German politician who counteredthis_but every other witness said that we should improve our flexible responseif, in fact, the INF is going to be ratified and put into compliance.I note in this amendment that you talk about the Atacms, but there is nomention of artillery, AFAP's. Is that the Senator's intention? I believewe should have that included, also. Every witness said that also.[S17MY8-157]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5990}<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, it wa<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s not the intention of the Senator from Virginiato put in a full range of the specifics. The purport of the amendment isto basically take certain sections from the Sena<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>te<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Armed Services Committee INF report, which is paragraphs1, 2, and 3, and then in the findings of the Senate, the sense of the Senate,paragraphs 1 and 2. So it is a restatement of the committee report.Essentially, the purpose is to get reaffimation of the Congress to goingforward with the theater nuclear modernization, which, I understand, thedistinguished chairman basically has just done. So, in a major way, hesatisfied the purposes of the amendment.[S17MY8-158]{S5990}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much.I would just say, Mr. President, that I think the point I would like tomake here is I think the Senator from Virginia is right on target withthis amendment. But, in context with the next debate that is going to takeplace in the Senate with respect to the INF, I think Senators that areplanning to vote for the INF should also be planning, first, to be preparedto spend a lot of money for verification and, second, to spend a lot ofmoney to remodernize NATO to replace what will be lost from our flexibleresponse.That is why I think the modernization of the artillery weapons is so critical.It is not mentioned here and it is not in the amendment. But I would liketo see this amendment go one step further is what I was saying to the Senatorfrom Virginia.

Mr. President, the amendment now pending at the desk on behalfof myself and the distinguished Senator from Georgia is identical in everyrespect to the amendment sent up by the Senator from Virginia with theexception that the last sentence in the last paragraph of the sense ofthe Senate has now been deleted. So, therefore, the purpose of my amendmentwill have been met in every respect, with the exception of a possible clarificationof the existing law with respect to what the Army may or may not do asit continues its test and evaluation research. I understand the chairman'sposition on this and I think he gives me the assurances we will have hearingson that point.Therefore, the amended amendment would meet the goals of the Senator fromVirginia.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.[S17MY8-168]{S5990}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia and I assurehim that I will schedule hearings with his cooperation and his coordinationon this subject. I have talked to the Senator from Massachusetts and hewill be pleased to participate in those hearings. We will hear from theDepartment of Defense and they can make their case about why this systemshould compete. And, in doing so, the most important factor to me is theyhave to make a case as to what is going to happen to the Atacms as faras their original role, the original purpose, which was why we spent themoney and which will keep NATO going down a hopeful path, long term, onbeing less dependent on the early use of short-range nuclear systems.Mr. President, I would urge the adoption of the amendment.[S17MY8-169]{S5990}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, there is no need to have the yeas and nays onthis.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.[S17MY8-170]{S5990}KENNEDYMr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take a moment. I appreciate theadjustment, the change that the Senator from Virginia has made in thisproposal. The issue here is a provision that Senator <T4>Nunn</T4> and I sponsored in last year's defense authorization bill,which bars development of a nuclear warhead for the Army tactical missilesystem [Atacms] until after a conventional version is deployed with U<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> forces in Europe. I am in favor of modernizationof nuclear systems in the NATO forces. But, the issue of whether that modernizationshould include a nuclear Atacms is not clear. Given Atacms crucial roleas a conventional system, developing a nuclear version of Atacms may potentiallylower the nuclear threshold. Accordingly, I believe that the procedurewhich has been outlined by the chairman of the committee involving a hearingon Atacms would help the Armed Services Committee, and hopefully the Senate,to make a prudent and reasoned judgment.There is $15 million in the current budget for a study of a nuclear versionof the Atacms. I understand the DOD does have some questions about theparticular language. I would welcome the opportunity to cooperate withthe chairman and the ranking minority member to ensure that we get a clarification.What has been worked out here, I think, is entirely satisfactory and Iwould hope that the Senate would accept the amendment as it has been modified.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.[S17MY8-171]{S5991}WARNERMr. WARNER. I first ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays on theunderlying amendment <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>be<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> vitiated.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.[S17MY8-172]{S5991}WARNERMr. WARNER. Second, I wish to ask a question of the Chair. The amendmentsent forward on behalf of myself and the Senator from Georgia should readin every respect like the underlying amendment with the exception of thelast sentence in paragraph 3 having been deleted, which means the firstsentence in paragraph 3 remains.I ask the Chair, is that the present amendment that is before the Senate?The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.[S17MY8-173]{S5991}THURMONDMr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.[S17MY8-174]{S5991}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, forgive the Senator from Virginia. I knew theSenator from North Carolina was prepared to speak.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.[S17MY8-175]{S5991}THURMONDMr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the first week in May I had the opportunityto go to Germany and confer with the top military commanders in that countryrepresenting our Nation. I conferred with General Kirk, the top Air Forcecommander in Europe; with General Otis, the top Army commander in Europe;and with General Richards, the deputy European commander.I also conferred with General Crosley, the chief of staff of the 5th Corps,and with General Reynard, the commander of the artillery of the 5th Corps.Mr. President, in conferring with all of these military commanders, withoutexception they strongly recommended modernization of theater forces. TheSoviets have doubled their short-range ballistic missiles since 1981 andthey quadrupled artillery-launched atomic projectiles. It is absolutelyessential that we take steps, upon entering into this INF Treaty, to modernizenuclear forces, theater nuclear forces.As I understand it, in talking with the commanders, they feel this shouldbe done without question. It should be done promptly in order to protectour interests and that of the free world.All of this modernization would include nuclear weapons. It would be afollowon to the Lance, the tactical air-to-surface missile, and to modernizingnuclear artillery.Mr. President, if we are going to do away with Pershing nuclear weapons,intermediate range, over there, if we are going to do away with the cruiseintermediate-range nuclear weapons, we must take steps to substitute powerin their place.We have no evidence yet that the Soviets have changed their goal of worlddomination, of spreading their aggression throughout the world. Therefore,we must be ready to protect ourselves and the free world.I would urge the adoption of this amendment. I further urge that we holdhearings and take steps to accomplish what these generals, the top commandersof our Nation, recommend.I feel this important. It should not be delayed. I do hope the chairmanand ranking member of the Armed Services Committee will hold these hearingswithout delay.[S17MY8-176]{S5991}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator fromSouth Carolina. Indeed, he made a trip which was directly related to thesubject matter of this amendment and his report, which has been made availableto all Senators, is a very valuable contribution. I think that the commentsmade by our colleague are directly on point.If there are no further Senators who desire to address this issue__[S17MY8-177]{S5991}THURMONDMr. THURMOND. Will the Senator yield?[S17MY8-178]{S5991}WARNERMr. WARNER. Yes, of course.[S17MY8-179]{S5991}THURMONDMr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator for his kind words.I ask him to add me as a cosponsor.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.The Senator from Virginia.[S17MY8-180]{S5991}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, seeing no Senators wishing to address this amendmentand the yeas and nays having been vitiated on the pending amendment, Isuggest the Chair now put the question to the Senate.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate on this amendment? Ifnot, the question is on agreeing to the second-degree amendment offeredby the Senator from Virginia.The amendment (No. 2099) was agreed to.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the amendment by theSenator from Virginia as amended.The amendment (No. 2098) was agreed to.[S17MY8-181]{S5991}WARNERMr. WARNER.

Mr. President, the question pending now is the Dole resolution;is that correct?The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is correct.[S17MY8-185]{S5991}KASSEBAUMMrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Republicanleader's resolution. I think Senator <T4>Dole</T4> has addressed this in a timely and important manner. I donot believe that we should be dropping the drug indictments against General<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Noriega <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>at this point.I also argue that the issue is larger than ju<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>st<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> whether these drug indictments should be droppedagainst Nor<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ie<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ga at this time. The issue is how we have handledthe crisis in Panama over the past several months.Our present efforts are not merely ineffectual. Rather, I think they workagainst the return of democracy in Panama, against respect for our ownjudicial system, and against hemispheric harmony.The publicity with which our efforts have been attended has made it difficultfor Panama's neighboring governments to bring their own leverage to bear.I firmly believe those governments share our outrage over Noriega, buttheir popular sense of sovereig<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nt<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>y has historically put priority on resisting theappearance of U.S. intervention. Our visibility has come to inhibit thepotentially more effective pressures of Nor<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ie<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ga's neighbors.Ironically, our awkward recent attempts at negotiating have leached themoral strength of our position. They have done nothing to relieve the appearanceof heavyhanded intervention. The result not only weakens our internationalimage, but inhibits the efforts of others with an interest in a democraticPanama.More important than even this, perhaps, is the damage done domestic<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>al<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ly to our own sense of justice. When negotiationsinclude tampering with the integrity of our own criminal justice system,we are wounding ourselves in ways we may never fully appreciate.Mr. President, our efforts, well-intentioned as they are, have been ineffectual.Now they threaten to become self-defeating and worse.I urge we consider a policy that offers Noriega's opposition every rhetorical,diplomatic, and economic support they may request. We should consider apolicy without negotiations, without concessions.I suggest several things: Stop intervention in our judicial process, leavethe indictments in place, and look forward to a day when they can be enforced.We should reassure Central Americans that the United States seeks no improperintervention in th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ei<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>r determinations. Offer any assistance neighboringgovernments might ask in implementing a regionally conceived policy towardthe crisis in Panama.It is of paramount interest not only to our Latin American allies, particularlyour Central American neighbors, but to ourselves. However, I think a point has been reached when we simply must not continueto appear to be ineffectual and weak in these efforts.I urge, Mr. President, the strong support in a bipartisan fashion by theU.S. Senate for the resolution put forward by Senator <T4>Dole.</T4>I yield the floor.[S17MY8-186]{S5991}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.[S17MY8-187]{S5992}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for thequorum call be rescinded.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.[S17MY8-188]{S5992}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I believe we are about to vote on the Dole amendment.I plan to vote for the amendment. I must say, though, we still are goingto have a difficult situation in dealing with the Noriega problem.As I view it, the administration has painted themselves and, indeed, ourNation on this matter into a corner. So we have painted ourselves intoa corner on the Noriega matter.I believe that there is a strong suspicion by the Senator from Kansas,Senator <T4>Dole</T4>, and many others, that the administration is about to handthe paintbrush to Noriega. As I view this amendment, it basically saysthe Senate should not permit that to happen, and the Senate should takeaway the paintbrush.When we get through passing this amendment, as I see it, we will have expressedthe Sen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>at<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e's sentiment that the paintbrush be taken away,but we are still going to be in the corner.So I do not see that we are proposing or solving the problem that we havepainted ourselves into. But, nevertheless, I plan to vote for the amendment.[S17MY8-189]{S5992}DURENBERGERMr. DURENBERGER. Mr. President, H.L. Mencken once said that for every problemthere is a solution that is simple, understandable and wrong. That's clearlythe case with the Senate vote today. It seems simple, understandable_andpolitically correct_to declare that we will not stand for dropping drugcharges against a corrupt political leader.And so it is_short term. And politically<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>correct short-term solutions are often easy_but wronglong term. Of course I'm horrified by the open drug-trafficking of thisdespot. Of course I want to send a message world-wide that we as a nationwill not tolerate such action.Mr. President, last year I authored Senate Resolution 239, approved bythis body 84 to 2, which called for the ouster of General Noriega. My votetoday is not pro dropping of the Noriega indictments, but rather it isanti throwing away our only bargaining chip in the high-stakes negotiationto remove Noriega from power and from Panama.To further the goal of democracy in Panama, the first thing we must dois to get rid of Noriega. Every other goal is, of necessity, secondaryto that objective. And the central issue is what we would get in returnfor dropping the charges. That must include an end to his despotic ruleand conditions that allow Panamanians the freedom to choose their own government.If the alleged deal to drop the indictment covers the political futureof Panama, it is wrong, because the political future of the country mustbe determined by the Panamanians. But if we can help rid the country ofthis tyrant, we will have enabled them to make that determination.Therefore, I will vote with what I assume will be a small minority againstthis amendment. The Republican <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eader's proposal may be good politics in a politicalyear, but it's not good policy. I would encourage my colleagues to takea minute to think about the consequences of this action here today, andconsider the costs of this kind of instant gratification amendment.Foreign policy, by its very nature, presents many of the kind of solutionsto which Mencken referred. I hope this body will pay attention to our well-establishedlong term interests, rather than the temporary passions of the moment.[S17MY8-190]{S5992}BYRDMr. BYRD addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If we might have some understanding as to whether or notwe are going to debate the D'Amato amendment further and, if so, how long,I have indicated publicly and in response to inquiries by Senators, andthe press that I intend to go to the INF Treaty today. I have not set aparticular hour. But that is my commitment. And I will do everything Ican to carry out that commitment. But there should be resolution of the amendment by Mr. <T4>D'Amato</T4>, one way or another, and I would be interested in hearingwhat Senators have to say. For that purpose I yield the floor. [S17MY8-203]{S5992}DOLEMr. DOLE addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader. [S17MY8-204]{S5992}DOLEMr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have been discussing what might follow on witha number of Senators, some very briefly. Obviously, we want to get on tothe INF Treaty, No. 1; No. 2, it is not our desire nor Senator <T4>D'Amato</T4>'s desire to hold up the defense authorization bill. Ithas been done remarkably well by the chairman and by the ranking member.It has been an outstanding job, and in a very short period of time. Wedo not want to be the fly in the ointment. So what we would like to do while Senator <T4>D'Amato</T4> is maybe debating this, maybe just discuss with the majorityleader or others an idea or two that we might have in an effort to endit on this side. I am certain there are many on the other side who sharethe same view as S<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>en<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ator <T4>D'Amato</T4>. If somehow we could put together an agreement whereby when the INF Treatyhas been disposed of that we could return to the D'Amato amendment as afreestanding bill as the first order of business, then I think we wouldbe in the position, at least I could recommend to the Senator from NewYork, that he maybe withdraw his amendment from this bill. I would be happy to discuss that privately with the majority leader, orwith others. The majority leader and I are on the same side of this issue.Maybe I should discuss it with others first.[S17MY8-205]{S5993}BYRDMr. BYRD. I am sorry. I was engaged in a conversation.Will the distinguished leader repeat what he said with respect to a freestandingmeasure?[S17MY8-206]{S5993}DOLEMr. DOLE. In my view, it would be satisfactory to the Senator from NewYork, the prime mover of this amendment, if we could reach some agreementthat after disposition of the INF agreement, some time after disposition,that we could take up the D'Amato amendment as a separate, freestandingmeasure, and try to dispose of it. We would like to have a time agreement.If not, at least we would like it not be subject to a motion to proceedbecause we are not subject to that now. Then maybe we could file a cloturepetition, have a vote on cloture, and see what happens.I know, knowing the schedule and knowing what the leader has in front ofhim, the leader does not want to eat up a lot of time. But if I could,I would be very pleased to discuss it with some of the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Me<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mbers on the other side, and then maybe come to themajority leader and indicate what we have been able to work out if thatwould be helpful.[S17MY8-207]{S5993}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, following the vote on the treaty, whenever thatcomes, or perhaps even at some point during the debate on the treaty, wemay have to deal with the matter of a Presidential veto of the trade billwhich is exceedingly important in the eyes of a good many Americans, ifnot most Americans. And it is important, as is the INF Treaty. So if weare able to avoid in some way discussion of the override during the debateon the treaty, then certainly immediately after the treaty is approved,we would be back to the override.I will do everything I can in working with the Republican leader and workingwith the Senator from Georgia and the Senator from Virginia, Mr. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Warner,<CODE-213>5</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213> in completing action on the DOD authorization billtoday.Perhaps something can be worked out. We must recognize the fact that theSenator from New York is within his rights to debate this amendment aslong as he can stand on his feet, and not give up the floor.I hope we can work something out whereby we could, because I intend togo to this treaty today.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I have never made a commitment yet that I have broken,I do not think, in the Senate.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>So I intend to go to the treaty today. But it wouldseem to me that we should work out an arrangement whereby there would bea time agreement on a freestanding resolution, because just saying that,yes, we will call up a freestanding resolution, I do not know how difficultthat is going to be, in light of the mountain of work that we face in thisSenate.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>There are only 74 days, including today, and includingSaturdays, with the exception of one Saturday, October 8, until hopefully,we can adjourn sine die no later than October 8, and I would like to seeus be able to adjourn sooner. But if we are going to adjourn October 8and not have to come back after the election, I think we will have donevery well.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>In the meantime, we have 13 appropriations bills,and let us not forget that we have the United States-Canadian free tradearea agreement, and we ought to know where we are going on the trade billbefore we get to that agreement.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I would like to see welfare reform, and there areother numerous measures, most of which probably are not as important asthose I have mentioned.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>What I have said is that we have a very busy 74 daysahead, considering the fact that we have two conventions.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>So, just to set this aside on the promise that wewill have a freestanding measure, I think we should face up to this measureand quit running from it.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I happen to be on the same side on this matter asthe Senator from New York [Mr. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>D'Amato<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>]; but if we are going to beg off on this bill andnot have a vote, there are good reasons why we need to make some otherarrangements at this point. We cannot just continue to put off and begoff on this question.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>It is obvious that there are a great number of Senatorshere who want to have a decision on it.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>So if the distinguished minority leader and others,myself included, can help work out an agreement whereby we can proceedto that freestanding amendment, without debate, and have a time limit onit, with a vote up or down, it would seem to me that it would be a goodway to get <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>on <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>with our business.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S17MY8-208]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S5993}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>DOLE<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, let me say again, forthe benefit of my colleagues and for the benefit of the <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Record,<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213> that this Senator has no intention of needlessly_Isay needlessly_delaying the important work of this body, and it is importantwork.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>By the same token, I think it is fair for us to underscore_andI say ``for us,'' because there are a substantial number of my colleagueswho have joined me in this effort to bring up the matter of whether ornot there should be a death penalty bill broader than that which existsalready, as it relates to covering certain kinds of activities, premeditatedkilling as it relates to the criminal enterprise of the drug organization,the kind of reckless indifference to human life as characterized by thisheadline of last Thursday: ``Drug War's Terror Toll; Sleeping Woman ShotIn Fusillade.''The fact is that in both cases and in the case where there was premediated,intentional killing, law enforcement officers and others, I think it isthe overwhelming belief of this body, not just this Senator, that the appropriatedeterrent should be the death penalty.The fact remains that for a long time now, going back to at least 1984,we have been unable to get a vote on this because there has been the threatof filibuster. By the way, that is reasonable. That is part of the processof this body: <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hat the minority, if they feel strongly upon a subject,can do all they wish as it relates to deterring the majority from movingforward. I do not condemn anybody for that. By the same token, I thinkwe have to recognize that at some point in time, the majority has a right,particularly when it is more than 60 Senators, to have their voice heard.So, while I respect the rights of the minority, or those who feel stronglyin opposition to the death penalty_and they have a right to employ theirrights, the procedures necessary to protect their interests and their pointsof view_I also think it is important that we now set forth here that thatright should not be taken away from the majority. You can criticize thatin any way, shape, or form.If we can come to a suitable agreement, lay aside this amendment, to bringit up as a freestanding bill, with a time certain, so that we can havea legitimate debate and vote and resolve, that is something this Senatorbelieves would accommodate not just the Senator alone but the majority,and get a determination from this body, not one person, and recognize thatthis is a matter that has been debated, and debated, and debated. The willof the majority, I believe, has been thwarted quite effectively until now.This Senator does not intend to yield to the kind of pressure that wouldcontinue the will of the majority or the majority's point of view beingthwarted. I say that quite candidly. There are others who may want to expresstheir opinion here. I certainly have no objection to that. But, again,I will say that when it comes to this kind of terror killing_``Drug War'sTerror Toll; Sleeping Woman Shot''_they just scraped the building, shotinto the building indiscriminately. If that is not reckless indifferenceto human life, and it is proven, it seems to me that the person who killedthis person should be subject to the death penalty.When it comes to the case of Eddie Byrne, a police officer who was deliberately,premeditatedly assassinated, if you get the person who pulled that gun,who gave that order, it is this Senator's viewpoint that that person shouldpay with their life, with no mitigating circumstances, and if there are,let the jury decide. We should not decide here. I think certainly a juryshould decide whether or not the death penalty would be applicable in thosecases. Mr. President, I want to serve notice that this Senator is determined thatwe will get a vote on our bill, the death penalty bill, as it relates tothose who are dealing in drugs. If we do not get it today, if we do notget it tomorrow, I hope we can agree to a time certain, so that we canget on to other important business. Let there be no mistake that this Senator is determined not to yield untilwe resolve this issue.[S17MY8-210]{S5994}amendment <ITAG tagnum="89">amendment no. 2071 to amendment no. 2070</ITAG>Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

[S17MY8-217]{S5994}NUNNMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I realize we are not through with this bill. Iam, I guess, on the optimistic side that perhaps we are going to be ableto finish it today. I would just like to give the Members some idea ofwhat we have done thus far, since we are down to one amendment. If we canwork out that amendment in some fashion, schedule it later or have it withdrawnin some some fashion, then we will be able to vote on final passage onthis bill today.Mr. President, as the Senate concludes the debate on the fiscal year 1989defense authorization bill, I particularly want to thank Senator <T4>Warner</T4> and all of our colleagues on the Armed Services Committeefor an extraordinary amount of hard work this year, both in the committee,subcommittee, and on the floor. Since January the Armed Services Committee has held 32 hearings on NATOdefense and the INF Treaty. Many of those hearings lasted 4, 5, 6, someof them 7 or 8 hours. We conducted seven markups on the report that the committee made to theSenate on the treaty. So we have had a tremendous load on the INF Treatyand, of course, the Foreign Relations Committee has also had a tremendousload, as has the Intelligence Committee.In addition to that, we held a total of 45 full committee and subcommitteehearings on the amended fiscal year 1989 defense budget. We spent a weekand a half in April marking up the bill in subcommittee, as well as thefull committee, and we reported the bill to the Senate on May 4.The Senate began debating this bill on Monday, May 9. We have debated thisbill for 7 days and, of course, into the evening on several occasions.We have handled more amendments in less time than ever before.Senators might be interested to know that we have disposed of 93 amendmentson this bill. There have been an additional 53 amendments that have beenlisted that we have had to deal with and prepare for that have not beentaken up. So we have dealt with, in one fashion or another, 146 amendments.Ninety-three of the amendments have either been acted on or withdrawn ordisposed of. Sixty-two amendments passed by voice vote, 5 passed by rollcallvote, 14 have been tabled by rollcall vote, 2 have been ruled out of order,6 were withdrawn, 2 failed to be tabled by rollcall vote, and 2 second-degreeamendments fell when the first-degree amendments were tabled.We have had, I would say, about as equitable a sharing here as we couldin terms of who sponsored the amendments. We have had 48 amendments offeredby Democrats and 45 offered by Republicans.I would say the Republicans won that one. I think the side that offersthe least amendments, as far as the floor manager is concerned, wins. SoI praise the Senator from Virginia for exercising more restraint on hisside than we were able to muster on this side.I think Senators will also be interested to know that May 17 is the thirdearliest date the annual defense authorization bill will have passed, ifwe pass it today, in the last 20 years. In my view, one of the main reasonsthe Senate has been able to act promptly on the bill this year is the factthat last year Congress approved, for the first time, a 2-year DefenseAuthorization Act for fiscal years 1988-89.The budget request by the Defense Department submitted this year was arevision or an amendment to the second year of last year's 2-year budgetrequest. Our committee's re<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>vi<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ew of the amende<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> fiscal year 1989 budget request was carried outmore promptly and efficiently because of our work last year.I would also say a major reason that we were able to move this quicklythis <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ye<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ar was the 2-year budget agreement that was enteredinto between the White House and the congressional leadership on both sides.Had that agreement not been entered into, we would not have had a budgetresolution, we would not have had an overall defense number, we would nothave had an outlay number, and our bill, even if we had it before the Senate,would not contain an outlay total that would comply with the budget resolution.I do not know how many people really know_the staff on both sides understandsthis_how difficult it is to figure outlays_that is, how much is going tobe spent i<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> this fiscal year_and actual dollars spent on a defenseauthorization bill, which authorizes budget authority for the Departmentof Defense to go out and contract expenditures for programs and procurementsthat may last anywhere from 3 years to 7 years. In other wor<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s, not only is this bill, which I hope will passtoday, within the budget authority totals by the budget summit last year,<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>it<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> is also within the outlay targets, which means theactual dollars we will spend on defense this year from the Department ofDefense.Last fall's deficit reduction agreement provides further proof of benefitsof a 2-<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ye<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ar budget cycle. If we were able <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>o have an executive-congressional kind of overallframework agreement on a 2-year budget at the beginning of a cycle withthe domestic and defense totals at least being laid out, it would makean enormous difference in how effectively and efficiently we are able tohandle that on the floor of the Senate and the House for the next 2 yearsand, in turn, that will make an enormous difference in the way the DefenseDepartment is able to plan and program.So if any<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ne wants to say that procedures are not important,let them look at the procedures here. Procedures turn into hard, cold dollarssaved for the taxpayers. Procedures that are effective and efficient turninto more military capability for our men and women defending this Nation.And when procedures are inefficient, we have j<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>us<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t the opposite. We have money wasted and we havean awful lot of military effectiveness that is dissipated because we arenot able to act in front of a problem rather than have the problem runover us.Last fall's deficit reduction agreement was very important in that respect.Because of that agreement, we started this year with a consensus on theoverall level of national defense spending for fiscal year 1989. This consensusi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> allowing the authorization and appropriations processesfor defense programs to proceed in a much more orderly and timely mannerthis <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ye<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ar_so far. I have been here long enough to know thatyou can always ge<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> a hitch. We may have a hitch yet on this bill. ButI hope we will continue on the path we are on.As I indicated in my opening remarks on this bill, Secretary Car<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ucci has stated that he intends to submit another2-year budget for the Defense Depar<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ment next year.I also wi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>h to pay tribute, in this respect, to former Secretaryof Defense Weinberger, who started this 2-year budget process in the Departmentof Defense in response to congressional initiatives but, nevertheless,did it very enthusiastically. He started the process at a time when itdid not appear that there was a great deal of support for it. I believeformer Secretary of Defense Weinberg<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>er<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> i<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> due a vote of thanks in this respect by all of us.Our committee remains committed to maki<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ng<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> further pro<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>gr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ess in implementing a 2-year budget for the DefenseDepartment. We will continue to work to convince others in the Congress,both in the authorization committee on the House side_and they have beenvery cooperative thus far_and in the Appropriations Committee, that thatis the way we ought to be going for as much of our expenditures as we can;not all of it, perhaps, but as much as possible.I also think ther<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> is a lesson here for other committees. I believethe whole Federal budget process would work much better if we approachedit 2 years at a time.I wish to thank the ranking member of the committee, Senator <T4>Warner,</T4> my good friend, who has been my partner in managing thisbill on the floor. Without Senator <T4>Warner</T4>'s leadership and assistance, we truly would not have beenable to get the bill out of committee in the fashion it came out, let alonehandle it as effectively as we have on the floor. So I thank the Senatorand his very capable staff for their splendid cooperation.I also want to thank the chairman and ranking members of the subcommitteesfor their work in the committee and on the floor in moving this bill along.I particularly want to thank Senator <T4>Exon, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></T4>Senator <T4>Dixon, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213></T4>Senator <T4>Shelby, </T4>and Senator <T4>Quayle </T4>for the many hours they spent in the floor manager's seatover the past 7 days. Senator <T4>Dixon </T4>and Senator <T4>Quayle </T4>undertook the mission of helping us arrange the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>timeframe <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>for these amendments, and it has greatly expeditedthe process. When you are a floor manager here, you are dealing with the substance ofnot just one amendment but usually about 10 or 15 amendments at one time.You are trying to hold a conference with various people. You are tryingto get the essence of their arguments for their amendments. You are tryingto make a judgment about whether to recommend its passage. While you are doing that, it is virtually impossible to be very effectivein lining up the next amendment. So the result of that, usually, is thefloor managers have a difficult time keeping the business moving. Senator<T4>Dixon </T4>on our side, I think, did a remarkable job. He spent manyhours on the telephone, telling Senators what the status was and givingthem an opportunity to come to the floor, urging them to come to the floor.And Senator <T4>Quayle </T4>did a lot of that very important work on the Republicanside. [S17MY8-218]{S5995}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, would the distinguished chairman add Senator<T4>McCain</T4>? He spent many hours, too. [S17MY8-219]{S5995}NUNNMr. NUNN. I certainly will. I think Senator <T4>McCain </T4>did a wonderful job here and I am delighted the Senatorfrom Virginia called my attention to that because he was very, very helpful.In particular I want to thank the majority leader, Senator <T4>Byrd, </T4>for his help and assistance getting this bill completed.When we brought this bill up a week ago Monday we did not expect to beat this stage on the following Tuesday morning. As I mentioned, we arenot through yet. We have another possible hitch but I think we have atleast an opportunity to finish today and none of us would have thoughtwe would have been able to have completed this before the INF Treaty, understandingthe INF Treaty was and still is the priority, when it has become ripe.And it now has become ripe for Senate consideration. I am very grateful to the majority leader not only for scheduling it butfor his tremendous leadership in helping us move this bill. Without hishelp there would simply be no way to do it. I think too many people do not understand the tough job that being majorityleader is. When they are out here on this floor and have to manage a bill,as I know the Senator from Mississippi has done for years and years andyears, he has managed bills on this floor, they then begin to understandthe tough job, sometimes the thankless job of being majority leader. It is very difficult to perform that job. I think we are all, in the future,no matter who the next majority leader may be, whether it is a Democrator Republican_that will depend on the makeup of the Senate of course_butno matter who it is we are going to look back and we are going to say:This majority leader did a marvelous job for the U.S. Senate and for theNation. I realize that<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I realized it for some time but I realize it morehaving managed this bill for several years, than I ever realized it before.Mr. Leader, I say thank you for the splendid job you do for this institutionand, indeed, for the Nation. No one is more attentive to our national securitythan the Senator from West Virginia. He not only helps us proc<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>durally but he helps us substantively and we arevery grateful for that. We face a difficult conference with the House. [S17MY8-220]{S5995}STENNISMr. STENNIS. Would the Senator yield me 1 minute's time?[S17MY8-221]{S5995}NUNNMr. NUNN. I would be delighted to yield. [S17MY8-222]{S5995}STENNISMr. STENNIS. Mr. President, I want to use that time in warmly thankingthese gentlemen here who have done this fine job with this bill, thankingthem for the other 98, the rest of the membership.I have some vague idea of the enormous amount of work and responsibilitythey carried, day and night, and looked to the future with courage andmet some conditions that needed that modification. The country will profitfrom those conditions being remedied and changed, for many years to come.I feel happy for the body. This is appreciated by the membership. It is<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ealized and appreciated by the entire membership.It is really a great body, and I am delighted to have a chance to see whatwas accomplished. In years to come, we will all see the good that it did,the truth that it brought. I congratulate them and their staffs for whatthey have done.Thank you very much. [S17MY8-223]{S5995}NUNNMr. NUNN. I th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nk the Senator from Mississippi. No one knows betterthan the Senator from Mississippi the importance of this bill and the deficultyof moving it all the way through the legislative process. The Senator from Mississippi has handled this legislation and been in thisspot more hours and days and nights than anybody in the history of theArmed Services Committee. So he has done a remarkable job over the yearsand has been dedicated to our national security. He still is. He stilloccupies that very, very important role of being chairman of the AppropriationsCommittee. And we are delighted and honored to work with him on a dailybasi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> so I thank him for his comments. [S17MY8-224]{S5995}STENNISMr. STENNIS. If the Senator from Georgia would yield to me for just a half-minuteI want to w<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rmly thank him for the remarks that he has made.One of the marvels that I have seen in the years that I have been hereis his development, here, and achievements. He is still in motion goingthe right way. I want to name for identification, here, the Senator fromGeorgia, and also the Senator from Virginia, as being the ones that I referredto a few minutes ago, the head of the staff seniors, that put over thismarvelous job over a year, legislative year, So they were the ones thatI have been referring to, by name, and I repeat those sentiments. Thank you very much. [S17MY8-225]{S5996}WARNERMr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator from Georgia would yield, itis<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> very special privilege for us both to be here onthe floor with the mentor that taught us what we know and taught us howto guide the Senate in the consideration of the importance of the ArmedServices Committee bill. We learned at his elbow. [S17MY8-226]{S5996}NUNNMr. NUNN. One correction I would make. He taught us the good things weknow. I would not want to attribute anything other than the good thingsto him because he set a very fine example. While we have Senator <T4>Stennis </T4>and Senator <T4>Thurmond </T4>on the floor, both of them having been champions of ournational security for many, many years, I think the Members might be interestedto know what happened back in 1969. This year Senator <T4>Warner </T4>and I ha<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>v<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e spent 7 days on the floor; last year we were 15days on the floor. When we get through we are worn out, we feel like wedeserve a little break. Senator <T4>Stennis </T4>managed this bill on the floor in 1969 and Senator <T4>Thurmond </T4>was right there, at that time, for 37 days. Thirty-sevendays this bill was on the floor. The next year, in 1970, there was debate on this bill for 28 days on thefloor. Of course that was during the Vietnam war period with an awful lotof emotions. But I have some appreciation, having spent 7 days on the floorthis year and more time in previous years, but nothing like that, whata terrific job and responsibility that was during that very difficult period.So, I thank, personally, the Senator from Mississippi as well as the Senatorfrom South Carolina, while they are on the floor, for that tremendous leadershipthey have given our Nation on behalf of the men and women in our militaryservices, and those who have served in the past.[S17MY8-227]{S5996}THURMONDMr. THURMOND. Mr. President, would the Senator yield?[S17MY8-228]{S5996}NUNNMr. NUNN. I would be glad to yield to the Senator from South Carolina.[S17MY8-229]{S5996}THURMONDMr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I have been on the Armed Services Committeenow for over 30 years, and I have never seen a bill handled more expeditiouslythan it was handled this time.I want to commend the able Senator, the chairman of the committee, Senator<T4>Nunn, </T4>of Georgia, and the ranking member, Senator <T4>Warner, </T4>from Virginia, for their good work.I also want to say that no man in the Senate has served more faithfullyand capably in armed services matters than the distinguished Senator fromMississippi. I worked with him all these years. He was a member of theArmed Services Committee when I went on there and, as I say, I have beenon the Armed Services about 32 years. It has b<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>een<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> a pleasure to work with him and assist him in everyway I could.Again, I want to compliment the distinguished chairman and ranking memberhere, and I also would like to express my appreciation to the able majorityleader. He has always been courteous, he has been helpful; and that isa thankless job.Just as you said, it is a tough job. It is the toughest job in the Senate.The able Senator from West Virginia, the majority leader, has done thisand done it in a very fine, respectful, and able manner.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Indeed, we <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>learned <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>at his elbow through the years and will continuefor many more to have the privilege and the benefits of his wisdom, hehaving served in World War II with distinction and having risen to therank of major gen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>eral<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> in the Reserve <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>For<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ces <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>of<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the U.S. Army.So he is a man who brings to the Senate not only the wisdom of the peopleof his State but the benefit of his experience, having worn the uniformof the United States for many years.We thank our distinguished colleague from Mississippi. Things seemed tobe a little simpler when I ca<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>me<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to the Senate and he presided over the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Arm<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ed Services Committee. I suppose we are the onesat fault for making it more complicated now.Many times have the chairman and I gone back into the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>off<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ices of the majority leader at points during thecourse of the consideration of this bill and other bills when it seemedalmost impossible to move but somehow he and the distinguished Republicanleader always find the means <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>by<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> which to keep major pieces of legislation such asthis one on track and moving forward. We owe him a great debt.And to my dear friend and distinguished chairman, he is too modest to praisehimself so on behalf of all members of the committee, staff, and indeedthe Senate as a whole, we pay our respects to him.[S17MY8-231]{S5996}NUNNMr. NUNN. I thank the distinguished Senator.[S17MY8-232]{S5996}THURMONDMr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished Senatorfor his kind remarks.[S17MY8-233]{S5996}NUNNMr. NUNN addressed the Chair.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.[S17MY8-234]{S5996}BYRDMr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield? [S17MY8-235]{S5996}NUNNMr. NUNN. I will be glad to yield. [S17MY8-236]{S5996}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will not take much time, but having been aroundthis great institution for 30 years, I have had the opportunity to seesome great chairmen of this Armed Services Committee. I sat on the ArmedServices Committee when Richard Russell was chairman of that committee.I took the seat of Lyndon B. Johnson when he left that committee and becameVice President of the United States. I think most every Senator in thisbody knows of my reverence for the late Senator Richard Brevard Russellfrom Georgia. I also possess a great reverence for the Senator from Mississippi, Senator<T4>Stennis. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>He made an impression on me the first day I walkedinto this Senate. It was a good impression, and it was well placed. Hehas always epitomized integrity at its best. When I first came to the Senate, Senator <T4>Thurmond <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>was on this side of the aisle. I once heard Senator<T4>Russell <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>say of Senator <T4>Thurmond, </T4>``He is absolutely fearless.'' Fearl<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ess<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. I have found him to be such. I have also foundhim to be fair to all, and a great patriot. We hear the word ``patriot''a good bit these days. Senator <T4>Thurmond <CODE-213>5</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>fulfills the definition of the word very well. I have seen good ranking members of committees. Senator <T4>Warner </T4>is <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ranking member who is never arbitr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ary,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> who is always patient, willing to listen to theother person. He is reasonable. He is a good man with whom to work. Hehelps a chairman in his important capacity as ranking member. He is thetop man on the other side of the aisle on the Armed Services Committee,and these two make a good team. Without his cooperation and teamwork, wewould not make progress on this bill. I do not suppose anybody watches this Senate and watches Senators likeI do and like I have for 30 years, at least 22 out of those 30 years whenI have been in the leadership one way or the other. I have to say, in allmodesty, that I have been the majority leader, so far as floor battlesare concerned, for 22 years. The distinguished predecessor of mine, Mr.Mansfield, was in fact the majority leader, but he had no love for therigorous floor work dealing with rules and precedents, so I have been onthe floor for 22 years, 10 years sitting at his elbow, and I have seenSenators come and go. I have seen Senators who did not know how to managea bill. I have seen Senators whom I had to prop up. They were the managersof bills. I had to prop them up to keep them going, pushing them. A few Senators are not like that. I could name more than one, but I amonly going to name one today. That one is the Senator from Georgia, Mr.<T4>Nunn. </T4>In my judgment, he is a Senator who, from the day he walkedinto this Senate, marked himself in the eyes of the rest of us as a manto watch, a man to listen to. It was not very long until we knew that,indeed, he was a man to watch, and it was not long until I decided thathe was a man to whom I should listen on matters concerning national defense.The Apostle Paul said, ``Walk in wisdom toward them that are with<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>out.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> * * * Let your speech be always with grace, seasonedwith salt.'' This chairman follows the creed that is laid down in that great scripturalpassage_walk in wisdom toward them that are without. He is wise because he does his homework. On any matter concerning our nationaldefense, I am going to go to Senator <T4>Sam Nunn </T4>and see what his opinion is. When he speaks on this floor,I am going to turn my chair around and listen to what he says. If thereis <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="80">only one other Senator found around here_and there will be others_when<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Sam<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213> speaks on national defense, it will be <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Robert Byrd<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, unless there is a constituent from West Virginiacalling me to come off the floor<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>But Senator <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Nunn<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213> demonstrates that he knows his subject, he knowswhat he is talking about, and it is not by a process of ossification thatone is able to demonstrate that kind of knowledge. He speaks always withgrace. He is reasonable. He is fair. He may not agree with me or anotherSenator, but he always has the courtliness to listen and to accord theother individual the right of his viewpoint. He displays that kind of intellectualintegrity that excites admiration. And then he speaks always with salt.One knows that underneath that courtly approach there is a firm hand onthe controls; there is a steady hand there; there is a strength there;and there are convictions<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I take great pleasure in commending him and the rankingmember because they <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>are<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> entitled to commendations and thanks from all ofus. To have so skillfully managed a bill of this kind for 7 days, to havedisposed of 93 amendments and to have handled 53 other amendments, a totalof 146 amendments, one way or another, and to be at the point now of votingfor final passage with the exception of one pending problem which will,I am hopeful, go away for another day during this day, they have demonstratedagain the necessity for and the value of teamwork<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>There is no more important bill than this bill<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I have often said I did not want to give <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Sam Nunn<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213> up to be Vice President of the United States, butI think everybody can readily see that I could make a fairly good nominatingspeech, certainly one within my limitations<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>But I again compliment Mr. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Nunn<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and Mr. <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Warner<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, and I think the Senate and the nation are fortunateto have men like Senators Russell, <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Stennis, Thurmond, Warner, <CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>and <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Nunn<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to help guide us in these momentous days and theeventful days ahead.

Mr. President, the Senator from Virginiaand I would like to rest a little bit but we cannot do that because ifand when we pass this bill today, and I hope we will pass it today, I amtold that we have 300 to 400 languages differences with the House bill.We have 400 to 500 funding differences with the House bill. Everyone knows<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>that<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> when we make laws, we have to have a conferencereport, a conference report has to be agreed on by the House and Senate,and it has to be identical. So we have about 700 matters to take up inconference. The sooner we get this bill passed, the sooner we can start that conference.We will probably take several weeks in the confer<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ence<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. I have talked only briefly with Congressman <T4>Aspin</T4>. I know they have been working very diligently on the Houseside, Congressman <T4>Aspin</T4>, Congressman <T4>Dickinson</T4>, and others, and we will be hopefully meeting them inconf<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>erence<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> some time next week. So, Mr. President, I would just close by saying that I am very gratefulto the staff. We ha<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ve,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I thi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nk,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the finest staff in the Armed Services Committeethat I have ever served with. In some instances, the staff has come fromprevious chairmen. We have operated the staff for a long number of yearsto the maximum extent possible on a bipartisan basis. We now have ArnoldPunaro, our staff director on the majority side, and Arnold and his wholeteam have done a tremendous job this year. They were able, as I mentioneda few minutes ago, to devise a software computer program which I will notexplain because I cannot. That program was developed by Mike McCord ofthe committee staff. It basically allowed the staff to immediately tellus the outlay implications for every budget authority item. So if we werevoting on an amendment that would add two aircraft carriers, or a destroyer,immediately they could tell us not only the budget authority over the yearsbut the implications to the dollar for the outlays for this year. We have never had that challenge before, as I mentioned, because we havenot had the budget resolution out front before. This bill is in tune withoutlays. We have been able to get the outlay implications immediately forevery amendment introduced on the floor. That enabled us to stay withinthe ceilings and to make sure that the S<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>enat<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ors understood the fiscal and budgetary implicationsof what they were doing with the amendments. So the staff has done a tremendous job. I thank Arnold Punaro, David Lyles,Jeff Smith, John Hamre, Andy Affron, and others who have been here on thefloor and behind the scenes helping us in every way possible. I also want to pay tribute to Carl Smith, Pat Tucker, and the minoritystaff. [S17MY8-241]{S5997}WARNERMr. WARNER. Bob Bott and others. [S17MY8-242]{S5997}NUNNMr. NUNN. Bob Bott.

Mr. President, with that, having made this speech, I think it is essentialthat we pass the bill now. If we do not pass the bill, all of these wordshave been wasted, and I do not want to put any pressure on anyone but Iwould hope just as soon as possible we can resolve the D'Amato amendment,and delay argument on that for another day, and move on to pass this legislationwhich, hopefully, will go along with the speeches to the House of Representativesso we will be prepared for conference. [S17MY8-245]{S5997}WARNERMr. WARNER.

Mr. President, this morning the Commerce Department releasedthe figures on the March trade deficit. The March deficit joins a riverof red ink that flows through the whole of this administration. The glimmerof sil<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ver<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> in this cloud, Mr. President, is that the deficitdropped just over $4 billion from February's $13.8 billion to March's $9.75billion. Fifteen years ago that would have roughly matched our trade deficitfor an entire year_$9.75 billion for the entire year.  Turning that into good news is like making a mountain out of a molehill,or a silk purse out of a so<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>w's<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> ear.  A close look at the details of trade is no cause for comfort. The broadincrease in exports is genuinely good news. But about 20 percent of theincrease stemmed from gold sales. That is the kind of rose that does notmake for a financial summer. What is most disturbing is the actual risein overall imports despite a drop in the price of oil and a $600 milli<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>on<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> fall in oil imports. Manufactured imports also roseby more than a billion and a half dollars. In one category of machineryafter another the United States continues to experience large deficits.Machine tooled imports now command a substantial share of the Americanmarket. When we talk about machine tool imp<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>orts<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> commanding a substantial share of the American market,we are talking about the national security of this country because withoutmachine tools, we do not have ships, submar<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ines<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, tanks, guns, planes, and missiles. When we areput at the mercy of other count<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ries<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> for our machine tools, we are putting our nationalsecurity interests in other hands.  Wh<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ere<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> there once was strength, there is a growing dependence,and it is about time we woke up as we say because we are not going to bewaking up to good morning in America if this trend continues. It is alreadylate.  The $9.75 billion deficit adds another hill to our mountain of externaldebt. At the end of last year, Mr. President, our net external debt hadpassed the $400 billion mark_$400 billion mark. That is $400 for everyminute since Jesus Christ was born_$400 billion. $400 for evey minute. It was not long ago that this country was the world's largest creditor,and today this country is the world's largest debtor. We are in hock tothe other count<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ries<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of the world, and it is about time we began associatingour trade deficits with our national security.  The debate is no longer protectionism versus free trade. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>That<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> is not the debate any more. The debate should beon our national security, because we must learn that national securityis infinitely tied with economic security and that trade policy is thefoundation stone of that economic security. We are failing the Americanpeople when we fail to see that and when we fail to act to do somethingabout it.  This trade deficit means more than just dollars <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>in<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> terms of exports versus imp<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>orts<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. It adds up to economic security and to nationalsecurity, and the American people are going to catch on to the fact oneday that economic security is the backbone of military security and thatwe are in hock to the other countries of the world. The great United Statesof America, Uncle Sam, in hock to foreign investors, foreign count<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ries<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> buying up assets of this country. How much longerwill <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>we<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> be in control of our own house? That is what thisis about. When are we going to get control of our own house? When are wegoing to put our own house in order?  We are on a defense authorization bill. We have been talking about thenational defense. But who is talking about trade? Who is talking aboutforeign countries, foreign governments, foreign investors gaining the upperhand? They are buying up American assets. They are buying up American realestate. They are buying our bonds. They are buying our financial paper,and they are getting the upper hand.  The machine tools industry may not employ very many people. But if we <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ever<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> get into a war and have to depend upon Japan forour machine tools, then what we are doing is putting our lifeline in thehands of somebody else, putting it in<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the hands of another country_machine tools thatare so vitally needed to build the precision instruments, to build theinstruments that are necessary for this Nation's defense.  Month by month, year by <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>year<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, we are forging a chain of debt that we will haveto drag into the future. Our financial markets keep a nervous eye on theintentions of foreign investors. When the Germans or the British or theJapanese are not buying our bonds, interest rates turn up and the financialmarkets are poised for a fall.  In a very real sense, Mr. President, we are forcing our Treasury to dothe tincup two-step in one financial capital after another, running fromone capital to another with a tincup in our hands.  It is time we got off this financial roller coaster where trade figuresgo from bad to worse and back to bad again. The President can take a longstep in the right direction by signing the Omnibus Trade and CompetitivenessAct. The trade bill will help open new markets for American exports. Itbuilds long-term competitiveness with investments in individuals and innovation. It would help to educate the young people of this country so that theycan compete in tomorrow's markets. It enhances and emphasizes the educationof our people. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t emphasizes engineering and math and science andforeign languages. It faces the fact of economic change. Instead of clingingto the forms of the past, the trade bill promises workers new opportunitiesthrough education, training, and decent notice of a plant closing or masslayoff before the wolf is at the door.  Not only does <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>it<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> promise the employee who is about to receive thepink slip, but also, it promises and gives notice, fair notice, decentnotice, to the communities_to the communities that are about to be injuredby a plant closedown.  Times have changed, Mr. President. We are in a time when fighting foreignprotectionism is the best way of fighting protectionism at home. It isan era when our abil<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ty to lead the free world is link<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>d to our ability to compete in free markets.  Congress has worked for years to craft the Omnibus Trade and CompetitivenessAct. Time and again, we have walked an extra mile to strike a compromisewith the administration. The administration has not wanted a trade bill.The administration had 6 years in which they were in full control of theSenate. They did not want a trade bill. They could have had one. But we,who were in the minority then, wanted trade legislation. We could not getit. We could not get it to the floor. Who is to believe that the administrationreally wants a workable, effective trade bill now?  Now, at the 11th hour, our President wants to turn back the clock by denyingworkers a little warning that they are about to lose their jobs. I wouldhope that the President, who has been known to change his position at the11th hour, will change it again. I hope that he will see that the long-termnational interests require that he sign this bill, that he sign the billthat has been sent down to him. If he wants a trade bill, he can have it. There are those who are talking about another trade bill already. Mr. President,this bill is alive and it is well, and the President can either be theundertaker or he can be the physician who gives it the stamp of approval.Its pulse is normal and its breathing is normal. Its blood pressure isnormal. Its temperature is good. It is alive and very, very well and kicking. It is like the bo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ys<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> who thought they would tant<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>lize the old philosopher. They approached him andsaid, ``Let's fool him. Let's take this bird in our hands, and we willask the old man if the bird is dead or alive. If he says it is alive, wewill crush it. If he says it is dead, we will open our hands, and it willfly away.''  The President has it in his hands. It is alive. He can crush it or he canlet it live.  Today, the Senate will turn its attention to the INF Treaty. As I saidyesterday, I feel it is a good treaty. It is much better than it was whenit was first sent to the Hill, and that is a tribute to both the Senateand the administration, the administration negotiators who went back, puttheir hands back on the plow, and the Senate insisted through its committeesthat there were loose ends that needed to be tightened.  I hope that the treaty will be app<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>oved for ratification. And it is not beyond the limitationsof reason to feel that it is possible to approve the ratification beforethe President leaves for the summit. I have always said from the beginningthat should not be our main goal. But that is still possible, consistentwith thoroughness and with adequate debate on substantive matters. I thinkthe Senate ought to take whatever time is needed. But beyond that, anydelay for the sake of delay is certainly not one of the approaches I wouldembrace.    By the Senate's approval of ratifying of the treaty and the President'ssigning of the trade bill, the President could depart for Moscow with twotriump<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s in his hands, two packages in his pockets, bothsides bulging, one with the treaty with a blue ribbon on it, the otherthe trade bill.It would show the Congress and the executive working together for peaceand prosperity.

That is what the arms controltreaty is all about, as a matter of fact. We are trying to advance thecause of peace.So, Mr. President, I say to Mr. Reagan most respectfully_sign the bill.Sign the bill.The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That is what leads to security.We are thankful for the majority leader's eloquence, which comes afterhis leadership, in making the case for why the President of the UnitedStates, to enhance all of our security in all of its dimensions and increasethe national strength of our country for the least of these, our brethren,should sign that bill and have those two accomplishments in hand, the ratificationof this treaty, if it is the Senate's will under our constitutional obligation,and the trade bill in hand.And I would like very much to associate myself with the majority leader'scomplete remarks.[S17MY8-259]{S5999}BYRDMr. BYRD.

Mr. President, as a member of the Congressional Commissionon Security and Cooperation in Europe, I, like the distinguished occupantof the chair, the Senator from Massachusetts <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>[<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. <T4>Kerry<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, </T4>and many others, am daily concerned with theimplementation of the human rights aspects of the Helsinki accords. I becameeven more concerned in the last few days when newspaper<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>headlines on President Reagan's speech in Chicagoread:``President Softens Harsh Tone, Lauds Soviets on Rights'' in the MiamiHerald;``Reagan Credits Gorbachev on Human Rights; Cites U.S. Failings'' in theNew York Times;``Reagan Applauds Gorbachev Gains on Human Rights'' in the Baltimore Sun;and ``Reagan Applauds Soviet Headway on Human Rights'' in my hometown paper,the Atlanta Journal.I could go on and on and on.To say the least, this is a departure from the normal Presidential rhetoricon human rights as it pertains to the Soviet Union. While I think thatsome of President Reagan's past remarks_references to the ``evil empire''and the like have been extreme and even count<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rproductive_I cannot help thinking Wednesday's speechin Chicago was both unwise and more importantly inaccurate.I was particularly struck by newspaper reports that Mr. Reagan had praisedthe Soviets for ``significantly higher'' emigration last year, and thatit was ``fine'' with him for the Soviets to recognize human rights forreasons of their own in order to gain economic benefits or better relationswith the United States of America.For the President to praise the Soviets for last year's emigration increasessimply misrepresents the total picture. For instance, in 1979, approximately51,000 Jewish emigrants were allowed to leave the Soviet Union and reunifywith their families. Last year the f<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>gure was approximately 8,000. This is not progress,unless you give the Soviets credit for moving up from the 900 figure of1986.The facts are that the Soviet Union cut off Jewish emigration after theAfghanistan invasion at the end of 1979, and they kept it cut off for 7years. During those sad and difficult years, it was my privilege to serveas the cochairman of the Congressional Coalition for Soviet Jewry, andI remember the suffering of those who were separated from their parents,their children, their husbands and wives, and their brothers and sisters,and not allowed to emigrate.In effect, Moscow was holding almost 300,000 Soviet Jews as virtual hostagesto the improvement in relations with the West, and the re<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>toration of the economic benefits from the UnitedStates and the West in the form of trade, technology, and credits thatwe have been discussing today. To hold human lives as bargaining chipsin East-West relations is an appalling practice that ought to be condemned,never applauded.We know, of course, that the Soviet Union is not going to turn into a Western-sty<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e democracy in the foresee<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>able future.When I served in the House of Representatives, I served on the ForeignAffairs <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommittee and 8 years on the Intelligence Committeeof the House. I know fro<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>m<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> personal experience that we have to be realisticand practical. The Helsinki Final Act and its followup process, a meetingwhich has been ongoing in Vienna since 1986, is an appropriate forum forthe United States to press other signatory countries, including the Soviets,to live up to their human rights promises.Last year, as the Vienna meeting moved into the negotiating stage, theCongressional Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, was informedthat the United States would remain resolute in our determination to insiston performance rather than promises. Our firm<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ess and patience<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>on this point throughout the Helsinki process haspaid off in our success at holding all signatories accountable for theirrecords.Specifically, with regard to the Soviet Union, the United States took thepo<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ition that we seek th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> release of all political prisoners<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>;<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> that we want an end to the jamming of our radiotransmission<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>; that we seek a significant increase in immigrationfigures; and that all bilateral family reunification and binational marriagecases should be resolved.These positions, I hope and trust, still are the positions of the Americandel<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>gation in Vienna.

Parallel to superpower talks, generalinterest started to focus on security issues. On the other hand, the SovietUnion hardened its position regarding human rights at Vienna's follow-upmeeting. This position is glossed over by the release of individual dissidentsand an increase in the number of travel permits. But there have been nofundamental changes of the Soviet human rights policies despite new legalprovisions.

A change of CSCE strategy became particularlyapparent in the case of the American position.

The Soviet delegation,which had already come back from Christmas recess with hardened positions,took its time and waited several weeks before saying that some points ofthe mediation paper were ``worth discussing''; it was obvious that Moscowexploited the American conciliatory move. They probably did so on the assumption_alsoheld among Western delegations_that basket three was not a top priorityof Washington at the moment. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>here was remarkable frustration among many Westerndelegations, because America seemed to give up its role as spearhead inthe human rights struggle.</ITAG>[S17MY8-281]{S6001}a meager `<ITAG tagnum="89">a meager ``provisional consensus paper''</ITAG>[S17MY8-282]{S6001}<ITAG tagnum="21">This development led to the drafting of an extremely meager text containinga few passages of a ``preliminary consensus for a final document'' on humancontacts, information, education and culture in the so-called notebookof the competent working group at the Vienna meeting in late March.

Further elementaryformulations that are unfitting for the text of a CSCE final document,concern, for example, technical improvements in train and telephone services.Conference participants on all sides are untiringly calling the lamentablepaper a provisional starting point, which, ``of course,'' needs elaboration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If one compares the scope and content of this text to the Austrian-Swissproposal on cooperation in the humanitarian and cultural areas dating fromJuly 30, 1987, and to the ``Non Paper'' of the Swedish coordinator of December18, 1987, which dealt with the same issues, one realizes that there isa wide gulf between these two drafts and the ``consensus paper'' of March22, 1988. Particularly the Austrian-Swiss proposal was boldly phrased andincluded new substance; it spoke of the ``continuing grave shortcomingsin the implementation of the CSCE provisions.'' And the paper goes on tosay that this situ<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tion has to be overcome through intensified effortsto ``promote confidence and humanitarian cooperation among the participatingstates.''

Mr. President, today I would like to honor the tremendous effortsof the Tiogue School, which is one of 30 elementary, and secondary highschools across the country to be recognized as a ``Drug Free School.''This elementary school has been honored by the Department of Educationas a national leader in the field of drug prevention and education. Butthe real tribute goes to its principal, John Ruzanski, and the program'sfounder, Jane Viti, for their drive both to establish this program andto make it a success. Both have given generously of their time and talentto maintain a drug free attitude and environment in their school. This school was the first in Rhode Island to create a ``Just Say No'' club.The club is comprised of sixth graders who meet twice a month to learnabout the hazards of drugs and learn that there are many healthy and responsibleways to have fun. These sixth graders serve as role models for the youngerchildren in the school. The Tiogue School rightly provides antidrug instructionto its sixth graders. It is extremely important that this instruction beginsin the very early years. Such instruction in the sixth grade helps to ensurethat these students will enter junior and senior high school with the commitmentand strength to avoid drugs.This year, the ``Just Say No Club'' at the Tiogue School wrote and performeda 1-hour play for the whole school filled with skits and cheers to conveythe antidrug message. This show was so successful that they were invitedby another school to perform the play for their student body.The antidrug message is a central focus of the school. For example, everyday the ``Just Say No'' flag is raised. The club has marched for the past2 years in the Pawtucket Valley St. Patrick's Day Parad<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, carrying banners and posters which the studentwrote and designed. And, the club was subsequently invited to lead thestatewide, ``Just Say No'' march in Providence.This impressive program is the product of the involvement of the PTA, businessand other community organizations. The innovative projects and communityinvolvement show clearly why Tiogue Elementary was awarded this nationalrecognition.As we escalate our efforts to control the pernicious threat of drug abuseand addiction by cracking down on supply routes, we need to emphasize thecentral importance of eliminating the demand as well. One of the b<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>st ways to <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>my <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mind of achieving this goal is through educationalefforts such as the program at the Tiogue School.

Mr. President, 107 years ago this week, on May 16, 1881, theNation witnessed the dramatic resignations of both U.S. Senators from NewYork in a showdown with the President of the United States.Two months earlier, James Garfield had been inaugurated President. Immediatelyafterward relations between the Republican President and perhaps the mostprominent Republican Senator, Roscoe Conkling, began deteriorating. Conklingrepresented the stalwart wing of the party that staunchly defended thepatronage system. Garfield tended more toward civil service reform. WhenGarfield appointed an antistalwart man as collector of the Port of NewYork_a patronage-rich position_Conkling took the action as a personal offense.As the Senate prepared for a major confirmation battle, Conkling made abold decision and a risky gamble. He and his Senate colleague, Thomas C.Platt, both submitted their resignations from the Senate. They would returnto Albany to be reelected by the State legislature, as was the practicebefore the 17th amendment to the Constitution. Their reelection would signalNew York's support for its Senators in their confrontation with the President.However, fate intervened. In July, while Conkling and Platt were campaigningin Albany, a deranged office seeker who identified with Conkling, shotPresident Garfield at a Washington train station. The President lingeredfor another 2 months before his death, becoming a national martyr for civilservice reform. In that atmosphere, the New York Legislature declined toreelect either Conkling or Platt, and the Senate confirmed Garfield's candidatefor collector of the Port of New York. In tribute to Garfield, PresidentChester Arthur supported enactment of the first civil service act.Although years later Platt returned to the Senate, Roscoe Conkling's politicalcareer ended when his dramatic gamble failed.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>[S17MY8-304]{S6003}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S17MY8-305]{S6003}NATIONAL D<ITAG tagnum="81">NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S17MY8-306]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S6003}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>D'AMATO<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. D'AMATO.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for thequorum call be rescinded.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.[S17MY8-315]{S6004}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, the principals are still working on an agreement,hopefully whereby the D'Amato amendment can be taken up at a differentdate and time, and either taken up as a freestanding measure or in connectionwith some other bill. Both sides on the question on both sides of the aisleare working diligently to try to resolve this situation so that the Senatecan pass the DOD authorization bill and go on with the treaty.But I understand from Senator <T4>Levin </T4>and others that a little more time is required. They aremaking progress.[S17MY8-316]{S6004}order of p<ITAG tagnum="89">order of procedure</ITAG>It is my suggestion, after talking with the manager of the bill and aftertalking with the Republican leader, that the Senate proceed to take upthe INF Treaty and that there be a reading of the treaty only down to thepoint where the signatories of the treaty appear on the treaty. That wouldprovide for the first 17 sections, I believe, of the treaty.That would require about an hour, I am told.After that, the Senate would dispense with the reading of the protocolsand the treaty would be ready, then, for action, for debate and actionby the Senate.I would like to do that by unanimous consent. There is no problem in goingto the treaty without unanimous consent. We can do that by voice vote orwe can do it by rollcall vote; the motion to proceed into executive sessionis not debatable. The motion to come back out of executive session intolegislative session is not debatable. So, that is only a matter, at worst,of 15 minutes on a rollcall vote going each way.The entire treaty is subject to a reading by the Senate. I hope we willnot go through the entire reading of the protocols and everything becausethat might require a day or two. But I think that we ought to have thefirst 17 sections read. That will not take more than an hour and that willgive the Senators time to work on the other problem which is before theSenate, the D'Amato amendment before the Senate. There is no way to takethat down without taking the DOD authorization bill with it at this pointand we do not want to do that.So, if there is no objection, I would like to proceed to the treaty onthat basis, that we would have a reading of those 17 sections, down tothe signatories, President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev; and then, by then,at the end of that time, the Senate would then be brought back into legislativesession by unanimous consent. Otherwise we will just have to go a stepat a time.I yield to the Republican leader.[S17MY8-317]{S6004}DOLEMr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think we have made some progress on the D'Amatoamendment. There have been a number of suggest<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ons. As you might understand, as many Senators asyou have, you have about that many suggestions.But I think there has to be some understanding. If it could be broughtup at a time convenient to the majority leader on some day certain we could<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>wor<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>k out, and then have a reduced postcloture time,identify the amendments, shorten the precloture time, we could probablywork it out as a freestanding amendment. That is one option.The other option is one that the majority leader is now entertaining justmoving to a treaty. Some may suggest finishing the treaty, and then comeback to the DOD bill. It seems to me we might be able to do better thanthat. This bill is important not only to the managers but many other Members,and to the country. So we will during this reading time have a chance tomeet again and hopefully hammer out some agreement. I would hope, too,that we are not going to demand that the entire treaty be read, the wholeprotocol. That would take, I am told, 6 or 7 hours. To me that would indica<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e an effort to stall this treaty right up front.I hope that does not happen. But one Member can change that.[S17MY8-318]{S6004}BYRDMr. BYRD. Does the Senator from North Carolina wish me to yield?[S17MY8-319]{S6004}HELMSMr. HELMS. I thank the majority leader.Does the majority leader contemplate the waiver of points of order?[S17MY8-320]{S6004}BYRDMr. BYRD. No.[S17MY8-321]{S6004}HELMSMr. HELMS. Let us leave open, if the majority leader will, the readingof the protocol. I do not think I want to do that. But if we will leavethat out for the time being and just make a judgment further down the line,I have no desire to delay the treaty. But I do want enough time to thinkabout things. So I would like to have that option.[S17MY8-322]{S6005}BYRDMr. BYRD. Would the Senator allow us to proceed up to and through the 17sections, at which point we then pause and take another look at the situation,because once we start reading, and the reading can be had of everythingupon the demand of a single Senator, if we start that reading and any Senatorobjects to calling if off, we are in probably the rest of the day justreading it. And we will not get back to the DOD authorization bill at alltoday, at least until the reading of the protocol and any amendments orwhatever else may be attached.So my thought was if we could read the first 17 sections down to the signatures,that lays into the <T4>Record</T4> the material that the American people can read in the <T4>Record</T4>. It gives the various Members on both sides of the aisle,on both sides of the question, a little more time to work out the D'Amatoamendment and, where we go from there. It saves the DOD authorization billfrom being relegated to the delay heap for a while. And it allows us toaccomplish two objectives, it seems to me at once.[S17MY8-323]{S6005}McCLUREMr. M<T4>c</T4>CLURE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I takethis time only to indicate for the part of this Senator, I have no desireto delay the consideration of the INF Treaty. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>here has been a great deal said about the importanceof completing the Senate action if indeed we can do so prior to the President'sdeparture for the summit. I think there is a widespread feeling acrossthe country that the President ought to be armed with that signed treaty,rather than go without that opportunity in dealing with the Soviet Union.It is unfortunate that we are where we are on the DOD bill, that it ispressing up against the time for the consideration of the INF Treaty. ButI would not want to be understood as indicating that I think under allcircumstances the DOD bill must be completed in order to consider the INFTreaty, and I read into this some of the feeling that the D'Amato amendmentis the only thing that is holding up the DOD bill, and therefore we haveto dispose of the D'Amato amendment and somehow that all takes priorityover the consideration of the INF Treaty.I do not want any implication of what we are doing here that somehow weare going to do whatever we have to to complete the DOD authorization billeven if it means delaying the treaty further.[S17MY8-324]{S6005}BYRDMr. BYRD. That inference should not be drawn. The chairman of the committeehas explicitly stated on more than one occasion that while it is his desire,and he will speak for himself, to finish the DOD authorization bill andget it to conference, it is not his desire to hold up the treaty. He iswilling to set the bill aside. He said that 7 days ago when we first wenton the DOD authorization bill. He made it perfectly clear that at any timebefore the final action on the DOD authorization bill that the negotiatorstied up the loose end and we were ready to go forward in the interest ofthis country and its security, he would be willing to set the DOD billaside. So there can be no inferences drawn. There have been no implicationsto that extent. It has just been to the contrary.I yield to the Senator.[S17MY8-325]{S6005}NUNNMr. NUNN. Will the Senator yield for a further clarification? [S17MY8-326]{S6005}BYRDMr. BYRD. Yes. [S17MY8-327]{S6005}NUNNMr. NUNN. The Senator from West Virginia is entirely correct. Senator <T4>Warner</T4> and I have said from the very beginning of the debate onthe DOD bill when the treaty matters that were under investigation by theIntelligence Committee, Foreign Relations Committee and Armed ServicesCommittee were completed, at any time the majority leader wanted to moveto the INF Treaty we would be willing to set the DOD bill aside. We were very fortunate in the fact that the DOD was able to continue for6 days. We did not get through with the hearings until late yesterday afternoonon the INF Treaty, and the ranking members and the chairman of the IntelligenceCommittee and Armed Forces Committee did not report to the majority leaderuntil last night about 8 o'clock or 8:30. So the DOD bill has not heldup the INF Treaty even 1 minute, even 1 second. We do not intend for itto. Now, it is true that we cannot handle the DOD bill until such time as wedispose of in one way or the other D'Amato amendment, but we <ITAG tagnum="80">are not leaguing the INF Treaty to the D'Am<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>to amendment; we are not leaguing the INF Treatyto the DOD bill. </ITAG>The majority leader is on the floor asking for the INF Treaty to come up.DOD is not completed. We understand that. We hope we can work out the D'Am<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>to amendment. We hope we can pass the DOD bill today.But if we do pass it, if we work out the D'Am<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>to amendment, it will take a grand total of maybe5 or 6 minutes. We have already even made our final speeches and pattedourselves on the back as if we had passed it, which we have not done. Sowe have had a premature back-patting session here. We may regret that.Nevertheless, it will not hold up the INF Treaty. [S17MY8-328]{S6005}McCLUREMr. <T4>McCLURE</T4>. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? [S17MY8-329]{S6005}BYRDMr. BYRD. Yes. [S17MY8-330]{S6005}McCLUREMr. <T4>McCLURE.</T4> I thank the majority leader, and the distinguished Senatorfrom Georgia, the manager of the bill. Yes, I know that is exactly whatthe position has been. But I did not want anything that was said here todayto indicate any change in that position. I would assume from that if somethingbreak down the negotiations over the D'Amato amendment that means we moveto the INF Treaty without having completed action on the DOD authorizationbill. I see the Senator from Georgia nodding his head. And I mention that becauseI really am concerned about the death penalty provision as any Member inhere. I know the Senator from Georgia supports that provision, too. I donot want to see that struck by a deadline and disadvantage, final actionby this Senate with respect to it. I commended the Senator from Kansas, and the Senator from New York earlierfor having brought to the floor last night and completed action this morningon the resolution with respect to dealing with Noriega and the policy wehave there. They are linked together in the fight against drugs. I wouldhate to see us vote by a vote, I think, of 86 to 10, in favor of that actiondealing with Mr. Noriega and at the same time somehow backing water withrespect to the death penalty which I know both the Democratic leader andthe distinguished manager of the bill have supported. I would not wantus to be sending ambiguous signals here today on that subject. [S17MY8-331]{S6005}NUNNMr. NUNN. Will the Senator yield for a brief moment? I would say that theSenator is correct. We are not going to hold up the INF Treaty for theDOD bill. We hope to work out the D'Amato amendment. I personally willvote for the D'Amato amendment. I hope it is on another piece of legislation.I hope the Senator from New York and all who are in favor of that willremember the important provisions that already have gone into this billrelating to the surveillance by the military, relating to <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>setting up<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the command control and communication by the military,related to a very carefully prescribed power of arrest by the military,and will understand that as far as the drug traffickers are concerned,the first thing you have to do is catch them before you execute them. Ifyou do not catch them, you cannot execute them. So that has already passed.The Senator from New York played a vital role, the Senator from California,the Senator from Virginia, the Senator from Georgia, all of us, in gettingthat passed. That is going to help us catch them. So if we have to choosebetween the two, let us go ahead and pass the DOD bill, start catchingthem, and then we will worry about executing them later. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>[S17MY8-332]{S6005}BYRDMr. BYRD.

Unless their name is Noriega, and you turn them loose.I agree that we should not turn Noriega loose just because he happens tobe in a position of some importance in another country. I agree with theSenator from Georgia that we ought to catch him.I agree that it was an unusual event when many of us voted to have themilitary forces of this <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ountry involved in what is essentially a police action.That is a step that I supported rather hesitantly, because I think it isa dangerous precedent, but I believe it was necessary and it was justified.If it was necessary and justified to do that, to take that unprecedentedaction in our Nation's history, if it is necessary and justified and supportableto do what the Senate did in support of the Dole resolution, which I commendand heartily support, I also think it is important for us to keep focuson what we do to the fellows we do catch who are in the narrowly proscribedconditions with respect to the death penalty. I do not see us wal<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>k<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing away from that part of this package too casually.I will not object, since I do understand that the managers of the billwant the opportunity to work out the D'Amato amendment, if they can. Ifthey fail to do so_and I am not going to obstruct that process_we wouldexpect to move to the INF Treaty and dispose of it.I thank the Senator for yielding.[S17MY8-335]{S6006}BYRDMr. BYRD. I have made my commitment publicly, and there is only one individual_Iwill put it in that vein_in the universe who can keep me from doing that,and he is not on the floor. That is the Good Lord.We are going to go to the treaty today, one way or another. I do not wantto sacrifice the bill which is so near completion here, the DOD authorizationbill.[S17MY8-336]{S6006}joint offi<ITAG tagnum="89">joint officer management policies of the goldwater-nichols departmentof defense reorganization act of 1986</ITAG>[S17MY8-337]{S6006}NUNNMr. NUNN. M<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. President, yesterday, Senator <T4>Exon </T4>and Senator <T4>McCain </T4>engaged in a colloguy concerning the joint officer managementpolicies prescribed in title IV of the Goldwater-Nichols Department ofDefense Reorganization Act of 1986. Unfortunately, I was not availableon the Senate floor when that colloquy occurred. Because title IV is animportant and controversial subject, Mr. President, I would like to presentmy views.Title IV of the Goldwater-<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>N<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ichols <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ct made a determined effort to correct serious problemsin the performance of joint duty by military officers. Joint duty, Mr.President, is an assignment outside a military officer's own Service. Jointduty includes assignments on the Joint Staff, in the Office of the Secretaryof Defense, and on the headquarters staffs of the unified combatant commands.When the Congress was working on defense reorganization, Mr. President,we found that, for the most part, military officers did not want to beassigned to joint duty; were pressured or monitored for loyalty by theirservices while serving on joint assignments; were not prepared by eithereducation or experience to perform<ITAG tagnum="80">their joint duties; and served for only a relatively short periodonce they had learned their jobs. Given that these joint staffs are ourmost important military staffs, this was an intolerable situation. Theoperational failures and deficiencies that we have experienced_such asthe Iranian rescue mission and the Grenada incursion_were caused by ourinadequate jointness, or in other terms, the inability to effectively plan,prepare, and execute the employment of forces from more than one service.Title IV set goals for overcoming joint duty problems. </ITAG>At the time that title IV was enacted, Mr. President, we knew that modificationwould probably be necessary as implementation experience identified unanticipatedproblems and better approaches. Since enactment of the Goldwater-Nicholsact, the Senate Armed Services Committee has worked closely with the Departmentof Defense to improve the statutory policies for joint office management.Last year, the committee offered a package of modifications. Only a limitednumber of these changes, however, were approved by the Senate-House conferencecommittee. The defense authorization bill now being considered by the Senate wouldmake 19 additional modifications to title IV. This bill includes each ofthe seven joint officer policy changes requested in DOD's legislative proposal.The committee also took the initiative to include 12 additional modifications.I believe that these changes would permit more equitable, flexible, andsimplified implementation of title IV. I intend to make my best effortto obtain conference approval of these modifications. However, it should be clearly understood, Mr. President, that these modificationsdo not represent any lessening of the committee's commitment to the underlyingprinciples of title IV. In this regard, some service officials have recentlyproposed changes to title IV that would fundamentally weaken efforts toimprove the performance of joint duty service. These proposals, which callfor short <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>joint <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>duty tours and elimination of joint education requirements,would return us to the intolerable situation that existed prior to theGoldwater-Nichols act. It is my clear intention, Mr. President, to opposesuch changes. Hopefully, as the Congress proceeds to improve joint officermanagement policies, we will continue to adhere to the fundamental principlesof title <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>IV<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of the Goldwater-Nichols act which seek to betterprepare and reward military officers <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>serv<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing in joint duty assignments. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>[S17MY8-338]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S6006}<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>F<ITAG tagnum="66">F<CODE-213>0</CODE-213></ITAG>[S17MY8-339]{S6006}WHY THE SO<ITAG tagnum="81">WHY THE SOVIETS CAN'T WIN QUICKLY IN CENTRAL EUROPE</ITAG>[S17MY8-340]{S6006}WIRTHMr. WIRTH. Mr. President, John M<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ear<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>sheimer, author of the highly regarded book <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>``<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Conventional Deterrence<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>''<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> provides a seminal analysis of the conventionalbalance on Europe's Central Front in terms of the Warsaw Pact's abilityto win quickly in a conventional conflict.Mearsheimer contends that the conventional balance is not nearly as outof balance as is widely perceived. His aim here is to assess the Warsawpact's capacity to affect a blitzkrieg against NATO. To measure this capability,Mearsheimer evaluates whether the Soviet Union has the ``force structure,the doctrine, and the raw ability'' to implement this strategy. He furtheranalyzes NATO'<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> defense capabilities and the theater's terrain inan effort to determine NATO's ability to thwart such a blitzk<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rieg<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. His essential conclusion is, that while NATO certainlycould not win a conventional war with the Soviet Union, it could deny ita quick victory and then hold out in a war of attrition.As noted, Mearsheimer evaluates pact force structure, doctrine, and rawability in his assessment of the pact's capacity for a blitzkrieg attack.Regarding force structure, he contends, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>first<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, that the pact does not have overwhelming manpoweradvantages <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>vis-a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>-vis NATO, and does not have sufficient manpowerfor a blitzkrieg attack; second, that the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>pact <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>has irrefutable numerical advantages in weapons,but that NATO's edge in quality and training largely neutralize the pact'sstrength in numbers; and, third, that, while NATO's mobilization and reinforcementcapabilities may not equal the pact's, NATO has the potential to maintainoverall ratio of forces very close to <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>pre<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mobilization ratios.Regarding doctrine, Mearsheimer assumes that in a conventional war, theSoviet Union will employ a blitzkrieg attack, that is, they will amassarmored forces along one or several points on the defender's front, piercethat fro<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nt,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and rapidly advance to the enemy's rear. What arethe prospects for the Soviet Union to achieve this strategy? Accordingto Mearsheimer, one must evaluate two important criteria: First, can the<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>pact <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>achieve the necessary force ratios along the mainaxes of attack in order to puncture <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>NATO<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>'s lines of defense, and second, if the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>pact <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>can pierce NATO's lines, can the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>pact <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>then successfully advance to NATO's rear areas. Basedon well-known NATO deployment patterns as well as geographic and topographicalconstraints, and likely Soviet deployment patterns, Mearsheimer concludesthat NATO could most likely stop a Soviet blitzkrieg attack and convertthe conflict into a war of attrition.Regarding Soviet and Warsaw pact raw ability to execute such an attack,Mearsheimer expresses considerable doubt as the to the pact's prospectsfor success. While noting that pact forces are configured for blitzkrieg,Mearsheimer details weaknesses in Soviet training, in the ability of lowerlevel officers to take initiative, in overcentralized command structures,and in the uncertain reliability of non-Soviet pact forces. He remainsskeptical that the Soviet Union would have the requisite ability to executethe complex and difficult blitzkrieg attacks with the necessary precison.While Mearsheimer believes NATO could successfully meet a pact blitzkriegattack, he specifies two important caveats for continuing these prospectsfor success: First, NATO must proceed with on-going improvements in itsforce structure, including strengthe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing the sustainability of forces; and, second, NATOmust mobilize, and it must attempt to do so in ways that do not provokeSoviet at<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ack. Mearsheimer, like other analysts, assigns extremeimportance to warning time and mobilization. A prerequisite for NATO successin thwarting a pact blitzkrieg is receiving ample warning time and thenmobilizing immediately to meet the threat. Even a few days delay couldbe disastrous for NATO.Following is Mr. Mearsheimer's thoughtful piece from National Security,which will supplement our understanding of conventional arms control issues.I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the <T4>Record.</T4>There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the<T4>Record, </T4>as follows:[S17MY8-341]{S6007}Why the So<ITAG tagnum="74">Why the Soviets Can't Win Quickly in Central Europe</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="59">0[S17MY8-342]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S6007}<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>(John J.

Certainly, NATO's behavior in a major crisis wouldbe influenced by its view of the conventional balance. Furthermore, one'sperception of the conventional balance directly affects his or her viewof the importance of both strategic and tactical nuclear wea<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ons for deterrence in Europe.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The fact of the matter is that the balance of conventional forcesis nowhere near as unfavorable as it is so often portrayed to be. In fact,NATO's prospects for thwarting a Soviet offensive are actually quite good.Certainly, NATO does not have the capability to win a conventional waron the continent against the Soviets. NATO does have, however, the wherewithalto deny the Soviets a quick victory and then to turn the conflict intoa lengthy war of attrition, where NATO's advantage in population and GNPwould not bode well for the Soviets.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The aim of this article is to examine closely the Soviets' prospectsfor effecting a blitzkrieg against NATO. In analyzing this matter, twoclosely related issues must be addressed. First, one must determine whetherthe Soviets have the force structure, the doctrine, and the raw abilityto implement this strategy. In other words, do the Soviets, when viewedin isolation, have the capacity to effect a blitzkrieg? Secondly, whenNATO's defense capabilities and the theater's terrain are considered, whatthen are the prospects for Soviet success? It may very well be that theSoviet military is wellprimed to launch a blitzkrieg, but that NATO inturn has the capability to thwart it.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Any assessment of the NATO-Pact balance is dependent on certain assumptionsmade about the preparatory moves both sides take before the war starts.Among the many that might be considered, three scenarios are most oftenposited. The first of these is the ``standing start'' attack, in whichthe Soviets launch an attack after hardly any mobilization and delivera knockout blow against an unsuspecting NATO. This is not, however, a likelyeventuality.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Secondly, for a war in Europe to become a realistic possibility, therewould have to be a significant deterioration in East-West relations. Givensuch a development, it is very likely that both sides will take some steps,however limited, to increase the readiness of their forces. It is difficultto image a scenario where an alert Pact catches NATO completely unprepared.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The second scenario is a more realistic and more dangerous one. Here,in the midst of a crisis, NATO detects a Pact mobilization, but does notmobilize its forces for a fear of triggering a Soviet attack.

With this measure of divisional manpower, theSoviet advantage shrinks to 1.36:1. Fischer calculates that when overallmanpower levels on the Central Front are considered, the Pact's advantageshrinks even further to 1.09:1. This is because NATO has traditionallyhad more men assigned to combat units which are not organic to divisions.Since the study was issued, the Pact ha<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> added approximately 50,000 men, raising the overalladvantage in manpower to 1.15:1_hardly an alarming figure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These figures are clear evidence that NATO is not hopelessly outnumbered.</ITAG>[S17MY8-347]{S6007}weapons<ITAG tagnum="89">weapons</ITAG>[S17MY8-348]{S6007}<ITAG tagnum="21">It is not difficult to compare numbers of specific weapons on eachside.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Such comparisons, however, do not take into account qualitative differenceswithin the same category of weapons nor do they deal with the problemsof comparing different categories of weapons (i.e., tanks vs. artillery).</ITAG>[S17MY8-349]{S6007}enforcemen<ITAG tagnum="89">enforcement and mobilization</ITAG>[S17MY8-350]{S6007}<ITAG tagnum="21">Now, consider the critical matter of comparative reinforcement capabilities.Although NATO's reinforcement capability is not as great as the Soviets'in an absolute sense<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> NATO has the potential to keep the overall rat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>o of forces very close to the pre-mobilization ratio.The notion that the Soviets can rely on some massive second echelon thatNATO cannot match is a false one. However, the ratio of forces in any futuremobilization will be heavily influenced by the timeliness with which eachside starts to mobilize. If NATO begins mobilizing its forces before thePact does, or simultaneously with the Pact, then the force ratios willremain close to the 1.2:1 (in armored division equivalents) and 1.36:1(in divisional manpower), the ratios which obtained before mobilization.If NATO starts mobilizing a few days after the Pact, then the balance offorces should approach but not exceed a 2:1 ratio in the very early daysof mobilization and then fall to a level close to the pre-mobilizationratios. But once the gap in mobilization starting times reaches seven days(in the Pact's favor), NATO begins to face serious problems, problems whichbecome even more pronounced as the mobilization gap widens further.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It should be emphasized that there are definite limits to the utilityof measuring force levels.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Nevertheless, it is clear if one side has an overwhelming advantagein forces, that glaring asymmetry is very likely to lead to a decisivevictory.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The previous analysis of the balance of forces in Europe indicatesthat the Soviets do not enjoy such an overwhelming advantage. They do nothave the numerical superiority to simply crush NATO. In a conventionalwar in Europe, whether or not the Soviets prevail will depend on how theyemploy their forces against NATO's defenses. In other words, success willbe a function of strategy, not overwhelming numbers.</ITAG>[S17MY8-351]{S6007}doctrine<ITAG tagnum="89">doctrine</ITAG>[S17MY8-352]{S6007}<ITAG tagnum="21">NATO's forces are arrayed to support a strategy of forward defense.In other words, to meet a Pact offensive, the forces in each of NATO'scorps sectors are deployed very close to the border between the two Germanies.How do the Soviets plan to fight a non-nuclear war in Europe?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The assumption here is that they will employ a blitzkrieg. This strategycalls for the attacker to concentrate his armored forces at one of morepoints along the defender's front, pierce that front, and race deep intothe defender's rear. The aim is to avoid a broad frontal attack and, instead,to drive a small number of powerful armored columns into the depths ofthe defense.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To determine whether the Soviets can successfully launch a blitzkriegagainst NATO's forward defense, two key questions must be answered. First,can the Soviets achieve the necessary force ratios on their main axes ofadvance so that they can then open gateways into NATO's rear? In otherwords, given the deployment of NATO's forces as well as the terrain, howlikely is it that the Soviets will be able to repeat the German achievementopposite the Ardennes Forest in 1940? Is it true, as advocates of a maneuver-orienteddefense claim, that the Pact can choose any point on the NATO front andachieve the superiority of forces necessary to effect a breakthrough?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Second, if the Soviets are able to tear open a hole or two in NATO'sdefensive front, will the Soviets be able to exploit those openings andpenetrate into the depths of the NATO defense before NATO has a chanceto shift forces and slow the penetrating spearheads? Effecting a deep strategicpenetration in the ``fog of war,'' when the defender is doing everythingpossible to seal off the gaps in his defense, is difficult and requiresa first-rate army. How capable is the Soviet Army of accomplishing thisdifficult task? Although it is not possible to provide definitive answersto these questions, there is good reason to believe that NATO is capableof thwarting a Soviet blitzkrieg and turning the conflict into a war ofattrition.</ITAG>[S17MY8-353]{S6008}the initia<ITAG tagnum="89">the initial deployment patterns</ITAG>[S17MY8-354]{S6008}<ITAG tagnum="21">When considering Soviet deployment patterns for a conventional Europeanwar, the most basic question is: how will the Soviets apportion their forcesacross the front? More specifically, will the Soviets disperse their forcesrather evenly across the front, mounting attacks along numerous areas,or will they concentrate their forces at one, two, or three points alongthe inter-German border? In many of the accounts by Western an<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>lysts, it is assumed that a Soviet offensive willbe a multi-pronged one.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is possible that the Soviets might choose to launch an offensivealong multiple axes of advance. This would be consistent with their doctrinefor fighting a nuclear war in Europe, where the emphasis is on keepingthe attacking forces widely dispersed so that they are not vulnerable tonuclear attacks. However, such a deployment pattern would hardly facilitateemployment of a blitzkrieg, simply because it would be virtually impossiblefor the Soviets, given the present overall balance of forces, to achieveoverwhelming force ratios on any of the axes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If the Soviets hope to defeat NATO with a blitzkr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ie<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>g, they will have to concentrate massive amountsof armor on one, two or, at most, three major axes of advance. This raisesthe obvious questions: where are those axes likely to be? and how well-positionedis NATO to deal with the most likely Pact deployment patterns? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is most unlikely that the Pact would place a major axis of advancein either the far north or the far south of the NATO front. In the south,this would preclude a major attack against II German Corps, simply becauseit would not result in a decisive victory. The Al<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ies could afford to lose almost the entire corpssector, reaching back to the French border, and they would still be ableto continue the war. Moreover, the mountainous terrain in this part ofGermany is not conducive to the movement of large armored forces. In thenorth, a major offensive against Schleswig-Holstein is unlikely. Althoughthe terrain is not mountainous in this sector there are still enough obstacles(bogs, rivers, urban sprawl around Hamburg) to hinder the movement of alarge armored force. Furthermore, a Pact success in this region would notconstitute a mortal blow to NATO. The main body of NATO's forces wouldstill be intact and capable of conducting a vigorous defense. </ITAG>[S17MY8-355]{S6008}channeling<ITAG tagnum="89">channeling forces: the pact's axes of attack in centag</ITAG>[S17MY8-356]{S6008}<ITAG tagnum="21">The Soviets are most likely to locate their main attacks along thefront stretching from the I Dutch Corps Sector in the north to the VIIAmerican Corps Sector in the south. Let us first consider the three keycorps sectors in CENTAG (III German, V U.S., and VII U.S.). Generally,the terrain in the CENTAG area is very<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>obstacle-ridden. Besides being a mountainous region,it has numerous rivers and forests. Consequently, there are a small numberof natural avenues of attack in CENTAG. Actually, there are three potentialaxes on which the Soviets are likely to attack. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The most threatening of the three possibilities would be an attackfrom the Thuringian Bulge through the Fulda Gap, aimed at Frankf<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rt (see F<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>gure 7). Except for the Fulda River, the terrainon this axis should not greatly hinder the movement of large armored forces.Importantly, this axis cuts across the ``wasp-waist'' or the narrowestsection of Germany. The distance from the inter-German border to <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Frankfurt<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> is a mere 100 km. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Frankfurt<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, because of its central location in Germany's communicationsnetwork, would be a most attractive target. Capturing <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Frankfurt<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> would effectively cut Germany in half, and giventhe importance of north-south lines of communication, would leave NATO'sforces in southern Germany isolated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The second potential axis of advance is located in the sector coveredby the III German Corps. The attacking forces would move through the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>GoandCx.174;4ttingen<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Corridor, just south of the Harz Mountains. Theindustrialized Ruhr is located due west of <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>GoandCx.174;4ttingen<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There is a third potential axis of advance in CENTAG, although itis less attractive than the axes which run through the Fulda Gap and the<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>GoandCx.174;4ttingen<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Corridor. This axis runs from Bohemia through thearea around the city of Hof toward Stuttgart: The Hof Corridor. The terrainthat an attacking force would have to traverse there is considerably moreobstacle-ridden tha<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the terrain along the other axes. Moreover, Stuttgartis a far less attractive target than either <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Frankfurt<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> or the Ruhr. Aside from these three axes, thereare no attractive alternatives. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">NATO's forces in CENTAG should be able to contain a major Soviet attackin this region. There are only a limited number of potential axes of advance,each of which is quite narrow and well defined and each of which NATO iswell prepared to defend. Moreover, NATO has contingency plans to shiftforces to combat Soviet efforts designed to achieve overwhelming forceratios at the points of main attack. NATO's prospect of successfully haltinga Soviet attack are further strengthened by the terrain, which not onlylimits the number of potential axes, but also channels the attacking forcesacross the width of Germany. In other words, the potential axes of advanceare rather narrow and do not allow the attacker to spread his forces afterthe initial breakthrough. </ITAG>[S17MY8-357]{S6008}the north <ITAG tagnum="89">the north german plain: open road for pact advance?</ITAG>[S17MY8-358]{S6008}<ITAG tagnum="21">Now, consider NATO's prospects for containing a Soviet attack directedagainst NORTHAG. It is widely held that NATO is more vulnerable in thisregion than in CENTAG. The terrain in NORTHAG, because it is not mountainousand covered with forests, is generally held to <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>be <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>more favorable to the movement of large armored formations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Secondly, there are doubts about whether the Dutch and the Belgians,and even the British, have the capability to withstand a Soviet attack.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Notwithstanding that NATO is more vulnerable in this region than inCENTAG, the prospects for thwarting a major Soviet attack in NORTHAG arequite good. The terrain is not obstacle-free by any means and, as willbecome clear, the Belgian and Dutch Corps Sectors are not the weak linksthat they are often said to be. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Approximately one-third of the front is covered by the Harz Mountains,while the terrain throughout the depth of the corps sector is laden withobstacles.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The North German Plain, above the Belgian Corps Sector, is coveredby <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>the<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I British and I German Corps. There is widespreadagreement that the Pact will place a single main axis against NORTHAG andthat the axis will be located on the North German Plain. Although thereare no mountains and few forests in this region, there are obstacles inboth the German and British Corps Sectors. In the British Corps Sector,there is significant urban sprawl centered on Hannover, which is locatedin the heart of this corps sector. Armored forces simply will not be ableto move rapidly through those urban </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">areas that NATO chooses to defend.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">``Finally, even if the attacking forces were able to penetrate throughthis sector rapidly, it is unlikely that NATO would be mortally wounded.Certainly, NATO would feel the loss of the ports in northern Germany. However,since the attacking forces would exit Germany into the northern part ofthe Netherlands, NATO would still have access to the most important Belgianand Dutch ports.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In sum, given the initial deployment patterns of both NATO and thePact, it appears that NATO is reasonably well deployed to meet a Sovietblitzkrieg. Although both Pact and NATO deployment patterns have been examined,attention has been focused, for the most part, on examining NATO's capabilityto thwart a blitzkrieg. Now let us shift the focus and examine, in detail,Soviet capabilities.  </ITAG>[S17MY8-359]{S6008}Soviet Cap<ITAG tagnum="89">Soviet Capabilities for Blitzkrieg Warfare  </ITAG>[S17MY8-360]{S6008}<ITAG tagnum="21">To ascertain whether the Soviet Army has the capacity to effect ablitzkrieg, it is necessary to ex<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>am<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ine that Army on three levels. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>F<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>irst, one must consider how the Soviet Army is organized.In other words, are the forces structured to facilitate a blitzkrieg? Second,it is necessary to consider doctrine, a subject that has already receivedsome attention. Finally, there is the matter of raw skill. Assuming thatthe problems with force structure and doctrine are minimal, is the SovietArmy capable of performing the assigned task?  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Since almost all the Pact divisions that would be used in a Europeanwar are either armored or mechanized infantry, it seems reasonable to assumethat the Pact is appropriately organized to launch a blitzkrieg. On closeinspection, however, there are potential trouble spots in the Pact's forcestructure. Over the past decade, Soviet divisions have become extremelyheavy units. Western analysts pay a great deal of attention to the largeand growing number of tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, artillery pieces,rocket launchers, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>surface-to-air<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> missiles, air defense guns, anti-tank guided missiles(ATGMs), and assorted other weapons that are found in Soviet as well asother Pact divis<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ons. Past a certain point, however, there is an inverserelationship between the mass and the velocity of an attacking force. Asthe size of the attacking force increases, the logistical problems as wellas the command and control problems increase proportionately. Then, itbecomes very difficult to move that force rapidly_an essential requirementfor a blitzkrieg, where the attacker is seeking to strike deep into thedefender's rear before the defender can shift forces to deal with the penetratingforces.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Consider now the matter of doctrine. As noted earlier, it is not possibleto determine exactly how the Soviets plan to fight a conventional war inEurope. This is becaus<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the Soviets themselves are not sure; there is presentlydoctrinal uncertainty in their military circles. Certainly, they continueto emphasize the necessity of rapidly defeating NATO, should a war in Europebreak out. The Soviets reconcile, however, that it is becoming increasinglydifficult to do this, especially because of the proliferation of ATGMs.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Moreover, they are well aware of how these organizationalproblems compound their task.

The key question is: can the Soviets exploit suchopportunities before NATO, which is well prepared for such an eventuality,shuts the door? In this battle, the crucial determinant will not be howmuch firepower the Soviets have amassed for the breakthrough; succeesswill be largely the result of highly skilled officers and NCOs making thedecis<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ons that will enable the armored spearheads to outrunNATO's defenses. A blitzkrieg depends on split-second timing since opportunityon the battlefield is so fleeting.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There is substantial evidence that Soviet officers and <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>NCOs<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> are sadly lacking in individual initiative, andfurthermore, that the Soviet command structure is rigid.    </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Their absence is largely the result of powerful historical forces.Fundamental structural change in Soviet society and the Soviet militarywould be necessary before there would be any significant increase in flexibilityand initiative.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other deficiencies in the Soviet Army cast doubt on the Soviets' capacityto launch a successful blitzkrieg. For example, the Soviets have significantproblems with training. Overreliance on training aids and simulators isa factor often cited, and there is widespread feeling that the trainingprocess does not satisfactorily appro<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ximate<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> actual combat conditions. Training is of specialimportance for the Soviets since their army is comprised largely of conscriptswho serve a mere two years. Moreover, since new conscripts are trainedin actual combat units, more than half of the troops in the 19 Soviet divisionsin East Germany are soldiers with less than two years of experience. Atany one time, a significant number of those troops is either untrainedor partially trained. It should also be noted that Soviet soldiers aredeficient in map reading, a skill which is of much importance for an armyattempting to launch a blitzkrieg.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, one must consider the capabilities of the non-Soviet divisions,which comprise approximately half of the Pact's 57\1/2\ standing divisions.Although the Soviet divisions will certainly perform the critical tasksin any offensive, the non-Soviet divisions will have to play a role inthe operation. Otherwise, the size of the offensive would have to be scaleddown significantly. One cannot say with any degree of certainty that theEast Europeans would be militarily incapable<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> of<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> performing their assigned task or that they wouldnot commit themselves politically to supporting a Soviet-led offensive.The Soviets, however, would have to give serious consideration to the reliabilityof the East Europeans.</ITAG>[S17MY8-363]{S6009}conclusion<ITAG tagnum="89">conclusion</ITAG>[S17MY8-364]{S6009}<ITAG tagnum="21">Even if one were to discount these wea<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>k<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nesses of the Soviet Army, the task of quickly overrunningNATO's defenses would be very formidable one. A Pact offensive would haveto traverse the obstacle-ridden terrain which covers almost all of Germanyand restricts the movement of large armored units. Moreover, there is goodreason to believe that NATO has the wherewithal to thwart such an offensive.In short, NATO is in relatively good shape at the conventional level.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Two very important caveats, however, are in order. First, NATO mustprovide for the continuation of ongoing improvements in its force structure.There is no evidence that the Soviet effort to modernize her forces inCentral Europe is slowing down. Therefore, NATO must continue to make improvementsif it is to maint<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ain<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the present balance. It is absolutely essential,for example, that deployment of the American Corps in NORTHAG be completed.It is also imperative that the Belgians, the British, and the Dutch continueto modernize and upgrade their conventional forces. More specifically,these forces, especially the British, must increase the firepower of theirindividual brigades. And, the Allie<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> need to place more emphasis on improving the sustainabilityof their forces.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Fortunately, the conventional wisdom is wrong; NATO presently hasthe capability to thwart a Soviet attack. Unfortunately, too few peoplerecognize this. The second cavea<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> concerns warning time and mobilization. Given NATO'spresent intelligence capabilities and the Pact's force structure, thereis little doubt that NATO would detect a full-scale Pact mobilization almostimmediately. Obviously, NATO must ensure that it maintains this capability.Problems arise, however, in circumstances where the Pact pursues a limitedmobilization which is somewhat difficult to gauge. Although ther<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> are real limits as to how much mobilization theSoviets can achieve before tipping their hand, NATO needs to be especiallysensitive to such an eventuality. Moreover, NATO must be prepared to respondto a limited mobilization, even if the evidence of such a mobilizationis somewhat ambiguous. This leads to the critical problem of mobilization.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This article highlights how important it is that NATO mobilize itsforces immediately after the Pact begins its mobilization. A favorablebalance of forces in a crisis will be a function of political as well asmilitary factors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The real danger is that NATO's leaders will not agree to mobilizein a crisis for fear that such a move might provoke a Soviet attack. Therisk of pushing the Soviets to preempt can be reduced, however, by avoidingcertain provocative moves and by clearly communicating one's intentionsto the other side. Nevertheless, the risk of provoking a Soviet attackby initiating NATO mobilization can never be completely erased. That risk,however, must be weighed against the far greater danger that if NATO doesnot mobilize, the capability to defend against a Pact attack will be lost.Moreover, once the Pact achieves a decisive superiority because of NATO'sfailure to mobilize, it would be not only difficult, but very dangerousfor NATO to attempt to redress the balance with a tardy mobilization. Seeingthat process set into motion, the Pact would have a very strong incentiveto attack before NATO erased its advantage. In short, it is essential thatNATO plan for ways to mobilize that do not provoke a Soviet attack, but,at the same time, ensure that NATO does not lose its present capabilityto defend itself effectively against a Soviet offensive.</ITAG>[S17MY8-365]{S6009}death to d<ITAG tagnum="89">death to drug king pins</ITAG>[S17MY8-366]{S6009}MIKULSKIMs. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for thequorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. <T4>Fowler</T4>). Without objection, it is so ordered. [S17MY8-475]{S6014}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, the agreement was that the first 17 articles ofthe treaty would be read down to the signatories, at which time the readingof the treaty would be temporarily held in abeyance with all rights reservedto Senators in the hopes that during that time of reading the first 17articles, Senators who were working on an agreement anent the D'Amato amendmentmight be able to reach such an agreement so that the Senate then coulddispose of the Department of Defense authorization bill. Senators are still working on such an agreement and will not be able toconclude that agreement until tomorrow morning at a time when Senator <T4>Kennedy </T4>will be here. He is very much involved in that amendmentand he cannot come to the Chamber this afternoon. So we are at the point now where we either have to continue with the readingof the protocols, which will take several hours, or we dispense with furtherreading of the protocols and perhaps get on with our opening statements.The Senator from North Carolina is on the floor. He did not raise an objection,but he was in a position to raise an objection, to the calling off of thereading of the treaty at the end of the 1 hour, or such time as was requiredto read the 17 sections. So I would like to proceed now, if we could, todispense with the further reading of the protocols. I will inquire of the distinguished Senator if he has any objection. Asa matter of fact, I will ask unanimous consent for the record, that furtherreading of the treaty be dispensed with. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I have no desireto keep the Senate here tonight to read the protocols. On top of that,I talked to the clerk. He is getting a little raspy in his delivery andhis Russian is not all that good, and a lot of this is in Russian.But I would inquire of the majority leader if he would include in his unanimous<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>consent request that all rights are protected. Imay have a couple point<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of order which I will want to raise at the appropriatetime.

All right. As I understand it, the distinguished Senator wouldnot object to calling off the further reading of the_we will use the word``treaty''_further reading of the treaty and its attending protocols, providedno rights are waived thereby. [S17MY8-478]{S6014}HELMSMr. HELMS. Correct.[S17MY8-479]{S6014}BYRDMr. BYRD. Which leaves with every Senator any points of order that he otherwisemight wish to raise at this particular point.[S17MY8-480]{S6014}HELMSMr. HELMS. Well, it is a little bit ticklish about the timing of this,according to my understanding of the rules. But the distinguished majorityleader would know more about that.In any case, just so my rights are protected in that regard, that is fine.[S17MY8-481]{S6014}BYRDMr. BYRD. Let me word the request like this and see if it meets with theapproval of the Senator.Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the treatybe dispensed with, provided that the rights of all Senators are preserved;that no points of order are waived for the remainder of today and up tothe point of tomorrow's beginning on the treaty by virtue of this consentrequest.This would mean that whatever rights the Senator has or any Senator hasat this point would still be preserved to that Senator or any Senator upto and including the moment that the Senate resumes consideration of thetreaty tomorrow. So he is in the same position tomorrow morning as he isright now. But this would allow us to dispense with the further readingof the treaty and get on with it. Some of us want to make opening statementstoday.And if the Senator wanted in the morning to insist upon further readingof the protocols, he could do that. He could do it right now. This preserveshis right for the next several hours until the Senate resumes considerationof the treaty on tomorrow.[S17MY8-482]{S6014}HELMSMr. HELMS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, it seems to me thatthe majority leader has made it abundantly clear and I have no objectionwhatsoever.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, the unanimous-consent requestis agreed to.[S17MY8-483]{S6014}BYRDMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from North Carolina.Now, I will make this proposal to the distinguished Republican leader thatfor the remainder of the day_and we will not be able to settle the situationconcerning the D'Amato amendment until tomorrow morning. The only thingwe can accomplish the rest of the day is to get some opening statementsout of the way on the treaty. I would suggest that we equally divide thetime for the remainder of this day and that we let the distinguished <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>R<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>epublic<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>an<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> leader and the majority leader control the time,or their designees. I will yield most of the time to Mr. <T4>Pell</T4> for the remainder of the day. This would preclude any amendmentfrom being called up today. We might proceed on that basis for the restof the day.[S17MY8-484]{S6014}EXONMr. EXON. Would the majority leader yield for <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>question?[S17MY8-485]{S6014}BYRDMr. BYRD. Yes, I would be happy to.[S17MY8-486]{S6014}EXONMr. EXON. Does the majority leader anticipate rollcall votes this afternoon?Or have you mentioned that? For the rest of the day?[S17MY8-487]{S6014}BYRDMr. BYRD. That is a very good question.

The Senator from Rhode Island.[S17MY8-490]{S6014}PELLMr. PELL. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I need.Madam President, I am very pleased that the Senate is now in position tobegin consideration of the treaty between the United States of Americaand the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the elimination of theirintermediate-range and shorter<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>range missiles. This treaty, known as the INF Treaty, was signed by President Reagan andthe Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, on December 8, 1987, here in Washington.The treaty, together with two protocols and a memorandum of understandingwas transmitted to the Senate on January 25, 1988. The Committee on ForeignRelations held a comprehensive series of 29 hearings in January, February,and early March, and heard testimony from more than 50 witnesses. On March30, 1988, the committee ordered the resolution of ratification, as amendedby a condition, reported favorably by a 17<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-to-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>2 vote. Prior to its markup, the Committee on Foreign Relations received a reportfrom the Committee on Armed Services concerning the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>reaty's effect on NATO defense and from the SelectCommittee on Intelligence on the U.S. ability to monitor and verify treatycompliance. The reports were helpful to the Committee on Foreign Relationsin reaching its overall judgment that the treaty would serve the nationalinterests of the United States and should be ratified. After the treaty was reported, certain issues related to paricular rightsand obligations of the parties arose during U.S.-Soviet talks on treatyimplementation. Administration officials worked with the Senate in determininghow best to resolve these issues and consulted on numerous occasions withthe Soviet side. Secretary of State Shultz met with Soviet Foreign MinisterShevardnadze on May 11 and 12 in Geneva to gain final clarifications beforethe full Senate took up the treaty. The Secretary reported to the Committeeon Foreign Relations on May 16, and I am happy to report that the issuesappear to have been resolved in a manner satisfactory to the United States.Thus, it is appropriate that the Senate now proceed. Madam President, the INF Treaty requires that the United States and theSoviet Union: Eliminate all ground-launched intermediate-range (1,000-5,000 kilometers)missiles and launchers in phases over three years; Eliminate all shorter-range (500-1,000 kilometers) ground-launched missilesand launchers within 18 months; and Not produce, flight-test, or possess such systems for the indefinite durationof the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>reaty. Under the terms of the treaty, the United States will eliminate 120 deployedand 127 non-deployed Pershing II ballistic missiles, for a total of 247.The United States will eliminate 309 deployed ground-launched cruise missilesand 133 non-deployed GLCM's, for a total of 442. Taking both types together,the United States will eliminate 689 intermediate-range missiles. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union will eliminate a somewhat greater number ofintermediate-range missiles, as follows: 405 deployed SS-20's, 245 non-deployedSS-20's, 65 deployed SS-4's, 105 non-deployed SS-4's and six SS-5 missiles,for a total of 826. In the shorter-range category, the United States will eliminate 170 Pershing1A missiles now in storage. The Soviet Union will eliminate 220 deployedand 506 non-deployed SS-12's and 22's, and 167 deployed and 33 non-deployedSS-23's, for a total of 926. In terms of deployed warheads, the asymmetry is even greater. The UnitedStates will take out a warhead for each deployed missile for a total of429, and the Soviet Union will take out three warheads for each deployedSS-20 and one warhead for each of its other deployed intermediate-rangeand shorter-range missiles for a total of 1,667. This constitutes a four-to-onedisparity in favor of the United States in terms of deployed nuclear warheads.  Under the terms of the treaty and the protocol on eliminations, the eliminationprocess will be tightly controlled. Allowable locations of missiles andlaunchers to be eliminated are carefully specified, and systems must beeliminated in complete units, support structures must be eliminated wherethey stand, and destruction must occur only to agreed facilities. Duringthe first 6 months a maximum of 100 intermediate-range missiles may beeliminated by launching. The two sides made an extensive and unprecedenteddata exchange as of November 1, 1987, and updated information is to beprovided within 30 days of entry into force and at 6-month intervals thereafter.In monitoring compliance, national technical means, which includes satelliteand other collection assets, will be crucial. The parties have not onlyagreed not to interfere with each other's NTM but also to take specificsteps to enhance each side's ability to monitor compliance by NTM. In addition,there is provision for on-site inspections, including base-line, close-out,elimination, and short-notice inspections, as well as portal monitoringof a missile assembly plant on each side.I find the strong verification provisions are reassuring. Clearly, we wouldbe able to detect and react in time to any militarily significant violations,and there is reason for confidence that any such violations would be detectedthrough our national technical means. At the same time, the committee wasalert to the danger that excessive verification requirements might haveled to a treaty which fell short of its potential. We concluded that agood balance was struck and that the treaty is a solid accord with effectiveverification.Having reached these judgments, the committee concluded that the treatywarranted approval without change. At the same time, the committee judgedit crucially important that one formal condition be adopted. This conditionaffirms certain constitutional principles related to the treaty power andr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>quires that these principles govern U.S. interpretationof the INF Treaty. The purpose of the condition is to reaffirm the long-standingpractice and long-standing principle that the current ``shared understanding''of the Executive and the Senate, as reflected in the Executive's formalrepresentations, is defining in terms of the President's future latitudein interpreting and implementing the treaty. Given recent administrationassertions to the contrary, the committee judged that, in the absence ofsuch a condition, the Senate would face the alternative of consideringcountless other conditions designed to formalize the Senate's understandingof various INF Treaty provisions.Madam President, the Committee on Foreign Relations questioned administrationand other witnesses closely on this treaty. We weighed the merits carefully,and we looked for flaws as well. We would not have supported this treatyif it <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>j<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eopardized U.S. security in any way.Madam President, the INF Treaty comes to the Senate after more than 7 yearsin which there have been no formal accomplishments in the arms controlarena. Of course, that alone is not sufficient justification for approvalof the treaty. But the treaty's substantive merits do provide such justification.With the Foreign Relations Committee having studied the treaty carefully,I welcome the opportunity to state that the committee has given its imprimaturto this arms control achievement.I hope that the Senate will move to approve the INF Treaty promptly andthat we will not become bogged down in the consideration of unnecessaryconditions and amendments. If we understand that the INF Treaty is a modestachievement in military terms and a more important success in politicalterms, I believe we will be able to put the treaty in the right perspective.The treaty, in my view, is most important as the beginning of a new continuumin arms control that could lead us to further and quite significant achievements.The treaty could be followed by verification agreements which opened theway to ratification of the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty. It could help open the way to successin Geneva in negotiating a solid, comprehensive START treaty, which wouldbe of great military significance by requiring deep cuts in the strategicweapons possessed by the United States and the Soviet Union. With regardto Europe, the treaty could set the stage for success in reaching agreementto sharply reduce the threat posed by the Warsaw Pact's conventional forces.Such successes could be enhanced by an early agreement on a chemical weaponsban.We should bear in mind that the INF Treaty is of little military significance.Only 5 percent or 1/20th of the total number of deployed nuclear weaponsis being removed. And every targeted military or civilian site that isno longer targeted as a result of the removal of the nuclear weapons coveredby the treaty may, if the opposing side wishes, be retargeted by sea orair-based missiles, as well as land-based intercontinental ballistic missilesnot covered by the treaty.The importance of this treaty is political and psychological_to signala stop to the nuclear arms race, a halt to the present continuous up<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>w<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ard escalation of Soviet and American nuclear weapons.It would start a momentum downward, not upward.When that is accomplished, it would be time to consider the next stageof negotiations, which should be participated in by all nuclear weaponsnations. To reach that stage, we must be serious and dedicated now.The INF Treaty represents a small, but vitally importan<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> step toward successes which could get us back ontrack in the search for far more substantial arms reductions. I urge thatthe Senate proceed expeditiously to approve the INF Treaty.I invite to the attention of my colleagues that this treaty is of immensepsychological and political importance, a good forward step; as Bob Kennedyonce put it, ``The journey of a thousand miles starts with a simple step.''And this step could hopefully reverse the present flow of escalation andincreasing numbers of nuclear weapons.I yield the floor.[S17MY8-491]{S6016}BYRDMr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield me some time?[S17MY8-492]{S6016}PELLMr. PELL. Certainly. I yield such time as he may need to the majority leader.[S17MY8-493]{S6016}BYRDMr. BYRD. I thank my distinguished friend.Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for debate todayon the treaty be limited to 2 hours to be equally divided between the minorityleader and myself. The distinguished Republican leader and I have discussedjust a few moments ago the amount of time we would proceed for the restof the day with the understanding that the time can be extended but fornow that we might have a backdrop on the amount of time that we expectto take we begin with 2 hours. Is that agreeable? I make that request.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is soordered.[S17MY8-494]{S6016}BYRDMr. BYRD. Madam President, the treaty between the United Stat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republicsis before the Senate, and it has to do with the elimination of the intermediate-rangeand shorter-range missiles, together with the memorandum of understandingand two protocols thereto, collectively referred to as the INF Treaty.This is the subject matter before the Senate as of now. It is a treatyof great importance to our Nation and to this body for a number of reasons.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t is the result of a long, difficult confrontationwith our primary adversary since the end of World War II_the Soviet Union_whichtook the form of a mili<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ta<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ry challenge to the NATO alliance in the 1970's<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> in a provocative deployment of Soviet medium-rangeballistic missiles targeted at European capitals.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>he deployment was a form of intimidation designedto break the will of the Atlantic alliance, to divide and conquer Europeancountries. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>his treaty, first and foremost, is proof positivethat the Soviet strategy h<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s not worked. It is proof positive that Americanleadership of a strong united alliance has worked over the span of twoadministrations, one Democratic and one Republican.This treaty is, to a large extent, a European treaty, since none of theweapons which will be eliminated by the treaty are capable of reachingthe <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ontinental United States, with the exception of thoseAsian-based SS-20's capable of reaching portions of Alaska. Therefore,it was important that it be satisfactory to the European<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, and that they be consulted as it was being negotiated.I commen<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the administration for a successful effort in thisregard. I led a bipartisan delegation of Senators to<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> five NAT<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>O capitals in February_a delegation composed of thethree committee chairm<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n who th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>oro<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ughly investigated and explored the provisions ofthis treaty<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and who are to be commended, along with Mr. <T4>Warner, </T4>who is not only ranking on the Armed Services Committeebut also sits on the Intelligence Committee and has had a very importantand re<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>sp<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>onsible role in this process.I refer, of course, to those chairmen_Senator <T4>Pell,</T4> Senator <T4>Nunn,</T4> and Senator <T4>Boren</T4>_of the Committees on Foreign Relations, Armed Services,and Intelligence, respectively.I then testified before the Foreign Relations Committee on the resultsof our trip on February 24, 1988, and have submitted, on behalf of thedelegation a comprehensive report on our trip to the Senate on March 12,1988.I include a copy of that report in the <T4>Record</T4> at the conclusion of my remarks.We found that there was widespread support for the treaty among our NATOpartners, and as the report concludes, ``On the narrow question of ratificationon the INF <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>T<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>reaty, opinion was virtually unanimous that it shouldbe approved by the Senate for ratification, and that failure to ratifycould create a grave crisis in Western Europe and NATO.''Nevertheless, there was also a consensus that only sound agreements shouldbe concluded by the United States with the Soviets. There was a consensusthat we have to be careful that the momentum of good publicity sur<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ounding signing ceremonies, portrayed in the sophisticatedpublicity campaigns of the new Soviet leadership does not create a falsemomentum toward agreements that are not carefully negotiated and concludedwith our security interests uppermost in our consideration. The reportconcluded that, in NATO, there was a ``clear consensus that arms controlagreements, including a START agreement, should be concluded when issuesin dispute have been satisfactorily negotiated, and should not be negotiatedunder the pressure of artificial deadlines.``Likewise, when and if a sound agreement is in sight, there should beno delay in concluding it, since to do so is in our common interest. Butthe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mportant thing is that it be a good agreement_notdictated by <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>calendar<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> deadlines or election year politics.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>''<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>We have seen in connection with this treaty, which is rather minor in comparisonwith the START agreement, that there have been problems, there have beenloose end<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, there have been matters that have not been thoroughlygone into, some of which were not even discussed or brought up by our negotiators.And because of the insistence of this Senate on a thorough understandingof what we were doing and where we were going before we jumped, the insistenceof this Senate on the part of its committees, it led the way that our negotiatorsgo back and resolve these differences and disputes and disagreements withthe Soviets before the Senate began debating on the floor the full treaty.As a result of the position that the Senate has taken in that regard, ofcourse, General Powe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ll<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> has indicated that in his opinion the process greatlyenhanced and advanced the security interests of the United States.So with that lesson in min<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> before them<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> I hope that our negotiators, when they sit downwith the Soviets to discuss the START agreement, will clearly rememberthat this is no pushover, this Senate, and that it is an inst<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tution that under the Constitution has a role, animportant role, one that is not a symbolic role, one that is not a rubberstamprole to any President, <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>b<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ut one which is a role that protects the interestsof the American people. And this Senate has demonstrated in this case thatit will not be an <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nstitutio<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> that will just roll over and play dead, but it meansto have its say and it means to take a good look at any agreement. Andwe also keep in mind that we are de<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>al<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ing with the Soviet Union.So it might also be a good lesson to the Soviets that under this system,under the American system, there is no single individual in this societyor in this Government who has all power, and that this is a system of tripartitepowers and equal and separate branches. So it may be a good civics lesson for our friends in Moscow as well asthey look toward possibly <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>iscussions that might at some point ultimately leadto another agreement, START agreement. It might also be a matter of considerable solace and comfort to our alliesto know that there is a Senate, that there really is a S<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>nate, and that it is just not an institution in name.It is an institution that takes very seriously those wor<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s that were written into the Constitution by ourforefathers and believes that those words wer<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>just not put in to fill ou<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> sentences or pages in the Constitutio<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. So our allies can depend on this Senate as well in protecting their interests,the allies' interests, as long as treaties are entered into that involvethe security of the allies.The important thing is, as we see it, that this be a good agreement, notdictated by calendar deadlines or election year politics.Mr. President, this conclusion applies to the way in which this Senateconducts its review of treaties. I would point out that recent historyis very mixed, and rather disappointing on the question of arms controltreaties. We have not considered a major arms control treaty on this floorsince the ABM Treaty was approved in 1972. Less than 20 percent of theSenators now sitting in this body have participated in such an importantexercise. In fact, the distinguished minority leader and I were so concernedabout the history of arms control and the Senate's role in arms controlthat we created a special Senate body, the arms control observer group,as the major item of Senate business on the first day of the last Congress,the 99th Congress, on January 3, 1985. As we said in our report to the Senate at that time, ``We seek to avoida recurrence of the problems of the 1970's, when three successive armscontrol treaties, signed by three Presidents, were never approved for ratificationby the Senate_including two nuclear testing treaties and the SALT II Treaty.''I believe the functioning and existence of that group<ITAG tagnum="80">has been of value to this Senate, and to the three committees, andI commend the work of the leadership of that group, Senators </ITAG><T4>Pell, Nunn, Lugar, </T4>and <T4>Stevens</T4>.Overall, we must be thorough. We have already learned that lesson in spadeson this INF Treaty. Both the Armed Services and Intelligence Committeesfound gaps, loopholes, and ambiguities in this treaty which had to be clearedup_which had to be clarified with the Soviet Union. This was the case mostnotably on the issue of future weapons systems and whether they are clearlybanned by the treaty. It was also the case on the matter of some problemswhich arose on the novel, unique, on-site verification system which isbeing created by this treaty.The Foreign Relations Committee reported this treaty favorably on April14, 1988. In the days since that report, substantial improvements havebeen made, including negotiations with the Soviet Union on the verificationprocedures of the treaty. The thoroughness of the Senate regarding thistreaty has already paid dividends to the Nation. It is my hope and my expectationthat the careful consideration of the full Senate on this floor will enhancethe <CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="80"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>value of this treaty further for our Nation.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> </ITAG><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Madam President, the result of these efforts throughoutthe Senate is that we are now prepared to move to the important and criticalfinal step of Senate action: debate on the treaty and the resolution ofratification on the floor of the Senate.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I expect the debate here on the floor will be thorough,and there will undoubtedly be amendments, offered, debated<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and voted upon. These are important matters andthey deserve the careful attention of the Senate. I hope that all Senatorswill devote time and energy to be here to participate in this importantdebate. I hope that the quality of the debate will serve to inform theAmerican people and to reassure them about the thoroughness of the procedureby which this Senate approaches this extremely important, and why not saycritical matter. I intend to, and at the moment it is my intention to supportconsent to the ratification <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>of<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the INF Trea<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>y. I believe it passes the critical test which isthat it enhances the security of the United States, and it is a list, andthat it is in the interest of NATO to ratify the treaty. Several issuesare likely to attract considerable attention in coming days. The ForeignRelations Committee has reported a resolution of ratification with a suggestedcondition on treaty interpretation. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Such a condition is necessary, in my view, in light of our experience overthe past 2 years with the issue of treaty interpretation. In light of theinsistence by parts of the administration that testimony by administrationofficials is not authoritative in the interpretation of provisions of atreaty, and that only the classified negotiating record is authoritative,we had to arrange for the administration to provide us with the entirenegotiating record. We established a s<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>p<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rate office, the Arms Control Treaty Review SupportOffice, which has exhaustively evaluated that record, developed a sophisticatedcomputer program to evaluate that record, so that comparisons could bemade by the committees of that record with the testimony being providedby administration officials. The system has worked well, and sets an importantprecedent for consideration of future treaties.I also bel<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ie<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ve it will be necessary to attach a binding conditionconcerning the issue of future technologies. As a result of the exchangeof notes in Geneva last week, the two sides have now clearly stated theircommon understanding that the INF Treaty bans all intermediate-range andshorter-range missiles, regardless of the type of weapons they ca<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ry. This understanding should have equal status withthe other elements of the treaty, in my opinion, and I will support a conditionon the resolution of ratification which binds the two sides to this statement.I believe this is an important treaty, dealing with important issues whichcritically affect the security of ourselves<ITAG tagnum="80">and our allies. It is not, in my opinion, militarily insignificantor a minor matter. The treaty breaks new ground by requiring the completeelimination of classes of weapons, by requiring an intrusive inspectionand verification system, and in the degree of cooperation required frombasing countries and allies in implementing the treaty.</ITAG>Madam President, I hope the treaty can be approved without attaching additionalconditions on policy and on United States-Soviet relations which are notdirectly related to the treaty itself and the matters it covers.Like other Senators, I have a number of concerns about Soviet behaviorin various parts of the world. We all know that their invasion of Afghanistanand the bloody 8-year war in that country was devastating to the last armscontrol treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union and, as amatter of fact, was a deciding factor that prevented that treaty from beingcalled up by the then majority leader, myself, for debate and action onthis floor.When the Soviets went into Afghanistan in the summer of 1979, that, ofcourse, was the straw that broke the treaty's back, and I never calledup that treaty.As I indicated to Mr. Gorbachev when he was in this city a few weeks back,in the presence of other Senators, it would be very helpful when we considerthis treaty if we could have a timetable on the withdrawal of Soviet forcesfrom Afghanistan.It was my intention at that time to have several days of debate on Afghanistanduring consideration of this treaty and to attach some reservation or declarationor understanding or statement of some kind that would put the Senate ina strong position with respect to advocating the withdrawal of the Sovietsfrom Afghanistan.<ITAG tagnum="80">The Soviets have now established and publicized a timetable for theirremoval, and I commend the administration, and in particular I commendSecretary of State Shultz. Because of the fact that that timetable hasnow been publicly established, the debate on this treaty will be much shorterthan it otherwise would have been. </ITAG>I do not have in mind anything by <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>way<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of any reservation that I will seek to attach tothe treaty, and I do not have in mind any long debate, so far as I am concerned,in that regard. But that was certainly a very forward step taken by Mr.Gorbachev, and it saved a lot of the Senate's time in the deliberationson this treaty. So it is a hopeful sign that as we take up this INF Treaty, the Sovietshave decided to acknowledge their failure to subjugate that brave countryand those brave people who believe in freedom, who put freedom above theirlives, and the Soviets are beginning to withdraw. I encourage the Senate to thoroughly examine and debate the treaty itself,and not go too far afield into other policy areas that can be debated onother vehicles, because we must remember that, after all, we are debatingan arms control treaty. I hope we will try to stay as close as we can tothat subject matter. I want to commend the Republican leader for the support he has given tothe imperative that the Senate fulfill its proper role in connection withthe approval and ratification of treaties. I also commend, once again, the chairmen of the Committees on Foreign Relations,Armed Services, and Intelligence, and the ranking members thereof. I know that perhaps one ranking member of those three committees is notwholly supportive of the treaty. Nevertheless, he is fulfilling his responsibilityas he sees it.

Accompanying me on the delegation were the leaders of the threecommittees with responsibilities for aspects of the Intermediate-RangeNuclear Forces (INF) Treaty: Senator Claiborne Pell, Chairman, Committeeon Foreign Relations, the committee with jurisdiction over the Treaty;Senator Sam Nunn, Chairman, Committee on Armed Services; Senator John W.Warner, Ranking Member, Committee on Armed Services; and Senator DavidL. Boren, Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The purpose of the trip was to hold consultations and discussionswith government leaders, opposition politicians, and leading figures fromacademia and the media in key NATO countries, focusing on the INF Treatyand its significance for the future of the NATO Alliance. At the time ofthe trip, all three committees were in the process of holding hearingson aspects and implications of the Treaty. President Reagan signed theTreaty with the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, on December 8, 1987,in Washington, D.C., and submitted it to the Senate for its advice andconsent to ratification on January 25, 1988. Since the United States, inessence, negotiated this Treaty with the Soviet Union on behalf of theNATO Alliance, the Senate leadership deemed it important to seek directlyEuropean leaders' views and advice as an integral part of the process ofreviewing the Treaty.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At the outset of the trip, the delegation attended the 25th annualInternational Wehrkunde Meeting in Munich, Federal Republic of Germany,the theme of which was ``The American-Russian Disarmament Negotiationsand their Consequences.'' At this conference, a sizable representationof officials from all NATO countries, as well as opinion-makers and outsideexperts, were gathered. Both Senator Nunn and I delivered addresses tothat gathering, which are included in this report as Appendices A and B.The delegation had an opportunity to hear a variety of informed opinionsas to the future security needs of and challenges for the Alliance. Followingthat conference, the delegation traveled to London, Bonn, Paris, Ankara,and Rome. In each capital, it met the head of state or of government. Additionally,it met with the defense and foreign ministers at each stop, oppositionleaders, and opinion-makers, as well as with both foreign and Americanpress representatives.

By following through on the 1979 dual track decision to deployground-launched cruise missiles and Pershing II ballistic missiles while,at the same time, pursuing discussions of limits on those missiles, theAlliance has achieved a great victory. This victory was not achieved withoutconsiderable courage and the expenditure of political capital by leadersin each of the NATO countries. Through courage and farsightedness, NATOwas able to reaffirm the principles that the Alliance will take whateversteps are necessary for its own security, and that its members will standtogether in pursuit of these common objectives.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Inevitably, the attainment of the Alliance objective of total eliminationof these systems through asymmetrical reductions opens the agenda for thenext set of decisions which must be addressed. Therefore, this delegationfocused on the challenges and decisions facing NATO in the post-INF era,rather than solely on the question of treaty ratification. The Allianceas a whole is to be commended for the victory in attaining the treaty,but this is not a time for excessive self-satisfaction or relaxation. Instead,a healthy period of reexamination, assessment, and planning for the Alliancefuture is in order. The leaders with whom the delegation met shared thisview.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This Congressional delegation visited NATO capitals at a time of reneweddebate and discussion regarding the Alliance's purposes and future directions.Although the treaty on Intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) representsa victory for Alliance cohesion and steadfastness in pursuing a commonpolicy, it also represents the end of a ten-year phase during which INFwas at the core of Alliance efforts in arms control and force modernization.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At this time, the full Senate is considering the INF Treaty and itis hoped that this report will provide useful perspectives on the issueswhich form the larger international context for the accord. Finally, thedelegation notes with appreciation the preparation of this report by RichardD'Amato, Scott Harris, and Wendy Deker.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="57">Robert C. Byrd, </ITAG><T3>Majority Leader, </T3><ITAG tagnum="58">Delegation Chairman.</ITAG>[S17MY8-506]{S6018}INTRODUCTI<ITAG tagnum="74"/><T2>INTRODUCTION </T2><ITAG tagnum="21">The delegation embarked on the visit with three objectives. The firstof these was to receive firsthand the unfiltered views of the leaders ofthe alliance regarding the INF Treaty. Given the significance of this treatyfor European security and for the continued unity of NATO, views of theEuropean Allies constitute an important factor to be taken into accountduring the Senate's consideration of this treaty. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A second objective was to discuss, not only with government officialsbut with opposition leaders and private citizens as well, the impact ofthe treaty on the future of NATO. The Alliance will face crucial, and potentiallycontroversial, decisions in the post-INF political and military environments.In the opinion of the delegation, it is important to begin now to considerthese issues and to begin to formulate a common course. In particular,it is important that NATO identify a common set of objectives for the nextround of arms control, particularly in the area of conventional arms reductions.Many useful suggestions in this regard were identified during the courseof the delegation's discussions with European leaders. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The third objective of the delegation's visit was to explore withEuropean counterparts their perceptions of the objectives and style ofSoviet policy toward the West, particularly the impact of Soviet diplomacyon Western public opinion. Is there a generalized perception that the threatto Western security has diminished, or that NATO's strategy of deterrencebased on the capability for flexible response is no longer widely supported?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition to the mission of listening to European views and learningabout the trends of European public opinion, the delegation also conveyedto interested European audiences, in public as well as private sessions,a message concerning the U.S. commitment to NATO and the inherent stabilityof the American political system. Particularly in an election year, whenthe level of political rhetoric and debate could convey confused and conflictingimages of the United States to Europeans, the fact that the Senate of theUnited States is a continuing body is worth recalling and emphasizing.Moreover, the members of the delegation focused on the essential factsthat the INF Treaty is a victory for NATO unity and cohesion, and that,regardless of the debate over ratification which will ensue in the comingweeks, it is highly likely that the Senate will consent to the Treaty'sratification. For that reason, it is important for NATO to begin now tolook beyond the specifics of the INF Treaty and to focus on future challenges.</ITAG>[S17MY8-507]{S6019}A. Context<ITAG tagnum="74">A. Context: Background Themes of the Visit </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Several developments related either to the INF Treaty or to politicaltrends in Europe occurred during the time of the delegation's visit. Theyprovided important background themes, the essential context in which thediscussions in Europe took place.   </ITAG>[S17MY8-508]{S6019}a. inf tre<ITAG tagnum="89"><CODE-213>5</CODE-213></ITAG><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>a. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>inf treaty interpretation </T4>[S17MY8-509]{S6019}<ITAG tagnum="21">Most visible of these background developments was the ongoing controversyover future interpretation by the executive branch of the INF Treaty, acontroversy which stems from the efforts of the Reagan Administration toreinterpret the ABM Treaty in a manner different from its traditional interpretation.The possibility of delays in Senate consideration of the INF Treaty asa result of the dispute between the Senate and the Administration overwhether Administration testimony as to the meaning of the Treaty wouldbe authoritative and binding in the future received considerable attentionduring the trip. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Senators Byrd, Pell, Nunn and Boren engaged Secretary Shultz and AmbassadorsKampelman and Nitze in an extensive discussion of this issue in the weeksleading up to the delegation's departure, without reaching a final agreement.Nevertheless, the records of the negotiations on the Treaty were deliveredto the Senate on February 5, 1988, and terms for access to the recordshad been arranged. Senators Byrd and Nunn alerted the Secretary in a letteron February 5, 1988; that due to the Administration's failure to provideany assurances with regard to future interpretation of the INF Treaty,consideration of the Treaty in the Senate could be delayed pending theoutcome of the interpretation dispute. This letter was widely reportedin the press, and the issue was frequently raised during the delegation'sfirst few days in Europe.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Senator Byrd and Senator Nunn took the opportunity of the disputeto educate the European audiences on the role of the Senate in the treaty-makingprocess in the United States. As part of this effort, they assured theEuropean publics that this dispute would be resolved, that it was a proceduraland Constitutional dispute which probably would have little bearing onthe actual outcome (i.e., likely consent to ratification) regarding theINF Treaty, but that it was necessary to resolve the issue, especiallyas it relates to the instant treaty. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When, on February 10, 1988, the Secretary of State responded withanother letter clarifying his position, Senators Byrd and Nunn indicatedat a news conference in Paris that the response was generally satisfactoryand that the possibility of a delay in consideration of the Treaty as aresult of this dispute appeared to have been eliminated. The dispute makesit highly likely, however, that the Senate will address the issue duringconsideration of the Treaty, and Europeans should expect such an outcome.(For texts of the letters and the Senators' statement, see Appendix N.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Despite the favorable progress toward resolving this dispute, thedebate over treaty interpretation raises questions in the minds of manyEuropeans about the stability of the American system and the ability ofthe United States to conclude treaties in good faith. The delegation emphasizedthat this issue was not the result of any actions initiated by the Congressand that, moreover, it was the Congress which had resisted attempts bythe Administration to reinterpret the meaning of the ABM treaty. The delegationalso stressed that actions currently being pursued in the Senate shouldlead to a satisfactory resolution of this issue.</ITAG>[S17MY8-510]{S6019}b. america<ITAG tagnum="89"><CODE-213>5</CODE-213></ITAG><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>b. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>american commitment to europe and the danger of ``decoupling''</T4>[S17MY8-511]{S6019}<ITAG tagnum="21">The prospect of the withdrawal of a class of nuclear weapons fromEurope has again raised anxieties about ``decoupling'' and the credibilityof the American commitment to European security. While the Pershings andCruise Missiles are often portrayed simply as a response to the SS-20 deploymentsby the Soviet Union, it is important to remember that they were also justifiedas part of the continuum of NATO's deterrent capabilities, a necessaryrung on the ladder of escalatory options. Removal of this rung understandablycreates uncertainties. This natural reaction is given increased impetusby the fact that, within the NATO countries themselves, significant politicalconstituencies remain opposed to nuclear weapons and fearful of their continueddeployment in large quantities in Europe. The Soviets, of course, seekto exploit these fears through a skillful propaganda campaign and a diplomaticoffensive aimed at highlighting these fears. Soviet leaders seek to engagethe Alliance in discussions on the remaining short-range nuclear weaponsprior to addressing issues such as the imbalances in conventional and chemicalforces. Added to this volatile mix of nuclear anxieties have been the confusingsignals sent by Washington during the past few years concerning the nuclearguarantee and the United States' commitments to nuclear deterrence.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This concern has become more pronounced since the U.S.-Soviet summitat Reykjavik in 1986. The impression conveyed from that summit was thatthe United States was uncertain about the value of nuclear deterrence inthe European theater, raising old fears of a ``decoupling'' of Americaand Europe, and fueling the arguments of those who believe that Europeshould become a ``nuclear-free zone.'' The denuclearization of Europe appearsto be a high priority for the Soviet Union, which will miss no opportunityto exploit either division in the West or confusion on the question ofnuclear deterrence.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The delegation took the opportunity to reaffirm the commitment tothe NATO strategy of flexible response and to indicate that there is broadsupport in the United States and in the Senate for NATO and for the currentNATO strategy. As Chancellor Kohl and others remarked during the visit,it has been the credibility of the nuclear deterrent which has been ofcentral importance in breaking the cycle of wars on the European continentfor the last 43 years.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Related to the question of American staying power was the perceptionthat the United States may be considering the withdrawal of troops fromEurope. Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci delivered an address atthe Wehrkunde Conference with could have been interpreted as making justsuch a threat, resulting in newspaper headlines with an alarmist tone,such as ``U.S. Warns of Troop Pullout if Bonn Bars Nuclear Arms,'' whichappeared in the <T3>International Herald Tribune</T3> (see Appendix C). While this characterizationof the Secretary of Defense's remarks may be stronger than he intended,the theme of threatened U.S. withdrawal of troops from Europe in the absenceof continued commitments to nuclear modernization continually reappearedthroughout the next several days. It contributed more to European anxietiesabout American presence and commitment that it did to the rallying of opinionbehind common security objectives. Such statements contain the danger ofundoing much of the good that was done by Alliance solidarity throughoutthe INF negotiations. Moreover, since the remarks could be seen to be directedat particular factions within the Federal Republic, German sensitivitieswere somewhat aroused by this public brow-beating of an ally. Such apparentor misconstrued threats should be avoided as they are counterproductive,and the apparent use of them by United States officials can do our Alliesa disservice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Additional concerns in Europe could be found regarding the shiftingpriorities of the United States, particularly in light of the report <T3>Discriminate Deterrence</T3> recently issued by a Blue-Ribbon Departmentof Defense task force. The delegation pointed out that although this reporthas received considerable attention in Europe, it is not authoritativeor representative of a consensus in the U.S. Senate.</ITAG>[S17MY8-512]{S6019}c. meeting<ITAG tagnum="89"><CODE-213>5</CODE-213></ITAG><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>c. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><T4><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>meeting the security challenge in an era of constrainedbudgets</T4>[S17MY8-513]{S6019}<ITAG tagnum="21">Most of the major NATO countries, including the United States, willnot be able to meet the goal of real increases in defense spending of 3%in the coming year. The United States has not met this goal for the pasttwo years. Only Italy will come close to this goal. Turkey is making apositive effort but the Turks face the greatest requirements for modernizationand must rely on security assistance from the United States and West Germanyto meet their minimum security needs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This fact is well understood in NATO, but the regularity with whichthe goal of 3% increases are missed suggests that this is no longer a usefulyardstick for measuring Allied contributions to the common defense. Itis unrealistic to expect Allied governments to increase dramatically theshares of government spending devoted to defense. This does not mean, however,that improvements cannot be made in the ways in which the money is spentor in the efficiency of expenditure. The delegation, and Senator Nunn inparticular, urged the Allies to cooperate more effectively in an effortto ``think smarter, not richer,'' in order to provide the types of conventionalforces which the Alliance will require.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The importance of devoting sufficient resources to defense lies inthe critical relationship between credible conventional defense forcesand the nuclear option which backs up the conventional forces. NATO doesnot have as a goal matching the Warsaw Pact gun for gun or tank for tank.There is no need for that on the part of a defensive alliance. On the otherhand, reliance on nuclear weapons as the exclusive deterrent to aggressionraises deep concerns among publics in Allied countries and could be seenas lacking credibility by potential aggressors. NATO has established anofficial goal of having sufficient stocks to achieve the ability to defendNATO territory conventionally for thirty days, but only the United Statescomes close to meeting this objective among the NATO allies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These issues of burden sharing, reduced funds available for conventionalforces, declining or inadequate levels of assistance to the Southern Regioncountries, and inefficient expenditure of resources among NATO partnerswill confront the Alliance with major challenges in the coming years. Theyconstitute an important backdrop to the need for progress toward conventionalarms control and conventional force reductions in the coming months.</ITAG>[S17MY8-514]{S6020}d.

Federal Republic of Germany</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The delegation spent a fruitful day in Bonn on February 9, 1988, indiscussions with leading figures in the Federal Republic, including ChancellorHelmut Kohl, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Defense MinisterManfred Woerner, and other officials.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There is widespread agreement in the Federal Republic that the INFTreaty should be ratified without amendment. Despite initial doubts aboutthe ``second zero'' of short-range INF missiles and reluctance to scrapthe German Pershing I's, the Treaty has widespread support in the Germangovernment, in the opposition, and among the general public.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The issues foremost on the agenda in the Federal Republic concernthe nature and scope of future arms control negotiations, the timetablefor decisions concerning modernization, and bilateral relations betweenthe Federal Republic and other NATO allies, particularly France. Theseissues are, of course, overlaid by the dynamics of German domestic politics,where the opposition Social Democratic Party is showing increased strengthat the <T3>Land</T3> level and where tensions on these issues within the rulingcoalition can be discerned.</ITAG>[S17MY8-517]{S6020}further di<ITAG tagnum="89">further discussions on short-range nuclear forces</ITAG>[S17MY8-518]{S6020}<ITAG tagnum="21">The themes which were examined during the meetings in Bonn were previewedin the speeches by Chancellor Kohl and opposition Social Democratic Party(SPD) leader Hans-Jochen Vogel at the Wehrkunde Conference. Vogel, althoughcarefully couching his words in terms of overall support for the Alliance,nevertheless raised a number of issues which clearly run counter to theconsensus among NATO governments today and could presage future controversiesin NATO. He indicated, for example, the SPD's support for <T3>S<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>multaneous</T3> pursuit of negotiations to reducethe conventional force imbalance and further efforts to negotiate limitson short-range nuclear forces. This view is also shared by many in theruling coalition.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In contrast to the apparent position of Dr. Vogel, officials in theFederal Republic expressed their opposition to the ``Third Zero'' of short-rangeland-based ballistic missile reductions. But a significant cleavage, notonly within German opinion but also between Germany and the rest of theNATO Alliance, may be developing concerning the timing of discussions concerningthe short-range systems. Both Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister Genscherappear to favor beginning discussions on reducing the short-range nuclearsystems deployed in Europe (most of which, of course, are deployed by NATOin West Germany and by the Warsaw Pact in East Germany) at the same timediscussions on limiting conventional forces are undertaken, a positionwhich appears to be in line with that outlined by Dr. Vogel at Wehrkunde.West German officials argue that the communique of the NATO ministerialmeeting at Reykjavik endorses this concept. This view is not shared bythe other NATO Allies. Even within Germany, the fear was expressed thatundertaking such discussions could result in NATO facing a Soviet proposalfor a third zero which would be hard to resist. It is likely that disagreementsover the timing of discussions on further efforts to reduce short-rangenuclear arms in Europe will characterize Alliance discussions in comingmonths. This issue could become one of significant dispute within the NATOalliance unless handled skillfully and carefully.</ITAG>[S17MY8-519]{S6020}Overall Se<ITAG tagnum="89">Overall Security Concept</ITAG>[S17MY8-520]{S6020}<ITAG tagnum="21">The German officials with whom the Congressional delegation met placeda great deal of emphasis on the need for an overall concept of securityto guide the Alliance in its force modernization decisions and in its armscontrol approach to the Warsaw Pact. While it would be possible to seethis as an effort to delay tough decisions or to revisit decisions whichthe Alliance has already made, it can also be seen as a legitimate concernand one which the Alliance should take seriously. The Federal Republiccan be expected to press this view in coming months.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As the Alliance struggles to define a common position for new talkson conventional stability in Europe, talks which may start later this year,it will be important for the Alliance to be guided by a common set of objectivesand a shared vision as to the desired outcomes of the negotiations. Itgoes without saying that asymmetrical reductions in Warsaw Pact troopswill be required, but in the absence of a common set of goals and a visionof the final outcome of the talks, the Alliance runs the risk that Sovietproposals which appear good on the surface could be used to great publicrelations effects in the West without an effective counter by NATO governments.This must be avoided, and, to that extent, the German emphasis on a strategicconcept should be welcomed. Focus on the concept could have the additionalbenefit of providing the means by which the French can be truly broughton board an Alliance-wide position in the talks.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Officials in Germany, and Chancellor Kohl in particular, emphasizedthat NATO is about to enter into a contest of ``religion'' and psychologywith the Soviet Union over the question of conventional force reductions,and that it is very important for NATO to seize the psychological initiativeon these issues in the coming year. NATO should take advantage of the momentumgenerated by the INF agreement to formulate a proposal on conventionalarms control which unites the West and challenges the Soviets. </ITAG>[S17MY8-521]{S6020}nuclear mo<ITAG tagnum="89">nuclear modernization </ITAG>[S17MY8-522]{S6020}<ITAG tagnum="21">The question of modernization of short-range nuclear weapons was onewhich arose at every session with German officials. Chancellor Kohl carefullyskirted the issue of modernization in his address at the Wehrkunde gathering,artfully avoiding the use of the term. While the Congressional delegationstrongly supports the Montebello approach to these issues and believesthat all NATO Allies should fulfill their responsibilities within the NATOcontext, the delegation shared the view in Germany that modernization ofshort-range forces and the INF Treaty are <T3>separate </T3>issues which are not and <T3>should not be directly linked. </T3>The delegation shares the viewof Defense Minister Woerner and others that the issues of nuclear modernizationand the nature of the specific systems to be modernized are decisions whichshould be handled in due course as part of the Alliance's routine nuclearplanning process. There is no need for a bruising public debate on theseissues at the present time. </ITAG>[S17MY8-523]{S6020}bilateral <ITAG tagnum="89">bilateral initiatives </ITAG>[S17MY8-524]{S6020}<ITAG tagnum="21">Concerning the initiatives with France and the formation of the Franco-GermanDefense Council and the jointly-manned brigade, the German government arguesforcefully that bilateral initiatives with France are designed to bringFrance more fully into cooperation with NATO, and are not part of the creationof a rival force to NATO. German officials also express strong supportfor the efforts of the Action Committee for Europe and the strengtheningof the European Pillar_and contend that France must be brought into theseefforts. It is unlikely that the scope and extent of the bilateral cooperationwill extend beyond the recently established single brigade in the nearfuture, but it could be expanded in principle. The Germans, of course,wish to use the brigade as a device to draw the French more firmly intothe forward defense concept of NATO as well. The delegation expressed,in general, its support for improved bilateral initiatives, emphasizingthe importance of avoiding the creation of organizations competitive withNATO. German officials carefully noted that the forces committed to thejoint brigade in no way would reduce the numbers of German forces committedto NATO. </ITAG>[S17MY8-525]{S6020}soviet pol<ITAG tagnum="89">soviet policy</ITAG>[S17MY8-526]{S6020}<ITAG tagnum="21">The diplomatic efforts of the Soviet Union and the dynamic publicrelations offensive which Mr. Gorbachev is capable of mounting will doubtlessbe directed at the Federal Republic with special force in the coming months.Chancellor Kohl, in recalling the extensive efforts to block developmentsof the INF, which the Soviets encouraged in direct and indirect ways, notedthat he has seen no deviation in the Soviet objective of isolating Germanyand splitting it from the rest of NATO under the Gorbachev regime. Whilewe are unlikely to see in the near future the spectacle of 300,000 demonstratorsgathered on the lawn outside the Chancellor's office, as was the case priorto INF deployments, it is worth recalling that great political obstacleswere overcome in successfully implementing the INF decision, and that futuredecisions may require commensurate efforts. </ITAG>[S17MY8-527]{S6020}C. Britain<ITAG tagnum="74">C. Britain </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The delegation met with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,Defense Minister George Younger, Minister of State for Foreign and CommonwealthAffairs David Mellor, and with the former leader of the Social DemocraticParty (and former Shadow Labour Defense Spokesman) David Owen. In addition,a luncheon with Neil Kinnock and other leaders of the opposition, LabourParty was hosted by the Ambassador. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The discussions in Britain centered on the security issues facingthe Alliance in the post-INF environment, with attention to the themeswhich characterized discussions in all countries: maintaining the unityand cohesion of NATO; responding to the challenges of Soviet initiativesin all spheres, but especially in conventional arms control; pursuit ofcooperative ventures with France without, at the same time, underminingthe unity and cohesiveness of NATO; and modernization of remaining nuclearsystems in NATO. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Strong support exists among officials in the British government forthe ratification of the INF treaty without substantial amendments or reservationswhich would alter its fundamental character. Officials expressed satisficationwith the manner in which consultations on INF had been conducted by theUnited States before the summit. The British, not unlike other NATO allies,had been concerned following the Reykjavik summit about comments made byPresident Reagan questioning the utility of nuclear deterrence and favoringa nuclear-free world, but, on the whole, these concerns appear to havebeen mollified. At bottom, the view was expressed that it would be a disasterif the INF Treaty were not ratified, if the word of the U.S. Presidentin these matters could not be taken seriously.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mrs. Thatcher, in particular, went to considerable lengths to expressher own view that the nuclear genie could not be put back into the bottle,and that efforts to try to do so would be in vain. She stated that herpreference is for a world free from war, not a world free from nuclearweapons. Indeed, it is nuclear weapons and NATO's doctrine of deterrencethrough flexible response that has preserved the peace in Europe. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Getting the French to act in support of the NATO Alliance, even ifthey refuse to rejoin the integrated military command, is an objectiveof British policy. The skepticism regarding the French-German brigade,which had been voiced earlier by Mrs. Thatcher, seemed to have been toneddown during the visit of the delegation. Instead, Mrs. Thatcher and othersemphasized that they welcomed French activities which could be seen assupportive of NATO's objectives. The British are opposed to the creationof multilateral organizations which could be seen to compete with NATO.For these reasons they did not support the inclusion of forces from othercountries in the French-German brigade, and they also believed that theinstitutions of the Western European Union should be co-located in Brussels.Finally, the British expressed support for cooperative development of astand-off missile by the United States, United Kingdom, and France ratherthan solely a bilateral British-French project. Again, the objective isto bring the French more closely into cooperation with NATO. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Gorbachev is viewed by the British government with skepticismand caution. While he can be seen as a reformer in the Soviet domesticsense, his foreign policy remains based on the military power of the SovietUnion and on efforts to drive a wedge between members of NATO, particularlybetween the United States and Europe and between the West Germans and therest of NATO. Soviet arms control proposals will be couched in terms designedto have the maximum psychological impact on Western publics. It will beimportant to prepare appropriate responses, and to develop our own proposalswhich seize the initiative. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The British government is emphatic in stating its belief that discussionson limiting NATO's short-range nuclear forces should not begin until progresshas been made on more pressing issues of chemical weapons and the conventionalforces imbalance. The British also argue that modernization of short-rangeforces should proceed with no delays. It is possible to proceed in twoseparate boxes, one focusing on the agreements made at Montebello, andthe other focusing on the current work of NATO's Nuclear Planning Group,which is considering specific proposals which might be seen as implementingthe Montebello and Reykjavik agreements by NATO. The British are unabashedin their willingness to press the Germans on the point of nuclear modernization,rejecting the German argument that negotiations on short-range nuclearforces can occur simultaneously with negotiations on conventional forces.The British government is also skeptical about the position of FRG officialsthat, once begun, the discussions on shorter-range systems can be limitedto proposals for equal ceilings on each side rather than the Third Zero.In the British view, the entire Soviet approach is aimed at reducing thenuclear deterrent in Europe, and discussions on short-range systems aresubject to manipulation for public impact. Therefore, they should be avoided.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While supportive of a START agreement at the earliest time feasible,the British are adamantly opposed to the inclusion of any third countrysystems under START ceilings until well after superpower arsenals havebeen reduced by fifty percent. They are also concerned that START countingrules for Trident missiles not have an adverse impact on the British Tridentsystem.</ITAG>[S17MY8-528]{S6021}D. France<ITAG tagnum="74">D.

In addition, the delegation met for two hours in a roundtable discussion with French intellectuals and journalists on the rangeof issues confronting the Alliance. The transcript of that round tablediscussion is included in Appendix J. It provides important insights intothe range of French views on the security issue.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The visit to Paris came at a time of important reassessment by theFrench of the state of the Atlantic relationship, and the delegation wasgiven an articulate exposition of the various risks which the Alliancecurrently faces. The visit also occurred at a time when the French haveundertaken historic initiatives with the Germans in cooperative arrangementsin the military field. On January 22, 1988, President Mitterrand and ChancellorKohl strengthened their ties by forming a high-level military commissionto coordinate Franco-German policies on defense and arms control matters.Second, the French responded enthusiastically to Chancellor Kohl's offerto form a Franco-German military brigade, composed of 3,000-4,000 troops.At the time of the delegation's visit, the planning for the brigade wasproceeding smoothly. Despite initial reservations by other European NATOpartners (primarily Italy and Great Britain), a growing consensus on theacceptability of the arrangement can now be discerned. The delegation repeatedits view, expressed in Germany as well, that this is a generally positivedevelopment. </ITAG>[S17MY8-529]{S6021}arms contr<ITAG tagnum="89">arms control discussions supported</ITAG>[S17MY8-530]{S6021}<ITAG tagnum="21">President Mitterrand was emphatic in his support for the INF Treaty,and noted that he wasn't merely paying ``lip service.'' He outlined hisopposition in principle to the development of intermediate-range nuclearweapons, based on his belief that they weaken deterrence because they couldlead an adversary to question one's resolve to use strategic weapons inresponse to aggression. He gave a spirited exposition on the need for ahigh level of deterrence_that is, unquestioned certainty in the mind ofthe adversary that any attack would meet with immediate and overwhelmingresponse_and of the need for the adversary to fear such a response. Thus,his approval of the INF agreement, which he indicated he believed to bestronger than that of most European leaders, was based in part on his lackof enthusiasm for the doctrine of flexible response. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A corollary to the President's view in this regard in his relativelack of enthusiasm for modernization of short-range nuclear missiles andartillery. Mitterrand is thus more supportive of what appears to be theGerman government's position on this issue than are most other Europeanofficials. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mitterrand favored a START agreement, but did not feel it made muchof a difference, given the overwhelming size of the superpower's arsenals.On the other hand, he emphasized his conviction that the ``most urgentpriority'' in arms control was to move forward on negotiations on <T3>conventional arms reductions, </T3>both to reassure Western publicsand to indicate to the Soviets that we are watching them and will not letthem go any further to tilt the balance in this area. Mitterrand said that,while ``reductions of 50 percent (START) is a good thing, it doesn't diminishthe risk, especially for Europe. It would be more important, more significantto see an agreement reached in the fields of conventional and chemicalweapons.'' He emphasized that the Senate should be aware that the conventionalarms reductions negotiations are the most important negotiations that canreassure America's European partners. And, like other French officials,he contended that short-range nuclear weapons should be separated fromthe conventional talks. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Foreign Minister Raimond observed that the major risk that must beunderstood is that of ``precipitous'' negotiations with the Soviets whichfurther advance the Soviet goal of denuclearizing Europe. A specific manifestationof this problem could include being swept into negotiations which put irresistablepressure on the West to eliminate all ground-launched short-range nuclearmissiles, i.e., the ``third zero.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In Raimond's view, the very fact of having negotiated the zero agreementin the INF Treaty fits into the Soviet goal of denuclearizing Europe, agoal which is clearly a central objective of Soviet policies toward Europe.Thus, it is clear that Gorbachev's next focus will be to push for a thirdzero on the remaining nuclear missiles as the further expression of thispolicy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Pressure for negotiations toward a third zero fits into the fundamentalobjective of dividing NATO, because the Soviets recognize the potentialof the third zero to cause strains between Germany and the United States.(Indeed, the French noted that the ``second zero'' on shorter-range missilesembodied in the INF Treaty has already begun to produce tensions betweenGermany and the rest of NATO over modernization issues.) This does notmean, of course, that the INF Treaty is not valuable. Achievements suchas asymmetrical reductions and verification breakthroughs are duly noted.The real question concerns the priorities of the United States subsequentto the INF accord. Minister Raimond listed conventional and chemical armsreduction talks, along with START, as the proper focus of the U.S. andthe West for the present time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Raimond identified a second risk which the West faces in the post-INFenvironment, and that is to confuse nuclear and conventional negotiations.The Soviets need a large conventional force to maintain their hold overEastern Europe, and will try to mix conventional talks with those involvingWestern short range nuclear systems. The West must not permit such mixing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A third risk is to negotiate with the Soviets against the pressureof deadlines. For instance, a good agreement on START, including subceilings,verification and other matters would be acceptable if reached this year,but it appears unlikely that such an agreement could be achieved. In noevent should time deadlines force the West to agree to something whichis not consistent with security requirements.</ITAG>[S17MY8-531]{S6022}french-ger<ITAG tagnum="89">french-german relations</ITAG>[S17MY8-532]{S6022}<ITAG tagnum="21">On the subject of French-German relations, President Mitterrand madeseveral important observations. First, he stated that he has revised theDe Gaulle Doctrine whereby French forces should not be east of the Hamburg-Munichline to avoid getting mixed up with NATO forces. Now, instead, French forceswill be anywhere that there is a threat of war or a war. President Mitterrandstated, ``I . . . don't like French forces integrated into the allied commandbut, if we see soldiers of a neighboring country threatened, France couldnot face dishonor and pull its forces out_the only possible course of actionis to intervene.'' Thus, while France will not reevaluate its decisionto avoid military reintegration into NATO, primarily because it does notwant to be a prisoner of the decisions of the collective Alliance, thesestatements on French willingness to consider French security as linkedinextricably to that of its neighbors represent a significant step in France'sstrategic thinking.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mitterrand recalled that, as a young deputy only three years afterthe end of World War II, he had participated in symposia oriented at theintegration of Europe and the importance of bringing Germany back intothe European community. He felt that that challenge had been won. Frenchmentoday, in opinion polls, rank Germany most popular, only behind a few French-speakingcountries. He praised the Franco-German brigade and its importance in historicterms, and reassured the delegation that there was no intent on the partof France to use it to weaken Germany's place in NATO.</ITAG>[S17MY8-533]{S6022}Assessment<ITAG tagnum="89">Assessments of Soviet Policy</ITAG>[S17MY8-534]{S6022}<ITAG tagnum="21">President Mitterrand praised Gorbachev's broad-mindedness and frankness,which had been demonstrated during his extensive personal dialogues withthe Soviet leader. Mitterrand observed that it is irrelevant whether Gorbachevis ``sincere.'' That is not the question. The question is whether a politicianis behaving as if he were sincere. We have to create the conditions suchthat what is stated by a leader actually happens, to make it to his advantageto do as he says. Mitterrand evaluated Gorbachev as the manager of a revolution,not a revolutionary; a Leninist, not a Stalinist; and of the Andropov type,not a Brezhnev or Chernenko type. He is a realist. The challenge to theWest is not to do those things which are in Gorbachev's interest only,but to work on areas where his interests and the West's converge.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While confident that adroit diplomacy and careful management of thepublic debate could easily counter the challenges presented by Gorbachev,French officials nevertheless counseled caution in dealing with the Sovietsand expressed respect for Gorbachev's public relations skills. The keyis not to pursue either extreme in interpreting Gorbachev: (1) assumingthat he is simply a Machiavellian manipulator, and that nothing has changed,or (2) assuming that he is a genuine reformer and that everything has changed.The West must encourage the changes being undertaken in the Soviet Union,but keep a clear eye focused on Western security interests in negotiatingwith the Soviet leadership.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Finally, the underlying French concern is the effect that Gorbachev'sseductive style is having on the West. Western leaders must be preparedto ``go against public opinion, and convince the people'' of where theirreal interests lie.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Foreign Minister Raimond observed that Gorbachev is an astute anddangerous manipulator of Western public opinion. He reiterated the Frenchview that the period immediately ahead would be difficult and would presenta number of risks and challenges to the West, in part due to the non-confrontationalstyle employed by Gorbachev in pursuit of traditional Soviet foreign policyobjectives.</ITAG>[S17MY8-535]{S6022}french con<ITAG tagnum="89">french consensus</ITAG>[S17MY8-536]{S6022}<ITAG tagnum="21">French Defense Minister Giraud reiterated many of the same themesexpressed by other officials. Indeed, there is broad agreement in Franceon many questions related to security and to nuclear weapons. Of specificinterest were Minister Giraud's comments that, with the march of technology,there was enhanced need for greater cooperation on a wider range of technicalmilitary matters among members of the Alliance. He specifically cited bothFrench-British and French-American cooperation, in addition to the initiativesthat the French were engaged in with the Germans. In Giraud's view, allof this must be pursued under the condition that such European cooperationnot weaken, or appear to weaken, NATO. The effect of the INF Treaty onEuropean security must be coldly analyzed, from a military perspective,and Minister Giraud reiterated the priorities outlined by Foreign MinisterRaimond, i.e., support the efforts on START while avoiding the trap ofdiscussions leading to a third nuclear zero prior to settling the seriousimbalances which exist with the Warsaw Pact on conventional and chemicalweapons.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The delegation was impressed with the creativity and seriousness ofFrench thinking on security issues, and feels that the observations madein discussions in France added greatly to the delegation's overall understanding.Efforts to strengthen the European Pillar of western security, in whichthe French role will be critical, should be encouraged. The Recommendationsand Declaration of the Action Committee for Europe (See Appendix O), thesignificance of which was emphasized by President of the National AssemblyJacques Chaban-Delmas and by Francois Fillon, merit careful attention inregard to these issues.</ITAG>[S17MY8-537]{S6022}E. Turkey <ITAG tagnum="74">E. Turkey </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As a NATO ally which could be subjected to missile attacks from SS-20sbased in the Asian part of the Soviet Union, Turkey has a special interestin the global elimination of long-range INF missiles and, like other NATOAllies, is supportive of the INF agreement as negotiated. Turkey has nothad intermediate-range surface-to-surface missiles capable of reachingthe Soviet Union based in Turkey since the Jupiters were withdrawn in theearly 1960s. Removal of the INF missiles places all of NATO once againin this category. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Turkey shares an extensive border with the Soviet Union and Sovietships must pass through the Bosphorus as they enter and exit the BlackSea. The geographical location of Turkey affords it a key role in the defenseof NATO's Southern Region, and its contribution to the conventional defenseof NATO is especially important. Therefore, while Turkey generally welcomesthe INF agreement, the treaty will have relatively little impact on theTurkish strategic situation. From that standpoint, the need to modernizethe Turkish conventional forces and to present the Soviet Union with acredible conventional deterrent remain high priorities, virtually unaffectedby the INF agreement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The high priority accorded conventional force modernization is understandablein view of the overwhelming Soviet advantage in the force balance oppositeTurkey and in view of the extreme needs faced by the Turkish forces. Inthis context, the fact that security assistance to Turkey has, in the pasttwo years, amounted to approximately half of what would be required toimplement fully the conventional force modernization program identifiedby NATO as meeting Turkey's requirements has been a disappointment to theTurks. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Codel met with a broad range of Turkish officials during its briefvisit to Ankara. Despite the short duration of the visit, a full exchangeof views was held on a variety of security issues, including but not limitedto the INF Treaty and its impact on NATO. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As noted above, Turkish officials were unanimous in their supportfor the treaty, hailing it as a big step forward for the Alliance. At thesame time, as was noted in other countries visited by the Codel, the treatyalso removes one component of the Alliance's flexible response strategy.This means that it will be necessary to pay continued attention to theissues of modernization of the remaining conventional and nuclear forces.In Turkey, there is strong support for modernization initiatives in NATO,and the Turkish government can be expected to participate to the limitsof its ability in these common efforts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Codel emphasized in its discussions with Turkish officials, includingChief of the Turkish General Staff General Necip Torumtay, an appreciationof the unique geographic situation of Turkey and of the efforts of theTurkish military to maintain its capability in the face of severe resourceconstraints. The military and intelligence-gathering functions which Turkeyperforms are important contributions to overall Alliance security. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Two issues which have been the sources of some problems were discussedin this regard: the continued deadlock on Cyprus and the continued presenceof Turkish troops on the island, and the fact that the Side Letters tothe Defense and Economic Cooperation Agreement (DECA) which had been signedin March of 1987 had not yet been fully implemented by Turkey. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With regard to Cyprus, Turkish officials were hopeful that progresscould be made in the further reduction of Turkish presence on the islandand in achieving a diplomatic solution to the conflict. Citing the recentmeeting in Davos, Switzerland, between Prime Minister Ozal and Greek PrimeMinister Papandreou, the Codel expressed its hope that the ``spirit ofDavos'' could be extended in dealing with the situation on Cyprus. Whilereiterating the Turkish government's position that the proposals of theUnited Nations Secretary General should be accepted by the Greek Cypriotside, Turkish officials also expressed a willingness to pursue new avenuestowards an accord, especially in light of the recent elections on Cyprusand the fact that the Greek Cypriots have elected a new leader. The Codelstrongly encouraged further steps in the direction of a negotiated solutionto the Cyprus problem. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Codel also urged Turkey to end the delay in ratifying the DECAside letters, noting that nearly one year had passed since their signing.The Codel argued that ratification of the side letters would be in Turkey'sinterest and would send a positive signal to the United States about thecontinued close cooperation between the two countries. Prime Minister Ozalstated that he would, in fact, ratify the two side letters in the nearfuture, as a symbol of his desire to continue to build upon and improvethe extensive military and security cooperation between the United Statesand Turkey. [Note: Subsequently, on February 26, 1988, the Turkish governmentratified the side letters.] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Immediately following the departure of the Codel, the incident inthe Black Sea involving two U.S. warships and a Soviet vessel occurred.This incident points up the strategic importance of the Turkish Straitsand the continued potential for conflict in this area. It reinforces thepoints made by the Turkish General Staff in briefing the Codel immediatelyprior to its departure.</ITAG>[S17MY8-538]{S6023}F. Italy <ITAG tagnum="74">F. Italy </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Delegation arrived in Italy in the midst of a governmental ``crisis''over the budget. Prime Minister Goria had resigned, and it was not clearthat he would be asked to form a new government. Of course, these ``crises''occur in Italian politics with some frequency, and they do not often resultin major changes of direction in the basic course of Italian policy. (Duringthe Delegation's stay in Rome, Goria was asked to form a new governmentby Italian President Cossiga, but that government was also short-lived.)In addition to its own governmental dilemmas, Italy also attended the EuropeanCommunity Economic Summit on February 12, 1988, which, after thirty hoursof extremely difficult bargaining, produced an important agreement on thefuture economic structure of the Community. Despite these distractions,Italian officials were generous with their time and with their insightson the issues of concern to the Delegation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Delegation was able to draw some preliminary observations basedon its visits to four NATO capitals prior to Rome and to share those observationswith Italian journalists and academic experts at a meeting on February12, 1988. The transcript of that session is printed in Appendix L.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Delegation emphasized to Italian officials with whom it met thatItaly's contributions to the NATO Alliance were not only recognized butdeeply appreciated. Italy was the first country on the continent of Europeto accept the deployments of the INF missiles, thus relieving the FederalRepublic of Germany of its fears of ``singularity'' in deployments andpaving the way for the Netherlands and Belgium to accept deployments aswell. At the same time, Italy has been strongly supportive of the effortsto negotiate the zero option, and is unreserved in its support of ratificationof the Treaty.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At the same time, Italian officials recognized that NATO is at a momentwhen new challenges must be confronted and when NATO's cohesion will betested. Foreign Minister Andreotti, who has served in the Italian governmentvirtually throughout the entire history of NATO, argued strongly that NATOmust formulate new approaches for the new contingencies which lie ahead,emphasizing at all times the unity and cohesion of NATO.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The theme of the need to focus on NATO unity and the security of theWest as a whole was a constant theme in the remarks of Italian officials.For example, while not unduly concerned about the French-German brigadeand efforts at improved bilateral relations, the Italians warned that suchapproaches could divert NATO members from the central task, which is commonsecurity. The Western European Union or NATO should be the focus of mostefforts. Creating zones of ``differentiated security'' in NATO must definitelybe avoided.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Delegation members shared this view, and assured Italian officialsthat the United States was committed to a strong NATO and a unified Alliance.Senators Byrd and Boren, in particular, praised Italy for its willingnessto step up to important Alliance decisions, citing not only the INF deploymentsbut also areas not strictly related to NATO, such as the deployments toLebanon, the Persian Gulf, and intelligence cooperation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Widespread consensus was noted among Italian officials regarding thepriorities for arms control negotiations and the next steps which NATOshould take in this regard. The START talks were accorded a high priority,to be followed by talks on chemical and conventional weapons. There waslittle support for beginning talks on short-range nuclear forces beforethe other talks had achieved results.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Italian officials were optimistic about the implications of the INFTreaty for future arms control negotiations, an attitude which in someways paralleled the German views. They were pleased at the opinion expressedby members of the Delegation that the INF Treaty was likely to receivea favorable vote in the Senate. They regard the principles of asymmetricalreductions and <T3>reductions</T3> rather than <T3>ceilings</T3> as important milestones in the history of arms control,achievements which, in the words of Foreign Minister Andreotti, constitutea great landmark. The hope was widely shared that these principles couldbe applied in conventional forces talks as well.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Italian officials also took a pragmatic approach to the questionof nuclear modernization. Rather than press for any public or immediatedecision at the present time, they counseled that modernization decisionsshould be taken when required and pursued in a businesslike fashion. Thereis no need, according to this line of thinking, for there to be a publiccrisis in the Alliance over these issues.</ITAG>[S17MY8-539]{S6023}Conclusion<ITAG tagnum="74">Conclusions and Recommendations</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The delegation encountered a widespread consensus in the capitalsvisited on the essential course of Alliance policy.

Because of the importance of these new negotiations,at the initiative of the Majority and Minority leaders, the Senate createda new Senate body, the Senate Arms Control Observer Group, to monitor them.This was the major item of Senate business on the first day of the 99thCongress, January 3, 1985, (S.

A delegationconsisting of eight of the ten Senators in the Arms Control Observer Group,and headed by the two leaders, attended the opening sessions of these negotiationsfrom March 9-12 in Geneva.\4\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68"><NOTE/>\4\ Senators Moynihan and Wallop were unable to attend dueto other pressing Senate business.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The United States Senate has the constitutional responsibility ofproviding advice and consent in the making of treaties. This responsibilityimposes upon Senators the obligation to become as knowledgeable as possibleconcerning the salient issues which are being addressed in the contextof the negotiating process. Any accord with the Soviet Union to controlor reduce our strategic weapons carries considerable weight for our nation.It will vitally affect our national security, the security of all our constituents,and the security of our allies. Such an agreement, or agreements, mustbe supported by a substantial national consensus to stand the test of time.Such a consensus is best achieved through the traditional treaty-makingprocess which has been followed in the field of strategic arms controlagreements entered into by the United States.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations has jurisdictional and oversightresponsibility with regard to arms control negotiations and agreements.It is the purpose of the Senate Arms Control Observer Group to supplementthe activities of the Foreign Relations Committee by providing a more regularand systematic involvement of the full Senate in the negotiations, withoutin any sense assuming the role of participants or negotiators in thesetalks. While the Foreign Relations Committee overs<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ees<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> arms control negotiations on a continuing basis,the full Senate has focused its attention in the past only sporadicallyon the vital aspects of arms control negotiations, usually developing aknowledge and understanding of the issues being negotiated after the fact_thatis, after a draft treaty has been signed by the Executive branch. The resultof this fitful process has been generally unsatisfactory in recent years.We seek to avoid a recurrence of the problems of the 1970's, when threesuccessive arms control treaties, signed by three Presidents, were neverapproved for ratification by the Senate. These include the SALT II Treatyof 1979, the Threshhold Test Ban Treaty of 1974, and the Peaceful NuclearExplosions Treaty of 1976.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In fulfillment of our constitutional responsibility in providing adviceand consent in the making of treaties, we believe it is necessary to becomecompletely conversant concerning the particular issues under negotiation.We believe that such knowledge is critical to the understanding by theSenate of the issues involved, and that an intimate knowledge of the evolvingissues will permit our negotiators to have the benefit of our advice andcounsel, when appropriate, on a continuing basis during the course of thenegotiations. We believe that the Senate will be in a far better positionto evaluate any agreement which may be reached and that such agreementmight benefit from the reactions of the Senate as it is being formulated.We also firmly believe that the interplay of ideas that has occurred andwill continue to occur with the members of our observer team will be ofassistance to our negotiators.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the event that the negotiations fail, the Senate will be in a betterposition to understand and to make comprehensible to the American peoplejust why that failure occurred.

In December 1984, SenateMajority Leader-elect Dole decided to introduce a resolution in the 99thCongress aimed at underscoring the strong support in the Senate for thePresident's arms control efforts. To emphasize the importance of this issue,Senator Dole planned to make this resolution the first substantive actof his leadership and to seek affirmative action on it the first day ofthe new Congress, January 3, 1985. Further, to demonstrate the bipartisannature of the support which he believed existed in the Senate, SenatorDole early on sought the participation and cooperation in the effort ofSenate Minority Leader Robert C. Byrd.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Simultaneously, Senator Byrd was already pursuing the possibilityof creating a Senate arms control observer group. His initial proposalin this regard was made by telephone to President Reagan on December 9,1984. Senator Byrd suggested that a small, bipartisan group of Senators,recommended by the Senate leadership, be appointed as official observerson our delegation to any arms control negotiations which might result fromthe meetings to be held in Geneva between Secretary of State George Shultzand Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in Geneva on January 7-8, 1985.The reaction by the President was enthusiastic and positive, and SenatorByrd followed up this initial discussion with a letter to the Presidentoutlining his proposal on December 13, 1984.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In follow-up discussions, Senators Dole and Byrd agreed to meld theirapproaches in a single resolution, including the concept of an observergroup. Senator Dole broached this idea with the Administration and, onJanuary 2, 1985, Acting Secretary of State Kenneth Dam wrote to SenatorDole providing a positive Administration reaction to the proposal. He indicatedthat an Observer Group would be welcomed by the Administration and thatthe Group would be provided full briefings by our negotiators to any armscontrol talks which might emerge. Further, he indicated that the Administrationwould seek to have the Senators meet on an informal basis with the Sovietdelegates as well.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On the basis of this dialogue, the Senate passed S.

Madam President, as we all know by now, the official line_moredelicately put, the official U.S. claim_is that this INF Treaty removesfrom Europe an entire class of nuclear weapons; that is to say, those witha range between 500 and 5,500 kilometers. There used to be a song a long time ago intitled ``But It Ain't NecessarilySo,'' that song fits, because the preponderance <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>of<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the evidence, for those who will take the time toanalyze and assess this treaty, demonstates clearly that this claim bythe State Department and others is far from accurate.A more nearly accurate assessment is that nuclear weapons will not_andI repeat, for the purpose of emphasis, will not_be reduced under the termsof this treaty. Indeed, this treaty permits the Soviets to remove agingdelivery vehicles from their stockpile, to take the delivery vehicles outand bolt new and updated delivery systems onto existing warheads. Thatis not arms reduction. The nuclear devices, of course, are the most expensive and difficult componentsto produce; and I emphasize that by the time this treaty is fully implemented,all of the U.S.-NATO strategic weapons in Europe will have been removed,<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> and<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the Soviet Union nuclear forces targeted on Europewill have been fully modernize. Regardless of all the snake-oil claimsmade, that is a fact. The Soviet Union will be at least as powerful and,in fact, more formidable than ever. The Soviet Union can defeat the purpose of the INF Treaty in two ways:One, the Soviets can defeat the treaty by following its terms to the letter.The Soviets knew what they were doing when they negotiated this treaty.Will Rogers said a long time ago that the United States has never losta war nor won a treaty. S<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ec<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ond, the Soviets can defeat this treaty by cheating,and they have developed that to a fine art, as all of us should know. Butin this case, the Soviets probably will do both, at <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>virt<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ually no risk of being caught at it. Let me elaborate.The Soviets can defeat the treaty's purpose simply by following its termscarefully. That is why the Soviets have been so eager to have this treatyratified. The missiles to be eliminated are defined so restrict<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ively<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> that the old missile, the SS-20, is prohibited.But a new, enhanced version of vertually the same Soviet missile, knownas the SS-25, is not prohibited. The point is that the SS-25 can do everythingthat the prohibited SS-20 can do, and then some. Because the treaty exemptsmissiles tested, even ones at a longer range than 5,500 kil<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>omet<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ers, the SS-25 is left untouched by this treaty.That is an acknowledged fact. It was brought up repeatedly during the considerationof the treaty by the Foreign Relations Committee and by the Armed ServicesCommittee, and the proponents of the committee said, ``So what?''My response was, ``So, a lot,'' because as al<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eady pointed out, the Soviets can even use the samenuclear weapons, and I am <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>now<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> talking about the warheads, removed from the SS-20'sthat are to be destroyed under the terms of this treaty. The Soviets can also defeat the treaty's p<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ur<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>poses by cheating. And who in this Senate will denythe long record of the Soviet Union at duplicity and cheating? The Soviets have cheated massively on every previous arms control agreement,and no less than Ronald Reagan himself has said this repeatedly. I havea hunch that if Ronald Rea<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>gan<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> were running for President this year, instead offinishing up his 8 years in the White House, he would be out on the hustingsdemanding that this treaty be rejected by the Senate.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>In fact, the SS-25_and that is the missile that isnot covered by this treaty_the SS-25 itself is a violation of the constraintsof SALT II. It was established clearly in the committee hearings that wedo not know how many SS-20's the Soviets have produced. We never will.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The astonishingly wide var<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>iat<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ion of estimates by our nine intelligence agencieson this question about the number of SS-20's produced by the Soviet Unionmakes it certain that we will never know when, or if, all of the SS-20delivery vehicles have been destroyed. And bear in mind that no matterhow many tubes are destroyed, if you want to describe them that way, thewarheads will be removed, and they can be bolted on the SS-25's. Now thewarhead is the weapon.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The variation in our intelligence estimates, reportedlyranging from as low as 550 to at least 1,250, is far too wide to be acceptedby a reasonable mind.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Under the treaty, the Soviets promise to destroy650 SS-20 delivery vehicles. Yet if they do so, they could still have another300 to 600 hidden as a covert force, according to evaluations reportedlyemanating from the majority of our nine intelligence agencies.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I do not think many Americans understand that yet.Maybe not many Senators do.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>But the notion that a covert missile force of thatsize would not be militarily significant represents, I think, the triumphantof hope over common sense.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Although some administration witnesses attemptedto maintain that such a covert force would be militarily useless withoutthe chance to test fire the missiles regularly to test reliability_testssupposedly, but only supposedly, detectable_<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>no<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> one has refuted President Reagan's own report thatthe Soviets had kept a similar covert force of more than 100 SS-16's for8 years without the United States detecting either a test or the missilesthemselves.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>If the majority of our intelligence agencies areright about the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>numb<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ers, I think we can be sure that the Soviets wouldnot keep a covert missile force unless they had figured out not only howto keep it, but also how to keep it in readiness.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>For this reason, the verification process in thetreaty is virtually useless. The treaty contains only quantitative criteriafor the missiles to be destroyed, with no qualitative criteria at all.Thus the Soviet missiles to be destroyed could be factory rejects or evendummies, as well as those old aging delivery vehicles that we expect themto destroy, delivery vehicles, not the weapons, because, remember, thewarhead that will be removed from each of them can be bolted onto the SS-25which is not covered by this treaty.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Furthermore, all of us talk about the onsite inspectionthat takes place under this treaty only at specific places chosen by theSoviet Union and which they have identified beforehand.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Now, I hardly think that any reasonable person wouldexpect the Soviets to keep its covert missiles at a place they were goingto tell us we could look.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Now, it is highly significant that the Senate SelectCommittee on Intelligence, in its report to the Foreign Relations Committee,was extremely guarded in its assessment of the verifiability of this INFTreaty. The Intelligence Committee stated that the treaty was verifiableonly with regard to those declared sites, but bear in mind that the Sovietsare the ones doing the declaring.This means that we can verify the treaty only at sites where there is scantpossibility of a Soviet violation. It is the old shell game and the Sovietsare good at it.Other testimony showed that our chances of detecting a viola<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ion outside of those declared sites were about 1to 10. We would have to be astonishingly lucky, or the Soviet<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> would have to be incredibly careless, for us todetect a violation under those circumstances.Finally, even if a violation were detected, the Soviets would suffer noconsequences. No major arms control viola<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ion of the Soviets in the past has ever been corrected,not one time.For example, the Soviets have deployed a prohibited nationwide ABM systemincluding the capability to hand over incoming information to battle-managementradars and interceptors. Yet our own State Department has declined formore than 7 months to implement the 5-year compliance review mandated bythe ABM Treaty because we would have to declare, do you <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>not<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> know, that the Soviet Union is engaged in a materialbreach of the ABM Treaty. And it is a credit to this Senate and to thedistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committeethat my amendment yesterday was readily accepted and agreed to by themand approved by the Senate to require our Government to live up to theABM Treaty in that regard.So, that is what we run into with the State Department, the doubletalk,the reluctance.Arms control without compliance is nothing more than an illusion. Yet thistreaty contains no compliance regime whatsoever, except perhaps anotheruseless commission where we could go and express a strong protest, andthe Soviets sa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>y<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> ``ha, ha ha,'' and they have been saying ``ha, ha,ha'' every time we have gotten around to protesting their previous violationson previous treaties.The Soviets' only obligation is that they come to the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ommission meeting and they sit there and listen andwe protest, and they go home and smile at each other and say, ``We didit to them again.''The point is this: The Soviets have cheated and we have known it. Theyare cheating now and we know it. And they will continue to cheat. Thistreaty can have no other result. Yet the lack of a true compliance regimesignals to the Soviets that we do not intend to take their violations seriously.Even if we did, there is nothing we could do about it.The net effect then of the INF Treaty is to make both conventional andnuclear war more likely, not less likely. Eve<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the threat of a conventional attack on Europe willhave a profound effect on the so<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ial, political, and religious freedoms of Europe.The documented lack of freedom in Eastern Europe points to what could wellhappen in a Western Europe that is neutralized and int<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>midated by the elimination of the major NATO deterrentscalled for in the INF Treaty.In the end, the treaty invites either global nuclear war or acquiescenceto a future not worth looking forward to.So that is why I have contended all along, having sat down right at thebeginning when the treaty text was delivered to me in December, I concludedthen that it is fatally flawed and I have not changed my opinion. And thoseflaws fall into two categories.The first category consists of flaws which, on their face, defeat the principalobject and p<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ur<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>pose of the treaty. The second category consistsof those which raise the potential for action which coul<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> defeat the object and purpose of the treaty. And,finally, there are issues of constitutional and international law whichthe Senate must consider, including something that has been absolutelyobscured, and that is the cost_the cost_to the American taxpayers of implementingthis treaty.Madam President, the fatal flaws which defeat the principal object andpurpose of the treaty include the following:First, the treaty permits the Soviets to modernize the delivery vehiclesfor the SS-20 warheads_thereby retaining the same nuclear capability againstEurope_while eliminating the only assured nuclear deterrent possessed byNATO.Second, the verification procedures of the treaty provide no certaintyof discovering Soviet cheating, while_based on past Soviet performanceand present evidence_the Soviets may indeed have up to twice as many SS-20'sas they declare in the treaty. I have filed a top secret code word levelannex to the Senate Foreign Relations <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rep<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ort which is available to Senators and appropriatelycleared staff in <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>-407 of the Capitol.Third, the treaty is <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>over<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>broad in that it blocks not only future developmentsin nuclear weapons technology but in conventional technology as well, acircumstance scarcely, if at all, considered by the negotiators, despitethe fact that inventive technology is a major advantage of the United States.And that is what the Soviet Union was concerned about. Moreover, the treatyneedlessly surrenders nonnuclear weapons technology based on ground-launchedcruise missiles, in <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>an<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> illusory pursuit of verifiability_thereby givingup a relatively cheap and highly effective conventional deterrent weaponfor the defense of Europe.Fourth, the final data upon which the treaty is based will not be madeavailable until 30 days after the treaty is ratified, thereby making itpossible for the Soviets to make radical changes in the numbers of missilesto be destroyed, and defeating the already weak verification scheme.Faith, the very concept of the INF Treaty alone is untenable so long asthe Soviets maintain large inventories of ICBM del<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ivery<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> vehicles and warheads that can substitute for themissiles to be eliminated. And bear in mind that the Soviets and the UnitedStates will destroy only the delivery system and not the warhead. Until the START neg<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ot<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>iations are completed and implemented, Western Europewill still be targeted by Soviet nuclear weapons, but will have nonnucleardeterrent for its own security. To maintain balanced reductions, I thinkthat we should consider that the INF Treaty should not be ratified untilSTART likewise is ratified. Madam President, the cost of this treaty has not even been discussed inthe debate thus far and scarcely touched upon, if at all, by the majornews media of this country. Now, I am going to offer an amendment to this treaty at some point, ifit is ratified, that we begin to remove American servicemen and women andtheir dependents from Europe. The European leaders profess to be enthusiasticallyin favor of this INF Treaty. And I might add at the very time their subordinatesand their defense people were coming to us and saying, ``Boy, it's a terribletreaty.'' But they endorsed it because they are fearful of the protestmovements in Europe. So they have endorsed it. Fine. But I think it is about time <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>for <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Europe to defend itself and to pay for it. Let usstart bringing our men and women home and their dependents. Now, I wonder how many Americans know how much the taxpayers of this countryare paying to defend Europe. The figure is $477 million a day; 60 percent,60 percent of the Defense budget. So, we must consider that this treatycreates U.S. hostages in Europe at a cost of $477 million per day. There are only two good reasons to sign any arms control treaty. First,to reduce the risk of war and, second, to enhance the security of our country.Tragically, this treaty accomplishes neither purpose. The Soviets enjoy a decisive 5-to-1 margin of superiority over our forcesin Europe, on the basis of their strength in chemical and conventionalwarfare forces_five to one. Winston Churchill once said, ``Strength helps prevent war. Weakness invitesaggression.'' So I think it is self-evident that the danger of war is enhanced if thetotalitarians in the Kremlin see an opportunity to dominate Western Europeat minimal military risk for themselves. With the removal and destructionof our Pershing II missiles, we will surrender our ability to retaliateeffectively against Soviet aggression. We will no longer be able to holdat risk 2.5 million Communist troops, 40,000 Communist tanks, and 6,000Communist fighter aircraft. So with the elimination of our nonnuclear ground-launch cruise missiles,or GLCM's, as we call them, we will <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>no<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> longer be able to disrupt Soviet supply lines asa way of neutralizing the enemy'<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> ``blitzkrieg'' strategy.The Washington Times has pointed out that:[S17MY8-557]{S6027}<ITAG tagnum="21">Warsaw Pact supply routes in Eastern Europe contain thousands of chokepoints, most or all of which could be disrupted with non-nuclear cruisemissiles. Without those supply routes, Communist-bloc forces simply wouldbe stranded in the field.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Soviet and Warsaw Pact armies already have created the basic structure_bridges,roads, storage depots, airfields and fuel supplies_necessary to mount aEuropean invasion.</ITAG>Mr. President, ratification of this treaty will not promote peace nor willit enhance our security, or that of our allies. Quite the contrary, itwill require West Germany to deal with the new reality of Soviet dominancein Western Europe, 3 years from now, in 1991, when our deterrent forcehas been dismantled.Today in 1988, 325,000 American military personnel and 300,000 of theirdependents are on the frontiers of freedom in West Germany. Today thesemen and women have a clearly defined mission_to deter and, if necessary,to defeat a Soviet-initiated attack on Western Europe. In 3 years, however,if the INF Treaty is ratified and implemented, those 625,000 Americanswill have replaced our missiles as the main barrier to Soviet intimidationand aggression.Instead of using Pershings and GLCM's, we will be required to ward offthe Soviets with human hostages.Mr. President, twice in this century our troops have been sent to fight``no win'' wars, in Korea and in Vietnam. In both places, our Government'sgoal was not victory, but stalemate. Tens of thousands of our sons weresacrificed for the sake of State Department theories and diplomatic negotiations.Now in Western Europe we are once again about to sacrifice our childrenon the altar of arms control, de<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>andCx.174;1<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tente, and so-called ``limited war'' to test thosetheories.Instead of trusting in Almighty God and in our own strength, like Samsonwe will be shorn of that strength in order that we may embrace the newDelilah in the Kremlin.Despite an unbroken record of Soviet cheating on every treaty we have eversigned with our Communist enemy, the United States Senate may be aboutto entrust the lives of our children and the security of our country toyet another worthless piece of paper signed by an adversary who uses armscontrol to disarm us, and to strengthen his own position.Throughout my Senate career, which began 15 years ago in 1973, I have consistentlyvoted for every proposal put before me to strengthen America's defensesand to protect our vital interests throughout the world. Yet NATO has notresponded in kind.While the countries of Western Europe were spending only 5.1 percent andless of their gross national product on their own defense compared to our6.6 percent, the Senate was voting to assure that American would do more_not<ITAG tagnum="80">for their sakes, but for ours.</ITAG>In 1986, every American was taxed on the average $1,155 to pay for defensewhile West Germans were paying $453 apiece, citizens of Spain $113, theBritish $488, the Portuguese $90 apiece. We should pay to defend America,but we should not have to pay more to defend their countries than theyare willing to pay to defend themselves.President Eisenhower wrote in 1963, ``I believe the time has come whenwe should start withdrawing some of the U.S. troops. One American divisionin Europe can show the flag as definitively as can several.'' I<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> 1951, Eisenhower said if, in 10 years ``all Americantroops stationed in Europe have not been returned to the United States,then this whole project (i.e., NATO) will have failed.''So long as Europe could not afford to defend itself, U.S. troops in Europemade sense, and NATO played a positive role in securing the West. But thetroops were not intended to be permanently stationed in Europe. They wereviewed as an emergency measure that would remain in force only until Europerecovered from World War II.Twenty-five years later, we have not one division in Europe, but four.I have always been willing to do what was necessary for NATO as long asit made sense for America. But it will no longer make sense for Americato keep our troops and their dependents in Europe 40 years after the endof World War II at a cost of $477,000,000 per day, if we are unpreparedto defend those troops, and if they are not in a position to carry outsuccessfully the mission to which they were originally assigned.It would be unconscionable to leave our young people as hostages in Europe,knowing full well that if war breaks out, there is nothing America willor can do_and knowing full well that the Europeans will do nothing morethan they have done in the past to provide for their own defense.There is no question that the Europeans are economically equipped to providefor their own defense. They have more than ample people, money, and technology.But they have preferred to rely on the pocketbooks of American workersand the good will of the Soviet Union.What is most amazing is the European political leaders have permitted themselvesto be led like lambs to the slaughter, publicly supporting the INF Treatywhile privately condemning it. But the lack of forthrightness on anothercontinent is no excuse for the sacrifice of our children in another battleof Dunkirk in which the world watches as the surviving troops of the freeworld are hauled away in fishing boats.There is no question, Madam President, that the Europeans are economicallyequipped to provide for their own defense. So I say let them do it. Andremove from the backs of the A<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>me<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rican taxpayers the $477 million a day that it costsus to provide them with their defense. The Europeans have more than amplepeople. They have more than ample money and technology. But they have preferredto rely on the pocketbooks of the American workers and the good will ofthe Soviet Union.The decision by the United States Senate to ratify the INF Treaty willbe a decision to abandon Western Europe to the strategic hegemony of ourSoviet enemy and I am going to vote against ratification, even if I amthe only Senator to do so.I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Rhode Island.[S17MY8-558]{S6028}PELLMr. PELL. Madam Pres<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>dent, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from California.[S17MY8-559]{S6028}CRANSTONMr. CRANSTON. I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee verymuch.Madam President, today we embark on the Senate's first serious considerationof an arms control treaty in a good many years.Efforts in the past decade to make progress in this area have been derailedor derided by arms control critics. But I see real signs of progress. Abipartisan spirit and approach to arms control and an imp<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>rov<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ed climate in United States-Soviet relations giveme cause for hope_hope for a world more free of tension, hope for a worldfree from the threat of nuclear war.I believe we will, at long last, take a step in the right direction andratify the INF Treaty_I trust before the forthcoming United States-Sovietsummit.The Senate_thanks in large part to the determination of the majority leader_hasperformed a service of historic dimension by withholding Senate considerationof the treaty until now.He and Senators <T4>Nunn, Boren, </T4>and others demanded that a number of problems hadto be cleared up first. They have been cleared up.I agree with the majority leader that the Senate must not be held to anarbitrary deadline for ratification. But we must face reality. The realityis that on May 29, President Reagan will meet with Soviet leader Gorbachevin Moscow.The Pres<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ident<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> should not go to that meeting empty handed. Thereis no longer any justification for even considering that he go empty handed.Now is the time for action. We should approve this treaty. And we shouldapprove it without delay.This treaty is a historic agreement. Not in its direct effort, which isa modest reduction of the superpowers' bloated nuclear arsenals, but inthe hopeful signal and valuable experience it provides us for fut<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ure<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> arms control agreements.The INF Treaty is precedent-setting in several respects. The inspectionand verification provisions of this treaty are the most intrusive, detailed,and thorough that we have ever negotiated. This is a genuine breakthrough.And the most concete example of glasnost I have seen. Opening the SovietUnion to on-site inspection eliminates a major obstacle to arms limitationsand paves the way for dealing with the more difficult problems of monitoringdeep reductions in strategic arms.That is why it is so important to approve this treaty before the Presidentgoes to Moscow so that he will be able there to build on this foundationand move on to far more significant matters relating to arms and relatingto the American-Soviet relationship. The possibility of greatly improvingthis relationship and turning it to peaceful and constructive channelsis now within reach.The treaty is historic in other ways, too. It affects an entire class ofnuclear weapons, eliminating a <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>thr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>eat that has been in existence for decades.And most importantly, this is the first agreement that does more than justslow the increase of weapons. It will require that the Soviet Union andthe United States destroy a part of their arsenals.Three Senate committees, comprising nearly half the Members of the Senate,have heard thousands of pages of testimony from dozens of expert witnesseson the ramifications of the INF Treaty.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I want to pay tribute to the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee,the Senator now managing this measure, this treaty on the floor, for hispatience and diligence and hard and diplomatic work in guiding this treatythrough not only the Foreign Relations Committee, but through the otherdifficulties and pitfalls that stood in its way before we finally arrivedhere on the floor. I welcome the opportunity to work with them.The members of the Foreign Relations Intelligence, and Armed Services Committeeshave worked together to clarify ambiguities, to pin down definitions, andto urge the executive branch to remedy any potential discrepancies. Wehave poked and pried and dissected and questioned this treaty like no other.It is perhaps the most closely scrutinized treaty ever submitted for Senateconsideration.Given the complexity of this treaty and the accompanying protocols, itis remarkable there has been so little dispute over its specific substantiveprovisions. Those issues that have been raised, like recent clarificationson implementing the inspection procedures, have been resolved quickly andto our satisfaction. We have had a very capable negotiating team in Geneva,and a very capable Secretary of State at the helm.I believe the language of this treaty is as clear as human language willallow. There can be no dispute about the essential facts: The Soviets willdisable four times as many warheads as the United States. The treaty willestablish the precedent of aysemmetrical reductions. And our confidencein our ability to verify Soviet compliance is very high.Even after this treaty is fully implemented, there will continue to bemany, many areas for superpower competition. We have a long road to walkif we are to bring any semblance of control to the nuclear weapons competition.But, if we are fortunate, the implementation of this agreement will markthe beginning of the end of this mindless race to build better, more efficientand more numerous methods of destruction. Perhaps we can soon begin tothink of increasing our national security in terms of decreasing our arsenals,rather than adding ever more to the stockpile.Some have said that the INF Treaty will help the Soviet Union. Of courseit will. I've never heard of any nation that knowingly and without duresssigns a treaty that is contrary to its own self-interest. I think we mustpull ourselves out of the mindset that holds that anything good for theSoviet Union is necessarily bad for the United States. Increasing internationalsecurity, even increasing the Soviets' sense of security, can indeed makeAmerica more secure as well.It so happens that the treaty will help the United States as well as theSoviet Union. The fact is that the implementation of the treaty is overwhelminglyin our national interest. It is strongly supported by the citizens of thiscountry.It is also in the interest of our allies_not just in Europe but in Asiaand the Pacific as well. It received the unanimous endorsement of NATOleaders and high praise from NATO defense ministers.This treaty is a significant bipartisan achievement. I urge the Senateto ratify it without delay.The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.[S17MY8-560]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S6028}<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>DOLEMr. DOLE. Madam President, first I would urge all Senators who would liketo make opening statements: This is a good time to do it. We would liketo get into the meat of the process on tomorrow. I am certain the manager,the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and others, would liketo move ahead.We have been calling people on our side because today we enter the homestretch. We are finally on this treaty. There have been good reasons whywe have not started before,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and I think everybody has a right to be proud ofa job well done. As I have said before, the Senate has played a constructiverole. We had a constitutional role to play. We played that role, as most recentlydemonstrated in testimony just yesterday before the Foreign Relations Committee,Senator <T4>Pell's </T4> committee, by Secretary Shultz. He had been back to Genevanegotiating with the Soviets, clarifying some areas that had been raisedby who? By Members of the Senate. And now we have a better treaty thanwe had a week ago.I would guess others will find <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>mis<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>takes. And I guess over the next 10 or 15 years thereare going to be technical corrections and adjustments and understand<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ings<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and resolutions of differences between Soviets andAmericans. I do not quarrel with anyone who wants to vote against consenting to ratification.They have a perfect right to do that. I know some will do that. Obviously,some will want to offer amendments to the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>te<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>xt of the treaty, or others will want to offer reservationsor amendments or statements or declarations to the Resolution of Ratification.As far as I know, no one quarrels with that. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>But<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the point is we ought to do it, and do it as quicklyas we can.I know of no one in this body who wants to deny the President a hard-earnedright to take the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Ins<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>truments of Ratification to Moscow with him. I donot know of anybody on the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Dem<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ocratic side or anyone on the Republican side whohas not had enough time to understand the treaty. There have been thousandsof detailed questions, hundreds of witnesses, scores of hearings in threedifferent committees. Senators and staff from both sides of the ai<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>sle<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> have worked long and hard. I would guess there has never been a treaty that has been more closelyscrutinized than the one before the Senate right now.So I am going to stand here in a very positive way and predict that weare going to do this for the President_but<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> not<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> just for the President, for the country, for D<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>em<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ocrats, Republicans, and <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Ind<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ependents and all those pe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>op<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>le out there who may not be interested in politics,but who are concerned about their future, their children's future, andtheir grandchildren's future. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>We are not doing this because it is in the Soviets<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> interests. We are doing it because it is in ournational interests. I assume they have made the same judgment. They wouldnot do it if it was not in their national interest.We don't have to trust the Soviets, or trust Gorbachev, or trust anyoneelse. We have made a judgment. We have a lot of experts in this field whosay that this is a good treaty, and it is in our interests. That is thebottom line.[S17MY8-561]{S6029}negotiatin<ITAG tagnum="89">negotiating record valuable</ITAG>Senators and staff on both sides have spent countless hours studying thenegotiating record. I recall that when Senator <T4>Nunn </T4>first proposed Senate access to the negotiating record manywere skeptical. In retrospect I believe this was a positive developmentwhich should be repeated for all major treaties because with the benefitof the record the Senate has been able to develop its own clear idea ofwhat obligations the two parties proposed to undertake in the INF Treaty.[S17MY8-562]{S6029}concrete r<ITAG tagnum="89">concrete results</ITAG>All the work was worth it. When I told President Reagan I would supportthe treaty and make an effort to lead the effort for ratification, I alsotold him that I believed the Senate could improve upon an already goodproduct. As I have said a few moments ago, we did that just this past week,and we have done it in hearings, we have done it with statements, and wewill continue to work in this constructive way.Senators <T4>Nunn </T4>and <T4>Warner, </T4>and <T4>Quayle, </T4>and their Armed Services Committee colleagues led theway to defend and resolve the so-called futures issue. The result<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>is <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>diplomatic note signed by the United States and Sovietrepresentatives which is going to be part of the treaty.With Intelligence Committee insistence as backing, the administration wasable to press the Soviets for quick resolution on the nine onsite inspectionissues. Perhaps these were just some predictable glitches; perhaps not.But one way or the other the Soviets have been reminded that verificationis of paramount importance to us. We want to be able to verify the termsand conditions of this treaty.Again, we have a signed paper in hand. Chairman <T4>Boren </T4>and Vice Chairman <T4>Cohen, </T4>and their colleagues are to be thanked for this.Certainly the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, under the leadershipof Senator <T4>Pell, </T4>Senator <T4>Helms, </T4>Senator <T4>Lugar, </T4>and others, has contributed to making a record.[S17MY8-563]{S6029}the big pi<ITAG tagnum="89">the big picture</ITAG>So the Senate has made a difference but we have not reached the bottomline. I think the bottom line is to get this treaty behind us. It deservesour advice and consent.

The beneficiaries will be the American people. I think thatis how it is going to be perceived.This is <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>historic treaty, the first ever to reduce existingnuclear weapons. In fact, it eliminates two entire classes of them. Itsverification provisions are unprecedented, with onsite inspection, andthey are also effective.

Now there are other Members. They wantto be here; they want to ask questions; they want to make statements; theywant to offer whatever they are going to offer; they want to make theirpoints.

This is not just some academic exercise. Thisis a real world issue of huge importance and the world is watching whatwe do.

That gives us 7 or 8 solid workingdays.

We cannot now credibly assert that the treaty's meaning is based only onits text and executive testimony. This notion derives neither from theConstitution, nor from practical experience. In reality, it is rooted onlyin our disagreement over another treaty, another treaty not even beforeus, but insistence upon it will certainly delay this treaty.I do not believe that such delay is fitting to end the solid work we havedone. So I think we have to put the other differences aside and spend ourtime on the INF issues.[S17MY8-566]{S6029}let's get <ITAG tagnum="89">let's get to work</ITAG>It is time to roll up our sleeves and finish our work, and, as other speakershave said, there is absolutely no reason, unless something pops up thatnobody has t<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>h<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ought of_and there have been a lot of pretty goodminds, men and women, people in this country and outside this country thathave looked at this treaty, looked at it with an eagle eye_there is nogood reason why the President should not have this treaty to ratify inMoscow.When Ronald Reagan steps off Air Force One and onto Russian soil, I wantMr. Gorbachev to know that he is facing a man with a solid backing of Congressand the American people. That is what this is all about.So I am going to be working closely with the majority leader, who I thinkhas done an outstanding job, in making certain that we resolved some ofthese issues before coming to the floor. We have saved time this past week.And I know that some of my colleagues, as I have said, have differences.That is fine. Some will raise valid points, just as valid points were raisedon futures and on inspection and on other things. Maybe someone will finda real area that should be corrected. But I hope what we can do is to dowhat we have a reputation of doing around here, and that is being veryconstructive and not delaying. This is a Senate responsibility, but itis an issue that transcends this Chamber.Oh, it is important to the President. But it is important to the Americanpeople. It is important to free people around the world. It is importantto those who look to us for leadership all around the world. I think wewill have ample time.So in the next few days when we get into the nitty-gritty of this, we aregoing to have to stand up and be counted and move this treaty along. Ipledge the President of the United Stat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>es<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> my support, and I am going to do what I can in thenext several days to make certain that when he leaves the United States,he has what he needs in his pocket. I will be happy to yield whatever time he may consume to the Senator fromIdaho, but before I do, I also want to say, there is an excellent workon the Republican desks, which I am certain we can make available to theother side. It is a very objective, nonpartisan analysis of the reportsfrom the Foreign Relations, Armed Services, and Intelligence Committe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>es<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> on the treaty. It is a good summary, and I wantto congratulate Rob Soofer who is a staffer of the Republican Policy Committee.I am certain we will be happy to make copies available to either side.It is a good summary that puts it all in perspective. [S17MY8-567]{S6030}SYMMSMr. SYMMS addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho. [S17MY8-568]{S6030}SYMMSMr. SYMMS. I thank the distinguished Republican leader for not only hisremarks but his long service in this body and the other body and his priorservice to his country that is a record matched by very few people whohave served in this Senate. I must say that it has been a privilege for me to be one of his supportersin his recent poli<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>tic<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>al endeav<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>or<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s and still one of his supporters. I hope to be onhis team here in the Senate, even though on this particular issue whenI take the floor, I am not coming down on the same side of the issue asour distinguished Republican leader. Mr. President, in getting into my remarks, it is not the intention of thisSenator to in any way delay the deliberations that the Senate must do inits r<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>es<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ponsibilities to advise and consent and to eventuallyratify this treaty. My point is I wish to make my case to my colleagues in the best fashionI know how. Ultimately, we will have a vote, and I think there is muchto do about the fact that the President should have this treaty with him,if it is going to be ratified, prior to the time he makes his journey tothe Soviet Union. I suppose that one might take the rather philosophical approach to it,whether you are for or against this treaty, that probably there will notbe many votes changed by what is said here in this Chamber in the next2 weeks. I do think, historically looking at this, that in the course of history,it is rather irrelevant President Reagan has the treaty in his pocket totake to Moscow with him to meet the dictator of the Soviet Union, Mr. Gorbachev,or whether he does not. But I think also that it is probably not too significantin the course of history whether we vote on the treaty prior to his goingor after he goes, unless there is something else that may come out, althoughI said all along I thought the time eventually was on the side of thosepeople who are in opposition to this treaty.But I think in many ways, it might be said that this was a fait accompliwhen the treaty was originally signed last December. I might say one thing about President Reagan and his administration, whosuccessfully negotiated this treaty<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>:<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> President Reagan demonstrated that it takes morethan just rhetoric to have the confidence and credibility not only of ourallies, but the respect of our adversaries; that it takes a strong politicalwill.That is probably the most important factor in negotiating with authoritariangovernments for those of us who come from free societies, from the democraticprocess, from countries which aspire to democratic capitalism, personalfreedom, human rights and human dignities. What we must remember is thatthe one single thing that is key and most important in negotiating withthe dictatorships and the authoritarians and those people who stay in powerby using oppression and tyranny and fear, such as the Soviet Union, thatthe best way to negotiate with them is from a position of strength.So I think this President deserves the praise and admiration of all Americansbecause he negotiated from a position of strength. I have to say that it was not the left-wing politicians in Europe frommore liberal parties who made it possible for the Pershing II's and thecruise missiles to be deployed. It was not the more liberal politicianshere in this body and in the other body who made it possible. It was theconservatives in America and people who knew that we had to deal from aposition of strength who gave the President the political will to use thepolitical chips in Western Europe, to make those early deployments in hisadministration of the Pershing II and the cruise missile, that made itpossible to get to the point where the Soviets would come to the tableto sign an agreement to get weapons systems out of Europe that they feltwere a deterrent to Soviet hegemony and to the ultimate Soviet goal ofbreaking up the NATO alliance and pealing West Germany off from the allianceif they could do it.Strength is the key. It takes political will, it takes economic strength,and it also takes a commitment to military strength to back it up. It iscommon sense.My basic political philosophy with respect to foreign policy is that youshould support your friends and oppose your enemies. Pretty easy to understand,pretty simple to understand, and I think that the problem I have foundwith this entire process since this big rush toward arms control in thisadministration is that probably the most significant thing that has happenedin the signing of the INF Treaty is the fact that we got away from thatpolicy of supporting our friends and opposing our enemies.We have strengthened the political parties that are more socialistic, moresympathetic to the Communist bloc nations, less sympathetic to personalfreedom, less sympathetic to economic freedom, less sympathetic to democraticcapitalism and have weakened the position of the political leaders in Europewho have been in support of President Reagan's general philosophy thathas been growing around the world.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>I think when one looks at the economic growth that we have enjoyed in thiscountry in the past 6 years of uninterrupted recovery, that that also hashad a sustaining effect as part of the political will, the military strength,and the economic strength that we have been able to enjoy in the West underthe leadership of the President.So I say to President Reagan that I have the highest respect for his abilityto get to the point that we signed the INF Treaty and th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>at<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the Soviets were willing to deal with them, Mr.President. But I do think that the future now is more uncertain becauseI think that the United States of America has, by taking this action, emboldenedthe political parties who were viewed as our adversaries and have weakenedthose people who we viewed as our friends in the long haul in politicsin Europe.But having said that, I said last December that I would lay aside my preconceptionsand doubts that I had about the treaty, and approach the treaty's ratificationwith an open mind. Even though I had great skepticism, as my colleaguesknow, I had great skepticism of all of the love in that took place herein Washington. And I might just say with respect to that that I hope afterthis summit when President Reagan goes to Moscow that we in the UnitedStates, no matter who our President is, whether it is <T4>George Bush,</T4> Michael Dukakis, or whoever, will encourage the administrationsof the future to not have home and home series summits where great expectationsare billed to the American people, that somehow, something must be accomplishedevery year.I would much prefer to see the leader of the United States, the Presidentof the United States of America, the leader of the free world, an electedofficial, meet with the leader of the Soviet Union, an oppressive society,in a neutral court so we do not have this opportunity for the Soviets_whoare masters of using the free press that they could not give to their peoplein their country_but that we do not give them just a free ride to paintthemselves in the picture that somehow everything has changed in the SovietUnion, and now that Gorbachev is in power they now have stopped state-supportedterrorism, which they have not; that they have withdrawn from Afghanistan,which we pray that <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>th<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ey will, but they have not; that they stopped fundingCommunist revolutionary governments in Central America, all across Africa,and creating hegemony and terrorism against innocent civilians in placeslike Pakistan and many other places in the world, which they are stilldoing.I think in many ways we allow ourselves, because Americans in general loveto think that everything is going to be all right because we are optimistic,we are goal oriented. So what happens is that election time is rollingaround, the administration therefore decides that it is time to get a treatybecause after all the President is going to be leaving town, and we willpush for this. It happens with every administration no matter whether theyare Republicans, Democrats or what. There is always a time constraint builtinto our constitutional system because we know under the Constitution howlong a President will be in office, or how long at least he has to go backand face reelection.There is a pressure on those of us from the West to make a deal just likethere is a pressure on the Senate. Let no one make a mistake. There isa pressure on this Senate to allow the President the privilege to go toMoscow with that treaty, ratified or not ratified. But there is a pressureon the Senate to get out of the way, let the thin<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> happen because otherwise there would be all kindsof stories written in the newspapers and in the television, in the radiosand so forth, that some<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>how<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> everything was going to pot at River City becausethe Senate could not ratify the treaty on time.So we do have this pressure. The Soviets do not have the same problem becauseif people start objecting too much in that country, they ship them offto Siberia. I would say to my colleagues the ultimate test, of course,of a free country, or a country that is really opening up, is that theystop killing people at the border if they choose to leave. And the ultimatetest of a free society is you can liquidate your assets, get your money,get your passport and leave. As long as you live in a country that willallow that privilege, you are very, very lucky human beings. I think weshould all count our blessings that we are blessed to live in this greatland.But anyway, Mr. President, I tried my best to be true to the promise thatI would face this with an open mind. I listened carefully to a multitudeof witnesses who testified before the Armed Services Committee, both proand con. And I read and considered innumerable articles and reports concerningthe treaty and the effects that it will have. But first and foremost Iwanted to be convinced that the INF Treaty enhanced our national security,and was in the best interests of this Nation. I wanted to be convincedthat we had reached a point in our relationship with the Soviet Union wherewe had achieved a mutual understanding based on openness, candor, and apoint where the balance of terror was no longer considered a meaningfulphrase.I wanted to be convinced that the loss of more than 6\1/2\ billion dollarsworth of American taxpayers' dollars had been spent on intermediate nuclearforces was equal to the gain and security represented by the treaty.Finally, I wanted to be convinced that as a result of the treaty our future,the future of our alliances and our allies' future, indeed the future ofthe world as a whole, would be brighter and more secure.Unfortunately, Mr. President, I am not convinced that is what has happened.All I have seen and heard from the proponents of the treaty can probablybe summed up in the following manner. First, it will support our overallstrategy by reducing risks. Second, it will strengthen our alliances. Third,it will decrease the Soviet military advantage. Finally, it will do allof this in a manner which provides assurances of verification.All of us I think agree that the reduction of risk is a very, very importantgoal, a goal worthy of our best efforts. However, I have a difficult timewith the treaty that purports to reduce the risks but lowers the pointwhere a nuclear exchange is likely to take place, and also fails to addressthe overwhelming Soviet conventional superiority in Europe.Mr. President, I filed minority views in the Armed Services Committee report.They are probably too lengthy. There is so much to say. I apologize tomy colleagues because they are so lengthy. But at this point I just wantto read one brief little page 82 from that report about the conventionalforces that the Soviets and the Warsaw Pact have over NATO. The Soviet Warsaw Pact has a 2-to-1 advantage in main battle tanks; 2.3-to-1advantage in heavy artillery; 1.3-to-1 advantage in armored personnel carriers;1.2-to-1 advantage in tactical aircraft; 2.4-to-1 advantage in interceptoraircraft; 6-to-1 advantage in the intermediate range bombers; and a 25-to-1advantage in chemical decontamination equipment. And get this, Mr. President,the Soviet Warsaw Pact has 700,000 tons to zero in modern deliverable chemicalmunitions.I think we have some 10 or 11 air bases with the flexible reponse aircraftdeployed in Europe that will have to take up part of the slack, for thelack of the Pershing II's and the Cruise missiles.That is a tremendous burden that it puts on our tactical and our non-nucleardeterrrence in Western Europe.In my opinion, that means it in itself will increase the potential fora disastrous strategic exchange with the Soviet Union. It is not a reductionof the risk. It is a grievous miscalculation.Why are we willing to accept a situation which permits our adversariesto retain their capability to engage the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>inter<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mediate targets with their SS-24 and SS-25 mobilemissile forces while we surrender only our own ground-based nuclear capability?Many of my colleagues would cite our strategic missile force and our dualcapable aircraft or even our sea-launched Cruise missiles as a way to offsetour INF losses. But they do not acknowledge the inherent vulnerabilitiesof each of those systems which in my mind creates a serious question regardingthe usefulness in the INF role.Are we not being really less than candid when we suggest the use of strategicweapons to counter a Warsaw Pact attack against NATO without also admittingthe tremendous risk of a follow-on strategic nuclear exchange?Let us be honest about it. Do you believe we will fire an MX missile fromthe continental United States to retarget targets that now Pershing IImissiles are capable of hitting? If you flip this on the other side ofthe coin, the Soviets can replace the SS-20's with SS-24's and SS-25'swhich they are going to retarget the same targets in Europe. So we do nothave any targets in Europe that still are not under the same threat. Butthey still are firing those from the homeland of the Soviet Union intoEuropean targets, but not into United States targets. So we should thinkabout that.I want to point out another question. I visited Europe in January, visitedwith many of our military leaders, and asked them many questions aboutit. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Of<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> course, the party line there is that they can livewith the INF if we modernize all our tactical and other weapons and keepour position strong enough to have a flexible response.It is interesting to note, however, that Spain is trying to throw out 72of our dual capable F-16 aircraft from there, and we will have to lookfor another home for them.It is also interesting to note that when we state the case that we canuse dual capable aircraft, I say to my colleagues, and particularly thosewho may not have thought through what a dual capable aircraft is, it isone that is used in a tactical battle but wh<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ich<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> still has the capability of the nuclear deliverysystem to use if all else fails.    If we have to withhold those aircraft from an ensuing land battle becausewe are fearful that we will lose them and we might have to have them, weonly weaken the hands of our commanders who will need everything they canto stop the armored columns. So if aircraft are withheld from the initialland battle in order to be able to be held in reserve to conduct a nuclearstrike, in my view we have complicated our ability to deal with that landbattle as well as our need to achieve and maintain air superiority, andconsequently increased the possibility of an early tactical nuclear exchange. The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, the Chair points outthat the time <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>avail<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>able to the Republican leader has expired.

Mr. President, are we not really overstat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>in<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>g the case to suggest the use of dual capable aircraftto redress the INF problem. Afterall, if those aircraft are withheld fromthe initial land battle in order to conduct a nuclear strike, haven't wejust complicated both our ability to deal with that land battle, as wellas our need to achieve and maintain air superiority and consequently, increasedthe possibility of an early tactical nuclear exchange? Where then is thereduction in risk. I, for one, can't find it.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>With regard to the premise that the treaty will serveto strengthen our alliances, I think it is very disturbing to note thatmany Europeans view the treaty as an unwelcome return to the insecurityof the seventies, when the only response available to NATO, in the eventof a massive Soviet invasion of Europe, was a United States strategic nuclearattack on the Soviet homelan<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d;<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> an all or nothing response which most Europeansfelt was a sham. Except, in the current case, the situation is even worsedue to the tremendous increases in the quality and quantity of Soviet forcestargeted against Western Europe.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>In fact, the treaty not only dislocates the strategyof <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>fl<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>exible respon<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>se<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> which has served NATO well for so many years, butit fails to address the massive Soviet land force advantage in cental Europe.In my view, the only thing the treaty accomplishes in this area is themagnification of the Soviet Union's threat to Europe, while simultaneouslydiminishing NATO's ability to deter that threat.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Already voices in Western Europe can be heard hailingthe treaty as the first step in the drive toward a European nuclear freezone. Political pressure has started to build in Germany to slow down,reevaluate, and possibly do away with the Montebello modernization program.Have not Gennescher, Shevarnahdze, Hornecker, and others already met andbegun discussion of eliminating all remaining nuclear weapons in both Eastand West Germany. Where then is the strengthening, the solidifying, thereinforcing nature of the treaty. I, for one, cannot find it. On the contrary,I believe the treaty calls into question the credibility of both our politicaland military commitments to Western Europe. As Mr. Benoist and many otherprominent Europeans have recently concluded:<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S17MY8-576]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S6032}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="21"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Far from enhancing Western security, we believe theINF Agreement would shift the military balance in favor of the Warsaw Pactand </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">assist the Soviet Union in seeking to include political changes inthe West favorable to its interests. At the same time, the proposed accordwould diminish any incentive for the Soviet Union to make fundamental changesin its domestic and foreign policies. We are also fearful that it wouldweaken the credibility of the United States nuclear gurantee to Europe,sow discord within the alliance, and seriously erode the reputation andinfluence of the United States, upon which free societies remain criticallydependent.</ITAG><CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Now let us turn our attention to the propositionthat the treaty decrea<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ses<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the Soviet's military advantage. Over the courseof the last 40 years, we have successfully deterred the Soviets from attemptinga military conquest of Western Europe. That deterrence was the direct resultof the Soviet's perception of our strength and our willingness to use thatstrength on behalf of our NATO allies. Our willingness to develop an INFforce and deploy it forward in Europe and our alli<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>es'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>will<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ingness to base those weapons on their soil onlyserved to further strengthen NATO, while reinforcing the credibility ofour deterrent. With the adoption of the INF Treaty our ``equalizer'' isgone. Rem<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>em<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ber that General Rogers, in his testimony beforethe Armed Services Committee, cautioned ``keep in mind that for NATO'sdeterrent to be credible it must conjure up in the Soviet mind a perceptionof greater <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>pain<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> than gain from pact aggression'' * * * <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>and <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>then we went on to state that ``what the Sovietsare eliminating comprises only about 3 percent of their stockpile of nuclearwarheads. Nearly all of the remaining 97 percent can be targeted againstinstallations in NATO's rear areas, thereby keeping the risk high and onthe backs of the West European people. And what does NATO give up? Thevery weapon system the Soviets fear most_the Pershing II_which puts theSoviet homeland and people in a similar posture of vulnerability and keepshigh the credibility of NATO's deterrent.'' Where then is the decreasein the Soviet's military advantage? I, for <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>one<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, cannot find it.Any overlaying all of these issues is the real centerpiece of the INF Treaty;the verification clause. Please excuse me Mr. President, I misspoke, Idid not mean to say verification. What I meant to say was trust, the trustclause, for that is what it means. Like many of my colleagues, I too wasconcerned with the meaning of verification so I w<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ent<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to what I considered to be the most authoritativesource available_Webster's third new international dictionary. Webster'sdefines the word <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>``<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>verification<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>''<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> as_and I quote_``The act or process of verifyingor the state of being verified: the authentication of truth or accuracyby such means as facts, statements, citations, measurements, or attendantcircumstances.''Using that definition as a basis, I reviewed the report of the Select Committeeon Intelligence entitled ``Monitoring and Verificat<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ion<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> Capabilities'' where I found the following admission``with respect to assessing the accuracy of the numbers and locations offorces and systems declared by the Soviets in the treaty's <ITAG tagnum="80">memorandum of understanding, the intelligence community has not resolvedsignificant differences of view over the possibility that the Soviets maynot have disclosed their entire inventory of nondeployed SS-20 missil<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>es<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>*<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>*<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>*<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> their potential military significance woul<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> howeve<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> be short-lived. This is because the operationalreliability and military utility of any covertly maintained miss<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>il<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>es would begin to deteriorate immediately; wouldseriously degrade during the first 3 years, when all miss<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>il<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>es are being eliminated; and would vanish entirelywithin a decade, unless the Soviets can b<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>eg<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>in flight testing them. </ITAG>This would be both illegal and readily detectable.'' I think that statementis amazing. Not only does it admit that we don't know how many SS-20 miss<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>il<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>es the Soviets have, and implies the Soviets aredeliberately misleading us, but it goes on to understate the seriousnessof that threat while justifying a decade of our own vulnerability. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Th<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>at, Mr. President, is why this clause should be entitledthe trust clause not the ve<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ri<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>fication clause. We are being asked to trust theSoviet Union because we can't verify the treaty. Trust the same nationthat has violated every arms control treaty it has ever signed. Trust thenation that invaded Afghanistan. Trust the nation that still subjugatesEastern Europe and trust the nation that was responsible for shooting andkilling Maj. Arthur Nichols. If that is verification Mr. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Pr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>esident, I, for one, cannot find it a<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>nd<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> if its a <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ba<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>sis for trust, I most certainly cannot find thateither. Given the fallacies and serious shortcomings of this treaty, why is theresuch a burning desire to place this Nation at risk. Why is there such awillingness to look past the realities of Soviet behavior and actions inthe world and instead focus on the mythology of ``perestroika'' and thep<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>er<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>sona of Gorbachev. I do<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ot<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> have those answers Mr. President, only a hope. Ahope that my colleagues will not succumb to ``it's a rotten treaty butits the only one we got'' mentality_to that reverse logic which decreesthat despite all risk and in the face of solid e<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>vi<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>dence to the contrary, too much political capitalhas been invested for NATO to stand together if the Senate voted no. My hope is that my colleagues will <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>vo<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>te to address the realities and not their wishes.Treaty ratification should not be based on public relations skill, naiveexpectations or unrealistic assumptions. It is never to late to walk awayf<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ro<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>m a bad deal. Therefore, Mr. President, I will castmy vote against ratification of the INF Treaty and urge my colleagues todo likewise, for if this treaty represents more security, a new relationshipwith the <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>So<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>viet Union based on candor, a meaningful reductionin the ``balance of terror'' and a brighter future for our world, I, forone, cannot find it.   <CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>[S17MY8-577]{S6033}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S17MY8-578]{S6033}MESSAGES F<ITAG tagnum="81">MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT</ITAG>Messages from the President of the United States were communic<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ted to the Senate by Ms. Emery, one of his secretaries.[S17MY8-579]F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="59">0[S17MY8-580]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S6033}<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>EXECUTIVE <ITAG tagnum="81"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED</ITAG>As in executive session, the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate messagesfrom the President of the United States submitting a nominatio<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.(The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate proceedings.)[S17MY8-581]{S6033}F<ITAG tagnum="66">F</ITAG>[S17MY8-582]{S6033}MESSAGES F<ITAG tagnum="81">MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE</ITAG>At 2:22 p.m.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> a message from the House of Representatives, deliveredby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has passedthe following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:[S17MY8-583]{S6033}4471.<ITAG tagnum="21">H.R. 4471.

Mr. President, thus far in the 100th Congress, a plethoraof child care bills have been introduced_more than 50 bills in all. Mostare constructive; many are innovative. Indeed, I am proud to cosponsorseveral of these bills, including S. 1885, the Act for Better Child CareServices, along with Senators <T4>Dodd, Cranston, </T4>and <T4>Chafee. </T4>The flaw in all of these bills, however, is that noneoffers an immediate response to the rapidly expanding crisis in Americanchild care services. what's more, amidst the cacophony and confusion ofso many alternative proposals, there is a very real danger that the legislativeoverload will paralyze Congress, preventing any action this year. Thatwould be the ultimate irony and tragedy of so many well-intentioned proposals.Mr. President, to cut through this legislative gridlock, Senator <T4>Hatfield</T4> and I are introducing the Child Care Act of 1988. Theprincipal thrust of our bill is to provide a direct and immediate shotin the arm for child care services in all 50 States. To that end, we proposeboosting authorization for title XX of the Social Security Act by $1.5billion over 3 years, earmarking that increase exclusively for child careservices.By all means, let the Congress continue to debate the optimum approachesto child care services. No doubt, to<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, child care will be a major issue in the congressionaland presidential campaigns. But we cannot allow the children's needs togo unmet for another year while the adults quibble and kibitz. Let's getthe money to grass-roots community organizations that need it and knowhow to make best use of it. And let's do it now.Mr. President, our bill also includes two other components. First, to businessesthat establish child care facilities, it provides a tax credit of 25 percentof the cost, not to exceed $50,000; this tax credit will leverage Federalresources by enlisting the private sector in the rapid expansion of ourNation's day-care infrastructure. Second, to facilitate the inquiry intoa long-term legislative solution to the child care crisis, our bill establishesa bipartisan commission ot conduct a 1-year study of our Nation's day-careneeds.Mr. President, the States already have in place a remarkable variety oftitle XX-funded child care programs and services. These programs are attunedto local needs and preferences. They have a wealth of practical experience.They have the know-how to expand rapidly. All they lack is funding commensuratewith the vast unmet needs of the American public.Total title XX grants to States currently stand at $2.7 billion, of whichapproximately $1 billion is allocated <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>to<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> providing child care. My bill would increase titleXX funding by $1.5 billion over 3 years<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>_<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>$300 million in 1989, $500 million in 1990, and $700million in 1991<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>_<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>and would expressly earmark that entire sum for childcare services.I say, let's stop beating around the bush on child care. The hour is toolate. The crisis is too destructive to be addressed with half-measuresand nickle-and-dime initiatives. The time has come to start putting ourmoney where our mouth is.And that, Mr. President, is the chief virtue of the Child Care Act of 1988.We make no bones about its cost. We acknowledge up front that this billentails a significant new commitment of Federal resources. We say simply:it is time for Congress to explicitly identify quality child care as avital and urgent national priority.Mr. President, as I said, our bill also provides for creation of a NationalAdvisory Commission on Child Care, which would be tasked with undertakingthe most extensive<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="80">study of this problem since 1970. We have a vast range of proposalson the table: From the Secretary of Education, from the Secretary of Labor,from various committees in Congress, from think-tanks and child advocacygroups. The <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Com<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mission will have 1 <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>year <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>to sift through these many proposals, hold hearings,and hammer out a consensus package of public and privaste-sector solutions.The <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Com<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mission will be bipartisan, as will its recommendations.Much on the model of the Social Security study chaired by Alan Greenspanin the early 1980s, the Child Care Commission's task will be to c<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ry<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>stalize a consensus and mobilize public support behinda bipartisan legislative solution. </ITAG>Mr. President, the American people are way out in front of Congress intheir support for child care legislation_and in their willingness to footthe bill for solutions. An ABC-Washington Post poll last year determinedthat 57 percent of Americans believe that child care programs should beincreased; this compares to 44 percent the year before. A recent Harrispoll found <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>that<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> 73 percent of Americans would be willing to increasetheir taxes to pay for improved child care. There are many reasons for this groundswell of public support. All havetheir roots in the rapidly changing demographics of the last 15 to 20 years.Today, half of all married mothers with infants younger than 1 year oldalso hold <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>down<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> jobs; this is a 108 percent increase since 1970.By 1995, two-th<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>irds<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> of all preschool children will have working mothers;four out of five school-age chidren will have working mothers. Of course, all things being equal, it would be wonderful if all mothershad the option of staying at home with their young children. The factsof life, however, are that some 70 percent of employed mothers work notas a matter of choice but as a matter of pressing economic need. Even so,the average income of two-p<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>arent<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> families with children actually <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>declined 3.1 percent between 1973 and 1984. The response to these demographics has been woefully <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>inadequate_to the point where, today, child carein America is not just a national crisis, it is a national disgrace. Inmany communities, the demand for infant care exceeds the available supplyby three to one, or worse. For lack of alternatives, millions of parentsleave their children in child care situations they realize are less thansatisfactory, if not dangerous. Millions of low-income parents_especiallysingle parents_face <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>the <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>terrible choice of placing their children in potentiallyharmful situations or forgoing employment and training opportunities becausethey cannot afford child care. Employers pay a price, too, in the coinof absenteeism and reduced productivity of workers who are distracted bychild care problems. Meanwhile, the typical cost of full-time child care in our major metropolitanareas is $3,000 per <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>year <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>for each child. That equals one-third the annualp<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>verty-level income for a family of three. No wonderstudies show that lack of affordable child care is a key reason why manyparents don't work or can work only part time. Likewise, too many youngcouples face the cruel choice of either foregoing the blessings of parenthoodor suffering the pain and indignity of providing only inadequately fortheir preschoolers' needs.  Mr. Presid<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ent,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the statistics are impressive. Likewise, there <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>are<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> countless excellent economic arguments in favorof national child care legislation. They all pale, however, in light ofthe one all-important consideration: The needs of our children. Our firstquestions must be: What is best for the children? What is the minimum thatwe as a society owe to our children?  Surely the minimum standard must begin with child care services in whichthe children of working parents are safe, healthy, and well-nourished.In addition, child care facilities can and should provide kids with <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>the <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>foundation they need to build toward success in school.Indeed, in many<ITAG tagnum="80">instances, child care facilities are equipped to give children thekind of enriched developmental atmosphere that not all mothers and fathersare able to provide.</ITAG>These educational opportunities are inherently worthwhile. They contributeto richer, more productive, more satisfying lives. But_for the more literalminded_we can also quantify the payoffs; we can attach dollar figures.According to a staff report of the House Select Committee on Children,Youth, and Families, $1 invested in preschool education returns $4.75 insavings because of lower special education and welfare costs, and higherworker productivity.Late last year, the results of a landmark 10-year study by Syracuse Universitywere published. Echoing earlier studies, the Syracuse team found that low-incomechildren who received intensive day care and family services during theirfirst 5 years had sharply lower delinquency rates, higher levels of self-esteem,and better school performance in adolescence than a similar group of childrenwho received no services. Mr. President, these impressive results pointto the payoffs and potential of quality care in America.And there is more, Mr. President. Low-income children who participatedin the Syracuse study had a <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>6-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>percent rate of juvenile delinquency compared toa 22<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>-<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>percent rate for children in a control group. Overtime, court and detention costs were $12,000 for the program group comparedwith $107,000 for the control group. These findings point up the true costof our continued tolerance of the destructive status quo.Even so, despite the overwhelming and urgent need for child care legisla<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ti<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>on, it is inevitable that there will be concern aboutthe $1.5 billion price tag of this bill. Certainly, this is a legitimateconcern.This Senator yields to no one in his concern about the Federal deficits.I have always said: Decide what Government services you must provide, thenpay the bills. And I have advocated specific taxes and fees to bring Federalaccounts back into balance.But by the same token, it is a gutless abdication of responsibility topoint to the deficits and say, ``Our hands are tied. We cannot respondto the most basic needs of our citizens.'' That is a cop-out. It is theopposite of leadership. It is the opposite of all that is good about publicservice.By all means, we must be rigorous and tough-minded in setting nationalpriorities. But, once identified, those fundamental national prioritiesmust be met. And surely, by any sane and reasonable calculation, our childrenmust come first. We must not cheat the children.Mr. President, I look forward to championing this authorizing legislationon the Senate floor. And I intend to lead the campaign to win full fundingfor this expanded title XX bill in the fiscal year 1989 budget.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213>[S17MY8-600]<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>{S6035}<CODE-213>1</CODE-213>HATFIELD<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, much attention has beengiven to the child care crisis faced by a great many Amer<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>can families. Alliances formed by child care professionals,child welfare advocacy groups and working parents have initiated broad-rangingdiscussions of the problems associated with child care and have suggestedlegislative options.Of cours<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e, <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the child care problems facing working parents arenot new but they are growing as more and more American mothers enter theworkforce. Nationwide, fewer than 10 percent of all families have a motherwho stays at home with the children while the father works. Not only aremore mothers going to work, they also are going to work when their childrenare younger. For example, more than half of the mothers of children underthe age of <CODE-213>5</CODE-213> 6 <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>in Oregon are now in the labor force. This is thefastest-growing segment of the work force, and the sub<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>gr<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>oup of mothers with children under the age of <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>1<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> is expanding fastest of all. Many of these familieshave experienced first<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>hand one or more of three problems most often mentionedby advocates: the lack of accessibility, the lack of affordable and thelack of quality child care.Lack of affordable child care appears to be the preeminent concern. Childcare for one pre-schooler averages $2,400 per year_almost one-half of thegross annual income of a full-time minimum wage worker. In Oregon, whereone-fourth of all families with a child under age 6 live below the povertylevel, such an expense could force more families to slip onto the welfarerolls. Without reasonably-priced child care, many families may never makethe move to self-sufficiency. A study conducted in 1986 by the Oregon Adultand Family Services Division showed that 20.1 percent of the Aid to DependentChildren clients identified day care problems as a major barrier to findingor keeping employment.We know that problems exist within our Nation's child care system but wedo not know how to deal with them. We are faced with differences of opinionwith discussions about current child care reform and assistance proposalsranging from philosophical debates regarding the Federal role to grapplingwith the basic problem posed by the Federal deb<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t; <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>namely, how do we pay for a new program? We willhave to address the child care crisis issue on a broad scale but untilwe do we cannot allow lower-income families to suffer our indecisiveness.As a response to the urgent need for action, today Senator <T4>Hollings</T4> and I are introducing the Child Care Act of 1988. I amgreatly appreciative for the opportunity to work with my friend from NorthCarolina, who is best described as a realist possessing great compassionand vision. As a fellow former <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Go<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>vernor, Senator <T4>Hollings</T4> understands how a partnership of State and Federal governmentscan most effectively and efficently deliver vitally-needed services. TheChild Care Act uses that partnership to provide interim services to low-incomefamilies. With this legislation we seek to provide <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>down<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> pa<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>yment on the effort to end the child care crisis.In so doing, we also seek to renew our commitment to finding a solution.In addition to providing a desperately-needed injection of funds, the billcreates an advisory commission to assist in the development of a blueprintfor a Federal child care initiative and also provides tax incentives forbusinesses who provide child care. I want to emphasize that this legislationis limited by design and intended only to give temporary relief to someof our neediest working families. This bill is not a cure but it will giveus the opportunity to roll up our sleeves and dig into the issues as. Iurge all my colleagues to join Senator <T4>Hollings</T4> and me in calling for swift passage of the Child CareAct of 1986.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="63"/><ITAG tagnum="18">By Mr. BENTSEN:<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>S. 2405.

No one is suggestingthat the United States-Mexico Border Regional Commission will have thepower or resources to bring prosperity to the border, but I am convincedit can help set the stage for economic development. It can help us overcomeinertia, solve problems, and realize the potential of the region. Here is a classic example of how our public and private sectors can worktogether to solve problems in America. The way I see it, the Regional Commissionwould help direct resources toward infrastructure, education, and publichealth. It can be the catalyst that sparks private sector interest andinvestment in an area rich in opportunity.

Mr. President, I am introducing today legislationthat will address a problem along the United States-Mexican border, andit will solve some significant problems in my State. This bill will helpto solve the problem of pollution in the Rio Grande River, that body ofwater which in some places serves as a border between the United Statesand Mexico. For Texas, the Rio Grande, meaning literally the ``Big River,''has helped to provide nourishment and given life for generations. Thatis beginning to change. It is now the source of some serious health andenvironmental problems in the border area. That is caused principally bythe continuous dumping of raw sewage into the river. Mr. President, cleaning up our <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>Na<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tion<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>'<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s rivers and streams has been a national interestof the highest order for some years now. The Rio Grande has been neglectedin that effort. The large volume of raw sewage, garbage, and industrialwastes routinely dumped into the river has so polluted the Rio Grande thatit will take unusual and substantial efforts to sanitize it. The International Boundary and Water Commission provides me with a monthlyreport on the status of border sanitation problems. I have been lookingat those reports for a good while now. There is rarely any change. Themost distressing problem is that every day at several points along theborder tens of millions of gallons of raw, untreated sewage is dumped intothe river. In one spot, Nuevo Laredo, just across the border from Laredo,TX where hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens live, some 25 million gallonsof raw sewage is discharged directly into the river every single day. Now,this has got to stop.This legislation, which has been passed by the House, is a way to takesome control of the situation. Briefly, this legislation authorizes theSecretary of State, through the U.S. Commissioner, International BoundaryWater Commission, to enter into talks with the appropriate Mexican officialsto arrive at solutions for correcting the pollution problems in the river.The solutions should be embodied in agreements between the two countries,and steps to implement those agreements should be undertaken with dispatch.Mr. President, I only recently returned from the border area talking withofficials and just ordinary citizens there. Listening to their problems,hearing their recommendations for ways to solve the<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> p<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>roblems convince me that the time is passed for usto act. While, there, I was told by some of my constituents that whateveris done up here, ``don't authorize another study. No time is needed tostudy the problem to see if there is a problem. We already know that thereis. What we need to do is to get on with the cooperative business of solvingthe problem, which were already know how to do.'' My constituents, as theyoften are, are right again. Fortunately, the technology already existsto address the problem<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> f<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>or<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> example, wastewater treatment facilities and weneed to build more of them along the border so that the health and welfareof our citizens will be protected better.I hope that this bill will be reported from committee quickly.
