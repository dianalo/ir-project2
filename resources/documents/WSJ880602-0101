The Soviets own Israel's Supreme Court building, but an arcane rent-control law keeps revenues at a paltry level. The Russians claim ownership of a lavish palace built by a czar's cousin, but the Israeli Agriculture Ministry occupies it and pays no rent. The city of Jerusalem garners the profits from a municipal parking lot on a choice Soviet-owned parcel on bustling downtown King George Street.    &quot;This is what happens when the real owners are out of the country,&quot; gripes Giorgi Martirosov, a Soviet official dispatched by Moscow to watch over its extensive Holy Land holdings. The Russians have been out of the country since they broke diplomatic relations with Israel in 1967. Now, the Marxists are reclaiming property that Russian pilgrims originally acquired centuries ago for churches and hostels.    But real estate really isn't Mr. Martirosov's game. His pilgrimage here is intended to establish a diplomatic beachhead for the Soviets. The properties provide the perfect cover. The Israelis and Mr. Martirosov, a career diplomat with a doctorate in Mideast studies and an engaging manner, play an elaborate charade: They argue titles, rentals and property rights in order to get reacquainted.    The latest dispute involves Grand Duke Sergei Romanov's palace. The duke, on a pilgrimage in the 1860s, built the turreted yellow-brick structure to lodge upper-crust Christian peregrines. Israel's Agriculture Ministry eventually occupied most of the U-shaped building. A Russian religious order kept a seven-room apartment there, remaining even after Moscow broke diplomatic ties. Two years later, however, Israel evicted the monks as KGB spies. Locking the door and sealing the green shutters to protect their turf, the Russians left.    Now the Kremlin seeks to reclaim the palace. The Israelis say nyet. To sort of emphasize the point, officials permitted a Jerusalem family to use the duke's digs for the party after their son's bar mitzvah.    Mr. Martirosov does manage to score. Last year, the owners of the Tirat Bat Sheva hotel on King George Street asked city officials for permission to build a wing on a next-door vacant lot used for parking. The city approved. The Russians balked, claiming ownership. After much letter-writing and title-searching (the Israelis charged $30 a page to translate documents from Hebrew to Russian), Mr. Martirosov proved his case to Jerusalem officials, who canceled the project. &quot;It was a major success in our new-born relationship,&quot; says an Israeli diplomat.    Mr. Martirosov's problems could be worse. The Soviets owned Jerusalem's police headquarters building until they sold it in the 1960s. These days, Palestinian women squat forlornly in front of the place, waiting for relatives detained for West Bank rock-throwing. The Kremlin sides with the Palestinians in the dispute, so owning the building is one landlord's headache Mr. Martirosov doesn't need.    The affable Mr. Martirosov seems overqualified but admirably suited for his work. Sitting in his office in an annex of the Finnish Embassy in Tel Aviv, wearing a white crew-neck sweater and light-gray slacks, he is at home in the casual atmosphere of the Mediterranean resort city. He grants interviews to Israeli journalists and enjoys talking Mideast politics with officials.    &quot;He's very self-assured,&quot; says an Israeli who deals with Mr. Martirosov. &quot;He tells us, 'Look, I'm here while you're having rioting in the occupied territories. We could have opted to leave.'&quot;    Mr. Martirosov says Soviet-born Israelis, hungry for news of the old country, often accost him when they overhear him speaking Russian at his hotel with colleagues in his eight-member delegation. About one-third of Israel's people trace their roots to the Soviet Union, and satellite dishes that pick up Soviet television sprout from many roofs here.    &quot;They ask, 'What are you doing here?' and then talk with such nostalgia about little towns or rivers,&quot; Mr. Martirosov says.    Despite his Mideast expertise, Mr. Martirosov came here less than wholly prepared for modern Israel. He still marvels at the eye-popping sight of a teen-aged Israeli boy and girl, both in military uniform, kissing and embracing so closely that the automatic rifles on their shoulders were entwined. &quot;This was astonishing,&quot; he says.    The Soviet delegation, headed by Mr. Martirosov's predecessor, a Russian technocrat, arrived here in June 1987. The members were greeted by angry demonstrators wielding signs calling for freedom for Soviet Jews. At an awkward, 45-minute meeting, the Soviets talked about the weather; Israeli officials served orange juice. The Russians explained that they would look over their property and keep in touch. The Israelis said they weren't certain whose property it was, but they would be glad to help.    The game of cat-and-mouse commenced. Israel issues three-month visas to the Russians, who continue to request extensions, claiming their work isn't finished. To emphasize that their mission is temporary, the delegates live in hotels, and leave their families in the Soviet Union. Each week, delegation members go to Cairo, presumably to avoid electronic eavesdropping, to file their reports to Moscow.    In January the Arabic-speaking Mideast expert, Mr. Martirosov, arrived to take charge of the delegation. His credentials suggested that the Soviets might harbor more interest in diplomacy than real estate. &quot;If the Soviets decide to change the nature of the mission, they now have the right guy here,&quot; says the Israeli official.    Mr. Martirosov feigns surprise at such speculation. Unrolling a sheaf of architectural blueprints of &quot;The Russian Compound,&quot; the square-block parcel that holds the Supreme Court building, he asks, with a hint of a grin, &quot;What do you think we are doing here, playing chess?&quot;    The next move is Israel's. Jerusalem soon will dispatch its own mission -- to inspect real estate, naturally -- to Moscow. &quot;We have a long-term lease on a building in Moscow,&quot; an official says. &quot;We pay $60,000 a year in rent and did some repair work a couple of years ago. We're anxious to see the state of our building there.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
