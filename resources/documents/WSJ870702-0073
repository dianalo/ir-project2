Growing awareness of the fatal disease spawns new products ranging from a variety of AIDS tests to gold-plated condom carriers. AIMS Biotech Corp., Vancouver, develops a new type of direct test for the virus; it plans marketing through a chain of its own laboratories. Gettig Technologies Inc., Spring Mills, Pa., develops a syringe injector designed to reduce the risk of contaminating health-care workers. At least three AIDS newsletters begin publication. &quot;We've been growing at about 18% to 20% a month,&quot; says James Applebaum, editor of the seven-month-old AIDS Record.    AIDS also has become a popular marketing pitch for existing products. Insure Inc., Belleville, N.J., packages &quot;Anti-Aids&quot; condoms for sale through cigarette vending machines. Finding some of its products recommended for protection against the virus, Lab Safety Supply Inc., Janesville, Wis., puts out a special brochure on AIDS supplies.    To keep executives up to date on business opportunities, consultant Robert S. First Inc. slates an &quot;AIDS Business Update&quot; conference in New York.    EUROPEAN MARKETERS tune in to the U.S. home-shopping trend.    West German products from coffee to cars are pitched to American consumers in a weekly half-hour U.S. cable TV show broadcast in 50 states. &quot;Germany Today&quot; touts merchandise with &quot;info-mercials.&quot; A segment on a Volkswagen, for example, might feature an interview with a racer who drives one. Viewers place orders by phone. The biggest sellers so far: Hummel porcelain figurines and the traditional Christmas sweetbread Christstollen.    Companies from other European countries pick up on the trend. French department store Galeries Lafayette signs on for an &quot;electronic shopping mall&quot; experiment to sell its merchandise on cable TV in the Chicago area starting this fall. Goods will be stocked in the U.S. and priced in dollars. &quot;Europe Today,&quot; styled after the German show, also is set to go on the air this fall. Featuring products of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, the show will also include cultural and scientific segments.    ANNUAL REPORTS take on a new, slimmed-down form.    Shareholders of McKesson Corp. last week were the first to receive a summary annual report - one without full financial data. Other companies are expected to follow suit, including General Motors Corp., which was the first to win Securities and Exchange Commission permission for a change this year but didn't have time to switch for its 1986 report. &quot;A number of the Fortune 100 will be doing it this year -- possibly as many as 30%,&quot; says Roland Laing of the Financial Executives Research Foundation.    By putting required financial data into their proxies, companies say they can free their annual report from legalese and the restrictions of being a compliance document. Summary reports also save money: roughly 25%, according to McKesson, which spent $300,000 on its annual report last year. Proxy printers such as Sorg Inc., New York, say the trend means big business, but annual report designers worry they'll suffer.    Many oppose the abbreviated report, saying it will make it harder for shareholders to get needed information.    BEEP, IT'S EXPIRED: Replacing the sales-slip and registration system, an electronic warranty device displays the time elapsed since first use. Warranty Systems Inc. Wilmette, Ill., says the device, which comes in a &quot;talking&quot; version, can be put on products from cameras to typewriters.    A LITCHI NUT SHORTAGE is reported in Taiwan by visiting Lions Clubs International conventioneers. The government welcomed the 40,000 Lions and their families with 9,000 fruit baskets. The result: The prized, seasonal fruit is scarce in the markets, Lions say.    FARMLAND INCENTIVES: Farm Credit Services, St. Paul, Minn., offers a money-back guarantee, saying a buyer can return farmland on a previously agreed-upon date and get all principal payments returned. Under the offer, it expects to sell half of the 460,000 acres it currently holds due to foreclosures and forced farm sales.    NO BANNER SALES for the Stars and Stripes this year.    Current troubles in the White House are damping flag sales for some. &quot;I see some softening in flag sales as Reagan's popularity declines and patriotic enthusiasm wanes,&quot; says William Spangler of Dettra Flag Co., Oaks, Pa. The 200th birthday of the Constitution hasn't helped sales &quot;as much as we'd hoped,&quot; says William Sweigart of Bux-Mont Flag Poles, Horsesham, Pa. The Flag Store in Dallas pegs its 25% sales decline to oil-patch economic woes.    U.S. flags remain the mainstay of the flag business, with corporations, states and local governments the major buyers. The latest trend in flag buying: Some businesses, particularly car dealers, are erecting 50-foot poles and flying oversized flags as a form of advertising. The message: &quot;Buy America,&quot; says Kerry Thompson of Arkansas Flag and Banner in Little Rock.    Homeowners are a less important market, with only one out of eight homes flying flags, says Jack Casey of Betsy Ross Flag Girls, Albuquerque, N.M.    BRIEFS: The song most sung at Center Stage, a chain of storefront record-your-own-voice studios: Whitney Houston's &quot;Greatest Love of All.&quot; . . . Van Gogh, in the Dallas area, bills itself as a record store &quot;for those with an ear for music.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
