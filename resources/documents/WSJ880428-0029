The National Foreign Trade Council Inc., in a letter to U.S. corporations, warns that the new sanctions bill could move swiftly through Congress. The bill, which is expected to be approved by the House Foreign Affairs committee today, would require U.S. companies to terminate nearly all investments in South Africa and end all trade within a year.    &quot;Given the politics of this issue in an American presidential election year, the companies in the coalition felt it was necessary to make an extraordinary effort to oppose new sanctions,&quot; the council states in a copy of the letter made available to this newspaper.    Daniel O'Flaherty, the council's vice president, said the companies have formed a coalition to advocate &quot;continuing their presence in South Africa, which they are convinced is undermining the system of apartheid.&quot;    Union Carbide Corp. and Chevron Corp.'s Chevron USA Inc. unit have each donated $5,000 to the effort, spokesmen for those companies said. Industry sources said about 20 companies are involved in the campaign. The council consists of about 500 companies and associations involved in international trade.    According to sources familiar with the lobbying campaign, companies actively involved in it include: Mobil Corp., Texaco Inc., Dresser Industries Inc., Johnson andamp; Johnson, CBI Industries Inc., Combustion Engineering Inc. and Caterpillar Inc. A Dresser Industries official refused to comment on the company's role in the campaign. Officials of the other companies either couldn't be reached or didn't return phone calls for comment.    The business group hired the law firm of former Indiana Sen. Birch Bayh, one of the Senate's leading liberal lights in the 1970s, to press its case on Capitol Hill. A source familiar with the lobbying campaign said Mr. Bayh's firm would be paid $25,000 a month for a six-month period, beginning this month, plus as much as $75,000 for additional expenses.    Mr. Bayh, in an interview, said that the campaign would be aimed at showing Congress that most U.S. companies doing business in South Africa don't support the minority-white regime's policy of apartheid, or racial separatism.    &quot;Many are on the cutting edge of reform,&quot; integrating their work forces, offering equal pay for equal work, dealing with labor unions and &quot;standing up to the regime,&quot; he said. When Congress &quot;turns the screws&quot; tighter on the regime, he said, &quot;you want to make sure you don't have the feet of the people you're trying to help in the press.&quot;    Advocates for new sanctions argue that only increased pressure will bring about the dismantling of the apartheid system.    The letter from the National Foreign Trade Council to corporations said the &quot;best opportunity to defeat it (the bill) is in the Senate.&quot; In 1986, when Congress passed legislation containing sanctions over President Reagan's veto, the House approved a severe measure that later was modified by the Senate. However, the Senate at that time was controlled by Republicans.    A Senate aide said an effort is already under way to find &quot;consensus legislation&quot; that would increase the pressure on Pretoria without being &quot;so overarching and punitive.&quot; The aide said these measures might include tightening some technical loopholes in the current sanctions and more stringent monitoring of trade between the U.S. and South Africa.    Current economic sanctions bar new U.S. business investment and loans in South Africa, prohibit the importation of South African steel, uranium and agricultural products and suspend U.S. landing rights for South Africa Airways.    In addition to requiring total disinvestment, the House bill includes provisions that would prohibit foreign oil companies doing business in South Africa from bidding on U.S. oil, gas or coal leases and bar any U.S. military or intelligence cooperation with Pretoria.    The full House is expected to vote on a sanctions bill next month, according to committee staff members. The Senate, which is waiting for the House to act first, is expected to hold committee hearings in May and perhaps act on a bill in June. &quot;It all depends on the momentum it has when it comes over here from the House,&quot; said one Senate staff member. </TEXT></DOC>
