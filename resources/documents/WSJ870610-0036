The lawsuit is one of several filed in recent years in which natural-gas transmission companies have alleged fraud by employees. In addition, a federal grand jury here has been investigating what authorities call &quot;widespread corruption and corporate bribery in the natural-gas industry.&quot; The grand jury already has handed up at least one indictment in an apparently unrelated case.    The civil lawsuit filed by MidCon Ventures Inc., a unit of Los Angeles-based Occidental, claims that Edwin A. Allen of Montgomery County, Texas, formerly president of MidCon Ventures, participated in a conspiracy to deprive MidCon of profits by receiving kickbacks on sales of natural gas arranged at less than market value. Also named as defendants were Lee I. Meador of Colorado, the father-in-law of Mr. Allen's daughter, and Continental Natural Gas, identified in the suit only as an Oklahoma concern. Neither Mr. Allen nor Mr. Meador could be reached for comment.    The lawsuit claims that Mr. Meador, the father-in-law, &quot;was in no way connected either with MidCon or Continental,&quot; but that he nevertheless received &quot;a kickback and/or illegal payment every time MidCon sold natural gas to Continental.&quot; The payments, which were made by Continental, &quot;represented a percentage of the proceeds of gas that MidCon sold to Continental,&quot; the suit claims.    A lawyer for MidCon declined to provide any additional details, including to further identify the defendants or to provide their cities of residence. </TEXT></DOC>
