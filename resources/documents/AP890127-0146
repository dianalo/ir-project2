In an expose headlined ``Diagnosis: Syringe,'' the labor dailyTrud said ``criminal negligence'' was suspected at the republicanchildren's hospital in Elista, in southern Russia.   Authorities discovered the outbreak in November when a child anda woman blood donor from the hospital were found to have AIDS.   The Soviet Union only recently has admitted to an AIDS problemand started diagnosis, treatment and prevention programs.   Authorities discovered that a son of the woman blood donor haddied after treatment in the same hospital as the AIDS-infectedchild, and began testing other children and mothers there, Trudsaid. Of 300 people screened, 27 children _ most under 2 _ and fourmothers were found to have AIDS.   The women apparently contracted the virus from their children,through breastfeeding, Trud said. It said the mothers' nipples musthave cracked and the infants passed the virus on to them. Such amethod of transmission has not been identified previously, accordingto the newspaper.   Anne Sims, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Centers for Disease Controlin Atlanta, said AIDS specialists there consider it highly unlikelythat infants could give AIDS to their mothers through breastfeeding.The CDC knows of only one case of an infant giving AIDS to itsmother, Sims said, but that transmission occurred through blood.   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus thatdamages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible toinfections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexualcontact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected bloodor blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.   More tests are planned on 1,000 children at the hospital, as wellas on patients at other facilities where the children also had beentreated, Trud said.   Vadim V. Pokrovsky, head of the AIDS laboratory of the CentralScientific Research Institute of Epidemiology in Moscow, said thenumber of AIDS cases traced to the Elista hospital could double ortriple as tests continue.   ``If measures aren't taken to control infection by instruments,the disease could spread,'' Pokrovsky said on the TV news program``Vremya.''   The infected patients were carrying the disease but had not shownsymptoms and none had died, he said.   ``An unprecedented situation has been created in the republic inwhich during two months more than 30 carriers of the virus have beenrevealed,'' Pokrovsky said.   He told Trud an investigation will determine who was responsible.   The Council of Ministers warned in 1987 that infecting someonewith AIDS would be punished as a crime and said anyone in thecountry could be forced to take an AIDS test. Under a new regulationthat take effect next month, foreigners who want to stay more thanthree months will have to prove they are AIDS-free.   The newspaper said hospital staff had violated all sanitaryrules. Log books that were supposed to contain records of paymentsfor syringes were either missing or blank. Some 14 percent ofinstruments used last year were not sterilized as required, Trudreported.   Disposable syringes are in short supply in the Soviet Union.Glass syringes are used most frequently after sterilization inboiling water. Trud said the two agencies responsible for producingsyringes had made only excuses for the shortage and admitted theywere turning to foreign companies for supplies.   Trud said the incident eroded confidence in the Soviet medicalsystem.   ``Probably no doctor is better than a bad doctor,'' the newspapersaid.   It also lashed out at the Soviet Union for not taking more activemeasures against AIDS.   ``We are still not prepared for a serious battle against it,''Trud said.   Instead of combatting the virus, Soviet doctors engage in an``ideological battle'' to blame the spread of AIDS on the West, itsaid. It quoted one official as writing that ``the roots ofdistribution are the American and Western ways of life,irrepressible and prospering homosexuality.''   Last year, the first Soviet AIDS deaths were reported: a4-month-old baby from Odessa apparently infected by its mother, anda 29-year-old Leningrad prostitute. Tests identified 112 Soviets and334 foreign residents carrying the human immunodeficiency virus. Ofthem, five foreigners and three Soviets have contracted the disease.</TEXT></DOC>
