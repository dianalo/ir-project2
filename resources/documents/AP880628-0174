DavidDurenberger, R-Minn.   The bill would not change the duties or offices of thegovernment's largest regulatory agency, but would upgrade it to the``Department of Environmental Protection'' headed by a secretary.   The senators conceded that they had little hope of quickpassage, but said the bill was intended to prod presidentialcandidates into dealing with environmental issues.   ``I very much want George Bush and Michael Dukakis to addressenvironmental issues in their campaigns. Putting this issue beforethem will very much encourage that debate,'' said Sen. John Heinz,R-Pa., another sponsor.   Heinz declined to criticize President Reagan's environmentalrecord, something Dukakis, the likely Democratic presidentialnominee, has done on occasion and many environmental groups dofrequently.   ``Given where the United States was in 1980 and 1981 and(Reagan's) experience, I think the president would agree concernover the environment has sharply increased in the past six or eightyears. That's true for him and it's true for us,'' Heinz said.   But Durenberger said, ``We want the next president of the UnitedStates directly involved in making environmental policy,''something Reagan has not generally been involved in.   The agency needs the clout that Cabinet status can bring, bothagainst other departments of the government, in internationalnegotiations, in seeking larger budgets and in pressing its viewson Congress, the senators said.   Though EPA led the development of the administration's positionto seek large worldwide cuts in emissions of chemicals that destroythe earth's protective ozone layer and won a treaty last yearcalling for a 50 percent reduction by 1998, ``it was more difficultfrom the position of an agency than it would have been at theCabinet level,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.   In addition to Chafee, Heinz and Durenberger, the other initialsponsors included Sen. Lowell Weicker, R-Conn. and Sen. RobertStafford, R-Vt. All but Stafford are seeking re-election inNovember.   EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas, in a comment relayed byspokesman David Cohen, said he had no complaints about his agency'sclout in the current administration but added: ``The role of thisagency has grown significantly and we should sit at the same tablewith the rest of the major players. This proposal strikes me as anexcellent idea.''   EPA has about 14,000 employees and spends $3.1 billion a year,roughly half of that on the ``Superfund'' toxic waste cleanupprogram. It distributes more than $2 billion a year more in grantsfor sewage plants.   The agency administers 13 major laws and through them is thechief overseer of massive pollution control and abatement spendingby states, cities, businesses and consumers that by some estimatestotals as much as $70 billion per year.   EPA was formed by President Nixon's executive order in 1970 outof pieces of the Agriculture, Interior and Health, Education andWelfare departments and the Atomic Energy Commission.</TEXT></DOC>
