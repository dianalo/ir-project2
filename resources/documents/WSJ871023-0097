These doubts are clearly being reflected in stock prices. Before the stock market plunged, speculators routinely snapped up the stock of companies involved in announced takeovers, bidding many targets' share prices well above the proposal prices. But since the crash, prices of stocks in announced takeovers have dipped far below offering prices, even where definitive agreements have been signed.    In September, Owens-Illinois Inc. definitively agreed to acquire Brockway Inc. for $60 a share, or $750 million. But in New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Brockway shares closed at $42.75, or 29% below the offering price.    &quot;There is a high degree of uncertainty about whether deals will hold,&quot; said Joseph R. Perella, co-head of investment banking at First Boston Corp. Indeed, Mr. Perella notes, several announced takeovers have been scrapped since the market began to tumble.    Carl C. Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., earlier this week withdrew a proposal to take the carrier private. The New York-based airline's board had accepted the plan only last Friday. And last Monday, Samuel J. Heyman, chairman and chief executive officer of Wayne, N.J.-based GAF Corp., said he was reconsidering his $2.3 billion proposal to acquire the company. Messrs. Icahn and Heyman said they were scrapping their bids, at least for the moment, because of the changed market conditions.    Investors also worry that in announced takeovers, buyers now will be tempted to lower their prices. With stock prices so depressed, buyers may be able to make a lower offers and have them accepted by shareholders. &quot;Nobody knows where interest rates are going or where stocks will trade&quot; in coming weeks, said Stephen Waters, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. &quot;People react to uncertainty by sharply discounting&quot; stocks, he said.    Other factors also are contributing to the sharp discount of takeover stocks, which have plunged even further than other issues. Arbitragers, forced by margin calls to liquidate substantial portions of their holdings, have been dumping takeover stocks, often taking whatever they can get for their shares.    Moreover, arbitragers who in the past could be counted on to hold huge chunks of stocks that were regarded as takeover targets now are staying away because they have incurred substantial losses in recent days. &quot;Arbs don't have the buying power or appetite they had before,&quot; said one Wall Street trader.    Even for those deals that traders say are likely to be completed, the differences between the proposed acquisition prices and the stocks' current market prices are unusually large. Hongkong andamp; Shanghai Banking Corp. earlier this month agreed to buy the 48% interest in Marine Midland Banks Inc. that it doesn't already own for $83 a share, plus a 51-cent-a-share special cash dividend. Yesterday, Marine Midland fell $2 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading to $76.25 a share.    Arbitragers &quot;are selling their quality stocks, like Marine Midland, to preserve capital,&quot; one trader explained. The trader added, &quot;The spreads are widening in the good deals on a daily basis.&quot;    Few traders doubt that General Electric Credit Corp., a General Electric Co. unit, will complete its proposed purchase of Gelco Corp. for $35 a share, or $250 million. &quot;Two weeks ago, you would have seen spreads of maybe $1.25, at most,&quot; one trader said. Yesterday, Gelco closed at $30.75 a share, down 75 cents, in Big Board trading.    Proposed acquisitions subject to greater uncertainties are trading at even larger discounts. Closely held Thompson Co. has completed a $77-a-share tender offer for two-thirds of Southland Corp.'s common shares. It has agreed to buy each of the remaining shares for $61.32 cash and 0.6672 of a new $25 exchangeable junior preferred share. Yesterday on the Big Board, Southland fell $3.25 to close at $46.75 a share.    Traders said they were trying to sell Southland because of concern that the company won't be able to complete a financing with high-risk high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bonds necessary to finish the buy-out. Traditional purchasers of junk bonds are balking at buying them because of uncertainty about where interest rates are headed.    Speculators also are retreating from stocks of companies that have been targets of recently announced hostile raids, even though bidders have said publicly they don't intend to back off. Yesterday, for example, Telex Corp. shares closed at $47.125, far below the $65-a-share tender offer for the company by Asher B. Edelman, the New York investor.    Yesterday, Mr. Edelman said he took another step toward arranging bank financing for the bid; Telex has declined to recommend that holders accept the proposal. &quot;I have no present intention of lowering my bid,&quot; Mr. Edelman said. He added that Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., his investment banker, still is willing to finance the purchase of Telex.    &quot;All deals that aren't finished are subject to breaking up,&quot; said a trader at a large investment banking firm. &quot;I don't know what a good deal means anymore. A deal that's alive today could die tomorrow, and we'd be left holding the stock because you can't sell (most takeover stocks). Nobody will buy your stock.&quot;    ---                    Proposed Takeovers                                        PRICE      TODAY'S    TRANSACTION                     PER-SHARE      CLOSING (DATE ANNOUNCED)                    OF OFFER       PRICE* Definitive agreement to acquire       $95.00       $70.00   Holly Sugar by Plum Associates   (10/20/87) Definitive agreement to acquire       $68.00       $66.50   U.S. Leasing International by   Ford Motor (10/12/87) Definitive agreement to acquire       $35.00       $30.75   Gelco by GE Credit (10/2/87) Definitive agreement to acquire       $60.00       $42.75   Brockway by Owens-Illinois   (9/18/87) Definitive agreement to acquire       $83.51**     $76.25   48% interest in Marine Midland   Banks by HongKong andamp; Shanghai   Banking (9/16/87) Definitive agreement to acquire       $33.65       $22.63   Parisian by P.I.
