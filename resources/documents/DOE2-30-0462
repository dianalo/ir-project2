Ingeneral, the commercial potential for cogeneration has not improved.If the preferred fuel is natural gas, the commercial potential amountsto 220 MW, with average payback periods of 25 and 17 y with 0 and 2%real escalation in electricity prices (compared to 13 year payback in1979). Using wood waste as a fuel in the forest industries, potentialcapacity improves to 970 MW, with payback periods of 18 and 13 y with0 and 2% electricity price escalation. The fraction of commercially feasibleprojects was also not significantly changed from the 19% figure of 1979.The best penetration of commercially viable projects is in the Maritimeprovinces due to higher electricity prices, but these represent only8% of the Canadian total. The greatest commercial potential is in theforest industries, followed by refineries and the iron/steel industries.In all industries the potential has declined from the 1979 study. Onthe other hand, the use of energy resource costs (shadow prices) revealsthat almost all cogeneration projects identified in this Canada-widesurvey are economically viable from a national perspective. If naturalgas is the preferred fuel, the economic potential represents a capacityof about 2300 MW (ca 10 times the commercial potential). If waste fuelsare used in the forest industries, the scope for economically viableelectricity production is more than twice the quantity shown to be commerciallyfeasible. 10 refs., 2 figs., 17 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
