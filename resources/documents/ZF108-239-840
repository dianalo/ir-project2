 I'd like to know what otheradministrators of large sites do about controlling the contents of newspostings and signatures.andP;  Recently, we stopped feeding a newsgroup because acouple of people got very political and bad-tempered, and it was felt thatthey were reflecting badly on the company as a whole.andP;  While I am all forfreedom of speech, management felt (and I agreed) that this does notnecessarily apply to Usenet postings, which the company pays to provide.andM;Some people seem to believe that they have a &quot;right&quot; to be political andbad-tempered--whether it reflects badly on their own organizations ornot--with complete impunity.andP;  However, when and how administrators confrontthis issue may be more relevant than the specifics of what decisions mayresult.andP;  It probably matters least whether those decisions conform to theacions of administrators in other organizations.andM;The real problem is that, usually, not formal, coherent policy is establishedin advance of the need.andP;  For the most part, management isn't directlyinvolved in defining such policy until a crisis arises.andP;  Without it, usersget conflicting ideas about what is and isn't okay to send over Usenet.andM;Formal PoliciesandM;In every giant flame war I've witnessed on Usenet concerning how a particularsite has threatened Western civilization by barring some user (or somedistributed group), the disputed event is characterized by the fact thatmanagement made its decision on how to respond based on an after-the-factpolicy definition.andP;  In the final analysis, this indicates a managementfailure.andM;Why?andP;  It's simple: the local management is responsible for deciding howinstitutional resources (including computing services) are to serve theoverall mission of the institution, and is thus obliged to ensure that thosedecisions are not undermined by misuse or abuse.andP;  This is its job, whether itdoes it or not.andM;Each organization, having a unique mission, must avoid the naive logic thatUsenet has rules to which they must adhere because other organizations (withdifferent missions) have adopted them.andP;  In actual practice, decisions aboutwhat groups to carry and which users have what privileges are made byadministrators all the time on a case-by-case basis.andP;  That these decisionsvary widely should come as no surprise to anyone not raised in a cave.andP;  Whatsome yahoo in another organization calls &quot;the spirit of Usenet&quot; is, perhaps,ardently poetic, but such statements have nothing to do with real-worldpolicy criteria.andM;Managers rarely own the computing resources they oversee.andP;  However, they dohave some real obligations of stewardship toward the true resource owners.andO;This is true in any organization, be it within the sanctity of the universityor in the world of commerce.andM;Usually, though, responsibility for anticipating potentially hazardous eventsand forestalling them using rational policy is not met, either by theadministrators that might identify them or by the management that mightgenerate the policy.andP;  Until.andP;  .  .  .andM;Until management finds itself confronted with a nasty situation that demandsan immediate response.andP;  At this point, a &quot;policy&quot; must suddenly be defined inan ad hoc manner, driven by an event about which people now please themselvesto choose up sides and fight.andP;  This is potentially damaging and grandlyinelegant.andM;Such situations are generally thrust upon management, which truly wishes thewhole thing would just go away.andP;  The cost of playing catch-up is alwaysenormous, relative to the cost associated with handling the issue before itarises.andM;How do we solve this problem?andP;  Define policies that lay out the rules inwriting, in advance, and explain to users the reasoning behind them.andM;It is not necessary that all users agree with the reasoning--only that theyunderstand it.andP;  If they also agree with it, that's nice.andP;  If they don't,listen very carefully to their concerns.andP;  Usually you will find that you havenot conveyed your meaning clearly.andM;A written policy should succinctly define desired outcomes to be obtained orundesired outcomes to be avoided, along with information suggesting how andwhy these outcomes should be treated as proposed.andM;You want to ensure that, in the event that someone &quot;crosses the line&quot; andviolates an organization's policy, the following points are already in place:andM;* The &quot;line&quot; was defined before and not after the event in question tookplace.andM;* The &quot;line&quot; wasn't arbitrary or created and enforced on your sole authority.andO;This could create many problems for you as an administrator.andM;* All the users have read the policy, have had the opportunity to askquestions, and clearly understand that by logging in, they have agreed to thepolicy.andM;* The wording of your policy is simple and to the point.andP;  Remember that it isthe understanding of the policy's intent that is most important.andM;* The final approval of policies came from the highest possible level of theorganization.andM;Again, if you are the administrator, be certain that you have at least theimplicit approval of management (and it is better to have explicit approval)before establishing policies formally and publicly.andP;  In any case, be sure youget some kind of approval, or the policy will likely wither when a crisisarises in which it might apply.andM;If you develop and present to your management a general outline of yourproposed policy, along with good arguments in favor of it, there is a goodchance that you will eventually get most or all of what you want.andP;  Be surethat management is comfortable with the policy's basic philosophy beforecommitting to specific policy descriptions.andM;The person who formulates the definition of the issues to be addressed isoften in the strongest position to govern the final outcome.andP;  If you are thesystem administrator, be sure that you are this person.andP;  Note that if youwait for an &quot;event&quot; to occur before defining policy, there is a very goodchance that the policy created ad hoc by an angry and harried management willbe far more draconian than warranted, and you will then be compelled toenforce it.andP;  You will most likely get what you don't want if you let thishappen.andM;Document the details of the policy after you and management are inagreement--in principle--about what is needed and why.andP;  There should be nosurprises for anyone on fundamentals.andM;Once this point is reached, submit the final document for signed approval.andO;The success of this step should be a shop-in, if you've performed the othersteps in order.andM;If your organization genuinely cares about what its people think and feel,then get permission to set up a panel of users to review the proposed policy.andO;This makes compliance a non-issue.andM;Publicizing the PolicyandM;The implementation of a policy is simple:andM;* set up a means to present the policy to users on-line (such as a shellscript offering a menu of policies)andM;* advertise how to access the stored policies and inform the users (inwriting) that they are responsible for understanding and complying withpublished policies,andM;* tell users that they should direct any questions to you, the systemadministrator.andM;If a policy changes, put a notice in /etc/motd that briefly summarizes thechange, and e-mail a copy of this notice to every user, especially managers.andO;If managers don't use the computer, send them a hard copy.andP;  [Editor's Note:Bud will e-mail you the shell script mentioned above if you write to him at{tektronixsun}!nosun!whizz!bbh.]  Use RCS or SCCS to document and date-stampany changes to policy files.andP;  This is easy and protects you againstsubsequent hassles over when changes were actually implemented.andP;  Again, keepit simple.andP;  Once original basic policy is hammered out, policy-making andenforcement should be a very low-overhead operation.andP;  Well-defined policiesdo not suffer from constant change.andP;  If yours do, get some outside help fromsomeone skilled in formulating them.andP;  If possible, find someone who knowsnothing about computing.andP;  It may take a bit longer, but the resultingpolicies will probably be better defined.andP;  (When my father was writing hismasterhs thesis, he used me as his proofreader.andP;  I was ten.andP;  He figured thatif I had a problem understanding something he had written, it probably wasn'tclear and he changed it.)andM;Rather than writing one huge policy &quot;mega-document&quot;, you can set up topicaltext files in a designated on-line policy directory that can be maintainedeasily and called by the menu suggested above.andP;  For example, our currentpolicy directory contains:andM;size  nameandM;922  /usr/local/adm/Policy/back 846  /usr/local/adm/Policy/gen 1455 /usr/local/adm/Policy/logins 5123  /usr/local/adm/Policy/org 317 /usr/local/adm/Policy/usenetandM;Note that most of these files are tiny.andP;  The biggest one is a complete layoutof the entire directory structure, with descriptions of what each directorycontains.andP;  This is nice for new users, who may be a bit mystified by it all,and for anyone else who wants to know how the system is organized.andM;It took me about two hours to document local policies (I am the systemadministrator as well as a manager/owner, so this part was lightning-fast).andO;The shell script took about 45 minutes.andP;  Total investment: under three hours.andO;Now my users can be informed of how the system is and isn't to be used byselecting items from the policy menu.andP;  To wit:andM;DIRECTORY OF LOCAL POLICY FOR HOST 'WHIZZ' back--who makes backups and whengen--general overview logins--responsibilities of users org--where we putthings (and why) usenet--requests for connection or 'q'uitandM;To review a policy, type in subject: andgt;andM;The menu expands, contracts, or changes each time I add, delete, or alter apolicy text filename or description.andP;  It's dirt simple.andM;As for enforcement, in larger organizations, peer review by fellow users maybe much more effective than making senior managers (or yourself) the soleprosecutor.andP;  Fellow users may be even harsher in their judgment of allegedoffenders than management would be.andM;SummaryandM;Again, you will probably find that enforcement is a non-issue if yourpolicies are:andM;* Simple--your 10-year-old kid understands it;andM;* Written--uses journalistic style and phrasing;andM;* Advertised--everyone knows where and what they are;andM;* Consistent--creates no obvious logical conflicts;andM;* Functional--makes sense in support of the organization's mission;andM;* Human--avoids a bureaucratic tone (humor helps);andM;* Authorized--management signs off on it (preferably &quot;top&quot; management).andM;Kolstad's CorrigendumandM;Reader Grif Rosser (grif@Canada.Sun.COM) kindly wrote to me about importantmisleading statements in &quot;Daemons and Dragons&quot; Vol.andP;  7 No.andP;  12 regardingsingle-user mode.andP;  He wrote (by way of offering a personal comment, not as arepresentative of Sun Microsystems):andM;In your column abot Regression Testing in the December issue of UNIX REVIEWyou discussed software upgrades.andP;  You said &quot;.andP;  .  .you often findandM;yourself working in single-user mode.andP;  .  .  .   This meansandM;that [only] the files in bin are available (/sbin on many Sun systems).andP;  . andO;.&quot;.  You went on to discuss what should be made available for a single-usersession.andP;  For most UNIX implementations this is what would be required, or atworst, harmless; for SunOS, this is, unfortunately, very misleading.andM;/sbin is a directory that contains the bare minimum of files required to bootSunOS.andP;  It includes init, mount, ifconfig, hostname and sh.andP;  Implying to yourreaders that they should install cat, fsck, Is, mknod, mv, restore, and tarin /sbin on their Suns could be very nasty.andP;  Some of the programs yousuggested are dynamically linked executables in SunOS.andM;(Which is to say, they must be re-linked with -Bstatic in order to executeproperly without shared libraries.andP;  This could be a difficult task withoutthe sources.)andM;Editorhs Note: This mont's column is written by guest author Bud Hovell, aproductivity- and project-management specialist with McCormick andamp; Hovell Inc.andO;He penned it in response to a question that appeared on thesystem-administration mailing list sponsored by Bjorn Satdeva,bjorn@sysadmin.com.andM;Rob Kolstad has been a system administrator for seven years.andP;  After leavingthe University of Illinois in 1982, he headed for start-up Convex ComputerCorp. in Dallas.andP;  He is now a software manager for Sun Microsystems at itsRocky Mountain Technology Center in Colorado Springs.andP;  Please send topics andquestions to kolstad@prisma.com or uunet!prisma!kolstad.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
