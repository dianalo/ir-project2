The lowest detectable exposure dose was about 10 {mu}R for gamma-rays.It has been confirmed that BeO can be used as a practical and sensitivedosimeter of X and gamma-rays. For beta-rays, it was observed that thenumber of the emitted exoelectron is not correlated with the absorbedenergy in the material, but that it has a correlation with the stoppingpower of material for incident beta-rays. In the measurement of alpha-rays,the results obtained are almost similar to the case of beta-rays witha little different type. Therefor, TSEE specimen can be used as a thinfilm dosimeter. The fact that at the measurement of beta and alpha-raysthe TSEE corresponds only to the energy deposited with a thin surfacelayer of about 100nm thickness is a general and important problem ofsolid state detector.</TEXT></DOC>
