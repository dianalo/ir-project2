State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley on Tuesday said thatif U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar succeeds in usingdiplomacy to achieve the cease-fire, ``there wouldn't be need for asecond, follow-up resolution'' calling for the arms embargo.   The Soviet Union joined with the United States in approving aresolution last July for a cease-fire, but refused to put forcebehind it with an arms embargo. Instead, the Soviets said theyfavored more diplomacy, particularly through Perez de Cuellar'soffice in New York.   Mrs. Oakley declined to credit Moscow with choosing the moreeffective course, saying U.S. pressure had contributed to Iran'sdecision to finally accept the cease-fire order.   ``I think you have to look at the first steps that are beingtaken as a testament to the success of a firm and consistentpolicy,'' she said.   The State Department official said its other accomplishmentsincluded protecting freedom of navigation and preventing the spreadof Soviet influence in the gulf region.   However, the Center for Defense Information, a private researchgroup, said that while attacks on merchant shipping had declined abit since December, the toll since Reagan ordered the U.S. Navy toprotect neutral shipping last July had increased.   Since July 22 of last year, when 11 Kuwaiti tankers werere-flagged with the Stars and Stripes, 188 merchant ships have beenattacked, 106 by Iran and 82 by Iraq. A total of 320 merchantseamen were killed.   A year earlier, there were 117 attacks, 54 by Iran and 63 byIraq, the center's Brian McCarten said.   While Perez de Cuellar moved to try to implement the cease-fire,Iran on Tuesday claimed Iraqi forces had attacked a nuclear plantand other Iranian targets. Iranian warplanes retaliated by raidinga dam in Iraq.   The Reagan administration, meanwhile, hesitated to reduce thepotent flotilla of 18 U.S. warships that keep an eye on the 7.7million barrels a day of oil that pass through the Strait of Hormuz.   Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said it was too early to``speculate`` when a cease-fire in the eight-year war might permita reduction of U.S. warships.   When all provisions of the United Nations cease-fire resolutionare implemented, Howard said, ``the United States and its allieswould no doubt reassess their expanded naval presence in the gulf.''   ``But it is early days yet, and premature to speculate on when,where, how, or any kind of timetable. We will have to wait and see.   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, House Armed Services CommitteeChairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said Iran's embrace of the cease-fireplan should be treated cautiously.   ``Our reaction should not be ecstasy that peace is at hand nordismissal that the Iranians are lying,'' Aspin said in a preparedstatement.   He said there are two possible reasons for the announcement: ``agenuine change'' by Iran or ``a mere ploy to buy time to betterprepare militarily.''</TEXT></DOC>
