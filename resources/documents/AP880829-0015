There was no singlehost this year.   Executive producer Lorne Michaels, the creator of ``SaturdayNight Live,'' was brought in by the academy in hopes of enliveningthe Emmy show, which most critics considered a four-hour yawn lastyear.   ``This show won't take itself too seriously,'' Michaels said.   To that end, it featured a ``designated acceptor'' for absentwinners _ actor Tony Danza. He was kept busy throughout the nightas others winners were not present, and after a half-dozen walks tothe stage, he cracked: ``Now I'm mad; where are these people?''   To add to the merriment, Michaels enlisted ``Saturday Night's''Nora Dunn and Jan Hooks as the ``Sweeney Sisters.'' They gavemockish versions of television theme songs and trooped the stellaraudience squealing at the celebrities.</TEXT><TEXT>   Last year the Emmy telecast received its lowest rating onrecord. That was the first time the Emmys had not been presented onABC, CBS or NBC. Fox outbid the big three networks and entered intoa three-year contract.   For the first time this year, programs broadcast on cable wereeligible, as long as they were available to 50 percent of thenation's population. Five cable networks managed to collect 21nominations among them, compared to 114 for NBC, 87 for CBS, 75 forABC, and 27 for PBS.   The Emmy telecast, which normally is scheduled for lateSeptember, was earlier this year to avoid competing with theOlympic Games, said academy spokesman Murray Weissman.</TEXT></DOC>
