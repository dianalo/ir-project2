Most of the protesters were investors who haven't been able to find buyers for their stocks since the government's announcement Sept. 24.    The demonstrators, who called for the resignation of Finance Minister Shirley Kuo, blocked sidewalks and streets, causing a three-hour traffic jam.    They dispersed when hundreds of riot police moved in and threatened to end the illegal demonstration. In Taiwan, demonstrators must receive permission for street protests.    The government says it has no plans to reverse its decision and will levy the tax again next year after a 12-year hiatus. The Finance Ministry said the tax was needed to cool an overheated market.    In the selling wave that has rolled over the market since then, the Taiwan market's weighted price index has fallen nearly 22%, to 6899.91 yesterday from a peak of 8789.78 Sept. 24, despite government regulations that limit the amount the index can fall in each session. </TEXT></DOC>
