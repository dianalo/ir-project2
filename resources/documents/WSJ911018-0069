In 1986, ETEK underbid Picker International Inc. by 35%and won a $94,000-a-year contract to service and maintain thePicker-made CT scanner at the Veterans AdministrationHospital in Houston.</LP><TEXT>   Wresting business from Picker, which at that time had CT(computed-tomography) imaging machines in nearly 93% of thenation's VA medical centers, was a coup for ETEK. But it soonturned sour.   As ETEK began winning other contracts, Picker retaliated.It removed some software and other materials used totrouble-shoot and maintain its machines, which it contendsare proprietary. In 1989, a federal court in Nashville,Tenn., ruled that Picker had a right to remove its manualsfrom companies that no longer were service customers.   Picker also refused to sell replacement parts to ETEK. Andit launched a &quot;smear&quot; campaign to discredit its competitor,the tiny firm alleges. Picker denies doing so, but soon mostof ETEK's hospital customers, including the Houston VA,switched back to the big manufacturer.   The story of how Picker and other medical-equipmentmakers, including General Electric Co., Philips ElectronicsN.V. of the Netherlands, Germany's Siemens AG and Japan'sToshiba Corp., zealously protect their lucrative high-techservice businesses partly explains why the nation'shealth-care bill keeps rising. Health-care facilities saythey could slash more than a billion dollars from theirannual service bills if manufacturers let them hire thirdparties such as ETEK. Of 500 large U.S. health institutionssurveyed last year by U.S. Counseling Services, a consultingfirm in Brookfield, Wis., 88% said theirequipment-maintenance costs were too high, with manufacturerscharging 40% to 50% more than what third parties would.   More broadly at issue are restrictive sales and servicecontracts, valued at more than $50 billion annually, forequipment ranging from computers and fax machines totelecommunications equipment. The U.S. Supreme Court isscheduled to consider whether Eastman Kodak Co.'s policy ofpreventing third parties from servicing its copiers, printersand other equipment by refusing to sell parts to themviolates antitrust law.   Manufacturers have reason to play rough with servicecompetitors. The manufacturers say profits on their $3.2billion U.S. sales of high-tech medical diagnostic imagingequipment are slight, squeezed by intense competition. Togenerate profits, they tie sales of the machines, which cost$1 million to $2 million apiece, to long-term servicecontracts, which range from $125,000 to $200,000 annually.   The manufacturers also contend that their diagnosticsoftware, which is used to spot trouble in and repairmachines, costs a lot to develop. Few third parties canafford to write such software.   GE has sued rival service companies to prevent them fromusing its software and service manuals. After R Squared ScanSystems of Pomona, Calif., the largest independent serviceorganization, bought two of GE's CT scanners, GE refused togrant it even the basic license to operate the machines. Onlyafter a long legal battle did GE recently relent. In return,R Squared agreed not to use GE's advanced diagnostic softwarein servicing GE's CT and magnetic resonance imaging machines.   Philips and Siemens also refuse to license their servicesoftware to third parties. When Phoenix Medical ElectronicsInc. of Chantilly, Va., recently took over a Siemens CTcontract at Montgomery General Hospital in Blacksburg, Va.,for example, Siemens demanded that the hospital return thediagnostic software. The hospital refused. But when Phoenixlater needed a replacement motor gear head, Siemens's servicecenter quoted a price of $6,125. Phoenix tracked down aFlorida supplier and bought the part for $285.   In the litigation between R Squared and GE, a federalcourt in North Carolina noted in its opinion &quot;some evidence&quot;presented by R Squared that GE &quot;put a price squeeze onindependent service organizations by charging unreasonableprices.&quot; GE responds that &quot;no legal conclusion&quot; was reachedon this issue. GE adds that it charges &quot;the same prices forparts to all its customers&quot; and that R Squared sought &quot;lowerpricing than the rest.&quot;   Picker International, a unit of Britain's General ElectricCo. PLC (which isn't related to GE of the U.S.), &quot;is the mostaggressive&quot; of the medical-equipment makers, says Duane H.Bluemke, president of U.S. Counseling Services.   After a long battle with Picker, &quot;we couldn't fightanymore,&quot; says John Keller, co-founder of ETEK, the firm thatwon a service contract on a Picker-made scanner. ETEK closeddown in 1989. It has sued Picker in federal court in Houston,charging that Picker used &quot;anti-competitive, illegal,unethical, fraudulent, and predatory tactics&quot; to drive the$5-million-a-year company out of business. The case isscheduled to be heard next February.   Picker denies ETEK's charges and denies harassingcompetitors.   In any event, health-care organizations have little choicebut to go along with the equipment makers in order to keepabreast of new technologies. Those that refuse face problemsranging from minor nuisances to major disruptions.   In August 1986, Monsour Medical Center in Pittsburghterminated its contract with Picker and hired ImagingEquipment Services Inc., which bid $54,000, compared withPicker's $104,000 quote. William Monsour, an internist at thehospital, says that a few days later Picker service engineersshowed up and removed maintenance and diagnostic software andmagnetic storage tapes and threatened to remove as well thesoftware necessary to operate the CT machine. &quot;We had a lotof down time as a result,&quot; says Dr. Monsour, who adds thateventually IES, which already had some Picker software,restored the machine to full service. Picker says it wouldnever remove operating software.   IES had the Picker software because its founder, ThomasQuinn, had obtained a license to use it at another hospital ayear earlier. But as IES increasingly encroached on Picker'sbusiness, Picker terminated that agreement in 1987, and itwants Mr. Quinn to return the software. IES refuses on theground that Picker's termination of the licensing agreementwas illegal. The issue is now a subject of lawsuits infederal court in Boston.   Leonard Morse Hospital in Natick, Mass., terminated Pickerin 1987. &quot;I was looking for ways to cut costs,&quot; says DennisL'Heureux, a vice president at the hospital. &quot;It got verycomplicated from then on.&quot; Picker demanded that all thediagnostic software and technical manuals be returned, butMr. L'Heureux refused. &quot;I said we bought them, and we shouldbe able to use them and have anyone else use them to fix ourmachine,&quot; he recalls. The two parties eventually reached anagreement allowing the hospital to keep the software andmanuals. A Picker attorney acknowledges that it made &quot;somesort of accommodation&quot; with the hospital.   Picker service engineers have been known to show upunannounced at radiology centers when they aren't likely tobe confronted. When a third party won the CT service contractat the City of Hope Radiology Center near Los Angeles, Pickerengineers staged a &quot;midnight raid&quot; to remove manuals plusoperating and diagnostic software when the site was unmanned,according to a court filing by R Squared.   Preston Strenth, who was an MRI service manager at Pickerand now works for R Squared, says field-service men areinstructed to take action as soon as Picker learns that it isabout to lose a contract. &quot;We would even remove the extenderboards {used for testing circuits} to make it difficult foranyone else to service the machine,&quot; he says. &quot;The goal wasto put up as many barriers as possible.&quot;   Although Picker prevents third parties from using itsdiagnostic software, it may not have the proprietary right itclaims. In 1986, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ordered aformer Picker employee to return Picker software he had takenwith him when he went to work for R Squared. But the courtdidn't act on Picker's request for an injunction against RSquared's using Picker software to service Picker CTmachines. R Squared had presented evidence that Picker'sdiagnostic software was merely a composite of software fromother manufacturers. The documents in the case are sealedunder a court order, which has kept other third parties inthe dark. Since that litigation, R Squared has been usingPicker's software, says Michael Nutter, R Squared's attorney,and &quot;they haven't come after us.&quot;   A Picker attorney says the extender boards &quot;are Picker'sproperty and are a part of service engineers' tool kits.&quot; Asfor R Squared using Picker's software, he says: &quot;We are notaware of any improper or unauthorized use by R Squared. Ifthey are, we will be making inquiries.&quot;   Picker has kept up the pressure in other ways. Some thirdparties allege that when they take business away from Picker,the machine in question mysteriously malfunctions -- usuallyafter visits, sometimes unannounced, by Picker engineers whocome to check the machine.   The Houston VA hospital, for instance, is awash inallegations and counterallegations over what happened after aPicker engineer was called in by a hospital radiologist tolook over the ETEK-serviced machine. The radiologist, JohnMayer, disliked having ETEK do the work. &quot;If you have aMercedes, do you take it to the mechanic at a local Texacostation for repair?&quot; he asks. Dr. Mayer eventually persuadedthe hospital to switch back to Picker, on the ground that themachine was producing inferior images and had other problems.   But James Brewster, then the hospital's chief CTtechnician, who testified in a sealed deposition, says therewas &quot;nothing wrong&quot; with the images. Rather, he says, afterthe Picker visit something &quot;suspicious&quot; happened; the imagesbecame &quot;grainy.&quot; The intention, he contends, was &quot;to makeETEK look bad.&quot; Picker calls the charge &quot;patently absurd&quot; andsays the visit didn't &quot;occur until considerably after the VAHouston began to experience performance problems with itsPicker CT scanner.&quot;   At Forbes Metro Health Center in Pittsburgh, KennethGesuale, administrative director for radiology, says in aninterview and in a signed report that one day he arrived atthe hospital at 7 a.m. to find a Picker employee leaving theradiology control room. The CT machine was still underwarranty with Picker, but Mr. Gesuale says he had notrequested service from the company. At that time, he adds, hewas &quot;in a talking stage&quot; to hire a third party.   Later, after the Picker man left, Mr. Gesuale alleges, themachine became &quot;noisy and inaccurate.&quot; Afterward, he says, &quot;ahorizontal drive motor&quot; was discovered to have been&quot;switched&quot; and an old one put in. Picker calls theallegations &quot;implausible&quot; and notes that Mr. Gesuale didn'tsee its employee remove any part.   In the litigation between IES and Picker in federal courtin Boston, Mr. Quinn, president of IES, alleged in adeposition that he found incidents of problems with machinesthat his company took over from Picker. He says he has foundpencil shavings in hard disks that eventually caused thedisks to &quot;crash,&quot; software bugs that rendered machinesinoperative, pulled cables, erased test programs on theoperational software, memory boards &quot;crushed with a pair ofpliers or something like that,&quot; and misadjusted cameras.   Picker officials dismiss such incidents as purefabrication. Picker's attorney says these &quot;mud-slinging&quot;charges only reflect how &quot;the game has become tense anddirty.&quot; But Robert Forino, a former senior vice president ofPicker and now president of Cleveland-based Jannx MedicalSystems Inc., says that &quot;occasionally individuals would takeactions that wouldn't be endorsed by the top people.&quot; Mr.Forino, who attributes the high cost of servicing medicalequipment to &quot;limited&quot; competition in the market, is now aconsultant to hospitals.   Mr. Strenth, the former Picker service manager, saysPicker sometimes asked him to do things that were&quot;unreasonable and unethical.&quot; He tells of flying with anotherPicker engineer to Panhandle Diagnostics in Amarillo, Texas.His instructions: &quot;remove key pieces&quot; of Picker's diagnosticmachines and render them inoperative, he says. &quot;It was notone of my proudest moments,&quot; he adds. Picker says Panhandleowed it money and it is part of Picker's &quot;contractualprovision&quot; to disable equipment involved in such disputes.   Picker also keeps third parties away from its CT machinesby warning health-care customers that only the Picker-madeDunlee X-ray tube is safe on its equipment. Third parties,which can't buy the Picker tube, have been purchasing anEimac tube made by Varian Associates Inc. Picker contendsthat the Eimac tube on its CT machine degrades the image andendangers patients.   The Office of the U.S. Inspector General recentlyinvestigated VA service contracts for Picker CTs. In a reportissued in June, it said it found &quot;restrictivespecifications,&quot; such as the use of Dunlee tubes, in 21 of 36contracts it reviewed. It added that these requirements&quot;could only have been achieved by the original equipmentmanufacturer, in this case, Picker.&quot; A Picker officialcriticizes the report, saying the VA &quot;didn't take intoaccount all the information we supplied.&quot;   Picker's Dunlee tube isn't the only part that thirdparties can't order from the manufacturer. &quot;After I switchedto a third party and placed an order for a coil, Picker neverresponded,&quot; says Charles McDonough, president of CTMFinancial Inc., a medical-equipment leasing concern inHouston. Adds Deno Parenti, a former Picker service engineerwho now works at Decades Services Inc., of Deer Park, N.Y.:&quot;When I call Picker for simple parts, they say there's a12-week wait. You can't wait around that long.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
