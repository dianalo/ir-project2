The big accounting firm also audited the books of many ofthe 45 small banks and credit unions that Rhode Island Gov.Bruce G. Sundlun closed Jan. 1. Some of the institutions havereopened after qualifying for federal deposit insurance, but14 of them -- including several audited by Ernst andamp; Young --remain closed because officials have found them too weakfinancially to qualify for federal insurance.</LP><TEXT>   Ernst andamp; Young, which says it couldn't have foreseen theinsurer's problems, is the latest auditor to come under firefor its role at failed banks and thrift institutions. InTexas and elsewhere, accounting firms are increasingly beingnamed in lawsuits that have followed the collapse of suchinstitutions. In Rhode Island -- where scores of suits havealready been filed -- the crisis has left customers withoutaccess to $1.3 billion in deposits frozen in 359,000accounts, deepening an already serious recession.   Ernst andamp; Young took on the now-collapsed Rhode Island Shareandamp; Deposit Indemnity Corp. in 1982 even though rival KPMG PeatMarwick earlier qualified its opinion of the firm's finances.Joseph M. Cianciolo, managing partner of Peat Marwick'sProvidence, R.I., office, said that in its final auditletter, &quot;we expressed doubts about whether the entity couldfulfill its mission with existing assets.&quot;   As a result, he said, &quot;we were fired.&quot;   An Ernst andamp; Young partner said the firm didn't have toqualify any of its audits of the insurer, citing improvementin the health of the member banks as the state's economyrebounded. The latest audit, which covered 1988 and 1989, wascompleted last Feb. 23.   Several suits filed in Rhode Island Superior Court againstthe deposit insurer also name its auditor as a co-defendant,although they don't cite Ernst andamp; Young by name. Ernst andamp; Youngsaid that the firm hasn't yet been named in any suit.   Harry A. Schult, managing partner of Ernst andamp; Young'sProvidence office, insisted that the firm couldn't haveforeseen the sharp decline in the value of real estate or thedepth of the recession the state experienced after the firmcompleted its audit.   He also said auditors couldn't have foreseen a $14 millionloss at the deposit insurer allegedly caused by embezzlementby the president of a member institution. That official,Joseph Mollicone Jr., has been charged in state and federalwarrants with embezzlement and is still at large.   &quot;We don't have a crystal ball,&quot; Mr. Schult said. He citeda $4 million loss the insurer absorbed in 1989 and said theauditors factored into their opinion the capacity to handlesome &quot;financial turmoil.&quot; But he said: &quot;What hit us here in1990 wasn't turmoil; it was a typhoon. And the regulatorsdidn't see it coming either.&quot;   State regulators checked the deposit insurer's books bothbefore and after Ernst andamp; Young did, and they didn't challengethe firm's conclusions, he said.   Federal regulators have been sharply critical of the RhodeIsland deposit insurer. Robert Loftus of the National CreditUnion Administration, which insures deposits at federalcredit unions, said that most private deposit insurers &quot;don'thave the necessary diversity to provide adequate protectionas an insurer.&quot;   To be safe, he said, &quot;there have to be a large number ofmembers to spread the risk,&quot; and that obviously wasn't thecase in Rhode Island. The National Credit UnionAdministration didn't have jurisdiction over the Rhode Islandcredit unions or their insurer, but it examined their booksas part of the process of evaluating them for coverage.</TEXT></DOC>
