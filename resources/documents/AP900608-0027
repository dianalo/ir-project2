The study was described Thrusday at a conference on the hazardsassociated with asbestos in place in schools and other publicbuildings.   In other studies, alarmingly high levels of lung damage werefound in construction workers who don't work directly with asbestos.Many previous studies have found elevated disease and death ratesamong workers who produced asbestos or worked with it. The newstudies find that asbestos is deadly even for construction workerswho do not use it in their jobs.   High levels of asbestos-related cancer were also found in schoolcustodians in three separate studies, suggesting that the asbestoshazard in schools is greater than anticipated, said Dr. Philip J.Landrigan of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.Landrigan was one of the conference's organizers.   ``The hazard of asbestos in place is more than we anticipated,''Landrigan said.   Jacques Dunnigan of The Asbestos Institute, which represents theinterests of Canadian asbestos mines, argued that Canadian asbestos,called chrysotile asbestos, is less dangerous than other forms.Asked about the reports at the conference, he said, ``It's very,very poor science that I'm listening to.''   Asbestos-related diseases _ lung cancer, a lung-scarring calledasbestosis and a cancer of the lung lining called mesothelioma _occur 20 to 30 years after exposure to asbestos.   Asbestos was widely used as insulation in schools and otherbuildings during the construction boom of the 1950s and 1960s, andso asbestos-related diseases are just beginning to appear.   These diseases now cause about 10,000 deaths per year, said Dr.Stephen M. Levin, also of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.   Joubert studied 878 children and wives of men who worked at anow-closed asbestos plant in Paterson, N.J. Of the 115 that havedied, 38 percent died of cancer, compared with an expected deathrate of 20 percent to 25 percent in the general population.   Dr. Laura Welch of George Washington University in Washingtonfound that 40 percent of sheet metal workers _ who do not useasbestos in their work _ had asbestos-related lung damage, aprecursor of asbestosis or cancer. They were exposed to asbestos onconstruction sites, Welch said.   Landrigan found the same asbestos-related lung damage infirefighters with at least 20 years of service. Their rate of lungdamage was seven times that of the general population. Thefirefighters are typically exposed to asbestos when they enterbuildings after fires have been put out, he said.   Levin reported the results of a study in which he and hiscolleagues examined 660 New York City school custodians 20 yearsafter any possible exposure to asbestos. The researchers found that28 percent of the custodians had asbestos-related lung damage.   ``It was somewhat surprising,'' he said. ``We knew exposureoccurred, but while we expected to see some disease, the ratessurprised us.'' Similar findings were reported from independentstudies in Los Angeles and Boston, Levin said.   An article in Science magazine in January argued that asbestos inschools and other buildings was not a significant hazard.   Scientists at the New York conference were sharply critical ofthat article, which they said was already causing some buildingowners and regulatory agencies to be less diligent in containing orremoving asbestos.</TEXT></DOC>
