The company said the earnings surge resulted largely from $62.2 million in profit from discontinued operations related to its previously announced restructuring. The quarter also included an extraordinary loss of $3.6 million for prepayment of debt and a $15.4 million charge related to the company's restructuring efforts.    During the quarter, the company sold off its Lamb-Weston potato-processing unit for $276 million and its pharmaceutical distribution unit for $120 million in a leveraged buy-out. The company also sold its mushroom-growing business for $30 million.    For the quarter, the company had revenue of $150.5 million compared with $145.7 million a year ago.    For the six months, Amfac had net of $47.6 million, or $2.77 a share, compared with $4.7 million, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue declined to $281.6 million from $285.5 million last year.    The six months included profit from discontinued operations of $67 million, reflecting the sale of several operations; a loss of $15.9 million from continuing operations and an extraordinary charge of $3.6 million.    As reported, Amfac shed some of its assets even as a management group in May proposed taking the company private in a bid that was valued at about $800 million. The bid fell short, and the company last month agreed to JMB Realty's $920 million, or $49-a-share, offer.    Amfac has substantial real-estate holdings in Hawaii, as well as interests in wholesale distribution, food processing, retailing, agriculture and resorts.    Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Amfac closed $46, off 75 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
