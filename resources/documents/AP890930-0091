Scientists said the magma gushed from a 500-foot crater thatopened 8,500 feet up the mountain after a series of tremors onThursday.   News reports said the river of lava was 15 yards wide and hadsnaked down to the 4,500-foot level, still oozing forward at about10 yards an hour.   Mount Etna began its latest eruption on Sept. 11. Volcanoexperts say there is no danger to any of the hamlets near themountain, which are protected by a series of peaks and valleys thatwould channel the lava away from them.</TEXT></DOC>
