An alphabetical index in six languages and an additionalindex of Latin names and terms in current use means that the dictionarycan be used as a technical dictionary as well as a systematic guide toterminology. Each term has been consecutively numbered throughout thesystematic part of the dictionary. Since these numbers recur in everyindex, entries are both easy to find and easy to read. A natural selectionhad constantly to be made from the wealth of possible terms. Whereverpossible, however, terms that are characteristic of a particular regionhave also been taken into account. The same is true of linguistic differences,e.g. between American and British English and between European and AmericanSpanish as well as of regional peculiarities in language use in Germany,Austria, Switzerland, France and Belgium. Where popular plant names inaddition to the scientific ones could not be ascertained - as was thecase for Spanish, in particular - only the Latin names are listed, inaccordance with general practice in Spanish specialist literature.</TEXT></DOC>
