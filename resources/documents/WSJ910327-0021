The stock sale follows Mr. Simmons's move last year to use$100 million in cash from Baroid to capitalize a new company,leaving Baroid with $100 million in new debt. But despite itsadditional leverage, Baroid is much healthier than it waswhen Mr. Simmons acquired it in 1986 as a money-losing unitof NL Industries Inc.</LP><TEXT>   Valhi Inc., a holding company controlled by Mr. Simmonsthat owns 42% of Baroid, said it plans to sell about 15million Baroid shares through a public offering. Valhi alsois offering underwriters the option of selling as many as 2.3million more shares. Altogether, the sale would reduceValhi's stake to between 19% and 22% of Baroid's 74.1 millionshares outstanding.   Proceeds from the sale will be used to repay part ofValhi's $252 million in bank debt, increasing Mr. Simmons'sborrowing ability for future acquisitions. Michael A.Snetzer, Valhi president, said the company doesn't intend toreduce its credit lines of $275 million from a group led byCiticorp and Societe Generale.   In addition to that borrowing ability, NL, a Houstonchemicals company that is 68% owned by Valhi, has about $480million cash from its recent sale of 19% of Lockheed Corp.'sstock and its own unused credit lines.   Mr. Snetzer said that Mr. Simmons doesn't have immediateplans for the cash, but said that he is continuing to lookfor &quot;major investments,&quot; and that &quot;if the opportunitypresents itself, we'll do something.&quot;   In the meantime, Mr. Simmons said in a U.S. filing that hewill treat his Baroid stake solely as an investment after thestock sale. After his stake is reduced, his brother GlennSimmons, Valhi vice chairman, will resign from Baroid's boardand an unaffiliated director will be named, giving Simmonsrepresentatives three board seats. Yesterday, Hugh J. Kelly,former chief executive of Ocean Drilling andamp; Exploration Co.,was named to the board, increasing it to seven members.   One of Mr. Simmons's top strategists, J. Landis Martin,currently is chairman and chief executive officer of Baroid,but even that may change when Baroid executives are electedafter the April annual meeting. Mr. Martin, also NL's chiefexecutive, couldn't be reached for comment.   The market didn't take to the news favorably. Baroid fell37.5 cents to close at $7.25 in New York Stock Exchangecomposite trading yesterday.   Still, Mr. Martin has boasted about the turnaround atBaroid, which was bleeding badly when Mr. Simmons acquiredit. After spinning it off from NL in 1988, Mr. Martin slashedcosts, cut the work force and sold divisions, while focusingon the company's drilling services and drilling fluidsbusineses. For 1990, the company reported net income of $44million, or 62 cents a share, up from $17 million, or 28cents a share, in 1989.   But his management also has angered some stockholders, whodidn't want to participate in Mr. Simmons' investments. LastAugust, Baroid spun off its bentonite mining and titaniumbusinesses into Tremont Corp. and borrowed $100 million tocapitalize the new company. Tremont, which is 44% owned byValhi, then said it might use the cash in Simmons-relatedinvestments.   The company &quot;is not as healthy as it was last August,&quot;said Suzanne Cook, an oil services analyst for Merrill Lynch.But she said Mr. Simmons's reduced role may allow the companyto be included in more oil-field services portfolios andresult &quot;in less controversy surrounding Baroid.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
