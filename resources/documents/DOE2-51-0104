Anterior sagittal displacement of the tibia was recorded on theroutine standing radiographs in 16 knees all having a normal femoro-tibialalignment in the non-weight-bearing position. Five of eleven patientswith sagittal displacement of between 10 and 19 mm had early osteoarthrosis,which was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging in four cases; theirages ranged from 23 to 38 years. No radiographic signs of osteoarthrosiswere observed in those with displacements of less than 10 mm. In somepatients there was a discrepancy between the clinical and radiographicmeasurements of instability. In addition to the clinical tests of instabilitystanding rather than non-weight-bearing lateral radiographs are suggestedfor the routine assessment of cruciate ligament injuries.</TEXT></DOC>
