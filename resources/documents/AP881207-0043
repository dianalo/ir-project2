Members of Congress who call for defense reductions say little``about overseas threats or `military realities' which do notconform to their version of political reality,'' Adm. William J.Crowe Jr., the joint chiefs chairman, said Tuesday.   Crowe said in a speech he wants to help improve Pentagonmanagement and to convince Congress that stable financing instead ofpeak-and-valley cycles could save huge amounts of money.   Crowe said that while changes may be called for, ``it would be agrievous _ and probably, ultimately disabling _ error to undertakethose adjustments with an eye only to the concerns of accountants.''</TEXT></DOC>
