(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Japan's Nippon Mining Co. Ltd.plans to shell out $1.1 billion to buy Gould Inc., an electronicsmaker struggling to reduce its debt and reverse a string of losses.   Nippon Mining, one of Japan's 50 largest industrial firms, willlaunch a tender offer to purchase all of Gould's 45 millionoutstanding common shares of stock for $23.25 a share, thecompanies said in a joint statement issued Tuesday.   The buyout is one of the biggest ever of a U.S. industrialcompany by a Japanese concern, topped only by Bridgestone Corp.'sacquisition of Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. for $2.6 billionearlier this year.   ``This transaction fits well with our strategy to enhance thefocus, development and growth of the materials and componentsbusiness, particularly copper foil, fuses and fiber optics,'' saidGould Chairman James F. McDonald.   Gould's stock price soared in late trading on the New York StockExchange. Gould closed up $7.12{ a share at $22.75.   Gould posted a net loss of $95.6 million last year on revenue of$933.4 million. It has been shedding divisions _ mostly thoseinvolve in defense manufacturing _ for several years in an attemptto reduce its long-term debt, which stood at $250 million at theend of June.   On Monday, the company announced it was selling its oceansystems division, which makes underwater listening equipment forthe Navy, to Martin Marietta Corp. for $117 million.   Nippon Mining, already Gould's partner in two enterprises,intends to proceed with Gould's plan to divest its remainingdefense systems business, the statement read.   Gould, based in suburban Rolling Meadows, will retain its nameand operate as Nippon Mining's wholly-owned subsidiary.   Gould has 6,500 employees in its remaining businesses and 80people at its trimmed-down headquarters. While the companyofficially said it has yet to determine how employees will beaffected by the deal, analysts believe most jobs will remain inplace, including top management positions.   ``Basically, I see no signs of change in headquarters oremployment relationships for an 18-month period. It will be handsoff for a while,'' said Julian Menear, an analyst with the Pershingdivision of Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette in Chicago.   McDonald said the transaction was ``based first and foremost onmaximizing share value for our stockholders.''   ``By further combining the resources of our two companies, webelieve there is great potential for these businesses to expand,''he said in the statement.   Nippon Mining President Yukio Kasahara expressed ``deep respectand admiration'' for Gould's products and employees.   ``Gould has a very solid core business in materials andcomponents,'' he said. ``Despite some of the difficultiesexperienced by the company in the recent past, we have greatconfidence in the future of that business.''   Gould and Nippon Mining, which earned $59.8 million last year onsales of $6.5 billion, have been partners since 1981 in Nikko GouldFoil Co. Ltd., which makes electroplated copper foil.   Should Gould accept a competing offer to be acquired by anothercompany, the agreement contains a provision giving Nippon Mining anoption to purchase Gould's 50 percent stake in Nikko Gould Foil for$60 million.   In July, Gould and Nippon Mining formed another joint venture,Nippon Gould Computer Co. Ltd., to market superminicomputers inJapan.   In addition to their joint enterprises, Nippon Mining marketsGould fuses and fiber optic products.</TEXT></DOC>
