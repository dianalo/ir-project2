An Israeli policeman shot and killed a Palestinian man whoattacked him with an ax.   The curfew, confining Palestinians in the occupied territoriesto their homes, was maintained for a sixth straight day followingviolent protests over the assassination of PLO military leaderKhalil Wazir.   Two Palestinians were shot to death by Israeli troops during theprotests Friday in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank.   A paramilitary border policeman shot and killed a Palestinianman who attacked him with an ax during a protest in the West Bankvillage of Qabatiya, the army said without identifying the dead man.   Arab reports said the demonstration in the village 43 milesnorth of Jerusalem was to protest Wazir's slaying. The army saiddozens of Palestinians participated.   In Bethlehem, some 200 youths, many masking their faces withtheir Arab headdresses, hurled rocks at troops in the Aida refugeecamp.   An Associated Press reporter saw soldiers fire tear gas andrubber bullets at the protesters. Witnesses said a 7-year-old Arabboy was injured by rubber bullets and nine residents suffered fromtear gas inhalation.   In the Gaza Strip's Maghazi refugee camp, troops arrested twoArabs after a firebomb was thrown at an army patrol, Israel radiosaid. No injuries were reported.   The death on Saturday brought to 172 the number of Arabs killedsince the uprising began 19 weeks ago. An Israeli teen-ager and anarmy soldier also have perished.   Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising had called for a``Day of Rage'' in the occupied territories Saturday to mark a weeksince Wazir's death.   In Gaza City, burning tires filled the air with smoke. Mostshops were closed in response to a call for a general strike. Butvendors sold fruits, vegetables and other goods from carts on thestreets.   The army curfew Saturday covered the Gaza Strip and the WestBank towns of Anabta and Nablus, population 100,000, along with 20refugee camps in the former Jordanian territory.   The army said it would lift on Sunday a four-day-old ban ontravel to Israel by residents of the occupied lands.   Israeli leaders had predicted that the uprising against Israel's21-year occupation would falter both because of strong army actionand economic strains on the Palestinians caused by repeated generalstrikes.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on Israel's 40th anniversaryThursday that he believed violence would end soon in the occupiedterritories.   An Israeli scholar said Saturday, however, that Wazir'sassassination, which has been blamed on Israel, could prompt morebloodshed.   ``We may see more terrorist operations not only against Israelitargets in Israel itself,'' Asher Sasser of Tel Aviv Universitytold Israel Radio. ``There may be more terrorist operations againstIsraeli objectives in Europe which Fatah at least has abstainedfrom for quite a few years.''   Sasser, a terrorism expert, said that the PLO's mainstream Fatahgroup may see the killing of Wazir ``as a change of the rules inthe war with Israel, that they would now be able to justifyoperations against Israeli targets in Europe.''   Wazir, a close associate of PLO leader Yasser Arafat, was slainat his home in Tunis, Tunisia, on April 16. Tunisian authoritiesand informed Israeli sources have said the assassination wascarried out by Israeli commandos.   Israeli officials have said that Wazir directed much of theuprising in the occupied territories, but Sasser said he doubtedWazir's death would cause either a sudden outburst of violence oran end to the uprising.   ``I think it should be recognized that the uprising in the WestBank was not a PLO-organized phenomena,'' he said. ``Although thePLO certainly supported and encouraged the uprising, it was nottotally controlled or initiated by the organization.''</TEXT></DOC>
