No. 34-26545; File No. SR-NASD-88-19]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Self-Regulatory Organizations; Amended Proposed Rule Change by NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers, Inc. Relating to the OTC Bulletin BoardDisplay Service</ITAG>Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15U.S.C 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on February 2, 1989, the NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') filed with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission an amended rule change proposal as described inItems I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD.The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the amendedrule change from interested persons.I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance ofthe Proposed Rule ChangeOn June 9, 1988, the NASD submitted a proposed rule change (designatedFile No. SR-NASD-88-19), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934 (the ``Act'') and Rule 19b-4 thereunder, to establishthe OTC Bulletin Board Display Service (``Bulletin Board Service'' or ``Service''),respecting securities traded over-the-counter (``OTC'') that are not includedin the NASDAQ System or listed on a national securities exchange (collectivelyreferred to as ``Bulletin Board Securities''). Basically, the Service constitutesan electronic quotation medium that market makers can employ to enter quotesor indications of trading interest in Bulletin Board Securities. Marketmakers will also have the capacity to update their entries on a real-timebasis. Originally, the NASD proposed to provide the Service for a pilotperiod of six months. No fee was to be charged during the pilot, but acost-based charge was planned thereafter. During the pilot phase, real-timeaccess to the Service would be limited to NASD member firms utilizing NASDAQterminal devices or NASDAQ Workstation units authorized for Level 2 orLevel 3 NASDAQ service. The principal operational features of the Servicewere full described in File No. SR-NASD-88-19 under Item 3, ``Self-RegulatoryOrganization's Statement of the Purposes of, and Statutory Basis for, theProposed Rule Change.'' \1\<NOTE/> Because that material remains unchanged, it is hereby incorporatedby reference.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ This description was also contained in the Commission'snotice that solicited public comments on File No. SR-NASD-88-19. <T3>See,</T3> Release No. 34-25949 (July 28, 1988); 53 FR 29096 (August2, 1988). On August 10, 1988, the NASD submitted a technical amendment(Amendment No. 1) describing the unsolicited indicator that market makerscould attach to a bid or offer being displayed on behalf of a retail customer.In making this filing, the NASD has incorporated several modificationsthat reflect a working agreement between the NASD and Commerce ClearingHouse, Inc./National Quotation Bureau, Inc. (``CCH/NQB''). The NASD intendsto implement the Service only if it is approved by the Commission in theform provided by this Amendment to File No. SR-NASD-88-19. Accordingly,the NASD reserves the right to withdraw Amendment No. 2 to File No. SR-NASD-88-19should the Commission (i) determine to approve the Service in a form thateither CCH/NQB or the NASD determines, in good faith, is materially differentfrom this Amendment or (ii) issue an approval order conditioned upon makingfurther modifications that either CCH/NQB or the NASD determines, in goodfaith, to be materially different from this Amendment. If either of theforegoing occurs, the NASD will withdraw Amendment No. 2 and, prior toimplementing the Service in any form, submit another Rule 19b-4 filingto the Commission and take such other action that may be required to causethe Commission to order a new comment period with respect to the Service.These actions would preserve CCH/NQB's rights to comment in full on theentire Service if this Amendment is withdrawn.The instant filing proposes the following amendments to the terms of thepilot program for the Bulletin Board Service:(1) The pilot operation would run for a term of one year, with actual operationscommencing shortly after the date of the Commission's approval order.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ If the pilot demonstrates the Service's viability, theNASD will submit another Rule 19b-4 filing to obtain Commission approvalof the Service on a permanent basis and the implementation of cost-basedsubscriber fees.(2) During the pilot, NASD members utilizing NASDAQ authorized equipmentwill not incur a separate service charge for access to market makers' inputcaptured in the Service's data base.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Since this information will be available through standardNASDAQ terminals, the charges applicable to NASDAQ Level 2/3 service andequipment, including charges for individual queries, will continue to apply.(3) During the pilot, NASD members that register as market makers in BulletinBoard Securities (``Market Maker Participants'' or ``Participants'') willincur a charge for displaying their trading interest through the service.Specifically, a Market Maker Participant will pay $85 per month for thefirst 10 securities listings (or any part thereof), and $37 per month foreach additional lot of five listings (or any part thereof) or $74 per monthfor each additional lot of ten listings (or any part thereof).\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ In this context, ``listing'' refers to a line of quotations,priced or unpriced, firm or non-firm, one-sided or two-sided, or indicationsof interest entered by a Participant in a Bulletin Board Security.(4) For the pilot term, the NASD will provide to CCH/NQB, twice daily,a static transmission of data captured in the Service's data base.\5\<NOTE/> The first transmission will occur at approximately 12 noonEastern time and be used in connection with publication of the next day'sPink SheetsTM. The second transmission, consisting of end-of-day information,will occur after the Service closes and be provided to subscribers of CCH/NQB'selectronic delivery service the following morning.\6\<NOTE/> As to both the Pink SheetsTM and CCH/NQB's electronic deliveryservice, the priced entries of Market Maker Participants will appear inthe form of a stringline. Each Market Maker Participant will be identifiedby a four character alpha symbol followed by the firm's bid and/or offeredprices, and an indicator to designate whether the bid and/or offered priceis firm. In instances where a Participant enters only a bid or an offeredprice, an alpha prefix designating the price as a bid or offer will appear.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The elements of information which will be transmittedto CCH/NQB from the Service's data base include, but need not be limitedto: (i) market maker identifications (including trading room telephonenumbers if authorized by the individual Market Maker Participants); (ii)security identifications and symbols used by the NASD; (iii) all pricedentries as well as indications of interest inserted by Participants; and(iv) any condition codes applicable to individual securities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Presently, CCH/NQB is the only vendor of static, OTC quotationinformation that has expressed interest in receiving such a transmission.CCH/NQB currently has agreements with other vendors to electronically disseminatestatic information contained in the printed Pink SheetsTM.(5) The NASD will not assess CCH/NQB a charge for the static transmissionsof data from the Service's data base. CCH/NQB, however, will bear all costsassociated with the telecommunication line and any support equipment neededto receive or process the NASD's transmissions.(6) During the twelve-month pilot, CCH/NBQ will continue to collect, process,make available: static quotation information respecting OTC equity securitieslisted in either the Pink Sheets TM or the Service through the Pink SheetsTM publication and the electronic delivery service; historic price, corporate,and issuer information respecting OTC equity securities quoted in the PinkSheets TM or the Service through various copyrighted publications;\7\<NOTE/> quotation information on OTC debt securities through publicationof the Yellow Sheets; and historical price and issuer information on OTCdebt securities through other copyrighted publications (<T3>i.e., National Monthly Bond Summary</T3> and <T3>National Bond Summary</T3>). CCH/NQB will also continue to provideits customary research and library services to market professionals andthe public. Additionally, CCH/NQB will continue to monitor market makers'compliance with Rule 15c2-11 under the Act and coordinate those functionswith the NASD. For example, CCH/NQB will verify that a market maker whoseeks to place a new listing in the Service or Pink Sheets TM has filedthe information required by Rule 15c2-11(a)(5) with CCH/NQB. If the requiredinformation has not been filed respecting a security eligible for the Service,CCH/NQB will notify the NASD. Upon such notification, NASD will requestthe market maker to produce that information or justify the basis for claimingan exemption.\8\<NOTE/> With respect to market maker listings in the Pink SheetsTM (<T3>i.e.,</T3> excluding listings in the Service), NQB will request themarket maker to produce the required information or provide justificationfor an exemption.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ These publications are: (i) <T3>NQB Price Digest,</T3> (ii) <T3>Monthly Price Report,</T3> (iii) <T3>Single Sheet,</T3> (iv) <T3>Weekly Market Maker Report,</T3> (v) <T3>National Monthly Stock Summary,</T3> and (vi) <T3>National Stock Summary.</T3> Exhibit 2 of this filing contains a commentletter (dated November 14, 1988) from John L. Watson, III, President, NationalSecurities Traders Association (``NSTA Letter''). The NSTA Letter atteststo the importance of CCH/NQB's historical records and research servicesrespecting OTC securities quoted in the Pink Sheets TM. In particular,the NSTA Letter notes the value of these informational resources to thesecurities industry, as well as to accountants and tax attorneys who arerequired to value Pink Sheets TM securities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ CCH/NQB will transmit a copy of the required informationsupplied by a Market Maker Participant to the Commission and the NASD atleast two days prior to publication of a new listing in the Service. CCH/NQBwill be capable of making Rule 15c2-11 information available to other broker-dealersupon request. Thus, the NASD and CCH/NQB will coordinate their activitiesto avoid imposing duplicative filing burdens upon Market Maker Participants.(7) In consideration of (i) CCH/NQB's continued provision of Rule 15c2-11support services for its subscribers and for Market Maker Participants,(ii) continued maintenance and publication of Pink Sheets TM, Yellow Sheetsand the historical data base of price and issuer information and relatedresearch services to market professionals and the public, (iii) the potentialloss of Pink Sheets TM listing fees as a result of the Service's introduction,(iv) an agreement not to create a system in competition with the Servicefor up to three years and not to raise any objections to the Service inconnection with the Commission's consideration of this amended rule change,subject to certain time limitations and compliance with the terms of theagreement between CCH/NQB and the NASD, and (v) in settlement of all claimsand disputes, real or potential, between CCH/NQB and the NASD, subjectto certain time limitations and compliance the terms of the agreement betweenCCH/NQB and the NASD, an amount derived from the Participant fees proposedin this filing will be paid to CCH/NQB. The proposed fees are identicalto those assessed by CCH/NQB for market maker listings in the Pink SheetsTM. The NASD's agreement with CCH/NQB is premised upon the public interestin ensuring the continuation of an industry capability for the collectionand dissemination of OTC securities information should the NASD eventuallyterminate or limit the scope of the Service. Likewise, for the pilot term,the NASD desires that public investors and securities professionals havecontinued access to CCH-NQB's historical price information and researchservices respecting issues quoted in the Pink Sheets TM or in the Service.Finally, at the conclusion of the Service's pilot period, the NASD willrebate to Market Maker Participants any Service revenue remaining aftersatisfaction of the NASD's obligations to CCH/NQB and recovery of costsincurred in developing and operating the pilot Service.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization includedstatements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule changeand discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. Thetext of these statements may be examined at the places specified in ItemIV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, setforth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspectsof such statements.A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and StatutoryBasis for, the Proposed Rule ChangeThe purposes of this amendatory filing are threefold: (1) To provide aone-year term for pilot operation of the Bulletin Board Service; (2) toprovide workable procedures for distributing, on a static basis, selectedinformation collected through the Service during the pilot period; and(3) to obtain authorization for a temporary listing charge to be leviedon Market Maker Participants. The operational features of the Service,as detailed in File No. SR-NASD-88-19, are not modified by this amendment.The instant filing would permit the NASD to offer the Bulletin Board Serviceto its members for an extended period without undermining CCH/NQB's capacityto serve a much broader base of end users via the Pink Sheets TM. The twelve-monthpilot will allow a truly meaningful test of the Service's viability basedupon the breadth and frequency of market makers' participation, and thenumber of securities routinely quoted in the Service. Such factors willbe critical to the NASD's determination whether to offer the Service ona permanent basis. Likewise, the proposed pilot will furnish objectivedata to support calculation of cost-based fees applicable to Market MakerParticipants and subscribers of private vendors that opt to distributereal-time information from the Service's data base after the pilot period.The NASD's provision of static data feeds to CCH/NQB recognizes the historicimportance of the Pink Sheets TM as both a quotation medium and a researchtool that is widely used within the securities industry. Although the PinkSheets TM include numerous issues that would not be eligible for the Service(<T3>e.g.,</T3> equity securities that are either exchange-listed or includedin NAS-DAQ), the majority of Pink Sheets TM issues would be immediatelyeligible for quotation by Market Maker Participants. These Participantscould determine simultaneously to relinquish their Pink Sheets TM listingsin favor of the Bulletin Board Service. Such action would jeopardize continuanceof the Pink Sheets TM and related CCH/NQB Services, particularly to non-membersand non-participants in the pilot Service. To avoid such consequences,the NASD proposes to furnish the static data feeds previously describedand to make certain payments to CCH/NQB derived from the Participant feescontained in this filing. The sum to be paid to CCH/NQB, if any, for continuationof its existing services will be calculated from a formula that reckonsa possible reduction in Pink Sheets TM listing revenues during the Service'spilot period. Separately, during that period, the NASD will reimburse CCH/NQBfor the costs of performing the following activities: monitoring marketmakers' compliance with Rule 15c2-11 with respect to quotations initiatedin the Pink Sheets TM and/or the Service; preparation, maintenance anddistribution of CCH/NQB's historical database of price and issuer informationto market professionals and the public; and provision of customary libraryand research services for market professionals and the public. Assumingthat the pilot program proceeds successfully, the NASD will develop appropriateaccess terms (including cost-based fees) for vendors to distribute selectedinformation captured in the Service's data base to subscribers of theiron-line services. At that point, broker-dealers and the investing publicwill have the option of choosing a printed medium that contains staticquotation information, or an electronic medium that provides on-line accessto market makers' current quotations/indications of interest with respectto Bulletin Board Securities. However, during the Service's pilot term,the Pink Sheets TM should remain the most comprehensive and widely-availablesource of market information for thousands of securities traded exclusivelyOTC.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Similarly, the CCH/NQB's Yellow Sheets publication containsquotations for thousands of debt securities traded over-the-counter. Thosesecurities would not be eligible for quotation through the Service duringthe Pilot Period. The NASD reserves the right to do so after Pilot Periodthrough it currently has no intent to do so.The final element of this amendment is the NASD's obtaining authorizationfor the proposed listing charges to be paid by Market Maker Participants.These charges are identical to the fees currently assessed by CCH/NQB forbroker-dealers to maintain Pink Sheets TM listings for individual securities.As noted earlier, a portion of the revenues from Participant fees may bepayable to CCH/NQB (assuming a diminution of Pink Sheets TM listing revenuestraceable to the Service's introduction) in consideration for its continuationof the Pink Sheets TM and other services that provide market informationon OTC securities. This approach is appropriate because of the potentialfor constriction or discontinuance of the NASD's Service during the pilotperiod. Further, a portion of the revenues received by the NASD will beused to reimburse CCH/NQB for the costs of monitoring market makers compliancewith Rule 15c2-11 <T3>vis-a-vis</T3> the Pink Sheets TM and the Service; preparation, maintenance,and distribution of CCH/NQB's historical data base of price and issuerinformation to market professionals and the public; and provision of customarylibrary and research services. Both private investors and market professionalsrely upon these services for information on securities that are tradedexclusively OTC and not on NASDAQ. Finally, the fee schedule proposed forMarket Maker Participants will not extend beyond the Service's pilot period.Any excess revenues remaining after satisfaction of the NASD's obligationsto CCH/NQB and recovery of costs traceable to the Service's pilot developmentand operation will be rebated to Participants after the pilot's conclusion.By that time the NASD will have calculated cost-based fees to accompanyoperation of the Bulletin Board Service on a permanent basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">CCH/NQB_NASD Agreement</ITAG>The principal elements of this filing stem from a working agreement recentlyconsummated between CCH/NQB and the NASD. The structure of that agreementencompasses various undertakings that will facilitate: (i) Prompt initiationof the Service's pilot operation by obviating any potential claims or objectionsthat CCH/NQB might assert, subject to certain time limitations and compliancewith the agreement's terms; (ii) use of CCH/NQB's historical records, personnel,and expertise relative to continued monitoring of market makers' compliancewith Rule 15c2-11(a)(5) under the Act; (iii) continued availability ofthe Pink SheetsTM for the duration of the Service's pilot, particularlyto parties who will not be eligible for on-line access to the Service;(iv) potential enhancement of Pink SheetsTM information delivered to CCH/NQB'ssubscribers, as a result of the static data feeds received from the NASD;(v) maintenance of CCH/NQB's historical records, library/research services,and other market data publications covering OTC securities; and (vi) achievementof the broadest possible exposure of Market Maker Participants' pricedquotations in Bulletin Board Securities.It should be emphasized that the pilot program is intended to test theviability of the Service to market makers in eligible securities. If thepilot proves successful, it could eventually lead CCH/NQB to restrict orterminate the Pink SheetsTM as a printed quotation medium. For the pilotterm, however, the NASD believes that the goals of investor protectionand maintenance of fair and orderly OTC markets are best served by ensuringcontinued production of the Pink SheetsTM (as supplemented by the dailyfeeds from the Service's data base) and continuance of other publicationsand services cutomarily provided by CCH/NQB. Market Maker Participantsin the Service will also benefit from exposure of their priced quotationsin the Pink SheetsTM, the most comprehensive and widely available quotationmedium that currently exists for OTC securities. The costs associated withthat the NASD's proposed charges are identical to CCH/NQB's Pink SheetsTMlisting fees. CCH/NQB has committed not to increase these fees during theterm of Service's pilot. Hence, a market maker in Bulletin Board Securitiesthat opts to substitute the Service for the Pink SheetsTM will not incuradditional costs unless the firm increases the number of securities inwhich it currently displays interest via the Pink SheetsTM.The CCH/NQB_NASD agreement effectively provides an interim period (thepilot period for the Bulletin Board Service) for CCH/NQB to evaluate alternativebusiness opportunities in the event that the Service renders the Pink SheetsTMobsolete. The agreement does not create any competitive advantage for CCH/NQB<T3>vis</T3>-<T3>a</T3>-<T3>vis </T3>other vendors of printed quotation mediums or vendors thatdisseminate OTC market information electronically. During the Service'spilot, the NASD is prepared to furnish static data feeds to other entitiesthat produce publications comparable to the Pink SheetsTM on substantiallythe same terms as provided for in the CCH/NQB_NASD agreement. However,until the Service demonstrates its viability, the NASD will not be in aposition to formulate cost-based fees for vendors wishing to offer on-lineaccess to the Service's data base during the trading day. The NASD willaddress those matters with interested vendors during the Service's pilotperiod.Additionally, in consideration of the payments prescribed under the termsof the CCH/NQB_NASD agreement, CCH/NQB will refrain from developing aninteractive service comparable to the Bulletin Board Service for up tothree years from the date of the pilot's commencement. This element reflectsCCH/NQB's decision to consider business options that may be more closelyrelated to their traditional data compilation and publication activities.As noted above, the CCH/NQB_NASD agreement contemplates that CCH/NQB willsupport and not raise objections to the NASD's provision of the Serviceunder the amended terms of the pilot program and coordinate with the NASDthe tasks related to monitoring market makers' compliance with ExchangeAct Rule 15c2-11. The covenants regarding non-competition and non-objectionto operation of the Service in accord with this Amendment are subject tocertain time limitations and the parties' strict adherence to the termsof the agreement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Statutory Bases</ITAG>In submitting File No. SR-NASD-88-19, the NASD cited sections 11A(a)(1),15A(b)(6) and (11) of the Act as providing the statutory bases for theBulletin Board Service. Further, the NASD explained how the Service's designand operational features would further the statutory intent of each provision.Because Amendment No. 2 to File No. SR-NASD-88-19 does not modify the systemdesign or operational features of the Service, the NASD hereby reiteratesits earlier statement on the statutory bases that could sustain the Commission'sapproval of the Service.Amendment No. 2 to File No. SR-NASD-88-19 involves the imposition of afee upon Market Maker Participants. Therefore, it is necessary to examinethat fee in relation to the requirements of section 15A(b)(5) of the Act.That provision requires the equitable allocation of reasonable chargesamong members for the use of any facility or system that the NASD operates.The proposed fee structure tracks that of CCH/NQB for market maker listingsin the Pink SheetsTM publication. The NASD believes this to be a reasonablestandard for establishing an interim fee applicable to the Service's pilotphase. Such a standard is appropriate because of the NASD's present inabilityto project the user population over which the Service's costs could bespread, the extent to which OTC market makers will elect to become Participants,or the additional subscriber population that may be interested in receivingBulletin Board information after the pilot has terminated. Absent thesedata, it is logical to reference the fees charged for market maker listingsin the most comparable quotation medium for OTC securities. Essentially,Market Maker Participants will be asked to pay no more and no less thanthey currently pay to display priced entries in OTC securities via a widely-recognizedquotation medium. Thus, OTC market makers choosing the Service in lieuof the Pink SheetsTM will not incur additional costs unless they increasetheir respective market making commitments in eligible securities. Sinceparticipation in the Service in voluntary, individual market makers willassess whether the Service or one of the printed quotation mediums (includingthe Pink SheetsTM) is best suited to their needs. Based on the foregoing,the NASD believes that the interim fees proposed for the Service are consistentwith section 15A(b)(5) of the Act.Clearly, the amended terms for the Service will foster continuance of thePink SheetsTM during the pilot term. This result is justified by the experimentalcharacter of the Service, the exclusion of listed and NASDAQ securitiesfrom the potential universe of Bulletin Board Securities, and the limitationof real-time access to the Service's data base to NASD firms with NASDAQequipment. As a quotation medium, the Pink SheetsTM currently provide themost inclusive listing of securities traded OTC along with the identitiesof market makers in those securities. Consequently, the Pink SheetsTM constitutea valuable resource tool that is used widely by the securities professionalsand public investors. Until the Service has proven its viability, the NASDbelieves that the Pink SheetsTM should be preserved as quotation mediumfor OTC securities.\1\\0\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the NASD submits that Commission approval ofthe amended Bulletin Board Service may be grounded upon the Congressionalfindings in Subsections (B) and (C) of Section 11A(a)(1) of the Act. Subsection(B) states that new data processing and communications techniques createthe opportunities for more efficient and effective market operations. Additionally,under Subsection (C), the Congress found that the goals of investor protectionand the maintenance of fair and orderly markets are advanced by broadeningthe dissemination of quotations for all classes of securities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ Similarly, the public interest compels maintenanceof CCH/NQB's unique combination of publications and research services forOTC securities generally.Lastly, the NASD relies upon section 15(A)(b)(11) of the Act in supportof this amendatory filing. That provision empowers the NASD to regulatethe form and content of quotations distributed on OTC securities. Morespecifically, such regulations must be structured to produce fair and informativequotations, to prevent misleading quotations, and to promote orderly proceduresfor collecting, distribution and publishing quotations. The NASD believesthat Commission aproval of File No. SR-NASD-88-19, as hereby amended, wouldbe consistent with the public policy goals clearly evident in the languageof section 15A(b)(11). Continued availability of the Pink SheetsTM (andrelated CCH/NQB information services) coupled with the coordination ofCCH/NQB and NASD efforts respecting market makers' compliance with Rule15c2-11 will ensure the integrity of quotes originated by Market MakerParticipants in the Service. The regulatory experience gained from theNASD's operation of the pilot Service will form a sound foundation forfuture system enhancements should the Service become permanent.In sum, the NASD's arrangement with CCH/NQB provides an operational ``safetynet'' to ensure the availability of a recognized quotation medium for BulletinBoard Securities and certain ancillary services during the Service's pilotphase. This result is consistent with the concepts of investor protectionand maintenance of fair and orderly OTC markets that underlie the NASD'sstatus as a self-regulatory organization.Accordingly, the NASD believes that ample statutory bases exist for theCommission's approval of File No. SR-NASD-88-19 as hereby amended.B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on CompetitionAs noted earlier, the design and operational features of the Bulletin BoardService are not being modified by Amendment No. 2 to File No. SR-NASD-88-19.Accordingly, the NASD hereby reiterates its previous analysis of competitivequestions under Item 4 of its original filing on the Service.The NASD posits that the amended terms for the pilot operation of the BulletinBoard Service will not constitute an undue burden upon Market Maker Participants.Several factors support this proposition. First, the NASDAQ terminal population,unlike independent vendors' systems for Level 1 information, will not providebroad-based dissemination of Bulletin Board Information to registered representativesand retail customers. Consequently, continuance of CCH/NQB's Pink SheetsTMmedium is a logical and necessary adjunct to the Service. Second, marketmaker participation in the Service is entirely voluntary. A Participantmay expand or contract such participation based upon business considerations.Third, to the extent that a firm already maintains Pink SheetsTM listingsfor Bulletin Board Securities and substitutes the Service, it will incurno added charge for displaying priced quotations in both mediums. Fourth,by the conclusion of the pilot program, the NASD will have formulated cost-basedcharges for members' access to the Service through NASDAQ equipment. Duringthe Service's pilot term, the NASD will work with private vendors who maybe interested in supplying components of the Service's data base to subscribersof their real-time data services. This cooperative undertaking will encompassdefinition of the information to be furnished and the corresponding accessterms and cost-based charges. These matters will be addressed in a separateRule 19b-4 filing to gain permanent status for the Service.Promoting continuance of the Pink SheetsTM as a quotation medium mightbe perceived as an action that disadvantages other vendors that publishstatic quotation information on OTC securities. During the pilot term,the NASD is prepared to provide static transmissions to other interestedvendors that produce publications comparable to CCH/NQB's Pink SheetsTMon substantially the same terms as provided for in the CCH/NQB_NASD agreement.To date, no other vendor has expressed an interest in receiving statictransmissions of data from the Service's data base.Finally, the existence of the CCH/NQB_NASD agreement does not pose a competitiveburden to vendors that customarily offer on-line access to current OTCmarket information during business hours. As stated earlier, only NASDmembers with NASDAQ equipment will have real-time access to the Service'sdata base during the pilot term. However, the NASD has committed to workwith interested vendors during that period to develop appropriate accessterms and cost-based fees. Those access terms/fees will be submitted forCommission approval in conjunction with another Rule 19b-4 filing to gainpermanent status for the Service. Therefore, assuming that the pilot issuccessful, all vendors of screen-based services will be on an equal footingwith respect to marketing components of the Service's data base. The existenceof the CCH/NQB_NASD agreement does not alter the NASD's stated approachin File No. SR-NASD-88-19 toward distribution of Bulletin Board data tothe vendor community.C.
