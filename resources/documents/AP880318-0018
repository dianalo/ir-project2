But as officials were briefing about 25 journalists at amilitary base, two unidentified jet planes from Honduras roaredinto Nicaraguan territory and dropped bombs along the border.   The reporters dived into the dirt for cover. No one was hurt.   Some military officials in Nicaragua described the planes asFrench-made Mysteres, while others said they were U.S.-made F-5s.The Honduran air force has both.   The bombs landed along the Coco River, which marks the borderbetween the two countries. Puffs of black smoke curled over thebanana trees.   Lt. Col. Javier Carrion, the deputy chief of the Sandinistaarmy's general staff, said two bombs landed in Nicaraguan territoryand one in Honduras.   The journalists' briefing came after Reagan administrationofficials had claimed that Nicaraguan troops had penetratedHonduran territory in pursuit of the U.S.-backed rebels. Nicaraguaand Honduras share a long, ill defined border.   As the jets roared in Thursday, drowning out the lapping of theslow-moving river and the chirping of crickets, journalists andsoldiers threw themselves against the earth.   Some of the bombs exploded about 70 yards away from where theylay.   Maj. Rosa Pasos, the Defense Ministry spokeswoman, lost hereyeglasses in the weeds but quickly found them. She wore anAmerican-made uniform that had apparently been taken from a Contrarebel.   The Sandinistas opened fire at the planes with anti-aircraftguns. They apparently didn't hit either of them.   None of the five Soviet-made helicopters used in this area 175miles from Managua was hit. In Washington, sources who spoke oncondition of anonymity claimed that one Soviet-made helicopter onthe ground had been damaged. The Soviet Union supplies theSandinistas with military hardware and training.   Carrion, who had been conducting the offensive against theContras, said that jets had buzzed the Coco River earlier in theday.   Asked whether Sandinista troops had crossed the border in theiroffensive, Carrion replied, ``Well, no.''   ``There are sectors in the mountains here where you can getlost. It's easy to confuse the topography.''   However, Carrion displayed a map showing where Sandinista troopshad destroyed Contra camps along a six-mile route on both sides ofthe Coco River.   Thursday's attack came hours after 3,200 American troops arrivedin Honduras in a show of force.   Nicaraguan officers said the air attack appeared to be aimed atharassing the Sandinistas.</TEXT></DOC>
