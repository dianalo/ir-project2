The alliance urged workers to continue a general strike untilthey achieved their goal of democracy. The strike began Sept. 18when Gen. Saw Maung seized power in a military coup.   In another development, the government said today that 348people had been killed in Burma since the coup. Western diplomatsin Rangoon estimated earlier that as many as 400 people were killedby the government in the days following the coup.   Government spokesman Kyaw Sann told a press briefing that 219others had been wounded and 1,107 arrested by authorities.   Widespread rioting broke out when Saw Maung seized power, andthe general immediately ordered troops into the streets to quellthe protests.   The government spokesman also said rebels of the Burma CommunistParty have launched major attacks against army outposts innortheastern Burma, killing 44 government soldiers and wounding 92.The fighting, said to be continuing in some areas, involved bothgovernment air strikes and fierce infantry clashes with bayonets.   The spokesman for the opposition alliance said another formermilitary officer, Tin Oo, was named vice chairman of the League forDemocracy while Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of a revered Burmeseindependence hero, was chosen general secretary.   The three figures formed the league Saturday and immediatelycalled on all citizens to join in a peaceful struggle against thenew military regime.   The alliance marks the first formal opposition attempt to unifyunder one leadership the millions of students, Buddhist monks,workers and professionals who have taken to the streets over thepast two months to demand an end to 26 years of repressiveone-party rule.   The new opposition league demands than an interim government becreated to lead Burma out of chaos.   ``We still believe that an interim government is the only way tosolve the present crisis in the country ... to revive stalledgovernment, to reactivate the broken-down economy and to holdgenuine, free and fair general elections,'' Aung Gyi said today.   The alliance also named nine members of a 12-member executivecommittee. The three remaining positions are to be filled later byrepresentatives of Burma's numerous ethnic minorities, who are alsofighting the government.   The alliance later will elect a 37-member governing body, whichwill include one representative from each of the seven states whereethnic minorities predominate _ Arakan, Chin, Kachin, Shan, Kayah,Karen and Mon.   The 70-year-old Aung Gyi earlier this year circulated a seriesof letters to former leader Ne Win, criticizing the government'seconomic performance and its brutal suppression of studentdemonstrations last March.   Aung Gyi, who broke with Ne Win in 1963 over economic policy,was jailed for several years in the 1960s and again briefly thissummer when hardliner Sein Lwin assumed power after Ne Win resigned.   Tin Oo, 61, was removed by Ne Win as defense and army chief in1976 and was later jailed in connection with an allegedanti-government plot.   Aung San Suu Kyi, 42, is the daughter of the late Aung San, themuch revered hero of Burmese independence from Great Britain. Shehad been living in Britain but returned to Rangoon for a visitearlier this year and stayed to campaign for democracy.   Analysts say the three, who had trouble cooperating in the past,were pressed to unite by the bloody crackdown on dissent followingSaw Maung's coup.   Since the coup, demonstrations have ceased in Rangoon and somestudents have fled to the rugged frontier with Thailand to seekrefuge with ethnic minority insurgents.   On Monday, top officials appealed to parents and teachers tostop the students from linking up with the rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
