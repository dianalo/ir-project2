(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>African Nations Emphasizing SecurityandM;Many African leaders have recognized the important role an indigenousinformation technology industry can play in rapidly bringing their nations tothe forefront of the community of industrialized countries.andP;  President AbdouDiouf of Senegal, for instance, has said that information technology andtelecommunications can provide &quot;a degree of national security&quot; for developingcountries.andM;The information technology industry in several nations is burgeoning.andP;  Andmany African governments now realize that a well-defined computer securitypolicy is critical to protecting their information resources.andP;  Many are,therefore, considering implementing computer crime legislation.andM;However, concerns about computer security in most African nations have laggedbehind the rapid pace of computerization largely because of the legal legacyleft behind by the former colonial rulers, most notably the British.andM;In the U.K.andP;  a computer hacker, for example, may be held liable only forcivil rather than criminal charges because hacking is considered no more anuisance than trespassing on a person's private property.andP;  The only criminalcharge that can be contemplated against a hacker in Britain is violation ofthe Theft Act of 1968, which would entail the theft of the computer owner'selectricity.andM;Unfortunately, this British legal interpretation of computer crime alsopermeates the legal systems of its former African colonies.andP;  Kenya, Nigeriaand Zimbabwe, for instance, have relatively advanced computer infrastructuresin the press, financial sector and some government ministries.andP;  Under thelaws they inherited from Britain, however, it is nearly impossible tosuccessfully prosecute computer criminals in those nations.andM;Away From British RuleandM;But many African nations have become aware that, as their independenteconomies mature, their computer security procedures should also.andP;  Somenations have thrown their support behind the most recent effort to passUnited Nations General Assembly Guidelines on Data Protection.andP;  These Africanstates, most notably Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast and Senegal, aresponsoring the current guidelines, which have been submitted to the UNGeneral Assembly by a group of international data protection commissionerswho met in Berlin last year.andP;  The General Assembly is expected to vote onthese guidelines during its 1990 session in September.andM;These same five nations were also at the forefront of earlier GeneralAssembly Resolutions Nos.andP;  164 (1985) and 162 (1987) concerning policies onthe international use of information resources and the transborder flow ofdata important to a particular nation.andM;This flow of data to other countries is viewed by most of these nations asone of their most important security concerns.andP;  As far back as 1985,government officials from several African countries met in the Ivory Coastcapital of Yamoussoukro to discuss, among other items, the &quot;informaticsassault&quot; by technologically advanced countries on the databases of developingcountries.andP;  The resulting African Declaration of Yamoussoukro stated thatinformation technology, when properly harnessed, creates opportunities fortraining and industrialization, while ensuring the sovereignty of developingcountries.andM;Therefore, these nations do not relish the idea of having industrializedcountries indiscriminately browsing through and capturing data from theirgovernment databases.andP;  Many UN agencies, such as the International MonetaryFund, the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the World Bank, the WorldHealth Organization and the United Nations Industrial DevelopmentOrganization (UNIDO) require information from these databases on a regularbasis in order to carry out their charter.andM;To prevent indiscriminate database access, user identification codes (UICs)and passwords were initiated for a recent information exchange projectbetween the United Nations and Ghana.andP;  For this project, the UN installedmodems on Ghanaian government computers to upload information from GhanaianTechnology Transfer Center (TTC) databases to United Nations computers in NewYork.andP;  The data are collected by the TTC from several government ministriesand agencies and include information on food and technology, as well asindustrial and energy policies.andP;  UN data centers in Geneva, N.Y., andWashington, D.C., and not the TTC, however, determine what government dataare finally released.andM;The government of Ghana says it is satisfied with the security provided bythe UICs and passwords.andP;  It also receives UN agency revenues, such as WorldBank loans and FAO grants, as a result of providing such information.andO;Regardless, other Ghanaians in academia, government and the press oppose anyuse of government data outside the country.andP;  They do not believe that thefinancial assistance provided by the UN justifies the loss of sovereigntyposed by unregulated transborder data flow.andM;Within each African nation, experts agree, the computer-hacking problemsplaguing industrialized countries will become significant unless effectivecomputer security controls are identified and installed.andP;  The first task,however, is to educate the various populaces about these concerns, a taskthat could prove time consuming.andP;  Benin Foreign Minister Frederico Affo saidas early as 1985 that &quot;sensitizing African leaders and African public opinion[to the importance of computer security] could be, in our opinion .andP;  .  .  anunforeseen requisite.&quot;andM;Antihacker LawandM;Ghana has taken a bold step toward meeting this requisite by considering aComputer Crime Law, the first of its kind in Africa.andM;The first effort to establish a national information technology managementpolicy for Ghana was part of the 1976 Supreme Military Council Directive(SMCD) No.andP;  19.andP;  This directive, issued by the military government of FlightLieutenant Jerry Rawlings, stipulated that a National Data Production ControlBoard be established to manage information technology in Ghana.andP;  The board'sprimary objective has been to determine the type of government data thatshould be automated and what access authorizations should be granted tovarious users.andP;  It is, however, only an advisory body with no legal power toenforce computer security, a deficiency that will be redressed by the newComputer Crime Law.andM;Ghana expects the law to be enacted before the middle of this year.andP;  TheGhana Law Reform Commission proposed the law in view of the rapid increase inthe use of computers in government, banking, commerce, utilities,telecommunications and law enforcement.andP;  According to Yaw Adjei, a spokesmanfor the Ghanaian Embassy in Washington, D.C., the government encouraged theLaw Reform Commission to come up with a policy and considers the resultingproposed law significant.andM;The proposed Ghanaian law addresses the problems of unauthorized alternationand copying of data for personal gain, theft of computer media, computerhacking, eavesdropping and sabotage, as well as the unauthorized use ofcomputer systems.andP;  A person found guilty of a computer crime could face ajail term of up to 10 years and an unlimited fine.andM;Establishing a national computer security policy is critical in light ofGhana's desire to develop a local software industry.andP;  In the absence ofwell-established computer security laws, Ghana's fledgling software industrywould be vulnerable to rampant theft of code as well as to the introductionof destructive, malicious programs such as computer viruses.andM;Recent Cairo newspaper reports about the arrival of viral-infected softwareat various Egyptian ministries have heightened concerns about the securitysurrounding Egypt's computer systems.andP;  Rightly so.andP;  A government mandate inEgypt, the 1981 Presidential Decree 627 signed by the late President AnwarSadat, spurred computer use in both government offices and publiccorporations.andM;Damming Security Leaks in EgyptandM;In some cases, the reports say, the contaminated programs have been trackedto Western Europe.andP;  To address the problem, the government has established aspecial center to check every disk sent from abroad for the presence ofviruses.andP;  Private citizens who are suspicious of software are being urged bythe government to have the center check for the presence of malicious code.andM;Security issues are all the more important in Egypt because of thecomputerization of judicial records and the assignation of national identitynumbers to some 30 million Egyptian citizens.andP;  Volumes of judicial recordsconcerning current caseloads and past case files are being automated in bothCairo and Alexandria, and in the next two years Egyptian courts in othercities are expected to become automated, as well.andP;  The government'sintroduction of national identity numbers is expected to take some threeyears.andM;According to Mahmoud Gaafar, a spokesman for the Egyptian embassy inWashington, D.C., the government is well aware of the need to protect thepersonal data linked to the new numbers and to adopt a means to guard againstfraudulent use of the numbers.andP;  Without such protection, the on-linedatabases could be used to track the personal affairs of every Egyptian.andP;  Tothat end, the government expects to introduce some form of data protectionlegislation in the near future, Gaafar says.andM;Although other African governments are as concerned about security as theircompatriots, their actions so far lag behind the private sector.andP;  Tanzania isone prime example.andP;  The Tanzanian private sector, and accounting firms inparticular, is fairly advanced with regard to computer security, explainsKeith Wade, principal of the Computer Audit and Training Service (CATS) inSevenoaks, U.K., who has visited Tanzania on computer audit assistanceprojects sponsored by the Overseas Development Administration of GreatBritain.andP;  The Tanzanian government, in contrast, is only beginning toautomate some of its industrial, financial and governmental sectors.andM;&quot;The eight to nine government services that have introduced automation arefairly well behind the private sector in respect to coming to terms with theneed for computer security,&quot; says Wade.andP;  However, he says, both thegovernment and private industry &quot;are aware of where they must go with regardto computer security and audit controls.&quot;andP;  The Tanzanian government isprepared to initiate computer security controls at an early stage in anyforthcoming computer procurement and implementation programs.andM;Like Ghana, Egypt and Tanzania, many African governments are beginning torealize that security must likewise be provided for IT and telecommunicationsto achieve both national and economic security.andP;  Evidence of this can be seenin the fact that Botswana and Namibia for the first time signed up to attendthe International Federation of Information Processing Society's (IFIPS)International Conference on Information Security, which will be held in Mayin Helsinki, Finland.andM;Wayne Madsen is president of Information Security Engineering Inc. ofAlexandria, Va., and a freelance writer who focuses on computer securityissues.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
