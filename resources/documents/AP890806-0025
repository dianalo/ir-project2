(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An estranged couple's fight over thefate of seven fertilized human eggs goes to court Monday and mayprovide a legal precedent in cases where technology has bent thetraditional course of parenthood.   Junior Lewis Davis is seeking to prevent his wife, Mary SueDavis, from attempting to become pregnant with any of the eggs nowthat they are getting divorced. Davis, who filed for divorce inFebruary, says he no longer wants to have a child with her.   The eggs were taken from Mrs. Davis and fertilized with Davis'sperm in an in-vitro fertilization program the couple entered at aKnoxville hospital six years ago in hopes of having a so-called``test-tube baby.''   ``I consider them life,'' Mrs. Davis, 28, said shortly after herhusband filed for divorce. She has said that the eggs are theresult of years of surgery, tests and self-administered injectionsand are her best chance at having a child. ``I would love to be amother,'' she said.   She also said she would consider raising the child by herselfand not asking for child support.   Davis, 30, countered at the time that it would be unsettling``to know that ... 10 years from now I could be walking down thestreet and bump into my child and not know it.''   In-vitro fertilization was first used successfully in 1978 withthe birth in England of Louise Brown. Eggs are surgically removedfrom a woman's ovary and combined with sperm in the laboratory. Theresulting fertilized egg is then implanted in the woman's uterus inhopes a normal pregnancy will result; other fertilized eggs can befrozen for later attempts.   Mrs. Davis says she had five tubal pregnancies after the couplewas married in 1979, one resulting in a ruptured fallopian tube.Surgery was done to tie the other tube before the Davises enteredthe in-vitro program administered by Dr. I. Ray King.   There were originally nine fertilized eggs; two wereunsuccessfully implanted before the couple's marriage broke down.   The Davises did not sign a contract specifying what should bedone with the embryos if circumstances changed such as a divorce,or the death of one or both of them. King says that was anoversight, but he added that any such agreement probably could becontested in court anyway.   But the lack of a contract leaves Blount County District CourtJudge W. Dale Young with no prior agreement on which to base hisdecision, and with little legal guidance. Attorneys for bothparties said in briefs there was no legal precedent they could citeto help guide Young's decision.   ``There is no legal precedent that says very early embryos arelegal persons with rights,'' said John A. Robertson, a lawprofessor at the University of Texas. ``The state (of Tennessee)could choose to protect them if it wished, but the state hasn'tdone that.''   The only state to take such action is believed to be Louisiana,which has a law saying embryos are entitled to the full protectionof the law and cannot be owned or destroyed.   In the Tennessee case, Charles Clifford, Davis' attorney, arguesthat the embryos are joint property and can be disposed of likeother assets in a divorce. Giving Mrs. Davis sole discretion overthe embryos would deprive Davis of the right to decide whether tosire offspring, the lawyer argued.   Jay Christenberry, attorney for Mrs. Davis, argues that Davis istrying to reverse a condition as old as Adam and Eve _ it hasnever, he says, been within the man's power to cancel a pregnancyonce an egg has been fertilized.   These embryos are in cold storage, not in Mrs. Davis' body. Buteven in so primitive a form, with only four to eight cells, theyrepresent potential life, Mrs. Davis' attorney said.   Robertson, who has written articles on the legal and ethicalaspects of in-vitro fertilization and the rights of embryos, isexpected to be called as a witness by Davis' attorney. He arguesthat the case should be decided in favor of the person who would behurt worse by losing, which he says is Davis.   ``It would seem that the party who wished to avoid parenthoodwould be hurt worse if the embryos were used,'' he said. ``Theother parent can go out and create new embryo and try to havechildren.''   However, Mrs. Davis' chances of trying further in-vitrofertilization could depend on her remarrying. Chicago attorney LoriB. Andrews, a specialist in reproductive technology law, said sheknows of no in-vitro fertilization clinic that will take a singlewoman as a patient.</TEXT></DOC>
