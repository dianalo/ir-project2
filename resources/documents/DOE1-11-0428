Basic assessment factors werethe angle of internal friction and humidity which determine displacementcharacteristics of rock during mining and formation of waste dumps. Providesregression equations for determining values of humidity and internalfriction angle in overburden rock. The method proposed can successfullybe used in other surface mines.</TEXT></DOC>
