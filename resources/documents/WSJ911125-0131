When the proposed merger was first announced in September,Coca-Cola Enterprises said it would issue 30 million commonshares to acquire closely held Johnston Coca-Cola BottlingGroup Inc. in Chattanooga, Tenn. At the time, those sharescarried an indicated value of about $450 million.</LP><TEXT>   Friday, however, Coca-Cola Enterprises said it would pay acombination of cash and stock. The mix will be determined bythe value of Coca-Cola Enterprises' stock at the time of themerger. At Friday's closing price of $13.125 a share, forinstance, the company would issue about 14 million to 15million shares and pay the rest in cash, with the transactionhaving an indicated value of about $370 million.   Coca-Cola Enterprises said the total value of the mergerwill be equivalent to 28.75 million shares at the time thetransaction is completed.   A company spokesman said the new terms represent a bettervalue for shareholders of Coca-Cola Enterprises, noting thatthe original proposal was put forth by Johnston.   Analysts suggested that sagging volume and sales in thesoft-drink industry spurred the drop in price. It is &quot;astatement that business conditions are a lot worse than theywere a few months ago,&quot; said David Goldman, an Oppenheimer andamp;Co. analyst.   However, a company spokesman disputed that reasoning. &quot;Thevalue of bottling operations do not fluctuate with volumeovernight,&quot; he said.   All Johnston shareholders will be able to receive cash fortheir shares, up to half of the merger value. The largestholder, the Johnston family, will take Coca-Cola Enterprisesstock for its 47% stake, but the other two largest holderswill take cash. PruSupply Capital Asset Inc., an investmentarm for Prudential Insurance Co. of America, will receivecash for all of its 33% share in Johnston. Prudentialofficials weren't available for comment. Coca-Cola Co., whichowns 20% of Johnston and would own 44% of the combinedcompanies, will receive cash for most of its Johnston shares.A Coca-Cola spokeswoman said the company wouldn't comment onthe merger until the Coca-Cola Enterprises board meets toconsider these recommendations.
