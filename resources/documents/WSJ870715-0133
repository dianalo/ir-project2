The bank and financial-services holding company said that despite the special allowance of about 22 cents a share, however, six-month results likely were comparable to those in the similar period last year. Earnings will be released later this week, the company said.    In the six months ended June 30, 1986, KeyCorp's net income was $37.8 million, or $1.38 a share; in this year's first quarter, the company had net of $22.5 million, or 75 cents a share.    The three suits include a $15 million federal jury verdict awarded to a businessman who lost his credit line after a KeyCorp unit received erroneous information linking him to organized crime. With accumulated interest, the award totals $21 million. The company is appealing the verdict. The other suits, also filed against KeyCorp units, led to small settlements, the company said.    Victor J. Riley Jr., president and chief executive officer, said a settlement appears likely in the largest case, adding, &quot;Prudence dictates that we get these costs behind us right away.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, KeyCorp stock closed at $26.625, down 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
