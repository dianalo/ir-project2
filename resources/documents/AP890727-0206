The convictions of seven officers and the possibility of moretrials led to three barracks revolts against Alfonsin, who leftoffice on July 8 following his defeat in the May presidentialelection.   Menem repeatedly has said he will resolve the impasse with themilitary, although he has refused to say how or when. His advisershave said the government was leaning toward forgiving soldiersinvolved in the human rights abuses and the uprisings.   On Wednesday, Defense Minister Italo Luder confirmed thatauthorities had dropped disciplinary proceedings against severalhundred soldiers who took part in army insurrections in April 1987and in January and December 1988.   ``Lower-ranking officers were given minor sanctions and sentback to their units,'' Luder said. He did not specify what thepenalties were.   ``The objectives of these acts of indiscipline were shared byall the armed forces,'' Luder said. The comment suggested that thegovernment believes reconciliation with the armed forces would bedifficult if the officers were punished.   No one has been tried in the revolts. However, uprising leadersLt. Col. Aldo Rico and Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin and six otherofficers have been in military prison since the revolts were putdown by negotiation. They caused little bloodshed.   Menem's comments Thursday were to several local reporters heinvited to breakfast at Government House. They were reported by theindependent news agency Noticias Argentinas.   Menem has three main choices in the case of officers chargedwith human rights abuses: a presidential pardon, a congressionalamnesty or to move ahead with the trials of 15 generals and threeadmirals that have been deferred for months. He has never spoken infavor of the last option, but has not said he ruled it out.   The issue bedeviled the government of Alfonsin, who was electedin October 1983 to replace a military dictatorship.   Rico's insurrections, in April 1987 and January 1988, were aimedat ending the civilian trials of officers accused of human rightsabuses during the 1976-83 military dictatorship's crackdown onleftist subversion. About 8,900 people who disappeared during theperiod are presumed dead.   In June 1987, the Alfonsin government passed a law thatsheltered from prosecution all but the highest officers accused ofhuman rights abuses.   Seineldin led a rebellion in December 1988 that he said wascarried out to draw attention to soldiers' low pay and poorequipment. The issue of trying officers also played a role, however.</TEXT></DOC>
