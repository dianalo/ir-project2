(800) 548-1993andM;List Price: With 1MB RAM, 1.2MB 5-1/4-inch and 1.44MB 3-1/4-inch floppy diskdrives, 68MB hard disk, monochrome monitor, DOS 4.01, $2,399; with VGAmonitor, $3,024; with 155MB hard disk, $3,924.andM;In Short: Northgate answers the need for speed with innovative design andpacks it into a solid, traditional AT-style case.andP;  Fast video, superiorsupport, and a fair price combine to make this machine a prime choice.andM;Northgate wants to change some of the ideas you have about high-performancecomputers.andP;  According to the Northgate philosophy, for instance, theperformance panacea of shadow RAM is hot air rather than hot stuff.andP;  And,true to promise, the SuperMicro 286/20 brings these renegade viewpoints tolife with surprising results.andM;Without shadowing, the SuperMicro 286/20 delivers better video performancethan do many systems with it.andP;  Although the 286/20 lags on some choresbecause of its enforced one-wait-state operation, it handles integer additionand multiplication as fast as do near-zero-wait-state machines.andP;  And theprice is competitive: a system with Hercules-compatible monochrome display,65MB hard disk, DOS 4.01, and Super PC-Kwik disk caching software lists at$2,399.andM;Physically patterned almost exactly after the original AT, the SuperMicro286/20 is the same size and shape; the only departure is the three openingsfor disk drives on the right-hand side of the box.andM;A more-important difference is the three connectors poking out of the fivespaces on the rear panel.andP;  Two are 9-pin male D-shell serial ports and one isa 25-pin female parallel port.andP;  The circuitry for these ports is built intothe Northgate system board as standard equipment.andP;  Monochrome systems benefitfrom a second parallel port on the display adapter.andM;The chassis itself is built from a somewhat heavier-gauge steel than most ATclones, and the result is a physically sturdier computer.andP;  Drives mount witha proprietary rail system similar to that of the AT, but the rails areslimmer and made of steel.andP;  The internal full-height drive bay is configuredto handle two half-height devices.andM;SYSTEM BOARDandM;The heart of the system board is a Harris 80C286 processor rated andoperating at a full 20 MHz.andP;  A front-panel switch cuts the speed down to 8MHz for software compatibility.andM;Northgate sees the ubiquitous Chips and Technologies chip set as being almostthe devil's work.andP;  Consequently, the SuperMicro 286/20 is built from discretecircuits and two VLSI Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) thatwork together to achieve performance enhancements.andP;  For other companies, thedownside of this design is the lack of the chip set's shadow RAM, butNorthgate considers that an advantage.andM;The system board reserves a socket for an 80287 numeric coprocessor withspeed ratings of 7, 10, or 14 MHz accommodated by jumper settings.andP;  Expansionslots operate at 8 MHz.andM;Special double-pinned sockets accommodate either 256-kilobit or 1-megabitmemory chips in one or two 18-chip banks, endowing the SuperMicro 286/20 withup to 4MB on the system board.andP;  One megabyte is standard.andP;  A proprietarymemory expansion connector allows the addition of even more RAM running atfull microprocessor speed, up to the system's 16MB addressing capacity.andP;  Allchips in the evaluation machine were rated at 80 nanoseconds--not up to thetask of complete zero-wait-state operation--hence the unvarying one waitstate.andM;Because shadow RAM is lacking, more of the memory of the SuperMicro 286/20 isavailable for other uses.andP;  The 2MB in the evaluation machine were configuredwith 640K for DOS, 1,408K in the extended addressing area.andP;  Northgatesupplies a disk caching program to put the extended memory to work.andM;EXPANSION SLOTSandM;Only six expansion slots are available: one 8-bit, four 16-bit, and theproprietary memory slot (which can also serve as an 8-bit expansion slot).andO;There doesn't seem to be any reason for the shortage of slots; the case ofthe SuperMicro 286/20 is designed to accommodate eight slots (eight retainingbrackets are available), and adequate room is available inside for the fullcomplement of slots.andM;Two 16-bit slots were filled in the evaluation unit: one with a 16-bit VideoSeven VGA adapter, the other with an Adaptec ACB-2232 floppy/hard diskcontroller upgrade.andP;  The standard controller is an Adaptec 2372B.andM;Mass storage in the evaluation system included the two standard-equipmenthigh-density Newtronics floppy disk drives, one 1.2MB 5-1/4-inch and one1.44MB 3-1/2-inch.andP;  An optional fast (18-millisecond average access time)ESDI Miniscribe 3180 hard disk added 155MB of mass storage to the system, anupgrade that costs $695.andM;The system clock, CMOS setup memory, and lithium power (good for 10 years)are combined into a single module that's soldered to the system board.andP;  The220-watt Power Tronic power supply has four drive connectors and accommodatesboth 115- and 230-volt operation, selected with a rear-panel DIP switch, at50 or 60 Hz.andP;  A switched power jack is available for connecting a display.andM;CONSTRUCTIONandM;Overall construction of the SuperMicro 286/20 is ver ygood, although leaddress inside the machine is somewhat sloppy.andP;  On the other hand, thedocumentation is terrific, designed to ease new users into PC-dom whileincluding adequate reference material for more-experienced users.andP;  Inaddition, Northgate supplies an on-line user's guide with hypertext-likereference abilities and offers a 1-year warranty backed by an overnightreplacement program and on-site service (from Sorbus for business usersonly).andM;For writers and others who depend on keystrokes for their livelihood, theNorthgate Omni Key/102 keyboard will be a blessing.andP;  A 102-key cross betweenIBM's AT and Enhanced-style keyboard designs (left-hand function keys, largeEnter Key, but separate cursor and numeric/cursor keypads), the Omni Key hasthe same solid tactile feel and click of an IBM keyboard.andM;The standard-equipment display is a 14-inch flat-screen amber digitalmonitor.andP;  The evaluation system included an optional Imtec 1455 multiscanningcolor 14-inch VGA display, a $745 upgrade (including adapter).andM;Although the SuperMicro 286/20 comes up two slots shy and has one wait statetoo many, it vindicates itself with its wealth of standard equipment, makingit a good buy in this performance category.andP;  And it may just change your mindabout the need for shadow RAM.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
