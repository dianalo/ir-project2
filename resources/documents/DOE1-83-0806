<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-83-0806 </DOCNO><TEXT>In recent years, there has been a significant increase in Australia inthe use of partial extraction mining methods for the purpose of controllingsurface subsidence. There is an increasing tendency to base the designof these methods primarily on surface subsidence measurements and observations.This approach does not ensure regional mine stability nor longterm surfacesubsidence control. In this paper, a number of basic rock mechanics principleswhich govern mine stability and thus subsidence control, are presentedand illustrated with examples. It is concluded that there is a need toidentify fundamental mechanisms of local strata behaviour to complimentsubsidence observations and ensure the permanent stability of partialextraction workings. 25 refs., 30 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
