The agreement, reached in November 1988 andalready extended once, was to have expired next Sunday.</LP><TEXT>   In a revision to the original pact, Southern CaliforniaEdison also agreed to pay San Diego Gas $15 million for itsmerger-related expenses if the transaction isn't completed.Both companies said the payment wouldn't be paid if San DiegoGas backed out. Both companies said that is unlikely.   The original agreement provided for as much as $15 millionof expense reimbursements and a $25 million termination feeto be paid by Southern California Edison to San Diego Gas ifthe merger wasn't completed. The revised agreement eliminatesthe termination fee along with most of the previousconditions for payment of the expense reimbursement.   Prospective anti-competitive effects are considered apotential stumbling block to regulatory clearance of themerger, a transaction that would create the nation's largestinvestor-owned utility.   On Feb. 1, administrative law judges recommended that theCalifornia Public Utlities Commission reject the proposedmerger. A decision by the full commission is expected nextmonth. A decision also is pending at the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission.</TEXT></DOC>
