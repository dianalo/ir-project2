Paffenbarger Jr. of Stanford University, seniorauthor of the study.;    Paffenbarger said that while the researchers studiedonly men, the findings probably apply to women.;    Physicians routinely urgediabetics to watch their diets, lose weight and exercise. But researchers saidthe latest findings are the first to suggest that physical activity alsoprevents diabetes from occurring.;    The researchers said exercise should berecommended for those at high risk of diabetes, just as it is for people whoare susceptible to heart disease.;    &quot;It's another disease in which exerciseis clearly beneficial,&quot; said Dr. Susan P. Helmrich of the University ofCalifornia, Berkeley, who directed the study.;    The research was publishedin today's New England Journal of Medicine. Among the study's findings:;   (check) Men who benefited most from exercise were those already at high riskof diabetes because they were overweight, had high blood pressure or had afamily history of the disease.;    (check) Moderately vigorous activityprovided more protection than light exercise.;    (check) Men who were alreadyat low risk of diabetes did not reduce their risk further by exercising.;   The study was based on a follow-up of 5,990 men who graduated from theUniversity of Pennsylvania in the 1930s and 1940s. They answered detailedquestionnaires about their health and living habits in 1962 and 1975. Duringthis time, 202 developed diabetes.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910718  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  314  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday July 18, 199100200241,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
