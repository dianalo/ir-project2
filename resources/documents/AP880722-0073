Suarez Gomez, accused of peddling cocaine by the ton through avast global network, was behind bars today after police trudgedthrough a jungle to one of his five ranches and arrested him as heslept.   ``President Victor Paz Estenssoro says he is very pleased withSuarez Gomez's arrest and that the fight against drugs is the toppriority of the government,'' Interior Minister Juan Carlos Duransaid told reporters Thursday.   Duran said Bolivia will not extradite Suarez Gomez to the UnitedStates because he was sentenced to 15 years in Bolivia this year.But U.S. officials said they still will seek to have him brought totrial in the United States.   The arrest of the debonair 56-year-old Suarez Gomez, who alsohas been accused of helping finance the bloody military coup thatoverthrew the civilian government in 1980, was greeted withjubilation.   ``He's the biggest cocaine producer in the world. He hasenormous acreage in coca plants,'' said Chief Assistant U.S.Attorney Richard Gregorie in Miami.   Suarez Gomez was captured Wednesday by 10 narcotics officers whotrooped through tropical jungles all night and raided his El Sujoranch at dawn, Duran said. Two bodyguards also were arrested and 20automatic weapons were seized.   Suarez Gomez was flown to La Paz from Trinidad city, Duran said.El Sujo, about 25 miles from Trinidad, is one of Suarez Gomez'sfive ranches in the heart of the tropical Beni region in northeastBolivia.   Until now, Suarez Gomez has used his money and influence to buyhis freedom in Bolivia. He publicly spoke of paying off politicalfigures and policemen.   Suarez Gomez was tried in absentia in Bolivia this year on drugtrafficking charges and was sentenced to 15 years.   Duran said Bolivia has no extradition treaty with the UnitedStates, but U.S. drug officials said they would seek to try SuarezGomez on trafficking charges in the United States regardless.   Gregorie said Thursday that an extradition request would beentered immediately.   U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Jack Hook said inMiami that Suarez Gomez was indicted in Miami in 1980 forconspiracy to peddle 854 pounds of cocaine, but that Suarez Gomezcommonly deals in tons of cocaine.   Hook noted that Carlos Lehder Rivas, leader of a group of drugkingpins known as the Medellin Cartel, was sentenced inJacksonville, Fla., on Wednesday to life in prison without parole.   ``I think the Carlos Lehder case goes to show countries that ifthey arrest traffickers, here (in the United States) there arejails that can hold them, there are courts that will try them andmost definitely will sentence them,'' he said.   Suarez Gomez's son, Roberto Suarez Levy, was extradited fromSwitzerland to Miami in 1981 on drug trafficking charges. He wasfound innocent and after his release from a Miami jail was welcomedas a hero in Bolivia.   While independent of the Medellin Cartel, Suarez Gomez allegedlyassociated with the Colombia-based organization on someenterprises, said Hook. But his own smuggling ring wasself-contained.   ``His operations consist of growing coca leaf, manufacturingcocaine and shipping it to the United States,'' said Hook.   ``He could be considered one of the pioneers involved ingrowing, manufacturing and trafficking cocaine to the UnitedStates,'' he said.   The DEA says Suarez Gomez operated from one of his ranches.Planes would fly cocaine paste from the Chapare region to the southfor processing at his labs before shipment to Colombia, the U.S.drug agency alleges.   In 1980, the Bolivan Human Rights Association says, Suarez Gomezhelped finance the military coup that overthrew the civiliangovernment of Lidia Gueiler Tejada, the interim president, andinstalled a government that hired Italian, German and Argentinemercenaries to undertake a campaign of terror.   Under that right-wing government, headed by Gen. Luis GarciaMeza, drug traffickers operated with impunity and left-wingpolitical figures and labor leaders were killed, tortured or exiled.   The mercenaries went after opposition figures and providedprotection to traffickers. Human rights activists said Suarez Gomezwas the main player on behalf of cocaine traffickers.   Estenssoro was elected in 1985, and the civilian government hasbeen tougher on drug trafficking than previous regimes. Last month,the lower house of Bolivia's Congress accused cocaine kingpins oftrying to take over the government and called for a united front topreserve democracy.</TEXT></DOC>
