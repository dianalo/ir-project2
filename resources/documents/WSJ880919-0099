Yet they're pouring money into an investment that acts like a mutual fund and trades like a stock.    The closed-end fund, as it is called, is enjoying record popularity. This year 41 have been launched, raising more than $14 billion, which is more than the record $11 billion for all of last year.    Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co., in a report on retail brokers, calls closed-end funds &quot;the retail product of 1988.&quot; The New York investment firm says their popularity should last &quot;until interest rates rise far enough and ownership is broad enough to create widespread bad will.&quot;    That's not likely to occur this year. Michael Goldstein, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, recently raised his estimate for the amount expected to be invested in new closed-end funds this year to $19 billion from $15 billion.    But for many investors -- even those versed in stocks and mutual funds -- closed-end funds remain a bit of a mystery. &quot;Most people don't even know they own closed-end funds,&quot; says Steven Samuels, a partner at Drake Capital Securities Inc., a Santa Monica, Calif., brokerage firm.    Here are some questions and answers to help clear things up.    Why are they called closed-end funds?    Because they issue a fixed number of shares, then close the share-issuing process. The shares trade like stocks, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere.    How do these funds differ from ordinary mutual funds?    Mutual funds aren't traded publicly and they are open-ended. They continually issue or redeem shares according to the needs of investors. The value of an open-end fund share is determined solely by the portfolio's value.    Why are closed-end funds so popular?    For one thing, many of this year's new issues have been bond funds. The current high income offered by many of these funds appeals to some investors who have been skittish since the crash. In addition, faced with diminished sales of other products such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds, underwriters, managers and brokers are promoting closed-end funds aggressively. The $14 billion in new issues this year has generated more than $1 billion in underwriting fees.    Do closed-end funds offer any advantages over open-end funds?    Closed-end funds can operate more efficiently, because fund managers don't have to worry about having their strategies disrupted by investors pouring in cash or pulling it out. The fund managers are free to invest as they see fit, regardless of investor sentiment.    I've heard that closed-end funds can be bad deals. Why?    When investors buy closed-end funds in an initial offering, a portion of the money from the offering, typically 7%, goes to the underwriters, reducing the amount of money available for investments. And investors buying in the offering usually watch their closed-end fund fall to a discount, after briefly trading at a price above their net asset value.    Why do so many sell at a discount?    Demand for shares tends to dwindle over time. Underwriters often buy shares to help prop up the price initially. When they sell shares, the price can fall. In addition, closed-end funds are rarely promoted after their initial offering. Little information is distributed about them and few analysts cover the industry. An advocate of buying these funds in the aftermarket, Drake Capital's Mr. Samuels, calls the offering the &quot;slaughter,&quot; and the aftermarket the &quot;afterthought.&quot;    One benefit of a discount price is that investors buying a closed-end fund in the aftermarket can avoid paying the full value of a fund's portfolio as they would have to do with an open-end fund.    Do closed-end stock and bond funds trade at the same discount?    No. Closed-end stock funds tend to trade at larger discounts than bond funds. In the 10-year period through 1987, for instance, the average discount for stock funds was nearly 12%, compared with about 4% for bond funds, says Thomas J. Herzfeld, who runs a Miami investment management firm bearing his name.    Some investors seem to be willing to pay more for a fund with current high income, particularly in the shaky post-crash environment. But Mr. Herzfeld and others expect the bond-fund discounts to widen because of the glut of closed-end bond funds now on the market.    What should I look for when buying closed-end funds in the market?    Investors need to watch trends in two things: net asset value -- what the fund's securities are worth -- and the share price, which is determined by the usual market factors. A word of caution: The share price and net asset value don't always move in the same direction. And when that happens, new investors may be positioning themselves for &quot;a double gain or a double loss,&quot; says Mr. Herzfeld.    When is the best time to buy closed-end funds?    Many investors wait until a significant discount develops. To help evaluate discounts, it's important to compare funds that invest in similar types of securities. But discounts are only part of the reason to buy a particular closed-end fund. Professionals also look at the fund manager's performance; the fund's expense ratio-operating costs as a percentage of assets; the liquidity of securities in the portfolio; and the fund's liquidity on the exchange where it trades.    Are closed-end funds new?    No. In fact, they are one of the oldest forms of investment, dating back to the 1820s in Europe. They grew later in the 19th century, particularly in Britain, and were the dominant form of investment company in the U.S. until the crash of 1929. Many were leveraged, went bankrupt after the crash, and the industry fell out of favor. The past couple of years represent the first big resurgence for closed-end funds since that time. </TEXT></DOC>
