<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-14-0948 </DOCNO><TEXT>A computer code was written for calculation of the radiant heat transferin a combustion chamber of cylinder or box form, filled with an absorbingand scattering mixture of carbon dioxide, steam, soot and fuel particlesat atmospheric pressure. Calculations for turbulent flames of naturalgas without soot show good agreement with experimental data for smallflames (0.12MW). For larger flames (3MW) the differences increase. Thesedifferences can be caused by the simplified treatment of the radiationproperties of the carbon oxide and the steam. For turbulent pulverflames,the model gives values of the same order of magnitude as the experimentalresults. No evaluation of the usefulness of the model has been done,due to the lack of experimental data. The model can be generalized togeometrically complex combustion chambers with radiation properties varyingwith the wavelength. (L.E.).</TEXT></DOC>
