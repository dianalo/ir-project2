For U.S. golfers, the answer might be yes.;    TheJapanese conglomerate that bought the renowned seaside links last Septemberreportedly plans to sell private memberships for $735,000 apiece in Japan,which in effect could lead to closing off Pebble Beach to public play.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  U.S. GOLFERS MAY LOSE PEBBLE BEACHOWNERS PLAN TO SELL MEMBERSHIPS IN JAPAN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Mercury News Staff Writer Dan Hruby contributed to this report.  </MEMO><TEXT>     That's a worst-case scenario, but it apparently is one of the options opento the owner, the Ben Hogan Properties, a subsidiary of Cosmo World Corp. ofTokyo.;    Cosmo World plans to set up a joint venture in September to beginmembership sales, raising $559 million with 760 memberships, the Asahi NewsService reported Thursday in Japan. This would pay a substantial amount of thereported $900 million purchase price for the Pebble Beach Co., previouslyowned by billionaire oil mogul Marvin Davis and associates.;    The newsservice said Cosmo World had confirmed the plan, although it did not attributethe information to a source. Officials at Cosmo World's Los Angeles office andat Ben Hogan Properties in Fort Worth, Texas, could not be reached for commentby the Mercury News, and Mark Verbonich, Pebble Beach Co.'s vice president forcorporate affairs, said, &quot;At the local level, we aren't privy to any ownershipinformation.&quot;;    Asahi said sources indicated only intense protests in theUnited States could deter Cosmo World from its sales plan. Moreover, the saleof private memberships does not necessarily mean that non-members will bebarred from the course.;    Three other Pebble Beach Co. courses on theMonterey Peninsula -- Spyglass Hill, Spanish Bay and Old Del Monte -- alsowere included in the speculation about going private.;    &quot;I don't thinkselling a bunch of these memberships would necessarily mean Pebble Beach wouldbe full of corporate members,&quot; said Harold Firstman, the director of the BenHogan Pebble Beach Invitational Pro-Am, formerly known as the Spalding Pro-Am.&quot;There still would be room for the public.&quot;;    For several months, reportscirculated that Cosmo World was having difficulty with its loan and had notfinalized its purchase.;    Alan Greinetz, an executive for Blackman Flynn andamp;Co., a San Francisco real estate firm specializing in Japanese investors, saidhe doubted Cosmo World was seriously concerned about U.S. reaction.;    &quot;Ifthey have closed a deal to buy Pebble Beach, their primary aim is to raise thecapital, not worry about how they will operate one of America's golftreasures,&quot; Greinetz said. &quot;You've got to pay off the mortgage. They have noalternative but to sell the memberships there, because they couldn't do ithere -- $735,000 is an outrageous price.&quot;;    Memberships at Japan's bestcourses cost about $1 million and are traded much like stocks.;    The chancethat Pebble Beach and its three sister courses might become a private playlandfor wealthy Japanese evidently will have no effect on three tournaments thatwill be using the facilities. The Pebble Beach National Pro-Am and the BenHogan Invitational hold tournaments each winter at Pebble and Spyglass, andthe U.S. Open will be held at Pebble Beach in June 1992.;    &quot;As for the U.S.Open, we have a contract with the Pebble Beach Co. and I'm confident it willbe honored,&quot; said Grant Spaeth of Palo Alto, president of the U.S. GolfAssociation. &quot;The new owners actually have done two very positive things. Theyhave agreed to put on the U.S. Amateur in 1994, the first time since 1961 thatPebble Beach has agreed to this, and they've expanded use of the course forthe California State Amateur.&quot;;    Other reactions were mixed.;    &quot;PebbleBeach is really mainly for tourists because of the cost,&quot; said LanceHeidinger, president of San Jose Country Club. &quot;It's becoming like AugustaNational and Cypress Point -- you dream of playing them, but you know younever will.&quot;;    Frank Brunk Jr., president of the Northern California GolfAssociation, representing 120,000 members, said the possibility Pebble mightgo private &quot;has been one of my worst fears. But it is getting so expensive($200) that few of our members can afford it.&quot;;  If Pebble goes private; (box)Private memberships to Pebble Beach costing $735,000 apiece would be sold inJapan.; (box) The estimated $559 million raised would go toward paying thepurchase price, reportedly $900 million.; (box) The sister courses -- SpyglassHill, Spanish Bay and Old Del Monte -- may go private, too.; (box) The privatestatus would not affect the Pebble Beach National Pro Am and the Ben HoganPebble Beach Invitational -- tournaments held each winter -- or the 1992 U.S.Open.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910308  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  758  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 8, 199100068079,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
