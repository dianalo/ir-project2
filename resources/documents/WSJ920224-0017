But for all the increasing complexity, many of the basicideas and techniques genetic engineers use to make drugs haveremained the same since they first began tinkering with genesmore than a decade ago. Their main trick is gene splicing,the process of isolating pieces of DNA and plugging them intobacteria or other cells to produce large amounts oftherapeutically valuable proteins.</LP><TEXT>   Bioengineers also continue to develop new drugs anddiagnostics based on another pivotal technology that helpedlaunch their industry in the 1970s: monoclonal antibodies.These are immune-system molecules tailored to act as &quot;magicbullets,&quot; selectively sticking to, and potentially knockingout, cancer or other cells.   The gene splicer's goal usually is to make a naturallyoccurring protein that performs an important function, suchas promoting the growth of red blood cells. Often theproteins are impractical to extract from tissues orsynthesize with traditional chemical methods.Bioengineering's magic lies in programming nonhuman cells toproduce these hard-to-obtain human molecules.   Cells -- from bacteria to human neurons -- employ genes,which are pieces of DNA, as blueprints for making proteins,molecules that serve as building blocks and metabolicworkhorses in the body. Scientists scissor out selected genesfor making, say, insulin and paste them into bacteria cells'DNA molecules.   Next, bioengineers let their customized microbes do whatcomes naturally -- multiply -- by putting them in a kind ofnutrient soup in big vats. The more bacteria there are, themore insulin they make. Eventually, the insulin is extracted,purified and sold as a drug to diabetics, who suffer from aninternal insulin shortage.   Many variations of gene splicing are emerging. Forinstance, instead of simply transferring single genes fromone species to another, scientists now are fabricatingartificial, multipart genes that, when inserted in bacteria,produce proteins with novel combinations of desiredproperties. Such &quot;chimeric&quot; proteins include potentialanti-cancer drugs whose molecules act as Trojan horses: Partof the molecule resembles a substance that tumor cellsreadily absorb, while the other part is a toxic substancethat kills the tumor cell.   This Trojan horse idea also is being tried with monoclonalantibodies, the &quot;magic bullet&quot; technology. Antibodies aremolecules made by the immune system to fend off viruses andother invading microorganisms. Their shapes are complementaryto &quot;antigenic&quot; molecules on the surfaces of foreign microbes,causing the antibodies to single out and clasp them like theglass slipper singling out Cinderella.   In the 1970s, researchers developed methods to isolate andgrow batches of immune cells from mice that produce countlessidentical antibodies. The methods also enabled scientists totailor these monoclonal antibodies, or MABs, so that theywould stick to a molecule of interest -- such as one found onthe surfaces of cancer cells but rarely on normal ones. Bychemically linking toxins to such MABs, scientists hoped tomake microscopic guided missiles that would kill cancer cellswithout harming surrounding healthy tissue.   MAB experts soon discovered that making effective drugsbased on their promising technology was harder than expected.MABs produced by mouse cells tend to trigger adverse immuneresponses when injected into humans. Finding MABs selectiveenough to attach to bad cells without also sticking to goodones posed problems. But the major problems have now been atleast partly solved, and a number of companies are nearingpaydirt with MAB-based drugs for treating shock from acuteinfections, cancer and other disorders.   But what, after all, is antisense?   Briefly, it's a technique for blocking genes so they can'tbe used within cells to make proteins. The blocking agent isa DNA-like molecule tailored to stick to and disable aspecific, complementary piece of DNA, or a related moleculecalled messenger RNA, in cells. One use of antisense is toprevent potentially harmful proteins from being made -- forinstance, ones that cause cancer.   Though antisense makes sense in principle, experimentaldrugs based on it haven't yet been shown to work in humans.But the idea is promising enough to have sparked a heatedresearch and development race among a half-dozen or so smallbiotechnology companies, including Genta Inc., GileadSciences Inc., Hybridon Inc. and Synthecell Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
