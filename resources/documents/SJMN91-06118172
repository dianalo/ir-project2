And the abundant number of little Warriorswill shoot first and ask questions later on offense, and trap, double and helpon defense.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE ROBINSON PLANWARRIORS WILL CONTINUE TO LEAN ON SPURS STAR  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;We had a good game plan,&quot; Warriors Coach Don Nelson said about the 130-121loss Thursday in Game 1. &quot;We made errors. I learned some things that will helpus in the next game.&quot;;    Nelson kept practice closed Friday at HemisFairArena. Maybe the Warriors worked on a method to stop the half-court lob thatWillie Anderson threw to Robinson in the fourth quarter. Something like havingTom Tolbert stand on Alton Lister's shoulders.;    That wouldn't work, or belegal. What the Warriors will continue to do is hammer on Robinson with asuccession of defenders -- Lister, Jim Petersen, Tolbert, Tyrone Hill and, ifthose people use all 24 allotted fouls, Paul Mokeski.;    &quot;Our task is to givehim a bad time,&quot; Petersen said. &quot;We're going to continue to play physical.&quot;;   Robinson challenged both Lister and Petersen in the first quarter Thursdayafter being thrown to the floor by each of them. The fan reaction was about asexpected in a place where they think Robinson can take the famous river walkwithout using the banks.;    &quot;I wasn't trying to disrupt all of San Antonio,&quot;Petersen said. &quot;I was just trying to protect my space. I guess it would besafe for me to walk the streets around here. I don't know. I went back to myroom and watched the Holyfield-Foreman fight on HBO. Hey, that was a goodfight!&quot;;    Nelson's strategy worked in the first half when Robinson scoredonly eight points and played just 12 minutes. But when the Warriors wenttimid, then small, in the second half, Robinson exploded for 22 points.;   Nelson blamed pregame newspaper speculation about his rough-house strategy forthe 12 fouls called on his big men.;    &quot;I know referees read newspapers, andit had an effect on the game,&quot; Nelson said. &quot;They ran mug shots of our guysand everything.;    &quot;I think if you look at the film you'll see David Robinsoninstigates most of it. I've got to hand it to him. He's being aggressive. He'sthe aggressor.&quot;;    Robinson laughed when that quote was relayed to him,saying, &quot;I've got no comment on that. . . . The refs did a fantastic job.;   &quot;I face that stuff night in and night out. I expected them to play physicaland try to take me out of my game. It was a fun game. I don't take that stuffpersonally. This is a physical sport. I can accept that.&quot;;    The Spurs wondespite not having the services of David Wingate, their best perimeterdefender. He remains doubtful with a pulled right hamstring. His absence mightmake Spurs Coach Larry Brown change his game plan and slow down the pace.;   &quot;I don't think we can play 130-point games and win this series,&quot; Brown saidafter holding an open practice. &quot;That's their style.&quot;;    As in allbest-of-five series, the second game is heavily significant. Only three teamshave come back from 0-2 deficits to win one of these things, and one of themwas the Warriors against Utah four years ago. Teams winning the first gamehave captured the series 47 of 56 times.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RON BERGMAN, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Antonio, Texas  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910427  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  596  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday April 27, 199100118172,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
