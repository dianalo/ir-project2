PLC's ACandamp;R/ DHB andamp; Bess unit to create advertising for its Sterling cars, the third agency to advertise the luxury cars in 14 months.    The account is expected to bill more than $20 million annually.    The car company said it chose ACandamp;R largely because of its connection to Saatchi agency BSB Dorland Ltd., which handles advertising for the British Rover Group PLC, Austin Rover's parent company. ACandamp;R handles annual billings of about $325 million.    Austin Rover has had a rough ride since the Stering luxury car was introduced in 1987. Car sale figures have been disappointing, agency relations have been stormy and the firm changed presidents in May when Austin Rover bought the 51% stake in the firm held by automobile-dealer Norman Braman. </TEXT></DOC>
