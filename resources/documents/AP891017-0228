Greenspan, addressing the American Bankers Association onMonday, cited recent efforts by banks to build their capital, thecushion that protects government insurance funds and by extensionthe taxpayers from losses.   But, he added, ``despite the progress many of you have made inrecent years ... capital levels for the industry remain at the lowend of their broad historical range.''   ``Current levels (of 6.3 percent of assets) are one-sixth thelevels of the mid-1800s, and are less than one-half the level some50 years ago,'' he said.   In some ways, the trend for banks mirrors the trend forcorporations generally, which in recent years have taken on moredebt, keeping their equity ratios low.   Greenspan pointedly refrained from commenting on the sharpdispute dividing two other banking agencies _ the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.   Both agencies have agreed on a new risk-based capital standardthat gives banks a break for holding relatively safe investmentssuch as government securities and home mortgages. However, theydisagree over a second capital standard, called a leverage ratio,meant to stop banks from sharply reducing their capital byrestructuring their holdings.   The FDIC, which insures bank deposits, is pushing for a leverageratio of 4.5 percent, but the comptroller's office, an arm of theTreasury Department which charters national banks, wants 3 percent.   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said the comptroller's proposalwould reduce standards for 90 percent of the nation's banks,allowing the industry as a whole to hold $8 billion less of asafety cushion. However, Comptroller Robert L. Clarke saidSeidman's proposal would dampen the features of the risk-basedstandard designed to encourage banks to make safe investments.   ``I do not wish to debate the details of which specific ratiosor standards are most appropriate to assess capital adequacy,''Greenspan said. But ``it is important to keep in mind that, in bothrelative and absolute terms, banking is a highly leveragedindustry.''   He said bank owners have an incentive to minimize their capitalas a way of maximizing their stockholders' return. However, when afinancial institution holds inadequate capital, its owners do nothave the proper exposure to limit risky activity, he said.   Moreover, the risks in banking today are arguably higher thanthey were in the days when banks had higher capital ratios, thechairman said.   ``The number and size of failures we have seen in both thebanking and thrift industries demonstrate clearly that depositoryinstitutions must maintain sound capital positions and be able todeal with unexpected events,'' he said.   Greenspan made only a brief reference to the turmoil in worldstock markets on Friday and Monday. Greenspan said the Fed had alsobeen in ``productive contact'' with foreign governments, but didnot elaborate on what actions the United States and othergovernments were taking.</TEXT></DOC>
