Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> SDO SCE TEP </CO><IN> TNM UTI </IN><TEXT>   Many Wall Street observers say an acquisition of San Diego Gas andamp; Electric Co. by the larger SCEcorp is likely in the wake of the San Diego utility's termination last week of a separate merger agreement with Tucson Electric Power Co.    &quot;If put to a vote now, I think SDGandamp;E shareholders would overwhelmingly vote to merge with (SCEcorp's) Southern California Edison&quot; unit, said Edward J. Tirello Jr., a utilities analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. He said San Diego Gas's management will &quot;have to sit down and speak to (SCEcorp). It's a very balanced offer. What did the San Diego shareholder get with the Tucson offer? All he got was dilution.&quot;    An SCEcorp spokeswoman said the company's takeover offer of $2.36 billion in stock, which San Diego Gas rejected in September in favor of the earlier, $1.9 billion stock swap agreement it had with Tucson Electric, remains in effect. However, she declined comment on whether SCEcorp was in negotiations with San Diego Gas. A San Diego Gas spokesman declined all comment. In announcing the termination of the Tucson Electric agreement last Thursday evening, the San Diego utility said it would consider its alternatives, including a combination with SCEcorp.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, San Diego Gas shares jumped $1.875 to close at $36.75 on the anticipation that an SCEcorp acquisition of San Diego Gas or some sort of restructuring might be forthcoming. SCEcorp shares fell 87.5 cents to $33.375, and Tucson Electric was off 50 cents, closing at $52.75.    A combination of SCEcorp and San Diego Gas would create the nation's biggest investor-owned utility, with more than $17 billion in assets and serving 54,000 square miles of territory in southern and central California.    Just why San Diego Gas terminated the agreement with Tucson Electric wasn't made clear. One analyst who asked not to be identified said that if San Diego Gas &quot;wasn't going to consider the SCEcorp offer, they'd just have gone ahead with Tucson.&quot;    San Diego Gas indicated that the offer was terminated mainly because the two utilities couldn't agree on a way to defeat SCEcorp's efforts to block the merger. SCEcorp had demanded San Diego Gas's shareholder list, and had filed a petition with the Securities and Exchange Commission a few weeks ago that some analysts say was a request to launch a hostile tender offer. SCEcorp also last week filed with the California Public Utilities Commission for approval to acquire San Diego Gas.    Shearson Lehman's Mr. Tirello said that a recent action by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission concerning a proposed merger of PacifiCorp and Utah Power andamp; Light Co. could have put a damper on the proposed Tucson Electric/San Diego Gas combination. The FERC approved the PacifiCorp/Utah Power merger only on the condition that, if PacifiCorp is allowed to acquire the Utah concern, it must give other utilities access to wholesale transmission lines at cost. A ruling such as that would prove very unattractive to Tucson Electric, which had been looking at a combination with San Diego Gas as a way to sell its excess power in Southern California, Mr. Tirello said.    A Tucson Electric spokesman said Friday that it had adopted a &quot;modified resource plan and construction schedule&quot; that will allow it to find other purchasers for its excess capacity now that the San Diego Gas merger has been called off.    The utility has decided to delay completion of a 360,000-kilowatt, coal-fired unit at its Springerville plant in eastern Arizona until December 1990, and to shut down the aging 100,000-kilowatt DeMoss Petrie generating station in Tucson when the new unit comes on line. The company will also delay the conversion of a unit at its Irvington Generating Station to 1992 from 1991.    And Tucson Electric doesn't plan any other mergers to solve its excess-capacity problem, the spokesman said. &quot;Right now, we are putting our eggs back in the basket of rescheduled construction and long-term contracts with other power utilities.&quot;    In the event San Diego Gas is acquired by SCEcorp, Tucson Electric will be entitled to a $25 million fee promised under the original merger agreement. </TEXT></DOC>
