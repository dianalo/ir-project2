Under the accord, Israel has given Walsh the historical andfinancial chronologies covering its role in the shipment of U.S.weapons to Iran in 1985 and 1986, said an Israeli official.   ``He (Walsh) will get what he wants without us having to give upwhat we wanted,'' said the official, speaking on condition he notbe named.   Israel had sought immunity from prosecution for the four keyIsraeli players in the arms sales, profits from which were divertedto the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.   Two former White House aides and two U.S. businessmen have beenindicted in the United States for conspiracy to defraud thegovernment in the funds' diversion.   Israel also gave Walsh written answers to questions posed by thecongressional investigators who received the Israeli chronologieslast summer, said the official.   ``The government of the state of Israel and the office of theIndependent Counsel have signed an agreement covering thecooperation of the government of Israel in the Iran-Contrainvestigation,'' Walsh's office said in a prepared statement.   Walsh's spokesman, Jim Wieghart, and Israeli Embassy spokesmanYossi Gal said the terms of the agreement are confidential.   Israel had turned over the chronologies to the congressionalIran-Contra committees but refused to give them to Walsh pendinghis promise to refrain from prosecuting the four Israelis involvedin the affair.   Negotiations with Walsh were further complicated when hesubpoenaed the four Israelis: former Foreign Ministry directorDavid Kimche, former counter-terrorism adviser Amiram Nir,businessman Yaakov Nimrodi and his U.S.-born associate, AlSchwimmer.   In asking for immunity, Israel contended that the four acted atthe request of the Israeli government and therefore were notaccountable as individuals.   Two senior Israeli officials held talks with Walsh's office 10days ago to wind up the negotiations, which have been going onsince early 1987. The Israeli government approved the accord, saidthe Israeli official.   ``The negotiations were difficult,'' said Wieghart. ``Israel isa sovereign state with certain national security interests, whichthey have to defend. We recognized that, but on the other hand, wehad our needs in this investigation,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
