GalanteStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/10/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   MILWAUKEE SAVORS the taste of Mamie Waters's success. And why not? Until Mrs. Waters opened McCoy's Cake andamp; Pie Shop, she says, Milwaukeeans with roots in the South couldn't find a sweet potato pie, a caramel cake or an egg custard pie in any local store. Like a true market-driven entrepreneur, Mrs. Waters says she opened her shop &quot;because I felt there was a need for it.&quot;    Not everyone, though, can read the market as clearly as Mrs. Waters. So, Milwaukee has adopted a program to help urban entrepreneurs identify and exploit opportunities for new businesses. &quot;The market mechanism is efficient, but not perfect, in sending out signals to entrepreneurs,&quot; says James M. Howell, chief economist at the Bank of Boston and chairman of the Council for Economic Action, a nonprofit group that developed the model on which the Milwaukee program is based.    The council's program does more than help ambitious inner-city residents spot opportunities. It also tutors them in business skills and provides follow-up assistance. Mrs. Waters, for instance, marvels that her shop managed to survive before she took the 10-week Milwaukee course last winter. &quot;I could bake, but I didn't know anything about business,&quot; she says.    IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, the council's program has caught on in 10 other cities around the country, including Stockton, Calif.; Portsmouth, Va., and Atlanta. Another 10 cities are planning to adopt it by the end of next year. Its aim is to bring more inner-city residents into the economic mainstream. &quot;We're trying to involve people in business creation and ownership who would otherwise be left behind or left out,&quot; Mr. Howell says.    The council takes a decidedly capitalistic approach to the creation of these urban enterprises. &quot;Many government programs make the assumption that small businesses need to be subsidized early on to gain access to the capital markets,&quot; Mr. Howell says. &quot;We think that's wrong. We start out with the view that any small business, to be successful, must start out with access to the capital markets at market rates.&quot;    To accomplish that, the council's programs follow a rigorous format intended to make each new business a bankable enterprise. When the council launches the program in a new city, its first step is to survey the area to see which industries appear to have too many competitors and which seem to have too few. It then steers entrepreneurs toward undersupplied industries and away from ones that are oversupplied.    The would-be owners take two sets of classes: a short course that covers the basics of owning a business and a longer course that covers product planning, finance, personnel management, marketing and other business subjects in depth. At the end of the longer course, each student is supposed to have a business plan that he or she can present to a bank.    IT DOESN'T ALWAYS work that way in reality. Many students enter the program with an idea for a business, and they stick with it no matter what the council's survey finds. Many take the short course but not the long one. And not everyone who completes the long course manages to prepare a business plan.    The dropout rate is high. Mr. Howell estimates that about 70% of the people who take the short course decide against starting a business. But he sees that as a plus rather than a minus. &quot;This is what bankers say they really like,&quot; he says, &quot;because it discourages people who aren't adequately prepared for the complexities of running a business.&quot;    On the other hand, the survival rate of businesses started through the program is encouraging. Of 31 businesses started in Boston since 1984 by program participants, 29 are still operating.    One of them is Edwards Personnel Services in that city's predominently black Roxbury section. Owner Linda Edwards credits the council's program with helping her to make the decision to quit her previous job as a Friendly's Ice Cream store manager to open the employment service in 1984.    Billings this year are running at an annual rate of about $210,000, or 25% more than last year. So, Ms. Edwards has asked council advisers to help her prepare an application for a $50,000 loan to expand. &quot;Right now,&quot; she says, &quot;the main thing is for us to make sure our business plan is airtight when we take it to the bank.&quot;    THE URBAN ENTREPRENEURS cite both the tangible and intangible benefits of the program. The Rev. Wilma Joyce Irvin knew nothing about business before she attended the council's classes in Boston. Now, she is starting Reverend Ms. Apparel Co. to make custom-sewn religious apparel for clergywomen. &quot;I went from 'Maybe' to 'I can,'&quot; she says. In Portsmouth, Va., George Klein credits the program's advisers with helping to narrow the focus of his business, Randamp;K Fix-It Inc., and to obtain a liability insurance policy.    Back in Milwaukee, Mrs. Waters says the business classes taught her how to bring her bake shop's bookkeeping under control and how to deal with difficult employees. She also learned that, instead of opening a second store, it would be cheaper to expand by marketing frozen cakes and pies through retailers, which she will do under the McCoy's label.    &quot;It's my mom's name, and these are her recipes I'm using,&quot; Mrs. Waters says. &quot;She baked for her neighbors and friends. Now, I'm baking for anybody that will buy it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
