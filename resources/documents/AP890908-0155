(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A minister testified Friday he felt``robbed and cheated'' when he bought lifetime partnerships fromtelevision evangelist Jim Bakker for lodging in a hotel that wasnever built.   After Bakker's trial recessed for the day, the same judgesentenced two former Bakker aides to up to 18 years in prison andfined them $500,000 each for tax evasion.   The Rev. Alan Foor, pastor of the United Church of Christ inBeavertown, Pa., testified at Bakker's trial that he was a monthlycontributor to Bakker's PTL, but became angry when he learned howwell Bakker lived.   Foor's testimony wrapped up this week's court proceedings oncharges that Bakker used nearly $4 million in ministry funds tofinance an extravagant lifestyle. Prosecutors say Bakker used fundsfrom the sale of partnerships in his hotels.   Partners, who gave at least $1,000, were told they wereguaranteed a certain number of nights per year in a hotel at theministry's Heritage USA retreat near Fort Mill, S.C.   When court recessed for the day at lunch, Bakker and his wife,Tammy, waved to a crowd of 300 people outside the courthouse.   ``I'm going to get some rest,'' Bakker said. Thursday was thefirst full day of testimony after the trial resumed followingBakker's breakdown and commitment to a federal prison forpsychiatric evaluation last week.   Bakker's former personal aide, David Taggart, was sentenced to 18years and five months in prison and fined $500,000. His brother,James Taggart, PTL's former interior decorator, was sentenced to 17years and nine months and fined $500,000. They were convicted inJuly and faced up to 25 years in prison and fines of $1 million each.   ``White collar criminals seem to get away with extremely lightsentences,'' U.S. District Judge Robert Potter said before imposingsentence. ``It's time we do something about that.''   The Taggarts were convicted of evading taxes on $1.1 million inPTL funds that they used to pay for personal luxuries, such as aTrump Tower apartment in New York, Jaguar cars, Cartier watches andGucci items.   The Taggarts left the courthouse without speaking to reporters.   In 1986, Foor said, he saw Bakker on the PTL Club televisionshow, touting the Tower Club and the Victory Warrior memberships.   Foor testified that on June 18, 1986, he sent $1,000 charged on acredit card, saying that was the last day of a promotion offeringtwo memberships for the price of one.   ``The way I understood it, I was buying into a time share forfour days and three nights each year,'' Foor said. But he said henever was able to use the lodging because the hotel wasn't completed.   Foor said he became angry when PTL sent him a letter asking thathe buy another partnership.   Foor said he disagreed with Bakker's rationale of blaming hisproblems on the devil.   ``How dumb does he think people are,'' Foor wrote in a letter toPTL in April 1987, about a month after Bakker resigned from PTLbecause of a sexual scandal.   He wrote that he earned $18,000 a year, and loved and forgave theBakkers but added: ``Until I see a better and more honest use of mymoney, I will withhold my contributions.''   He said he got a response from PTL asking him to call. But hedecided later to file a claim with U.S. Bankruptcy Court, as anumber of other partners did.   Outside the courtroom, Foor said he felt sorry for the Bakkers.``My heart goes out to them,'' he said.   But he quickly added that if someone commits a crime, he has to``pay his dues.''   ``The biggest thing I wanted to hear was Jim and Tammy to saythat they made a mistake,'' Foor said. ``I never heard that. ... Ifeel I was duped.''   In Richmond Va., a federal appeals court Friday denied Bakker'smotion for a stay of his trial. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals also rejected Bakker's motion to dismiss the indictmentagainst him.</TEXT></DOC>
