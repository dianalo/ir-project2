(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Beach mice threatened with extinctionon the Central Gulf Coast have emerged from winter breeding ingreater numbers, but there still aren't many of the tinynight-wandering creatures.   Scientists aren't sure what role the Choctawhatchee, Alabama andPerdido Key beach mice play in the environment; they seem to beclosely associated to the growth of sea oats, but even that has notbeen proven.   In 1986, alarmed U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists begantrapping and removing the mice from the path of condominiumconstruction booms along the Gulf. Thirty Perdido Key mice weremoved to the Gulf Islands National Seashore. The Perdido Key micewere completely eliminated from Florida during Hurricane Fredericin 1979, and the only remaining ones were on the Alabama beach.   The mice now are reported thriving in the 7-mile protected GulfIslands preserve, said Nick Holler, a professor at AuburnUniversity, where some pairs were taken for breeding. The PerdidoKey mice were the ``most threatened and probably still are,''Holler said.   Some have been trapped in the Bon Secour Wildlife Refuge andFort Morgan, both west of Gulf Shores. They are being introduced tothe colony in captivity against the possibility of anotherhurricane wiping out the wild population.   The main threats to the 3-inch mice are still people walking onsand dunes where the mice burrow to live, and cats. Other predatorsare owls and foxes.   Other threatened or endangered species also are finding refugein National Park Service's Gulf Islands National Seashore, saidspokeswoman Suzanne Lewis. Projects there include efforts tore-establish populations of Southern Bald Eagles, Brown Pelicansand Red Wolves.   Horn Island, a wilderness barrier island in the Mississippiportion of the preserve, has been the release site for 19 youngeagles since 1985. Plans call for up to 50 birds to be releasedthis year on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.   Horn Island also will be the release site for a pair of RedWolves to begin five years of research on the biology of theanimals. Young wolves also will be released on the Alligator RiverNational Wildlife Refuge in North Carolina.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for April 27</NOTE></DOC>
