Moody's Investors Service Inc., however, maintained its ratings on securities of Mississippi Power andamp; Light Co., a unit, despite this week's order by the Mississippi Public Service Commission to stop the unit's collection of a previously awarded rate increase and to refund the amount collected since September 1985.    The decision by Mississippi regulators may have &quot;dire financial consequences&quot; for the unit, Moody's said, but the rating concern expected the order to be quickly reversed in an appeal pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.    Sandamp;P said Mississippi Pandamp;L may be forced into insolvency if the Supreme Court doesn't order the rate rise kept in place.    Sandamp;P also cited the adverse consequences of a decision by Louisiana regulators to reverse part of a rate increase granted to Louisiana Power andamp; Light Co., another Middle South unit.    A Middle South spokesman said the company wasn't &quot;surprised&quot; by the Sandamp;P downgradings but nevertheless thinks they may have been &quot;premature,&quot; because Mississippi's regulatory action may be reversed.    Sandamp;P lowered the rating of New Orleans Public Service's senior debt to single-B from triple-B-minus and downgraded its preferred stock to triple-C from double-B-plus.    Sandamp;P downgraded Mississippi Pandamp;L's senior debt to single-B from triple-B-minus, its subordinated debt to triple-C-plus from double-B-plus and its preferred stock to triple-C from double-B-plus.    Louisiana Pandamp;L's senior debt was downgraded to double-B from triple-B-minus and its preferred stock to single-B-plus from double-B-plus.    The rating on Arkansas Power andamp; Light Co.'s senior debt was reduced to double-B from triple-B-minus, and its subordinated debt and preferred stock ratings were lowered to single-B-plus from double-B-plus.    System Energy Resources Inc.'s senior debt was downgraded to double-B-minus from double-B-plus, and a proposed preferred stock offering was downgraded to single-B-plus from double-B.    The rating concern removed the affected issues from CreditWatch, where they were placed April 29. </TEXT></DOC>
