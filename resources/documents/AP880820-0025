Chairman Frank Lorzenzo disclosed the plan here Friday outside acourt hearing at which he defended plans for a major layoff atContinental's sister Eastern Airlines.   Lorenzo, also chairman of Texas Air Corp., which owns bothEastern and Continental, said a formal announcement of theContinental layoff would come in the next few days along with thecarrier's new fall schedule.   He told reporters the layoff would involve 2 percent to 6percent of the company's 36,000 employees and include flightattendants as well as some management personnel.   Between 300 and 500 pilots would be involved, Lorenzo said.   Continental posted a net loss of $231 million in the first sixmonths of this year and announced earlier that there would beservice cutbacks.   At the hearing, Lorenzo said its was necessary to lay off some4,000 employees and cut back service at Miami-based Eastern.   The cuts, which would curtail service to 14 cities, wereannounced earlier but have been blocked thus far under terms of atemporary restraining order issued by U.S. District JudgeBarrington D. Parker at the request of three unions that representEastern employees.   Lorenzo said the cuts were needed to save the financiallytroubled line.   ``If Eastern's management is not permitted to take the actionsto save this company, then Eastern may run out of cash,'' Lorenzosaid.   He denied suggestions by attorneys for the employees that he hasbeen attempting to engage in so-called union busting bytransferring Eastern's assets to Continental. He also said therewas no plan to merge the lines.   The cutbacks represent an effort ``to stabilize the company ...and decrease the losses,'' Lorenzo said.   Union attorneys did question Lorenzo about the draft of a speechthat he was to give to Japanese investors in 1986 after Texas Airbought Eastern.   It said the purchase gave Texas Air leverage over the union.``Eastern's airplanes can be repainted and moved over toContinental where they will be flown by non-union pilots,'' it said.   Lorenzo said an investment banking firm prepared the speech. Itwas unclear whether he ever delivered it.</TEXT></DOC>
