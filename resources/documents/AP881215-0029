Adversaries put the emphasis on ``tough'' butacknowledge his ability to strike a bargain.   Yeutter has been the nation's No. 1 negotiator on agriculturaland other international trade issues for the past 3{ years. He iswidely respected at home and abroad for his aggressive push to makeforeign markets more open to U.S. products and for his ability tosoften harsh protectionist legislation in Congress.   A man who needs very little sleep, runs on a treadmill threetimes a week and always appears affable and reasonable, Yeutter hasbeen an effective ambassador for U.S. producers and manufacturers.   Cajoling and threatening, he managed to talk the Japanese intoopening their market to American beef exporters, and he persuadedthe Europeans to import more U.S. citrus fruits. He also spearheadeda U.S. drive to stop Japan from dumping semiconductors, or sellingthem abroad at prices below the cost of production.   In naming him to his new post, Bush said Yeutter is ``so widelyrespected'' that he would have a ``running start'' on plans to openforeign markets even further to U.S. farm produce.   Yeutter will have a chance to see through a contentious fightwith the European Economic Community over U.S. demands for theelimination of agricultural subsidies. The next meeting on that isscheduled for April in Geneva.   His main opponent in that fight, chief EEC negotiator Willy DeClercq, is also a fan. ``He is very good, very skillful, also verystubborn,'' De Clercq said last week as he confronted Yeutter atinternational trade talks in Montreal.   Another participant at that meeting, Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.,had profuse praise for the 58-year-old Yeutter. ``He's dynamite,''was the evaluation of the ranking minority member of the FinanceCommittee. ``He's the guy you want to have back-to-back with you ina knife fight.''   Yeutter was considered for the top Agriculture Department job in1980 by President-elect Reagan but was passed over because ofobjections from some members of Congress.   In the Nixon and Ford administrations he served as AssistantSecretary of Agriculture, running regulatory programs such as meatinspection and animal health, and overseeing a dramatic increase infarm exports.   The push for further increasing farm exports has been paramounton his agenda as Trade Representative. Critics say he focused onthis to the detriment of other important trade issues.   His main emphasis has been on attempts to get an internationalcommitment to eliminate farm subsidies, which the U.S. governmentcontends distort world trade and work to the detriment of Americanfarmers and exporters of farm products.   ``Agriculture is too important to nibble at the edges ofreform,'' he repeatedly argued during the Montreal trade meetingearlier this month. ``It must be changed radically.''   Yeutter agreed to take the top agriculture post despite an oftenstated desire to return to the private sector. In his last privatesector job he headed the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world'ssecond largest futures market.   Yeutter, who has four children, grew up on a Nebraska farm andstill manages a 2,500 property in the town of Cozad.</TEXT></DOC>
