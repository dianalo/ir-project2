We've only been a country for little more than200 years, and it wasn't unusual for a son of a man born inMartin Van Buren's time to have experienced the harshness ofthe plains settlements, the agrarian revolts of the late 19thcentury, the Great War of 1914, the Great Depression -- andmore.   And so Charles W. Bailey settled on a neat trick with hisnew epic of the American great plains. &quot;The Land Was Ours&quot;(Harper-Collins/Bessie Books, 386 pages, $21.95) is nominallya novel about a prairie newspaperman who saw a lot just byobserving. It is really a life-and-times biography of afictional character and a real country.</LP><TEXT>   Through the pages of this book stride such figures asrailroad entrepreneur James J. Hill, agrarian rebel MaryLease, Kansas editor William Allen White, political boss MarkHanna, populist troubador James B. Weaver and others: WilliamJennings Bryan, Theodore Roosevelt, Sam Rayburn. Mr. Bailey,moreover, gives us the whole panoply of Western history: theGreat Blizzard of 1888, when the temperature fell 50 degreesin a few hours and the snow fell like lint; the Populistmovement, which galvanized the West once the free land andthe easy credit were gone; and the despair that fills theland when there is no rain in two years.   In the middle of all this stands Dan Woods, who carriesthe memory of the chill in the air in his father's sod housein Hall County, Neb., to the Dakota Territory and through anewspapering career that would take him and his paper to acommanding position in South Dakota. At national politicalconventions, in the halls of Congress, at the blacktypewriter where he composes his final columns, he remembershow the dust flew off the walls and roofs when it was dry andhow the mud plopped to the floor in the rainy season. Likethe country itself, Dan moved to town, but he would always beone of those who trusted in God and was busted in Nebraska.   Of course the story itself is fairly standard: Young mansuffers hardship. Works hard. Marries the right girl. Risesin his community. Sees a bit of life along the way and fearsfor his country. It is the American story.   But there is something endearing about this rendering.Though he consciously avoids the life of the soil that hadbroken his father, Dan Woods feels the tug of the land. As ayoung man he was excited by the ascendancy of TheodoreRoosevelt, but he thought the dude politician was &quot;bad newsfor farmers and for our part of the country, because we'retoo few and too far away.&quot; The rest of the country may be inthe 20th century, he reckoned, &quot;but we're still in the 19th.&quot;And when he's offered the big job as a political reporter forthe Minneapolis Tribune, he says: &quot;I just can't walk awayfrom my paper -- and my town, the people. The land.&quot;   These kinds of novels aren't written much these days.There's strong feeling here but not much guilt. There'spassion but only one sex scene, eight paragraphs long. Butthere is drama. In this world the grasshoppers can come withthe fury of a hurricane and wipe out a whole season's gardenvegetables and grain crop in a few minutes. In this world,people who live on a farm can sometimes have it so bad thatthey have to buy their food in town.   I've never met Charles Bailey, former Washington bureauchief and editor of the Minneapolis Tribune, but by readingabout Dan Woods I believe I know him now, or at least theimpulse that drew him to journalism, or newspapering, as weused to call this business before we got fancy. Dan Woods isthe kid who gets his job after some poor clumsy soul drops atray full of type. He becomes a printer's devil (thejack-of-all-trades of our trade), then a reporter. He triesto explain the special joy of newspapering but his motherdoesn't quite understand. It sounded to her a lot like&quot;loafing and gossipping.&quot; Maybe she did understand, afterall.   He starts writing up the local notes, the little itemslike the fact that attorney Christopher Todd went toMinneapolis on business and the news that Paul Grew's drafthorses drew 3,200 pounds of lumber. But this isn't only thestory of Dan Woods. There are peeks here behind the scenes ofhistory: glimpses, say, of William McKinley running forpresident by sitting surreally still in a white frame houseset under the tall oaks of Canton, Ohio, and seldom venturingbeyond the front porch to deliver a few remarks to visitors;and hints at how choreographed political elections were evena century ago, when &quot;spontaneous&quot; questions to a candidatewere in fact approved in advance.   By the time Dan Woods has his heart attack in 1938, he'slived through the Greenbackers, the Grangers, the Alliance,the Populists, the Progressives and the New Dealers. He'sseen two Roosevelts become president, two panics devastatethe prairie states and one depression bring the nation to thebrink of catastrophe. He's grown up, with the country. In&quot;Seven Days in May,&quot; written with Fletcher Knebel, CharlesBailey showed how the country almost came apart in a coupattempt. In &quot;The Land Was Ours&quot; he shows how it was built.   Mr. Shribman is a staff reporter in the Journal'sWashington bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
