That assessment, the gloomiest so far, was included in newprojections by the FDIC that take into account increasedproblem lending in real estate, particularly by big EastCoast banks. Previously, the FDIC projected that the fundwould be in the red by $4.6 billion at the end of 1992,assuming a delay in the economic recovery.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;In 1992, we see a substantial deterioration&quot; in the fund,Mr. Seidman told the House Budget Committee. For the pastyear, the fund, as a percentage of the deposits it protects,has been at the lowest level in its 57-year history.   The new FDIC loss expectations represent a shift in badnews from this year to next. They show a short-termimprovement in the fund balance for the remainder of 1991, to$1.7 billion, apparently assuming the tottering big bankshave enough capital to hold on until next year. A few weeksago, the FDIC projected that the fund's net worth would be$200 million by year end.   In an interview Wednesday, Mr. Seidman said unequivocallythat the FDIC expects the fund to be exhausted by year end.But yesterday he backtracked, saying he erred. &quot;I apologizefor that,&quot; he said.   In his testimony, however, he conceded that such ascenario isn't out of the question. &quot;Under the pessimisticscenario . . . the FDIC may need expanded borrowing authoritylate in 1991,&quot; he said. Such borrowing would requirecongressional approval.   Moreover, the projected fund balances include heavyborrowings for liquidity, which this year have been neededfor the first time ever. Under its pessimistic scenario for1992, the fund would have $50.2 billion in total borrowingsoutstanding by the end of that year. Even under its mostoptimistic assumptions, the fund would require $18.5 billionin new borrowings by year end.   Mr. Seidman cited other ominous indicators for banking,particularly in real estate lending by big banks.   As of June 21, the total assets on the problem bank listjumped to $430.8 billion, from $399.7 billion in March. In1990, U.S. banks charged off an all-time record $29 billionin bad loans, but even as they took that giant hit, theirinventory of troubled assets increased by $23.5 billion --meaning even more credit losses lie ahead. Banks also posteda year-end, record level of past-due loans, 2.9% of allcommercial banking assets.   The commercial real estate slide is hammering banks thatloaded up on real estate loans in the 1980s. About 13% of allconstruction and real estate-development loans are classifiedas non-current, or more than three times the average for allloans. &quot;We built 1993 buildings in 1989,&quot; said Mr. Seidman.   He added that the most pressing problems appear to befocused in big banks. One in every five banks with more than$1 billion in assets reported a net loss for 1990, many ofthem in the Northeast. &quot;I am not going to name names,&quot; hesaid. &quot;I wish {the Northeast} would get well fast, becauseit's breaking the fund at the moment.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
