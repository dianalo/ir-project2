The reading device further includes a rotating      section for holding a boarding pass fed thereto and rotating together with      the boarding pass, and a control circuit for checking the orientation of      the boarding pass inserted into the inlet port, and instructing the      feeding section to temporarily feed the boarding pass to the rotating      section and instructing said rotating section to turn over the boarding      pass when it is detected that the boarding pass has been inserted in a      particular incorrect orientation. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  This invention relates to a reading device for reading data recorded on a      card such as a boarding pass. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Related Art </PAR><PAR>  Before boarding the plane, the passenger inserts his boarding pass into a      reading device located at the boarding gate. Then, the reading device      reads data recorded on the boarding pass and confirms the passenger's name      and seat number/vacancy. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows the layout of a normal boarding pass. The boarding pass 19 has      a passenger's stub 19a and an airline-retained portion 19b which are      separated along a cut-off line 19c at the time of boarding. A magnetic      stripe 19d is formed on the reverse side of the boarding pass 19 and      extends in the lengthwise direction thereof. Data, including the name of      the passenger, the seat number and the like, are recorded on the magnetic      stripe when the boarding pass 19 is issued. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 schematically shows the internal structure of a reading device for      reading data on boarding passes. The reading device has an inlet port 2 on      the front portion thereof. The boarding pass 19 is inserted into the inlet      port 2 in the correct orientation, i.e. face up with the airline-retained      portion 19b preceding the passenger's stub 19a. The inlet port 2 has      predetermined dimensions to guide the inserted boarding pass into the      internal portion. </PAR><PAR>  After insertion, the boarding pass 19 is fed from the inlet port 2 to a      reading section 3 by means of feeding rollers 17 which are disposed along      a feeding path 21. </PAR><PAR>  The reading section 3 has a reading head 4 for reading data recorded on the      magnetic stripe 19d of the boarding pass 19 fed thereto. The reading head      4 is formed with extremely high precision and functions to read recorded      data from the boarding pass 19 when the boarding pass 19 is fed thereto      with the correct orientation maintained. </PAR><PAR>  After the reading operation, the boarding pass 19 is fed to a cutter 5. The      cutter 5 cuts the boarding pass 19 along the cut-off line 19c so as to      separate the boarding pass 19 into the passenger's stub 19a and      airline-retained portion 19b. Subsequently, the airline-retained portion      19b is guided to a collection path 9 selected by a gate valve 6 and is      then received by a hopper 12 via a gate valve 11. Meanwhile, the      passenger's stub 19a is guided to a return path 7 selected by the gate      valve 6 and discharged from an outlet port 8. The passenger then picks up      the discharged passenger's stub 19a of the boarding pass and boards the      plane. </PAR><PAR>  When inserting the boarding pass 19 into the inlet port 2, the boarding      pass 19 may be inserted in an incorrect orientation (for example, the      passenger's stub of the boarding pass 19 is set forward or the reverse      side thereof is set upward) and accepted by the reading device. When the      boarding pass 19 is conveyed to the reading section 3, the reading head 4      cannot read data recorded on the magnetic stripe 19d since the magnetic      stripe 19d does not face the reading head 4. Therefore, it is necessary to      re-insert the pass 19 into the card inlet port 2 in the correct      orientation. </PAR><PAR>  If such a case arises, a problem may occur in the boarding procedure if a      large number of boarding passes 19 must be checked in an extremely short      time. For example, even if a person who is good at handling the reading      device is placed in charge and stationed to receive the boarding passes 19      from the passengers one after another and insert them into the card inlet      port 2 one at a time, there is still a possibility that the may insert a      boarding pass with the front side facing down. Of course, this problem may      more frequently occur when into the inlet port 2 under instructions from      the person in charge. </PAR><PAR>  In order to solve the above problem, the construction of a reading device      is herein considered, in which data can be read irrespective of the      orientation of the boarding pass 19 at the point of insertion. More      specifically, four reading heads 4 are used, two of them disposed above      the boarding pass 19 in the width direction thereof and the remaining two      heads disposed below the boarding pass 19 in the width direction thereof.      With this arrangement, data can be correctly read even when the boarding      pass is inserted with the wrong side set upward or the rear end set      forward. </PAR><PAR>  However, when the reading device 3 is constructed occur: </PAR><PAR>  (1) The manufacturing cost of the reading device becomes higher with an      increase in the number of reading heads 4 which are very precise parts and      consequently expensive. (2) The arrangement of the four reading heads 4 is      determined according to the position of the magnetic stripe of the      boarding pass 19 and cannot be freely changed. As a result, it becomes      difficult to reduce the overall size of the reading device. (3) The      positions of the four reading heads 4 must be separately and precisely      adjusted in order to correctly read data even if troublesome. (4) Further,      in order to operate the four reading heads 4 and read data on the boarding      pass 19, a special treatment must be made in order to compensate for      differences between the characteristics of each head. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The object of this invention is to provide a reading device which can be      made small and manufactured at a low cost and which can correctly read      data recorded on a card even when the card is inserted in a particular      incorrect orientation. </PAR><PAR>  The above object can be attained by a reading device which comprises a card      inlet to which a card is inserted; a reading section for reading data      recorded on the card; a transport section for transporting the card from      the card inlet to the reading section; a rotation mechanism for storing      the card supplied thereto during transport, and rotating together with the      card; and a control circuit for checking the orientation of the card      inserted into the card inlet, and for instructing both the transport      section to temporarily feed the card to the rotation mechanism and the      rotation mechanism to turn the card over when it is detected that the card      has been inserted in a particular incorrect orientation. </PAR><PAR>  According to the above reading device, even if the card is inserted into      the card inlet in a particular incorrect orientation, the orientation of      the card can be corrected by means of the rotation mechanism before the      card is fed to the reading section. The rotation mechanism can be operated      by a simple control as well as the transport section, to turn over the      card temporarily supplied to the mechanism during transport. Further, this      mechanism can be modified into a configuration suitable for      miniaturization of the reading device without entailing strict      limitations. </PAR><PAR>  Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the      description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the      description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects      and advantages of the invention may be realized and obtained by means of      the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the      appended claims. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part      of the specification, illustrate a presently preferred embodiment of the      invention, and together with the general description given above and the      detailed description of the preferred embodiment given below, serve to      explain the principles of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a plane view showing the rear face of a normal boarding pass; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a cross sectional diagram showing the internal structure of a      conventional reading device; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a cross sectional diagram showing the internal structure of a      reading device according to one embodiment of this invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a block diagram showing a circuit of the reading device shown in      FIG. 3; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 5 and 6 are respectively a perspective view and a plan view showing      the construction of a rotation section shown in FIG. 3 in detail; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a diagram showing the positional relation of a photosensor and      the rotatable plate shown in FIG. 6; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a perspective view showing the arrangement of a magnetic sensor      in a detecting section shown in FIG. 3; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating the orientations of the boarding pass to      be inserted to the inlet port shown in FIG. 3; and </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 10A to 10H are flowcharts showing the operation of the reading device      of the embodiment. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  A reading device for reading boarding passes according to one embodiment of      this invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. 3 to 10H. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 schematically shows the internal structure of the reading device. As      with the conventional reading device, the reading device includes an inlet      port 2 for insertion of boarding passes 19, a reading section 3, a cutter      5 and an outlet port 8. The reading device further includes a main feeding      section 20, detecting section 30, direction changing section 40, rotating      section 50, sub-feeding section 70 and control circuit 107. </PAR><PAR>  Portions which are the same as those shown in FIG. 2 are denoted by the      same reference numerals, and explanation thereof is omitted or simplified. </PAR><PAR>  The reading section 3 includes a single reading head 4 which is arranged to      read data recorded on the magnetic stripe of a boarding pass 19 as it is      being transported. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 shows the construction of the control circuit. The control circuit      includes a CPU 100, ROM 101 and RAM 102 for controlling the entire portion      of the reading device. The ROM 101 stores a control program for the CPU      100, and the RAM 102 temporarily stores input/output data of the CPU 100.      In an initializing process, various work registers (e.g., flag registers      and counter registers) are provided in the RAM 102. The detecting section      30 and reading section 3 are connected to the CPU 100 via an input port      103. Further, the CPU 100 is connected to the feeding section 20,      direction changing section 40, rotating section 50, sub-feeding section      70, cutter 5 and feed rollers 17 via an output port 105. In addition, the      CPU 100 is connected to a display unit 106 and a keyboard 106a. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 3, the feeding section 20 serves to feed the boarding pass      inserted into the inlet port 2 and to the reading section 3. The feeding      section 20 is constituted by a feeding path 21 and the feeding rollers 17      disposed thereon. </PAR><PAR>  The detecting section 30 serves to detect the magnetic stripe of the      inserted boarding pass 19, and as shown in FIG. 8, it has four magnetic      sensors 31, 32, 33 and 34 disposed at the entrance of the feeding path 21,      sensors 31 and 34 spaced a preset distance from sensors 32 and 33 in the      width direction of the feeding path 21 with a preset distance and with the      feeding path 21 positioned between sensors 31 and 32 and sensors 33 and      34. When the boarding pass 19 shown in FIG. 1 is inserted into the inlet      port 2, that one of the four magnetic sensors 31 to 34 which faces the      magnetic stripe 19d thereof generates a detection signal. The detection      signal is supplied to the CPU 100 via the input port 103. The CPU 100      repeatedly checks the presence of the detection signal supplied from one      of the magnetic sensors 31 to 34 so as to detect the insertion, rear edge,      and orientation of the boarding pass 19. </PAR><PAR>  The direction changing section 40 serves to remove the pass 19 from the      feeding path 21 when the boarding pass 19 is detected as having been      inserted in a particular wrong orientation. The direction changing section      40 is constituted by first and second solenoids M1 and M2, and first and      second gate valves 41 and 42 rotatably mounted on a shaft SH extending in      the width-wise direction of the feeding path 21 and respectively coupled      to the plungers of the first and second solenoids M1 and M2. The solenoids      M1 and M2 are controlled by CPU 100 through the output port 105 so as to      change the angles of the first and second gate valves 41 and 42. The first      and second solenoids M1 and M2 are normally maintained at a rest position      which is separated from the operative position by a preset angle in the      counterclockwise direction. The first and second solenoids M1 and M2 are      respectively energized to set the first and second gate valves 41 and 42      to the operative position. The energization is interrupted to release the      gate valves 41 or 42 from the operative position to the rest position. </PAR><PAR>  When the first gate valve 41 is set at the operative position as shown in      FIG. 3, the upstream side of the feeding path 21 is coupled to a      sub-feeding path 51. When the first gate valve 41 is set at the rest      position, the upstream side of the feeding path 21 is separated from the      sub-feeding path 51. </PAR><PAR>  When the second gate valve 42 is set at the rest position as shown in FIG.      3, the downstream side of the feeding path 21 is separated from the      sub-feeding path 51, and when the second gate valve 42 is set at the      operative position which is separated from the rest position by a preset      angle in the clockwise direction, the downstream side of the feeding path      21 is coupled to the sub-feeding path 51. </PAR><PAR>  The rotating section 50 serves to rotate the boarding pass 19 which is      removed from the feeding path 21 around an axis extending in the feeding      direction of the pass 19 so as to turn the boarding pass 19 over. As shown      in FIG. 5, the rotating section 50 includes two paper guides 52A and 52B,      gear train 55, driving motor 59 and positioning section 61. </PAR><PAR>  The paper guides 52A and 52B are disposed facing each other with a preset      distance therebetween, defining the sub-feeding path 51. As shown in FIG.      6, the paper guides 52A and 52B are so formed as to rotate around a      rotation axis 53. The paper guides 52A and 52B are driven by the driving      motor 59 through the gear train 55. The gear train 55 is constructed of a      gear 56 mounted on the shaft of the driving motor 59, a gear 57 engaged      with the gear 56 and a gear 58 which is engaged with the gear 57 and has      the same number of teeth as the gear 57. The gear 58 rotates around a      rotation axis 53, and the paper guides 52A and 52B are disposed over the      gear 58. </PAR><PAR>  The positioning section 61 serves to detect the amount of rotation of the      paper guides 52, and is constituted by a rotatable plate 62 mounted on the      gear 57 and a photosensor 63. As shown in FIG. 7, cut-away portions 62a      are formed at regular intervals of 90 degrees in the rotatable plate 62,      and the photosensor 63 is placed so as to be in alignment with each of the      cut-away portions 62a. </PAR><PAR>  When the driving motor 59 of the rotating section 50 is driven to rotate      the paper guides 52A and 52B, the rotatable plate 62 is also rotated.      Then, as shown in FIG. 7, when the cut-away portion 62a of the rotatable      plate 62 comes into alignment with the photosensor 63, a signal is output      from the sensor 63 and supplied to the CPU 100 via the output port 105.      The CPU 100 detects the amount of rotation of the paper guides 52A and 52B      based on the received signal and controls the driving motor 59 so as to      rotate the paper guides 52A and 52B by a preset rotation amount which is      necessary to turn over the boarding pass 19. </PAR><PAR>  The sub-feeding section 70 serves to set the boarding pass 19 into the      sub-feeding path 51 and then return the boarding pass 19 to the feeding      path 21, and comprises two sets of conveyor belts 71A and 71B and power      transmission devices 75A and 75B. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIGS. 3 and 5, the conveyor belts 71A and 71B are endless belts      for carrying the boarding pass 19 while holding it therebetween. The      conveyor belt 71A is stretched over the rollers 72A and 73A disposed on      the side of the paper guide 52A so as to travel therebetween. Likewise,      the conveyor belt 71B is stretched over the rollers 72B and 73B disposed      on the side of the paper guide 52B so as to travel therebetween. </PAR><PAR>  The power transmission mechanism 75 serves to selectively transmit the      driving force of the driving motor 74 to one of the conveyor belts 71A and      71B, and is constituted by pulleys 76, 77 and 78, timing belts 79 and 81,      driving roller 82, driven rollers 83A and 83B, gears 84 and 85, holders 92      and solenoid 94. </PAR><PAR>  One pulley 76 is mounted on the shaft of the driving motor 74, another      pulley 77 is rotatably mounted on a supporting shaft 93, and the remaining      pulley 78 is mounted on the driving roller 82. The timing belt 79 is      stretched between the pulleys 76 and 77, and the timing belt 81 is      stretched between the pulleys 77 and 78. </PAR><PAR>  The holders 92 are mounted rotatably around the supporting shaft 93. The      left side ends of the holders 92 in FIGS. 5 and 6 are engaged with the      solenoid 94 so as to be rotated thereby. Further, the driving roller 82 is      rotatably mounted on the right side ends of the holders 92 in the drawings      and can be selectively set in friction contact with one of the driven      rollers 82A and 83B. The driven rollers 83A and 83B are rotatably mounted      on the paper guides 52A and 52B, respectively. Further, a compression      spring 95 is connected to one of the holders 92 which is located on the      left-hand side in FIG. 5 so as to bias the holder 92 in the      counterclockwise direction. </PAR><PAR>  When the solenoid 94 is energized to rotate the holders 92 in the      counterclockwise direction, the driving roller 82 and the driven roller      83A or 83B are set into friction contact with each other. Therefore, the      driving force of the driving motor 74 is transmitted to one of the      conveyor belts 71A and 71B via the power transmission mechanism 75 to move      the belts 71A and 71B in a direction indicated by an arrow H. As a result,      the boarding pass 19 set inside the sub-feeding path 51 is picked up by      means of the conveyor belts 71A and 71B and returned to the feeding path      21 via the second gate valve 42 set in the operative position. </PAR><PAR>  The CPU 100 of the control section 107 performs a control operation for the      elements 20, 30, 40, 50 and 70 by executing the control program stored in      the ROM 101. In this control operation, the orientation of the boarding      pass 19 is corrected if it has been inserted in an incorrect orientation      so that the boarding pass 19 can be supplied in a correct orientation to      the reading section 3. </PAR><PAR>  Next, the operation of the reading device will be explained with reference      to FIG. 9 and FIGS. 10A to 10H. </PAR><PAR>  The boarding pass 19 is inserted into the inlet port 2 of the reading      device in one of the orientations PT1 to PT4 shown in FIG. 9. The magnetic      sensors 31, 32, 33 and 34 of the detecting section 30 generate detection      signals when the boarding pass 19 is inserted in the orientations PT1 to      PT4, respectively. </PAR><PAR>  Upon application of power, the CPU 100 performs the control operation      according to the flow shown in FIGS. 10A to 10H. After the control      operation is started, the circuit elements are initialized, and a stand-by      flag is set. Thereafter, the CPU 100 repeatedly checks whether the      boarding pass 19 is inserted. When the boarding pass 19 is inserted in one      of the orientations PT1 to PT4, the stand-by flag is checked to confirm      that the pairs of feeding rollers 17 rotate in the forward direction, and      then the orientation of the boarding pass 19 is checked. If the rotation      of the feeding rollers 17 is not confirmed, they are driven to rotate in      the forward direction and the stand-by flag is cleared. Further, if the      boarding pass 19 has not been inserted for a preset period TMI after the      previous insertion, the pairs of feeding rollers 17 are stopped and the      stand-by flag is set. </PAR><PAR>  In the case where the boarding pass 19 is inserted into the inlet port 2 in      the correct orientation PT1, the magnetic strip of the boarding pass 19 is      detected by the magnetic sensor 34. Then, the CPU 100 determines that the      pass 19 is inserted in the correct orientation, and permits the boarding      pass 19 to be transported through the main feeding path 21 and fed to the      reading section 3. The pair of feeding rollers 17 nearest to the inlet      port 2 are stopped when it is detected that the rear edge of the pass 19      has passed the detecting section 30, and are restarted when it is detected      that the reading section 3 has finished reading data from the magnetic      stripe of the boarding pass 19 fed from the feeding section 20. </PAR><PAR>  In the case where the boarding pass 19 is inserted into the inlet port 2 in      the orientation PT2 in which the front side is set face up and the      passenger's stub 19a is set in the forward direction, the magnetic stripe      of the boarding pass 19 is detected by the magnetic sensor 33. Then, the      CPU 100 determines that the boarding pass 19 is inserted in the wrong      orientation PT2. The CPU 100 instructs the direction changing section 40      to set the first gate valve 41 in the operative position, and instructs      the sub-feeding section 70 to rotate conveyor belts 71A and 71B in the      forward direction. As a result, the boarding pass 19 is guided from the      feeding path 21 to the sub-feeding path 51. At this time, the boarding      pass 19 is set in the sub-feeding path 51 with the reverse side facing the      front plane la of the main body of the reading device. The pair of feeding      rollers 17 nearest to the inlet port 2 is stopped when it is detected that      the rear edge of the boarding pass 19 has passed the detecting section 30.      Further, when it is detected that a preset period TM2 has passed after the      detection of the rear edge of the pass 19, the first gate valve 41 is      released from the operative position to the rest position, and the      conveyor belts 71A and 71B are stopped. (The preset period TM2 equals a      period in which the rear edge of the boarding pass 19 is required to move      from the detecting section 30 to the top ends of the paper guides 52A and      52B.) </PAR><PAR>  Thereafter, the CPU 100 instructs the rotating section 50 to turn over or      rotate the paper guides 52A and 52B defining the sub-feeding path 51      around the on axis 53 by 180 degree. As a result, the boarding pass 19 is      set with the front side thereof facing the front plane la of the main body      of the reading device. </PAR><PAR>  Next, the CPU 100 instructs the direction changing section 40 to set the      second gate valve 42 to the operative position, and instructs the      sub-feeding section 70 to rotate the conveyor belts 71A and 71B in the      reverse direction. At this time, the boarding pass 19 is returned to the      feeding path 21, and fed to the reading section in the correct      orientation, in which the front side thereof is set face up and the      airline-retained portion 19b is set facing the reading section 3. After      the reading section 3 has finished reading data from the magnetic stripe      of the boarding pass 19 fed from the feeding section 20, the second gate      valve 42 is released from the operative position to the rest position, and      the conveyor belts 71A and 71B are stopped. The pair of feeding rollers 17      nearest the inlet port 2 is restarted after the control process for      discharging the boarding pass 19. </PAR><PAR>  In the case where the boarding pass 19 is inserted into the inlet port 2 in      the incorrect orientation PT3 in which the reverse side thereof is set to      face up and the airline-retained portion 19b is set in the forward      direction, the magnetic stripe is detected by the magnetic sensor 32.      Then, the CPU 100 determines that the pass 19 is inserted in the wrong      orientation PT3, and permits the boarding pass 19 to be transported      through the main feeding path 21. The pair of feeding rollers 17 nearest      to the inlet port 2 are stopped when it is detected that the rear edge of      the boarding pass 19 has passed the detecting section 30. The CPU 100      instructs the feeding section 20 to rotate the remaining pair of feeding      rollers 17 in the reverse direction, instructs the direction changing      section 40 to set the second gate valve 42 to the operative position, and      instructs the sub-feeding section 70 to rotate the conveyor belts 71A and      71B in the forward direction, when it is detected that a preset period TM3      has passed after the detection of the rear edge of the pass 19. (The      preset period TM3 equals a period in which the rear edge of the boarding      pass 19 is required to move from the detecting section 30 to the      downstream entrance of the main feeding path 21.) At this time, the      boarding pass 19 is moved downward along the rear portion of the first      gate valve 41 and the second gate valve 42, and smoothly fed into the      sub-feeding path 51 since the exit portion of the first gate valve 41 is      formed in an arc configuration. When it is detected that a preset period      TM4 has passed after the the change in the rotational direction of the      remaining pairs of feeding rollers 17, the conveyor belts 71A and 71B are      stopped, and the remaining pairs of feeding rollers 17 are rotated in the      forward direction. (The preset period TM4 equals a period in which the      rear edge of the boarding pass 19 is required to move from the downstream      entrance of the feeding path 21 to the bottom ends of the paper guides 52A      and 52B.) In this case, the pass 19 is set in the sub-feeding path 51 with      the reverse side thereof facing the front plane 1a of the main body of the      device. </PAR><PAR>  Thereafter, the CPU 100 instructs the rotating section 50 to turn over the      paper guides 52A and 52B defining the sub-feeding path 51. Then, the front      side of the pass 19 is set facing the front plane 1a of the main body of      the device. In this condition, the sub-feeding section 70 is further      driven to rotate the conveyor belts 71A and 71B in the reverse direction.      As a result, the boarding pass 19 is returned to the downstream of the      main feeding path 21, and fed to the reading section 3 in the correct      orientation. After the reading section 3 has finished reading data from      the magnetic stripe of the boarding pass 19 fed from the rom the operative      position to the rest position, and e conveyor belts 71A and 71B are      stopped. The pair of feeding rollers 17 nearest to the inlet port 2 are      restarted after the control process for discharging the boarding pass 19. </PAR><PAR>  In a case where the boarding pass 19 is inserted into the inlet port 2 in      the incorrect orientation PT4, in which the reverse side thereof is set      face up and the airline-retained portion 19b is set in the forward      direction, the magnetic stripe of the boarding pass 19 is detected by the      magnetic sensor 31. Then, the CPU 100 determines that the pass 19 is      inserted in the wrong orientation PT4. The CPU 100 instructs the direction      changing section 40 to set the first gate valve 41 in the operative      position, and instructs the sub-feeding section 70 to rotate conveyor      belts 71A and 71B in the forward direction. As a result, the boarding pass      19 is guided from the feeding path 21 to the sub-feeding path 51. The pair      of feeding rollers 17 nearest to the inlet port 2 are stopped when it is      detected that the rear edge of the boarding pass 19 has passed the      detecting section 30. Further, when it is detected that a preset period      TM2 has passed after the detection of the rear edge of the pass 19, the      first gate valve 41 is released from the operative position to the rest      position, and the conveyor belts 71A and 71B are stopped. (The preset      period TM2 equals a period in which the rear edge of the boarding pass 19      is required to move from the detecting section 30 to the top ends of the      paper guides 52A and 52B.) At this time, the boarding pass 19 is set in      the sub-feeding path 51 with the front side thereof facing the front plane      la of the main body of the reading device. </PAR><PAR>  Thereafter, the CPU 100 instructs the direction changing section 40 to set      the second gate valve 42 to the operative position, and instructs the      sub-feeding section 70 to rotate the conveyor belts 71A and 71B in the      reverse direction. As a result, the boarding pass 19 is returned to the      feeding path 21, and fed to the reading section in the correct      orientation, in which the front side thereof is set face up and the      airline-retained portion 19b is set facing the reading section 3. After      the reading section 3 has finished reading data from the magnetic stripe      of the boarding pass 19 fed from the feeding section 20, the second gate      valve 42 is released from the operative position to the rest position, and      the conveyor belts 71A and 71B are stopped. The pair of feeding rollers 17      nearest to the inlet port 2 are restarted after the control process for      discharging the boarding pass 19. </PAR><PAR>  As described above, in this embodiment, the inserted boarding pass 19 is      normally fed to the reading section 3 through the main feeding path 21 by      means of the feeding rollers 17. The orientation of the inserted boarding      pass 19 is detected by checking which one of the magnetic sensors 31 to 34      has generated a detection signal, and if it is inserted in the wrong      orientation, the boarding pass 19 is removed from the main feeding path 21      by means of the direction detecting section 40, rotated by the rotating      section 50 if necessary, and is returned to the main feeding path 21 by      means of the sub-feeding section 70. In this way, the control section 107      adequately controls the elements 20, 30, 40, 50 and 70 to automatically      correct the orientation of the boarding pass 19 and supply the boarding      pass 19 in the correct orientation even if the boarding pass 19 is      inserted in any orientation. </PAR><PAR>  In this case, the reading device does not require two or more reading heads      4 which are precision parts. Therefore, it is possible to solve a problem      of an increase in the manufacturing cost and difficulty in reducing the      size of the reading device caused by an increase in the number of the      heads. Further, a single reading head 4 can be easily adjusted. In      addition, a special process for compensating for the characteristics of      the heads can be made unnecessary. </PAR><PAR>  Further, in this embodiment, the control section 107 is required only to      control the mechanical movements of the respective elements. </PAR><PAR>  Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled      in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited      to the specific details, and representative device shown and described      herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing      from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by      the appended claims and their equivalents. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
