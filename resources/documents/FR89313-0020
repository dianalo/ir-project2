Introduction</ITAG>In 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. sections 9601-9657 (CERCLA or ``the Act''),in response to the dangers of uncontrolled or abandoned hazardous wastesites. CERCLA was amended in 1986 by the Superfund Amendments and ReauthorizationAct (``SARA''), Pub. L. No. 99-499, 100 Stat. 1613 <T3>et seq. </T3>To implement CERCLA, the Environmental Protection Agency(``EPA'' or ``the Agency'') promulgated the revised National Oil and HazardousSubstances Contingency Plan (``NCP''), 40 CFR Part 300, on July 16, 1982(47 FR 31180), pursuant to CERCLA section 105 and Executive Order 12316(46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). The NCP, further revised by EPA on September16, 1985 (50 FR 37624) and November 20, 1985 (50 FR 47912), sets forthguidelines and procedures needed to respond under CERCLA to releases andthreatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants.In response to SARA, EPA proposed revisions to the NCP on December 21,1988 (53 FR 51394).Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the NCPinclude criteria for ``determining priorities among releases or threatenedreleases throughout the United States for the purpose of taking remedialaction and, to the extent practicable taking into account the potentialurgency of such action, for the purpose of taking removal action.'' Removalaction involves cleanup or other actions that are taken in response toreleases or threats of releases on a short-term or temporary basis (CERCLAsection 101(23)). Remedial action tends to be long-term in nature and involvesresponse actions which are consistent with a permanent remedy for a release(CERCLA section 101(24)). Criteria for determining priorities for possibleremedial actions under CERCLA are included in the Hazard Ranking System(``HRS''), which EPA promulgated as Appendix A of the NCP (47 FR 31219,July 16, 1982).\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ EPA proposed major revisions to the HRS on December 23,1988 (53 FR 51962); however, the current HRS applies to the listing ofsites on the NPL until the revised HRS is finalized and takes effect. CERCLAsection 105(c)(1). Section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, requires that the statutorycriteria provided by the HRS be used to prepare a list of national prioritiesamong the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances,pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United States. The list, whichis Appendix B of the NCP, is the National Priorities List (``NPL''). Section105(a)(8)(B) also requires that the NPL be revised at least annually. A site can undergo CERCLA-financed remedial action only after it is placedon the final NPL as provided in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(c)(2) and 300.68(a).Although Federal facility sites are eligible for the NPL pursuant to theNCP at 40 CFR 300.66(c)(2), section 111(e)(3) of CERCLA, as amended bySARA, limits the expenditure of Superfund monies at Federally-owned facilities.Federal facility sites also are subject to the requirements of CERCLA section120, added by SARA.This notice announces the Agency's policy of including on the NPL Federalfacility sites that meet the eligibility requirements (e.g., an HRS scoreof 28.50), even if such facilities are also subject to the corrective actionauthorities of Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act(``RCRA''), 42 U.S.C. 6901-6991(i). Elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register </T4>EPA is adding Federal facility sites to the NPLin conformance with this policy.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Development of the Policy for Listing Federal Facility Sites </ITAG>CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) directs EPA to list priority sites ``among''the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants,or contaminants, and section 105(a)(8)(A) directs EPA to consider certainenumerated and ``other appropriate'' factors in doing so. Thus, as a matterof policy, EPA has the discretion not to use CERCLA to respond to certaintypes of releases. When the initial NPL was promulgated (48 FR 40662, September 8, 1983),the Agency announced certain listing policies relating to sites that mightqualify for the NPL. One of these policies was that RCRA land disposalunits that received hazardous waste after July 26, 1982 (the effectivedate of the RCRA land disposal regulations) would generally not be includedon the NPL. On April 10, 1985 (50 FR 14117), the Agency announced thatit was considering revisions to that policy based upon new authoritiesof the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (``HSWA'') that allowthe Agency to require corrective action at solid waste management unitsof RCRA facilities in addition to regulated hazardous waste managementunits. On June 10, 1986 (51 FR 21057), EPA announced several components of a finalpolicy for placing RCRA-regulated sites on the NPL, but made clear thatthe policy applied only to non-Federal sites. The Policy stated that thelisting of non-Federal sites with releases that can be addressed underthe expanded RCRA Subtitle C corrective action authorities generally wouldbe deferred. However, certain RCRA sites at which Subtitle C correctiveaction authorities are available would generally be listed if they hadan HRS score of 28.50 or greater and met at least one of the followingcriteria:andbullet; Facilities owned by persons who have demonstrated an inabilityto finance a cleanup as evidenced by their invocation of the bankruptcylaws. andbullet; Facilities that have lost authorization to operate, and for whichthere are additional indications that the owner or operator will be unwillingto undertake corrective action. andbullet; Sites, analyzed on a case-by-case basis, whose owners or operatorshave a clear history of unwillingness to undertake corrective action.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ On August 9, 1988 (53 FR 30002/30005), EPA published additionalinformation on Agency policy concerning criteria to determine if an owneror operator is unwilling or unable to undertake corrective action. On June 10, 1986 (51 FR 21059), EPA stated that it would consider at alater date whether this revised policy for deferring non-Federal RCRA-regulatedsites from the NPL should apply to Federal facilities. On October 17, 1986, SARA took effect, adding a new section 120 to CERCLAdevoted exclusively to Federal facilities. Section 120 explains the applicabilityof CERCLA to the Federal Government, and generally sets out a scheme underwhich contaminated Federal facility sites should be included in a specialdocket, evaluated, placed on the NPL (if HRS scores so warrant), and addressedpursuant to an Interagency Agreement with EPA. As part of its deliberations on a Federal facilities listing policy, EPAconsidered pertinent sections of SARA and the proposed policy concerningRCRA corrective action at Federal facilities with RCRA-regulated hazardouswaste management units (51 FR 7722, March 5, 1986). Specifically, thatpolicy stated that:andbullet; RCRA section 3004(u) subjects Federal facilities to correctiveaction requirements to the same extent as privately-owned or -operatedfacilities. andbullet; The definition of a Federal facility boundary is equivalent tothe property-wide definition of facility at privately-owned or -operatedfacilities.The Agency determined that the great majority of Federal facility sitesthat could be placed on the NPL have RCRA-regulated hazardous waste managementunits within the Federal facility property boundaries, subjecting themto RCRA corrective action authorities. Therefore, application to Federalfacilities of the March 5, 1986 boundary policy and the June 10, 1986 RCRAdeferral policy would result in placing very few Federal facility siteson the NPL. However, CERCLA and its legislative history indicate that Congressclearly intended that Federal facility sites generally be placed on theNPL and addressed under the process set out in CERCLA section 120(e). Thus,EPA concluded that the RCRA deferral policy applicable to private sitesmight not be appropriate for Federal facilities. On May 13, 1987 (52 FR17991), the Agency announced that it was considering adopting a policyfor listing Federal facility sites that are eligible for the NPL, evenif they are also subject to the corrective action authorities of SubtitleC of RCRA; public comment was specifically requested on this approach.Congress' intent that Federal facility sites should be on the NPL, evenif RCRA corrective action authorities apply, is evidenced by the natureof the comprehensive system of site identification and evaluation set upby CERCLA section 120, added by SARA. First, in section 120(c), EPA isrequired to establish a ``Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket,''based on information submitted under sections 103 and 120(b) of CERCLA,<T3>and </T3>sections 3016, 3005, and 3010 of RCRA.\3\<NOTE/> Thus, the docket is based heavily on information providedby Federal facilities that are subject to RCRA. If Congress had intendedthat Federal facilities subject to RCRA authorities should not also beexamined under the Federal facility provisions of CERCLA, then the legislatorswould not have directed EPA to develop a docket of facilities (for evaluation<T3>under CERCLA</T3>) composed largely of Federal facilities subject toRCRA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Section 3016 of RCRA provides for the inventory of Federalsites where RCRA hazardous waste ``is stored, treated, or disposed of orhas been disposed of at any time''; section 3005 of RCRA requires the filingof information necessary for the issuance of permits (or the obtainingof interim status) to treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste underRCRA; and RCRA section 3010 requires notifications that a RCRA hazardouswaste is being generated, transported, treated, stored, or disposed of.Second, the Agency is also directed, in CERCLA section 120(d), to ``takesteps to assure that a preliminary assessment is conducted <T3>for each facility on the docket</T3>,'' and where appropriate, to includesuch facilities on the NPL if the facility meets ``the criteria establishedin accordance with section 105 under the National Contingency Plan fordetermining priorities among releases.'' (EPA does apply the CERCLA section105 criteria_the Hazard Ranking System (HRS)_to Federal, as well as private,sites.) Here again, if Congress had intended that Federal facilities subjectto RCRA authorities not be placed on the NPL, then the legislators wouldnot have required EPA to evaluate for the NPL all Federal facilities inthe docket_the large majority of which are subject to RCRA authorities.Third, Congress set up the Interagency Agreement (IAG) process (CERCLAsection 120(e) (2)-(4)) to evaluate the need for cleanups of Federal facilitysites. If all Federal facility sites subject to RCRA Subtitle C were deferredfrom listing and attention under CERCLA, few Federal sites would come withinthe IAG process, contrary to Congressional intent. Rather, Congress intended that EPA list, and evaluate in the IAG process,all Federal facility sites that are eligible for the NPL, including thosefacilities subject to RCRA Subtitle C authorities. As Senator Robert T.Stafford stated during the floor debate on section 120 of SARA (subsequentlysection 120 of CERCLA:<ITAG tagnum="21">[T]he amendments require a comprehensive nationwide effort to identifyand assess <T3>all</T3> Federal hazardous waste sites that warrant attention. 132Cong. Rec. S 14902 (daily ed., October 3, 1986) (emphasis added).</ITAG>EPA has long expressed the view that placing Federal facility sites onthe NPL serves an important informational function and helps to set prioritiesand focus cleanup efforts on those Federal sites that present the mostserious problems (50 FR 47931, November 20, 1985).EPA believes that today's decision not to apply the June 1986 NPL/RCRApolicy (for non-Federal sites) to Federal facilities is consistent withsection 120(a)(2) of CERCLA, which provides that ``all guidelines, rules,regulations and criteria which are applicable to * * * inclusion on theNational Priorities List, or applicable to remedial actions * * * shallalso be applicable to [Federal facilities].'' Given Congressional intentthat Federal facility sites should be included on the NPL, EPA interpretssection 120(a)(2) to mean that the criteria to list sites should not bemore exclusionary than the criteria to list non-Federal sites on the NPL.As discussed in the May 13, 1987, notice on the policy (52 FR 17992-3),most Federal facilities include RCRA-regulated hazardous waste managementunits and thus, almost all waste contamination areas within facility boundariesare subject to RCRA corrective action authorities; in addition, key exclusionsin the non-Federal RCRA deferral policy are not applicable to Federal facilities.Thus, if the non-Federal RCRA deferral policy were applied to Federal sites,very few Federal sites would be listed.The Agency believes that although section 120(a)(2) evidences Congress'intent that the Federal agencies comply with the same baseline of requirementsapplicable to private sites, the section does not require that all policiesand requirements applicable to private and Federal facility sites be identical.Indeed, Congress specifically set out a series of requirements which applyto Federal facilities in a manner different from, or in addition to, thoseapplicable to private sites, e.g., the preparation of a separate FederalAgency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket (section 120(c)); the notificationrequired before Federal agencies may transfer property (section 120(h));and the entire process for signing Interagency Agreements at Federal facilitysites (section 120(e) (2)-(4)).Just as Congress recognized that there are unique aspects of Federal facilitiesrequiring additional or special attention in the contexts just named, specialattention is also required in deciding what listing/deferral policy shouldapply to Federal versus private sites. EPA's opinion is that significantdifferences inherent in the rules to which Federal facility sites and privatesites are subject under CERCLA and the NPL dictate that different listingand deferral policies should be crafted for each class of facilities.For private sites, the only legal significance of NPL listing is that thesite becomes eligible for <T3>Fund-financed</T3> remedial action, as provided in the NCP at 40 CFR300.66(c)(2) and 300.68(a)(1) (removal actions and enforcement actionscan be taken at private sites regardless of NPL status). Indeed, EPA recentlysuggested in the preamble to proposed revisions to the NCP (53 FR 51416,December 21, 1988) that it may be appropriate to view the non-Federal NPL``as a list for informing the public of hazardous waste sites that appearto warrant * * * remedial action through CERCLA funding along.'' This relationshipbetween the NPL and the availability of Fund monies (at private sites)is a central factor behind EPA's deferral policies. EPA has concluded thatby deferring to other statutes like RCRA, ``a maximum number of potentiallyhazardous waste sites can be addressed and EPA can direct its CERCLA efforts(and Fund monies, if necessary) to those sites where remedial action cannotbe achieved by other means'' (53 FR 51415, December 21, 1988). However,this goal of maximizing the use of limited Fund monies does not apply toFederal facility sites.Federal facility sites on the NPL are not eligible for <T3>Fund-financed</T3> remedial actions (except in the very limited casesdescribed in CERCLA section 111(e)(3)), pursuant to the NCP at 40 CFR 300.66(c)(2).Thus, the deferral of Federal facility sites from the NPL would not resultin significant economies to the Fund, although it could do harm to theinformational and management goals of including Federal facility siteson the NPL, as well as Congressional intent. Although the Agency mighthave decided to defer Federal facility sites subject to RCRA based on adesire to avoid duplication in remedial actions (another of the purposesbehind RCRA deferral for private sites), EPA has concluded that this goalmay be accomplished satisfactorily for Federal facilities through the process,set out in CERCLA section 120 (e)(2)-(e)(4), of developing comprehensiveIAGs. As discussed in detail below, EPA will attempt to use the IAG processto achieve efficient, comprehensive solutions to site problems, and whereappropriate, to divide responsibilities for cleanup among the various applicableauthorities.Finally, the deferral of Federal facility sites to RCRA-authorized States,in lieu of evaluation under the IAG process, may be inconsistent with theintent of CERCLA section 120(g), which provides that ``no authority vestedin the [EPA] Administrator under this section [120] may be transferred''to any person. 42 U.S.C. 9620(g).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Coordination of Response Authorities at Federal Facility Siteson the NPL</ITAG>EPA recognizes that when it takes action under CERCLA to address a facilitythat is also subject to RCRA authorities, there is some risk of overlapor even conflict. Such conflict situations are not a problem where EPAis responsible for carrying out the requirements of both RCRA and CERCLA(since any jurisdictional overlaps can be managed within EPA). However,an overlap of authority may yield disagreements as to how a site shouldbe cleaned up where a State has been authorized to carry out all or partof the RCRA program.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ EPA recognizes that many States have hazardous waste lawsindependent of that upon which the State's authorized RCRA program maybe based. Although this policy statement focuses primarily on the mechanismfor applying RCRA (by EPA or authorized States) to Federal facilities onthe NPL, the same analysis would apply to non-RCRA State laws that potentiallyoverlap with CERCLA response authorities.However, this potential overlap between RCRA and CERCLA cleanup authoritiesis the result of Congressional design, not site listings. EPA neither intendsnor believes that site listings themselves create a conflict between CERCLAand RCRA (or State law); rather, any conflict stems from the overlap ofthe corrective action authorities of the two statutes. The overlap existswhenever EPA takes CERCLA action at a site that has regulated hazardouswaste management units subject to a State's RCRA program or other Statelaw. EPA can take such CERCLA actions at sites <T3>not</T3> on the NPL as well as at sites on the NPL.\5\<NOTE/> (Such conflicts may also occur at private sites as well asat Federal facility sites.) There may also be cases where the applicabilityof both RCRA and CERCLA authorities at NPL sites does <T3>not</T3> create a conflict_for example, where the RCRA hazardous wastemanagement units are not included within the area to be addressed underCERCLA, or where the release is exempt from action under RCRA. Thus, conflictbetween RCRA and CERCLA corrective actions can occur at virtually any pointin the process or not at all.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Removal actions, as well as remedial actions ordered undersection 106 of CERCLA, may be taken at non-NPL sites. <T3>See</T3> 40 CFR 300.66(c)(2) and 300.68(a)(1).How RCRA authorities are affected (if at all) when CERCLA also appliesto a site is a matter that varies greatly, depending upon the facts ofthe site. In some cases, the NPL site is physically distinct from the RCRA-regulatedhazardous waste management units, and corrective action or closure at theregulated units may proceed under RCRA, while at the same time a cleanupaction is proceeding at another area of the property under CERCLA, withoutthe risk of inconsistency or duplication of response action. In other cases,the releases or contaminant plumes may overlap, such that a comprehensivesolution under one statute may be the most efficient and desirable solution.The questions of which authority should control, and of how to avoid potentialduplication or inconsistency, are often implementation issues, to be resolvedin light of the facts of the case and after consultation between EPA andthe concerned State.EPA's belief is that in most situations, it is appropriate to address sitescomprehensively under CERCLA, pursuant to an enforceable agreement (i.e.,an IAG under CERCLA section 120), signed by the Federal facility, EPA,<T3>and</T3>, where possible, the State. In some circumstances, it maybe appropriate under an IAG to divide responsibilities, focusing CERCLAactivity only on certain prescribed units, leaving the cleanup of otherunits under the direct control of RCRA authorities, such as where the RCRA-regulatedhazardous waste management unit is physically distinct from the CERCLAcontamination and its cleanup would not disrupt CERCLA activities. Alternatively,the IAG can prescribe divisions of responsibility, such as stating thatCERCLA will address ground water contamination while RCRA will addressthe closure of regulated hazardous waste management units. Any disagreementsin the implementation of the IAG would be resolved by the signatory partiesunder the dispute resolution terms of the IAG.Of course, there may be cases where a RCRA-authorized State declines tojoin the IAG process, or agreement on the terms of an IAG cannot be achieved.For instance, State officials may decide that the proper closure of a landfillshould be accomplished through excavation, while CERCLA officials may determinethat the same area should be managed differently as part of a comprehensiveCERCLA action at the site. Although EPA will try to resolve any such conflictsand achieve agreement with the State in the IAG process, there may be caseswhere the conflicting views of EPA and the State concerning correctiveaction cannot be resolved.CERCLA section 122(e)(6), entitled ``inconsistent response actions,'' givesspecific guidance on this point:<ITAG tagnum="21">INCONSISTENT RESPONSE ACTION._When either the President, or a potentiallyresponsible party pursuant to an administrative order or consent decreeunder this Act, has initiated a remedial investigation and feasibilitystudy [RI/FS] for a particular facility under this Act, no potentiallyresponsible party may undertake any remedial action at the facility unlesssuch remedial action has been authorized by the President.</ITAG>As the Conference Report on SARA noted, section 122(e)(6) was includedin the bill ``to clarify that no potentially responsible party [PRP] mayundertake any remedial action at a facility unless such remedial actionhas been authorized by the President'' (or his delegate, EPA)\6\<NOTE/>. <T3>See</T3> H.R. Rep. 962, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. at 254 (1986). <T3>See also</T3> 132 Cong. Rec. S14919 (daily ed., October 3, 1986) (``Thisis to avoid situations in which the PRP begins work at a site that prejudgesor may be inconsistent with what the final remedy should be or exacerbatesthe problem.'')\7\<NOTE/> This authorization requirement applies to any remedial actionstaken by a PRP, including those actions ordered by a State, as both typesof action could be said to present a potential conflict with a CERCLA-authorizedaction.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The authority under section 122(e)(6) to authorize a remedialaction to continue after the initiation of an RI/FS at an NPL site hasbeen delegated to the EPA Administrator. <T3>See</T3> Executive Order 12580, section 4(d)(1) (52 FR 2923, January29, 1987). For most non-NPL sites, the general authority for carrying outthe requirements of CERCLA section 122 has been delegated to the Federalagencies for sites under their jurisdiction or control; however, the abilityof the Federal agencies to authorize sites under section 122(e)(6) is limitedby the provisions of section 120(a)(4), as discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Congress' intent that CERCLA actions should proceed withoutpotential conflict with other remedial action is also suggested by thelanguage in section 7002(b)(2)(B) of RCRA, which states that RCRA citizensuits alleging an imminent and substantial endangerment may <T3>not</T3> be brought if EPA: has commenced an action under CERCLA section106 (or RCRA 7003); is engaging in a removal action under CERCLA section104; or has incurred costs to begin an RI/FS under CERCLA and is diligentlyproceeding with remedial action; or has obtained a court order (includinga consent decree) or issued an administrative order under CERCLA section106 or RCRA section 7003, and a responsible party is diligently conductinga removal, an RI/FS, or proceeding with remedial action pursuant to thatorder. Similarly, RCRA section 1006(b) directs the Administrator to ``integrateall provisions of [RCRA] for purposes of administration and enforcementand shall avoid duplication to the maximum extent practicable,'' with appropriateprovisions of laws (such as CERCLA) granting regulatory authority to EPA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ ``Remedial action'' is very broadly defined in section101(24) of CERCLA as actions consistent with a permanent remedy at a site,including confinement of a release of hazardous substances, cleanup ofhazardous substances, etc. EPA believes that remedial actions within themeaning of the term may include those taken under statutes other than CERCLA,including corrective action under RCRA.CERCLA section 122(e)(6) does not constitute a prohibition on RCRA correctiveaction at CERCLA sites; rather, it provides a mechanism by which the Agencymust approve of remedial actions commenced at sites after an RI/FS hasbeen initiated under CERCLA. Such an approach would help to avoid duplicativeand wasteful cleanup actions. This authorization mechanism would not affectnormal hazardous waste management requirements under RCRA, such as complyingwith manifest, 90-day storage, and labeling requirements; any RCRA-regulatedhazardous waste management units operating at a CERCLA site must continueto comply with RCRA hazardous waste management requirements, even if aCERCLA response action is underway. The Agency also intends to authorizemany State RCRA actions to continue, e.g., where the RCRA action addressesa unit distinct from the CERCLA contamination, and where the RCRA actionwill not disrupt CERCLA activities.Even where EPA decides that it is not appropriate to authorize a RCRA orother State action to continue under CERCLA section 122(e)(6) in orderto avoid disruption or duplicative actions, CERCLA section 120(f) specificallyprovides that participation by State officials in remedy selection ``shallbe provided in accordance with section 121,'' and CERCLA section 121(d)specifically provides a process for taking account of ``applicable or relevantand appropriate requirements'' (ARARs) of RCRA (as well as other Stateand Federal statutes) when a remedy is selected. If any State requirementsare waived pursuant to CERCLA section 121(d)(4), the affected State mayobtain judicial review of such waiver, and even if unsuccessful, may ensurethat those requirements are met by providing the necessary additional fundingpursuant to CERCLA section 121(f)(3)(B). As the Agency has noted repeatedlyin the past, ``it is EPA's expectation that remedies selected and implementedunder CERCLA will generally satisfy the RCRA corrective action requirements,and vice versa'' (52 FR 17993, May 13, 1987, and 52 FR 27645, July 22,1987).\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ To the extent that this policy may be read as inconsistentwith the district court's opinion in <T3>State of Colorado v. U.S. Department of the Army,</T3> C.A. No. 86-C-2524(D. Colo., February 24, 1989), EPA disagrees with that opinion.The discretion under CERCLA section 122(e)(6) not to authorize a PRP togo forward with a remedial action at a site after a CERCLA remedial investigation/feasibilitystudy (RI/FS) has begun_even if that action has been ordered by a State_isgenerally available at both private and Federal facility sites. However,CERCLA section 120(a)(4) provides that State laws shall apply to remedialactions_including those under CERCLA _at <T3>Federal facility</T3> sites that are <T3>not</T3> on the NPL, thus, acting as a general limitation on the moregeneral section 122(e)(6).\1\\0\<NOTE/> Of course, no such limitation applies to Federal facilitysites once they are placed on the NPL.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ Section 120(a)(4) states as follows: State laws concerningremoval and remedial action, including State laws regarding enforcement,shall apply to removal and remedial action at facilities owned or operatedby a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States when suchfacilities are <T3>not</T3> included on the National Priorities List.

Indeed, an RI/FS maybe commenced prior to, as well as after, NPL listing.\11\<NOTE/> This is especially true for Federal facility sites, as thePresident has delegated his authority to take CERCLA section 104 responseactions (including RI/FSs) to the Federal agencies for most non-NPL sites(Executive Order 12580, at section 2(e)(1)).\12\<NOTE/> Thus, when a Federal facility is placed on the NPL, an RI/FSwill often have been commenced (or completed). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ <T3>See SCA Services of Indiana, Inc. v. Thomas,</T3> 634 F.Supp. 1355,1381 (W.D. Ind. 1986) (``CERCLA clearly makes the conduct of an RI/FS aremoval, not remedial, action, so that the restriction that remedial actionsbe taken only when the site is on the NPL is simply irrelevant to a RI/FS'');52 FR 27622 (July 22, 1987) (``an RI/FS can be performed at proposed [NPL]sites pursuant to the Agency's removal authority under CERCLA''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Section 104 authorities were delegated to the Departmentsof Defense and Energy more generally, although such functions must stillbe exercised consistent with the requirements of section 120 of CERCLA.Executive Order 12580, section 2(d). In order to invoke the authorization mechanism of CERCLA section 122(e)(6),EPA must make a threshold determination of whether or not an RI/FS ``underthis Act [CERCLA]'' has been initiated; studies conducted by Federal facilitiesbefore a site has been placed on the NPL may or may not constitute an appropriateRI/FS in EPA's opinion.\13\<NOTE/> As a matter of policy, the Agency will generally interpretCERCLA-quality RI/FSs to be those that are provided for, or adopted byreference, in an IAG. The Agency believes that such a policy is consistentwith CERCLA section 120(e)(1), which directs Federal facilities, ``in consultationwith EPA,'' to commence an RI/FS within six months of the facility's listingon the NPL. In addition, the policy will promote consistency in RI/FS's,and will help to ensure that all appropriate information has been collectedduring the RI/FS, so that EPA may properly evaluate remedial alternativesat Federal facility sites as required under CERCLA section 120(e)(4). Further,by encouraging the development of IAGs at the early RI/FS stage, this policymay help to promote coordination among the parties, and avoid inconsistentactions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ ``RI/FS'' is a term of art under CERCLA, and appliesto a special site study and evaluation pursuant to section 300.68(d) ofthe NCP. EPA, as the agency entrusted with the development and implementationof the NCP, is the recognized expert on what constitutes an acceptableRI/FS under CERCLA. Thus, the IAG will generally commit the Federal facility to complete bothan RI/FS and any subsequent remedial action determined by EPA to be necessary.Once an RI/FS has been commenced under (or incorporated into) an IAG, EPAmust decide whether or not to authorize PRPs to continue with any non-CERCLAremedial actions (both voluntary and State-ordered) at the site. This decisionwill be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the status ofCERCLA activities at the site, and the potential for disruption of or conflictwith that work if the PRP action were authorized. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Response to Public Comments </ITAG>On May 13, 1987 (52 FR 17991), EPA solicited public comment on the Agency'sintention to adopt a policy for including eligible Federal facility siteson the NPL, even if they are also subject to RCRA corrective action authorities;the Agency received six comments on the policy. EPA considered the commentsraised, and responds to them as follows. Two of the six commenters concur with the policy to include eligible Federalfacility sites on the NPL and have no suggested revisions or additionalcomments. One commenter ``generally supports'' the policy, but believes that thecriteria used to list Federal facility sites are unclear. The commenterstates that ``as written, the proposed policy could be interpreted to meanthat Federal hazardous facilities would be placed on the NPL regardlessof their status under [RCRA] or their degree of actual hazard.'' In response, the commenter is correct in concluding that under the policy,Federal facility sites would be placed on the NPL regardless of the facility'sstatus under RCRA. As discussed above, this is consistent with Congressionalintent that Federal facility sites should be on the NPL, and that listingcriteria should not be applied to Federal sites in a manner that is moreexclusionary than for private sites. However, the commenter is incorrectin suggesting that Federal facility sites will be listed regardless ofthe degree of hazard they present. The Agency intends to use the HRS, thesame method used for non-Federal sites, to determine whether a Federalfacility site poses an actual or potential threat to health or the environmentand, therefore, qualifies for the NPL. (Currently, a site is generallyeligible for the NPL if the HRS score is 28.50 or greater.) The applicationof the HRS to Federal facility sites is consistent with CERCLA section120(d), which requires EPA to use the HRS in evaluating for the NPL thefacilities on the Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket. One commenter did not comment on the policy, but rather is concerned thatno Superfund monies be spent at Federal facilities. The commenter believesthat neither pre-remedial work (preliminary assessments and site inspections)nor remedial work should be financed by the Trust Fund. In response, Executive Order 12580 (52 FR 2923, January 29, 1987), at section2(e), delegates the responsibility for conducting most pre-remedial workto the Federal agencies. Therefore, the Federal agencies, rather than theTrust Fund, finance these activities, with EPA providing oversight. Inaddition, section 111(e)(3) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, strictly limitsthe use of the Fund for remedial actions at Federally-owned facilities.Although the Administrator does have the discretion to use funds from theHazardous Substances Superfund to pay for emergency removal actions forreleases or threatened releases from Federal facilities, the concernedExecutive Agency or department must reimburse the Fund for such costs.Executive Order 12580, section 9(i). The Department of Defense and theDepartment of Energy also have response authority for emergency removals(Executive Order, section 2(d)).Another commenter opposes the policy of placing RCRA-regulated Federalfacilities on the NPL, arguing that public notification is adequately addressedby other provisions of CERCLA (sections 120 (b), (c), and (d)), and thatthe policy is inconsistent with section 120(a), which requires that Federalfacilities comply with CERCLA in the same manner as any nongovernmentalentity. The commenter believes that the adoption of the proposed policyis inconsistent with EPA's policy regarding non-Federal facilities.In response, CERCLA sections 120 (b), (c), and (d) refer to the establishmentof the Federal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket and to the evaluationof facilities on the docket for the NPL.14<NOTE/> The Agency agrees that this docket will provide the publicwith some information regarding hazardous waste activities at Federal facilities,as well as information concerning contamination of contiguous or adjacentproperty. The Agency believes, however, that evaluating sites using theHRS, and placing on the NPL those sites that pose the most serious problems,will serve to inform the public of the relative hazard of these sites.The listing process also affords the public the opportunity to examineHRS documents and references for a particular site, and to comment on aproposed listing. In addition, the NPL provides response categories andcleanup status codes for sites, and deletes sites when no further responseis required, adding to the informational benefits of using the NPL. Therefore,EPA believes that listing Federal facility sites will advise the publicof the status of Federal government cleanup efforts, as well as help Federalagencies set priorities and focus cleanup efforts on those sites that presentthe most serious problems, consistent with the NCP (50 FR 47931, November20, 1985).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>14Pursuant to section 120(c) of CERCLA, EPA published theFederal Agency Hazardous Waste Compliance Docket on February 12, 1988 (53FR 4280). The docket was established based on information submitted byFederal agencies to EPA under sections 3005, 3010, and 3016 of RCRA andunder section 103 of CERCLA. The docket serves to identify Federal facilitiesthat must be evaluated in accordance with CERCLA section 120(d) to determineif they pose a risk to public health and the environment. Section 120(d)requires EPA to evaluate facilities on the docket using the HRS for possibleinclusion on the NPL.As to the comment concerning CERCLA section 120(a), EPA agrees that thesection provides that Federally-owned facilities are subject to and mustcomply with CERCLA to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity. Further,sections 120(a)(2) and 120(d) provide that EPA should use the same rulesand criteria to evaluate Federal sites for the NPL as are applied to privatesites. However, today's policy is not inconsistent with those sections.As a threshold matter, it is uncontroverted that an HRS score of 28.50or greater is an eligibility requirement for both Federal and private sites.The question is, should NPL-eligible Federal sites be deferred from listingas a matter of policy. As explained above, the Agency does not believethat CERCLA section 120(a)(2) can be read to require identical treatmentof Federal and private sites in all circumstances; the fact that Congresslegislated a number of requirements in addition to, or instead of, thoseapplicable to private facilities (e.g., sections 120 (c), (e)(2), (h)),demonstrates the legislators' recognition of the need to address certainunique aspects of Federal facilities differently than for private sites.Rather, EPA interprets CERCLA section 120(a) to mean that the criteriato list Federal facility sites should not be more exclusionary than thecriteria to list non-Federal sites. In this case, it is clear that if EPAwere to apply the non-Federal RCRA deferred listing policy to Federal facilities,very few Federal sites would be considered for the NPL, counter to thespirit and intent of section 120 (c) and (d) of CERCLA and the statute'slegislative history. Moreover, one of the key factors in EPA's decisionto adopt a RCRA deferral policy for private sites_the need to manage andconserve Fund resources_does not apply to Federal facilities because theremedies are not Fund-financed. EPA believes that it is appropriate, andconsistent with Congressional intent, to take these differences into account,as long as the result is not to treat Federal agencies in a more exclusionarymanner than private facilities.Two commenters expressed concern that listing Federal facility sites mightinterfere with enforcement activities under RCRA. One commenter statedthat the policy is inconsistent with CERCLA section 120(i), which requiresthat Federal facilities comply with all RCRA requirements. In response, the Agency's view is that today's policy will facilitate enforcementactivities at Federal facility sites, not interfere with them. In effect,by encouraging the drafting of comprehensive IAGs for Federal facilities,this policy will advance the goal of site remediation. In addition, theIAG process allows EPA to take steps to avoid duplication and conflict;the IAG may define areas of a Federal facility that may efficiently beaddressed under RCRA (e.g., units that are distinct from, and do not disrupt,CERCLA activities). In addition, States will be encouraged to become signatoryparties to IAGs, reducing the likelihood of intergovernmental conflictover jurisdiction and the selection of remedy. In any event, it is not the act of placing a site on the NPL that createsa potential conflict between CERCLA and RCRA; rather, the corrective actionauthorities of the two statutes overlap, pursuant to statutory design.Indeed, the alleged interference with RCRA corrective actions by CERCLAcleanups can occur at any point in the process, depending upon the specificfacts of the case. In those cases where the relevant statutes do overlap,EPA believes that one of the statutes must sometimes be chosen for practicalreasons, and Congress has set out a procedure for resolving such conflictsin CERCLA section 122(e)(6).\1\\5\<NOTE/> However, the goal of today's policy is to minimize any suchconflicts through the IAG process. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\It is important to note that the section 122(e)(6) authorizationrequirement at Federal facilities is not triggered automatically by NPLlisting, but rather takes effect where an RI/FS has been initiated at alisted Federal site; as a matter of policy, this start-up point for theRI/FS will not be recognized in most cases until an enforceable IAG hasbeen signed, which may be well after a site is listed. The Agency acknowledges that in the case of Federal facilities, listingdoes have a significance not present for private sites. For instance, CERCLAsection 120(e)(2) provides that for Federal facility sites <T3>on the NPL</T3>, EPA will play a role in selecting remedies, whileCERCLA section 120(a)(4) provides that State laws concerning removal andremedial actions shall apply to Federal facilities when such facilitiesare not on the NPL (the section does not discuss how State laws apply atFederal sites that are on the NPL). However, any difference in EPA or Stateroles at NPL versus non-NPL Federal facility sites results from the statutoryscheme reflected in CERCLA sections 120(a)(4) and 121(d), and not fromthe act of listing itself. CERCLA directs EPA to list Federal sites onthe NPL and then specifies certain statutory consequences. Further, merely alleging that there may be some effect on State enforcementactions as a result of a policy of including Federal facilities on theNPL is not grounds for rejecting today's policy. The Agency has reviewedboth sides of the question, and has determined that it is in the best interestof the public and environmental protection to place Federal facility siteson the NPL and thus to make CERCLA authorities available to achieve comprehensiveremedies for contamination at such sites (when appropriate). In addition,the IAG process, as discussed in this policy, will serve to minimize duplicationand inconsistency with potential State orders. EPA also disagrees with the commenter's suggestion that today's policyis inconsistent with CERCLA section 120(i), which provides that ``nothingin this section [120] shall affect or impair the obligation of any department,agency, or instrumentality of the United States to comply with any requirementof the Solid Waste Disposal Act [RCRA] (including corrective action requirements).''EPA interprets that section simply to mean that section 120 does not impairotherwise applicable RCRA requirements; this mandate is met even if anaction is conducted under CERCLA, as CERCLA section 121(d)(2) specificallyprovides that ARARs of RCRA and State law must be achieved with regardto any on-site remedy. Even if a RCRA or State requirement that is an ARARis waived by EPA (section 121(d)(4)), the State may obtain judicial reviewof such a waiver, and even if unsuccessful, may require that the remedialaction conform to the requirement in question by paying the additionalcosts of meeting such standard (CERCLA section 121(f)(3)); thus, the intentof section 120(i) is satisfied. This interpretation of section 120(i) follows directly from the languageof the provision itself, which states that ``nothing in this section''_ascompared to ``nothing in this Act''_shall affect RCRA obligations. Thisleaves in place limitations contained in <T3>other </T3>sections of the statute, such as the permit waiver provision(section 121(e)); the process for selecting and waiving ARARs (sections121 (d)(2) and (d)(4)); and the ban on remedial actions not approved bythe President (section 122(e)(6)). For all these reasons, the Agency believes that today's Federal facilitieslisting policy is appropriate, that it reflects Congressional intent, andthat it is consistent with CERCLA. Pursuant to the policy described in this notice, the Agency will placeeligible Federal facility sites on the NPL even if the site is also subjectto the corrective action authorities of Subtitle C of RCRA. <ITAG tagnum="21">Date: March 6, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan Z.
