On the basis of the informationpresented at that meeting, AECB staff conducted a study of the accidentto ascertain its implications for the safety of CANDU nuclear reactorsand for the regulatory process in Canada. The conclusion of this reviewis that the accident at Chernobyl has not revealed any important newinformation which would have an effect on the safety requirements forCANDU reactors as presently applied by the AECB. All important aspectsof the accident and its causes have been considered by the AECB in thelicensing process for currently licensed reactors. However a number ofrecommendations are made with respect to aspects of reactor safety whichshould be re-examined in order to reinforce this conclusion.</TEXT></DOC>
