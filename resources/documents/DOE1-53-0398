Dynamic stiffness and damping ofbedrock were extracted from these experiments by applying the same methodto all experiments, and the characteristics of dynamic stiffness anddamping common to all sites were examined. Moreover, the applicabilityof the half-space elastic theory was also examined. It has been foundthat as for the dynamic stiffness of bedrock, the value estimated byusing the physical constants determined by seismic prospecting and applyingthe half-space elastic theory is generally appropriate. Further, thedamping of bedrock has a tendency to increase with the increase in frequency,as indicated by the half-space elastic theory.</TEXT></DOC>
