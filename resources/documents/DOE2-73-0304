The newly developedanalytical technique on ground stability by the results of the analyticalmethod for equivalent linear response was already reported. In this paper,the analytical method for nonlinear response to investigate into themore detailed behavior of ground due to strong earthquake motion is reported.In particular, the constitutive relation based on elastoplasticity wasnewly proposed in order to represent the deformation behavior duringcyclic loading, and the examples of its application to the response ofhorizontally leveled sandy ground to earthquake are described. The dialatancycharacteristics of soil are constituted by yield function, plastic potentialfunctioin and hardening function. The material constants in proposedconstitutive relation are easily determined by laboratory tests. One-dimensionalresponse analysis was conducted, using the constitutive relation.
