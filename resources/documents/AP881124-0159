About 4,000 people attended the service at the Cathedral of St.John the Divine. It symbolized a spiritual reconciliation betweendescendants of the Indians and generations of settlers who followedthe Pilgrims.   ``We are trying to awaken in the American people a sense ofresponsibility as parents of the next generation, a sense ofstewardship in the earth itself,'' said Chief Oren Lyons of theOnondaga Tribe in upstate New York.   Typically, Indians view Thanksgiving Day much differently thanthe people who took over their land.   ``In some parts of the country, they call Thanskgiving a day ofmourning _ to look about and see what's happened to the earth andsee how things have changed and what terrible circumstances we arein today,'' he said.   Upon entering the cathedral, people were handed sprigs of sage, asacred plant, from among 6,000 sprigs sent from Navajos innortheastern Arizona. Once inside, they were treated to the soundsof water drums, the instruments of the Ankle Deep singers from theOnondagas Tribe.   Representatives of 12 tribes were present, their deerskins andnative dress contrasting sharply with the tuxedos and suits of thePilgrim's descendants.   Organizers said they hoped that it and several other unrelatedservices held across the nation Thursday would help focus attentionagain on the true meaning of Thanksgiving, a notion that has beenblurred by the years since the Indians left the harvest table inPlymouth, Mass., in 1621.   Jim Buden, a trustee of the cathedral, said he hoped the servicewould help to resurrect the original intent of Thanksgiving, toallow Indians and the new settlers to celebrate the harvest together.   ``That has been lost,'' he said. ``The native Americans are nolonger part of the American Thanksgiving when, in fact, they werethe original co-celebrants.''</TEXT></DOC>
