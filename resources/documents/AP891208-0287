Nearly seven years after Disney Co. opened its Magic Kingdom inJapan, a host of U.S. companies are traveling the globe helping tobring theme parks and amusement facilities to a burgeoning middleclass looking for a good time.   ``What's happening abroad is what happened in the United Statesin the '70s with tremendous theme park construction,'' said ChrisMiles, design director at HHCP Leisure in Maitland, Fla., justnorth of Disney World and other Orlando-area parks.   ``With Asian countries becoming more affluent and Eastern Europeopening up, there are significant opportunities.''   Dozens of projects are under way in Europe and Asia, includingEuro Disneyland in France and Japan's $200 million Space Worldcomplex. Meanwhile, U.S. design firms continue to explore otherproposed ventures, ranging from a water park in Madrid tofuturistic thrill rides in South Korea.   In Japan alone, spending on amusement parks rose 9.4 percent to$2.2 billion last year, according to the Tokyo-based Leisure TimeDevelopment Center.   Theme park industry executives trace the beginnings of theoverseas boom to the early 1980s, when economies in the Far Eastand Europe began to improve.   ``It's a reflection of the economic changes in the world.Without a middle class, we don't have a business,'' said HughDarley, president of Orlando-based ITEC Productions Inc. and aformer Disney art director. ``It's not the country club crowd thatgoes to theme parks and the lower classes don't have the money tospend. Like in America, the middle class is our bread and butter.''   Darley said overseas projects comprise 60 percent of clients atITEC, which is working on an amusement-retail site in Switzerlandand a marine-mammal attraction in Japan.   Miles, who helped develop Disney's Epcot Center in Florida, saidhis company is involved in developing a sea park in Jedda, SaudiArabia; a carnival-type setting outside Istanbul, Turkey; and afantasy park in France based on the Smurf cartoon characters. Allare to open in the early 1990s.   ``In my opinion, the leading edge of leisure technology is goingon overseas,'' said Guy Sutton, executive vice president ofInternational Theme Park Services Inc., a Cincinnati-based designand consulting firm that has worked on parks in Singapore, Britainand France.   Most industry experts predict a trend toward robotics andattractions using sophisticated computers and high-definitiontelevision technology.   At the moment, Miles said the Europeans seem to enjoy morefantasy- and history-oriented themes, while Asians are dazzled byscientific wonders.   ``No matter what is to come, we'll still have to cater to theindividual tastes of the countries,'' said Sutton, who estimatedeven a modest theme park costs $75 million. ``You have to make itcomfortable for the local people.''   Generally, cuisine has the most hometown flavor. In Asia,vendors offer simple fare such as sausage and bread. The Frenchprefer croissants to cotton candy, and Spaniards search out theirregular afternoon snacks called tapas.   In lines, Asians tend to be more patient and comfortable inconfined places, while some Europeans grumble and fidget. Japaneseride operators are vigilant to tuck in loose-fitting kimonos.   ``There are a lot of cultural differences,'' said Darley. ``Butwhen you go deeper you find the 12-year-old in everyone, no matterif they're Swiss or Japanese. Fun is fun. It's a lot like U.S. filmoverseas. If they are good, people enjoy them.''   The International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractionsestimates there are more than 320 parks outside North America,ranging from dusty midways to the gleaming Tokyo Disney Land, whichdrew 13 million visitors last year.   In the United States, an estimated 254 million people visitedthe nearly 600 theme and amusement parks, said Peter Irish, aspokesman at the Alexandria, Va.-based trade group.   In Japan, where at least eight major amusement parks are underconstruction, the flagship is the giant Space World on the southernisland of Kyushu built by Shin-Nippon Steel, the nation's largeststeel company. The park _ equidistant from Tokyo and Seoul, SouthKorea _ will feature a simulated NASA astronaut training camp forchildren and a 60-by-90 foot theater.   Euro Disneyland is scheduled to open in 1992 and other proposalsinclude a theme park near Lisbon, Portugal, based on the pioneeringexpeditions of early seafaring explorers.   Irish noted that Latin American countries such as Mexico andBrazil have also increased construction of small amusement parks,but foreign investors remain skittish.   ``That's probably the next growth area,'' said Michael Hayes,marketing director of Cincinnati-based KZF Inc., which is designinga theme park on the French Riviera and a children's playland at theMadrid Zoo. ``If there's a time when the economic climate is rightdown there, we'll all be looking south.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Monday Dec. 11</NOTE></DOC>
