Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., had challenged the investment rule, saying it violated a state's authority to regulate the institutions it charters, and that the rule exceeded the agency's congressional authority to regulate state-chartered thrifts on a case-by-case basis.    In a decision Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell wrote that the Bank Board &quot;is fully authorized by statute to promulgate the . . . rule for protection of&quot; the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which the Bank Board oversees. The FSLIC insures thrift deposits up to $100,000.    Since February 1985 the Bank Board has limited the type and amount of equity investments that thrifts may make, arguing the failure of a thrift with large equity investments cost the FSLIC more money than the failure of one without equity investments.    Lincoln received attention early this year because of its connections with then-Bank Board member Lee Henkel, who had proposed a rule that could have effectively immunized Lincoln and another thrift from any enforcement actions in agency disputes. Mr. Henkel had a number of dealings with Lincoln; he resigned in April. Attorneys for Lincoln couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
