The meeting is scheduled for Oct. 16, the Kuwait News Agencysaid, but GCC officials, while acknowledging the ministers wouldmeet, declined to confirm the date.   Earlier reports had said the meeting would take place Sept. 17and 18.   KUNA said production by the 13-nation Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries and the restoration of quota discipline wouldbe key topics at the GCC talks in advance of an OPEC ministerialsession scheduled for Nov. 21 in Vienna.   The GCC includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United ArabEmirates, which are OPEC members, and Bahrain and Oman, which arenot.   KUNA said the four OPEC members would ``coordinate stands on anumber of issues of concern to OPEC ... especially with respect tothe future production level of OPEC and the necessity of memberstates adhering to individual production quotas to guaranteepreservation of stability of the official price per barrel of oilon the world market.''   Overall OPEC production in August was estimated at 20 millionbarrels a day, nearly 3.5 million barrels over its self-imposedoutput ceiling. This has helped depress prices below OPEC'sbenchmark of 18 dollars a barrel.   The U.A.E. has refused to accept a quota of 948,000 barrels aday and demanded a 1.5 million-barrel quota. That is about thelevel of its current production.   Kuwait, backed by Saudi Arabia, rejects Venezuela's wish to keepcondensate gases _ liquids condensed from natural gas duringproduction _ out of oil quotas.   The GCC group, along with other OPEC members, hope to settle theissue of production by Iraq and Iran now that their 8-year-old warhas ground to a halt.   Tehran has reportedly rejected proposals that Iran and Iraq beallotted equal production quotas in a bid to curb Iraq's unbridledoutput of around 2.8 million barrels a day.   Iraq has refused to accept a quota of 1.5 million barrels a dayand demanded parity with Iran's 2.3 million-barrel quota.   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto recently visited Baghdad andTehran and indicated that the issue could be solved through arevamped OPEC production policy aimed at pushing up oil prices toaround $18 a barrel.   Subroto has also visited other OPEC states, including Kuwait,Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and Qatar.</TEXT></DOC>
