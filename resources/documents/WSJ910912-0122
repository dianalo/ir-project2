Judge Thomas, in his second day of testimony before theSenate Judiciary Committee, insisted he hadn't changed hisviews and also resisted Democrats' continued efforts toelicit his opinion on Roe vs. Wade, the landmark 1973 SupremeCourt decision that recognized a constitutional right toabortion.</LP><TEXT>   Under sharp questioning by Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.),the nominee said he has never formed an opinion of any kindabout Roe vs. Wade and couldn't even recall discussing thecontroversial case in the 18 years since he graduated fromlaw school. Judge Thomas, who sits on the federal appealscourt here, reiterated that, in any case, he wouldn't commentdirectly on the abortion-rights issue because it would&quot;undermine&quot; his impartiality as a judge.   He did say that, if confirmed, he would keep an open mindon abortion cases and would rely on precedent and medicalscience in deciding them.   Expressing skepticism, Sen. Leahy indicated that he wouldcontinue to press the nominee on the issue. Republicans,meanwhile, charged that Judge Thomas was being held to atougher standard than Justice David Souter, who was easilyconfirmed last year despite his refusal to discuss Roe vs.Wade.   Overall, Judge Thomas maintained a calm demeanor underDemocratic fire, and at least one influential committeemember, Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), said he was&quot;pleased&quot; with his testimony on some issues. CommitteeChairman Joseph Biden of Delaware told the nominee, &quot;Do notcount me as one of your detractors because I ask you toughquestions.&quot;   Even the nominee's staunchest liberal opponents concededthat he went into the hearings a strong favorite to beconfirmed and probably could be defeated only if he blunderedbadly at the witness table. So far, at least, he hasn't.   Responding to questions on abortion, for example, heacknowledged the potential human toll of making the procedureillegal, as many of his conservative allies advocate. Herecalled that as a child he had heard &quot;hushed whispers&quot; aboutillegal abortions performed under unsafe conditions. &quot;On apersonal level,&quot; he added, &quot;I wouldn't want to see peoplesubjected to torture of that nature.&quot;   Aside from his own performance, Judge Thomas has benefitedfrom the difficult position in which his nomination has putliberals. Among his most controversial positions is thesteadfast opposition to most forms of racial preferences,which he turned into federal policy as chairman of the EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission during the 1980s. ButDemocrats have hesitated to raise race relations, apparentlybecause they don't relish criticizing a black man whoovercame segregation and poverty and bases his self-helpphilosophy on those compelling experiences.   It was a Republican, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, whopersistently questioned Judge Thomas yesterday on why hedoesn't favor broad affirmative-action policies to help movelarge numbers of blacks into the work force. The nomineeresponded that such policies lead to reverse discriminationagainst whites and other racial groups and also &quot;underminethe dignity&quot; of those who are helped.   Judge Thomas instead stressed that individual cases ofdiscrimination deserved government attention and thatemployers found guilty of purposeful bias should face tougherpunishment, including potential jail terms andmultimillion-dollar criminal fines.   In an earlier exchange with Sen. DeConcini, the nomineesaid somewhat enigmatically that for some types ofdiscrimination, he might endorse a &quot;more exacting&quot; level ofanalysis than is now employed by the Supreme Court. JudgeThomas didn't elaborate on when he would consider such a&quot;ratcheting up&quot; of the high court's discrimination test,making it easier to prove illegal bias.   Responding to questions from Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.),Judge Thomas made his first comments on another issue thatcomes before the Supreme Court frequently, prayer in school.The nominee said that a policy that resulted in a student'sbeing excluded from any activity because of religion &quot;shouldbe considered inappropriate.&quot;   The issue Democrats pursued with enthusiasm was whetherJudge Thomas has been conveniently disavowing past statementsand positions to improve his chances of being confirmed. Sen.Howell Heflin (D., Ala.) noted &quot;an appearance of confirmationconversion,&quot; a clear reference to the 1987 defeat of RobertBork, a Supreme Court nominee of former President Reagan.Some Democrats charged four years ago that Mr. Bork hadundergone such a conversion when he tried to temper some ofhis controversial views, and the accusation helped doom hisnomination.   Sen. Heflin, who provided a key vote against Mr. Bork,said a confirmation conversion raised the issue of anominee's &quot;integrity and temperament&quot; to sit on the SupremeCourt.   Specifically, the Alabama lawmaker questioned whetherJudge Thomas had backed off his earlier endorsements ofnatural law. This somewhat esoteric legal philosophy, whichhas become a central issue in the Thomas hearings, assumesthe existence of certain fundamental rights, such as libertyand equality, regardless of whether those rights are includedin written laws.   In response to questions from several Democrats, JudgeThomas has tried to soften and clarify some of hisnatural-law beliefs. For example, he has distanced himselffrom natural-law thinkers who would declare abortionunconstitutional or assert property rights as a means ofrolling back government regulation of business. But thenominee insisted yesterday that he wasn't abandoning naturallaw altogether; instead, he stressed that he views it as moreof a political theory than a basis for decidingconstitutional cases.   It wasn't clear whether this answer completely satisfiedSen. Heflin. But the lawmaker eventually qualified his attackby acknowledging that Judge Thomas's past pronouncements onnatural law were &quot;subject to interpretation.&quot; Sen. Heflinalso said he hadn't decided how he would vote on thenomination.   ---   Raquel Santiago contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
