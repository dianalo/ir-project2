The tool is based on this premise: as the adversary acts,he or she creates a set of facts that can be detected by safeguards components.Whenever an adversary's planned set of actions create a set of factswhich the security personnel would consider irregular or unusual, wecan improve the security system by implementing safeguards that detectthose facts. Therefore, an intelligent computer program can suggest upgradesto the facility if we construct a knowledge base that contains informationabout: (1) the facts created by each possible adversary action, (2) thefacts that each possible safeguard can detect, and (3) groups of factswhich will be considered irregular whenever they occur together. Theauthors describe the structure of the knowledge base and show how theabove information can be represented in it. They also describe the proceduresthat a computer program can use to identify missing or weak safeguardsand to suggest upgrades.</TEXT></DOC>
