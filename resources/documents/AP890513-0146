(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Shouting and clapping, about 150relatives and supporters of laid-off police, firefighters andrescue workers in this city marched to the mayor's house Saturdayto demand his recall.   Some marchers pushed babies in strollers or walked dogs dressedin union T-shirts. Most demonstrators wore black T-shirts reading,``R.I.P. Elizabeth. She was a Proud Lady. Shot in the Back by MayorThomas G. Dunn.''   ``This is to show him how many people this is affecting,'' saidNancy Munnings, who helped organize the protest at Dunn's house andwhose husband, Robert, is to be laid off May 31.   She said the layoffs in this New Jersey city near New York were``affecting children and families and the officers who remain whowon't have their backups. That's what we're trying to show himtoday. No husbands allowed.''   Dunn did not appear to be home.   Saturday's protest was made possible when Superior Court JudgeEdward W. Beglin on Friday refused to extend a restraining orderprohibiting protests at Dunn's home. The order was issued lastmonth after a crowd of police officers, firefighters and ambulanceworkers vandalized Dunn's house during a protest.   On April 14, Dunn laid off 67 police officers, 53 firefighters,and 24 emergency medical technicians, citing a budget shortfallbrought on by cuts in state aid and rising garbage disposal costs.   Thirty-four more police officers and another 29 firefightingjobs are to be cut May 31, said Paul Partanza, president of thePolice Benevolent Association of Elizabeth.   The police and the others contend Dunn's action has severelycompromised the city's ability to control crime and handleemergencies.   After the first wave of layoffs last month, laid-off workers andsupporters started a campaign to recall Dunn.</TEXT></DOC>
