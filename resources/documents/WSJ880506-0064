Part of the decline stemmed from a strong year-earlier period, when Easter fell in April and boosted sales. But taking that into account, analysts still believed that most stores fell below their sales targets last month, reflecting persistent weakness in women's apparel, unseasonably cool weather in the Northeast and West and continued aggressive price-cutting.    Retailers said the cooler weather kept shoppers from thinking about spring clothes as well as about lawn, garden and patio equipment. In general, lower-priced variety stores and discounters performed better than apparel-oriented merchants.    The April results were &quot;somewhat distorted by the earlier celebration of Easter; nevertheless, sales were below retailers' budgeted expectations,&quot; said Jeffrey Feiner, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Group. Mr. Feiner predicted that many retailers' earnings for the fiscal first quarter ended April 30 will be flat to slightly lower as a result of weakness in sales of apparel and other soft goods.    &quot;The biggest issue is still lack of fashion (in women's apparel). . . .There's nothing new and exciting yet in the stores,&quot; said Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s Stacy Ruchlamer, who characterized the April results as &quot;worse than expected.&quot; However, she added, &quot;we can be hopeful (for improvement) in the second half of the year because retailers' inventory levels are in relatively good shape.&quot;    April sales comparisons for stores open more than a year declined virtually across the board. New York-based Mercantile Stores Co. fell 7.2%; Cincinnati-based Limited Inc. plunged 16%; Rocky Hill, Conn.based Ames Department Stores Inc. slid 4.8%; and Los Angeles-based Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. fell 4.4%.    Comparable-store sales also dipped 6.9% at Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp. But viewing combined March and April sales, Dayton Hudson noted results were &quot;very much in line with our expectations,&quot; with same-store sales up 2.3%.    The nation's largest retailer, Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. reported same-store sales fell 0.4% from a year earlier. At Dallas-based J.C. Penney Co., comparable-store sales sagged 0.9%, but the retailer cited men's apparel and catalog sales as &quot;very active.&quot; Penney expects May results will be &quot;soft compared to a year ago,&quot; when a credit promotion lifted sales.    Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said other factors also contributed to the declines, notably strong auto sales in April that &quot;might have taken away some of the thrust from general merchandise sales. . . .The consumer sector has been slowing over the last several quarters, and (April) sales reflect the general sluggishness we have seen in the last few quarters.&quot;    Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. was a notable exception to the slump suffered by the others; its April same-store sales rose 12%. &quot;Wal-Mart had a spectacular April, continuing to offer good quality merchandise at the lowest everyday prices,&quot; said Ms. Ruchlamer. Also, Troy, Mich.-based K mart Corp. experienced a domestic-stores sales gain of 2.4%, strengthened by results in home electronics and small appliances.    F.W. Woolworth Co. Chairman Harold E. Sells called the store's combined March and April performance &quot;strong,&quot; with sales up 12.5% over last year, buoyed by Kinney's shoe division and men's suits sales at its Richman store division. He predicted a pickup in apparel sales this fall.    Mr. Edelman also expects that &quot;new fashion colors&quot; will help bring some improvement in women's apparel sales this fall. Although there are some signs that inflation is heating up again, Mr. Edelman said he doesn't think it will be enough of a factor in retailing to affect sales.    ---                    Four-week April period                         a-'88 sales    '87 sales     b-%                            millions     millions     change    c-Sears ............... $1,994.4      1,945.9     + 2.5    K mart ................. 1,921.9      1,877.1     + 2.4    Wal-Mart ............... 1,580.0      1,201.0     +32.0    J.C.
