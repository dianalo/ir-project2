The action stemmed partly from the AmBase sale this weekof its Home Insurance Co. subsidiary for $970 million toSwedish investors, the Office of Thrift Supervision saidyesterday. The sale left AmBase, which had previouslypromised to keep Carteret properly capitalized, unable tomeet that agreement, the government said.</LP><TEXT>   Under a 1988 transaction, in which Carteret acquired afinance company from AmBase for $65 million, AmBase isrequired to make up the difference if Carteret resells thefinance company for less than $65 million. The current bookvalue for the finance company, Imperial Premium Finance Inc.,is $58 million, the thrift office said. Now that AmBase hassold its insurance company, government officials said, it hasfew liquid assets and wouldn't be able to honor theagreement.   As part of its insurance subsidiary sale this week, AmBasesaid that it infused $30 million of additional capital intoCarteret, which is based in Morristown, N.J. But the thriftoffice said that Carteret still fails one of several capitalrequirements it must meet.   Meanwhile, according to the thrift office, five AmBaseofficials, including Marshall Manley -- former president ofAmBase, who remained as a director until three weeks ago --received $11 million in severance agreements and loanforgiveness and bonuses.   The thrift office said that an administrative hearing willbe held in Morristown to determine whether &quot;correctiveaction, restitution, reimbursement&quot; should be ordered.   Several officials of Carteret and AmBase couldn't bereached yesterday for comment. The officials have 20 days torespond to the order.   Also, the thrift office said it was beefing up itsenforcement staff. It hired Therese DeVito Pritchard, whoprosecuted the Securities and Exchange Commission'senforcement actions against junk-bond dealer Michael Milkenand financier Ivan Boesky. The thrift office also hiredformer assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph A. Fisher III, one ofseveral federal attorneys who successfully prosecuted the$200 million mortgage-loan fraud case involving LandbankEquity Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
