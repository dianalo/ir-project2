Administration officials said that President Bush would formallysubmit to Congress within the next few days a request for authorityto negotiate an agreement dismantling barriers to the free flow ofgoods and investment between the two nations.   The administration's formal request starts a procedure in whichCongress has 60 legislative days, a period expected to last untillate spring, to review the proposal. If Congress gives its assent,which is considered likely, then the administration can beginnegotiations with Mexico.   Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Julius Katz told members of thecongressional Joint Economic Committee that if negotiations beginin late spring, he hoped to have an agreement wrapped up by the endof 1991.   That timetable would be significantly faster than the 18 monthsrequired to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Canada.   Katz told reporters later that U.S. negotiators had learned agreat deal from the U.S.-Canada free trade talks and believed thatknowledge could be applied to speeding up a similar agreement withMexico.   Administration officials have said that the Middle East crisishas focused attention on America's trade relationship with Mexico,which has the eighth largest reserve of oil in the world.   The United States would like to work with Mexico in acceleratingoil production in Mexico, which currently stands at about 2.5million barrels of crude daily.   Katz and other administration officials suggested Monday that afree trade agreement with Mexico would be a first step towardachieving the president's goal of a hemisphere-wide free tradezone, an achievement that Katz said could be reached before the endof this decade.   Members of the Joint Economic Committee were generallysupportive of the effort to remove trade barriers between theUnited States and other countries in Latin America although Sen.Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., questioned whether the administration hadfully explored the impact on the U.S. economy.   He questioned whether a free trade zone with Mexico wouldencourage U.S. manufacturers to move their operations to thatcountry, where the costs of labor were lower.   Treasury Under Secretary David Mulford said that while such anagreement would have a big impact on the Mexican economy, anyeffects on the U.S. economy would likely be small given therelative size of the two economies. Mexico's total output is nly 4percent of America's $5 trillion annual economy.   Mulford said that the administration was anxious to complete anagreement with Mexico to reward Mexican President Carlos Salinas deGortari for the free-market economic reforms he has instituted inhis country.   Mexico is America's third largest trading partner, with two-waytrade totaling $51 billion last year.</TEXT></DOC>
