Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FIN WNEWS KNDR </CO><TEXT>   The top trader of mortgage-backed securities at deeply troubled Financial Corp. of America said he plans to resign to become chief financial officer of a Miami-based thrift.    The departure of J. Clark Coleman could well be the first in a series of resignations from Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. and its main unit, American Savings andamp; Loan Association, as federal regulators continue their negotiations for the ailing thrift to be acquired by the Robert M. Bass Group Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas.    &quot;I think we'll have more departures, but I hope that we don't,&quot; Financial Corp. Chairman William J. Popejoy said in an interview. &quot;Able people are going to move to where they have greater opportunity and maybe greater security. . . . To be realistic, until the matter of our future is resolved, people will be recruited away,&quot; Mr. Popejoy said.    Mr. Coleman, 42 years old, currently is an executive vice president of Financial Corp.'s American Savings unit. He said yesterday that he plans to join Miami-based American Savings andamp; Loan Association as chief financial officer. American Savings of Miami is a unit of Montgomery, Ala.-based Kinder-Care Inc., and is unrelated to the identically named Financial Corp. unit.    Mr. Coleman's appointment at the Miami-based thrift is subject to approval by the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, an arm of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Under terms of Kinder-Care's acquisition of American Savings in April, the Atlanta bank has veto power over the thrift's chief executive officer and chief financial officer.    Harris Friedman, chairman of the Miami thrift, said he doesn't expect the Atlanta bank to object to Mr. Coleman's appointment. He said the bank has promised a quick decision.    American Savings of Miami, with assets of about $4.3 billion, is much smaller than the Financial Corp. unit, which has assets of $30 billion and is the nation's second-largest thrift.    Mr. Coleman, a Miami native who has worked in Southern California for seven years, including the last four at Financial Corp., said he wanted a job with broader responsibilities, and felt that his team of subordinates is now fully developed to take over his duties.    He also indicated that the likely capital infusion by Bass Group and the Bank Board signaled that Financial Corp. had lost its struggle to recover under its own steam from $1.7 billion in loan and real estate losses since 1984.    &quot;We have all been in quite a battle here for the last four years,&quot; Mr. Coleman said in an interview. &quot;Unfortunately, the losses were just too great for us to solve . . . . It was almost like the end of an era for me,&quot; he said.    Mr. Coleman's activities, which involved acquiring, financing and trading a portfolio of mortgage-backed securities that once exceeded $18 billion, have been the subject of controversy within the thrift industry and with federal regulators.    Although the portfolio was built up with the Bank Board's permission, it exposed Financial Corp. -- and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. -- to potentially huge losses when interest rates rose. The strategy was much criticized by executives of competing thrifts, and earlier this year the Bank Board ordered Financial Corp. to trim the portfolio by about $2.5 billion.    Mr. Coleman said he disagreed with the Bank Board order, but that it didn't spur his departure. He said the portfolio has yielded $1.5 billion in net interest income and trading profits for Financial Corp., exceeding the paper losses in the portfolio, which he said are currently $900 million to $1 billion. The market value of mortgage-backed securities falls when interest rates rise.    Mr. Popejoy said Financial Corp. probably will divide Mr. Coleman's responsibilities among several current employees and won't name a single successor. </TEXT></DOC>
