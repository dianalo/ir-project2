Two cases are considered: firstly,the acceleration of cluster ions in the mass range between 1 and 100u from 5 to 50 keV/u which is interesting for basic research, secondly,the acceleration of cluster ions in the mass range between 1 and 10{sup6} u from 5 meV to 1 eV/u which is interesting for several technologyapplications. On the basis of the state of the art, the respective RFQstructures turn out to be feasible.</TEXT></DOC>
