(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Upwardly mobile roof rats who preferCalifornia's newer neighborhoods are invading pricey homes, usingnewly planted vines and trees as an above-ground freeway, healthofficials said.   Twice during the past two weeks, wrecker rats have driven LanceFinkel out of his home in Oakland's Montclair district, aneighborhood of $300,000-plus houses in the hills overlooking thecity.   ``They're chewing the house apart,'' said Finkel. ``They'rechewing up the doors and pulling the carpet up, they've chewedthrough the bottom of an armoire. ... They're driving me out of thehouse.''   Even an exterminator wasn't able to solve the problem forFinkel, who is hoping Alameda County's Vector Control unit can stopthe infestation.   The baby boom among roof rats is keeping pace with California'spopulation rise, which saw the number of residents jump 662,000, to28.3 million, this year.   The rodents, which use telephone lines and overhanging trees totravel from city to suburb, are moving in where there was never aproblem before, health officials said.   ``There's a lot of development taking place all over the state.And all these developments are putting in new landscaping. As itmatures, this vegetation provides ideal habitat for roof rats,''said Richard Yercott, a State Health Department biologist.   Complaints about Norway sewer rats, the larger more aggressivecousin found in city slums and waterfronts, used to dominate ratcomplaints in Oakland and the adjacent suburban counties, but notany more.   ``For years the Norways were the prevailing animals, but I thinkthe roof rat is quickly catching up,'' said John Chase, atechnician in Contra Costa County's rodent control unit. Chase says50 percent of his office's calls are about roof rats now.   Alameda County roof rat complaints have increased 50 percentduring the past five years, particularly in Oakland's hill areas,said Harry Scott, manager of Alameda County's Vector Controldistrict.   Sometimes the rats come indoors: ``They suddenly get curious andinvade a home'' and that's when the real trouble begins, Scott said.   One Oakland hills resident called Scott's office when roof ratsscurrying through his house set off the motion detector in his homesecurity system.   In Pleasant Hill, a resident had so many nesting roof rats inher wall that they destroyed her insulation and wiring, Scott said.   Roof rats can carry a considerable number of disease-causingparasites, and their bites are the biggest worry, Scott said.Alameda County averages about five rat bite cases a year, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
