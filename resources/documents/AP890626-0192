The military refused to provide information on army casualties.   The troops and Shining Path rebels fought Sunday evening near thevillage of Pampaccori, 40 miles northeast of Ayacucho, a militaryspokesman said on condition of anonymity.   The military spokesman said troops also captured a large numberof weapons and ``subversive propaganda.''   He said it was one of the biggest losses of life suffered by theShining Path in their nine-year-old fight against the government.   The Ayacucho region, 235 miles southeast of Lima, is thebirthplace of the Shining Path insurgency and remains its stronghold.   The guerrilla organization began its fight against the governmentin May 1980 after 10 years of grass roots organizing among Indianpeasants in this impoverished region.   Since then the violence has spread throughout the country, andmore than 15,000 people have died in clashes between troops andguerrillas, as well as in rebel attacks.   There has been a recent surge in rebel activity, and analysts saythe stepped-up attacks are intended to sabotage municipal electionsin November.
