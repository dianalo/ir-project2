The Act provides new authority to authorize ski areasfor a term of up to 40 years. Previously, ski area permits were issuedunder the authority of the Act of March 4, 1915, which limits permits forresorts and other public facilities to a term of 30 years and a land areanot to exceed 80 acres. The proposed rule set forth the procedures andcriteria that would be applied in evaluating whether existing ski areaspermits qualify for conversion to a longer term. The Forest Service received 9 letters commenting on the proposed rule representinga broad spectrum of interested persons and entities. Respondents includeda trade association representing the interest of ski areas currently holdingspecial use permits, 2 recreation associations representing the interestsof their members, one wildlife interest group, one university departmentof recreation resources, two Federal agencies, one individual permit holder,and one local government. All reviewers provided specific comments andsuggestions on particular provisions. The major comments with the Department'sresponse are presented by section of the proposed rule. A new term permitfor ski areas was developed after publishing the proposed rule. All applicablerequirements of the current rule dealing with special uses, comments receivedon the proposed rule and all requirements of the final rule, are addressedin the permit. The ski industry was consulted during preparation of thepermit. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments Relating to Specific Provisions of the Proposed Rule </ITAG>Section 251.51_Definitions The proposed rule added a definition for ``ski area.'' Three respondentsquestioned what constitutes a ski area. One reviewer questioned what wasmeant by ``preponderance `` This reviewer was concerned over the possibilitythat a ski area might generate a substantial amount of revenue from foodand lodging and therefore not qualify. The common definition of ``preponderance''meaning superiority in numbers, or more than one-half, is intended. A reviewof a representative sample of ski area financial data has shown that revenuefrom the sale of lift tickets and ski school instructions accounts for70 to 90 percent of total revenue subject to fee. It is evident from reviewof this financial data that not enough revenue would accrue from non-skisources that a bonafide ski area would not be qualified to receive a permitunder this authority. One respondent suggested that revenue from ``trail passes'' be insertedinto the list of revenue sources permissible for consideration. The Departmentfeels this improves the definition and has added this term. Two reviewers questioned the meaning of ``ancillary facilities.'' One requestedclarification, wondering if food and lodging facilities would be approvedancillary uses. The other stated that the word was too vague and that itmight include things like condominiums, stores, sewage plants, lodges,and homes for the developer or manager of the facility. While none of thefacilities listed by reviewers are specifically barred from national forestlands, under the appropriate authority, a decision to allow or disallowthem in conjunction with a ski area is a discretionary decision of theForest Service based on the specifics of a proposal. Food service is necessaryfor skiers. Lodging may be permitted if necessary and when private landis not available. A few condominiums have been allowed where private landhas not been available, and their use is strictly controlled. If condominiumswere to be allowed, their occupancy of National Forest System Lands_becauseof the ownership structure of condominiums_would not be authorized underthe Ski Area Permit Act but under another, more appropriate Act. Ski shopsare usually necessary to serve skiers and are allowed. The preferred locationfor sewage treatment plants is not on National Forest Lands. They are,however, not prohibited. The policy regarding employee housing is, likecondominiums, one of giving preference to private land if it is available(without regard to cost). These facilities, with the exception of condominiums,if allowed and owned or under the control of the permittee would be authorizedto occupy National Forest lands under a single ski area permit. The Department does not find that the respondent's concern about appropriatenessof facilities conflicts with the definition as drafted. While everyoneknows a ski area when they see one, it is important that the term ``skiarea'' be defined objectively. By identifying what a ski area is, the proposeddefinition would bar the issuance of a term permit under the authorityof the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act for what are basically summerseason operations but which may install a simple lift or engage in a minornordic ski operation. Therefore, except for the addition of ``trail passes,''the definition is adopted as proposed.Section 251.53. Authorities  This section added the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 to thelist of authorities under which a special use permit can be issued. Thetext of the proposed rule read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">(n) Operation of nordic and alpine ski areas and facilities for upto 40 years and encompassing such acreage as determined necessary as authorizedby the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C 497b).</ITAG>One reviewer recommended that the word ``necessary'' be struck and thatthe phrase, ``sufficient and appropriate to accommodate the permittee'sneeds for ski operations,'' which is a portion of the language containedin the Act, be used instead. The case being made was that the word ``necessary''was unduly restrictive, and that the wording in the law indicates a moreaccommodating posture.  The Department agrees in part. The sentence from the law reads, ``A skiarea permit_ * * * (3) shall encompass such acreage as the Secretary determinessufficient and appropriate to accommodate the permittee's needs for skioperations and appropriate ancillary facilities;* * *.'' Therefore, wehave replaced ``necessary'' with ``sufficient and appropriate.'' However,because the wording proposed by the respondent could give the appearancethat the decision as to what is sufficient and appropriate lies with thepermittee, not with the authorized forest officer, the phrase ``as determinedby the authorized forest officer'' has been added. One respondent questioned the assertion in the proposed rule that the Actdoes not provide authority to issue permits when the improvements are ownedby the United States. In the few cases where improvements are owned bythe Government, the authority remains the Granger-Thye Act of 1950, theonly authority the Forest Service has to rent or lease facilities. Therefore,resorts including ski areas with United States-owned facilities must continueto be authorized under the Granger-Thye Act. Section 251.56(b) Duration and renewability In the proposed rule, the existing text of andSection; 251.56 was designatedas paragraph (b)(1). This paragraph addresses requirements applicable toall authorizations. A new paragraph (b)(2) was added to address the durationand renewability of ski area term permits. One reviewer questioned thelast sentence of paragraph (b)(1) which specifies that authorizations exceeding30 years will provide for revision of terms and conditions at specifiedintervals to reflect changing times and conditions. This is the languagein the current rule and was set out in the proposed rule because paragraph(b) had to be reorganized to accommodate special ski area provisions. Onereviewer commented that the provision was contrary to the intent of theNational Forest Ski Area Permit Act. While the Department does not agreewith the reviewer about the intent of the Act, permit modification fromtime to time is provided for by the terms of the permit. The requirementfor periodic revision was originally implemented for leases and rights-of-wayissued under other authorities. Therefore, the final rule specificallyexempts authorizations issued under the Ski Area Permit Act from revisionat specified intervals. Paragraph (b)(2) of the proposed rule set forth criteria to be consideredin deciding the length of tenure appropriate for a specific ski area specialuse permit. To meet the requirement of the Act, it is necessary that theSecretary establish uniform rules for the Forest Service authorized officerso that there is consistency and even-handed treatment of current and futurepermit holders in determining tenure. Comments were received from threereviewers regarding the criteria to be used by the authorized officer indetermining under what circumstances a permit should be issued for a termof less than 40 years. One reviewer believed it is unnecessary to establish criteria for determiningwhen a permit of less than 40 years should be issued. In lieu of the criteriain the proposed rule, this reviewer felt that the rule should simply restatethe language of the Act that authorizes the Secretary to issue permitsup to 40 years. The Department disagrees.  In charging the Secretary ordinarilyto issue a permit for 40 years unless the Secretary determines there arespecific reasons not to, the Congress effectively directed the Secretaryto establish criteria for making that determination Paragraph (b)(2)(i)(C) of the proposed rule stated that in establishingthe financial need for a 40-year term permit, a permittee could not arguethat the longer term was needed to cover regular, ongoing operation andmaintenance costs. The Department felt this provision was necessary tobar what would effectively be mortgaging the underlying National ForestSystem land by a business that has insufficient cash flow from its operationsto pay expenses. One respondent expressed the position that for a new skiarea a portion of the capital might be needed for these purposes for atleast the first 5 years for operation and this should not bar a permitfrom a full term of 40 years. The Department agrees that the situation described could occur but believesthat the rule should not be changed. Rather, this situation can best behandled by a provision in the ski area permit which grants a long-termpermit but provides 5-year intervals for development and construction.This clause meets the proponent's need for a long-term permit and the Government'sneed to be able to rescind quickly the privileges of the permit shouldthe permittee fail to perform. The clause reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">D. <T3>Term. </T3>For new areas or areas without a Master Development Plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. This authorization is for a term of [5-year maximum] years to providefor the holder to prepare a Master Development Plan. Subject to acceptanceof the Master Development Plan by the authorized officer, this authorizationshall be extended for an additional [5-year maximum] years, for a totalof <T2>XXXXXXXX</T2>years, to provide the holder sufficient time to constructsufficient facilities approved in the Master Development Plan within theschedule outlined in clause III.B. (Site Development Schedule), so thatthe area may be used by the public. Further Provided; This authorizationshall be extended by its terms for an additional [30-year maximum] years,for a total of [40-year maximum] years, if it is in compliance with thesite development schedule in the Master Development Plan and is in operationby the 10-year anniversary date of the issuance of this authorization.Failure of the holder to comply with all or any provisions of this clauseshall cause the authorization to terminate under its terms.</ITAG>The situation this reviewer describes would be satisfactorily accommodatedby this clause. The total length of tenure, however, could be constrainedto less than 40 years if other criteria listed at andSection; 251.56(b)(2)apply.In proposed andSection; 251.56(b)(2)(i)(E), one criterion to be consideredin deciding the length of term would be that the project envisioned inthe Master Development Plan be of such magnitude that long-term financingand operation is clearly warranted. One reviewer expressed the opinionthat the word ``clearly'' added a heightened level of scrutiny that seemedinappropriate and suggested the word be struck. We do not agree. A highlevel of scrutiny is necessary to meet the responsibility to the publicin review and approval of projects which have the potential to occupy publiclands for 40 years. It is, therefore, appropriate that there be a clear,evident need for long term financing and operation.The same reviewer noted that where the proposed Rule referred to a MasterDevelopment Plan, the term was not defined. This reviewer requested thatthe Department explain the role of the Master Development Plan and itsexpected content. The plan is a document prepared by the proponent. Itis a comprehensive and systematic approach to development, encompassingthe entire resort complex as presently envisioned into the future, in connectionwith both private lands and National Forest System lands authorized underthe special use permit. The Master Development Plan may consist of multipledocuments such as the preliminary conceptual proposal, principal developmentalstage, and supplemental revisions_including National Environmental PolicyAct evaluation documents. The plan is dynamic in nature and may requirerevision as the need and changing times dictate. Upon approval, the planrevisions become part of the special use permit by appropriate amendment.Because of the dynamic nature of a Master Development Plan and the varyingcontents depending on the scope of the proposed operation, it is not possibleto define with precision a Master Development Plan. Moreover, it is notnecessary for implementation of the Act to include the definition in therule. A second reviewer posed a concern that the criteria could encourage developmentwhen the owner desires a longer permit. The reviewer argued that, in thequest to obtain a 40-year term, a ski area developer who might otherwisebe satisfied with a small day ski area would be encouraged to build large,expensive facilities and to locate them on National Forest System lands.The Act and congressional intent is clear in this regard. A stated purposeof the Act is to provide for the ``long-term construction, financing, andoperation needs of ski areas on national forest lands.'' The Congress statedthat it expects permits to ordinarily be issued for 40 years. The Departmentbelieves that other factors such as site utility; current and projectedskier demand; market area; financial markets and tax considerations, willdictate the scope of planned development_not the criteria used by the authorizedforest officer to evaluate permit term. Proposed andSection; 251.56(b)(2)(ii)(C) provided that, as a criterion forevaluating the need for a 40-year term permit, the full 40-year tenuremust be consistent with the approved forest land and resource managementplan. Section 6(i) of the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (16 U.S.C1600-1614) requires that permits be consistent with land management plans.Rules implementing Forest Service planning are at 36 CFR Part 219, withminimum management requirements delineated at 36 CFR 219.27. These requirementsessentially summarize other legal requirements such as the Historic PreservationAct, the Endangered Species Act, and good management practices. One reviewerasked that we ``explain the circumstances that might induce the Serviceto write a forest plan that would cause a limitation on the issuance ofa ski area permit.'' In response, resource allocations as developed inthe forest plans might be constraining. An example could be the inabilityto meet all or any of these minimum management constraints in 36 CFR 219.27.In most cases, impacts can be acceptably mitigated. However, a competingpotential use of the land with a higher public benefit could preclude developmentof a ski area. An example would be the need to construct a major reservoirwhich could flood the only potential base area for a ski operation. Whilethe law requires that permits be consistent with plans, this can be achievedby modifying development proposals, by modifying the plans, or both. Forestplans are more likely to identify potential opportunities and local interestin development of a ski area rather than bar their construction. Proposed andSection; 251.56(g) set forth the requirements by which existingpermits may be converted to the longer term permit offered by the new act.The proposal would require the Forest Service to offer a new permit butallows the existing permittee to decide whether or not to convert. Paragraph(g)(3)(ii) would require that any current permittee who consents to conversionmust meet the criteria for determining length of term set forth in andSection;251.56(b)(2). One reviewer recommended this section be eliminated. Thisreviewer contends the criteria are outside the scope of the Act. The Departmentdoes not agree. If a permittee converts to the new permit, the term ofthat permit must be established. The law does not grant an automatic 40-yearterm to converted permits. In fact, in the committee reports accompanyingthe Act, the Congress stated it was not their expectation that every skiarea would get a 40-year term permit, or even that the ``preponderance''of areas get a 40-year term. Existing ski areas vary immensely in financialor operational need. Guidance is necessary to assist the authorized officerin making the determination for length of tenure in the conversion of existingpermitted operations. Because there is no basis for establishing a separatecriterion for terms of converted permits, this criterion is adopted withoutchange in the final rule. Section 251.56(g)(4) of the proposed rule provided that, if a permitteehas declined to accept a new permit under the National Forest Ski AreaPermit Act but subsequently desires a modification to the existing permit,it would be mandatory to obtain a new permit under the new act. This wouldmean that it would not be possible to amend a current ski area term permitissued under the Act of 1915. One reviewer recommended replacement wording:``A holder retains the right to decline a new authorization offered pursuantto this paragraph and to continue to operate under the terms of the existingpermits until the existing term permit expires at which time the holdermust convert to a permit issued under the authority of the National SkiArea Permit Act of 1986.'' The Department disagrees with this recommendation because it precludesamendment of the terms of a permit and would prolong the dual ski areapermit system. It is clear Congress intended to provide for the eventualelimination of the dual permit system. Congress was also sympathetic tothe desire of any permittee who chose to retain existing permits to beable to do so. While an existing holder has the right under the act toaccept or reject a new permit, from time to time it may become necessaryto agree bilaterally to amend a term permit to provide for changed conditions.If a change occurs that would necessitate amendment of the existing termpermit, the Agency should be able to insist that a new permit be issuedunder the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986, to hasten the replacementof the dual permit system. However, the Department is sensitive to thepossible need of some permittees to retain their permits for business orfinancial reasons. Therefore, the final rule has been changed by adding``unless the holder provides compelling justification for retaining theexisting permit.''The proposed rule would have added a new paragraph (h) to andSection; 251.56dealing with periodic revision of ski area authorizations. This sectionwould have provided for a ten-year revision of the terms to be specifiedin the permit to accommodate decisions made in forest resource and landmanagement plan which is to be revised on a 10-15 year cycle. Two reviewerswere concerned that the ten-year provision rule may not be sufficient toallow for placing necessary controls on the permit holder for environmentalprotection. Another respondent cautioned that the requirement was beyondthe scope of the Act. This reviewer took the position that the rule wouldeffectively create a ten-year permit with 3 ten-year renewal options. Inconsidering reviewers' comments, the Forest Service has concluded thatthe intent of this proposed provision can be adequately met by the clausesin the ski area permit which give the authorized officer the authorityneeded to revise permits for environmental protection, public health, andsafety needs. Therefore, paragraph (h) has not been retained in the finalrule. Section 251.17(h)_Rental Fees The proposed rule added a new provision that would make existing ski areapermits subject to any new fee system that might be developed. This provisionalso expressly asserted the authority of the Forest Service to make adjustmentsto the current fee system. Four comments were received on rental fees forski areas. Three of these supported this provision, stressing the importanceof the Forest Service obtaining fair market value for the use of the NationalForest System lands. These reviewers agreed that provisions should be madeto keep the fee system sufficiently flexible so that it will continue toobtain fair market value rental fees and if a new system is developed,that this new system could be applied to all existing permits. The Departmentis directed by the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 (31 U.S.C.9701) and Bureau of the Budget Circular A-25 to receive fair market valuefor permitted uses. In enacting the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act,the Congress reiterated that fees shall be based on fair market value.The Forest Service uses a fee determination method called the GraduatedRate Fee System which was designed to obtain fair market value for thelarger resort developments on the National Forests. The system was designedfrom empirical data of winter sports sites on the National Forests usingrecords maintained for Federal income tax purposes. The fee is a functionof revenue generated and the owner's investment as determined from capitalizedassets. The system, as designed, obtains a fair market value for the useof the National Forest lands. Two respondents objected to paragraph (h) because it would allow the ForestService to make changes to the fee system or to implement a new fee system.However, the basic premise_that these changes would be made to obtain fairmarket value was not challenged by these reviewers. One respondent proposedalternative language which combines the language of the proposed rule withthe requirement to obtain fair market value. The Department agrees withthis, and the reviewers' proposal has been adopted in the final rule. Inaddition, to implement this provision, the following ski area term permitclause has been drafted:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Holder to pay fair market value for the permitted use. </T3>The holdermust pay fair market value for the use of National Forest System land.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The provisions of the Graduated Rate Fee System (GRFS) identifiedunder this permit may be revised by the Forest Service to reflect changedtimes and conditions. Changes will become effective when: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Mutually agreed; or, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Permit is amended for other purposes; or, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. A new permit is issued including reissue after termination. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The Graduated Rate Fee System may be replaced in its entirety bythe Chief of the Forest Service if a new generally applicable fee systemis imposed affecting all holders of authorizations under Pub. L. 99-522.Replacement shall become effective on the beginning of the holder's businessyear following establishment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">General Comments </ITAG>Restriction of access and size of area under permit Five of the 8 reviewers expressed concern regarding the amount of NationalForest System land that would be put under permit for ski areas and possiblelimitation on public access for other forms of recreation imposed by thepermit holder. In response, all National Forest System lands are openedto public entry unless specifically closed. Specific authorization is notrequired to use National Forest System lands or facilities for camping,picnicking, hiking, fishing, hunting, horse riding, boating, or similarrecreational activity, unless specifically closed for good reasons as authorizedin 36 CFR Part 261 Subpart B. There was fear expressed that a 40-year leaseholdestate would be created. Neither the Act nor the regulation would createa leasehold estate. The authorizing document is not a lease but a termpermit, which is defined at andSection; 251.51 as, ``a special use authorizationto occupy and use National Forest System land, other than rights-of-wayunder andSection; 251.53(1) of this part, for a specified period which isboth revocable and compensable according to its terms.'' Pursuant to 36CFR 251.55 which addresses the permittee's ``Nature of Interest'' the Governmentretains the right of access and to make other uses of the area. Neitherthe character and use of the lands nor a permittees interest will changefrom the current situation as a result of issuing a new ski area permit.Regarding the size of the area under permit, although ski areas are currentlyunder the authorization of an annual permit, converting them to a termpermit which may extend to 40 years will not be done without considerationof the consequences. Forest Supervisors will give serious considerationto the placement of the permit boundary and lands included therein andwill continue to be directed by andSection; 251.55(d) which requires thatthe lands under permit will be limited to that which the authorized officerdetermines: (1) Will be occupied by the facilities authorized; (2) to benecessary for the construction, operation, maintenance, and full utilizationof the authorized facilities or the conduct of authorized activities; and,(3) to be necessary to protect the public health and safety and the environment.Lands not currently meeting these criteria will not be included and landswhich in the future fail to meet the criteria may be withdrawn from thepermit unilaterally by the authorized officer. Permit clauses to addressthe size of the area read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Non-exclusive Use. </T3>This permit is not exclusive. The Forest Servicereserves the right to use or permit others to use any part of the permittedarea for any purpose, provided such use does not materially interfere withthe rights and privileges hereby authorized. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Area Access. </T3>Except for any restrictions as the holder and theauthorized officer may agree to be necessary to protect the installationand operation of authorized structures and developments, the lands andwaters covered by this permit shall remain open to the public for all lawfulpurposes. To facilitate public use of this area, all existing roads orroads as may be constructed by the holder, shall remain open to the public,except for roads as may be closed by joint agreement of the holder andthe authorized officer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Periodic Revision. </T3>1. The terms and conditions of this authorizationshall be subject to revision to reflect changing times and conditions sothat land use allocation decisions made as a result of revision to theForest Land and Resource Management Plan may be incorporated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. At the sole discretion of the authorized officer this term permitmay be amended to remove authorization to use any National Forest Systemlands not specifically covered in the Master Development Plan and/or neededfor use and occupancy under this authorization.</ITAG>National Environmental Planning Act Compliance One reviewer submitted comments and recommendations on the Forest Service'spolicy and procedures for complying with the requirements of National EnvironmentalPolicy Act (NEPA) in acting on ski area permits in general. These commentswere beyond the scope of this rule. This reviewer also stated that it wasunclear how the Forest Service reached the position that the promulgationof these rules will have no significant impact on the environment. In response,the Department wants to emphasize that the NEPA process is not in anywaypre-empted by these rules. The focus of the National Forest Ski Area PermitAct was to eliminate the dual permit system by removing the 80-acre limitationand to provide for improved financial security of ski area permittees byincreasing the maximum term from 30 to 40 years. Congress was dealing withthe instruments of authorization and not with land allocation decisionsnor questions of environmental concern. The proposed rule was, therefore,limited to those procedures necessary to implement the Act. For this reason,the proposed rule itself was not found to have a significant effect onthe quality of the human environment. Neither the Act nor these rules relievethe Forest Service in its management of all aspects of the National ForestSystem lands of any duty under any other Act. In fact, compliance withthe National Environmental Policy Act and the National Forest and RangelandsRenewable Resources Planning Act as amended by the National Forest ManagementAct were specifically cited in the National Forest Ski Area Permit Actof 1986. At every decision point for each stage of the development of aski area, it is necessary to undertake environmental analysis and to documentthese analyses in either an Environmental Assessment or an EnvironmentalImpact Statement. The same reviewer took the opportunity to call attention to the necessityfor ski areas to comply with section 319 requirements of the Clean WaterAct of 1987, which establishes a new non-point source management programfor all States and requires that Federal projects be consistent with theState's Management Program. There are many State, local and other Federallaws and regulations which affect ski areas. The rules already requirepermit holders to abide by all applicable laws; therefore, there is noneed for a redundant provision in this rulemaking. In addition, the skiarea permit contains the following clause, which is very similar to thecurrent existing clause found in all special use permits and which addressesthis requirement:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Rules, Laws and Ordinances.</T3> The holder, in exercising the privilegesgranted by this term permit, shall comply with all present and future regulationsof the Secretary of Agriculture and federal laws; and all present and future,state, county, and municipal laws, ordinances, or regulations which areapplicable to the area or operations covered by this permit to the extentthey are not in conflict with federal law, policy or regulation. The ForestService assumes no responsibility for enforcing laws, regulations, ordinancesand the like which are under the jurisdiction of other government bodies.</ITAG>Another respondent was concerned that the 10-year periodic revision ofthe rule may not provide sufficient flexibility for a Forest Supervisorto make mid-term permit modifications in response to impacts to fish andwildlife resources that were unforeseen at the time a permit was issued.The 10-year periodic revision has been dropped (andSection; 251.56(h)). Verystrong controls for all areas of natural resource protection and managementexist in the terms of the permit itself and elsewhere within 36 CFR Parts251 and 261. In addition to the permit clause on Rules, Laws, and Ordinances,the holder is required to maintain the improvements and premises to standardsof repair, orderliness, neatness, sanitation, and safety acceptable tothe authorized officer. Standards are subject to periodic change by theauthorized officer. The holder must prepare and annually revise an operatingplan to cover winter and summer operations as appropriate. The provisionsof the approved operating plan and the annual revisions become a part ofthe permit. In the approval process for the operating plan, the authorizedofficer may define areas to be addressed in addition to the required areasof vegetation management, erosion control, etc. When quick action is needed,the authorized officer may require immediate temporary suspension of theoperation, in whole or in part, when it is determined to protect publichealth, safety, or the environment. One reviewer suggested it would be wise to provide for varying tenure foroccupancy of different structures on national forest lands. The examplewas given that while it may be appropriate to provide long tenure for alift facility, other facilities such as a sewage treatment plant mightwarrant a shorter tenure. The reviewer believes a shorter tenure couldalso be offered to encourage or require that some inappropriate uses bephased out and moved to private lands. For facilities that may cause environmentalproblems, the mechanisms exist under the permit for correcting the problemor removing the facility. If in the planning, it was determined that employeehousing would have to be provided, with the consent of the authorized officer,for the first ten years until a community base was established on privatelands, this could be approved as part of the acceptance of the Master Developmentplan which becomes part of the special use permit. <T3>Transfer of Permits.</T3> One respondent expressed the opinion thatthe Forest Service should be concerned with the transferring of the newlong-term permits to new owners of the improvements. Given the substantiallylonger tenure, they believe some limits and conditions should be set. ExistingandSection; 251.59, Transfer of special use privileges, specifies that abuyer of the permit holders improvements must qualify and agree to complywith and be bound by the terms and conditions of the special use permitand such new conditions as may warrant. In addition, a clause in the skiarea term permits addresses this requirement as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Divestiture of Ownership.</T3> Upon change in ownership of the facilitiesauthorized by this permit, the rights granted under this authorizationmay be transferred to the new owner upon application to and approval bythe authorized officer. The new owner must qualify and agree to complywith and be bound by the terms and conditions of the authorization. Ingranting approval, the authorized officer may modify the terms, conditions,and special stipulations to reflect any new requirements imposed by currentFederal and state land use plans, laws, regulations or other managementdecisions.</ITAG>A concern was also expressed that there was an increasing trend for skiareas to be sold and often to foreign corporations. The Department hasnot seen an increase in the rate of sale of ski areas on National ForestSystem lands. Changes in ownership occur infrequently. We are aware ofonly two areas of 165 which have foreign corporations as parent companies.Without legislation to the contrary, sale to foreign owners is not prohibitedif they meet the financial qualifications. One reviewer believed the new permit presented an opportunity to stronglyendorse and even require major ski areas to be active partners in the Agency'sResort Naturalist program. The Agency is actively working with its skiarea permittees to initiate programs which will increase public understandingand appreciation for natural resource management but does not believe itis appropriate to require participation as a condition of a permit. Having considered the comments received, the Department is adopting finalrules to govern issuance of new ski area permits and conversion of existingski area permits. The rule contains the provisions from the proposed ruleexcept as noted in the preceding responses to comments. These rules addressthe tenure and renewability of ski area permits. The rules do not directlyor indirectly provide for nor abrogate any change to any specific use ofNational Forest System lands or decisions affecting use of these lands.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact </ITAG>This rule has been reviewed under USDA procedures and Executive Order 12291.It has been determined that this regulation is not a major rule. Littleor no effect on the economy will result from this regulation since it affectsonly those parties who occupy or use land within the National Forest Systemfor ski area development. The effect of the law is to marginally increasenet benefits to the Government and the permittees by reducing the numberof special use permits issued and thus the administrative costs associatedwith issuance The issuing of regulations and the conversion of all existingski area permits to the new authority, subject to permittee concurrence,is a requirement of the law governing ski area permits The Department of Agriculture has determined that this action will nothave a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities. Furthermore,it does not directly result in additional procedures or paperwork not alreadyrequired by law. The special use authorization and application proceduresapplicable to obtaining new ski area permits are cleared for the uses ofthis final rule and have been assigned OMB control No. 0596-0082. Theseinformation collection requirements are approved for use through August31, 1989. Information requirements in the ski area permit are currentlyunder review by the Office of Management and Budget, notice of which wasgiven in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 4. 1989, at 54 FR 13537. Based on past experience and environmental analysis, this rule in and ofitself will have no significant effect on the human environment, individuallyor cumulatively. Therefore, it is hereby excluded from documentation inan environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement (40 CFR1508.4). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 36 CFR Part 251 </ITAG>Electrical power, Mineral resources, National forests, Public lands rights-of-way,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Water resources.Therefore, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, Subpart B_SpecialUses of Part 251 of Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amendedas follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 251_LAND USES [AMENDED] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Subpart B_Special Uses [Amended] </ITAG>1.
