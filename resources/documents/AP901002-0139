(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   St. Louis encephalitis, a sometimesfatal viral infection spread by mosquitoes, has struck at least 26people in Florida, the largest outbreak in the state since 1977,health officials said Tuesday.   Tourists and residents were warned to wear long-sleeved shirtsand pants or stay inside at dusk, when the mosquitoes are mostlikely to bite. Boy Scout troops have canceled overnight campingtrips and schools are being sprayed with mosquito killer.   Fifteen of those infected have been hospitalized and two are incomas, state health officials said Tuesday.   ``It's not enough for people not to come to Florida forvacation, but when they come I want them to know they should followprecautions,'' said Dr. Diana Wells, assistant stateepidemiologist.   Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain. St. Louisencephalitis, so named because it was identified there in 1933, isthe most common type and belongs to a family of viruses known asarboviruses.   Symptoms range from headaches and fevers to coma and death.Other symptoms include stiffness of the neck, irritability, extremelethargy, tremors and seizures.   The death rate is usually about 7 percent but no deaths havebeen reported with the latest outbreak, Wells said.   Last month, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta reportedhigh levels of St. Louis encephalitis in Texas and Florida and highlevels of Eastern equine encephalitis - a more deadly arbovirus -in Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey.   Federal health officials reported 108 cases of various arboviralencephalitis last year.   Eight people died during Florida's last severe outbreak in 1977,when 110 cases were reported.   The last major outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis struck nearly3,000 people 15 years ago, the CDC said.   There are usually about three cases a year in Florida, saidErnie Dufree, a spokesman for the state Department of Health andRehabilitative Services.   Since late July, 26 cases have been documented in central andsouthern Florida and preliminary blood tests show that anotherseven are infected, Wells said. About 35 more possible cases arebeing investigated, the CDC said.   The youngest person to be afflicted is 14 and both of thecomatose victims are over 55, Wells said, adding that older peopleare most likely to show symptoms.   The state health department recommends that people stay insidefor an hour before sunset and two or three hours afterward. If theydo go outside, they should wear long pants and sleeves and useinsect repellant, Wells said.   Boy Scout troops in southern and central Florida have canceledovernight camping troops, some high school are playing footballgames during the day rather than at night and several schools havesprayed mosquito killer on campus.   The Florida outbreak is expected to peak early this month andthe mosquitoes will disappear when twilight temperatures fall intothe 60s.</TEXT></DOC>
